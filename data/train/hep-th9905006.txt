    "[ intro ] 0.5 cm during the last few years our understanding of string theory has dramatically increased .",
    "nowadays it is known that all five consistent superstring models ( _ i.e. _ type iia , type iib , type i , @xmath2 heterotic and @xmath3 heterotic @xcite ) and the eleven dimensional supergravity are different perturbative expansions of a unique underlying theory , called m - theory . however , despite numerous attempts and remarkable achievements , we are still far from a complete and satisfactory formulation of m - theory .",
    "the best we can do at present time is to define it by means of the non - perturbative duality relations that connect the various corners of its moduli space corresponding to the different string theories .",
    "establishing ( and checking ) these relations precisely is therefore a necessary step towards a better understanding of m - theory .    one way of testing a duality relation between theory a and theory b is to show that their effective actions are equivalent up to a field redefinition .",
    "in this way , for example , it was discovered that type iib superstring is self - dual @xcite , or that the @xmath2 heterotic string is dual to type i theory @xcite .",
    "of course , by focusing on the effective actions , one checks a duality only at a field theory level , and not in a really stringy way .",
    "however , a deeper understanding can be obtained by looking at the so - called bps states .",
    "these are a special class of states , which are characterized by the key property that their mass is completely determined by their charge under some gauge field .",
    "they form short ( or ultra - short ) multiplets of the supersymmetry algebra of the theory , and because of this fact they are _ stable _ and protected from quantum radiative corrections . therefore ,",
    "their properties can be studied and analyzed perturbatively at weak coupling in the theory a , and then safely extrapolated at strong coupling where they can be reinterpreted in terms of non - perturbative configurations of the dual theory b. a well - known example of such bps states is given by the supersymmetric d@xmath4 branes of type ii theories ( with @xmath4 even in type iia and @xmath4 odd in type iib ) which are charged under the @xmath5 gauge potentials of the r - r sector @xcite . since the bps configurations are protected by non - renormalization theorems , one may legitimately pose the question whether the non - perturbative tests based on them are really a strong evidence for a duality conjecture or simply unavoidable results dictated by supersymmetry alone .",
    "thus , it is of great conceptual importance to analyze a non - perturbative duality beyond the bps level .",
    "to this aim , it is useful to observe that quite often a string theory contains in its spectrum states which are _ stable _ without being bps .",
    "these are in general the lightest states which carry some conserved quantum numbers of the theory . for these states",
    "there is no particular relation between their mass and their charge ; they receive quantum corrections and form long multiplets of the supersymmetry algebra of the theory ( _ i.e. _ they are non - bps ) . however , being the lightest states with a given set of conserved quantum numbers , they are stable since they can not decay into anything else . in general",
    "it is not difficult to find such stable states with the standard perturbative methods of string theory and analyze their properties at weak coupling ; but then a very interesting question can be asked : what happens to these stable states at strong coupling ?",
    "since they can not decay , these states should be present also in the strong coupling regime , and thus , if the string duality relations are correct , one should find stable non - bps states with the right multiplicities and quantum numbers also in the dual theory . to verify",
    "the existence of such states is therefore a very strong ( perhaps the strongest ) check on a non - perturbative duality relation between two string theories .    in these notes ,",
    "following the analysis of a. sen @xcite , we apply this idea to test the heterotic / type i duality @xcite at a non - bps level . in this way",
    "we get a more complete understanding of this non - perturbative relation which , in some sense , has a privileged status : indeed , a study of the web of string dualities @xcite shows that all of them can be `` derived '' from it by combining it with t - duality .    at the first massive level the @xmath2 heterotic string contains perturbative states which are stable but not bps .",
    "their stability follows from the fact that they are the lightest states carrying the quantum numbers of the spinor representation of the gauge group .",
    "since they can not decay , these states should be present also in the strong coupling regime . then ,",
    "if the heterotic / type i duality is correct , type i theory should support non - perturbative stable configurations that are spinors of so(32 ) .",
    "it turns out @xcite that a pair formed by a d1-brane and an anti d1-brane of type i ( wrapped on a circle and with a @xmath6 wilson line ) describes a configuration with the quantum numbers of the spinor representation of so(32 ) .",
    "thus this system is the right candidate to describe in the non - perturbative regime the stable non - bps states of the heterotic string mentioned above .",
    "however , a superposition of a brane with an anti - brane is unstable due to the presence of tachyons in the open strings stretching between the brane and the anti - brane @xcite .",
    "then the problem of defining properly this superposition and treating its tachyon instability arises .",
    "this has been addressed by a. sen in a remarkable series of papers @xcite . in particular in ref .",
    "@xcite he considered a d - string / anti - d - string pair of type iib , and managed to prove that when the tachyon condenses to a kink along the ( compact ) direction of the d - string , the pair becomes tightly bound and , as a whole , behaves as a d - particle .",
    "he also computed its mass finding that it is a factor of @xmath7 bigger than the one of the supersymmetric bps d - particle of type iia theory .",
    "the presence of a d - particle in type iib spectrum looks surprising at first sight since one usually thinks that in type iib there are only d@xmath4 branes with @xmath4 odd .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that such a d - particle is a non - supersymmetric and non - bps configuration .",
    "furthermore it is unstable , due to the fact that there are tachyons in the spectrum of the open strings living on its world - line .",
    "these tachyons turn out to be odd under the world - sheet parity @xmath8 , and hence disappear if one performs the @xmath8 projection to get the type i string @xcite .",
    "therefore , the d - particle found by sen is a stable non - perturbative configuration of type i that transforms as a spinor of so(32 ) .",
    "another interesting example of stable non - bps configurations that can be used to check a non - perturbative duality relation is provided by the states that live on the world - volume of a d5 brane of type iib on top of an orientifold @xmath9 plane @xcite .",
    "the theory which supports these states is obtained by modding out type iib theory in ten dimensions by @xmath10 where @xmath8 is the world - sheet parity ( the twist operator ) and @xmath11 is the space - time parity which changes the sign of four of the space - like coordinates , _",
    "[ orientifold ] this theory contains 32 d5-branes which are pairwise located on top of 16 orientifold 5-planes .",
    "the open strings that start and end on the two mirror d5 branes of a given orientifold plane are charged under an abelian gauge potential .",
    "it turns out that the lightest states which carry this abelian charge are at mass - level one , and thus are non - bps but stable . to describe these states at strong coupling",
    ", we perform an s - duality transformation which maps the twist parity @xmath8 to @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the left part of the space - time fermion number operator .",
    "thus , the s - dual theory of ( [ orientifold ] ) is the orbifold / ( -1)^f_l i_4  , [ orbifold ] which contains the usual untwisted sector together with a twisted sector localized on the orbifold fixed plane . in particular at the massless level",
    "there are , among other fields , a 2-form ramond - ramond potential @xmath14 arising from the untwisted r - r sector and a 1-form ramond - ramond potential @xmath15 arising from the twisted r - r sector .",
    "it turns out ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) that the consistent bps states of this orbifold theory must be charged both under @xmath14 and under @xmath15 . therefore , they are d1-branes which carry also the charge of an abelian vector potential .",
    "given this fact , it is then natural to conjecture that the non - bps states which we are looking for can be obtained as a superposition of one d1-brane and one anti - d1-brane of this kind .",
    "indeed , by taking this combination we cancel the charge of @xmath14 and obtain a solitonic configuration which carries only the charge of an abelian vector potential and behaves as a d - particle .",
    "this construction has been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite using the boundary state formalism @xcite in which the d - branes are described by a closed string state ( the boundary state ) that inserts a boundary on the string world - sheet and enforces on it the appropriate boundary conditions  .",
    "in particular , after treating properly the tachyon instability on the brane / anti - brane pair in the orbifold model ( [ orbifold ] ) , a stable d - particle state has been explicitly constructed and its mass has been computed .",
    "of course a similar analysis can be done also in other orbifold models @xcite which involve d - branes of different dimensionality ( see for a review ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    like in the heterotic / type i case ,",
    "also in the orbifold theory ( [ orbifold ] ) one finds that the stable non - bps states predicted by duality arise from an unstable system formed by a d - string / anti - d - string pair of type iib in which the tachyon field acquires a solitonic kink configuration .",
    "thus , one may wonder whether this mechanism is peculiar to the two cases we have mentioned , or can occur in more general situations .",
    "this question has been considered recently by several authors @xcite using different methods , and new kinds of relation between bps and non - bps branes have been discovered .",
    "it is natural to hope that they may provide new ideas and clues to understand better the various d - branes and their fundamental role in string ( or m ) theory .    for type ii theories these new relations",
    "are represented in fig .",
    "1 . let us start from a pair formed by a d@xmath4 brane and an anti - d@xmath4 brane of type iib ( _ i.e. _ @xmath4 odd ) which , as mentioned above , is an unstable system due to the presence of an open - string tachyon on its world - volume .",
    "if we condense this tachyon into a solitonic kink solution , then the resulting bound state describes a non - bps d@xmath16 brane of type iib @xcite . in these notes",
    "we will discuss in some detail only the case @xmath17 which is relevant of the heterotic / type i duality , but the same arguments can be used in all other cases as well .",
    "the non - bps d@xmath16 brane of type iib constructed in this way is unstable because its world volume theory contains again a tachyonic excitation ( which has nothing to do with the previous one ) .",
    "if we repeat the procedure and make this second tachyon field condense into a solitonic kink solution , we obtain as a result a d@xmath18 brane of type iib , which is supersymmetric and stable @xcite .",
    "these descent relations , which of course can be established also with the d - branes of type iia theory , are represented by the vertical arrows in fig . 1 .",
    "now let us consider another kind of relations between bps and non - bps branes .",
    "again we start from the d@xmath4/anti - d@xmath4 pair of type iib and see what happens when we mod out the system by @xmath19 .",
    "acts on the closed string states by simply changing the sign of every state that has a left - moving part in the r sector .",
    "thus , it is an exact symmetry of type ii theories ; in particular @xmath12 transforms a d@xmath4 brane into an anti - d@xmath4 brane and viceversa .",
    "therefore a brane / anti - brane pair is invariant under this operator and so it is meaningful to ask what happens when we mod it out .",
    "] a detailed analysis of the open strings that live on its world - volume shows that the configuration one obtains after modding out @xmath12 has the same features of a d@xmath4 brane of type iia .",
    "since @xmath4 is odd , this must be a non - supersymmetric and non - bps brane . by modding out",
    "once more by @xmath12 one goes back to type iib theory and finds a stable and supersymmetric d@xmath4 brane @xcite .",
    "these relations are represented by the horizontal arrows in fig.1 . by exploiting all these relations ( as well the usual t - duality )",
    "we can conclude that actually all branes of type ii theories descend from a bound state of d9 and anti - d9 branes , a fact that has been used in refs .",
    "@xcite to show that the d - brane charges take values in the k - theory of space time ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "these notes are organized as follows : in section  [ pert ] we briefly summarize the essential perturbative features of the @xmath2 heterotic string and of the type i theory ; in section  [ d1 ] we study in some detail the d1 brane of type i and the open string excitations that live on its world - sheet and discuss their relations with the heterotic theory . in section  [ d0 ]",
    "we show how a stable d - particle configuration of type i can be constructed from an unstable d1/anti - d1 pair and study the mechanism of tachyon condensation from the effective field theory point of view . in sections 5 and 6 we put these results on more solid ground by providing an exact conformal description of the non - bps d - particle , and finally in appendix",
    "a we collect a few technical details on the bosonization procedure which is used in the conformal field theory analysis .",
    "most of our presentation in the last sections is based in an essential way on the series of papers by a. sen @xcite .",
    "[ pert ] 0.5 cm in this section we are going to summarize the essential perturbative features of the @xmath2 heterotic string and of the type i theory that will be relevant for our later discussions . in subsection 2.1",
    "we briefly analyze the spectrum of the heterotic string and show that the states in the spinor representation of @xmath2 are non - bps but stable .",
    "then , in subsection 2.2 we describe the content of the type i string viewed as an orientifold of type iib theory .",
    "in particular we focus on the open string sector and also discuss the main properties of the so - called 1 - 1 strings that live on the world - sheet of the d1 branes of the theory .",
    "0.2 cm the heterotic string is a theory of closed oriented strings with a local gauge invariance in ten dimensions . roughly speaking",
    ", it can be considered as a combination of the bosonic string and the superstring .",
    "the basic idea of the heterotic construction is to exploit the holomorphic factorization between the left and the right moving modes of closed strings and to treat them in two different ways . in particular , in the right sector one introduces the usual field content of the superstring , _",
    "i.e. _ bosonic and fermionic coordinates @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 ( plus the corresponding ghosts and superghosts ) , and performs the standard gso projection . in the left sector , instead , one introduces only bosonic coordinates @xmath23 with @xmath24 ( plus the corresponding ghosts ) .",
    "since not all @xmath25 s can be interpreted as spacetime coordinates , the left - moving sector is naturally divided in two sets : when @xmath26 , the fields @xmath23 are combined with @xmath20 to build the usual closed string coordinates @xmath27 , while for @xmath28 , the left - moving fields @xmath23 are interpreted as internal degrees of freedom that can propagate on the world - sheet .",
    "we will label these sixteen internal coordinates with an index @xmath29 .    given this field content",
    ", it is easy to realize that a typical element of the fock space of the heterotic theory is a tensor product of a left and a right state , and looks like @xmath30 where , in an obvious notation , we have denoted by @xmath31 and @xmath32 the creation modes of the bosonic fields and by @xmath33 the creation modes of the fermionic coordinates .",
    "these ones have half - integer indices in the ns sector and integer indices in the r sector .",
    "notice that the left vacuum in eq .",
    "( [ state0 ] ) depends on the spacetime momentum @xmath34 as well as on the internal momentum @xmath35 , whereas the right vacuum depends only on @xmath34 .",
    "if one considers states in the r sector , the right vacuum will carry also a spinor label ; in these notes however , we will not consider explicitly this case and focus only on the ns sector .",
    "the states of the form ( [ state0 ] ) are not all acceptable in the heterotic theory ; indeed a physical state @xmath36 must satisfy the virasoro constraints .",
    "in particular the mass - shell condition is @xmath37 where we have used the values of the intercept of the bosonic theory ( @xmath38 ) in the left sector and of the ns superstring ( @xmath39 ) in the right sector . by expanding @xmath40 in modes , one easily finds from the second equality in eq .",
    "( [ hetl0 ] ) that the mass @xmath41 of a state is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the total number of right moving oscillators .",
    "from the first equality of eq .",
    "( [ hetl0 ] ) one can derive a generalized level matching condition which relates @xmath43 to the total number of left moving oscillators @xmath44 that are present in a given state .",
    "this condition reads as follows @xmath45 where we have conveniently measured the internal momenta @xmath35 in units of @xmath46 .",
    "further restrictions come from the gso projection that one has to perform in the right sector to have a consistent model .",
    "in particular , the gso projection on ns states selects only half - integer occupation numbers @xmath47 . since the left occupation number @xmath44 is always integer as in the bosonic theory , in order to be able to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ lmc ] ) , the internal momenta @xmath35 have to be quantized .",
    "in particular , the quantity @xmath48 has to be an even number .",
    "this condition implies that the internal coordinates @xmath49 must be compactified on an _ even _",
    "16-dimensional lattice .",
    "the intrinsic consistency of the theory , and more specifically the modular invariance of the one - loop partition function , requires that this lattice be also _ self - dual_. it can be shown that there exist only two 16-dimensional lattices satisfying both these properties : the root lattice of @xmath3 , and a @xmath6 sublattice of the weight lattice of @xmath2 . since we are interested in the heterotic theory with gauge group @xmath2 , for the rest of these notes , we will focus only on the second lattice which is denoted by @xmath50 and is defined by @xmath51 it is interesting to observe that even if in the original formulation only a @xmath52 symmetry is manifest , when the internal coordinates are compactified on @xmath50 , the resulting gauge group is much bigger .",
    "this fact can be explicitly checked by counting how many massless states involving the internal coordinates @xmath49 are present in the theory . because of eq .",
    "( [ hetmass ] ) , all such states must have @xmath53 , so that their right - moving part is simply @xmath54 where @xmath55 labels the directions transverse to the light - cone . on the other hand , the level matching condition ( [ lmc ] ) requires that @xmath56 this condition can be satisfied either by taking @xmath57 and @xmath58 , or by taking @xmath59 and the momenta @xmath35 to be of the form @xmath60 ( or any permutation thereof ) . with the first choice",
    ", we construct 16 states @xmath61 , while with the second choice we construct 480 states @xmath62 .",
    "altogether we have 496 massless states that carry a spacetime vector index from the right - moving part and span the adjoint representation @xmath63 of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , they can be legitimately identified with the gauge fields of @xmath2 .",
    "the fact that a system of bosonic fields compactified on an appropriate space exhibits an enlarged symmetry can be understood also from a different point of view through the bosonization procedure @xcite ( see also appendix a for some details ) .",
    "in fact by exploiting the equivalence between a compact boson and two fermions , one can substitute the original coordinates @xmath49 with 32 fermions @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) directly in the sigma model lagrangian of the heterotic theory , thus making manifest the @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "it is important to realize that there are 64 more bosonic massless states in the theory which correspond to @xmath53 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and are given by @xmath66 where the indices @xmath67 run along the transverse directions @xmath68 .",
    "these states are clearly singlets with respect to the gauge group but are space - time tensors . decomposing them into irreducible components , we get a graviton , a dilaton and an antisymmetric two - index tensor . in conclusion ,",
    "the bosonic massless states of the heterotic theory are in the following representations @xmath69 where in each term the two labels refer to the lorentz and gauge groups respectively . by analyzing the r sector",
    ", one finds an equal number of fermionic massless states that complete the @xmath57 supersymmetric multiplets .",
    "let us now consider the first excited level of the ns sector that consists of states with @xmath70 and mass squared @xmath71 .",
    "there are 128 ways to realize @xmath72 , namely @xmath73 these massive states represent a symmetric two - index tensor and an antisymmetric three - form under the lorentz group .",
    "in fact , the antisymmetric part of eq .",
    "( [ 2lr ] ) together with the states ( [ 3lr ] ) completes a massive three - form transforming in the representation * 84 * of the lorentz group , while the remaining states transform together as a symmetric two - index tensor in the representation * 44*. the level matching condition ( [ lmc ] ) requires to make a tensor product with left - moving configurations such that @xmath74 there are 73,764 ways to satisfy this requirement ! the complete list of the corresponding states can be found for example on pag .",
    "342 of ref .",
    "@xcite where it is shown that they transform as scalars , spinors , second - rank antisymmetric tensors , fourth - rank antisymmetric tensors and second - rank symmetric traceless tensors of @xmath2 . here",
    "we focus on the @xmath75 states that are obtained by taking in eq .",
    "( [ lmc2 ] ) @xmath59 and momenta @xmath35 of the form @xmath76 with an even number of plus signs .",
    "notice that these momenta define a point in the lattice @xmath50 , since they satisfy the second condition of eq .",
    "( [ gamma16 ] ) , and correspond to the _ spinor _ representation of @xmath2 . indeed , similarly to what happens with the usual spin fields",
    ", half - integer valued momenta always produce states which are spinors of the symmetry group . by combining these left modes with the right - moving ones of eqs .",
    "( [ 1lr ] ) - ( [ 3lr ] ) , we then obtain bosonic states transforming as @xmath77 analyzing the first excited level of the r sector , one can find 128 massive fermionic states which transform in the spinor representation of @xmath2 and complete the @xmath57 supersymmetry multiplets .",
    "thus , altogether the spinors of @xmath2 appear with 256 different polarizations , 128 bosonic and 128 fermionic , which correspond to a _ long _ multiplet of the @xmath57 supersymmetry algebra in ten dimensions .",
    "thus , these states can not satisfy the bps condition @xcite but are , nevertheless , stable .",
    "indeed , as we have seen , at the massless level there are no spinors of @xmath2 and thus the states we have found are the lightest ones with these quantum numbers and hence can not decay . as it was observed on pag .",
    "343 of ref .",
    "@xcite , this feature makes these spinors `` absolutely stable , which might be an interesting prediction for the so(32 ) heterotic theory '' .",
    "this expectation is going to be confirmed within the non - perturbative duality between the @xmath2 heterotic string and the type i theory .      0.2 cm the type i string theory is a @xmath57 supersymmetric model in ten dimensions that consists of both open and closed _ unoriented _ strings with the usual gso projection .",
    "it is by now well - known that the type i theory can be interpreted as an orientifold of type iib theory , which is a chiral model consisting only of closed oriented strings @xcite . for a general discussion on the orientifold projection we refer for example to ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "it is sufficient to recall that the orientifold projection is defined by means of a discrete transformation @xmath8 which in general can mix the world - sheet parity with a space - time operation .",
    "then , a new consistent spectrum is obtained by removing all states of the original theory that are not invariant under @xmath8 , and by adding new states that are defined by a generalized periodicity condition on the string coordinates ( the so - called twisted sector ) .    for the type",
    "i theory , the operator @xmath8 is simply the world - sheet parity , namely @xmath78 from this definition , it is easy to derive the action of @xmath8 on the string modes ; in fact , by expanding the closed string coordinates in the usual manner @xmath79 ~~ , \\label{xexpan}\\ ] ] one immediately sees that @xmath8 interchanges the left and the right moving oscillators , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath80 world - sheet supersymmetry requires that also the fermionic coordinates @xmath81 and @xmath82 transform in a similar way , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath83 where the moding index @xmath84 is half - integer in the ns sector and integer in the r sector . to proceed further",
    ", we have to specify also the action of @xmath8 on the ground states . for simplicity , we choose the @xmath85 superghost picture in the ns - ns sector and the @xmath86 superghost picture in the r - r sector @xcite .",
    "since on the matter fields @xmath8 simply exchanges the left and the right sector , it is natural to assume that @xmath87 for the ns - ns sector , and @xmath88 for the r - r sector , with @xmath89 and @xmath90 being the left and right spin fields in the chiral spinor representation of @xmath91 .",
    "notice that the @xmath92 signs in eqs .",
    "( [ omevac ] ) and ( [ omevac1 ] ) originate from the exchange of the left and right vacua which have fermionic statistics .    using these rules , it is easy to see which states of type iib theory are even under @xmath8 and must be kept , and which states are odd and must be removed",
    ". let us consider for example the massless states of the ns - ns sector which are represented by @xmath93 where the polarization tensor satisfies @xmath94 with @xmath95 . then , using eqs .",
    "( [ omepsi ] ) and ( [ omevac ] ) we can obtain @xmath96 so that only the states with symmetric polarizations are invariant under @xmath8 .",
    "thus , only the graviton and the dilaton survive the @xmath8 projection while the antisymmetric kalb - ramond field is removed .",
    "now , let us consider the massless states of the r - r sector which are represented by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "this state is physical if the antisymmetric polarization tensor satisfies @xmath99 which are precisely the bianchi identities and the maxwell equations for a field strength .",
    "then , using eqs .",
    "( [ omepsi ] ) and ( [ omevac1 ] ) , we easily find @xmath100 so that only those states for which @xmath101 are even under @xmath8 and must be kept .",
    "a little algebra shows that eq .",
    "( [ orr ] ) is true if @xmath102 , so that the only r - r potentials that survive the @xmath8 projection are a 2-form , its magnetic dual 6-form and a non - dynamical 10-form .",
    "consequently , in the type i theory only d1 , d5 and d9-branes can exist as ( isolated ) brane configurations that carry r - r charges .    as we have mentioned before , the closed string states which are invariant under @xmath8 do not represent the whole content of the theory .",
    "in fact , in the orientifold construction one can also impose twisted boundary conditions on the string coordinates , that is one can require that they be periodic up to an @xmath8 transformation",
    ". in our case this amounts to impose that @xmath103 where in the last step we have used the explicit definition ( [ parity ] ) .",
    "it is easy realize that the twisted boundary condition ( [ tws ] ) enforces an identification between the left and the right - moving parts since it implies that @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the string coordinates which satisfy eq .",
    "( [ tws ] ) and which we denote by @xmath105 , have the same mode expansion as the coordinates of the _ open _ string with neumann boundary conditions , namely @xmath106 then , from eq .",
    "( [ parity ] ) it is immediate to see that the action of the world - sheet parity on the oscillators of @xmath107 is @xmath108 similarly , one finds that the fermionic oscillators of the open sector have the following transformation rule @xmath109 to complete our description , we have to specify also the action of @xmath8 on the ground states of the open sector . for simplicity and in analogy with what we have done before ,",
    "we choose the @xmath110 superghost picture for the ns sector and the @xmath111 superghost picture for the r sector @xcite .",
    "then , in an obvious notation , we posit that @xmath112 and @xmath113 with this choice the massless states of both the ns and r sectors are odd under @xmath8 and thus are removed from the spectrum .",
    "this is a standard result for unoriented open strings _ without _ chan - paton factors . on the contrary ,",
    "if at the endpoints of the open strings we introduce chan - paton labels for the group @xmath114 , then the ns and r massless states can survive the @xmath8 projection . in this case , then , the spectrum will contain also @xmath114 vector gauge fields and their superpartners .",

    "this is a space - time filling object that is not dynamical , since no open strings can end on it , change its shape or switch on a gauge field .",

    ", the r - r charge of the @xmath116-plane is @xmath117 . ] in order to cancel the tadpoles associated to these massless states , one is forced to modify the definition of the background of the theory by adding 32 d9-branes .",
    "this is clearly equivalent to introduce a sector of open strings with neumann boundary conditions .",
    "moreover , since there are 32 different d9 branes on which the open strings can terminate , it is as if their end - points carry 32 different charges , thus inducing the @xmath2 gauge group .    as we have mentioned before ,",
    "also d1 and d5 branes are compatible with the orientifold projection ( or equivalently with the presence of the orientifold @xmath116-plane ) . therefore ,",
    "besides the sectors previously considered , the type i theory contains also other sectors corresponding to open strings defined on these d - branes . since in particular the open strings living on the d1 branes of type i are relevant for our later discussion",
    ", we now discuss their main properties .",
    "let us consider a supersymmetric d1 brane of type i , and the open strings that live on its two - dimensional world - sheet .",
    "these strings , called 1 - 1 strings since they have both end - points on the d1 brane , are characterized by two longitudinal coordinates @xmath118 with neumann boundary conditions ( @xmath119 ) and by eight transverse coordinates @xmath120 with dirichlet boundary conditions ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "the longitudinal coordinates have the usual mode expansion as in eq .",

    "is replaced by @xmath125 . ] consequently , the action of @xmath8 on the `` dirichlet '' oscillators is different from the one on the `` neumann '' oscillators which we have discussed in the previous subsection . indeed , using eqs .",
    "( [ parity ] ) and ( [ opexpand ] ) , it is easy to find that @xmath126 to be compared with eq .",
    "( [ oopn1 ] ) .",
    "world - sheet supersymmetry requires that the action of @xmath8 on the fermionic oscillators in the dirichlet directions be given by @xmath127 for both the ns and r sectors . finally , on the ground states of the 1 - 1 strings one has @xcite",
    "@xmath128 for the ns sector in the -1 superghost picture , and @xmath129 for the r sector in the @xmath130 superghost picture .",
    "( [ oopd3 ] ) is identical to the corresponding one for the purely neumann strings since the ns vacuum , being a lorentz scalar , is insensitive to the extra minus sign that @xmath8 picks up in the dirichlet directions . on the contrary ,",
    "the r vacuum is a ( chiral ) spinor , and the extra minus sign in the action of @xmath8 on the transverse fermions @xmath131 is not irrelevant , and indeed it translates into the particular structure of eq .",
    "( [ oopd4 ] ) .    using these rules",
    ", one can easily find that the spectrum of the 1 - 1 open strings of type i contains eight massless states both in the ns and in the r sector .",
    "the massless modes of the ns sector correspond to a vector that accounts for the freedom of translating the d1 brane along its eight transverse directions .",
    "the massless states of the r sector , instead , correspond to a chiral spinor @xmath132 such that @xmath133 , as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ oopd4 ] ) .",
    "upon quantization , the eight components of @xmath132 account for the @xmath134 degeneracy of the d1 brane of type i , as it should be expected for a bps configuration of the @xmath57 supersymmetry algebra in ten dimensions .",
    "we conclude by mentioning that in the type i theory there exist also open strings with mixed boundary conditions : neumann at one end - point and dirichlet at the other one .",
    "strings of this kind are for example the 1 - 9 open strings that are suspended between a d1 brane and one of the d9-branes of the type i background , or the 9 - 1 strings which have the opposite orientation .",
    "these strings are characterized by eight directions with mixed boundary conditions , and the states in their spectrum can not be eigenvectors of @xmath8 since this operator transforms a neumann - dirichlet string into a dirichlet - neumann one . in this case , then , the orientifold projection simply requires to keep all symmetric combinations of 1 - 9 and 9 - 1 configurations .",
    "[ d1 ] 0.5 cm the @xmath2 heterotic string and the type i theory discussed in the previous section look so different from each other that they seem completely unrelated .",
    "the only evident similarity between them is that they have the same massless field content .",
    "however , this fact could be interpreted simply as an accident due to supersymmetry , because in ten dimensions the invariance under local supersymmetry completely determines the form of the action for gauge fields coupled to gravity .",
    "this interpretation seems to be further confirmed by the fact that any resemblance between the spectra of the two theories disappears as soon as one goes to the first excited level .",
    "for instance , we have mentioned that in the heterotic theory the states of the first mass level do not always transform in the same way under the gauge group , but can be scalars , spinors , second - rank symmetric traceless tensors , second - rank or fourth - rank antisymmetric tensors of @xmath2 @xcite . on the contrary , in the type",
    "i theory the color degrees of freedom are encoded through the chan - paton factors ( or through the 32 d9-branes of the type i background in the modern language ) and thus all perturbative states of this model transform in the adjoint representation of @xmath2 .",
    "this is a standard result that occurs in any string theory where the gauge group is introduced by means of the chan - paton procedure .",
    "however , despite the appearance , we nowadays know that the @xmath2 heterotic string and the type i theory describe the same physics @xcite , and are actually the two members of a dual pair of theories related to each other in a non - perturbative way .",
    "the first hint of this equivalence comes from the structure of their low - energy effective actions .",
    "focusing for example on the kinetic term of the gauge fields , one has @xmath135\\ ] ] for the heterotic string , and @xmath136\\ ] ] for the type i theory . in these expressions",
    ", @xmath137 denotes the ( string frame ) metric , @xmath138 the dilaton field , and @xmath139 the @xmath2 field strength .",
    "the two actions ( [ 1hact ] ) and ( [ 2hact ] ) can be mapped into each other by a field redefinition that involves a change of the metric @xmath140 and a change of the dilaton @xmath141 since @xmath142 is the string coupling constant , eq .",
    "( [ dilaton ] ) implies that if there has to be any relation between the heterotic and the type i strings , then the strong coupling of one theory has to be connected to the weak coupling of the other .",
    "this fact also explains why the two perturbative spectra are so different ; indeed , by increasing the value of the coupling constant , a generic perturbative heterotic state becomes highly unstable and is not expected to appear in the type i theory , and viceversa .",
    "however there are some string configurations that can not decay ; for this reason , they are expected to be present in both theories at all values of the coupling constant , in particular in the strong coupling region of one theory or , equivalently , in the weak coupling regime of the dual theory .",
    "finding such stable states and checking their multiplicities is therefore a test of the duality conjecture that goes well beyond the arguments based on the structure of the effective actions .",
    "a well known class of such stable configurations consists of the bps states .",
    "the main feature of these states is that they are annihilated by some supersymmetry generators so that they carry a charge under one of the gauge fields present in the theory and possess a mass which is completely determined by this charge . furthermore , these bps configurations are protected from quantum radiative corrections , and thus it is particularly simple to follow their fate when the coupling constant is increased .",
    "for instance , a heterotic string wrapped around a compact dimension breaks half the original supersymmetries and is charged under the antisymmetric two - form present in the gravitational multiplet , the charge being simply its winding number .",
    "this is a bps configuration and hence it should appear in the type i theory as a supersymmetric soliton .",
    "the natural candidate for this is the d1 brane of type i , since one expects that the gravitational two - form gauge field is mapped in the r - r one , just like in the strong / weak duality of type iib string . since we are considering bps configurations",
    ", we can immediately test this proposal .",
    "in fact , if it is correct , the tension @xmath143 of the fundamental heterotic string should exactly match the tension @xmath144 of the d1 brane of type i. this is indeed what happens if we use eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) to set the same scale in both theories .",
    "the identification between the d1 brane of type i and the fundamental string of the heterotic theory can be tested at a deeper level ; in fact it is possible to show that the world - sheet structure of a ( wrapped ) heterotic string is exactly reproduced by the world - sheet dynamics on a ( wrapped ) d1 brane @xcite .",
    "here we recall this argument . in the presence of a d1 brane , the space - time is naturally divided into a two - dimensional minkowski part along the world - sheet of the d1 brane ( spanned by @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) , and an eight - dimensional euclidean part transverse to it ( spanned by @xmath147 ) .",
    "consequently , the lorentz group @xmath91 is broken into @xmath148 .",
    "the space transverse to the d1 brane is going to be identified with the space where the heterotic string is embedded in the light - cone gauge , while the world - sheet of the d1 brane is going to play the role of the world - sheet of the heterotic string . to see this , we will first consider the lightest states of the 1 - 1 open strings attached to the d1 brane which are responsible for its dynamics , and then identify the corresponding massless fields with the various string coordinates of the heterotic theory . in the ns sector",
    "we can construct the following massless states @xmath149 with @xmath95 .",
    "since the momentum @xmath150 is only along the longitudinal directions , the field associated to this state will depend only on @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",

    "for example , if we define the spinor representation @xmath193 to be even under @xmath220 , then it is clear that the states in the other spinor representation @xmath194 are odd , since they contain one more fermionic zero - mode that brings a chan - paton factor @xmath222 or @xmath223 , and hence an extra @xmath92 sign under @xmath220 .",
    "thus , the states of @xmath194 are gauged away and the physical degrees of freedom correspond only to the representation @xmath193 , just as the heterotic gso projection requires . however , as we know very well , this is not the whole story , since in gauging a discrete symmetry one has also to consider the twisted sector .",

    "therefore , one can say that introducing this wilson line is equivalent to introducing the twisted sector of @xmath64 under @xmath220 . of course , also among the states of the twisted sector we have to select only the @xmath220-invariant ones , which have an even number of @xmath64 oscillators , since each one of them contributes with a @xmath92 sign to the @xmath220 parity .",
    "then , one can check that , for example , the vector representation @xmath218 is gauged away while the representations @xmath217 and @xmath63 are kept , thus reproducing the condition @xmath225 of the heterotic side ( see eq .",

    "[ d0 ] 0.5 cm up to now , we have focused on bps objects and exploited their stability to make a test of the non - perturbative duality between the @xmath2 heterotic string and the type i theory .",
    "however , string theories often contain in their spectrum states that are _ stable _ but non - bps , and thus one may wonder whether such states can provide the basis for duality tests that are less dependent on supersymmetry .",
    "let us consider for instance a dual pair of theories @xmath196 and @xmath226 , and take all perturbative states of @xmath196 that carry the same set of conserved quantum numbers @xmath227 .",

    "if the duality between @xmath196 and @xmath226 is correct , there should exist stable non - perturbative configurations of @xmath226 with the quantum numbers @xmath227 .",
    "finding such configurations and checking their multiplicities is therefore a significant test of the duality between @xmath196 and @xmath226 which does not rely on bps or supersymmetry arguments . in this section",
    "we are going to apply this strategy and confirm the @xmath2 heterotic / type i duality by using stable non - bps objects .",
    "then , in the following section we will put on more solid ground our results by providing an exact conformal field theory description of these non - bps configurations .    we have encountered absolutely stable states when we studied the first excited level of the perturbative spectrum of the heterotic string : in fact , the massive states in the representation @xmath193 of @xmath2 are the lightest ones transforming as spinors of the gauge group , since the massless level contains only states in the singlet and adjoint representations of @xmath2 ( see eq .",
    "( [ repre1 ] ) ) .",
    "thus , if the heterotic / type i duality is correct , we should find in the weakly coupled type i theory some non - perturbative objects that behave as massive particles in the spinor representation of @xmath2 .",

    "the lightest spinors of @xmath2 appear at the first massive level and their mass is @xmath228 at @xmath229 .",
    "as one increases the heterotic coupling constant , the mass @xmath41 gets renormalized , since there are no constraints on it coming from supersymmetry , and so , for a general value of @xmath230 , we can write @xmath231 where the function @xmath232 can in principle be computed in perturbation theory and is such that @xmath233 . by going to the type i theory and using the duality relations ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ dilaton ] ) , we can rewrite the mass @xmath41 as follows @xmath234 where @xmath235 .",
    "thus , contrarily to what happened for the tension of the d - string ( [ t2 ] ) , the mass @xmath41 of these stable non - bps states for @xmath236 is not simply the translation of the heterotic mass at @xmath229 , but differs from it by a factor of @xmath237 .",
    "of course , such a factor is not accessible to perturbation theory and must be determined using different methods .",
    "let us then examine more carefully the structure of these non - bps configurations . on the heterotic side they are simply excited states of the fundamental string ;",
    "thus , it is natural to expect that the d1 brane is involved on the type i side .",
    "however a single d1 brane can not reproduce the features of our non - bps states for several reasons .",
    "first of all , a d1 brane is a bps configuration ; moreover , as we have seen in the previous section , it is dual to a fundamental heterotic string with winding number 1 . on the contrary ,",
    "our non - bps configurations correspond to _ unwrapped _ strings , _",
    "i.e. _ to states that are not charged under the gravitational 2-form of the heterotic theory , and therefore they should be dual to type i configurations that are neutral under the r - r 2-form potential .",
    "the simplest system constructed out of d1 branes but without any r - r charge , is clearly the superposition of a d1 brane and an anti - d1 brane .",

    "] however , this configuration is _ unstable _ due to presence of a tachyonic mode arising from the open strings stretched between the brane and the anti - brane @xcite . to see this ,",
    "let us study the brane / anti - brane pair in more detail .",
    "when we put an anti - d1 brane on top of a d1 brane , we have four types of open strings :    * the 1 - 1 strings with both end - points on the d1 brane ; * the @xmath239-@xmath239 strings with both end - points on the anti - d1 brane ; * the 1-@xmath239 strings starting from the d1 brane and ending on the anti - d1 brane ; * the @xmath239 - 1 strings starting from the anti - d1 brane and ending on the d1 brane .",
    "as we have seen before , convenient way of encoding the information about the end - points of the open strings is by means of chan - paton factors . in the present case",
    "we can introduce @xmath240 chan - paton matrices @xmath241 as follows @xmath242 the 1-@xmath243 ( and @xmath243 - 1 ) strings differ in a crucial way from the 1 - 1 strings considered in section 2.2 because they are characterized by a `` wrong '' gso projection , which , for example , selects the tachyonic ground state and removes the massless vectors in the ns sector .",
    "this fact can be understood more easily by studying this same system from the closed string point of view , where the interactions are seen as a tree - level exchange of closed string states along a cylinder between the brane and the anti - brane . however , for the sake of clarity , we first analyze what happens in the more familiar case of a pair formed by two d - branes on top of each other .",
    "the interaction between them is computed by summing the contributions to the exchange energy of all closed string states and can be organized as a sum of the even closed string spin structures : ns - ns , ns - ns@xmath244 and r - r   never gives a contribution and thus will not be considered . ] .",
    "of course , this is completely equivalent to compute the one - loop vacuum energy of open strings stretched between the two d - branes , which is organized as a sum of the even open string spin structures : ns , ns@xmath244 and r. in fact , by means of a modular transformation @xmath245 , it is possible to map the length @xmath246 of the cylinder described by the closed strings , into the modular parameter of the annulus @xmath247 spanned by the open strings .",
    "then , using the modular properties of the jacobi @xmath248-functions that appear in the amplitude , one can explicitly check that under the above modular transformation the contribution coming from the exchange of r - r states is exactly mapped into the contribution of the ns@xmath244 sector of the 1 - 1 open strings ; in other words , the exchange of r - r states between two d1 branes gives the same result that one finds by computing the one - loop vacuum energy of the ns sector of the 1 - 1 open strings weighted with the gso operator @xmath244 .",
    "the correspondence between the closed string channel and the open string one can be established also for the other spin structures , and the results are summarized in the following table 0.5 cm @xmath249 0.6 cm in particular , we easily see that the sum of the ns - ns and r - r sectors of the closed string is equivalent to the ns sector of the open string with the usual gso projection .",
    "thus , the ns sector of the 1 - 1 and @xmath243-@xmath243 strings contains only states that are _ even _ under @xmath244 ; hence the tachyon ground state is not allowed .. ]    let us now consider an anti - d brane on top of a d brane",
    ". in this case , from the closed string point of view , the ns - ns and the ns - ns@xmath244 spin structures give exactly the same contributions as before , but the contribution of the r - r spin - structure changes sign , since it is proportional to the product of the r - r charges of the two branes . according to table ( [ table1 ] )",
    ", this fact implies that the contribution of the ns@xmath244 spin structure of the open channel changes sign , so that the ns sector of the open strings stretched between a brane and an anti - brane has the `` wrong '' gso projection .",
    "thus , the ns sector of the 1-@xmath239 and @xmath239 - 1 strings contains only states that are _ odd _ under @xmath244 ; in particular , the two tachyonic states @xmath250 with @xmath251 are permitted . in conclusion , we can say that the requirement that a cylinder diagram can be reinterpreted as an annulus diagram through a modular transformation fixes the type of gso projection that one has to perform on the various kinds of open strings stretched between two branes . since these are distinguished by the chan - paton factors ( see eqs .",
    "( [ 11])-([1b1 ] ) ) , it is natural to introduce a generalized gso projection to also take them into account . let us then define the operator @xmath252 that acts like the usual @xmath244 on the open string oscillators and ground states , and that acts on the chan - paton factors according to @xmath253 where @xmath254 are the pauli matrices .",
    "obviously , @xmath255 and @xmath256 are even under @xmath252 , while @xmath257 and @xmath258 are odd .",
    "thus , our previous findings can be summarized by saying that the spectrum of the open strings suspended between two d branes , or between a d brane and an anti - d brane , contains only states that are _ even _ under the extended gso operator @xmath252 .",
    "the considerations presented so far apply to any system formed by a brane and an anti - brane of type ii , and do not make any use of the twist operator @xmath8 .",
    "thus , one may wonder whether the presence of the tachyons ( [ ts ] ) in the d1/anti - d1 pair can be avoided by going to the type i theory .",
    "we can easily see , however , that this is not the case because the tachyon instability is not removed by the @xmath8 projection .",
    "in fact , the situation is similar to the one described in eq .",
    "( [ 19 - 91 ] ) because also here the orientation projection selects only a linear combination of the two tachyonic states ( [ ts ] ) . in particular ,",
    "since the oscillator content of the tachyons is even , the combination @xmath259 is projected out and only the symmetric combination of the chan - paton matrices survives , so that the tachyon in the type i theory is given by @xmath260    at this point , one has to understand whether the instability due to the existence of a tachyonic state in the spectrum is an incurable problem of the system , or is just a consequence of the fact that we are expanding the tachyon field @xmath261 around a false vacuum .",
    "of course , only in this second case one may hope that the d1/anti - d1 pair could form a bound state that has something to do with the perturbative heterotic state we are looking for . to give an answer to this question one should compute the tachyonic potential @xmath262 and see whether or not it has a minimum .",
    "unfortunately , our knowledge of this potential is very limited and thus only a qualitative analysis can be performed along these lines .",
    "let us nevertheless examine what can be said in this regard .",
    "first of all , from eq .",
    "( [ tachi ] ) it is easy to realize that @xmath262 is an even function of @xmath261 .",
    "in fact , let us suppose for a moment that @xmath262 contains a term like @xmath263 ; then from it one can construct a non - vanishing amplitude with an odd number of external tachyons which has to be reproduced by some non - vanishing string diagram .",
    "however , all open string amplitudes are multiplied by the trace of the chan - paton factors of the external states , which in our case is zero : indeed @xmath264=0 $ ] . therefore , only even powers of @xmath261 are allowed to appear in the tachyonic potential . are allowed .",
    "] another thing that is known about @xmath262 is that the coefficient of the @xmath265 term is positive @xcite so that it is conceivable to think that there exist a minimum for @xmath262 .",
    "we now assume that all higher order terms in the potential do not change the mexican - hat shape produced by the first two terms , and that @xmath262 has an absolute minimum for @xmath266 ( since the potential is an even function , the minima always come in pairs ) .    given these assumptions",
    ", we can pose the following question : if we allow the tachyon to roll down at the values @xmath267 and stabilize the system , is it possible that after tachyon condensation the d1/anti - d1 pair describes the type i d - particle we are looking for ?",
    "the answer to this question is no .",
    "in fact , as we have seen in the previous section , both the d1 and the anti - d1 branes of type i carry the quantum numbers of the spinorial representation of the gauge group , so that the resulting bound state can not be a spinor of @xmath2 , which instead is the distinctive feature of the particle we are searching . on the other hand",
    ", it is quite natural to expect that a brane - antibrane pair annihilates into the vacuum just like a particle - antiparticle pair may do .",
    "actually , this can happen only if the total energy of the system is vanishing ; in our particular case this condition means that the negative energy density of the tachyonic condensate has to exactly cancel the positive energy density of the two d - strings , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath268 where @xmath269 is the d1 brane tension given in eq .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) .",
    "we can rephrase the content of eq .",
    "( [ enecom ] ) by saying that when the tachyon condenses everywhere to @xmath267 the entire system stabilizes in a `` trivial '' way and reaches a configuration that is indistinguishable from the supersymmetric vacuum into which the d1 and anti - d1 branes have annihilated  . while this scenario seems quite reasonable at first sight , at a deeper analysis it looks too radical and surprising since it implies that the only stable configuration in which the tachyon can condense is the vacuum .",
    "luckily , as we shall see , there are other possibilities for tachyon condensation which lead to more interesting results .",
    "the basic problems with the d1/anti - d1 pair we have considered so far are that both branes are spinors of the gauge group and that the resulting system after tachyon condensation can have the same quantum numbers of the vacuum .",
    "however , we know from the previous section that there is a simple way to avoid this situation . in fact , by compactifying on a circle of radius @xmath163 the direction along which the d - strings extend and by switching on a @xmath6 wilson line , we can remove the zero - modes of the 1 - 9 strings and make the d1 brane a scalar of @xmath2 .",
    "hence , a pair formed by a d1 brane and an anti - d1 brane with a @xmath6 wilson line ( _ e.g. _ @xmath213 on the d1 brane and @xmath215 on the anti - d1 brane ) has the right quantum numbers to transform in the spinor representation of @xmath2 and is a good candidate to describe the type i particle . at first sight",
    ", it seems unlikely that the presence of a wilson line may change radically the fate of the d1/anti - d1 system ; in fact , a constant gauge field usually does not modify the energy density of a configuration because its field strength is vanishing .",
    "however , in our case , the situation is quite different : since our system as a whole transforms like a spinor of @xmath2 , the condensation of the tachyonic field can not restore the vacuum and a new stable configuration with non - zero energy can be realized .",
    "this is possible because the tachyonic state ( [ tachi ] ) has only one endpoint on the anti - d1 brane where @xmath215 so that the corresponding field @xmath261 is charged under the wilson line and feels the presence of a non vanishing @xmath248 .",
    "therefore , the tachyonic condensate is different from the one obtained for the system without wilson line and its contribution to the energy is not longer that of eq .",
    "( [ enecom ] ) .",
    "what is happening is that the constant gauge field changes the energy density of the system through the modifications it induces on the charged field @xmath261 which is present in the background . to see how this mechanism can work ,",
    "it is easier to perform the gauge transformation ( [ gt ] ) in order to `` switch off '' the wilson line and deal with a non - interacting system .",
    "we have already shown that in this gauge the wavefunction of an object with charge @xmath201 is no longer periodic , but according to eq .",
    "( [ wilsonline ] ) it acquires a phase @xmath270 each time it is translated around the wrapped anti - d1 brane . since in our case @xmath215 and @xmath207 , this simply means that the momentum @xmath205 of the state ( [ tachi ] ) is quantized in _ half - integer _",
    "multiples of @xmath185 so that the tachyonic field @xmath261 has the following mode expansion on the d - string world - sheet @xmath271 from this expression we immediately see that @xmath272 _ i.e. _ @xmath261 satisfies antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "the fact that a bosonic field is not periodic may seem strange ; however this should not come as a surprise since this is the behavior of any charged field in the presence of a wilson line , while only the neutral ( _ i.e. _ gauge invariant ) quantities remain periodic . because of eq .",
    "( [ tach124 ] ) , a system where @xmath261 is everywhere constant is no longer acceptable and this shows clearly that the tachyonic condensate gets modified by the presence of the @xmath6 wilson line . in fact , what becomes allowed by the new boundary conditions of @xmath261 is a configuration that interpolates between the two minima @xmath267 ; thus , in this case , the tachyonic condensate corresponds to a kink solution @xmath273 that passes from @xmath274 to @xmath275 as one goes around the compact dimension , namely @xmath276 of course , the energy of this configuration depends on the exact shape of the tachyonic kink @xmath273 for all values of @xmath146 and , according to our previous arguments , it contributes to the mass @xmath41 of the type i particle as follows @xmath277\\ ] ] since the kink solution is not explicitly known , we can not use this equation to evaluate @xmath41 ; however we can easily extract from it the behavior of @xmath41 for small values of the type i coupling constant @xmath278 .",
    "in fact , both the classical potential @xmath262 and the brane tension @xmath279 scale with the usual factor of @xmath280 since they originate from a string calculation on a disk .",
    "thus the mass @xmath41 of the non - bps particle is proportional to the inverse of the coupling constant , exactly as it happens for the supersymmetric d - particle of type iia theory . by using this information in eq .",
    "( [ mass1 ] ) , we can see that for @xmath236 the function @xmath281 is given by @xmath282 where @xmath283 is a constant . in order to fix its value",
    ", we have to leave the field theory analysis and systematically study the conformal field theory of the open strings living on the d1/anti - d1 system .",
    "this is what we are going to do in the next section .",
    "however , before concluding this section , we would like to present one more consideration at a qualitative level : if one insists that @xmath283 be a finite constant for all values of the radius @xmath163 , then @xmath284 has to be equal to @xmath267 almost everywhere and the core of the kink has to be concentrated in the @xmath146 direction around a point , say @xmath285 .",
    "these requirements ensure that the energy density in eq .",
    "( [ enecom2 ] ) is vanishing everywhere because of eq .",
    "( [ enecom ] ) , except around the position of the tachyonic soliton .",
    "thus one can interpret the energy of this system as the mass of a _",
    "localized _ particle .",
    "furthermore , the possibility to put the core of the kink in an arbitrary point @xmath285 corresponds to freedom that the particle has to move along the @xmath286 direction . in the following sections we will show that this stable non - bps particle of type i is actually a d - particle",
    ".    1.5 cm",
    "[ cr ] 0.5 cm so far we have not really exploited the presence of the compact direction around which the d - strings are wrapped and , in some sense , we have implicitly taken the @xmath287 limit . in this section ,",
    "on the other hand , we consider the d1/anti - d1 system at the particular radius @xmath288 and study the conformal field theory of the open strings living on its world - volume .",
    "in particular , following ref .",
    "@xcite we show that the non - bps configuration corresponding to a d1/anti - d1 bound state is a stable d - particle of type i. then , in the next section , we will consider the decompactification limit @xmath287 and show that this d - particle is stable even for @xmath289 .",
    "the critical radius @xmath290 is special for several reasons : first of all , the effective ( mass)@xmath291 of the scalar state ( [ tachi ] ) , which is tachyonic in the uncompactified space , is non - negative . in fact , from the constraint @xmath292 , we find that @xmath293 where we have taken into account that the momentum along @xmath286 is quantized in half - integer units of @xmath290 because of the presence of the @xmath6 wilson line ( see also eq .",
    "( [ tach123 ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , from eq .",
    "( [ masslesstach ] ) it is easy to see that the lightest excitations of @xmath261 are those with @xmath294 and @xmath295 and that , for these two values , @xmath296 is exactly zero .",

    "thus , the conformal field theory at @xmath290 possesses two marginal operators corresponding to these two massless scalar states , which , as we will see , play a crucial role in our discussion .",
    "a second peculiar feature of the critical radius ( [ critrad ] ) is that at @xmath290 the conformal field theory generated by the coordinates @xmath297 and @xmath178 admits several different representations .",
    "in fact , since a bosonic field @xmath298 compactified on a circle of radius @xmath290 and with neumann boundary conditions is equivalent to a couple of real ns fermions , the @xmath299 , @xmath300 system is equally well described by three fermions @xmath301 , @xmath302 and @xmath178 where @xmath301 and @xmath302 are defined by @xmath303 since the three fermions @xmath301 , @xmath302 and @xmath178 are on equal footing , we can use again the bosonization formulas in order to regroup the three fields in a different way and form a new boson .",

    "@xcite , it turns out that if one describes the system using @xmath138 and @xmath302 , it is possible to encode the tachyonic background explicitly in the conformal field theory . in order to see why this simplification occurs , let us focus on the two massless excitations of the `` tachyonic '' state ( [ tachi ] ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath307 and look at the explicit form of their vertex operators @xmath308 in the various representations . using the bosonization formulas ( [ bos])-([bos3 ] ) it is easy to see that @xmath309 ~~,\\ ] ] where for simplicity we have understood the superghost part and the chan - paton factor @xmath310 . from these relations we immediately realize that the states @xmath311 of eq .

    "this is a first hint to the fact that the `` tachyonic '' field associated to @xmath318 can be probably treated in the same manner of a gauge field .    as we have seen in section",

    "therefore , our working hypothesis is that , at the critical radius @xmath290 , the `` tachyonic '' background @xmath273 discussed in the previous section can be described by a wilson line of the `` gauge '' field @xmath319 associated to the state ( [ calt ] ) . in order to identify which is the bosonic coordinate related to @xmath302 and write the wilson line , it is sufficient to look at the vertex operator corresponding to @xmath318 in the @xmath152-superghost picture . in the original ( @xmath297 , @xmath178 ) description , we know @xcite that the picture changing operation transforms the `` tachyon '' vertex operators as follows @xmath320 then , by using the bosonization formulas ( [ bos ] ) and ( [ bos2 ] ) , we can easily obtain the @xmath321 , @xmath322 description of @xmath323 , and finally get @xmath324 this is identical to the vertex of the usual gauge boson at zero momentum , where @xmath138 plays the role of the coordinate @xmath298 . from this equation , it is clear that @xmath325 represents a marginal operator which can be used to modify the theory .",

    "this can be shown by means of the same approach used by j. polchinski in ref .",
    "@xcite to find the mass of the d - branes in type ii theories .",
    "one starts by computing the vacuum energy between two identical systems and then extracts the part corresponding to the exchange of closed strings in the ns - ns spin structure . in the limit of very large separation , only the massless states contribute and this string result , which depends only on @xmath465 and @xmath466 , has to be equal to the field theory answer which instead is given in terms of the mass @xmath41 and of the newton s constant @xmath137 . using this method",
    ", we now check that , in the absence of a @xmath319 background ( @xmath203 ) , the interaction between two d1/anti - d1 pairs give the expected answer .",
    "newton s law ( in ten dimension ) tells that the potential energy between two masses @xmath41 placed at a distance @xmath315 from each other scales as @xmath467 where the newton s constant is proportional to @xmath185 since one dimension ( @xmath297 ) is compactified . also the string result scales as @xmath468 ; in fact , the vacuum energy between two @xmath4-extended objects at a distance @xmath315 from each other is @xmath469 where @xmath470 is the world - volume of the @xmath4-brane . in our case @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath471 scales as @xmath163 .",
    "thus , by equating the @xmath163 dependence of eqs .",
    "( [ newlaw ] ) and ( [ ustring ] ) for @xmath17 , we find , as expected , that the mass of the system is proportional to the radius : @xmath472 . in the presence of the kink solution ( @xmath340 ) , the gravitational interaction is still described by eq .",
    "( [ newlaw ] ) , but the string computation is different .",
    "in fact , from eq .",
    "( [ mvr ] ) we know that the effective radius @xmath473 one should use in the conformal field theory analysis is the inverse of the physical radius @xmath163 along the @xmath297 direction .",
    "thus , for @xmath17 we get @xmath474 equating the @xmath163 behavior of eqs .",
    "( [ newlaw ] ) and ( [ ustring1 ] ) we now find that at @xmath340 the mass @xmath41 of the d1/ant - d1 pair is _ independent _ of @xmath163 .",
    "thus , the mass of the type i d - particle described by this system in the flat minkowski space is the same as the one computed at the critical radius , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath475 as we have seen in eq .",
    "( [ ormass ] ) .    in these notes",
    "we have mainly concentrated on the construction of the stable non - bps d - particle of type i which is predicted and required by the heterotic / type i duality .",
    "however , the techniques we have used and the strategy we have discussed can be generalized and applied to other systems and theories .",
    "even if the entire construction seems quite complicated and technically involved , the emerging picture is very satisfactory and appealing and makes manifest the fact that the presence of a tachyonic field in a string theory is not necessarily a sign of inconsistency .",
    "of course there are many issues and developments that have not been covered in these notes but which are very interesting , such as for example the construction of other stable non - bps d - branes of type i @xcite or the relation between the d - brane charge and k - theory @xcite . moreover , there are still some open problems which remain to be solved : among them we can mention the problem of understanding the mechanism of tachyon condensation directly at the level of the effective theory of the branes which in turn requires also a better understanding of the fate of the various gauge fields living on d - brane world volume @xcite .",
    "a progress in this direction presumably could help to understand the mechanism of tachyon condensation also in those cases where the tachyon appears in the closed string spectrum .",
    "0.5 cm it is a pleasure to thank p. di vecchia , m. frau , l. gallot , i. pesando .",
    "s. sciuto and p. strigazzi for many useful discussions , and the organizers and the participants of the school _ quantum aspects of gauge theories , supersymmetry and unification _ in leuven ( belgium ) january 1999 for their stimulating questions and observations .",
    "r. russo wishes also to thank a. bilal and d. matalliotakis for many valuable suggestions and observations .      in section [ cr ]",
    "we have extensively used the well known equivalence between a compact bosonic field and two real fermions .",
    "this equivalence is exploited in string theory in many contexts , but , even if the basic idea is always encoded by eq .",
    "( [ bos ] ) , there are some differences among various cases . for instance , the bosonization procedure relates the two formulations of heterotic theory mentioned in section [ pert ] ; however , in that case , the bosonic fields satisfied periodic boundary conditions and the critical radius was @xmath476 . on the other hand ,",
    "if neumann boundary conditions are imposed , the equivalence holds for @xmath477 .",
    "in fact , by looking at eq .",
    "( [ bos ] ) , it is clear that the first fermionic state one can construct by acting with @xmath478 on the vacuum corresponds , in the bosonic description , to a scalar state of momentum @xmath479 .",
    "since higher fermionic states are obtained by introducing other factors of @xmath480 , in the bosonic language one has to consider states whose momentum @xmath150 is @xmath481 with @xmath482 .",
    "further evidence that the two formulations really describe the same theory is provided by the computation of the partition function . in terms of the field",
    "@xmath297 , the partition function factorizes in a sum over the allowed momenta and in the oscillator contribution @xmath483 however , because of the particular form of the momentum , the sum take a very simple form and can be rewritten as a product @xmath484 and so eq .  ( [ pfbos ] ) can be recast in a different form @xmath485 that directly matches the partition function of two real ns fermions . however , this is not exactly the result we needed in section [ cr ] , where the bosonic field was compactified on a circle of radius @xmath486 and could have integer or half - integer values of the momentum according to various chan - paton factors ( but , of course not both together ) . if one looks at the states proportional to @xmath310 or @xmath328 , it is easy to realize that they simply are a subset of those that can be constructed when @xmath477 ; in particular their momentum is of the form @xmath487 .",
    "this consideration suggests that , at the critical radius we are interested in , the only bosonic states that can be constructed correspond to fermionic states with an _ odd _ number of @xmath301 and @xmath302 oscillators . on the other hand ,",
    "the states proportional to @xmath329 or@xmath336 are periodic : this implies that their momentum is integer in terms of @xmath290 and thus it can take only even values in terms of @xmath477 . in this case",
    "the corresponding fermionic states contain an _ even _ number of @xmath301 and @xmath302 oscillators .",
    "thus it turns out that the states with half - integer momentum of the bosonic field correspond to states with the usual gso projection in the fermionic language ; on the contrary , when the momentum is quantized in integer multiples of @xmath344 , one reproduces the sector with the `` wrong '' gso projection of the two real fermions .",
    "this can be checked again at the level of partition function .",
    "let us focus , for example , on the @xmath310 @xmath328 sector . here",
    "the sum over the allowed momenta in eq .",
    "( [ pfbos ] ) takes a slightly different form , but nevertheless it can be transformed in the expected partition function by using again the identity ( [ m1 ] ) @xmath488~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is possible to resume this result in a simple requirement , which also allows us to treat the states with different chan - paton factors in the same way .",
    "in fact , we can think that the momentum of the bosonic field @xmath297 is always allowed to assume both integer and half - integer values , but , then , we introduce a new discrete symmetry @xmath346 that selects physical states . from previous analysis ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath346 acts on @xmath301 and @xmath302 as a gso projection ; then from eqs .",
    "( [ bos2])-([bos3 ] ) one can derive how @xmath346 translates in terms of the rebosonized fields .",
    "for instance , by taking @xmath138 and @xmath302 as independent fields , it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ bos2 ] ) that @xmath346 transforms @xmath489 in @xmath490 .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath346 in the different languages is reported in table  [ hproj ] .",
    "of course , the boundary conditions of the new bosonic field @xmath138 depends on those of @xmath301 and @xmath317 .",
    "for instance , if both fermions are in the ns sector , it is sufficient to read eq .",
    "( [ pff ] ) backwards to see that @xmath138 is an usual neumann field",
    ". however , while @xmath301 is always a ns field , @xmath317 can also be in the r sector : in this case the combination of the two gives a bosonic field with dirichlet boundary conditions on one endpoint and neumann boundary conditions on the other .",
    "thus , @xmath138 is half - integer moded and can not carry momentum , thus its partition function is simply @xmath493 . the partition function in the fermionic description can be recast in this form showing again that the two representations are equivalent @xmath494 finally a useful observation is that the two discrete symmetries @xmath244 and @xmath346 can be combined so that the resulting transformation is much simpler in the @xmath321 , @xmath302 ) description",
    ".      since the physical states have to be even under both @xmath244 and @xmath346 separately , they are also even under @xmath496 and either @xmath244 or @xmath346 , and indeed the two requirements are equivalent ."
