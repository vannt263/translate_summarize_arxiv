    "functional renormalization group  @xcite ( frg ) has become a standard tool in condensed matter to treat interacting electron systems in two spatial dimensions such as hubbard models  @xcite or , more recently , spin systems  @xcite . despite its versatile applicability to a plethora of different problems",
    ", the approach always underlies the same principle : the frg first introduces an infrared frequency cutoff @xmath0 in the bare ( non - interacting ) propagator of the system .",
    "it then formulates differential equations for the evolution of the ( one - particle irreducible ) vertex functions under the flow of @xmath0 .",
    "the calculation is usually constrained to the single - particle and two - particle vertex .",
    "this way , the frg effectively sums up large classes of diagrammatic contributions in infinite order perturbation theory . if the flow of single - particle and two - particle vertices are jointly considered , the frg is even capable of going beyond the perturbative regime due to self - consistent diagrammatic resummation . at the beginning of the flow , typically defined at @xmath1 , the propagator",
    "is completely suppressed to zero and only the bare parameters in the hamiltonian ( i.e. , hopping amplitudes , interaction strengths , etc . ) enter the rg equations .",
    "hence , at @xmath1 the frg effectively starts from a free uv point of expansion . by lowering the cutoff @xmath0 ,",
    "the frg continuously includes interaction effects at the respective energy scale , treating the competition between different ordering tendencies on universal footing .",
    "symmetry breaking is then signaled by a breakdown of the flow at some scale @xmath2 , allowing to track the nature of the leading ordering instability .",
    "( certain formulations of frg further allow for expanding into the symmetry broken phase for special cases  @xcite . )    within frg , the uv point of expansion is usually of a trivial kind : for hubbard models formulated in momentum space , this corresponds to a cutoff beyond the bandwidth where no spectral weight exists such that the electrons are effectively non - interacting . for spin models described in the real space and frequency domain of pseudo - fermions , the point of expansion",
    "is the limit where all spins are independent from each other  @xcite .",
    "as the rg procedure sets in by decreasing @xmath0 , the spins start to correlate according to the ( in general ) local action of the hamiltonian and the correlations quickly extend over the full system . in this article",
    ", we generalize the frg point of expansion from decoupled single ( pseudo- ) fermions to decoupled clusters of particles .",
    "the inspiration for this stems from the established notion that any expansion series proves more accurate when the expansion point is located closer to the physical regime one intends to describe .",
    "stated differently , while the single particle expansion point does not contain any knowledge about the many - body correlation profile , the cluster frg incorporates correlations within the cluster already in the uv limit .",
    "while the specific implementation presented in the following is based on the pseudo - fermion frg ( pffrg ) scheme  @xcite designed for lattice spin models , our ansatz promises general application to different frg approaches such as designed for hubbard models .",
    "consider a spin hamiltonian on a lattice for which we perform the frg procedure in a real - space formulation . to begin with",
    ", we divide the lattice into small clusters , named @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , ... . each cluster @xmath6",
    "consists of lattice sites @xmath7 with @xmath8 . without loss of generality , consider an isotropic spin model of the form @xmath9 with spin operators @xmath10 defined on lattice sites @xmath7 and arbitrary interactions @xmath11 between sites @xmath7 and @xmath12 . such a cluster partitioning splits up the hamiltonian into two parts",
    ", @xmath13 the first part describes the intra - cluster couplings while the second part contains the inter - cluster couplings .",
    "introducing spin clusters appears most suggestive when the inter - cluster couplings are small compared to the intra - cluster couplings .",
    "we will see , however , that the cluster frg is still advantageous when the strength of the inter - cluster couplings is comparable to the intra - cluster couplings . to further simplify this illustration of our approach ,",
    "we specifically consider identical clusters which form a regular pattern . furthermore",
    ", we assume that the clusters are small enough such that in the isolated cluster limit ( i.e. , putting the inter - cluster couplings to zero ) the hamiltonian can be easily diagonalized .",
    "this way one can calculate the exact two - particle vertices , i.e. , the fully renormalized interactions , of an isolated cluster . _ as the fundamental difference as compared to conventional frg schemes , it is this exact two - particle vertex which enters the initial conditions of the frg flow equations at @xmath1 .",
    "_ consequently , already at the beginning of the rg flow , the scheme includes properties of the interacting system such that during the flow only interaction effects of inter - cluster couplings are integrated out .",
    "one therefore expects a particularly good performance in regimes of small inter - cluster couplings . in the limit where the inter - cluster coupling would eventually vanish , the method becomes exact .",
    "and inter - layer couplings @xmath14 .",
    "the spin clusters needed in our cluster frg are the vertical rungs between the layers . ]",
    "we apply the cluster frg to the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 heisenberg model on a bilayer square lattice ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bilayer ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath15 here , the spin operators carry two indices @xmath7 and @xmath16 , specifying the position within a plane , and the layer index , respectively .",
    "@xmath17 denotes a sum over nearest neighbor sites within a plane .",
    "the two - site rungs with interactions @xmath14 connecting the two layers form the spin clusters in our approach .",
    "the phase diagram of this system is well - established . as a function of the ratio @xmath18 ,",
    "the system is initially given by an exact product state of isolated rung dimers at @xmath19 .",
    "upon increasing @xmath20 , the dimer state first remains intact , but the finite @xmath21-couplings generate correlations between the dimers . at a critical value  @xcite @xmath22 these fluctuations",
    "destroy the dimerization , close the dimer gap , and induce antiferromagnetic order which persists in the whole range @xmath23 .",
    "originally motivated by double layers of high - t@xmath24 materials , the bilayer heisenberg model ( bhm ) has early on been identified as hosting a transition between a dimerized phase of rungs and an antiferromagnetically ordered phase which is not driven by conventional magnetic frustration but purely quantum fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the antiferromagnet to dimer transition in the bhm was speculated to help explaining the singlet formation as doping destroys the antiferromagnetic order in the cuprate mott insulator  @xcite .",
    "the absence of frustration combined with its rich phase diagram gave the bhm further conceptual importance as a reference model in numerical studies of classical 3d heisenberg - type transitions from dimer to magnetic order  @xcite .",
    "with no sign - problem affecting its applicability , the precise characterization of the phase diagram and the nature of the transition by sandvik and collaborators can be considered one of the prototypical demonstrations of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations  @xcite .",
    "from there , many approaches have used the qmc results on the bhm as a benchmark for their applicability , such as schwinger - boson gutzwiller - projection  @xcite , dimer expansions  @xcite , high - temperature and ising expansions  @xcite , guttwiller - projected bose gas  @xcite , bond - operator mean field  @xcite , and triplet - wave expansions  @xcite .",
    "we likewise intend to benchmark our cluster frg for the bhm against the established numerical evidence .",
    "note , that the bhm is a challenging problem for pffrg being the precursor of our cluster frg : while the pffrg is insensitive to the sign problem and hence can conveniently treat magnetically frustrated scenarios in general , the quantitative analysis of a transition from a zero - dimensional dimer product state to a two - dimensional magnetically ordered state is rather involved and usually necessitates full self - consistent resummation and minimal violation of ward identities in the diagrammatic summation  @xcite . as will be explained below , for any formulation of pffrg to hold it necessitates the appropriate interplay between different mean - field limits corresponding to all possible mean - field decouplings of the spin hamiltonian in pseudo - fermion language . in dimensions",
    "lower than two such as the effectively zero - dimensional spin clusters considered here , however , certain mean - field limits are ill - defined .",
    "this becomes most obvious in the ordinary spin mean field channel ( corresponding to the rpa channel in pseudo - fermion language ) which always tends to overestimate magnetic order in spatial dimensions lower than two . as a result ,",
    "perturbative pffrg expects the transition between the dimerized and the antiferromagnetic phase already at rather small @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic susceptibility is not correctly reproduced in the dimer limit . in contrast , the cluster frg which we develop below stays numerically efficient , retains all the advantages of pffrg , and overcomes the aforementioned problems . by using the exact dimer vertex instead of the bare couplings in the initial conditions of the rg flow",
    ", we correctly resolve the dimerized phase and calculate the susceptibility and magnon dispersion therein .",
    "as @xmath20 increases , we observe a closing of the dimer gap and the appearance of a goldstone mode at a @xmath26 closer to the qmc reference result , signaling a clear improvement as compared to the conventional pffrg .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ method ]",
    "we develop the cluster frg in detail , considering a general spin model setup .",
    "we start with a short review of pffrg followed by the modified initial rg conditions which constitute the core improvement in cluster frg .",
    "the readers who are interested in the complete implementation of the cluster frg including all technicalities are referred to the appendices  [ suppression]-[modifications ] . as explained in detail ,",
    "the diagrammatic summation in the cluster frg has to be corrected by counter terms due to over - counting of certain diagrams .",
    "section  [ application ] summarizes the application of our cluster frg scheme to the bilayer heisenberg model .",
    "we are able to accurately compute static and dynamic magnetic properties of the dimerized phase and find an improved correspondence of @xmath26 with the qmc result .",
    "we conclude in section  [ discussion ] that cluster frg sets the stage of extending existing frg schemes by promoting the uv expansion point to a product state which already incorporates many - body correlations",
    ". this concept might inspire improved frg schemes in different areas of interacting many - body systems .",
    "in this section we develop the spin cluster frg for general spin systems as given in eq .",
    "( [ ham_general ] ) . since some knowledge about the pffrg",
    "as the preceding approach is needed in the following , we start with a brief introduction of this method .      within pffrg",

    "( [ ham_general ] ) leads to a fermionic model with only quartic terms that can be treated using standard feynman many - body techniques including frg .",
    "since a kinetic hopping term is missing in the fermionic model , the bare propagator in matsubara space is simply given by @xmath32 .",
    "most importantly , the absence of a hopping term restricts the fermions to be local , i.e. , each fermion propagator is defined on a particular lattice site .",
    "@xcite the introduction of pseudo - fermions comes along with an artificial enlargement of the hilbert space and , therefore , requires the fulfillment of an occupancy constraint ( exclusion of empty and doubly occupied states ) .",
    "however , since an unphysical occupation acts as a vacancy in the spin lattice associated with an excitation energy of order @xmath33 , particle number fluctuations are suppressed at zero temperature , and the constraint is already fulfilled by correctly adjusting the chemical potential of the fermions @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite due to particle - hole symmetry , @xmath34 turns out to vanish , @xmath35 .",
    "the fundamental step in the frg procedure is the introduction of an infrared frequency cutoff @xmath0 in the bare propagator , replacing @xmath36 .",

    "@xcite we note that in principle , in analogy to the pffrg ,  @xcite the spin cluster frg can also be formulated using the katanin truncation scheme  @xcite .",
    "such a truncation keeps certain three - particle contributions and therefore leads to a self - consistent treatment of different interaction channels . an extension of this kind",

    "this would complicate a numerical solution enormously .",
    "one seemingly simple way to resolve this problem is to reformulate the cluster - frg equations using the _ non - amputated _ exact two - particle vertex @xmath318 , @xmath319 similarly , external propagators are also attached to the vertices @xmath291 : new vertices @xmath320 are obtained multiplying @xmath291 by an extra factor @xmath321 for each pair of variables @xmath209 with @xmath211 which cancels the poles . since the additional propagators @xmath322 are @xmath0-independent , the cluster - frg equations can be easily rewritten in terms of @xmath323 and @xmath324 .",
    "such a scheme , however , still exhibits two severe problems .",
    "firstly , the vertices @xmath291 as defined in eqs .",
    "( [ gamma1])-([gamma10 ] ) only indicate _",
    "pairs _ of external legs which are directly connected to the same exact two - particle vertex",
    ". however , a vertex @xmath294 can still contain an internal exact dimer vertex @xmath113 which only exhibits _",

    "connecting two exact dimer vertices  results in a pole @xmath327 , see eq .",
    "( [ modify_example2 ] ) .",
    "the red shaded area highlights the internal one - particle reducible three - particle dimer vertex ( see also right side ) which is responsible for the pole . ]    secondly , additional poles in the flow equations can now occur in the internal propagators @xmath103 . to see this ,",
    "let us consider a particular term in the particle - particle channel contributing to the flow of @xmath328 , @xmath329 see fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster_frg_modify ] left . with @xmath330 the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ modify_example ] ) can be rewritten in terms of @xmath320 , yielding @xmath331 since the internal propagator labelled  3 \" connects two exact dimer vertices ( see fig .  [ fig : cluster_frg_modify ] left ) , there remains a factor @xmath332 in eq .",
    "( [ modify_example2 ] ) .",
    "even though the resulting pole @xmath333 is regularized by a @xmath334-function , this term leads to unstable numerics at small @xmath0-scales .",
    "as @xmath335 , the internal @xmath336-integration yields the principle value of the pole . a numerical implementation of the cluster frg reproducing the correct principle value , however , turns out to be challenging .",
    "the occurrence of divergences in such diagrams is tied to the fact that the term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ modify_example ] ) contains a one - particle reducible three - particle dimer vertex , as indicated by the red shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster_frg_modify ] ( see also the diagram on the right of fig .  [",
    "fig : cluster_frg_modify ] ) .",
    "generally , such a three - particle vertex is an allowed term which does not over - count any diagrams .",
    "however , as argued above , it exhibits a pole in the internal propagator  3 \" .    in order to overcome these problems ,",
    "we propose a modified and numerically more stable scheme in which the diagram on the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster_frg_modify ] is not generated during the rg flow .",
    "in other words , we need to suppress any term in the flow equations where two exact dimer vertices are directly connected by an internal propagator  3 \" or  4 \" .",
    "while such a scheme represents an approximation of the original cluster - frg equations , the dimer limit is still exactly reproduced .",
    "all results presented in section  [ results ] have been obtained within this modified scheme .    a suppression of the one - particle reducible three - particle vertex shown in fig .  [ fig : cluster_frg_modify ] ( right )",
    "can be achieved by introducing a new set of vertices @xmath337 , @xmath338 , different from @xmath291 and @xmath339 . for the definition of @xmath340 we use the following convention : given an arbitrary two - particle vertex @xmath291 ,",
    "we call an external leg @xmath176 with @xmath326 a  dimer leg \" , if there exists an internal exact dimer vertex which shares the same leg @xmath176 ( i.e. , which exhibits the variable @xmath176 among its arguments ) . for example , the graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : frg_example](b ) , has two dimer legs labelled  1 \" and  2 \" .",
    "obviously , each of the four external legs of a two - particle vertex can either be a dimer leg or not , resulting in @xmath341 different combinations .",
    "note that in amputated vertices a dimer leg @xmath176 leads to a pole @xmath342 .",
    "the new set of vertices @xmath337 corresponds to the 16 combinations where we additionally attach propagators @xmath343 to each dimer leg to cancel the poles .",
    "in contrast to @xmath291 these vertices do not specify _ pairs _ of legs which are connected to the same exact dimer vertex but indicate the connection to an exact dimer vertex for each leg separately . in analogy to the scheme presented in appendix  [ suppression ] , the frg equations can be decomposed into equations for @xmath340",
    ". we again introduce counter terms which contain all contributions where the internal propagators  3 \" or  4 \" ( or both ) connect two dimer legs .",
    "most importantly , this cancels all forbidden diagrams _ and _ one - particle reducible three - particle vertices of the form of fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster_frg_modify ] and therefore leads to a numerically stable cluster frg scheme .",
    "one might expect that the evaluation of the corresponding rg equations requires considerable numerical efforts because 16 vertex functions ( where each one is separately parametrized in frequency space , real space and spin space ) need to be calculated .",
    "however , several symmetries under mutual permutations of the external variables @xmath296 , @xmath297 , @xmath298 , @xmath299 can be exploited , which relate the vertices @xmath340 among each other .",
    "it turns out that only six independent vertices need to be calculated .",
    "moreover , since the katanin scheme is not needed in parameter regimes close to ( or at least not too far away from ) the isolated cluster limit , the numerics are still running faster as compared to the conventional pffrg approach ."
