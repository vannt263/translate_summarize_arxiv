    "it is of the utmost interest to explore the `` terra incognita '' of exotic nuclei , as evidenced by the fact that several radioactive ion beam ( rib ) facilities are being upgraded , under construction or planned to be constructed worldwide .",
    "such investigations of the properties of these exotic nuclei , which may behave very differently from the nuclei around the @xmath2-stability line , result in new discoveries such as the halo phenomenon  @xcite - nucleons spread like a thin mist around the nucleus , which can significantly increase the nuclear reaction ratio .",
    "stellar nucleosynthesis processes such as the @xmath0-process  @xcite , which is responsible for roughly half of the enrichment of elements heavier than iron in the universe , also require a thorough understanding of the properties of exotic nuclei .",
    "key properties like masses for example , determine the path that the nucleosynthesis process follow in the nuclei chart . nevertheless , despite many experimental efforts , present knowledge of exotic nuclei still does not include much of what is required for a complete understanding of @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "after the first systematic introduction to the @xmath0-process  @xcite half a century ago , @xmath0-process calculations for a long time could only rely on the phenomenological nuclear droplet mass formula  @xcite because of the lag of both experimental and theoretical development .",
    "fortunately , in the last 15 year the theoretical study of nuclear properties has made tremendous progress and @xmath0-process calculations  @xcite have been carried out based on the refined droplet model frdm  @xcite , hartree - fock approach like etfsi - q  @xcite , and the very recent microscopic rooted hartree - fock bogliubov ( hfb )  @xcite .    despite the progress in the theoretical nuclear structure physics , mass models predictions ( which by design concentrate on different nuclear structure aspects ) still show a large deviation when going to very neutron - rich nuclides , even though they have achieved similar quality to describe known nuclides .",
    "this is specially troublesome since the astrophysical scenario in which an @xmath0-process may occur is a matter of debate and all astrophysical simulations dedicated to the nature of the stellar environment depend on the input from nuclear physics .",
    "mass model predictions , even in models that give similar global @xmath3 error still show local deviations differently .    in principle , microscopic - rooted mass models should have a more reliable extrapolation to the unknown regions , therefore these studies have received more and more interest as evidenced by the increasing number of non - relativistic hfb investigations  @xcite . based on a mass - driven fitted method ,",
    "the latest hfb models have achieved a similar quality ( @xmath4 0.7 mev ) as the phenomenological frdm mass model for known masses .",
    "more recently , another microscopic - rooted approach , the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory  @xcite has received broad attention due to its successful description of several nuclear phenomena during the past years ( for recent reviews , refer to refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the framework of the rmf theory ,",
    "the nucleons interact via the exchanges of mesons and photons .",
    "the corresponding large scalar and vector fields , of the order of a few hundred mev , provide simple and efficient descriptions of several important phenomena such as the large spin - orbit splitting , the density dependence of optical potential , the observation of approximate pseudo - spin symmetry , etc .. moreover , the rmf theory can reproduce well the isotopic shifts in the pb region  @xcite , explain naturally the origin of the pseudo - spin symmetry  @xcite as a relativistic symmetry  @xcite and spin symmetry in the anti - nucleon spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the first rmf mass table was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for 2174 even - even nuclei with @xmath5 but without including pairing correlations .",
    "later on , the calculation was improved by adopting a constant - gap bcs method and calculated 1200 even - even nuclei with @xmath6  @xcite , most of which are close to the @xmath2-stability line .",
    "more recently , using the state - dependent bcs method with a @xmath7-force  @xcite , the first systematic study of the ground state properties of over 7000 nuclei ranging from the proton drip line to the neutron drip line was performed @xcite .",

    "considering the recent development of the microscopic mass models in both the hfb and rmf approach , it is very interesting to examine their applicability to an @xmath0-process calculation .",
    "the main goals of this paper is to explore to what extent the solar @xmath0-process abundance can be reproduced using the new rmf mass table  @xcite and by comparing with other theoretical mass models , to determine the influence of nuclear mass uncertainty in @xmath0-process calculations .",

    "[ sec : rmf ] the global agreement of the new rmf mass table with the experimental data is discussed and the rmf prediction in the very neutron - rich range is compared with the frdm  @xcite , the etfsi - q  @xcite and the latest hfb-13  @xcite mass tables . in sec .",

    "finally the summary and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "with about 10 parameters fitted to the ground - state properties of around 10 spherical nuclei , the rmf approach with the tma parameter set is found to give a satisfactory description for all the nuclei in the nuclear chart .",
    "the model deviation of one - neutron separation energy @xmath8 with respect to the known experimental data can be characterized by the @xmath3 deviation ( @xmath9 ) @xmath10 although a relatively large @xmath3 deviation for the absolute mass value is found for the rmf calculation in comparison with the frdm and hfb-13 models , the finite differences in binding energies such as the practical used one - neutron separation energies @xmath8 are well predicted due to the cancelation of systematic error @xcite .",

    "the comparisons include nuclei with @xmath11 . comparing the predictions of the rmf model to the known values  @xcite results in discrepancies between -1.4 mev to 1 mev , while the difference between either the frdm or the hfb-13 and the experimental data is in the range of -1.3 mev to 0.5 mev .",
    "it shows that the microscopic model such as the rmf approach can almost achieve the same level of accuracy for known one - neutron separation energy @xmath8 as the phenomenological frdm . for each isobaric chain with mass @xmath12 ,",

    "while the macroscopic - microscopic mass model frdm shows the best agreement with experimental values in the neutron deficient mass region , it gets progressively worse when moving away from the stability line towards the neutron - rich side .",
    "all theoretical models addressing nuclei far away from the @xmath2-stability line involve a dramatic extrapolation to unknown nuclei .",
    "thus it is interesting to examine what is the difference of @xmath8 predicted in the different models when going towards the neutron - rich side . in fig .",

    "furthermore , the @xmath8 value is consistent with that in the hfb-13 model in the range of -0.5 mev to 0.5 mev when going to the unknown region of the nuclei chart .",
    "these differences indicates that the extrapolation can be quite different depending on the underlying physics of the model .",
    "similar conclusion can be drawn also for the comparison of the rmf and frdm models . around the @xmath19 shell ,",
    "the rmf model predicts a systematic lower @xmath8 .",
    "these different @xmath8 predictions towards the neutron drip line affect @xmath0-process calculations and thus the corresponding determined astrophysical conditions .",

    "for instance , one can think of it as the  onion \" structure of neutron sources with different densities , where the seed - nuclei capture neutrons while moving through different zones with different thicknesses . in this paper",
    "we explore for the first time the application of the new rmf mass model to an @xmath0-process calculation and at the same time investigate the effect of nuclear physics uncertainty in the @xmath0-process .    due to the high neutron densities , neutron captures are much faster than the competing @xmath2-decays and an ( n,@xmath39)@xmath40(@xmath39,n ) equilibrium",

    "it is possible that some of the discrepancies in the reproduction of the low mass abundances may be due to an additional nucleosynthesis component creating some of those abundances .",

    "since it is not possible to do a complete study of the shell - quenching effect at the single particle level which should affect more nuclei than the one with @xmath19 , we only study the effect of a reduced shell closure by artificially decreasing the shell gap energies at @xmath19 in the rmf and frdm models by 2 mev and 1 mev , respectively .",

    "[ fig : best](c ) shows that the trough is almost completely filled in by lowering the separation energies of @xmath83pm and @xmath84sm by 1 mev .",

    "this nuclear physical uncertainty is very important for the complete understanding of the @xmath0-process since the results of more modern full dynamic @xmath0-process calculations depend on the nuclear mass input used .",
    "it is found that the deduced astrophysical conditions like the neutron irradiation time of the @xmath0-process can be significantly different depending on the mass model used . among the different models , the simulation using the rmf masses requires a longer time scale ( up to a factor of 4 ) than those using frdm and hfb-13 models .",
    "furthermore , it is found that the optimal astrophysical conditions obtained using the etfsi - q and rmf mass models require a relatively constant weighting factor for neutron densities in the range @xmath88 to @xmath34 @xmath35 , while the frdm and hfb-13 simulations favor a large weighting factor at low densities .",
    "in addition , we have explored the possible deficiencies in different mass models , and found that the observed abundance underproduction before the abundance peaks in all the models can be a combined and complex effect of both shell structure and shape transition .",
    "an exception is the underproduction at @xmath89 in the hfb-13 model which can be attributed to incorrect @xmath2-decay rates .",
