    "the search for evidence of the origin of galactic cosmic rays has been an active area of research for many decades . while little evidence exists about the sites at which very high energy  nuclei are accelerated ,",
    "the results of recent x - ray and gamma - ray observations indicate that at least some of the cosmic - ray electrons are accelerated in the shocks of supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "for example , sn  1006  is one remnant for which there is evidence that cosmic - ray electrons have been accelerated to energies as high as about 100  tev @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "measurements of the x - ray and radio emission of the remnant are used to determine the parameters of the nonthermal electron spectrum .",
    "although there is no evidence to indicate that cosmic - ray nuclei are accelerated in sn  1006 , relativistic electrons and nuclei are expected to be accelerated in a similar manner @xcite .",
    "therefore , we estimate the parameters of the proton and helium spectra of the remnant . the results of this analysis show that the remnant is a significant source of galactic cosmic rays ( at least cosmic - ray electrons ) and provide some support for the idea that galactic cosmic rays are accelerated predominantly in the shocks of supernova remnants .",
    "section  [ obs ] contains a description of some of the results of previous analyses of the x - ray data of sn  1006 .",
    "the data and analysis techniques used for the present work are described in section  [ dat ] .",
    "section  [ dis ] includes a discussion of the results of the present analysis .",
    "the conclusions are reviewed in section  [ con ] .",
    "the first detection of x - ray emission from sn  1006  was reported by @xcite .",
    "the results of analyses of x - ray spectral data of the remnant have been reported by many authors @xcite . as early as 1979 , it was realized that the global x - ray spectrum of sn  1006  can not be fitted with a single thermal or nonthermal model @xcite .",
    "this realization is not surprising in retrospect because observations of the remnant with imaging x - ray devices show that the x - ray spectrum varies as a function of position in the remnant .",
    "the high - energy x - ray image of the remnant , like the radio image , is dominated by emission from the northeastern and southwestern rims @xcite .",
    "since the spectra of the rims are more or less featureless , the emission from these regions is reported to be nonthermal @xcite . at energies of less than 0.5  kev ,",
    "a significant amount of emission is observed from the interior of the remnant , especially in the southwest @xcite . since the x - ray spectrum of the interior exhibits atomic emission - line features ,",
    "a substantial amount of the emission from this region must be thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "several of the spectral analyses of sn  1006  included two spectral components .",
    "invariably , one of the spectral components is thermal emission from an optically thin plasma .",
    "such a model is needed to describe the emission - line features of oxygen , neon , magnesium , silicon , and perhaps iron @xcite .",
    "some analyses have included an additional thermal component , while others have included a nonthermal component .",
    "for example , hamilton et  al .",
    "( 1986 ) modeled the spectrum using two thermal components .",
    "one component is used to describe the forward - shocked interstellar medium , and the other describes the reverse - shocked ejecta . to explain the nearly featureless nature of the global x - ray spectrum of the remnant",
    ", they used a model for the shocked ejecta in which most of the emission is produced by a nearly pure layer of fully ionized carbon .",
    "the elements more massive than carbon are assumed to be significantly underionized in the ejecta , to suppress the x - ray line emission that would otherwise be produced by these elements",
    ". however , these assumptions are inconsistent with the results of subsequent analyses .",
    "the results of an analysis of the ultraviolet absorption - line features along the line of sight to the s - m star suggest that most of the ejected silicon has already been shocked @xcite , and therefore may not be in a low ionization state .",
    "this result is supported by x - ray observations that reveal line emission from several highly ionized elements : oxygen , neon , magnesium , silicon , and perhaps iron @xcite .",
    "since the relative abundance of the shocked silicon producing the x - ray emission is much larger than the relative abundance of silicon in the solar system , most of the shocked silicon is ejecta .",
    "furthermore , the results of the analysis of @xcite suggest that the total amount of reverse - shocked carbon required by the model of hamilton et  al .  may be unreasonably large for the remnant of a type ia supernova ( i.e. , may be well in excess of the chandrasekhar mass ) .",
    "for these reasons , the thermal model of hamilton et  al .  provides a poor description of the x - ray emission of sn  1006 .",
    "@xcite present a nonthermal interpretation of the high - energy x - ray emission .",
    "they argue that the x - ray emission from the rims is produced by relativistic electrons that are beamed from an unobserved central compact object .",
    "this conclusion seems to be based largely on the x - ray morphology of sn  1006 , because no evidence of a compact object or of particle jets in the remnant has been reported . for comparison ,",
    "the pulsar and the pulsar jet of the vela supernova remnant are observed to produce radio , x - ray , and gamma - ray emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite set an upper limit on the flux of a point source of @xmath9  erg  @xmath10  s@xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding constraint on the blackbody temperature of a 10  km neutron star is @xmath12  k ( at a distance of 1.7  kpc ) .",
    "some of the models of cooling neutron stars indicate that the temperature of a neutron star is higher than this upper limit at an age of 990  yr @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the sketchy record of the optical light curve of the supernova @xcite , the lack of evidence of an ob association near sn  1006  ( hamilton et  al .",
    "1986 ) , the large distance of the remnant from the plane of the galaxy [ @xmath13  pc ] , measurements of the average expansion rate of the remnant @xcite , and measurements of the relative abundances of the elements producing the ultraviolet absorption lines @xcite suggest that sn  1006  was produced by a type ia supernova .",
    "type ia supernovae are generally not expected to produce compact objects . for these reasons",
    ", it seems unlikely that sn  1006  contains an undetected compact object that is responsible for the high - energy x - ray emission from the rims .",
    "@xcite advance an alternative nonthermal explanation of the high - energy x - ray emission .",
    "they conclude that the emission from the rims is synchrotron radiation from electrons that have been accelerated to energies of about 100  tev .",
    "@xcite argues convincingly that this conclusion is the only plausible one and shows that the nonthermal x - ray emission of the rims can be described by a model in which both the radio and x - ray emission are produced by a common population of shock - accelerated electrons .",
    "the strong correlation of the features of a high - energy x - ray image and a radio image of the northeastern rim of sn  1006  @xcite supports this result .",
    "furthermore , the detection of inverse - compton tev gamma - ray emission from the northeastern rim of the remnant confirms the presence of very high energy  electrons in sn  1006  @xcite .",
    "since the tev photons are produced by electrons that have energies similar to the energies needed to produce x - ray synchrotron radiation and since the radio , x - ray , and gamma - ray spectral data can be fitted with simple models of the spectrum of shock - accelerated electrons @xcite , the conclusion that the nonthermal x - ray emission is produced by synchrotron radiation seems unavoidable .",
    "to accurately model the shape of the entire x - ray spectrum of sn  1006 , from 0.12 to 17  kev , we analyzed data obtained using the proportional counter array ( pca ) of the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) satellite , the solid - state imaging spectrometers ( siss ) of the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ ( _ asca _ ) , and the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspcb , hereafter just pspc ) of the _ rntgen _ satellite ( _ rosat _ ) . between 1996",
    "february 18 and 1996 february 20 , sn  1006   was observed for 21  ks at a location on the northeastern rim ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) and for 20  ks at a location on the southwestern rim ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) using the pca .",
    "the pca is a spectrophotometer that is comprised of an array of five coaligned proportional counter units that are mechanically collimated to have a field of view of @xmath18  fwhm @xcite .",
    "the array is sensitive to photons that have energies between about 2 and 60  kev and has an energy resolution @xmath19 at 6  kev .",
    "the maximum on - axis collecting area is about 7000  @xmath20 .",
    "the pca data were screened to remove the time intervals during which ( 1 ) one or more of the five proportional counter units is off , ( 2 ) sn  1006  is less than @xmath21 above the limb of the earth , ( 3 ) the background model is not well defined , and ( 4 ) the pointing direction of the detectors is more than @xmath22 from the nominal pointing direction in either right ascension or declination .",
    "the set of x - ray events that satisfies these four selection criteria includes 7  ks of the data of the northeastern pointing and 11  ks of the data of the southwestern pointing .",
    "spectra were constructed for each of the two pca pointings .",
    "the two spectra are quite similar because the field of view of the pca is large enough to include the entire remnant at both pointing locations .",
    "therefore , the pca data are insensitive to modest changes in the shape of the spectrum of the remnant as a function of position in the remnant .",
    "the pca background spectrum for sn  1006  was estimated using version 1.5 of the ftool _",
    "pcabackest_. this version of _ pcabackest _ includes an estimate of the charged - particle and diffuse cosmic x - ray backgrounds based on the `` vle '' count rate during observations of `` source - free '' regions of the sky and an estimate of the background associated with the decay of radioactive material that is activated when the spacecraft passes through the south atlantic anomaly .",
    "the tool has been found to produce slightly inaccurate estimates of the background associated with astrophysical sources .",
    "for example , when the background spectrum is subtracted from the spectral data of sn  1006 , the resulting `` source '' spectrum of the remnant has a negative count rate at high energies . to compensate for this problem ,",
    "the spectrum of the background associated with the south atlantic anomaly is multiplied by a factor of 0.2 .",
    "this factor is determined by requiring the average difference between the source spectrum and the source model to be zero at energies between 27 and 71  kev . in this energy band",
    ", the total number of events associated with sn  1006  is expected to be negligibly small compared to the number of events associated with the background .",
    "the adjustment reduces the count rate of the 210  kev activation background from 1.0 to 0.2  counts  s@xmath11 for the top layer of anodes in the pca . after applying this adjustment ,",
    "the average 210  kev background count - rate for the top layer is estimated to be @xmath23  counts  s@xmath11 for both pointings .",

    "the fitted relative abundance of silicon ( and sulphur and calcium ) is 1018 times larger than the solar abundance of silicon .",
    "the uncertainties of the abundances are somewhat larger than the statistical uncertainties specified in table  [ tab2 ] because ( hamilton et  al .  1983 ) note that the intensities used in the nei model for the strong emission lines are generally uncertain by at least a factor of 2 .",

    "only one thermal emission model is used in the present analysis to describe the properties of the x - ray  emitting material in sn  1006 .",
    "the use of one thermal component is undoubtedly an oversimplification , because both the forward - shocked interstellar material and the reverse - shocked ejecta produce x rays .",

    "yet the inferred amount of swept - up mass implies that most of the shocked mass is interstellar . for these reasons ,",
    "the use of a single thermal model to describe the global thermal emission properties of the remnant may provide a poor description of any given volume element of the x - ray  emitting material . nevertheless , the use of a single thermal model is sufficient to accurately characterize the properties of the nonthermal x - ray emission ( our primary goal ) , because the x - ray emission of the remnant is dominated by nonthermal emission at energies above 1  kev , because the results for the broken power law component are insensitive to the details of the single thermal component used in the fits ( compare the results obtained for the broken power laws of the `` bpl@xmath49nei '' and `` bpl@xmath49rs '' models listed in table 1 ) , and because @xcite and @xcite report no evidence of spatial variation of the thermal x - ray spectrum of the interior of sn  1006 .",

    "otherwise , the reverse - shocked electrons may be too cool to produce much x - ray emission .",
