    "with the running and upcoming experiments at lhc , rhic and gsi the analysis of the qcd phase diagram has become an important focus of research .",
    "not only the transition curves which separate different phases are of interest , but one would also like to understand from first principles the physical mechanisms that drive the various transitions .",
    "in this project we probe the finite temperature transition of qcd using static quark sources . in the framework of lattice qcd",
    "these can be implemented using local polyakov loops .",
    "the local polyakov loop @xmath1 is given by the trace of the product of temporal gauge links @xmath2 at a fixed spatial position @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the number of lattice points in time direction ) : @xmath5 i.e. , the polyakov loop is a gauge transporter that propagates a static quark at position @xmath3 forward in time . for later use",
    "we also define the spatially averaged polyakov loop @xmath6 as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the spatial volume . due to translation invariance @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath1 have the same vacuum expectation value .",
    "after suitable renormalization the polyakov loop may be related to the free energy @xmath9 of a single quark , i.e. , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the temperature .",
    "below @xmath12 the free energy is infinite , thus @xmath13 , and the quarks are confined . above @xmath12",
    "we have a finite free energy and thus @xmath14 , signaling deconfinement .",
    "hence the polyakov loop acts as an order parameter for deconfinement .    in the deconfined phase of pure su(3 )",
    "gauge theory the phases of the summed polyakov loops @xmath6 assume values in the vicinity of the three center elements @xmath15 of su(3 ) .",
    "this behavior shows the underlying center symmetry , a symmetry of the action and the path integral measure , which in pure gauge theory becomes broken spontaneously above @xmath12 .",
    "the polyakov loop @xmath6 transforms non - trivially under the center transformation and thus is also an order parameter for the symmetry breaking . above @xmath12 the polyakov loop",
    "@xmath16 is non - vanishing with phases near @xmath15 . for full",
    "qcd the fermion determinant breaks the center symmetry explicitly and acts as an external magnetic field favoring the real sector .    except for the interchange of low and high temperature",
    "the situation is equivalent to simple spin systems with spins @xmath17 . without external field",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian has a symmetry which may be broken spontaneously .",
    "the symmetry breaking can be analyzed with observables that transform non - trivially under the symmetry group , e.g. , the magnetization @xmath18 . to obtain the equivalence between the spin system and the gauge theory one",
    "has to identify the local loops @xmath1 with the spins @xmath17 and the spatially averaged polyakov loop @xmath6 with the magnetization @xmath19 . in the absence of an external field ( the fermion determinant ) the phase of the magnetization @xmath20 ( the spatially averaged polyakov loop @xmath16 ) spontaneously selects one of the phases according to the underlying symmetry .",
    "if the external field ( the fermion determinant ) is turned on , the previously sharp transition becomes a crossover , and the phase of the magnetization ( the polyakov loop ) is determined by the symmetry breaking term .    for the case of pure gauge theory",
    "these arguments are the basis of the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture @xcite which states that at @xmath12 pure su(3 ) gauge theory in 4 space - time dimensions can be described by a 3-d effective spin system with an effective action which is symmetric under the center group @xmath21 .",
    "the spin degrees of freedom are related to the local loops @xmath1 .",

    "the effective spins @xmath17 have values @xmath26 .",
    "magnetic finite temperature transitions for spin systems are well understood phenomena . for discrete symmetry groups",
    "the transition is accompanied by the formation of locally spin coherent weiss domains near @xmath12 , before one spin orientation wins out in the symmetry broken phase .",
    "even if a modest external magnetic field is applied one can still observe local clusters of aligned spins different from the direction preferred by the magnetic field .",
    "one can go a step further and analyze the connectedness properties of the weiss domains .",
    "one may define clusters of aligned spins and switch to a cluster description of magnetic systems @xcite . for several spin systems",
    "one finds that the magnetic transition may be characterized as a percolation phenomenon of suitably defined clusters .    with the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture in mind , which describes the deconfinement transition with an effective spin system",
    ", we can formulate the central questions we explore in our project :    * can one identify ( at least near @xmath12 ) characteristic properties of spin - like behavior in an ab - initio lattice simulation of pure gauge theory and/or full qcd ? *",
    "is it possible to identify spatial structures ( clusters ) that correspond to weiss domains ? * how do the domains behave near @xmath12 ?",
    "do suitably defined clusters percolate ?",
    "* what is the role of the fermion determinant which breaks the underlying center symmetry ?",
    "* can the clusters ( weiss domains ) be given a physical meaning also in the continuum limit ?    for su(2 )",

    "the situation is different .",
    "one of the three center phases is more populated . for full qcd ,",
    "where the fermion determinant acts like an external field , it is always the real center sector ( phase values near 0 ) which becomes enhanced . in the quenched case",
    "any of the three center sectors may be selected spontaneously ( similar to , e.g. , the ising system where the magnetization has two signs to choose from in the symmetry broken phase ) . in the quenched distribution",
    "we show here we have chosen configurations where the phase angle of the summed polyakov loop @xmath6 is near @xmath46 and obviously the local phases are enhanced for that value .",
    "if one switches to any of the other equivalent center sectors , the distribution is shifted by @xmath47 .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that the transition to the deconfined phase is accompanied by an increasing population of the histograms for the phase @xmath40 of the local polyakov loop @xmath1 near one of the center angles .",
    "this accumulation of the local phases in one sector drives the increase of the expectation value @xmath16 , while the modulus of the local loops plays no role .",
    "it is interesting to note that at high temperatures ( bottom plots in fig .",
    "2 ) there are still pronounced peaks also in the subdominant sectors .",
    "the question is whether the phase values at different positions @xmath3 are distributed independently , or if there are spatial domains where the phases of the local polyakov loops tend to align in the same center sector .",
    "the latter case is what is suggested by the effective action ( [ effact ] ) , where the first term favors parallel spins .    in order to study the formation of domains we assign sector numbers @xmath48 to the sites @xmath3 , @xmath49 \\ ; , \\\\ 0 & \\ ; \\mbox{for } \\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\varphi(\\vec{x } ) \\ ,",

    "these points do not have a clear preference for one of the center sectors and the parameter @xmath50 allows one to remove them from the cluster analysis .",
    "the remaining lattice points @xmath3 can now be organized in clusters according to the sector numbers : we put two neighboring points @xmath51 into the same cluster if @xmath52 . for illustration purposes in fig .",

    "the plot is for lattice size @xmath53 and a value of @xmath50 chosen such that 39 % of the lattices points are cut .",

    "of course the cutoff parameter @xmath50 will influence the size of the clusters , since with increasing @xmath50 less sites are available .",

    "both in the quenched and the dynamical case we observe that the clusters start out small below @xmath12 and grow quickly in size at the transition temperature .",
    "if one analyzes the percolation probability one finds that for the quenched case , where we have a true phase transition , this probability indeed approaches a step function as the volume is increased . for the dynamical case , where one observes only a crossover @xcite ,",
    "the situation concerning percolation is not yet clear and further studies on several volumes will be necessary to settle this issue .",
    "we have shown that the phases @xmath40 of the local polyakov loops @xmath1 have preferred values near the center angles , and that neighboring sites have a tendency towards aligning these phases .",
    "the corresponding clusters were found to grow quickly near the transition / crossover temperature , and at least for the quenched case the deconfinement transition may be characterized by the onset of percolation for suitably defined clusters . so far",
    "this picture is established only for a fixed lattice spacing @xmath55 and some arbitrarily chosen value of the cutoff parameter @xmath50 which enters our cluster definition .",
    "if one wants to assign a physical significance to the center clusters , a way of constructing them such that a continuum limit can be taken is necessary .",
    "in particular this involves a prescription for connecting the scale @xmath55 in physical units to the clusters .",
    "we begin with defining the linear extension ( radius ) of a cluster by considering the expectation value of two - point correlators @xmath56 for sites @xmath57 within the same cluster .",
    "these 2-point functions decay exponentially , @xmath58 , and we use the parameter @xmath59 to define the radius of the cluster in units of the lattice spacing @xmath55 . using the value of the lattice constant @xmath55 in fm , the diameter of the clusters in physical units ( fm ) is then given by @xmath60 .",
    "the result will depend on both , the lattice spacing @xmath55 and the cutoff @xmath50 . in order to compare the physical size of the clusters for different lattice resolutions @xmath55 ,",
    "we always adjust @xmath50 such that at a low temperature ( @xmath61 for the quenched case where this analysis is done ) we fix the physical diameter to a typical hadronic size , e.g. , @xmath62 fm .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath50 is then kept fixed for all other temperatures , and is used to study @xmath63 as a function of @xmath11 . in fig .",
    "5 we show the result for the cluster diameter @xmath63 in physical units as a function of temperature for the quenched case , comparing two different resolution scales @xmath55 ( i.e. , @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) .",
    "it is obvious that also in physical units the phase transition is signaled by a sudden increase of the cluster size .",
    "furthermore , the results for the two different scales fall onto a universal curve , which suggests that a continuum limit for the cluster size might exist .",
