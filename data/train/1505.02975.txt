    "high - order series expansions are an important tool in statistical physics .",
    "typically , the linked cluster theorem is used to determine the correct expression of physical quantities up to high orders in perturbation by performing calculations on finite linked clusters . historically , such _ linked cluster expansions _",
    "date back to the 1950 s and 1960 s @xcite , where high - temperature series for extensive thermodynamic quantities have been determined .",
    "similarly , extensive zero - temperature ground - state properties like the ground - state energy or susceptibilities can be calculated via linked cluster expansions as first proposed by nickel in 1980 and implemented by marland in 1981 @xcite .",
    "further progress has been made steadily over the years @xcite .    for non - extensive quantities like excitation energies ,",
    "however , linked cluster expansions are more complicated and for a long time the calculation of an energy gap was only achieved by a deficient scheme which also needed _ unlinked _",
    "clusters @xcite .",
    "it took until 1996 when gelfand set up a true linked cluster expansion for a one - particle dispersion @xcite .",
    "gelfand realized that quantum fluctuations of the vacuum have to be subtracted from one - particle hopping amplitudes to perform proper linked cluster expansions . yet ,",
    "unrealized at that time , this approach in terms of similarity transformations on graphs violates the cluster additivity and is therefore inapplicable when the ground state and the targeted excitation - subspace are characterized by identical quantum numbers . in 2000 .",
    "it has been shown that the use of orthogonal transformations on graphs restores the cluster addiditivity and therefore allows for a consistent calculation of many - particle excitation energies @xcite .    at the same time , an alternative route to linked - cluster expansions has been established by the method of perturbative continuous unitary transformations ( pcuts ) @xcite allowing for the calculation of high - order series expansions for many - particle excitation energies as well as spectral densities @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the other approaches mentioned above , in pcuts a quasi - particle conserving effective hamiltonian in second quantization is derived model - independently , with the constrained that the unperturbed part of the hamiltonian has an equidistant spectrum and is bounded from below .",
    "interestingly , this method fulfills the cluster additivity by construction . in recent years , pcuts were indeed used as linked - cluster expansions , i.e.  a full graph decomposition has been implemented to calculate relevant matrix elements .",
    "important examples are the derivation of effective low - energy spin models for the hubbard model on the triangular and honeycomb lattice @xcite , the calculation of the one - magnon gap for the fully - frustrated transverse field ising model on the triangular and kagome lattice @xcite , the treatment of topological phase transitions of perturbed non - abelian string - net models on the honeycomb lattice @xcite , or the determination of the one - triplon dispersion of coupled heisenberg dimers on hypercubic lattices for arbitrary dimension @xcite .",
    "overall , linked cluster expansions constitute an efficient tool with a vast variety of applications . at this point , let us also mention the recently developed non - perturbative variants of linked cluster expansions combining a graph decomposition with exact diagonalization @xcite , with continuous unitary transformations @xcite or density matrix renormalization group @xcite .",
    "the numerical power of all ( perturbative ) linked - cluster approaches , especially in more than one dimension , relies on a full graph decomposition . to this end",
    "the lattice is devided into small subclusters on which the actual calculations are carried out .",
    "afterwards , results in the thermodynamic limit are obtained by embedding properly the finite - cluster results into the infinite system .",
    "if all sites of two different subclusters are coupled identically , these clusters are indistinguishable for the hamiltonian and are called topologically equivalent .",
    "therefore , the calculation can be restricted to topologically distinct clusters yielding a highly efficient approach .",
    "however , the number of topologically distinct graphs grows exponentially with the order of perturbation as well as with the total number of different coupling constants .",
    "consequently , it becomes very hard to reach sufficiently high orders for problems with several expansion parameters .",
    "this is especially relevant for the comparison with experimental data where typically different coupling strengths are important and have to be determined .    in this work",
    "we introduce a new kind of graph expansion , a so - called _ white graph expansion _ , which overcomes the latter limitation to a great extent .",
    "the white graph expansion benefits directly from the underlying framework provided by the effective pcut hamiltonian in second quantization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by giving the set up of systems we focus on in this paper in sect .",
    "[ sect : set_up ] . in sect .",
    "[ sect : pcut ] we describe the pcut method and its implementation as a linked cluster expansion .",
    "the white graph expansion is then introduced in sect .",
    "[ sect : white_graph_expansion ] and it is applied to coupled two - leg xxz ladders in sect .",
    "[ sect : xxz_ladders ] . finally , we give conclusions in sect .  [",
    "sect : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a generic quantum lattice hamiltonian @xmath0 at zero temperature . by decomposing the original lattice into a superlattice of supersites ,",
    "one can always rewrite _ exactly _ @xmath1 as @xmath2 here a supersite might be a spin , two linked spins like a dimer , or any other finite set of linked sites which can be easily diagonalized and which has an equidistant spectrum bounded from below .",
    "the unperturbed part of @xmath3 is diagonal in supersites @xmath4 of the lattice and can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes a constant and the sum over @xmath7 runs over all excited local degrees of freedom . the unperturbed ground state @xmath8 is interpreted as the vacuum and is given as the product state @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the lowest state of a supersite .",
    "accordingly , @xmath11 creates a local excitation of type @xmath7 on supersite @xmath4 . in the following",
    "we assume the local spectrum to be equidistant .",
    "consequently , it is always possible to introduce the counting operator .",
    "supersites interact via the perturbation .",
    "the sum over @xmath12 runs over all @xmath13 perturbation parameters @xmath14 .",
    "the different operators @xmath15 build the bonds of the lattice , so that one can assign a different `` color '' for each perturbation parameter @xmath14 . here",
    "we restrict the discussion to hamiltonians where the perturbation @xmath16 couples two supersites .",
    "a generalization to perturbations which couple an arbitrary number of supersites is straightforward .    as a consequence of eq .  , one can rewrite eq .",
    "[ eq : hami ] as @xmath17 so that @xmath18=nt_n$ ] .",
    "physically , the operator @xmath19 corresponds to all operators where the change of energy quanta with respect to @xmath20 is exactly @xmath21 .",
    "the maximal ( finite ) change in energy quanta is called @xmath22 .",
    "the pcut method is an efficient tool for the calculation of high - order series expansions for hamiltonians of the form eq .",
    "the application consists essentially of two steps : i ) the perturbative order - by - order solution of the so - called flow equation yielding an effective hamiltonian and effective observables and ii ) a non - trivial extraction of the effective low - energy physics .",
    "the first step depends only on the structure of the perturbation , namely , how many particles at most are created ( annihilated ) by the perturbation . in this sense ,",
    "the obtained solution is model independent .",
    "however , this generality comes at the price of a complex model dependend extraction process because the effective operators are not normal - ordered , i.e.  the desired matrix elements have to be extracted in a separate ( second ) step .",
    "the real challenge lies in this second step which represents the model - dependend part and therefore typically is the bottle - neck of the calculation .",
    "the extraction process is based on the linked - cluster theorem which allows the determination of matrix elements in the thermodynamic limit by applying the effective operators to _ finite _ clusters . at the end of this process",
    "a normal - ordered low - energy hamiltonian is obtained .",
    "essentially , two different schemes for the last step are possible .",
    "first , in the standard scheme the calculation is carried out on a single cluster @xcite which is sufficiently large to contain all processes of a desired perturbative order .",
    "the implementation of this approach is straightforward and details of the operator structure are irrelevant for the general scheme .",
    "however , in two or more dimensions , this is typically unfavourable because memory problems arise and a full cluster decomposition is the method of choice @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that a hybrid , a decomposition into rectangular clusters , has been also succesfully introduced recently for the pcut method @xcite .",
    "a rectangular cluster expansion seems to be especially well suited for non - perturbative extensions of linked cluster expansions , since a typical length scale can be assigned to each rectangular graph , which is much less trivial when performing a full graph decomposition @xcite .    in the following we start by briefly introducing the method of continuous unitary transformations and its perturbative variant , the pcut method .",
    "afterwards , we formulate the pcut method as a linked cluster expansion giving details to graph generation and graph embedding .      the objective of continuous unitary transformations ( cuts ) is to transform the hamiltonian into an optimized basis representation @xcite . the hamiltonian is then considered as a continuous function @xmath23 of the flow parameter @xmath24 with as the starting hamiltonian and as the effective hamiltonian . introducing the antihermitian generator @xmath25 of the cut ,",
    "one gets the flow equation @xmath26 \\ ; .\\ ] ]    here we choose the quasi - particle generator  @xcite @xmath27 in an eigenbasis @xmath28 of the counting operator @xmath29 , i.e.  , as introduced in eq .  .",
    "the commutator in the flow equation eq",
    ".   leads typically to an infinite number of terms , so that a truncation must be performed . in the pcut method ,",
    "the truncation is done in a perturbative manner and , accordingly , the flow equation is solved via the perturbative ansatz @xmath30 implying , according to eq .  , @xmath31 here ,",
    "the following notations have been introduced @xmath32 ansatz leads to recursive differential equations for the real functions @xmath33 with the initial conditions @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 recovering the initial hamiltonian . due to the structure of the recursive equations",
    ", they can be solved in principal analytically .",
    "the calculation of the analytic functions @xmath38 can be performed on a computer up to a certain order @xmath39 limited by the computation time and the memory usage only @xcite .",
    "the solution leads to an effective hamiltonian of the form @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "the restriction @xmath42 reflects the particle - conserving property @xmath43=0 $ ] of the final hamiltonian .",
    "the summands can be viewed as virtual fluctuations of the new dressed particles defined by the effective hamiltonian .    in a similar manner",
    "one can calculate other physical quantities with pcut @xcite . to this end",
    "the same unitary transformation has to be applied to any observable @xmath44 of interest @xmath45.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the perturbative ansatz @xmath46 with @xmath47 one obtains recursive differential equations for the functions @xmath48 .",
    "the final result is given by @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "in contrast to the effective hamiltonian , effective observables are _ not _ quasi - particle conserving .    the coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath52 are independent of the model and can be straightforwardly applied to all the problems matching the requirements of the pcut method .",
    "this generality is only possible at the expense of the second model - dependend extraction process described next for the effective hamiltonian @xmath53 .",
    "the treatment of effective observables can be done in complete analogy .       in the thermodynamic limit ( left panel )",
    "can be identified with a reduced contribution of a disconnected cluster ( right panel ) vanishing due to the linked cluster theorem . ]    since the effective operators like @xmath53 are not normal - ordered , matrix elements defining the effective model are not directly accesible . in order to calculate the desired matrix elements ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath54 can be applied to a finite cluster yielding the correct contributions in the thermodynamic limit for a given order and matrix element .",
    "this crucial property results from the linked cluster theorem which states that only linked processes have an overall contribution to cluster additive quantities .    as outlined in sect .",
    "[ sect : set_up ] , here we restrict the discussion to hamiltonians where the perturbation couples always two supersites .",
    "the coupling between supersites is represented by a link in the cluster and the operator can be decomposed as @xmath55 where @xmath56 affects only the two supersites which are connected by the link @xmath57 in the effective lattice .",
    "we say , that the operator @xmath56 acts on the link @xmath57 .",
    "the sum runs over all links of the lattice . inserting this decomposition into eq .",
    "yields @xmath58 in practice , however , the hamiltonian is applied using eq .  .",
    "each summand of order @xmath59 can be understood as a virtual fluctuation involving the links @xmath60 .",
    "the links form a pattern which can be assigned to a cluster consisting of these links and adjacent sites .",
    "if the fluctuation pattern corresponds to a disconneted cluster , the overall contribution of all summands associated with this pattern annihilate each other and such fluctuation patterns can be discarded , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : disconnected_fluctuations ] .     in the thermodynamic limit ( left panel ) . ]",
    "if the links ( and the adjacent sites ) form a connected cluster @xmath61 , the process is called linked and the hamiltonian can be rewritten as sum over these linked clusters    @xmath62    note that there are also fluctuation patterns which correspond to a lower particle channel since not all excitations are involved in the fluctuation as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : different_labelings ] .",
    "these fluctuations cancel via the subtraction scheme required for the normal ordering .",
    "a linked cluster expansion therefore naturally arises from the pcut approach .",
    "the simplest approach is now to design a sufficiently large cluster which incorporates all the relevant linked fluctuations of a desired order and to carry out the calculation on this single cluster .",
    "yet , the calculation based on this approach still incorporates a lot of unlinked processes resulting in an unnecessary computational overhead .",
    "furthermore , these processes are kept in the memory during the calculation which usually defines the highest possible order .",
    "it is therefore typically favourable to use a full cluster decomposition . to this end",
    "the contribution of ( small ) clusters is calculated by applying @xmath63 to all clusters determining the corresponding matrix elements which requires a minimal memory usage .",
    "contributions of smaller subclusters have then to be subtracted in order to gain the reduced contributions of the cluster and to avoid double counting of fluctuations .",
    "hence , after the subtraction , every link @xmath64 in eq .   is involved at least once .",
    "the matrix elements in the thermodynamic limit are then determined by summing up all the reduced contributions of these subclusters .",
    "the efficiency of this approach is based on the identification of clusters by means of the topology which implies that the calculation can be restricted to a much smaller set of toplogically distinct clusters called graphs .      in the following ,",
    "we briefly outline the underlying concepts of the toplogical identification by means of a canonical labeling .",
    "the identification process is oriented on the details given in ref .  .",
    "first , we consider a system where all ( super ) sites are coupled by identical undirected bonds . in this case , a cluster is fully determined by an ( arbitrary ) numeration of the sites and the bonds linking the sites .",
    "a cluster of @xmath21 sites can be represented by a @xmath65 adjacency matrix @xmath66 with @xmath67 two clusters are called topologically equivalent , if a simple renumeration of the sites yields the same adjacency matrix in both cases .",
    "obviously , it is sufficient to restrict the calculation to topologically distinct clusters ( graphs ) because the results can easily be mapped via a relabeling .",
    "in order to identify clusters as topologically equivalent , it is reasonable to introduce a canonical labeling which is distinct from other labelings . to this end , one identifies the off - diagonal elements @xmath66 ( @xmath68 ) as the binary bits of an integer number with the order @xmath69 serving as a key .",
    "the labeling which maximizes this key corresponds to the canoncial labeling and defines the graph , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : different_labelings ] for examples .",
    "if two clusters are topologically equivalent , they are assigned to the same graph . in practice , it is necessary to find the labeling which maximizes the key efficiently .",
    "we do not go into technical details for the implementation .",
    "for further reading we refer to ref .  .",
    "using the graph key , it is possible to schematically produce the required connected graphs by successively adding links to a given set of graphs .",
    "furthermore , the number of graphs relevant for the calculation can be additionally reduced . obviously , it is sufficient to include only graphs that can be embedded into the lattice under consideration , i.e.  if the lattice contains clusters corresponding to this graph .    by construction ,",
    "the reduced contribution of a graph of @xmath21 links starts at most at order @xmath21 .",
    "hence , for a given order @xmath21 , all connected graphs of up to @xmath21 links ahave to be considered .",
    "depending on the problem , further selection rules can help to reduce the number of relevant graphs because the presence of conserved quantities might result in further constraints for a given order .",
    "the next step is to perform the actual calculation on graphs , i.e.  @xmath70 is evaluated to determine the relevant low - energy matrix elements .",
    "for the implementation , one typically chooses the eigenbasis of @xmath71 , i.e.  every basis state can be identified with a defined distribution of bare excitations . during the application of the operator sequences in @xmath70",
    "the intermediate states are represented as linear combinations of these basis states @xmath72 are represented by integer numbers where the information of the basis states is encoded bitwise in the bit representation of an integer as known for instance from exact diagonalization . in this basis , the action of the operators in eq .",
    "affects only a small number of bits allowing for a fast access and modifications via bitwise operations .",
    "compared to the dimension of the full hilbert space , the number of terms in an intermediate state is small .",
    "therefore , it is useful to use associative arrays consisting of a key ( the state represented by an integer ) and an associated value ( the coefficient @xmath73 represented by a rational number ) .",
    "this is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : the_calculation]a .",
    "the desired matrix elements are then given as series expansions with rational coefficients . in order to gain cluster additive quantities for the embedding ,",
    "the normal ordering is applied followed by the subtraction of subclusters contributions .",
    "finally , the graphs are embedded into the infinite lattice , i.e.  all realizations of a given graph on the lattice are produced recovering all the clusters in eq .",
    "[ linked_cluster_decomposition ] via the appropriate relabeling .",
    "the contributions of the cluster additive quantities are added up accordingly .",
    "note that the contributions of all linked clusters in eq .   are incorporated while the actual calculation is performed on a massively smaller subset of topologically distinct clusters .",
    "the embedding procedure is straightforward and technical details of the implementation can be found in ref .  .",
    "typically , the bottleneck of the calculation is defined by the derivation of the effective model on the graphs via pcuts .",
    "hence , the efficiency of this approach is based on the identifcation of clusters and the associated reduction of the number of clusters involved in the calculations .",
    "up to now , we have described the essential steps to set up a linked cluster expansion with the pcut method .",
    "this standard scheme becomes inefficient when the physical system possesses many linktypes corresponding to perturbation parameters @xmath14 , which is for example relevant when fitting experimental data with microscopic calculations .",
    "these linktypes function as another topological attribute which can be incorporated in the usual scheme by generalizing for @xmath21 linktypes .",
    "clearly , this leads to an exponential growth of relevant graphs needed for the calculation .",
    "however , as we demonstrate in the following , one can circumvent this inconvenience by a so - called white - graph expansion .",
    "the underlying principle of the white - graph expansion is to ignore the different linktypes ( colors ) for the topological classification of the clusters .",
    "the white - graph number is simply defined using eq .   and",
    "the calculation is restricted to topologically distinct clusters in this sense .",
    "however , the contributions of clusters in eq .   _ can not _ be gained by a simple mapping of the sites because the contributions do differ depending on the color pattern of the links . to this end ,",
    "additional information are tracked during the pcut calculation on the single graphs allowing to restore the contribution of each cluster exactly from the calculation on white graphs .",
    "+       corresponds to a rational number .",
    "( b ) standard calculation on white graps expansion using the generalized monoms as written in eq .  .",
    "( c ) improved calculation on white graphs following eq .   which uses the product structure of the generalized monoms .",
    "]    the additional bookkeeping can be interpreted as an enhanced or generalized monom ; additional values @xmath74 are assigned to the links to keep track of the relevant information .",
    "the latter can be comprised in a single object @xmath75 which can be viewed as a generalized monom .",
    "the choice of @xmath75 is problem dependent and must be adjusted for each application .",
    "if the links differ only with respect to the coupling strength , it is sufficient to track how often each link was active in the operator sequence applied to the current state . for more complex problems ,",
    "more information must be tracked and this approach may become unfavorable in scenarios where a lot of linktypes are involved and the non - zero matrix elements differ greatly between the linktypes .",
    "however , in principle it is always possible to track the relevant information .    evaluated for a given link pattern , the generalized monoms must yield an actual polynom in the multiple perturbation parameters of the different couplings such that the result corresponds exactly to the calculation on a cluster having this very link pattern .",
    "this allows for the subsequent evaluation necessary for the embedding procedure .",
    "as indicated by the name , the generalized monoms obey @xmath76 and the intermediate states during the calculation are then expressed as linear combinations of these elements : @xmath77 and the state @xmath78 independently ; similarly to the action on product wave functions .    as in a standard pcut set up",
    ", it is reasonable to use associative arrays to represent the intermediate states .",
    "the information of a generalized monom can analogously be encoded bitwise . in a naive implementation ,",
    "the state combined with the generalized monom defines the key and the associated amplitude @xmath79 corresponds to the value as visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : the_calculation]b .    in an improved implementation",
    ", one can make use of the product structure of the generalized monoms as well as of the intermediate states and factorise the representation : latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath108 , @xmath109 is the number of unit cells , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",

    "indeed , the resulting hamiltonian can be rephrased as @xmath120 meeting all criteria relevant to apply the pcut method as described in detail above : i ) the unperturbed hamiltonian at @xmath119 is equidistant , ii ) the unperturbed spectrum is bounded from below , and iii ) the perturbation is decomposed in @xmath121 operators .",
    "one can therefore map eq .   to an effective model , @xmath122 , which conserves the number of magnons .",
    "the one - magnon sector @xmath123 , which is of our interest here , corresponds in real space to an effective hopping hamiltonian for the magnons and is therefore fully determined by the one - magnon hopping amplitudes .",
    "here we have calculated all these hopping amplitudes by series expansion up to 13th order in all parameters @xmath124 . at this order",
    "one has to treat @xmath125 white graphs in total .",
    "clearly , the number of graphs with color is many orders of magnitude larger and a related calculation is far beyond any realistic set up .",

    "this is in fact identical to the approach where _ all _ links of a graph have different coupling constants and the result is given as a multi - variable polynom .",

    "as outlined in ref .  , the quantum critical behavior is mean - field like , i.e.  one has critical exponents @xmath163 and @xmath164 .     as a function of @xmath137 for the isotropic square lattice @xmath161 for different bare series and different ( biased ) dlogpad extrapolants .",
    "_ inset _ : zoom close to @xmath118 . ]",
    "our results for the one - magnon gap are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap_vs_tau_isotropic ] .",
    "the bare series is reliable up to @xmath165 predicting an unphysical gap for @xmath118 .",
    "this situation is strongly improved using dlogpad extrapolation .",
    "essentially all extrapolants show a pole close to @xmath166 . taking all",
    "@xmath167 $ ] of highest order @xmath168 with @xmath169 and @xmath169 , the average pole is found at @xmath170 with an average critical exponent @xmath171 very close to the expected value @xmath172 .",
    "the quality of the extrapolation gets even better when biasing the extrapolants such that they exhibit a pole at exactly @xmath118 . in this case",
    "one finds an average critical exponent @xmath173 .",
    "overall , we therefore find quantitative agreement even in the most demanding quantum critical regime using our high - order series expansion .",
    "let us stress that similarly well converged results can be directly deduced in all parts of the ( large ) parameter space .",
    "in this work we have introduced the so - called white graph expansion for the method of perturbative continuous unitary transformations when implemented as a linked cluster expansion . the essential idea behind this expansion is an optimal bookkeeping during the calculation on graphs which is possible due to the presence of the model - independent effective pcut hamiltonian in second quantization .",
    "our approach is especially useful when the microscopic model under consideration has several expansion parameters .",
    "this case usually represents a major challenge for any kind of linked cluster expansion due to the proliferating number of linked graphs .",
    "indeed , each expansion parameter corresponds to a distinct color in the graph expansion .",
    "the white graph expansion overcomes this challenge to a great extent , since the actual calculation is performed on white graphs and the coloring is done after the calculation as a final step .",
    "we are strongly convinced that this white graph expansion is useful in many situations , e.g.  microscopic models in three dimension or systems with long - rang interactions being notoriously complicated for linked - cluster expansions .",
    "finally , it would be interesting whether other types of linked - cluster expansions like for expample takahashi s degenerate perturbation theory @xcite or matrix perturbation theory @xcite can be also reformulated as a white graph expansion .",
