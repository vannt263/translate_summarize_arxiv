    "<S> we study the billiard map corresponding to a periodic lorentz gas in 2-dimensions in the presence of small holes in the table . </S>",
    "<S> we allow holes in the form of open sets away from the scatterers as well as segments on the boundaries of the scatterers . for a large class of smooth initial distributions </S>",
    "<S> , we establish the existence of a common escape rate and normalized limiting distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this limiting distribution is conditionally invariant and is the natural analogue of the srb measure of a closed system . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we prove that as the size of the hole tends to zero , the limiting distribution converges to the smooth invariant measure of the billiard map .    </S>",
    "<S> [ section ] [ theorem]lemma [ theorem]sublemma [ theorem]convention [ theorem]proposition [ theorem]remark [ theorem]definition [ theorem]corollary [ section ]    this paper is about _ leaky dynamical systems _ , or _ dynamical systems with holes_. consider a dynamical system defined by a map or a flow on a phase space @xmath0 , and let @xmath1 be a hole through which orbits escape , that is to say , once an orbit enters @xmath2 , we stop considering it from that point on . </S>",
    "<S> starting from an initial probability distribution @xmath3 on @xmath0 , mass will leak out of the system as it evolves . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath4 denote the distribution remaining at time @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the most basic question one can ask about a leaky system is its _ rate of escape _ , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. whether @xmath6 for some @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> . another important question concerns the nature of the remaining distribution . </S>",
    "<S> one way to formulate that is to normalize @xmath4 , and to inquire about properties of @xmath8 as @xmath5 tends to infinity . such limiting distributions , when they exist , are not invariant ; they are _ conditionally invariant _ , meaning they are invariant up to a normalization . comparisons of systems with small holes with the corresponding _ closed _ systems , i.e. systems for which the holes have been plugged , are also natural </S>",
    "<S> . these are some of the questions we will address in this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> we do not consider these questions in the abstract , however ; for a review paper in this direction , see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our context here is that of billiard systems with small holes . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we carry out our analysis for the collision map of a 2-dimensional periodic lorentz gas , and expect our results to be extendable to other dispersing billiards . </S>",
    "<S> our holes are  physical \" holes , in the sense that they are derived from holes in the physical domain of the system , i.e. , the billiard table : we consider both convex holes away from the scatterers and holes that live on the boundaries of the scatterers . </S>",
    "<S> the holes considered in this paper are very small , but their placements are immaterial . for these leaky systems , </S>",
    "<S> we prove that there is a common rate of escape and a common limiting distribution for a large class of natural initial distributions including those with densities with respect to liouville measure . </S>",
    "<S> these conditionally invariant measures , therefore , can be viewed as characteristic of the leaky systems in question , in a way that is analogous to physical measures or srb measures for closed systems . </S>",
    "<S> we show , in fact , that as hole size tends to zero , these measures tend to the natural invariant measure of the corresponding closed billiard system .    </S>",
    "<S> our proof involves constructing a markov tower extension with a special property over the billiard map , the new requirement being that it _ respects the hole_. let us backtrack a little for readers not already familiar with these ideas : in much the same way that markov partitions have proved to be very useful in the study of anosov and axiom a diffeomorphisms , it was shown , beginning with [ y ] and continued in a number of other papers , that many systems with sufficiently strong hyperbolic properties ( but which are not necessarily uniformly hyperbolic ) admit countable markov extensions . roughly speaking , these extensions behave like countable state markov chains  with nonlinearity \" ; they have considerably simpler structures than the original dynamical system . </S>",
    "<S> the idea behind this work is that escape dynamics are much simpler in a markov setting when the hole corresponds to a collection of  states \" ; this is what we mean by the markov extension  respecting the hole . \" </S>",
    "<S> all this is not for free , however . </S>",
    "<S> we pay a price with a somewhat elaborate construction of the tower , and again when we pass the information back to the billiard system , in exchange for having a markov structure to work with in the treatment of the hole .    </S>",
    "<S> there are advantages to this route of proof : first , once a markov extension is constructed for a system , it can be used many times over for entirely different purposes . for the billiard maps studied here </S>",
    "<S> , these extensions were constructed in [ y ] ; our main task is to adapt them to holes . </S>",
    "<S> second , once results on escape dynamics are established on towers , they apply to all markov extensions . here , the desired results are already known in a special case , namely expanding towers @xcite ; we need to extend them to the general , hyperbolic setting . </S>",
    "<S> _ what we propose here is a unified , generic approach for dealing with holes in dynamical systems _ , one that can , in principle , be carried out for all systems that admit markov towers . </S>",
    "<S> such systems include logistic maps , rank one attractors including the hnon family , piecewise hyperbolic maps and other dispersing billiards in 2 or more dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> conditionally invariant measures were first introduced in probabilistic settings , namely countable state markov chains and topological markov chains , beginning with @xcite and more recently in @xcite and @xcite . in this </S>",
    "<S> setting , such measures are called quasi - stationary distributions and the existence of a yaglom limit corresponds to the limit @xmath8 , which we use here to identify a physical conditionally invariant measure for the leaky system .    </S>",
    "<S> the first works to study deterministic systems with holes took advantage of finite markov partitions . </S>",
    "<S> these include : expanding maps on @xmath9 with holes which are elements of a finite markov partition @xcite ; smale horseshoes @xcite ; anosov diffeomorphisms @xcite ; billiards with convex scatterers satisfying a non - eclipsing condition @xcite and large parameter logistic maps whose critical point maps out of the interval @xcite . in the latter two , </S>",
    "<S> the holes are chosen in such a way that the surviving dynamics are uniformly expanding or hyperbolic with markov partitions . </S>",
    "<S> first results which drop markov requirements on the map include piecewise expanding maps of the interval @xcite ; misiurewicz @xcite and collet - eckmann @xcite maps with generic holes ; and piecewise uniformly hyperbolic maps @xcite . the tower construction is used in the one - dimensional studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> typically a restriction on the size of the hole is introduced in order to control the dynamics when a finite markov partition is absent .    </S>",
    "<S> general conditions ensuring the existence of conditionally invariant measures are first given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the physical relevance of such measures , however , is unclear without further qualifications . as noted in @xcite , under very weak assumptions on the dynamical system , </S>",
    "<S> many such measures exist : for any prescribed rate of escape , one can construct infinitely many conditionally invariant densities . </S>",
    "<S> this is the reason for the emphasis placed in this paper on the limit @xmath8 , which identifies a unique , physically relevant conditionally invariant measure .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is organized as follows : our results are formulated in sect .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> in sects .  2 and 3 , the geometry of billiard maps and holes are looked at carefully as we modify previous constructions to give a generalized horseshoe that respects the hole . out of this horseshoe </S>",
    "<S> , a markov tower extension is constructed and results on escape dynamics on it proved ; this is carried out in sects .  4 and 5 . </S>",
    "<S> these results are passed back to the billiard system in sect .  6 , where the remaining theorems are also proved . </S>"
