    "in polymer nematics , deformations of orientational order are inextricably linked to density .",
    "splay deformations necessarily introduce local changes in polymer density , which become progressively more expensive as chain length grows @xcite . in the continuous limit of long chains this coupling between the polymer density and orientational fields",
    "is described by an analogue of the continuity equation for the nematic director field @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the areal number density of chains crossing the plane perpendicular to the director field @xcite .",
    "the constraint imposed by the polar nematic order can be interpreted as the continuity condition for a `` polymer current density '' @xmath3 and the only difference w.r.t .",
    "the usual continuity equation is that in this case @xmath4 does not describe a rate ( there is no time derivative involved in its definition ) , i.e. , we are observing the number of chains perforating the perpendicular plane rather than the number of particles crossing it per unit time .",
    "the analogy comes fully into life if one relaxes the condition @xmath5 and takes into account the variable degree of nematic order .",
    "then one can define the complete _ nematic polymer current density _",
    "@xcite @xmath6 that obeys the conservation law @xmath7 with @xmath8 the volume number density of monomers ( or any arbitrarily defined chain segments ) , @xmath9 the corresponding monomer length , and @xmath10 the volume number density of the beginnings ( @xmath11 ) and the ends ( @xmath12 ) of the chains .",
    "the non - unit nematic vector order parameter @xmath13 is defined as the average of the monomer unit vectors @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where @xmath0 is a unit polar nematic director and @xmath16 is the degree of polar order .",
    "the areal number density of perforating chains @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ continuity_basic ] ) is thus @xmath17 .",
    "the continuity equation ( [ current_continuity ] ) for the polymer current presents a coupling of the director splay deformation and the variation of the density , which in the infinite chain limit @xmath18 strictly follows the constraint @xmath19 note that this constraint involves also the variations of the degree of order @xmath20 , besides the splay deformation of the director field .    while previous theoretical treatments have focused on the structure of polar chain order and the consequent constraints for the vector order parameter , in this paper we consider the consequences of microscopic chain constructure for the quadrupolar order of a true polymer nematic , which respects the symmetry of local reversal of chain orientation ( @xmath21 ) . unlike the polar state",
    ", nematic is described by a tensorial order parameter @xmath22  @xcite @xmath23 the most obvious difference between the polar and the quadrupolar phases is the existence of @xmath24 disclinations in the latter , fig .",
    "[ defects ] .    even in the global or local absence of topological defects where the @xmath22-tensor is uniaxial and expressed by the polar nematic director @xmath0 , @xmath25 there exist microscopic differences between the polar and a quadrupolar phases beyond the @xmath26 symmetry of the latter .",
    "namely , for a polymer the notion of polarity is slightly more delicate , as only the orientational part of the ordering is captured by the nematic order parameter , but not the chain connectivity .",
    "when the underlying building element itself ( the monomer ) is nonpolar and thus the phase can not exhibit any polar orientational order by construction , the underlying chain connectivity may exhibit a rich spectrum of states distinguished in terms of microscopic configurations of `` hairpins '' , fig .",
    "[ connectivity_polarity ] .    in the quadrupolar phase the hairpins can be present without destroying or altering the orientational order , but certainly not in the polar phase  @xcite .",
    "hairpins are not defects of the average mesoscopic orientational field , but rather microscopic wiggles not captured by the mesoscopic order parameter .",
    "hence , even in the simple uniaxial case in which the quadrupolar and polar phases look macroscopically alike , one anticipates that the coupling of the orientational field deformations and the density variations will be different . as the nematic polymer current density and the continuity equation it satisfies ( [ current_continuity ] ) are vectorial in nature , they can not be applied directly to the quadrupolar case , where the vector @xmath13 can not be defined .",
    "the question thus arises what is the correct form of the ordering constraint valid for polymer chains with inversion symmetry and the flexibility to make hairpin turns .",
    "moreover , we are led to ask what operators , if not the nematic order parameter tensor itself , carry information about the distribution of microscopic hairpins , whose energy cost is clearly not encoded in smooth distortions of the mean orientation @xmath27 . in this paper , we derive the constraint that must be satisfied by the nematic order parameter of chain systems exhibiting states of quadrupolar orientational order .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ derivation ] we present the conservation law obeyed by the nematic order parameter for polymers , and in sec .",
    "[ hairpins ] , we analyze how hairpins that do not contribute to the local value of the quadrupolar order parameter nevertheless influence its gradients . in sec .",
