    "estimating the age of the unresolved stellar populations observed in galaxies represents a major challenge in our understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "an ideal observation should allow us to infer the star formation history of galaxies from a set of various spectrophotometric observables .",
    "the light from a recent burst is dominated by the colour of ob stars , whereas the light from old stellar populations come predominantly from g- and k - type giants .",
    "hence , as a zeroth order approximation , broadband colours track the stellar age .",
    "however , this stellar clock is not good enough because of the effect of metallicity on age estimates so that  within the observational uncertainties  the colours of galaxies , whose light is dominated by old and metal - poor stars , may be indistinguishable from galaxies mainly composed of young and metal - rich stars .",
    "furthermore , this degeneracy can not be simply overcome by a better spectral resolution as targeted spectral indices such as the lick / ids system ( worthey et al .",
    "1994 ) suffer from an age - metallicity degeneracy similar to broadband photometry ( worthey 1994 ) .",
    "accurate spectroscopic dating of stellar populations has been attempted over the past years ( stockton , kellogg & ridgway 1995 ; dunlop et al .",
    "1996 ; spinrad et al . 1997 ; yi et al . 2000 ) although a comprehensive analysis of the effect of metallicity has not been considered in detail until recently ( nolan et al . 2003 ; ferreras , in preparation ) .",
    "this paper focuses on lbds  53w069 ( @xmath1 ) and lbds  53w091 ( @xmath0 ) , two faint radio galaxies from the leiden - berkeley deep survey ( hereafter lbds ; windhorst et al .",
    "1984a ; 1984b ) .",
    "the search for optical counterparts to faint radio emission is a technique which should allow us to spot old stellar populations at high redshifts ( kron , koo & windhorst 1985 ) .",
    "however , the light from many of these objects is dominated not by starlight but by the active nucleus .",

    "2003 ) suggests that a spectral coverage encompassing this break could be a good age indicator .",
    "therefore , we decided to test if optical seds covering the 4000  break lead to more refined age estimates than nuv seds .",
    "the right panels of figure  [ fig : syn ] explore this possibility .",
    "we generated 200  synthetic spectra corresponding to a ssp with @xmath52  gyr and @xmath53 from the yy models .",

    "the figure shows that one does not achieve a better age constraint at all by using the optical sed straddling the 4000  break , compared to using the rest - frame nuv sed .",
    "however , the snr=10 optical sed yields age estimates with markedly better accuracy compared to the snr=3 rest - frame nuv sed . for 15gyr populations , rest - frame optical seds should take shorter exposures by an order of magnitude to achieve the same snr and but require higher values of snr . it is encouraging to find that high snr rest - frame",
    "optical seds can be effective tools for deriving ages even at low spectral resolution ( 25 ) .",
    "one alternative way of estimating the ages from the flux across the 4000   break would be to perform broadband photometry .",
    "this is much less time - consuming than spectroscopy and it is questionable whether one can do better than shown in figure  [ fig : c2phot ] if a more accurate photometry is performed on these galaxies .",

    "this approach fares equally well compared to the more time - consuming continuum fitting at low snrs . the age - metallicity degeneracy still persists .      after exploring the various approaches discussed above ,",

    "balmer indices are very prominent in stellar atmospheres at @xmath67  k , which corresponds to main sequence a - type stars .",

    "old , metal - poor stars can also contribute significantly to balmer absorption lines ( lee , yoon , & lee 2000 ) .",

    "1990 ) implies that the stellar component is distributed over a significant range of metallicities .",
    "furthermore , low - mass ellipticals both nearby and at moderate redshifts display rest - frame nuv colours ( ferreras & silk 2000a ) , balmer absorption , and [ mg / fe ] abundance ratios ( trager et al . 2000 ) , all of which are indicative of a more extended star formation history ( ferreras & silk 2003 ) . hence",
    ", comparing early - type galaxies with ssps may not be such a good approximation .    furthermore , the morphological analysis of lbds  53w091 performed on hst images using wfpc2 and nicmos in the f814w , f110w and f160w passbands is suggestive of a two component system , comprising a compact de  vaucouleurs spheroid ( @xmath74  kpc ) plus an extended exponential disk ( @xmath75  kpc ) , which only appears in the bluer passband ( waddington et al .",

    "( 2003 ) , whose models give a stellar age around @xmath40  gyr .",
    "it is important to note that we achieve larger age estimates from the nuv spectral fitting analysis when we use @xmath99 models than when we use @xmath100 .",
    "the star and square in figure  [ fig : c2chem ] give the position of the best fit for the analysis using composite and simple stellar populations , respectively .",
    "the ssp analysis lies at the @xmath25 limit of a more consistent approach using a mixture of ages and metallicities .",
    "notice that the best fit for a composite model corresponds to an average age around 3.6  gyr with 0.8z@xmath101 ( table  [ tab : ages ] ) , whereas the ssp - based analysis shown in figure  [ fig : c2sed ] would require @xmath102  gyr if the assume the same metallicity .",
    "this result is a consequence of the mixture of stellar populations with difference ages and metallicities , and illustrates the fact that composite stellar population should be used for these analyses .",
    "furthermore , the best chemical enrichment model gives an average age and metallicity which would be readily ruled out in a naive approach using ssps ( see figure  [ fig : c2sed ] ) .",
    "one effective way to achieve a more accurate age estimate lies again in the use of age - sensitive observables such as balmer absorption .",
    "the dashed lines in figure  [ fig : c2chem ] give contours of the _ hypothetical _ h@xmath66 index measurements from @xmath24    in the upper right corner  to @xmath97   ( thick ) in steps of @xmath47  .",
    "the chemical enrichment model predictions correspond to values of h@xmath66 between @xmath24 and @xmath103  .",
    "hence , balmer absorption can significantly reduce the uncertainties in the age estimate and check the validity of the chemical enrichment models .",
    "furthermore , we must emphasize here that all age estimates based on spectral fittings over a wide range of wavelengths are heavily dependent on a precise calibration of the sed .",
    "the overall shape of the sed plays a crucial role in all model predictions presented in this paper .",
    "therefore , it is very important to understand the uncertainties in the flux calibration of the spectra to avoid large systematic errors in the analysis .",
    "hence , the analysis of balmer absorption should be considered as a valuable cross - check in order to give an accurate answer for the stellar ages .",
    "the observed rest - frame nuv seds of high redshift weak radio galaxies have been claimed to be robust estimators for the ages of old stellar populations at high redshifts , which in turn allow us to set constraints on the age of the universe and on cosmological parameters ( spinrad et al .",
    "however , in this paper we show that the combined effect of age and metallicity results in large error bars which are shown to be independent of the population synthesis model used .",
    "this problem persists even if we use the spectral energy distribution over a wide range of wavelengths instead of a set of broadband filters . only at snr=10 or greater",
    "can the data disentangle the degeneracy .",
    "unfortunately , this corresponds to prohibitively long exposure times on a 10  m - class telescope .",
    "a comparison of synthetic seds built from ssps , with noise mimicking that of the observed data , shows that signal to noise ratios close to those used in the analysis of lbds  53w091 ( i.e. snr@xmath104 3 ) are not high enough to yield age estimates with appreciable precision .",
    "slightly higher snr will help in reducing the error bar , but the age - metallicity degeneracy is still very strong unless one can achieve a snr=10 in rest frame nuv spectroscopy or even higher in the optical spectral window . in principle , it may appear that the rest - frame nuv would be a desirable window to explore for these galaxies since it could pose stronger constraints on the allowed region of parameter space compared to a rest - frame optical sed .",
    "however , the weaker stellar continuum and the strong effect of dust in this spectral region along with our poorer knowledge of stellar emission in the nuv imply that it may be more feasible and useful to obtain high precision rest - frame optical photometry straddling the 4000   break .",
    "old stellar populations are much brighter redward of the break , which results in higher snrs .",
    "dating unresolved stellar populations from their spectral energy distribution over a wide range of wavelengths is strongly dependent on the overall shape of the continuum .",
    "a small error in the flux calibration will distort this shape , thus altering the estimated ages and metallicities .",
    "hence , we want to emphasize that this type of studies requires seds with a very accurate flux calibration .",
    "as has been widely known for a decade , the use of balmer absorption lines , in combination with broadband photometry , largely solves the problem , and helps us in understanding a possible systematic effect derived from uncertainties in the flux calibration of the sed .",
    "as we discussed in  3 , different concerns would lead observers to choose different balmer indices . at @xmath105 indices such as h@xmath66 , h@xmath106 and",
    "h@xmath107 all appear in the nir spectral window , complicating an accurate ground - based spectroscopic measurement .",
    "hoping to break the infamous age - metallicity degeneracy from a theoretical point of view , we have explored a large set of chemically consistent @xmath99 population models . simply because no arbitrary metallicity is allowed in such a scheme ,",
    "this approach helped us determine metallicities much better .",
    "we found a better constraint on the age estimates , giving a range of ages between @xmath96 and @xmath97  gyr at the @xmath25 confidence level for both galaxies , with a metallicity around solar with a @xmath98  dex uncertainty .",
    "lbds  53w069 seems to accept models with higher average metallicities .",
    "our results  involving different sets of population synthesis models and a detailed chemical enrichment scenario  give similar results as the analysis of nolan et al .",
    "even though any model of chemical enrichment introduces further uncertainties in the modelling , galaxies should be considered composite models as the star formation takes place over times which are always longer than the characteristic chemical enrichment timescales .",
    "it is worth noticing that the best fits for a simple and a composite stellar population are marginally compatible ( see figure  [ fig : c2chem ] ) .",
    "hence , at the expense of adding further uncertainties to the modelling , we believe a proper mixture of stellar ages and metallicities should be considered in all photo - spectroscopic analyses of galaxies .",
