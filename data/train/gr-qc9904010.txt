    "a pair of compact objects ( black holes or neutron stars ) in binary orbit about one another is stable in newtonian gravity . in general relativity , however , the system will emit gravitational radiation , causing the bodies to spiral in towards one another .",
    "the gravitational radiation given off by this system is a prime candidate for detection by upcoming gravitational wave telescopes such as virgo and ligo",
    ".    when the compact objects are far apart , all gravitational effects are weak and one can use the post - newtonian approximation , expanding in powers of @xmath1 . the final `` plunge '' , where the objects cease to orbit and collide rapidly , can be modelled by full general relativistic three - plus - one supercomputer simulations .",
    "an intermediate late inspiral phase , where strong gravitational effects are important , but the fraction of total energy lost to gravitational radiation each orbit is small , can not be handled by supercomputer evolutions , which become unstable after several orbits . to handle strong gravity and slow inspiral",
    ", we need to use an approximation scheme .",
    "modelling this intermediate phase will allow us to determine the early gravitational wave signal as well as provide initial data for the final plunge simulations .",
    "the idea , initially proposed by steven detweiler @xcite , is that if the inspiral is slow , the system is nearly periodic : after one orbit , the objects have returned almost to their original locations , and radiation which has moved out has been replaced with new radiation of approximately the same shape . if the objects orbits are circular rather than elliptical , the spacetime is nearly stationary . if the approximate orbital frequency is @xmath2 , moving forward in time by @xmath3 and rotating the resulting spatial slice by @xmath4 will not change the picture very much .",
    "our approach is to replace the true spacetime , which has this approximate continuous symmetry , with another solution to einstein s equations in which the symmetry is exact .",
    "this `` stationary quasi - solution '' , which must somehow replace the energy lost in radiation to prevent inspiral , should approximate the physical `` quasi - stationary solution '' over some time interval .",
    "this replaces a three - plus - one - dimensional numerical evolution with a three - dimensional instantaneous solution , reducing greatly the computing power required and hopefully escaping some of the numerical instabilities associated with evolution .    to further simplify the problem",
    ", we will initially look for a spacetime with an additional translational symmetry orthogonal to the orbital plane .",
    "this toy model of co - orbiting cosmic strings further reduces the numerical problem to two dimensions while hopefully retaining some of the qualitative features .",
    "the rest of this paper consists of summaries of three techniques being developed for this project , but which may prove useful in other settings as well .",
    "section  [ sec:2kv ] describes research done in collaboration with joseph d.  romano @xcite on the refinement of a formalism developed by geroch @xcite to simplify the einstein equations when the spacetime admits two commuting killing vectors , as is the case with the co - orbiting cosmic string model .",
    "section  [ sec : radbal ] discusses the construction of a stationary radiating solution to a wave equation without the use of external forces by finding a preferred solution containing a balance of incoming and outgoing radiation , the subject of a collaboration with william krivan and richard h.  price @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : cyl ] briefly touches on the concept of describing small - amplitude gravitational radiation as a perturbation not to minkowski spacetime but to the levi - civita solution @xcite for a single cosmic string .",
    "the spacetime of two co - orbiting cosmic strings has two continuous symmetries , which are described by two killing vector fields .",
    "one of these , which we call @xmath5 , represents the combination of time translation and rotation about the orbital axis which leaves the spacetime unchanged .",
    "it can be thought of roughly in terms of traditional cylindrical cordinates as @xmath6 .",
    "the other killing vector simply corresponds to translation along the strings and can be thought of as @xmath7 .    in a numerical determination of the spacetime geometry ,",
    "one seeks to fix the cordinate ( i.e. , gauge ) information completely , and thus calculate the minimum number of quantities necessary to define the geometry .",
    "it is desirable , of course , to choose a gauge which takes advantage of the symmetries of the problem .",
    "following from the example of static , axisymmetric spacetimes @xcite , we might wish to define two killing cordinates @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , supplemented by two other cordinates @xmath11 ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) on a subspace orthogonal to the two killing vectors , and bring the line element into a block - diagonal form @xmath14 for our set of killing symmetries , however , this fails because the symmetry group is not _ orthogonally transitive _ , which means that it is impossible to construct two - surfaces everywhere orthogonal to both killing vector trajectories .",
    "the measure of this failure is a pair of scalar fields @xmath15 given by @xmath16 the co - rotational killing vector @xmath5 is not surface - forming ( @xmath17 ) , which leads to the non - vanishing of @xmath18 , indicating a lack of orthogonal transitivity .",
    "although the metric components in any cordinate basis will have non - vanishing `` cross terms '' @xmath19 between the killing and non - killing directions , it still possible to describe the geometry in terms of two matrices @xmath20 and @xmath21 along with the two scalars @xmath18 and @xmath22 .",
    "this done using a construction due to geroch @xcite which defines a two - manifold @xmath23 of killing vector orbits .",
    "the cordinates @xmath24 are cordinates on this two - manifold , and any tensor on the original four - dimensional spacetime manifold @xmath25 which has vanishing inner products with , and lie derivatives along , the killing vectors corresponds to a tensor on the two - manifold @xmath23 . in particular , the tensors and scalars on @xmath23 which describe the spacetime geometry are    * the symmetric matrix of inner products @xmath26 * the metric on @xmath23 , which has components @xmath21 and corresponds to the projection tensor @xmath27 on @xmath25 ( where @xmath28 is the inverse of @xmath20 ) * the two scalars @xmath29 which define the lack of orthogonal transitivity .    given these objects , it is possible to define a non - cordinate basis on the four - dimensional spacetime by @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "in this basis the metric has components @xmath32 the @xmath15 give the commutation cofficients of the non - commuting basis vectors : @xmath33\\propto \\lambda^{ab}c_a k_b\\,.\\ ] ]      geroch s original paper contained four partial differential equations involving @xmath21 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath18 , and @xmath22 which were equivalent to the vacuum einstein equations @xmath37 .",
    "we have found a streamlined derivation which treats the indexed quantities @xmath38 and @xmath29 as single entities , rather than dealing with each component individually .",
    "we have also derived explicit expressions ( given in @xcite ) for the components @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 which can be used even when the stress - energy tensor is non - vanishing .    in the case",
    "where the off - block - diagonal components @xmath42 of the stress - energy tensor vanish , the einstein equations @xmath43 simply say that the scalars @xmath29 are constants . a convenient choice of gauge in which to solve the remaining six einstein equations is a basis in which @xmath44 these four functions @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 of the two cordinates @xmath49 and @xmath50 provide a fixed gauge in which the problem can be solved numerically .",
    "there are six block - diagonal einstein equations ( for @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) , but only four of them are independent because of the contracted bianchi identities @xmath53 .",
    "these equations will be combined with a treatment of the cosmic string sources and the boundary conditions at infinity and the origin to produce a numerically determined spacetime .",
    "the true physical spacetime which we are ultimately modelling contains gravitational radiation at infinity which is outgoing .",
    "this loss of energy leads to decay of the orbits and inspiral of the compact objects in a non - stationary solution . in many radiative problems ,",
    "a solution with outgoing radiation can be constrained to be stationary by an external force whose agent does not couple to the radiation . however , this is at odds with the idea that in general relativity all matter gravitates , so we should look instead for a solution where there is no net energy loss to infinity due to the radiation . a nave replacement for the outgoing radiation boundary conditions would be a standing wave condition . however , that turns out to be inappropriate , as standing waves require a node ( dirichlet ) or extremum ( neumann ) at a particular location , and a standing wave condition thus fails to converge to a well - defined limit as that location is moved out to infinity .",
    "we have been investigating the question of how to implement a sensible boundary condition leading to a balance of radiation in the context of a simple theory : a nonlinear scalar field @xmath54 in two - plus - one dimensions , where the source @xmath55 and field @xmath56 are required to be co - rotating ( i.e. , depend only on @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "this causes the field equation to take the form @xmath59    in the numerical solution for the non - linear equation ( [ coroteqn ] ) , one uses a finite cordinate grid and specifies a set of boundary conditions at the large finite radius @xmath60 which marks the end of the grid .",
    "table [ tab:1 ]    [ tab:1 ]    .some large - distance boundary conditions . purely ingoing or outgoing radiation has a well - defined limit as the radius @xmath61 at which it is applied",
    "is taken to infinity , but standing wave conditions ( e.g. , neumann or dirichlet ) do not . [ cols=\">,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     shows several possible boundary conditions .",
    "we call , e.g. , the solution resulting from the application of the outgoing boundary condition at a particular @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "the local conditions defining outgoing or ingoing radiation each produce well - defined limits ( which we call simply @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) as @xmath61 is taken to infinity , but the standing wave solutions do not converge to any limit .    taking the average of the @xmath65 limits @xmath63 and",
    "@xmath64 defines a function @xmath66 which has a balance of ingoing and outgoing radiation without reference to any particular radius @xmath61 . in the linear ( @xmath67 ) theory , where the principle of superposition holds",
    ", it is a solution to the field equations , but in the non - linear theory it is not .",
    "it is also not defined as the limit of any local boundary conditions ( in particular , the is average of out- and ingoing solutions is not produced by an average of out- and ingoing boundary conditions ) .",
    "the tasks of defining a solution analogous to @xmath68 and numerically determining that solution in the absence of a local boundary condition can both be accomplished by a green s function method .    if we define a green s function @xmath69 such that @xmath70 the differential equation ( [ coroteqn ] ) can be converted into an integral equation @xmath71    \\ ,    .\\ ] ] solving to the green s function equation ( [ gfeqn ] ) requires the application of boundary conditions at infinity , so there are actually a family of green s functions with boundary conditions `` built into '' them . for example , using the retarded green s function @xmath72 in ( [ nlinteqn ] ) gives the outgoing solution @xmath63 , using the advanced green s function @xmath73 gives the ingoing solution @xmath64 , and similarly for any of the boundary conditions defined at finite radii in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "since the green s function equation ( [ gfeqn ] ) is linear , even when the wave equation ( [ coroteqn ] ) is not , we can always average the retarded and advanced _",
    "green s functions _ to give a time - symmetric green s function @xmath74 which defines a radiation - balanced solution @xmath75 .    in the linear theory ,",
    "this solution @xmath75 will be equal to the average @xmath68 of the ingoing and outgoing solutions .",
    "in the non - linear theory , we can calculate the two numerically ( by iterating ( [ nlinteqn ] ) ) and compare them .",
    "we are ultimately trying to use the outgoing piece of @xmath75 as an approximation for @xmath63 ( and thus as a further approximation for the actual inspiralling solution ) , and we expect that approximation to be good when @xmath76 .",
    "numerical calculations @xcite for a strongly non - linear ( @xmath77 ) theory have shown that the approximation becomes good as the orbital velocity of the sources becomes non - relativistic .",
    "figures [ fig:.25c ] and [ fig:.125c ]    show the comparison between @xmath75 and @xmath68 for orbital velocities of one - fourth and one - eighth the speed of light , respectively .",
    "this agreement occurs even when the theory is highly nonlinear because , even though @xmath64 and @xmath63 differ in the wave zone , they are approximately the same in the inner , strong - field region , as illustrated in figure [ fig : try ] .",
    "the final step in the scalar field theory analysis will be to numerically extract the `` outgoing part '' from the time - symmetric solution @xmath75 and compare it directly to @xmath63 ; we expect that the two will agree when @xmath75 is approximately equal to @xmath68 .",
    "in the three - plus - one binary inspiral problem , with non - extended sources , gravitational waves at infinity can be treated as perturbations to minkowski spacetime .",
    "this is because at large distances , where higher multipoles of the non - radiative field can be ignored , the non - radiative part of the geometry is associated with the schwarzschild metric @xmath78 which contains a length scale @xmath79 ; taking @xmath80 reduces the schwarzschild line element to the minkowski one , which is just another way of saying that the schwarzschild solution is asymptotically flat .    with infinitely extended sources ,",
    "this is not possible .",
    "far from the strings , where the internal structure is not felt , the non - radiative effects are approximated by the levi - civita solution @xcite of a single cosmic string at the origin with mass - per - unit length @xmath81 , whose line element is given for small @xmath81 by @xmath82 the mass parameter @xmath83 is now dimensionless ; this lack of a length scale means that levi - civita spacetime is _ not _ asymptotically flat and we must use levi - civita rather than minkowski as our background metric .",
    "suppose the metric is given by the levi - civita metric plus a small perturbation @xmath84 .",
    "( in our problem the @xmath85 and @xmath86 dependence will further be restricted to a function of @xmath87 , but we are thinking here of more general considerations . ) we can divide the components @xmath88 into those which are odd under inversion of the @xmath89 cordinate ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 ) and those which are even ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 ) . in the linearized theory , the odd and even sectors are uncoupled .    to count the physical degrees of freedom ,",
    "we consider the effects of a gauge transformation @xmath100 by a gauge parameter @xmath101 , as well as the hamiltonian constraint @xmath102 and the three components @xmath103 of the momentum constraint .",
    "the three odd components of the metric perturbation consist of one gauge degree of freedom @xmath104 , one constraint @xmath105 , and one physical degree of freedom , which can be thought of as the `` cross polarization '' ( since it involves @xmath92 ) .",
    "the seven even components include three gauge degrees of freedom @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 , three constraints @xmath102 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , and one physical `` plus polarization '' involving @xmath93 and @xmath99 .",
    "the next step in a treatment akin to that done by moncrief @xcite for waves on a schwarzschild background will be to derive explicit wave equations for these two gauge - invariant physical degrees of freedom .",
    "for the purposes of the quasi - stationary binary inspiral program , it may suffice to work with linearized versions of the gauge - fixed equations derived in @xcite , but the picture of general perturbations to levi - civita will at least be useful in interpreting the quantities involved .",
    "the work described in section  [ sec:2kv ] has produced non - linear differential equations which can be numerically implemented given a suitable treatment of the sources and the boundary conditions on the radiation at the outer boundary .",
    "the study of radiation balance in the context of non - linear scalar field theory in section  [ sec : radbal ] will be completed by the extraction of the outgoing part of the time - symmetric green s function solution and the comparison between that and the actual outgoing solution ( which we expect to be unavailable in the gravitational case ) .",
    "application of these methods to general relativity will be complicated by the fact that it is probably not possible to formulate a ( linear ) green s function solution to the non - linear wave equation in that case .",
    "the analysis of perturbations to levi - civita spacetime described in section  [ sec : cyl ] is still in the early stages , and its full development may or may not be necessary to the understanding of our problem , which possesses the additional co - rotational killing vector .",
    "finally , should the technique of finding a stationary solution with a balance of ingoing and outgoing radiation prove successful in the essentially two - dimensional problem of orbiting cosmic strings , it can be applied to the computationally more intensive three - dimensional problem .",
