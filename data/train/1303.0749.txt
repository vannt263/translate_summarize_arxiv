    "they represent a diverse and rich , but largely unexplored , source of materials .",
    "graphene is the most well - known example.@xcite however , many other layered materials can also be explored .",
    "very recently , significant progress has been made on one type of layered transition metal dichalcogenide , mos@xmath0 . in 2010 , two groups independently discovered an indirect - to - direct bandgap transition that occurs when varying the thickness from bulk to monolayer.@xcite in 2011 , monolayer mos@xmath0 transistors with a 10@xmath3 on / off ratio and a room - temperature mobility of more than 200  @xmath2/vs have been demonstrated.@xcite in 2012 , several groups reported observation of valley selective optical excitation and luminescence in monolayer mos@xmath0.@xcite these studies paved ways to apply two dimensional mos@xmath0 for photonics , electronics , and valleytronics .",
    "studies on _ bulk _ mos@xmath0 can provide complementary information for understanding monolayers and their interaction with environments and substrates , since the properties of monolayer mos@xmath0 are different from , but related to , the bulk . here",
    "we report a transient absorption microscopy study of charge carrier dynamics in bulk mos@xmath0 crystals . by time resolving the dynamics , we observed intervalley transfer , energy relaxation , and recombination of carriers .",
    "furthermore , spatial resolution of carrier dynamics allows us to observe diffusion of carriers , and measure their diffusion coefficients .",
    "these results provide fundamental information on charge carrier dynamics in bulk mos@xmath0 crystals , and can be used to understand carrier dynamics of mos@xmath0 bulk and atomic layers .",

    "a passive mode - locked ti : sapphire laser is used to generate 100-fs pulses with a central wavelength of 780 nm and a repetition rate of 80 mhz .",
    "the output is used to pump an optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) , which has a signal output of 1320 nm and an idler output of 1907 nm .",
    "we take a portion of the 780-nm ti : sapphire output before entering the opo , and combine it with the idler beam of opo . by sending both beams to a beta barium borate ( bbo ) crystal ,",
    "we generate their sum frequency with a central wavelength of 555-nm .",
    "this pulse is focused to the sample surface through a microscope objective lens with a spot size of 1.6 @xmath4 m ( in full width at half maximum ) .",
    "it is used as the pump pulse .",
    "the probe pulse is obtained by second harmonic generation of the 1320 nm signal output of opo in another bbo crystal , with a central wavelength of 660 nm .",
    "it is focused to the sample through the same objective lens , with a spot size of 1.3 @xmath4 m .",
    "the reflected probe is collimated by the objective lens , and is sent to one photodiode of a balanced detector .",
    "a portion of the probe beam is taken before entering the sample , and is sent to the other photodiode of the balanced detector as the reference beam .",
    "the balanced detector outputs a voltage that is proportional to the difference between optical powers on the two photodiodes . in the measurements ,",
    "we first block the pump pulse , and adjust the reference to match the reflected probe power , such that the balanced detector outputs a zero voltage .",
    "we then allow the pump pulse to reach the sample .",
    "it injects carriers , which change the reflection coefficient of the sample for the probe pulse .",
    "hence , the balanced detector now outputs a voltage that is proportional to a differential reflection of the probe , @xmath5 .",
    "it is defined as the relative change of the probe reflection caused by the pump , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the reflection of the probe with the pump presence and without it , respectively .",
    "the advantage of using the balanced detector is to suppress the intensity noise of the probe pulse .",
    "such a common mode noise is equally distributed on the two photodiodes , and hence is almost cancelled . to suppress other types of noise , we use a mechanical chopper to modulate the pump intensity at about 2 khz , and use a lock - in amplifier to read the output of the balanced detector at that frequency . to measure the differential reflection as a function of the probe delay , defined as the time delay of the probe pules with respect to the pump pulse",
    ", we change the length of the pump arm by moving the retroreflector in the pump arm .",
    "the time resolution in these measurements is about 250 fs , since both pulses are about 180 fs at sample , mainly due to dispersion of the objective lens .",
    "to spatially resolve the differential reflection signal , we scan the pump spot with respect to the probe spot at the sample surface by tilting the beamsplitter that reflects the pump into the objective lens .",
    "the mos@xmath0 samples used for this study are natural occurring crystals from spi supplies .",
    "the background carrier density is below @xmath9 /@xmath10 .",
    "the samples were mounted on glass substrates .",
    "the surface of the samples is mechanically cleaved by using an adhesive tape in order to obtain a relative flat , clean , and fresh surface .",
    "all the measurements were performed under ambient conditions .",
    "the bandstructure of mos@xmath0 is plotted schematically in fig .",

    "the pump photon energy of 2.24 ev is large enough to excite electrons near the direct bandgaps at k point , from both @xmath111 and @xmath112 valanced bands to the c1 conduction band .",
    "once excited , the carriers can rapidly transfer to the lower valleys by intervalley scattering .",
    "these carriers then undergo an energy relaxation process , via emitting phonons , to reach thermal equilibrium with the lattice .",
    "finally , the electrons and holes recombine .",
    "the dynamics is detected by using the 660-nm probe , with a photon energy of 1.88 ev , within the a - exciton resonance.@xcite although the probe is resonant with the exciton transition , we do not expect it detects real exciton population .",
    "rather , the probe detects free carriers via carrier - induced nonlinearity at exciton transition.@xcite in bulk mos@xmath0 ,",
    "the exciton binding energy is about 25 mev , which is comparable to thermal energy at room temperature .",
    "@xcite hence , we do not expect a significant exciton population , and ignore their contributions .",
    "in fact , our experimental results also confirm this assumption ( see sec .  [ discussion ] ) .     including the conduction ( c1 ) and valence ( v1 and v2 ) bands .",
    "the vertical green and red arrows illustrate the pump and probe photon energies .",
    "the expected carrier dynamics is also shown , including interband excitation ( 1 ) , intervalley transfer ( 2 ) , energy relaxation ( 3 ) , and interband recombination ( 4).,width=321 ]",
    "in this section , we discuss in detail how to monitor the carrier dynamics with the probe pulse . for the normal incident probe pulse",
    ", the linear reflection coefficient of the unexcited sample can be obtained from snell s law , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the real and imaginary parts of the index of refraction .",
    "the latter , known as the extinction coefficient , is related to the absorption coefficient ( @xmath15 ) and light wavelength ( @xmath16 ) by @xmath17 .",
    "the charge carriers injected by the pump pulse can change the reflection coefficient to @xmath18 since in our measurements the probe pulse is tuned to an excitonic resonance , the absorption is expected to play a dominant role .",
    "hence , we assume real part is unchanged , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . furthermore ,",

    "hence , this condition is safely satisfied , and the differential reflection @xmath26[(n_0 - 1)^2 + \\kappa_0 ^ 2 ] } \\delta \\kappa.\\ ] ]    in our scheme , we probe the injected carriers by saturation of excitonic absorption induced by these carriers . in most cases , excitonic nonlinearities , such as absorption saturation , are induced by real exciton populations via phase - space state filling .",
    "however , it has been established that excitonic transition strength can be changed by the phase - space state filling effect of free carriers , since the exciton wave function is composed of free - carrier states.@xcite although this effects is generally weaker than those caused by exciton population , it is less selective to carrier energy distribution . hence , it can effectively probe carriers with a high kinetic energy .",
    "recently , we have shown that free carrier induced excitonic nonlinearity can be used to probe ballistic transport of hot carriers@xcite and coherent plasma oscillation@xcite in gaas . in this effect , the change in extinction coefficient can be described by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the carrier density , @xmath29 is the saturation density and the cross section @xmath30 is introduced to describe the effectiveness of carriers in saturating the probe transitions .",

    "the on - axis peak energy fluence of the pump pulse , @xmath32 , is related to its time average power , @xmath33 , by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the repetition rate of the laser and @xmath36 is the full width at half maximum of the focused pump spot .",
    "we assume that with each absorbed pump photon , one electron - hole pair is injected .",
    "the on - axis carrier density excited near the sample surface can then be written as @xmath37 where @xmath15 and @xmath38 are the absorption coefficient and energy of the pump photon , respectively .",
    "the lateral distribution of carriers is gaussian , identical to the intensity profile of pump spot . from this procedure",

    "the inset shows the signal near zero probe delay .",
    "clearly , the dynamics has a fast component of less than 1 ps and a slow one persists for several hundred ps .",
    "we attribute the slow process to recombination of carriers , _",
    "i.e. _ carrier lifetime , and the fast process to the dynamical variation of @xmath30 associated with evolution of carrier distribution in the conduction and valence bands . according to the bandstructure of mos@xmath0",
    ", the pump pulse excites electrons from the valance bands to the * k * valley of the conduction band .",
    "since the direct bandgap at * k * point is about 1.84 ev , electrons are excited with an excess energy of about 100 - 200  mev .",
    "the pulse - width limited raising time of the differential reflection signal shows that these excited electrons change the excitonic transition strength immediately .",
    "this is an evidence that exciton formation is negligible , since one would expect a relatively slow rise of signal associated with exciton formation .",
    "since the * q * valley in the conduction band is much lower than the * k * valley , these electrons transfer rapidly to the * q * valley by emitting optical phonons .",
    "we attribute the initial decay of the signal in the first ps , with a time constant of about 0.35 ps , to this intervalley transfer process .",
    "this intervalley transfer time is comparable to electron phonon scattering time of other types of semiconductors ( e.g. gaas).@xcite the * q*-valley electrons still influences the exciton transition , as evidenced by the long - lived signal over 100 ps , but with a smaller cross section .",
    "hence , we attribute the slow dynamics to recombination of carriers in the * q * valley .",
    "since the carrier lifetime is on the order of 100 ps , we can assume that carrier density during the first a few ps is a constant , and equal to the injected density .",
    "we repeat the measurement shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ decay ] with various pump powers ( and hence various injected peak carrier densities ) .",

    "[ decay](a ) ( right axis ) . hence , although the differential reflection is a nonlinear function of the carrier density , we can reliably deduce the latter from the former .",
    "next , we spatially and temporally resolve the differential reflection signal in order to study spatiotemporal dynamics of carriers .",

    "if the mobilities is not a strong function of temperature , hot carriers with larger thermal velocities diffuse faster .",
    "hence , the sub - linear increase of the squared width in the first 50 ps reflects the cooling of carriers , and provide a direct evidence of energy relaxation of hot carriers .",
    "such a hot carrier diffusion has been observed in other types of semiconductors , such as znse.@xcite    the spatiotemporal resolution of the carrier density also allow us to deduce the carrier lifetime .",
