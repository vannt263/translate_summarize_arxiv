    "adsorption of polymers on surfaces plays a key role in numerous technological applications and is also relevant to many biological processes . during the last three decades it has been constantly a focus of research interest .",
    "the theoretical studies of the behavior of polymers interacting with solid substrate have been based predominantly on both scaling analysis  @xcite as well as on the self - consistent field ( scf ) approach  @xcite .",
    "the close relationship between theory and computer experiments in this field@xcite has proved especially fruitful .",
    "most investigations focus as a rule on the determination of the critical adsorption point ( cap ) location and on the scaling behavior of a variety of quantities below , above and at the cap .",
    "thus an eminent relation between polymer statistics and the corresponding correlation functions  @xcite in the @xmath8-vector model of magnets with a free surface in the limit @xmath9 has lead to a number of important results .",
    "special interest has been payed to the determination of the so called _ crossover exponent _",
    "@xmath10 which is known to govern the fraction of adsorbed monomers at the cap .",
    "recently the scaling relationship for a single chain adsorption has been tested by monte carlo ( mc ) simulation on a cubic lattice  @xcite as well as by an off - lattice model  @xcite and the adsorption transition of a polymer could be viewed nowadays as comparatively well understood .    while the investigations mentioned above have been devoted exclusively to homopolymers ,",
    "the adsorption of copolymers ( e.g. multi - blocks or random copolymers ) is still much less understood .",
    "thus , for instance , the cap dependence on block size @xmath1 at fixed concentration of the sticking @xmath2-mers is still unknown as are the scaling properties of _ regular multi - block copolymers _ in the vicinity of the cap . from the theoretical perspective",
    ", the case of diblock copolymers has been studied mainly within the scf - approach  @xcite .",
    "the case of _ random copolymers _ adsorption has gained comparatively more attention by researcher so far .",
    "it has been investigated by whittington et al .",
    "@xcite using both the annealed and quenched models of randomness . in the latter case",
    "the authors implemented the morita approximation ( which is reduced to an optimization problem with a set of constraints involving the moments of the quenched random probability distribution ) .",
    "the influence of sequence correlations on the adsorption of random copolymers has been studied by means of the variational and replica method approach@xcite .",
    "sumithra and baumgaertner  @xcite examined the question of how the critical behavior of random copolymers differs from that of homopolymers .",
    "thus , among a number of important conclusions , the results of monte carlo simulations demonstrated that the crossover exponent @xmath10 ( see below ) is independent of the fraction of attractive monomers @xmath11 .    in the present paper",
    "we use scaling analysis as well as two mc - simulation methods to study the critical behavior of multi - block and random copolymers .",
    "it turns out that the critical behaviour of these two types of copolymers could be reduced to the behavior of an effective homopolymer chain with `` renormalized '' segments . for the multi - block copolymer",
    "this allows e.g. to explain how the critical attraction energy depends on the block length @xmath1 and to derive an adsorption phase diagram in terms of cap against @xmath1 . in the case of random copolymers the sequence of sticky and neutral (",
    "as regards the solid substrate ) monomers within a particular chain is fixed which exemplifies a system with quenched randomness .",
    "nevertheless , close to criticality the chain is still rather mobile , so that the sequence dependence is effectively averaged over the time of the experiment and the problem can be reduced to the case of annealed randomness .",
    "we show that our mc - findings close to criticality could be perfectly treated within the annealed randomness model .",
    "before discussing copolymers adsorption we briefly sketch the scaling theory of homopolymer adsorption  @xcite . it is well known that a single polymer chain undergoes a transition from a non - bound into an adsorbed state when the adsorption energy @xmath12 per monomer increases beyond a critical value @xmath13 .",
    "here and in what follows @xmath12 is measured in units of the thermal energy @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 being the boltzmann constant , ane @xmath16 - the temperature of the system ) .",
    "the adsorption transition can be interpreted as a second - order phase transition at the critical point ( cap ) of adsorption @xmath17 in the thermodynamical limit , i.e. @xmath18 . close to the cap the number of surface contacts @xmath19 scales as @xmath20 .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath10 is somewhat controversial and lies in a range between @xmath21 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath22 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we adopt however the value @xmath23 which has been suggested as the most satisfactory@xcite by comparison with comprehensive simulation results .    consider a chain tethered to the surface at the one end .",
    "the fraction of monomers on the surface @xmath24 may be viewed as an order parameter measuring the degree of adsorption . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath25",
    ", the fraction @xmath11 goes to zero ( @xmath26 ) for @xmath27 , then near @xmath13 , @xmath28 , and for @xmath29 ( in the strong coupling limit ) @xmath11 it is independent of @xmath3 .",
    "let us measure the distance from the cap by the dimensionless quantity @xmath30 and also introduce the scaling variable @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding scaling ansatz is then @xmath32 with the scaling function @xmath33 the resulting scaling behavior of @xmath11 follows as , @xmath34      the gyration radius in direction perpendicular to the surface , @xmath35 , has the form @xmath36 one may determine the form of the scaling function @xmath37 from the following consideration . at @xmath38",
    "one has @xmath39 , so that @xmath40 . in the opposite limit",
    "@xmath41 the @xmath3-dependence drops out and @xmath42 .",
    "thus @xmath43 as a result @xmath44",
    "the gyration radius in direction parallel to the surface has similar scaling representation : @xmath45 again at @xmath38 the gyration radius @xmath46 and @xmath47 . at @xmath41",
    "the chain behaves as a two - dimensional self - avoiding walk ( saw ) , i.e. @xmath48 , where @xmath49 denotes the flory exponent in two dimensions . in result",
    ", the scaling function behaves as @xmath50 thus @xmath51      in the limit @xmath52 the adsorbed chain can be visualized as a string of _ adsorption blobs _ which forms a pancake - like quasi - two - dimensional layer on the surface .",
    "the blobs are defined to contain as many monomers @xmath53 as necessary to be on the verge of being adsorbed and therefore carry an adsorption energy of the order of @xmath54 each .",
    "the thickness of the pancake @xmath55 corresponds to the size of the blob and the chain conformation within a blob stays unperturbed ( i.e. it is simply a saw ) , thus @xmath56 where we have used eq  [ perp ] .",
    "the gyration radius can be represented thus as @xmath57 and one goes back to eq  [ parall ] which proves the consistency of the adsorption blob picture . generally speaking , the number of blobs , @xmath58 , is essential for the main scaling argument in the above - mentioned scaling functions .",
    "for example we could recast the order parameter scaling behavior eq  [ scaling_first ] as @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes a new scaling function : @xmath61      the study of the ratio , @xmath62 , of gyration radius components is a convenient way to find the value of @xmath13 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , from the previous scaling equations @xmath63 hence at the critical point , i.e. at @xmath64 , the ratio @xmath65 is independent of @xmath3 .",
    "thus by plotting @xmath66 vs. @xmath12 for different @xmath3 all such curves should intersect at a single point which gives @xmath13 .    another way to fix @xmath13 is the following .",
    "exactly at the critical point @xmath28 , so that by plotting @xmath67 vs. @xmath3 at different values of @xmath12 one can determine the value @xmath68 under which @xmath67 becomes independent of @xmath3 .",
    "the adsorption on a surface at @xmath69 is due to a free energy gain which is proportional to the number of blobs , i.e. , @xmath70 the expression for the specific heat per monomer follows immediately from eq  [ free_energy ] as @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "note that a factor of @xmath14 is absorbed in the free energy throughout the paper . if @xmath73 then @xmath74 and the specific heat undergoes a jump at the cap ( cf .",
    "section  [ op_variance ] ) .",
    "for a chain ( of the length @xmath3 ) on the verge of adsorption , the foregoing free energy gain , @xmath75 , should be of the order of unity . in view of eq  [ free_energy ]",
    "this gives an estimate for the critical energy of adsorption - cap , @xmath76 where we have explicitly marked the cap , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , for finite and infinitely long chains respectively .",
    "consider now the adsorption of a regular multi - block copolymer which is built up from monomers @xmath2 which attract ( stick ) to the substrate and monomers @xmath79 which are neutral to the substrate . in order to treat the adsorption of a regular multi - block @xmath0 - copolymer we reduce the problem to that of a homopolymer which has been considered above .",
    "the idea is that a regular multi - block copolymer can be considered as a `` homopolymer '' where a single @xmath0-diblock plays the role of an effective monomer  @xcite .",
    "for such a mapping we first estimate the effective energy of adsorption per diblock .",
    "each individual diblock is made up of an attractive @xmath2-block of length @xmath1 and a neutral @xmath79-block of the same length @xmath1 .",
    "upon adsorption the attractive @xmath2-block forms a string of blobs whereas the @xmath79-part forms a non - adsorbed tail ( or loop ) - ( see figure  [ tail ] ) .",
    "the @xmath2 - part forms a string of quasi - two dimensional blobs and the @xmath79-part is neutral regarding the substrate and its contribution to the free energy is of pure entropical nature . ]",
    "the free energy gain of the attractive block may be written according to eq  [ free_energy ] as @xmath80 where we measure the energy in units of @xmath54 and @xmath81 measures the normalized distance from the cap @xmath82 of a homopolymer .",
    "the neutral @xmath79-part which is most frequently a loop connecting adjacent @xmath2-blocks , but could also be a tail with the one end free , contributes only to the entropy loss @xmath83 where the universal exponents @xmath84 and @xmath85 are well known@xcite ( e.g. in 3@xmath86 - space @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) . in case that also the tails are involved , one should also use the exponent @xmath89 albeit this does not change qualitatively the expression eq  [ gamma ] .",
    "they enter the partition function expressions for a free chain , a chain with both ends fixed at a two points , and for a chain , tethered by the one end  @xcite . in result",
    "the effective adsorption energy of a diblock is @xmath90      now we consider a homopolymer which is build up from effective units ( diblocks ) , with the attractive energy given by eq  [ attraction ] .",
    "let us denote the total number of such effective units by @xmath91 .",
    "the fraction of effective units on the surface obeys then the same scaling law as given by eq  [ scaling_first ] , i.e. , @xmath92 where now @xmath93 with the critical adsoption energy @xmath94 of the renormalized homopolymer .",
    "generally , one would expect @xmath94 to be of the order of @xmath82 albeit for different models both critical energies would probably differ from each other .",
    "eq  [ fraction_phi ] is accurate if one require that ( i ) @xmath95 but @xmath96 such that @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and ( ii ) @xmath99 .",
    "the effective attraction @xmath100 of a segment of the renormailzed chain now depends on @xmath1 according to eq  [ attraction ] .    within each effective unit",
    "only @xmath101 @xmath2-monomers will be adsorbed at criticality whereby this monomer number scales as @xmath102 with @xmath81 .",
    "the total number of adsorbed monomer is given by @xmath103 it follows that the fraction @xmath104 where we have used the scaling law , eq  [ fraction_phi ] , for the effective units .",
    "hence , the final expression for the order parameter can be written as follows : @xmath105 thus we have expressed the order parameter @xmath11 of a multi - block copolymer in terms of the chain length @xmath3 , the block length @xmath1 , the monomer attraction energy @xmath12 as well as the model - dependent homopolymer critical attraction energy @xmath82 .",
    "let us consider now some limiting cases .      at the cap of the multiblock chain one has @xmath106",
    ", thus one can estimate the deviation @xmath107 , of the corresponding critical energy of adsorption , @xmath108 , from that of a homopolymer , namely @xmath109 where we have used eq  [ attraction ] and set @xmath73 . under this condition the second @xmath110 -function in eq  [ order_parameter ] is a constant , i.e. , @xmath111 . on the other hand , with respect to a single effective unit the chain stays far from the criticality because of @xmath112 . in this case",
    "the first @xmath110 - function in eq  [ order_parameter ] behaves as @xmath113 where @xmath107 now is fixed by eq  [ kappa_vs_m ] . in result ,",

    "the mapping looks as follows : @xmath119 thus the gyration radius component in direction perpendicular to the surface becomes @xmath120 in the strong adsorption limit @xmath116 and @xmath121 , which yields @xmath122^{2 \\nu } } \\label{copoly_perp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in a similar manner , the gyration radius component parallel to the surface has the form @xmath123 which in the limit @xmath116 results in @xmath124^{2(\\nu_2 - \\nu ) } } { m^{\\nu_2 - \\nu } } \\ : n^{\\nu_2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    like in the homopolymer case , one can define a blob length @xmath125 which in the strong adsorption limit , @xmath126 , approaches the block length , @xmath127 , as it should be .    also in the limit of strong adsorption , @xmath116 , the ratio @xmath128 leads to the correct scaling in terms of number of blobs .",

    "the main focus of the present investigation has been aimed at the adsorption transition of random and regular multiblock copolymers on a rigid substrate .",
    "we have used two different models to establish an unambiguous picture of the adsorption transition and to test scaling predictions at criticality .",
    "the first one is an off - lattice coarse - grained bead - spring model of polymer chains which interact with a structureless surface by means of a contact potential , once an @xmath2-monomer comes close enough to be captured by the adsorption potential . the second one deals with saw on a cubic lattice by the pruned - enriched rosenbluth method ( perm ) which is very efficient , especially for very long polymer chains , and provides high accuracy of the simulation results at criticality .",
    "notwithstanding their basic difference , both methods suggest a consistent picture of the adsorption of copolymers on a rigid substrate and confirm the theoretical predictions even though the particular numeric values of the critical adsorption potential ( cap ) are model - specific and differ considerably .    as a central result of the present work",
    ", one should point out the phase diagram of regular multiblock adsorption which gives the increase of the critical adsorption potential @xmath108 with decreasing length @xmath1 of the adsorbing blocks .",
    "for very large block length , @xmath290 , we find that the cap approaches systematically that of a homogeneous polymer .",
    "we demonstrate also that the phase diagram , derived from computer experiment within the framework of two different models , agrees well with the theoretical prediction based on scaling considerations .",
    "the phase diagram for random copolymers with quenched disorder which gives the change in the critical adsorption potential , @xmath286 , with changing percentage of the sticking @xmath2-monomers , @xmath138 , is also determined from extensive computer simulations carried out with the two models .",
    "we observe perfect agreement with the theoretically predicted result which has been derived by treating the adsorption transition in terms of the `` annealed disorder '' approximation .",
    "we show that a consistent picture of how some basic polymer chain properties of interest such as the gyration radius components perpendicular and parallel to the substrate , or the fraction of adsorbed monomers at criticality , scale when a chain undergoes an adsorption transition appears regardless of the particular simulation approach .",
    "an important conclusion thereby concerns the value of the universal crossover exponent @xmath284 which is found to remain unchanged , regardless whether homo- , regular multiblock- , or random polymers are concerned .",
