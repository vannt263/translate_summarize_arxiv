    "the ` microquasar ' grs 1915 + 105 is one of the most celebrated and widely - studied astrophysical objects of recent years .",
    "the system is extremely luminous and variable in both hard and soft x - rays ( e.g. foster et al .",
    "1996 ; morgan , remillard & greiner 1997 ; belloni et al .",
    "2000 ) and is a source of relativistic jets observed on arcsec and milliarcsec angular scales ( mirabel & rodrguez 1994 , hereafter mr94 ; fender et al . 1999 , hereafter f99 ; rodrguez & mirabel 1999 , hereafter rm99 ; dhawan , mirabel & rodrguez 2000 ) .",
    "sams , eckart & sunyaev ( 1996 ) have reported extended infrared emission from grs 1915 + 105 , but its relation to the radio ejections is at present unclear .",
    "x - ray dips on timescales of minutes have been interpreted by belloni et al .",
    "( 1997a , b ) as the repeated disappearance and refill of the inner accretion disc , possibly due to extremely rapid transitions between ` canonical ' black hole accretion states ( belloni et al . 2000 ) .",
    "pooley & fender ( 1997 ; hereafter pf97 ) reported radio oscillations associated with such dips , and fender et al .",
    "( 1997 ; hereafter f97 ) discovered infrared analogs of these oscillations .",
    "the flat spectrum and correlated radio : infrared behaviour suggested that nonthermal synchrotron emission extended from the radio to the infrared regimes , the first time such high - frequency synchrotron emission had been observed from an x - ray binary ( f97 ) . combined with the unstable accretion disc model of belloni et al .",
    "( 1997a , b ) we suggested that a fraction of the inner disc was being repeatedly accelerated and ejected from the system ( f97 ; pf97 ) .",
    "eikenberry et al . (",
    "1998a ) confirmed the association between x - ray and infrared events , and mirabel et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter m98 ) clearly observed the correlation between x - ray , infrared and radio behaviour in the source .",
    "additional simultaneous observations ( fender & pooley 1998 , hereafter fp98 ) showed a very clear correlation between sequences of oscillations at radio and infrared wavelengths .",
    "delays between different radio bands ( pf97 ; m98 ) and between the infrared and radio bands ( m98 ; fp98 ) clearly indicate that optical depth effects play an important role in the observed emission from these ejections .",
    "eikenberry et al . ( 1998b ) showed that infrared emission line strengths vary in proportion to the continuum during oscillations .",
    "a single x - ray dip , spectrally associated with the temporary disappearance of the inner accretion disc , was also found to coincide with a small radio flare ( feroci et al .",
    "more recently eikenberry et al . ( 2000 ) report faint infrared flares whose association with the x - ray behaviour is uncertain , and ogley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) report significant flux from grs 1915 + 105 at sub - millimetre wavelengths .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 was observed simultaneously on 1999 may 20 with the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) and the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) , both located on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 was observed with ircam3 in the infrared k - band ( @xmath3 m ) on 1999 may 20 , simultaneously with the longer duration of jcmt scuba observations ( see below ) .",
    "data reduction and calibration were performed with iraf , along the lines described in f97 .",
    "five clear oscillation events were detected .",
    "the _ undereddened _ infrared flux densities reached 25 mjy at the peak of the oscillations , the largest amplitude oscillations reported to date in the infrared .",
    "the data are plotted in figs 1 & 2 , dereddened by @xmath4 mag ( f97 ; this value is still rather uncertain ) .      the 1350 @xmath5 m detector of the scuba instrument ( holland et al .",
    "1999 ) on jcmt was used in the photometry .",
    "each integration lasted approximately 4 min .",
    "calibration of the flux - density scale used observations of mars and uranus .",
    "the airmass ranged from 1.01 to 1.92 during the observations , and the optical depth at 1350 @xmath5 m was less than 0.2 throughout .",
    "the data are plotted in figs 1 & 2 .      in order to piece together the composite radio  mm",
    " infrared spectrum of the source at the epoch of our observations , we have utilised radio data from two different monitoring programs .",
    "firstly we have used public data at 2.3 & 8.3 ghz from the green bank interferometer ( gbi ) monitoring program ( e.g. waltman et al .",
    "observations at 15 ghz with the ryle telscope ( rt , e.g. pf97 ) reveal strong oscillations for at least 9 days before and 2 days after the simultaneous ukirt / jcmt observations ( fig 3 ) , with a slowly rising trend in mean level and amplitude .",
    "the jcmt observations reveal a sequence of 15 millimetre - wavelength oscillations with a quasi - period of @xmath6 min .",
    "four of the oscillations have been observed simultaneously in the near - infrared , and both the ( dereddened ) near infrared and mm oscillations have an amplitude of 300350 mjy .",
    "these are by far the largest amplitude oscillations ever observed from grs 1915 + 105 , including radio wavelengths ( see e.g. pf97 for ` typical ' radio oscillations ) .",
    "there is no detectable delay between the emission at the two wavelengths , to the time resolution of the jcmt data , @xmath7 min .",
    "f97 , m98 and fp98 all report infrared oscillations of comparable amplitude ( when dereddened by @xmath4 mag ) to radio oscillations observed around the same time .",
    "although radio observations were not made strictly simultaneously with these mm / infrared observations , monitoring with the rt clearly reveals radio oscillations , with a comparable quasi - period of @xmath8 min , to have been occurring for at least two days before and afterwards ( fig 3 ) .",
    "however , the amplitude of the mm and infrared oscillations is about _ five times _ greater than that observed at radio wavelengths .",
    "the mean radio  infrared spectrum for the four - day period illustrated in fig 3 is shown in fig 4 .",
    "a striking feature of the light curves in figs 1 & 2 is the infrared oscillation which starts around mjd 51318.59 which does not appear to have a mm counterpart , unlike the other four simultaneously observed events .",
    "we have carefully checked the data reduction techniques to see if this was due to human error , but found no evidence of this .",
    "we have no clear physical intepretation of this phenomena , except to suggest that it was due to strong and variable absorption which only signficantly affected the lower - frequency emission ( for example the optical depth to free - free absorption , @xmath9 ) . as noted above , the overall radio  mm  infrared spectrum at the time of these observations ( fig 4 ) was steeper than previously observed , perhaps also indicative of some absorption .",
    "if this is a correct interpretation of the ` failed ' mm event , then we would have expected the radio emission to have been completely absorbed at this time also .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the radiative luminosity of these oscillations is large  for a flat spectrum of amplitude 300 mjy from 1 ghz to @xmath10 ghz ( @xmath11 m ) , at a distance of 11 kpc , it is @xmath12 erg s@xmath2 ( the time - averaged radiative luminosity is around half this value ) .",
    "as is the case for all synchrotron emitting plasmas for which adiabatic expansion losses dominate , this is likely to be a significant underestimate of the power being supplied to the jet .",
    "furthermore we assume the emission arises in a partially self - absorbed jet which retains the same power - law distribution of electrons ( i.e. @xmath13 where @xmath14 ) as observed in optically thin ejections ( f99 ) .",
    "in this situation the flat spectrum is produced by a conical , partially self - absorbed jet ( e.g. blandford & knigl 1979 ; reynolds 1982 ) .",
    "in addition several factors which can further affect the energy budget are uncertain , in particular whether or not the small ejections share the same bulk relativistic motions as the larger ejections , whether each radiating electron has an associated cold proton , and what the filling factor ( ie . the effective volume ) of",
    "the ejecta is .",
    "the procedure for calculating the energy and mass of the ejections is as follows :    * transform observed flux densities and frequencies back to their rest frame ( identical if no bulk relativistic motion ) .",
    "* integrate rest - frame luminosity . *",
    "calculate maximum emitting volume  in this case based on the five - minute rise time this is @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "the effective emitting volume is this volume multiplied by a ` filling factor ' , @xmath17 .",
    "* from the volume , spectrum and luminosity , calculate equipartition magnetic field , and corresponding minimum internal energy . * for baryonic case ,",
    "add one proton for each electron .",
    "* for cases with bulk relativistic motion , add in kinetic energy and multiply by two , under the assumption that observed emission was dominated by one ( approaching ) component only . *",
    "divide by repetition quasi - period of oscillations to obtain time averaged energy and mass outflow rate .",
    "we have tabulated results for different cases in table 1 ; for bulk relativistic motion we have used the doppler factors corresponding to @xmath18 , @xmath19 from f99 .",
    "a significant constraint is that the lack of evidence for synchrotron losses ( based on the similarity of decay rates at widely different wavelengths ) at 2.2@xmath5 m on a timescale of @xmath20 min , implies that @xmath21 g. for bulk motions with doppler factor @xmath22 , this limit is shifted slightly to @xmath23 which , for @xmath24 in this case means the limiting field is @xmath25 g , instead of @xmath26 g , not a major difference .",
    "thus while reducing the emitting volume via the filling factor ( see table 1 ) decreases the minimum energy , the stronger derived equipartition magnetic field is irreconcilable with the observed minimum lifetimes .",
    "as already noted in f97 , a field of order 10 g will cause a cut - off in the spectrum of the oscillations around the optical band . reducing the magnetic field below the equipartition value results in the internal energy being dominated by the electrons , for which total energy @xmath27 .",
    "because of this constraint , the realistic minimum energy can not be reduced much below the value for a non - relativistic non - baryonic ejection with filling factor @xmath28 , which is @xmath29 erg , with a corresponding time - averaged power requirement of @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "this corresponds to a radiative efficiency for the outflow of @xmath30% .",
    "this minimum power requirement is not strongly affected by our assumption of the spectral form of the electron distribution ( e.g. for @xmath31 the minimum power is reduced by only a factor of three ) . only in the case of baryonic ejections at high velocities",
    "does the large number of lower energy electrons become significant , as each has an associated proton . as a result",
    "it does not matter whether the emission arises in a discrete ` plasmon ' or an internal shock in a quasi - steady flow .",
    "it is interesting to compare the power for baryonic ejections with @xmath32 , @xmath33 erg s@xmath2 , with that calculated for the same criteria for the ` major ' ejections in f99 , @xmath34 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "this is due to the observed optically thin cm spectrum , @xmath35 , being assumed in f99 to have no high - frequency excess , and therefore a much lower integrated luminosity than the flat spectrum oscillations reported here .",
    "further prompt mm and infrared observations during ` major ' outbursts are required to investigate this .",
    "m98 have shown that the wavelength - dependent time delays ( radio  radio and radio  infrared ) observed from grs 1915 + 105 can be approximated by a ` van der laan ' ( 1996 ) model for an expanding plasmon . however , as discussed in fp98 such a model does not well describe the observed flat spectrum , which seems instead to be better modelled by a partially self - absorbed conical jet of the type developed for agn ( e.g. blandford & knigl 1979 ; reynolds 1982 ) .",
    "more recently kaiser , sunyaev & spruit ( 2000 ) have further applied a internal shock model to the major 1994 radio outburst of the source reported in mr94 . in their model",
    "they require approximately the same amount of energy to be associated with the events as calculated for a plasmon model in mr94 , but the _ power _ requirement is less as they spread the energy input over a much longer period .",
    "however , with repeated oscillations as observed here , this can not be the case , where an entire accretion ",
    "ejection cycle is repeated on the timescale of @xmath8 min which we have used to calculate @xmath36 and @xmath37 in table 1 .",
    "therefore this model can not be used to evade the enormous amount of continuous power required to generate the observed repeated ejection events ( this is not an argument against their model , but one against using it to evade the huge power requirements ) . importantly , unless ( a ) there is a bright mm  infrared contribution from the large ejections which has not to date been observed , and ( b ) it is only the spatially resolved ejections ( f99 ; rm99 ) which have bulk relativistic motion and a baryonic content , then _",
    "grs 1915 + 105 injects more energy and matter into the outflow during periods of repeated small events than it does during the large ejections . _",
    "note also that belloni , migliari & fender ( 2000 ) have found that jet power , calculated as above , appears to be anticorrelated with accretion rate as inferred from x - ray spectral fits , for a small sample of observations with quasi - simultaneous infrared and x - ray coverage .",
    "we have reported giant repeated oscillation events from the black hole system grs 1915 + 105 observed simultaneously at mm and infrared wavelengths .",
    "contemporaneous radio observations indicate that these observations were near the end of a sequence of @xmath38 days of oscillations with @xmath8-min quasi - periods ( i.e. @xmath39 discrete ejection events ) .",
    "we have investigated in depth the energy and mass flow associated with such events , seeking to minimize the very large required power .",
    "however the magnetic field has an upper limit imposed by the lack of observed radiation losses in the infrared band , so that reducing the effective volume by means of a small filling factor can not significantly reduce the required power .",
    "given the repeated nature of the events , and their almost certain association to an accretion cycle , we can not spread the minimum required energy over a longer timescale than the repetition quasi - period . as a result we find that at least @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 is required to be channelled into the formation of the ejecta ; a very significant fraction of the accretion energy unless the black hole is very massive indeed . the enormous energy budget associated with baryonic ejections at bulk",
    "relativistic velocities may rule out this possibility , although at present we do not know which is more unlikely : no baryons or low velocity ejections .",
