    "in qcd , the chiral condensate is important as it is the order parameter of chiral symmetry breaking . as such , its behavior is key in understanding qcd in extreme conditions .",
    "finite temperature and pressure effects have been studied extensively . on the other hand ,",
    "comparatively few efforts have focused on the effects of finite electromagnetic fields .",
    "prior studies have been done either using chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath5pt)@xcite , the effective theory for low - energy qcd , or models compatible with the large-@xmath6 expansion@xcite ( the njl model , in particular@xcite ) .",
    "the method used in this paper is @xmath5pt .",
    "this approach has the advantage of being model - independent and systematic , but has the disadvantage of containing a number of undetermined parameters ( low - energy constants or lecs ) .",
    "we extend prior work done at the @xmath7 limit @xcite and at one loop @xcite to two loops for @xmath8 .",
    "other calculations using @xmath5pt have focused on @xmath3 , and while this may be of interest theoretically , it has at best a narrow window of validity@xcite . in addition , it is unlikely to find in nature a real electric or magnetic field with @xmath9 or @xmath10 , which is required for the approximation to be reasonable . incidentally , the opposite limit , @xmath11 , might be of more interest in the sense that it can be produced in the laboratory , but in such a regime the shift in the condensate is miniscule .    continuing a calculation to higher orders in an expansion is always of interest at least in the trivial sense of finding a more precise result . in this case",
    ", large-@xmath6 qcd@xcite provides another possible motivation for why the @xmath0 result might be of interest .",
    "low - energy constants ( lecs ) of the same chiral order will have different orders of @xmath6 , depending upon the number of flavor traces in the term they multiply .",
    "this can be understood as follows : a flavor trace corresponds to a quark loop in the analogous qcd calculation , and large-@xmath6 counting rules indicate quark loops are down by a power of @xmath6 , and the lec is the only parameter available to absorb this difference .",
    "this large-@xmath6 dependence of the lecs can provide hints to the convergence of the chiral expansion .",
    "there are several processes which have been calculated at two - loop order , most of which show a close match between the @xmath0 results and the experimental results @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 correction required to achieve this agreement varies , but in particular , the @xmath0 calculation of the process @xmath12 is strikingly more accurate than the @xmath13 result@xcite .",
    "this is also the process which provides a ( very rough ) estimate of the lec we use here , so it is conceivable that the @xmath0 correction will be important in our case , as well .",
    "we will first proceed with a brief overview of @xmath1 @xmath5pt .",
    "we then follow with an analytical calculation of the shift in the chiral condensate due to a magnetic field at @xmath0 , and finally , a numerical analysis of the shift for general electromagnetic fields .",
    "this section is a brief summary of the chiral perturbation theory notation that will be used in this paper . for a detailed description of the theory , see the original papers by gasser and leutwyler@xcite or a number of reviews(refs .",

    "treatment of the chiral lagrangian to @xmath0 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the building blocks that are used to construct the chiral lagrangian include @xmath14 , containing the dynamical pion fields , and external fields @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "we will consider here @xmath1 flavor symmetry with @xmath19 , with external fields corresponding to only a constant electromagnetic field and quark masses .",

    "this lagrangian has been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and has more terms than we will list ( 112 for @xmath22 and 53 for @xmath1 ) .",
    "fortunately , only one of these ( in @xmath1 ) will be relevant for our calculation , as we will see later , and it can be expressed as : @xmath36      renormalization of the theory to @xmath13 was calculated in ref .",
    "it has also more recently been calculated for the @xmath0 lagrangian in @xcite .",
    "using the @xmath1 lecs , the renormalized couplings can be written : @xmath37 when @xmath38 , these can be expressed in terms of scale - independent parameters as : @xmath39 the renormalization of the @xmath4 term that we will be using later can be expressed similarly in terms of the renormalized lecs from @xmath31 as @xmath40",
    "the term in the qcd lagrangian which is relevant to @xmath41 is @xmath42 . since we know that @xmath43 , in the isospin limit of @xmath44 we can calculate the condensate from the vacuum energy as @xmath45 to first order in @xmath46 , the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation @xmath47@xcite applies , and can be used to calculate the shift in the condensate .",
    "unfortunately , we will need the next order result , which will introduce some ambiguity as follows .",
    "neither the chiral condensate or the quark mass can be defined independently ; only their product has a physical meaning . in the language of @xmath5pt@xcite , @xmath48 the ambiguity here is codified in the unphysical lec @xmath49 , which will vary according to the renormalization convention .",
    "this is an ambiguity in the definition of @xmath41 . in order to avoid this difficulty",
    ", we choose to normalize our results according to the quantity @xmath50 , which we define by @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 at their physical values .",
    "we will thus express our results in terms of @xmath54 , where @xmath55 .",
    "as we will see , this ratio is unambiguous at the order to which we work .",
    "we will also need the relationships between @xmath56 and @xmath53 as well as @xmath57 and @xmath52 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the difference between the lowest - order @xmath13 result and the @xmath59 result is @xmath60 ; we therefore only need one order of corrections@xcite : @xmath61 \\\\f_\\pi = & f\\left[1 + \\frac{m^2}{16\\pi^2f^2}\\bar{l}_4 + { \\cal o}(m^4)\\right ] .",

    "as described above , we can accomplish this by calculating the vacuum energy to the same order . as noted by ref .",
    "@xcite , this calculation will involve two - loop diagrams with @xmath30 vertices , one - loop diagrams with an @xmath31 vertex , and tree - level diagrams with an @xmath4 vertex .",

    "@xcite .",
    "equations  ( [ eqn : hshift ] ) and ( [ eqn : ehshift ] ) are the principal results of this work .",
    "because the behavior of the theory is encoded in the lecs , a real - world interpretation of the low - energy behavior requires the use of measured lecs . for the @xmath31 lecs ,",
    "this is straightforward , as these are individually determined with relatively small error . on the other hand , @xmath4 lecs , such as @xmath67 , are more problematic , as there are in general many more lecs than easily measurable processes to determine them .",
    "these lecs are often estimated ( at a particular scale ) by resonance exchange .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath67 in particular is difficult to extract , as the resonance processes to which it contributes involve only scalar exchange , and because it appears squared in these processes , its sign is undetermined .",
    "this resonance exchange occurs at a scale @xmath112@xcite , and it is the ( scale - dependent ) value determined by experiment that has an undetermined sign .",
    "the scale - independent @xmath113 is positive in both cases .",

    "@xcite to extract the principal value of the integral numerically .",
    "we remove the singularities due to the poles located at @xmath119 with residue @xmath120 by subtracting the expression @xmath121 the principal value of the integral of this expression is zero , but it has a singularity at @xmath119 which exactly cancels the singular behavior of the integrand in @xmath122 .    using this method , we plot the total shift in the condensate up to @xmath0 from a general @xmath72 and @xmath73 field in fig .  [ fig : totval ] , and in fig .  [ fig : fracval ] , we plot the ratio of the added correction at @xmath0 to the total shift . in these plots",
    ", we have included a shaded region to indicate the possible values for the shift based on a range for @xmath118 of @xmath123 .",
    "the asymptotic expression for the shift as @xmath124 ( for an @xmath73 field , which also provides some qualitative insight to other cases ) is @xmath125 which is , of course , zero for @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "this expression encodes low - energy behavior for a more realistic regime , ; namely , that of the actual pion mass and a very small magnetic field .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : fracval ] and in ( [ eqn : asymshift ] ) that the ( unknown ) sign of @xmath118 has a profound impact on the importance of the @xmath0 calculation .",
    "the shift in the condensate for a positive @xmath118 is significant enough even as @xmath128 , whereas the shift for a negative one is negligible up to large values of @xmath129 .    .",
    "another notable feature is that the contribution to the imaginary part is larger at @xmath0 order as a pure @xmath73 field is approached ( while the total imaginary part is going to zero ) . except in this case",
    "where the total imaginary part is negligible , the fraction of the imaginary part at two loops will be much less significant than its real counterpart in regimes where the chiral expansion would be expected to converge ( @xmath130 or below ) .    the calculation as a whole will only be valid when the real part is significantly larger than the imaginary part .",
    "when the imaginary part dominates , the system will break down due to the instability from pair creation .",
    "we have studied the shift in the chiral condensate due to an electromagnetic field using chiral perturbation theory , which is a powerful tool for analyzing the low - energy behavior of qcd .",
    "our analysis was done at @xmath0 with @xmath131 .",
    "it is obvious that the inclusion of a nonzero pion mass greatly affects the result .",
    "the importance of the @xmath0 correction is less clear .",
    "large-@xmath6 reasoning coupled with the results of model - based calculations give circumstantial evidence that it could play an important role in the final result .",
    "however , because the sign of the relevant lec at @xmath4 is undetermined by experiment , its effect at @xmath0 could be significant or virtually irrelevant .",
