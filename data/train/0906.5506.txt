    "there has been a lot of interest in the study of asymptotic shape of growing clusters .",

    ", it has been shown that the asymptotic shape of the growing cluster is not a perfect circle  @xcite .",
    "the shape of growing clusters has also been studied in sandpile models . in the abelian sandpile model , in two dimensions in an initial background of @xmath7 particles at each lattice site @xcite , it was found that the cluster in general has a convex asymptotic shape , which becomes more circular as @xmath7 is decreased , and tends to a perfect circle as @xmath8 .    in this paper",
    ", we study the eulerian walker ( ew ) model on the square lattice .",

    "@xcite as a simpler variant of the sandpile model of self - organized criticality ( soc )  @xcite .",
    "it has subsequently found applications in design of derandomized simulations of markov chains  @xcite , efficient information transfer protocols in computer networks  @xcite , and modelling coevolution of virus and immune systems  @xcite .",
    "we study the model , starting from a disordered background , by monte carlo simulations .",
    "we have a single walker that moves on the lattice and we look at the shape of region visited by it which grows with the length @xmath0 of the walk .",
    "interestingly , we find evidence that this region is asymptotically a perfect circle .",
    "the circular shape is reminiscent of the circular shape in the rotor - router aggregation model studied by propp ( see @xcite ) , where , for a special initial configuration , the region is almost a perfect circle  @xcite with departures from the circle being of order 1 .",
    "the circular shape for the ew cluster is not very evident for small walks .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we have shown clusters formed by the ew of @xmath9 and @xmath10 steps . clearly , only for large @xmath0 , does the circular shape start to emerge , and it requires careful statistical analysis to see this when @xmath0 is not so large .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=216 ]    the ew model can also be looked upon as a particular limit of a growing self repelling walk , in which the walker preferably jumps along a bond which has been visited least number of times so far .",
    "this model was studied in @xmath16 by toth and veto  @xcite . in the zero temperature limit , in one specific variant , this becomes the ew model and a finite temperature corresponds to noise .",
    "it was found that the number of visits at a distance @xmath17 from the origin satisfies the scaling function @xmath18 .",
    "we find that the same scaling function holds even in @xmath19 .",

    "[ sec : case1 ] , we give details of the simulation without noise ( i.e. @xmath22 ) .",
    "we find that the asymptotic shape of lines of constant average number of visits by an ew are perfectly circular , within statistical errors .",
    "we will argue that the variance of average number of visit at any distance from the origin tends to a finite number for large @xmath0 and also obtain the scaling function for the average number of visits . in sec .",

    "the eulerian walker is defined as follows : we consider a square lattice .",
    "we associate with each site an arrow which can point to along one of the four directions , denoted by n , e , s and w ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) . in the initial configuration ,",
    "the direction of the arrow at each site is chosen independently , and with equal probability .",
    "we put a walker at the origin which moves on the lattice .",
    "the motion of the walker is affected by configuration of arrows on the lattice , which in turn affects the arrow configuration on the lattice .",
    "the walker follows the following rule : at each time step , the walker after arriving at a site rotates the arrow at that site in a clockwise direction by @xmath23 , and then moves one step along the new arrow direction .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that on any finite graph , using the above rules , the walker eventually visits all sites and settles into a limit cycle which is an eulerian circuit visiting each directed bond exactly once in a cycle .",
    "this is not the case on an infinite lattice , where the walker always finds new bonds which are not visited earlier and the number of visited sites keeps on growing .",
    "it was noted already that in @xmath19 , the diameter of the region visited by the walker grows as @xmath1 , but the asymptotic shape was not investigated .",
    "the ew with noise is defined as follows : at each time step the walker rotates the arrow at its location by @xmath24 , @xmath23 , @xmath25 or @xmath26 with probability @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath27 or @xmath27 respectively .",
    "we will show that the diameter of the region visited grows as @xmath29 for nonzero @xmath20 and as @xmath1 when @xmath22 .",
    "first we discuss the case @xmath22 .",
    "we denote the number of times different sites visited by the walker after @xmath0 steps by @xmath30 and the walker s square displacement from the origin by @xmath31 .",
    "we evaluate @xmath32 ( the over line represents averaging over initial conditions ) , the variance of @xmath33 denoted by @xmath34 $ ] , and the mean square displacement @xmath35 by averaging over @xmath36 different initial configurations .     of the walker from the origin as a function of @xmath0 for various @xmath20 values .",
    "for the pure case ( i.e. @xmath22 ) @xmath37 grows as @xmath38 with @xmath39 . in the presence of noise",
    ", there is a cross over from the eulerian ( @xmath40 ) to a simple random walk behaviour ( @xmath41).,width=331 ]      according to the heuristic argument given in ref .",
    "@xcite , if at time @xmath42 the number of sites visited by the walker is @xmath43 , then in the previous @xmath44 time steps , most of these sites have been visited exactly @xmath45 times except a small fraction at the boundary . as the cluster is seen to have few holes , it is nearly compact , and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the diameter of the cluster , at time @xmath42 .",
