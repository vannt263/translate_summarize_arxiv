    "one of the great , unanticipated legacies of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) mission is surely the detection of  absorption lines along extragalactic sight lines from the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) at @xmath19  k , as predicted by cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "hot gas in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is produced by shocks generated by gravitational instability during the formation of large - scale structure , and its detection in highly ionized oxygen is an indicator of widespread metal transport into the igm through feedback from galaxy formation .",
    "the  absorption probes gas at @xmath8  k , somewhat cooler than the bulk of the whim , which has been shock - heated to temperatures of several @xmath20  k. this latter , very hot gas is only detectable through weak x - ray absorption lines from higher ions ( e.g. , , , , , ) as described recently by @xcite .",
    "the search for the whim gas has now begun in earnest , using sensitive uv resonance absorption lines , primarily the  doublet ( 1031.926 , 1037.617   ) which is @xmath21100 times more sensitive than the x - ray transitions of ( 21.602   ) or ( 18.97   ) .",
    "thus , the initial whim detections of  were made by _ fuse _ at @xmath22 and by the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) at @xmath23 , but over a modest total redshift pathlength @xmath18 @xcite . for the portion of whim containing ,",
    "the estimated baryon fractions were @xmath215% for o / h metallicity equal to 10% of the former solar value , @xmath24 @xcite . because the solar oxygen abundance has recently been re - measured at ( o / h)@xmath25 @xcite , we have re - scaled our baryon estimates to this lower value .",
    "these estimates have large uncertainties , including untested assumptions of uniform metallicity ,  ionization equilibrium , and multiphase igm structure .",
    "the initial  searches reported only a handful of absorbers  four systems by @xcite and six by @xcite . at low redshift ,",
    "down to 50  m  equivalent width in  @xmath26 , the number of  absorbers per unit redshift is 1015% of that found in the  ly@xmath0  surveys : @xmath27 @xcite versus @xmath28 @xcite . in this study",
    ", we dramatically increase the total surveyed pathlength to @xmath29 and the total number of  absorbers to 40 .",
    "we also study the relationship between absorbers from the whim and the warm neutral medium ( wnm ; @xmath30  k ) . with the increased number of absorbers ,",
    "we can begin to look at whim absorption in a statistical manner , particularly the distribution in  column density .",
    "we began our survey with published lists of intervening ly@xmath0absorption systems toward low-@xmath15 agn obtained from ghrs and stis surveys by @xcite .",
    "other sight lines were covered by literature sources or measured at the university of colorado from stis / e140 m spectra as discussed in the upcoming danforth , shull , & rosenberg ( 2005 , hereafter paper  ii ) .",
    "we disregarded any weak ly@xmath0absorbers ( w@xmath31  m , log@xmath32 ) and searched the _ fuse _ data for higher - order lyman lines plus  and counterparts .",
    "we have been conservative in our identification of  systems , requiring unambiguous ( @xmath33 ) features , and examining multiple channels of _ fuse _ data and both lines of the  doublet when possible . in all , we analyzed 171 absorbers in 31 _ fuse _ sight lines .",
    "we measured all available lyman series lines to determine accurate @xmath3  and doppler @xmath34 values for  via curve - of - growth concordance curves @xcite .    of the ly@xmath0  absorbers , 129 were at @xmath22 , where absorption could potentially be observed .",
    "we detected  at @xmath35 or greater level in one or both lines of the doublet for 40 absorbers , and we obtained @xmath35 or greater upper limits in 84 other cases .",
    "the remaining five absorbers fell on top of airglow or strong lines from the interstellar medium ( ism ) , were blended , or were in some other way inaccessible .",
    "we determined metal - ion column densities via voigt profile fits and/or the apparent column method @xcite .",
    "we assumed that any saturation in these lines was mild , and that profile fits accurately determine the column density . in cases where we detected both  lines , we assigned a weighted mean of the column densities to @xmath2 .",
    "we describe the full details of absorber selection and data analysis in paper  ii .",
    "the  lines are ideal tracers ( at @xmath36 k ) for the warm - hot ionized medium ( whim ; @xmath37  k ) , while  traces the photoionized warm neutral medium ( wnm ; @xmath30  k ) .",
    "the left panel of figure  1 shows a weak correlation , if any , between @xmath2  and @xmath3 . while @xmath3  varies over nearly three orders of magnitude , @xmath2",
    "is detected between @xmath38 @xmath39 and a few times @xmath40 @xmath39 ( a factor of @xmath2120 ) . to gauge the relative amounts of warm photoionized gas ( ) and hot collisionally ionized gas ( )",
    ", we use the `` multiphase ratio '' , @xmath3/@xmath2 .",
    "this ratio was defined previously @xcite as a means of assessing the range in contributions from photoionized gas ( ) and collisionally ionized gas ( ) , which often appear to be associated kinematically @xcite .    as shown in the right panel of figure  1 ,",
    "the @xmath3/@xmath2  ratio exhibits a strong correlation with @xmath3 , with a typical range @xmath3/@xmath2  @xmath41 0.550 and a dispersion of less than one ( dex ) .",
    "higher  column absorbers typically display a higher multiphase ratio , while weak  absorbers have @xmath42 .",
    "we are well aware of the fact that plots such as figure  1 are subject to the effects of correlated errors in @xmath3 . however , this ratio has physical utility in deriving a mean ( o / h ) metallicity in multiphase gas ( see   4 ) , when combined with the empirical correlation between @xmath3  and hydrogen overdensity , @xmath43 , seen in cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "the large range in @xmath3  and the correlation in multiphase ratio provide evidence that the igm has at least two phases ( whim and wnm ) .",
    "if the  and  materials were well mixed , we would expect that the multiphase ratio would be constant with @xmath3 .",
    "we suggest instead that the whim occupies a shell around a warm neutral core .",
    "the outer whim shell is heated by a combination of external ionizing photons ( from agn ) , shocks from infalling clouds , and possible shocks from cluster outflows such as superwinds and snr feedback .",
    "the narrow range of @xmath2  compared to @xmath3  implies that the whim shell may have a characteristic column density of @xmath44 @xmath39 , while the neutral core can be arbitrarily large .    in this scenario , the very large values of the multiphase ratio may arise in  quiescent gas \" , possibly located in high - column density h  i gas in halos . the absence of associated  suggests the lack of shocks at velocities greater than about 150 km  s@xmath45",
    "many strong h  i ( ly@xmath0 ) absorbers have been seen in proximity ( within @xmath46 kpc ) of bright galaxies @xcite . in our current  sample , we found three absorbers with extremely high multiphase ratios : very high neutral hydrogen columns with no detectable whim . in the first case ,",
    "the absorber at @xmath47 km  s@xmath45  toward 3c273 shows log@xmath48 and log@xmath49 and is @xmath50  kpc on the sky from a dwarf ( @xmath51 ) post - starburst galaxy @xcite .",
    "the second case is the absorber at @xmath52 km  s@xmath45  toward phl1811 with log@xmath53 and log@xmath54 .",
    "this system is beyond the @xmath55 survey depth , so we can not comment on surrounding galaxies .",
    "finally , the lyman - limit system at @xmath56 km  s@xmath45  toward phl1811 shows log@xmath57 and log@xmath54 .",
    "this absorber lies @xmath58 ( @xmath59  kpc ) from an @xmath55 galaxy at @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "@xcite note a sub - dla system at @xmath61 toward pg1216 + 069 with log@xmath62 and log@xmath63 which lies 86 kpc from a sub - l@xmath64 galaxy .",
    "these four absorption systems , with multiphase ratios log@xmath65\\geq$ ] 2.5 , 2.9 , 5.0 , and 5.0 respectively , may be shielded from external ionizing flux by adjacent igm clouds and have unshocked gas .",
    "metallicity is one of the great unknowns in interpreting the baryon content of the whim absorbers . in previous studies , ( o / h )",
    "has been assumed to be constant at 10% solar .",
    "however , one might expect that metallicity variations could play a role in the multiphase ratio : outflows of material from galaxies should be denser and more enriched than primordial igm clouds .",
    "this would contribute a negative slope in the multiphase ratio plot ( figure  1b ) .",
    "instead , the denser ( high-@xmath3 ) absorbers show a relatively lower ratio of / , analogous to lower metallicity .",
    "while metallicity variations almost certainly exist in the igm , they are not the main cause of the positive slope in the multiphase ratio plot",
    ". some of this effect could arise from changes in the mean  ionization fraction , typically chosen to be the maximum value , @xmath66 at @xmath67  k in collisional ionization equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this fraction is expected to vary , depending on the range of shock velocities that produce the @xcite .",
    "using  as a tracer of the @xmath8  k portion of the whim , we can employ the number of absorbers per unit redshift , @xmath68 , to determine @xmath69 , the fraction of the critical density contributed by this whim gas .",
    "our detection statistics are shown in figure  2 for .",
    "the total redshift pathlength of our survey is a function of equivalent width , and our survey is more complete for strong absorbers than for weak absorbers .",
    "the equivalent - width sensitivity , @xmath70 , is a function of spectrograph resolution , @xmath71 , and the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the data per resolution element .",
    "thus , for a @xmath35 detection limit , we define @xmath72 .",
    "we assume @xmath73 and calculate @xmath74 profiles for each dataset based on s / n measured every 10  .",
    "strong instrumental features , ism absorption , and airglow lines are masked out ( s / n set to zero ) . from this procedure , we calculate @xmath75 for both transitions , using curves of growth with @xmath76 km  s@xmath45 . by moving an absorber doublet along the profile as a function of @xmath77 , we generate a profile @xmath78 . by adding up the total path length for each absorber at each @xmath78 , we determine the relationship between @xmath2  and @xmath79 as shown in figure  3 . with a total high-@xmath2 pathlength @xmath80 , we are at least 80% complete in  detection down to log@xmath2  = 13.4 ( @xmath81  m  in the 1032   line ) .",
    "however , @xmath79 and the completeness fall off rapidly for weaker absorbers . dividing figure  2 by figure  3 , we obtain the profile of @xmath68 as a function of @xmath2 ( figure  4 ) . to first order",
    ", this procedure should correct for incompleteness in our  survey .",
    "our incompleteness - corrected value of the absorber frequency , @xmath82 , compares well with previous , uncorrected values ( table  1 ) . for  absorbers with @xmath83  m  ( in @xmath84 )",
    ", we find @xmath85 , somewhat lower than the value , @xmath86 , found by @xcite using six  absorbers toward pg0953 + 415 . for the weaker  absorbers , we find @xmath87 ( @xmath88  m ) and @xmath89 ( @xmath90  m ) from our total sample of @xmath91 measured  absorbers .",
    "uncertainties are based on single - sided @xmath92 confidence limits in poisson statistics @xcite .",
    "@xcite found @xmath93 at 90% confidence for @xmath88  m , based on four absorbers toward h1821 + 643 .",
    "a recent study @xcite using stis / e140 m data finds @xmath94 for @xmath88  m  based on 44  absorbers .",
    "this sample was taken at slightly higher redshift ( @xmath95 ) than our sample ( @xmath96 ) and shows a higher value of @xmath97 .",
    "this is not predicted by simulations , which predict an _ increasing _ whim fraction at recent epochs .",
    "however , the difference in redshift between the two samples is small , and the discrepancy in @xmath82 may be a result of cosmic variance .",
    "recent cosmological simulations of the x - ray forest predict a distribution of  absorbers and provide a convenient way to check current simulations with observed data .",
    "@xcite model the x - ray forest assuming a @xmath98cdm model similar to @xcite , both collisional ionization and photoionization from a uv background , radiative cooling , and a range of different metallicities .",
    "the cumulative distribution of  absorbers ( @xmath99 $ ] ) down to a minimum equivalent width is drawn from these models and provides a convenient comparison with observed statistics from our work and previous surveys ( see figure  5 ) .",
    "the simulation with @xmath100 shows a reasonably good match to the observed cumulative distribution of  absorbers in the local universe .",
    "weaker absorbers ( @xmath101 m ) are overpredicted compared with observations , but this may be a matter of small - number statistics or differing detection thresholds between observations and simulations .",
    "a simulation in which metallicity is a function of overdensity fits the data slightly better than the fixed - metallicity model .",
    "however , @xcite caution that there is a substantial scatter in the simulations , so that the lower - metallicity curves are essentially indistinguishable .",
    "the @xmath102 model of @xcite also fits the observed data reasonably well , but it is based on a less physical simulation with no photoionization and no radiative cooling . the solar metallicity model of the igm can clearly be ruled out by our observations .",
    "simulations at lower metallicities ( @xmath103 ) would be helpful , given the wealth of new observational results .",

    "we assume a hubble constant @xmath126 km  s@xmath45  mpc@xmath45 , rather than their value @xmath127 , and we make standard assumptions regarding  ionization fraction and ( o / h ) metallicity @xcite .",
    "we adopt an ionization fraction , @xmath128 characteristic of its maximum value in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) and assume an o / h abundance 10% of the solar value .",
    "of course , cie is almost certainly not a valid assumption for the low - density igm .",
    "as the infalling gas is shock - heated during structure formation , the ionization states , , and undergo transient spikes in abundance , followed by cooling and recombination . recent time - dependent models of the ionization , recombination , and cooling of shock - heated , low - density whim @xcite find that the mean , time - averaged  ion fraction is @xmath129835% , over a range of initial temperatures @xmath130 .",
    "these fractions are compatible ( with a factor of two spread ) with the fiducial value , @xmath131 , based on the maximum fraction of  at @xmath132  k , in cie @xcite .",
    "as shown above ( fig .",
    "5 ) , a metallicity @xmath100 is reasonably consistent with the observed equivalent width distribution of   absorbers at @xmath133 .",
    "however , using our sample of  and   absorbers , we can make a more direct estimate of the ( o / h ) metallicity .",
    "to do so , we must estimate the amount of hydrogen associated with each component of the the multiphase system of photoionized  and collisionally ionized .",
    "since the  and  absorbers are associated kinematically , we assume they share the same metallicity .",
    "we then use the empirical relations between @xmath3  and overdensity , @xmath43 , and between the multiphase ratio ( @xmath3/@xmath2 ) and @xmath3 .      and @xmath135 the above relations allow us to relate @xmath3  to the physical gas density , @xmath136 , needed for the hydrogen photoionization correction .",
    "equation ( 1 ) is derived by fitting the multiphase correlation in fig .",
    "1b over the approximate range @xmath137 .",
    "the scaling constant @xmath138 is the mean multiphase ratio at log@xmath3  = 14 , and the best - fitting slope is @xmath139 .",
    "equation ( 2 ) comes from cosmological simulations @xcite and relates the hydrogen overdensity , @xmath43 , to the  column density , n@xmath140 .    from these relations",
    ", we can derive a statistical value of the ( o / h ) metallicity from the formula , @xmath141 we employ the multiphase ratio , @xmath3/@xmath2 , together with appropriate ionization correction factors , @xmath16 and @xmath142 .",
    "the  fraction is derived from photoionization equilibrium in the low-@xmath15 igm @xmath143 for gas with @xmath144 at temperature @xmath145 , photoionized at rate @xmath146 .",
    "since the mean - free path of a lyman continuum photon is very large in the low - overdensity igm , we use the case - a recombination rate coefficient @xmath147 . combining the two empirical relations with the relation of photoionization equilibrium , we find that the mean oxygen metallicity of the  absorbers at @xmath148 is @xmath149 given the uncertainties in these empirical relations , it is remarkable that this formula arrives at an oxygen abundance near the fiducial value of 10% solar .",
    "in fact , our estimated value , @xmath150 , is probably accurate to only a factor of 2 .",
    "we now derive the fractional contribution to closure density of whim baryons associated with hot , @xmath151 we perform the above sum using the value , @xmath152 , for each column - density bin in figure  4 , with @xmath153 chosen as the mean column density ( @xmath39 ) in the bin .",
    "we find @xmath154 .",
    "values of @xmath69 for other equivalent width thresholds are listed in table  1 along with the results of other studies converted to uniform values of @xmath155 , @xmath16 , and ( o / h)@xmath156 .",
    "it should be stressed that these estimates of @xmath69 are based on an assumed uniform 10% solar ( o / h ) metallicity and that further uncertainty arises in our assumed  ionization fraction .",
    "changes in @xmath16 within the range of mean values @xcite could change our result by a factor of two .",
    "based on the standard assumptions , our result is slightly lower than the result published by @xcite , @xmath157 .",
    "@xcite used an older solar oxygen abundance , ( o / h)@xmath158 , which is 50% larger than the @xcite value . after correcting for this difference",
    ", their result for @xmath69 is larger than ours .",
    "@xcite find @xmath159 based on 44 absorbers at @xmath23 .",
    "our estimate corresponds to @xmath160 , so that whim gas in the range @xmath8  k makes up roughly 5% of the baryonic mass in the local universe .",
    "the contribution could exceed 10% if we account for the likely spread in ( o / h ) metallicities and   ionization fractions .",
    "simulations predict that the current universe is composed of @xmath161% whim gas , so our value of @xmath162% falls short of this mark .",
    "however ,  is only useful as a proxy for gas within the lower portion of the whim temperature range .",
    "accounting for the hotter @xmath163  k gas using similar methodology will require high - sensitivity , high resolution x - ray observations of and with spectrographs aboard future missions such as constellation - x or xeus @xcite .",
    "limited observational work has been done in this area @xcite , but the current generation of x - ray telescopes are not ideal for this kind of investigation .",
    "the distribution of  absorbers with column density is often expressed as a power law with index @xmath164 : @xmath165 @xcite .",
    "for the first time , this analysis can be applied to whim species .",
    "we find that the differential number of  absorbers with column density is a power law , @xmath166 for absorbers with log@xmath167 .",
    "this is somewhat steeper than the corresponding  distribution , @xmath168 @xcite and means that low - column absorbers contribute comparable amounts to the  baryon census as the rare high - column systems .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "[ 6 ] , @xmath69 scales as @xmath169 for @xmath170 .",
    "even though we correct for incompleteness in the weaker absorbers , the statistics are still poor at log @xmath171 .",
    "it is unclear whether the turnover in @xmath97 at lower columns is real or a statistical fluctuation from small numbers of weak absorbers .",
    "nevertheless , the weak  absorbers appear to make significant contributions to the baryon mass density .",
    "the steep power law also reinforces our conclusions about the nature of the multiphase igm with a core - halo structure .",
    "we have demonstrated that the contributions from weak  absorbers can not be neglected in an accurate whim baryon census .",
    "the rare strong  absorbers and numerous weak absorbers contribute nearly equally to @xmath69 .",
    "further fuse observations at high - s / n will allow us to probe weak  absorbers and refine the statistics at the low - column end of the absorber distribution .",
    "an analysis of  absorbers at higher redshifts ( @xmath172 ) would allow us to track changes in the whim density , confirming the decrease in the amount of shocked gas at higher redshifts predicted by cosmological simulations @xcite .    only by enlarging our sample of multiphase ( , ) absorbers beyond the 40 discussed here",
    "will we be able to refine our statistical estimate for the metallicity of the whim . with a much larger sample of  absorbers , we could use maximum - likelihood techniques to search for the expected trends : ( 1 ) decreasing metallicity at lower overdensity @xmath43 @xcite ; ( 2 ) decreasing @xmath173 at higher redshift @xcite ; and ( 3 ) trends of @xmath3/@xmath2with other metal indicators such as , , or .",
