    "transport through mesoscopic systems has received enormous interest within the last decade.@xcite the advances in current progress in microfabrication technology have enabled studies of transport through quantum systems in which the charge carriers behave coherently . in recent years",
    ", much effort has been devoted to coherent transport in various coupled quantum - dot and quantum - wire associated structures such as open quantum dot,@xcite embedded dot,@xcite side - coupled - dot,@xcite antidot,@xcite multidot,@xcite and coupled quantum - wire systems.@xcite rich quantum interference phenomena in mesoscopic systems have been discussed in various aspects such as bound - state features,@xcite spin - related switching,@xcite phase switching,@xcite and andreev current switching.@xcite over the last few years , the search for the quantum transport through quantum - dot systems has made great progress .",
    "for example , coherent probing experiment for investigating phase switching of aharonov - bohm oscillation in differential conductance in a two - dot embedded quantum ring has been performed.@xcite the study of switching effects has thus drawn a great deal of interest in application and at the fundamental level .",
    "theoretically , transport investigations in quantum - dot systems are often based on the anderson model.@xcite commonly , it has been assumed that the geometry is discrete in real space and the coupling between the system and the external electrodes is relatively weak.@xcite the open systems considered were usually idealized to be strictly one - dimensional implying the assumption of a single - mode propagation , namely that the finite width effect of the system was not included .",
    "alternatively , the lippmann - schwinger formalism assumes a continuous model that has been used to calculate the electronic and atomic dynamics of nanoscale conductors under steady - state current flow.@xcite this theory was subsequently applied considering electronic transport through laterally parallel double open quantum dots embedded inside a quantum wire.@xcite it allowed us to look at arbitrary multidot potential profiles and illustrate the results by performing computational simulations for the electronic conductance through the system with multi - mode propagation .",
    "we found that the coupling modes of the dots are tunable by adjusting the strength of a central barrier in the wire .",
    "in this present work , we utilize the lippmann - schwinger formalism to achieve a full quantum mechanical description of the dynamics of side - coupled quantum - dot systems .",
    "we solve a set of coupled lippmann - schwinger equations to express each individual continuum wave function of the entire system in terms of the corresponding asymptotic wave function of the source - drain leads , and the scattering potential representing the mesoscopic system via the appropriate scattering green function .",
    "transport regimes arising from the strong interplay between the dot structures and the open mesoscopic system are investigated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the general scheme and description of quantum transport calculation based on the framework of lippmann - schwinger formalism . in sec.iii ,",
    "the manipulation of the side - coupled quantum dots is addressed .",
    "coherent switching effects by either tuning the electronic energy or detuning one of the side - coupled dots are discussed . finally , in sec .",
    "iv we shall summarize and draw conclusions .",
    "the physical system under investigation is a two - dimensional nanowire with side - coupled quantum dots .",
    "the considered infinitely long wire allows electrons to propagate along the wire direction while being confined transversely .",
    "the considered mesoscopic system can be viewed as three divided regions , namely the left source lead , the scattering region including the side - coupled dots , and the right drain lead , as is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : qwire_setup ] .    the hamiltonian describing the system can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the scattering potential describing the side - coupled quantum dots , localized inside the scattering region .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 stands for the effective mass of the electron .",
    "the confining potential @xmath4 is assumed of the parabolic form @xmath5 leading to the discrete subband energy levels @xmath6 with @xmath7 = @xmath8 and level spacing @xmath9 = @xmath10 .    for the @xmath7-th mode and without magnetic field , the unperturbed eigenfunctions of @xmath11 can be expressed as @xmath12 \\chi_n ( y)$ ] , where @xmath13 stands for the confinement modes of the nanowire , determined by @xmath14   \\chi_{n}(y ) = \\varepsilon_{n } \\chi_{n}(y),\\ ] ] and the wave number @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 we would like to mention that the real wave number @xmath15 implies the @xmath7-th mode being a propagating mode , otherwise it indicates an evanescent mode that plays an important role to quantum interference in coherent transport . for an electron incident from the source electrode with energy @xmath17 occupying the mode @xmath7 , the electron may be reflected into mode @xmath18 with amplitude @xmath19 or transmitted into mode @xmath18 with amplitude @xmath20 to the drain electrode .",
    "the corresponding wave function describing the scattering processes can be expressed as @xmath21 if @xmath22 ; @xmath23 if @xmath24 ; and @xmath25 if @xmath26 .",
    "here @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 denote the left source lead , the scattering region , and the right drain lead , respectively .",
    "in addition , @xmath30 represents the @xmath31 component of the @xmath18-th mode scattering wave function in the scattering region .",
    "this allows us to expand the schrdinger equation in the scattering region into a set of coupled differential equations @xmath32 in which all evanescent and propagating intermediate modes @xmath33 are taken into account .",
    "the coupling between these intermediate modes is characterized by the matrix elements of the scattering potential , namely @xmath34 here , the matrix elements are calculated analytically .    to obtain the lippmann - schwinger equation for handling the transport properties , we start from the unperturbed green function , that obeys the differential equation @xmath35 describing the electron incident from the source electrode .",
    "this unperturbed green function can be expressed as @xmath36 and is utilized to transform from the differential equations ( [ eq : coupled_ode ] ) into an infinite set of coupled lippmann - schwinger equations    @xmath37    the transmission amplitude @xmath20 for transmission from the @xmath7-th mode to the @xmath18-th mode can be found by looking at the asymptotic limit @xmath38 , resulting in @xmath39 where @xmath18 and @xmath7 are propagating modes .",
    "based on the framework of the well known landauer - bttiker formalism,@xcite the transmission probability @xmath40 can be calculated numerically at the fermi surface , and the conductance is related to the transmission,@xcite expressed as @xmath41 where the sum is over all propagating modes .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the solution of the coupled lippmann - schwinger equations ( [ eq : coupled_lippmannschwinger ] ) is achieved by putting the @xmath31 variable on a grid .",
    "the integrals are computed by using extended bode s rule  @xcite for numerical integration , taking care of the cusp in the green function ( [ eq : greensfunction ] ) at @xmath42 before integrating .",
    "finally , we note that the above lippmann - schwinger model is quite general towards the choice of a confinement and scattering potentials .",
    "to explore the electronic transport properties in an open mesoscopic system consisting of a nanowire influenced by side - coupled quantum dots , we assume the system to be fabricated in a high - mobility gaas - al@xmath43ga@xmath44as heterostructure forming a two - dimensional electron gas such that the effective mass of an electron is @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the free electron mass .",
    "in addition , we select the confinement parameter such that the energy level spacing is @xmath47  mev . in the numerical calculation",
    ", it is convenient to redefine the energy scale by the lowest subband energy @xmath48  mev and the length scale by the characteristic length @xmath49  nm . in all the figures shown below , we have defined the energy - related parameter @xmath50 where the integral part of @xmath51 indicates the number of propagating modes at the energy @xmath17.@xcite we note that numerical accuracy was always carefully checked and the calculations were performed using in total 20 subbands and 301 grid points . in the following , we shall investigate the dynamic motion of the electronic wave in a quantum wire with side - coupled quantum dots .",
    "a side - coupled quantum dot system can be regarded as an open mesoscopic system with transport characteristics that are tunable by a kind of side - stub nanostructures .",
    "in contrast to the embedded quantum - dot system , the transmission through the side - coupled quantum - dot system consists of a quantum interference between the ballistic nanowire and the resonant channels in the side - coupled nanostructures .",
    "recent works dealing with side - coupled quantum - dot system rely mainly on an anderson model in which the side - coupled dots are assumed to behave effectively like artificial quantum impurities.@xcite it is thus warranted to devote further effort in developing numerical techniques in order to analyze the quantum behavior of the electronic transport in a side - coupled quantum - dot system with an expected smooth profile .",
    "we start by modeling a quantum wire with single or double side - coupled quantum dots , placed symmetrically in parallel on each side of the nanowire .",
    "the scattering potential describing the pair of quantum dots is modeled by a linear combination of four gaussian functions @xmath52 }   \\nonumber\\\\   & & +   v_{1b } e^{-[\\beta_{x,1b}(x - x_{1})^2+\\beta_{y,1b}(y - y_{1})^2 ] }   \\nonumber\\\\   & & +   v_{2a } e^{-[\\beta_{x,2a}(x - x_{2})^2+\\beta_{y,2a}(y - y_{2})^2 ] }   \\nonumber\\\\   & & +   v_{2b } e^{-[\\beta_{x,2b}(x - x_{2})^2+\\beta_{y,2b}(y - y_{2})^2]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first two terms describe the geometry of quantum dot 1 and the last two terms are associated to quantum dot 2 , as is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : twop_scqd_potential](a ) . in this subsection",
    ", we focus on two identical side - coupled dots , namely with @xmath53 and @xmath54 in units of @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , we assume that the two quantum dots are in parallel and at the same distance on opposite sides of the nanowire , centered at @xmath56 and @xmath57 in units of @xmath58 , respectively . moreover , the form factors describing the broadening of the quantum dots are selected as @xmath59 and @xmath60 in units of @xmath61 , respectively . in fig.[fig : twop_scqd_potential](b ) , we show the transverse profiles due to the contributions of the confining and the scattering potentials at @xmath62 .",
    "the dashed - green curve indicates the transverse potential profile of the unperturbed nanowire , and the double side - coupled dot system has a potential profile illustrated by the solid - red curve .",
    "later on , we shall adjust the parameter @xmath63 of the lower quantum dot 2 by @xmath64 , thus varying the depth of dot 2 , for studying the sensitivity and dynamics of quantum interference effects .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : twop_scqd_enedata ] we show the conductance as a function of the parameter @xmath51 for the lowest two conductance plateaus for the case of double side - coupled dots ( solid red ) in comparison with the case of a single side - coupled dot ( dashed blue ) and the unperturbed nanowire ( dotted green ) . in the absence of a side - coupled quantum dots ,",
    "the conductance of the ideal nanowire reproduces the well known conductance quantization plateaus in units of @xmath65 . for the case of a single side - coupled dot and the instate in the low kinetic energy regime , the conductance",
    "is strongly suppressed due to an enhanced backscattering by the quantum dot .",
    "the backscattering effect is blue shifted by including the second quantum dot .",
    "this interesting conductance suppression effect can be applied as a conductance switching at @xmath66 by turning on and off the quantum dot 2 by tuning a gate voltage used to form it .    in the mediate kinetic energy regime of the second subband region , there is a clear antisymmetric peak - and - dip structure in the conductance around @xmath67 , exhibiting the well - known fano resonance feature.@xcite this is attributed to quantum interference between the continuum in the wire and the quasibound state in the side - coupled quantum dots .",
    "both in the single and double side - coupled - dot systems , the fano peaks can reach @xmath68 .",
    "however , the fano dip of the single - dot case reaches @xmath69 but the fano dip of the double - dot case may be suppressed to zero conductance .",
    "this implies that only the electrons occupying the second subband contribute to the resonance reflection for the case of single - dot , however for the case of double - dot the electrons occupying both subbands may contribute to the resonant reflection leading to the @xmath70 drop from the fano peak .    to demonstrate the above fano resonance behavior in conductance we show , in figs .",

    "b _ * ( @xmath72 ) for the case of double side - coupled dots , respectively .",
    "for the single - dot case , the electron occupying the first subband ( @xmath7=@xmath73 ) are in an extended state with negligible coupling to the upper dot , however the electron occupying the second subband ( @xmath7=@xmath74 ) couple strongly to the upper dot and are resonantly reflected . for the case of double side - coupled dots , both the electrons occupying the first and the second subbands are able to couple strongly to the side - coupled dots and are resonantly reflected .",
    "consequently , for the cases of a single and double side - coupled quantum dots , the strengths of the fano lineshapes are @xmath69 or @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "we would like to mention in passing that the scattering states for the peak and the dip are very similar , showing a strong and long - lived quasibound state feature that is localized in each of the two quantum dots .",
    "the shape of the quasibound states indicates that these are the lowest quasibound states in the quantum dots .",
    "double quantum dot systems are good candidates for revealing coherent quantum transport properties .",
    "energy detuning between the different quantum - dot levels can be experimentally investigated by using charging diagram measurements or using an excitation spectroscopy technique.@xcite from application point of view , it was found that the conduction in a cavity mode with detuning parameter may be utilized as a quantum bit readout.@xcite it is thus warranted to investigate the detuning effects by considering a parallel side - coupled double - dot system .",
    "the physical parameters considered here are the same as in the previous subsection such that the two side - coupled dots are identical and the system remains spatially symmetric .",
    "the lower quantum dot 2 is adjusted by the parameter @xmath75 by tuning a gate voltage so that the energy levels of the lower quantum dot 2 are relatively detuned and the spatial symmetry of the system is broken . as a result , the symmetry of the quasibound state feature causing the fano resonance ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : twop_scqd_enedata ] ) tends to be destroyed by increasing the detuning potential . comparing to overall scattering potentials and characteristic energies ,",
    "the detuning parameters are assumed to be relatively small such that the detuning only has an effect on the resonance structure around @xmath76 .",
    "figure  [ fig : twop_scqd_enedata_dt1 ] demonstrates the conductance as a function of the parameter @xmath51 as well as the detuning parameter @xmath75 .",
    "the deviation of the peak and the dip structures forming the fano lineshape tends to be suppressed by increasing the detuning potential .",
    "both the peak and the dip structures get less pronounced and the peak may crossover to a dip when the detuning parameter @xmath75 is sufficiently large . also , we observe an avoided crossing of the peak and the dip during variation of the detuning parameter through zero .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : twop_scqd_enedata_dt2 ] , we present the conductance characteristics with detuning parameter @xmath77 ( solid red ) in comparison to the case without detuning @xmath78 ( dashed blue ) . furthermore , in figs .",
    "[ fig : psi_e ] , [ fig : psi_f ] , and [ fig : psi_g ] , we present , in order of energy , the square root of the probability densities of the scattering states at the energies labeled by * _ e _ * , * _ f _ * , and * _ g _ * , respectively , in fig .",
    "[ fig : twop_scqd_enedata_dt2 ] . in the presence of detuning @xmath79 ,",
    "two significant breit - wigner dips are found at @xmath17 = @xmath80 ( labeled by * _ e _ * ) and @xmath81 ( labeled by * _ g _ * ) .",
    "it turns out that the anti - resonant dip features are significantly different from the antisymmetric fano resonance for the symmetric case in the absence of detuning .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these breit - wigner structures in conductance are associated to the long - lived quasibound states in the lower dot for case * _ e _ * and in the upper dot in for case * _ g _ * , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : psi_e ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : psi_g ] respectively .",
    "this important feature demonstrates the possibility of _ coherent switching _ between the lower and the upper side - coupled dots by appropriately adjusting the electronic energy .",
    "this could have interesting applications in quantum interference devices based on coherent control of the quantum interference of side - coupled double quantum dots .",
    "we would like to bring attention in passing that the real space probability density of the scattering states shown in fig.[fig : psi_f ] corresponding to the point * _ f _ * of solid red curve in fig.[fig : twop_scqd_enedata_dt2 ] has significant coupling between the extended propagating modes in the quantum channel and both the side - coupled quantum dots .",
    "in addition , the quasibound states localized in each quantum dots are considerably suppressed and the scattering behavior is much weaker than both the cases * _ e _ * and * _ g_*.    the peak - to - dip crossover feature demonstrated in fig.[fig : twop_scqd_enedata_dt1 ] motivates us to investigate further the processes around @xmath82 where only a single peak is significantly visible . in fig .  [",
    "fig : twop_scqd_enedata_dt3](a ) , we thus focus on the conductance as a function of the rescaled electron energy for the case of @xmath83 that is presented by solid red curve in comparison with the case with no detuning shown by dashed blue curve .",

    "j _ * , it is helpful to compare with the square root probability density in the real space shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psi_j ] .",
    "electrons entering the system in the lowest two subbands mainly form long - lived quasibound states in the lower side - coupled quantum dot 1 .",
    "second , we would like to see the point marked by * _ k _ * that is an energy regime between the blip structure * _ j _ * and the dip structure * _ l_*. the localized electrons tend to be coupled to the central quantum channel as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psi_k ] .",
    "the @xmath7=@xmath73 mode exhibits stronger coupling to the upper dot and manifests a high transmission feature , however the @xmath7=@xmath74 mode with higher coupling to the lower dot exhibits a total reflection .",
    "concerning the point marked by * _",
    "l _ * ( @xmath87 ) , the electrons occupying the lowest two subbands tend to form long - lived quasibound states in the upper dot . these interesting features accessible by adjusting the electronic energy from * _ j _ * to * _ l _ * may be applicable for _ coherent switching _ of charge accumulation between the lower and the upper dot .",
    "we note that the small blip marked by * _ j _ * can induce a strong and long - lived bound state in quantum dot 2 .",
    "this is not straight forward expected from the relationship of lifetime and full - width at half - maximum of the resonance structures in the conductance .",
    "this counterintuitive feature in conductance is related to an occurrence of a bound state in continuum ( bic ) in the double side - coupled quantum dot system .",
    "bic is a discrete energy normalizable bound state above the continuum threshold in energy , having vanishing resonance width and in principle infinite lifetime . shortly after that the schrdinger equation was put forward",
    "were von neumann and wigner the first to predict the existence of the bic phenomenon.@xcite there , the bic behavior was regarded as a mathematical curiosity attributed to rather unphysical spherically symmetric potentials .",
    "later on , more detailed analysis of the bic was presented by stillinger and herrick.@xcite friedrich and wintegen showed that the bic may occur due to the interference of resonances that can be analyzed using the feshbach resonance theory:@xcite suppose two resonances can be tuned as a function of a continuous parameter , for a certain condition one of the resonances may have a vanishing resonant width .",
    "this fact was discussed in a number of physical systems both with analytical and numerical models.@xcite it is worth mentioning that the resonance width can also turn to zero in open systems such as the angle of a bent waveguide is varied.@xcite the bic has also been discussed in the context of nuclear dynamics on coupled potential surfaces.@xcite furthermore , it has also been proposed that the bic causes a very narrow absorption peak in a semiconductor heterostructure superlattice.@xcite    in our system , the two resonant states are the quasibound states in the two side - coupled quantum dots and the continuous parameter is the detuning parameter @xmath75 .",
    "however , it has not been reported that a bic structure in conductance can be controlled by appropriately detuning one of a side - coupled quantum dots .",
    "furthermore , we would like to bring attention to that the strong quasibound state at the blip structure in the conductance is not the bic but an indication of the existence of such a state in the double side - coupled quantum dot system , since the bic or the `` ghost fano resonance '' feature has been predicted to occur only when the configuration is totally symmetric.@xcite",
    "we have developed a theoretical model by implementing the lippmann - schwinger formalism to demonstrate and elucidate the quantum transport properties of a quantum dot systems side - coupled to a nanowire . in the present work , we propose that the conductance can be switched on and off by turning on and off one of the side - coupled double quantum dots controlled by using a gate voltage .",
    "it has been verified experimentally that a conductance switching can be achieved either in a conducting polymer wire by controlling the redox state of the polymer with a potential of the nanoelectrodes.@xcite theoretically , taylor and co - workers also investigated the conductance switching features in a molecular device for studying the effect of side groups on the electrical properties of a monolayer.@xcite    furthermore , we have demonstrated the possibility of using the detuning parameter to achieve _ coherent switching _ between the lower and the upper side - coupled dots by appropriately adjusting the electronic energy .",
    "this may be utilized in designing quantum devices based on the coherent control of the side - coupled dots . for the case of slight detuning ,",
    "say @xmath88 , we have found a small blip structure in conductance that is very sensitive to the detuning parameter .",
    "coherent switching of charge accumulation for this case is proposed and its relation to the bic feature is also discussed .",
    "similar coherent switching features can be found in the case of quadrupole side - coupled quantum - dot system by means of detuning technique , but the analysis is more difficult due to the complicated quantum interference among the four dots .",
    "the significantly different conductance properties , however , will be discussed elsewhere . in order to reveal the coherence switching and the dynamics of electronic transport in a side - coupled quantum - dot system ,",
    "more intricate measurements are required .",
    "we wish that the above proposed switching effects will stimulate experimental efforts in the near future .",
