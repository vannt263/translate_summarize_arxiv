    "galactic winds are driven by supernovae and stellar winds in starburst galaxies .",
    "they drive outflows of metals and dust from the interstellar medium ( ism ) into the galactic halo and even into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "these outflows may also heat the intracluster medium and enrich it with metals , although the amount of matter permanently escaping the galaxy is still debated .",
    "the amount of interstellar gas expelled into the igm by a starburst in a `` blowout '' is thought to depend on the star formation rate within the galaxy , the escape velocity of the galaxy , and the presence of an extended , low - density gaseous halo ( silich & tenorio - tagle 1998 ; legrand et al .",
    "2001 ) . in dwarf starbursts ,",
    "the mass - loss measurements have focused on the ionized components of this multi - phase flow . in this paper",
    ", we explore the kinematics of the cold , neutral clouds in dwarf starburst outflows .    due to their low gravitational potential , dwarf starburst galaxies have small binding energies and may be particularly vulnerable to large mass loss via superwinds .",
    "previous works have studied x - ray emission from hot gas within the starbursts ( dahlem , weaver , & heckman 1998 ; martin , kobulnicky , & heckman 2002 ) , and optical line emission ( e.g. lehnert & heckman 1996 ) and absorption ( martin & armus 2004 ; rupke , vielleux , & sanders 2002 ; heckman et al .",
    "2000 - hereafter hlsa ) from larger , more luminous galaxies .",
    "other studies have observed dwarf galaxies in emission ( marlowe et al .",
    "1995 ; martin 1999 ) , but ours is among the first to study dwarf starbursts in neutral absorption lines at optical wavelengths .",
    "we present a small sample of dwarf starburst galaxies and attempt to quantify mass flux in the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) .",
    "the advantage of looking at absorption lines is that we can eliminate all ambiguity in the direction of the radial flow of gas .",
    "using the starburst itself as a background continuum source , it is known absolutely whether the gas we see in absorption is falling in ( redshifted ) or expanding outward ( blueshifted ) . moreover , unlike emission lines , whose strength scales as density squared , the strength of spectral lines seen in absorption are directly proportional to the column density of the neutral gas along the line of sight .",
    "several previous studies ( phillips 1993 ; lequeux et al . 1995 ; gonzalez - delgado et al . 1998 ; hlsa ; martin & armus 2004 ) have detected interstellar absorption lines in starburst galaxies of various sizes and morphologies , finding blueshifted neutral gas and related large - scale outflows of metals .",
    "hlsa find an average outflow speed of @xmath8100 km s@xmath1 for luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) and more recently , martin & armus ( 2004 ) and rupke et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find outflow speeds of up to 700 km s@xmath1 for two samples of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "we focus our observations on the absorption doublet ( 5889.95   and 5895.92   , also called the na d doublet ) because it is stronger than any other optical resonance line ( e.g. , ) ; most other cosmically abundant resonance lines are produced in the uv and therefore can not be observed in nearby galaxies with ground - based telescopes . na d is a good tracer of cold neutral gas because its ionization potential ( 5.14 ev ) is less than that of hydrogen , so we can be sure any absorption is occuring in a cold region of the ism .",
    "it is also important to note that sodium is not as strongly depleted in diffuse , low - velocity clouds as or ( spitzer 1968 ; savage & sembach 1996 ) . by using high resolution spectroscopy",
    "we can resolve individual , kinematically distinct doublet components within the absorption profiles . at lower resolution ,",
    "deconvolving the absorption components of disparate origins is a more difficult task ( see , e.g. , hlsa ) .",
    "it is our goal to observationally determine the kinematics of the cnm in our sample of starburst galaxies . in the second section of this paper , we discuss the observations , data reduction , and basic data analysis . in ",
    "3 we detail our method of separating stellar and interstellar sodium , discuss the kinematics and widths of the absorption features , and then use the interstellar sodium to determine a column density . in ",
    "4 we present our interpretation of the data , including simple models for outflow scenarios in the individual galaxies .",
    "the final section summarizes our major results .",
    "we observed eight nearby galaxies using the keck i high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ; vogt et al .",
    "1994 ) on 3 - 5 february 2000 .",
    "table 1 lists relevant properties of the galaxies .",
    "six of the eight galaxies in the sample are classified as dwarfs ; we define dwarf galaxies to have m@xmath12 -18 for our choice of h@xmath13 = 75 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 .",
    "ngc 1614 is a lirg ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "m82 is slightly brighter than a dwarf galaxy , but less luminous than a lirg , making it a good object with which to study the transition between the dwarfs and the lirgs ( sofue 1997 ) .",
    "the dwarf galaxies were selected mainly for compatibility with martin 1998 , which provides reference h@xmath14 ( @xmath156563 ) narrowband images as well as preselecting galaxies with intense star formation over the range -13.5 @xmath16 m@xmath17 @xmath16 -18.5 .",
    "the sample of galaxies observed here are also seen in h@xmath14 to contain expanding supershells of ionized gas .",
    "ngc 1614 was not observed in that study , but does have large - scale h@xmath14 structure ( neff et al .",
    "the slit in martin s 1998 observations missed the bubble in ngc 5253 ; however , this galaxy was seen to contain an expanding shell in h@xmath14 by marlowe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "the galaxies were observed with hires using both the red and blue cross dispersers to obtain full coverage of the desired wavelength range ( i.e. from to ) .",
    "the red cross disperser covered the spectral range 5400  7700   ; the blue cross - disperser produced spectra in the range 3700    ",
    "5900   , with echelle orders overlapping in wavelength to give complete spectral coverage to @xmath85000   .",
    "one galaxy , ngc 4214 , was observed at two positions , hereafter called ngc 4214 - 1 and ngc 4214 - 2 ( a bright star cluster at the galactic nucleus and a cluster of star - forming knots , respectively  see  4.2.4 ) .",
    "ngc 4214 - 2 was not observed with the blue cross - disperser . in all galaxies ,",
    "the slit covered the brightest optical cluster to give the strongest continuum source against which to measure the absorption .",
    "decker a12 was used ; the slit size was 10  @xmath18 0.73  for ngc 1614 and ngc 4449 , and 10  @xmath18 1.24  for all other galaxies .",
    "the spectra were processed with the echelle package in iraf using standard techniques .",
    "the ccd chip overscan region was used to bias - subtract the images , and a quartz lamp was used to flat - field the images in ccdproc .",
    "cosmic rays were removed from the ccd images by averaging multiple images of the same galaxy taken in succession on the same night ; if multiple frames were unavailable , the iraf task cosmicray was used to remove singular , bright pixels from the image .",
    "we did not flux - calibrate the spectra , as we are concerned primarily with measuring the equivalent width of absorption lines , which are purely a function of the normalized continuum intensity ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "a thorium - argon lamp was observed for spectral wavelength calibration , resulting in rms residuals in each echelle order of less than 0.5 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the resolution of the spectrum is 11 km s@xmath1 ( 6 km s@xmath1 ) for the 1.24  ( 0.73  ) slit , as measured from night sky lines .",
    "after the orders were extracted and the sky background was subtracted using the task doecslit , the spectrum for each order was divided by the continuum to provide a normalized spectrum .",
    "the absorption line profiles were fit with gaussian components using the iraf task specfit ( kriss 1994 ) .",
    "this allowed us to fit multiple pairs of sodium lines to each profile and accurately measure the equivalent width of the lines .",
    "the na d doublet was detected in six of the eight galaxies : ngc 1569 , ngc 1614 , ngc 4214 - 1 and -2 , ngc 4449 , ngc 5253 , and m82 .",
    "no absorption was seen in ngc 2363 or i zw 18 .",
    "we believe the na d in ngc 5253 , ngc 4214 - 1 , and specific components of ngc 1569 and ngc 4449 are likely stellar in nature , via arguments discussed in section 3.1 .",
    "the spectra of the five galaxies in which interstellar sodium absorption was detected are shown in figure 1 ; there are a total of ten interstellar na d absorption components .",
    "it is interesting to compare the absorption line kinematics to those of emission - line gas .",
    "kinematics were previously measured across large regions in the dwarfs in this paper and m82 to map out superbubbles by martin 1998 .",
    "our observations directly measured the h@xmath14 also  albeit over a much smaller region .",
    "nonetheless , we can use the h@xmath14 along these particular sightlines to tie na d kinematics into these larger structures .",
    "the detailed results of these spectra will be discussed individually in ",
    "4.2      in order to make a statement about the properties of the interstellar sodium in these galaxies , we need to first determine that the sodium we see is actually interstellar .",
    "the na d resonance doublet is prominent in the spectra of cooler stars .",
    "the spectrum of a dwarf will be dominated by k - type giants and supergiants if the starburst is older than @xmath810 myr ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) ; these stars show strong photospheric sodium absorption .",
    "therefore , we must find a way of deciphering the nature of the neutral sodium observed .",
    "we have made use of the available stellar spectral lines in our data to help distinguish between stellar and interstellar sodium .",
    "in particular , the mg b band triplet ( 5167.32   , 5172.68   , and 5183.60   ) is a good indicator of the presence of certain stellar populations .",
    "the mg b triplet is present in f through m stars , with maximum absorption in the range k0 to m3 , and is not present in the cnm because it is a highly excited line .",
    "therefore , we can be certain that any mg b absorption we see is from a stellar atmosphere .",
    "the equivalent width of this absorption feature is also well correlated with that of the stellar na d absorption ; we can use the mg b to disjoin the stellar and interstellar sodium by fitting the na d absorption profiles with multiple components , one of which corresponds to a purely stellar feature .    using the stellar atlas of jacoby , hunter , & christian ( 1984 ) ,",
    "we have measured the equivalent widths of the mg b and na d absorption lines in a sample of stars and fit the data with a least - squares fit .",
    "we find @xmath19 this is shown with the data from the stellar atlas in figure 2 .",
    "this is consistent with the calculations of rupke et al .",
    "( 2002 ) that w(nad ) @xmath8 0.5w(mgb ) .",
    "we can use this relationship to predict the strength , width and velocity of the stellar component of the na d absorption .",
    "there are two galaxies in our sample , ngc 1569 and ngc 4449 , which have both a stellar and interstellar component .",
    "ngc 5253 has what appears to be a purely stellar component , and therefore is not included in the sample of galaxies showing interstellar neutral sodium absorption .",
    "the equivalent widths of the stellar and interstellar na d and mg b for these three galaxies are shown in figure 3 , and the spectra are presented in figure 4 .",
    "the central component of the m82 absorption profile is near the systemic velocity ( it is redshifted by only 4 km s@xmath1 ) ; however , no mg b absorption is seen to a level of 0.24   .",
    "since the equivalent width of the na d absorption in this central component is 1.44   , we can safely say that there is no significant population of cool giants and supergiants contaminating the spectrum at this position , and we will assume this component is purely interstellar .",
    "hlsa classify their `` interstellar dominated '' sample galaxies as having a larger line width than their `` strong stellar contamination '' galaxies . since our spectra are well resolved and we are able to distingush between stellar and interstellar lines , it is interesting to note that we can use this method , rather than the overall width of the absorption profile , to categorize the na d. there are only two galaxies ( ngc 1569 and ngc 4449 ) where we have both stellar and interstellar lines , and both of these absorption line systems have a larger interstellar width than stellar .",
    "similarly , hlsa found that systems with largers widths are interstellar dominated .      to discuss the kinematics of the cnm ,",
    "it is imperative to know the systemic velocity ( v@xmath20 ) of the galaxy , i.e. the heliocentric velocity of the starburst .",
    "however , one may wish to compare data with previous observations in which the velocity of the galactic center of mass was used .",
    "usually the center - of - mass velocity and the stellar velocity are similar , unless the galaxy is inclined and the starburst region is far from the axis of rotation ; this could create a velocity offset between the starburst velocity and that of the galactic nucleus . in this case , it may be better to use the velocity of the stars themselves .",
    "we were able to get stellar velocities for three galaxies ( ngc 1569 , ngc 4449 , and ngc 5253 ) by using stellar absorption lines ( see  3.1 ) . in the other five galaxies , we set the systemic velocity using ( in order of preference ) co maps ( ngc 1614 , ngc 4214 , and m82 ) , optical lines ( ngc 2363 ) , and stellar velocities ( i zw 18 ) .",
    "table 1 gives the systemic velocities used in this analysis and their sources .",
    "a heliocentric velocity scale is used throughout the paper .",
    "the hlsa sample of 32 lirgs showed significant blueshifts in the na d doublet for their `` interstellar dominated '' outflows , indicating nuclear outflows with typical velocities of @xmath8100 km s@xmath1 .",
    "our data for the dwarf galaxies also show the na d absorption to be blueshifted , although with overall slower outflow speeds ( @xmath830 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "ngc 1614 and m82 show both redshifted and blueshifted components ; these are further discussed in  4.2 .",
    "the velocities for individual interstellar absorption components are given in table 2 .",
    "the line width ( fwhm ) of the interstellar components for the dwarfs and m82 ranges from @xmath830 to @xmath880 km s@xmath1 , with an average of 43 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the existence of such broad absorption lines in neutral sodium leads us to conclude that there are multiple clouds of cold gas producing each component of the absorption ; the thermal width of a cloud of cold gas at @xmath8100 k would be only @xmath80.20 km s@xmath1 . moreover , the line widths of cold clouds in the galactic halo are found to be just a few km s@xmath1 ( spitzer & fitzpatrick 1995 ) .",
    "the individual line widths in ngc 1614 are significantly larger ( @xmath8100 km s@xmath1 or more ) than those in the dwarfs or m82 ( @xmath845 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the total width of all components in m82 is relatively large ( 236 km s@xmath1 ) .    among the dwarfs in the sample",
    ", we do not see a correlation between the fwhm of the lines and the rest - frame equivalent width .",
    "however , when the data for m82 and ngc 1614 are added , there is a trend wherein equivalent width increases in proportion to fwhm , for these n points .",
    "given the lack of correlation seen by hlsa using a much larger data set , we conclude only that the largest values of fwhm ( and similarly the largest equivalent widths ) are much smaller in dwarfs than in brighter galaxies .",
    "the doublet lines are fit with gaussian profiles in pairs with specfit to measure the velocity , fwhm , and equivalent width w of each line ( see table 2 ) .",
    "if the absorbing gas is optically thin , then the blue ( @xmath155890 ) line will be twice as strong as the red ( @xmath155896 ) line , and the `` doublet ratio , '' w@xmath21/w@xmath22 = 2 . if the gas is optically thick , w@xmath21/w@xmath22 approaches unity as the optical depth @xmath23 approaches infinity . in our data , just one component is optically thin , the rest are optically thick .",
    "we can easily measure how much of the continuum source is being obscured by absorbing gas clouds by studying the residual normalized intensity i@xmath24 of a line at wavelength @xmath15 .",
    "if i@xmath24 = 0 for the blue line of a doublet ( i.e. the stronger line ) , then no continuum radiation is `` leaking '' into the absorption line .",
    "in other words , the absorbing cloud completely covers the continuum source and the covering factor c@xmath25 = 1 .",
    "if a cloud does not cover the whole source , the continuum radiation will `` leak '' into the absorption profile and increase the minimum flux , i@xmath24 , and c@xmath25 @xmath16 1 . specifically , following the derivation of barlow & sargent ( 1997 )",
    ", we can find the covering factor : @xmath26 in our data , the covering factor ranges from 0.23 to 1.0 ( see table 2 ) .    now",
    "that we know the covering factor of the absorbing gas , we can determine the na d column density .",
    "the curve of growth relates the optical depth at line center , @xmath27 , to the doublet ratio via a function f(@xmath27 ) , determined numerically ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "the column density is then @xmath28 ( spitzer 1968 ) , where @xmath29 is the oscillator strength ( morton 1991 ) , and w@xmath24 and @xmath15 are given in angstroms .    using this method",
    ", we find that n(nad ) in the dwarfs ranges from 6.2 @xmath18 @xmath30 @xmath5 in ngc 1569 to 5.1 @xmath18 @xmath31 @xmath5 in ngc 4449 .",
    "we find the total neutral sodium column densities in ngc 1614 and m82 to be 1.0 @xmath18 @xmath32 @xmath5 and 2.4 @xmath18 @xmath31 @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the measured equivalent widths , and the calculated covering factors and na d column densities , are presented in table 2 . from the column density of sodium",
    ", we can then use the metallicity of the galaxy ( given in table 2 ; ( na / h)@xmath10 = 2.04@xmath33  martin & zalubas 1981 ) to find the total column probed .",
    "a source of systematic uncertainty is the contingence of neutral sodium column density on the ionization parameter , @xmath34 , as well as the fractional depletion of sodium onto grains , @xmath35 .",
    "since dwarfs typically have a low metallicity , we expect lower dust content and depletion level than in larger galaxies .",
    "it is the product of these , @xmath36 , which is the important factor in our calculations , as is seen in wakker & mathis ( 2000 ) .",
    "they measure the abundance of neutral sodium in galactic high- and intermediate - velocity clouds .",
    "using their results and a typical column of 10@xmath37 @xmath5 , we calculate @xmath36 = @xmath8300 .",
    "we therefore parameterize the column densities by a simple factor of ( @xmath36/100 ) to reflect the typical correction , and calculate the total column using the equation @xmath38 we find that the corresponding n ( ) in the dwarfs could be as large as 10@xmath37(@xmath39 ) @xmath5 ( ngc 1569 ) to 10@xmath40(@xmath39 ) @xmath5 ( ngc 4449 ) . in m82 and ngc 1614",
    ", this conversion gives a total column of 10@xmath41(@xmath39 ) @xmath5 and 10@xmath40(@xmath39 ) @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "in addition to na d , the resonance absorption line ( @xmath42 ) is also present in two of our spectra . and have similar ionization potentials ( 4.34 ev and 5.14 ev , respectively ) and similar depletion levels ( savage & sembach 1991 , wakker & mathis 2000 ) , so it is expected that the species will be spatially coincident in the cnm .",
    "it is unfortunate that in nearby galaxies , is found in spectral regions that are strongly contaminated by the fraunhofer a - band absorption from atmospheric o@xmath43 ( near 7600   ) . in only two galaxies",
    "were we able to discern the absorption : ngc 1569 and ngc 1614 .",
    "ngc 1569 is luckily blueshifted slightly away from the sky absorption , while ngc 1614 is redshifted out of the contaminated region entirely .",
    "other galaxies are either completely contaminated by the fraunhofer absorption , the doublet is too weak to measure , or the lines lie between echelle orders .",
    "the profile is arguably a better constraint on the cold gas kinematics than the na d profile because the doublet spacing is wider , and the oscillator strength is lower so the lines are less saturated .",
    "we fit the profile in ngc 1614 with specfit and found components at -149 km s@xmath1 and + 70 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this result helped us pin down the best component velocities for the na d fits , which were previously poorly constrained . due to the low signal - to - noise of the continuum ,",
    "the doublet ratio and covering factor are uncertain .",
    "the results of the fitting are presented in table 3 .    without the addition of",
    ", the na d profile for ngc 1569 is blended with galactic absorption and atmospheric emission . the stellar profile from the starburst",
    "is constrained by absorption , leaving a range of possibilities for the central velocity of the interstellar na d. we find absorption at -24 km s@xmath1 , thereby defining the velocity at which the interstellar na d lies .",
    "due to the fraunhofer absorption , the normalization of the continuum in the ngc 1569 spectrum is likely imperfect and the column densities in table 3 are highly uncertain",
    ". the spectra do not provide a useful column density constraint .",
    "although we sample just one sightline , we can estimate how much of the cnm is brought out into the outflow , if any .",
    "only five of the sample galaxies show interstellar sodium absorption , just three of which are dwarfs . due to the intricacies in geometry and modeling of the individual galaxies , as well as the small number of sample galaxies ,",
    "it is preferable to look at each galaxy individually .",
    "below we discuss the galaxies independently , detailing the information gleaned from their spectra , and presenting a model of the starburst kinematics and any outflow / infall structure .",
    "ideally , we would like to be able to calculate the amount of cold , neutral gas flowing into the igm , when possible .",
    "this requires knowledge not only of the kinematics and column densities , but also the geometry of the starbursting region itself .",
    "one important application of measuring the column density of a superbubble or shell region around a starburst is to measure the mass of gas being expelled from the starburst .",
    "we can do this , so long as we make a few assumptions .",
    "we use the wind / bubble model introduced by weaver et al .",
    "( 1977 ) , wherein a starburst is surrounded by concentric shells of ( in order of increasing radius ) a free - flowing wind , a shocked wind , and a shocked shell of neutral ism .",
    "the strmgren sphere of the stars may be trapped in the shell , or may completely photoionize the region .",
    "we postulate that the h@xmath14 emission is found in the warm , dense ionized gas region , while the na d absorption is found in the colder , shocked neutral gas region .",
    "this model is applicable in light of the expanding shells of warm gas seen in h@xmath14 images by martin 1998 .",
    "we assume the shells are perfectly spherical , making the mass a function of the column density within the shell and the area of the shell . given a shell of radius r",
    ", the mass of the shell in neutral hydrogen is @xmath44 all of the following models use parameters ( r , z / z@xmath10 ) as are detailed in table 4 and column densities as given in table 3 and transformed into n ( ) using equation 4 .",
    "the column densities assume ionization fractions and depletion parameters as discussed in  3.3 , namely that @xmath45 .",
    "the sightline to ngc1569 intersects the midplane of the disk .",
    "we observe the shell 1569-c in h@xmath14 at a radius of @xmath83 ",
    "( 32 pc ) from the continuum source .",
    "this is most likely the same region in which mhle et al .",
    "( 2001 ) parameterized an `` hole , '' associated with the starburst , 1 kpc in diameter expanding at 7 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the neutral gas outflow we observe in the nearby dwarf galaxy ngc 1569 is moving more slowly than the bipolar outflow seen in h@xmath14 by martin ( 1998 ) .",
    "if we assume the neutral sodium is spatially coincident with the edge of this hole , i.e. the neutral sodium is swept up in a slowly expanding shell around the starbursting area , then we find the total mass of cold , neutral gas swept up to be @xmath46 m@xmath47 . the mass of this galaxy is found from radio observations to be @xmath48 m@xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the neutral gas in the shell modeled is a small fraction ( @xmath4910% ) of the total neutral gas mass of the galaxy .",
    "martin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) imaged ngc 1569 in x - rays with _",
    "chandra _ and argued that the observed outflowing wind is strong enough to blow through the galactic halo .",
    "in fact , they found that nearly all of the metals ejected by the starburst are carried into the igm by the galactic superwind , and are primarily from the stellar ejecta itself , not the entrained ism .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that this galaxy shows the smallest amount of outflowing neutral gas of our entire sample .",
    "the outflowing mass is measured to be @xmath50 m@xmath10 in hot gas and @xmath51 m@xmath10 in warm gas ( martin 1998 ) .",
    "in contrast , we find @xmath52 m@xmath10 in for a 500 pc ( radius ) shell .    from mg b band absorption",
    "we know there must be a stellar component of the na d profile at the systemic velocity . by fitting a corresponding stellar component to the na d profile , and by fitting the atmospheric absorption and galactic emission , we find there is one interstellar absorption component required for a good fit ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "this gas , blueshifted 24 km s@xmath1 from the systemic , corresponds to the absorption seen at the same velocity .",
    "we use a value of v@xmath20 = -40 km s@xmath53 0.6 km s@xmath1 , obtained from the mg b band absorption in the stellar atmospheres within the starburst .",
    "it is important to note that our value of the systemic velocity is somewhat lower than the typical values for this galaxy : meier et al .",
    "( 2001 ) used @xmath54co to find a systemic velocity of -68 km s@xmath1 , while stil & israel ( 2002 ) used the galaxy s rotation curve to find a mean systemic velocity of -82 km s@xmath1 .",
    "in fact , when comparing the heliocentric velocity of the na d with the above values of the systemic velocity , it is possible that while the na d is blueshifted in relation to the , it may be at the systemic velocity or even redshifted .",
    "additional uncertainty in the analysis of the cold interstellar gas arises from possible absorption by neutral gas in intervening galactic intermediate- or high - velocity clouds ( kuntz & danly 1996 ) .",
    "moreover , in the galactic thin disk is seen towards ngc 1569 ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) , and could overlap in velocity with the lines from ngc 1569 .",
    "we observed ngc 1614 in order to extend our observations beyond the scale of dwarf galaxies and into a higher luminosity class .",
    "this relatively close lirg ( d = 64 mpc for h@xmath55 = 75 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 ) has a violent starburst in the central region which is thought to have been triggered by interaction with another massive galaxy , as evidenced by outer structures including plumes , tails , and a possible secondary nucleus as seen by alonso - herrero et al .",
    "we observe the primary / nuclear starburst .",

    "the region we observe is the center of the h@xmath14 emission ( hunter et al .",

    "this is still a large amount of mass , so this is by no means a definitive statement that there is no expanding shell ; our sightline simply misses the shells as shown in martin 1998 ( figure 2@xmath87 in that paper ) .",
    "the mass of ngc 5253 is roughly @xmath88 m@xmath10 ( kobulnicky & skillman 1995 ) , indicating that the mass of cold outflowing gas detected is small compared to the total neutral gas mass of the galaxy .",

    "we can make an educated guess on the distance from the continuum source to the absorbing gas by using the ages derived from h@xmath14 shell expansion in martin ( 1998 ) , and find the dynamical age of the shells to be @xmath88 myr .",
    "this gives shell sizes on the order of a few hundred pc .",
    "assuming solar metallicity , we can find the mass expelled in the simple case of independently expanding spheres .",
    "the shells range in neutral gas mass from @xmath90 m@xmath91 to @xmath92 m@xmath93 .",
    "these are relatively small compared to the other similarly luminous galaxies where absorption is detected ; it should be noted that the radii given , and therefore the masses , are a lower limit .",
    "i zw 18 is important to study due to its extremely low metallicity - o / h @xmath94 0.02(o / h)@xmath10 - and high column , making it a prime candidate for a young galaxy undergoing its first phase of star formation ( lequeux et al . 1979 ) .",
    "moreover , the galaxy has a relatively low escape velocity , and feedback from star formation could drastically affect the galaxy ( martin 1996 ) .",
    "we observed i zw 18 hoping to see absorption from cold gas in the largest region in the galaxy .",
    "however , we see no na d absorption and our spectra show a relatively featureless continuum , with a prominent hydrogen balmer series and weak emission from [ ] ( @xmath04363 , 4959 , 5007 ) , and only the stronger line from the [ ] doublet at @xmath156716 .",

    "interstellar neutral sodium column densities were obtained by measuring the equivalent width of the na d absorption doublet .",
    "we find that out of the eight galaxies , ngc 1569 , ngc 1614 , ngc 4214 - 2 , ngc 4449 , and m82 unambiguously show interstellar sodium absorption , while ngc 2363 , ngc 4214 - 1 , ngc 5253 , and i zw 18 do not .",
    "the dwarf galaxies ngc 1569 , ngc 4214 , and ngc 4449 exhibit single - component outflows of neutral gas .",

    "it is particularly interesting to see how complex the absorption line spectra become at high resolution .",
    "m82 is an excellent example of an absorption line system previously believed to be a single pair of lines , but within each member of the doublet we find a wealth of structure .",
    "we resolve at least five line pairs , showing the incredibly complicated nature of the cnm in this galaxy .",
    "this is a very intriguing result and prompts us to wonder how many of the galaxies in previous samples could be resolved into complex systems of multiple components .",
    "ngc 1614 shows complex absorption as well , though it has a far smoother profile in na d ( and ) than m82 .",
    "the three dwarfs with outflows do not seem to exhibit this behavior , showing far simpler spectra .",

    ", we can determine whether the ionization front is trapped inside the shock front .",
    "this works extremely well for ngc 2363 , which is a simple expanding bubble with an ionization front that has expanded beyond the shock front .",
    "ngc 4214 - 2 also presents a relatively simple shell , and this galaxy also shows na d absorption . from the kinematics we postulate that the ionization front is expanding faster than the shock front , though it has clearly not `` caught up '' yet , as there is still a concentric , outer expanding bubble of cold , neutral gas .",
    "in other words , the ionization front is still trapped in the shell .",
    "the kinematics of na d and h@xmath14 are very different in other galaxies , and can not be easily explained by this straightforward picture .    combining our measurements of column density with previous observations of superbubbles and supershells in the sample galaxies , we have parameterized the mass of neutral gas ( or a limiting case thereof ) flowing out of the starbursting region . using a simple spherical shell model , we find the total neutral gas outflow masses to be roughly 10@xmath9 to 10@xmath11 m@xmath10 .",
    "ngc 4449 shows far more outflowing cold gas than any other dwarf galaxy .",
    "compared to the measurements of outflowing warm and hot gas from these galaxies ( martin 1998 ) , it is likely that the bulk of the energy in the outflow is carried by the warm and hot gas , rather than cold gas .",

    "<S> we have obtained high resolution echelle spectra ( r = 30,000 - 50,000 ) of the na d absorption doublet ( @xmath05890 , 5896 ) for six dwarf starburst galaxies and two more luminous starbursts : m82 and ngc 1614 . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption features were separated into multiple components and separated into stellar and interstellar parts based on kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that three of the dwarfs show outflows , with an average blueshift of 27 km s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is small compared to the highest velocity components in ngc 1614 and m82 ( blueshifted by 150 km s@xmath1 and 91 km s@xmath1 , respectively ) ; these two brighter galaxies also show more complex absorption profiles than the dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> none of the outflow speeds clearly exceed the escape velocity of the host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> sightlines in ngc 2363 and ngc4214 apparently intersect expanding shells . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the shocked gas velocity ( v@xmath2 ) to the ionized gas velocity ( v@xmath3 ) and interpret the velocity difference as either a trapped ionization front ( ngc 4214 ) or a leaky region ( ngc 2363 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dwarfs show n@xmath2 = 10@xmath4 @xmath5 , while the na d columns in m82 and ngc 1614 are 10@xmath6 @xmath5 and 10@xmath7 @xmath5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of expelled gas is highly sensitive to outflow geometry , dust depletion , and ionization fraction , but with a simple shell model we estimate neutral outflow gas masses from @xmath810@xmath9 m@xmath10 to @xmath810@xmath11 m@xmath10 . </S>"
