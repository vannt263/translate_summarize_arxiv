    "elastography @xcite aims to provide a quantitative visualization of the mechanical properties of human tissues by using the relation between the wave propagation velocity and the mechanical properties of the tissues . during the last three decades , elastography led to significant improvements in the quantitative evaluation of tissue stiffness",
    "the two major elastographic techniques are based on ultrasound @xcite and on magnetic resonance imaging @xcite .",
    "ge healthcare has recently commercialized magnetic resonance elastography ( mre ) .",
    "its main use is to assess mechanical changes in liver tissue .",
    "the mechanical properties of tissue include the shear modulus , shear viscosity , and compression modulus @xcite .",
    "quantification of the tissue shear modulus _ in vivo _ can provide evidence of the manifestation of tissue diseases . for centuries",
    ", palpation has been widely used to identify tissue abnormalities and estimate the mechanical properties of tissue .",
    "therefore , it is surprising that the concept of remote palpation , which is the remote imaging of tissue stiffness , was first developed only in the late 1980s @xcite .",
    "although significant progress has been made in the development of shear modulus imaging technology , problems remain image quality relating to the enhancement of images of local tissue shear viscosity and shear modulus @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on the image reconstruction methods for tissue viscoelasticity imaging . to simplify the underlying inverse problem ,",
    "the reconstruction of both the shear modulus and shear viscosity are considered under the assumption of isotropic elastic moduli .",
    "this work considers the inverse problem of recovering the distribution of the shear modulus ( @xmath0 ) and shear viscosity ( @xmath1 ) from the internal measurement of the time - harmonic mechanical displacement field @xmath2 produced by the application of an external time harmonic excitation at frequency @xmath3 in the range @xmath4hz through the surface of the subject .",
    "modeling soft tissue as being linearly viscoelastic and nearly incompressible , the displacement @xmath2 satisfies the elasticity equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the density of the medium , @xmath7 is the transpose of the matrix @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the compression modulus and @xmath10 is the compression viscosity .",
    "the most widely used reconstruction method is the algebraic inversion method @xcite : for any non - zero constant vector @xmath11 , @xmath12 which requires the strong assumptions of @xmath13 ( local homogeneity ) and @xmath14 ( negligible pressure ) .    the algebraic formula ( [ eq : directinversion ] ) ignores reflection effects of the propagating wave due to abrupt changes of @xmath15 , so that the method can not measure any change of @xmath15 in the direction of @xmath11 @xcite .    to deal with these fundamental drawbacks in the algebraic inversion method , the shear modulus decomposition algorithm based on helmholtz - hodge decomposition",
    "was developed in @xcite .",
    "this is a much better performing method ; however , it continues to neglect pressure by using @xmath16 , and is thus not realistic . in @xcite ,",
    "the curl operator is applied to the elasticity equation ( [ eq : viscoelasticity ] ) to eliminate the troublesome term ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the reconstruction method in @xcite requires third - order derivatives of the noisy data @xmath2 , making it very sensitive to noise in the data .",
    "a realistic model must take into account the non - vanishing pressure @xmath18 @xcite , which can be defined roughly as @xmath19 .    the shear viscoelasticity reconstruction method proposed in this paper",
    "is based on the full elasticity model .",
    "it does not require any derivative of @xmath2 .",
    "the minimization of a misfit functional involving the discrepancy between the measured and fitted data is considered .",
    "the frchet derivatives of the functional with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath1 are then computed by introducing an adjoint problem .",
    "this frchet derivatives based - iterative scheme requires a well - matched initial guess , because the minimization problem is highly nonlinear and may have multiple local minima .",
    "we find a well - matched initial guess that captures the edges of the image of the shear viscoelasticity .",
    "the numerical results presented herein demonstrate the viability and efficiency of the proposed minimization method .",
