    "<S> these methods in combination with distinct features of ultra - cold matter systems allow us to monitor and analyze excitation dynamics in both the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> they are _ independent _ of system size , and can therefore reliably probe systems where , e.g. , quantum state tomography becomes prohibitively expensive . </S>",
    "<S> we propose signals that can probe steady state currents , detect the influence of anharmonicities on phonon transport , and identify signatures of chaotic dynamics near a quantum phase transition in an ising - type spin chain . </S>"
