    "the problem of reliability of a large distributed system is analyzed in the present paper via a new mathematical model .",
    "a typical framework is a system where files are duplicated on several data servers .",
    "when a server breaks down , all copies of files stored on this server are lost but they can be retrieved if copies of the same files are stored on other servers . in the case when no other copy of a given file is present in the network , it is definitively lost .",
    "failures of disks occur naturally in this context , these events are quite rare but , given the large number of nodes of these large systems , this is not a negligible phenomenon at all at network scale .",
    "see the measurements at google in pinheiro et al .",
    "@xcite for example .    in order to maintain copies on distant servers ,",
    "a fraction @xmath1 of the bandwidth of each server has to be devoted to the duplication mechanism of its files to other servers .",
    "if , for a short period of time , several of the servers break down , it may happen that files will be lost for good just because all the available copies were on these servers and because a recovery procedure was not completed before the last copy disappeared .",
    "the natural critical parameters of such a distributed system with @xmath0 servers are the failure rate @xmath2 of servers and the bandwidth @xmath1 allocated to duplication of a given server and the total number of initial files @xmath3 .",
    "the quantity @xmath1 represents the amount of capacity that a server allocate to make duplication to enhance the durability of the network .",
    "if there are initially too many files in the system , the duplication capacity at each node may not be able to cope with the losses due to successive failures of servers and , therefore , a significant fraction of files will be lost very quickly .",
    "an efficient storage system should be able to maximize the average number of files @xmath4 per server and , at the same time , the durability , i.e. the first instant @xmath5 when a fraction @xmath6 of files which are definitely lost .",
    "a lot of work in computer science has been devoted to the design and the implementation of duplication algorithms .",
    "these systems are known as distributed hash tables ( dht ) .",
    "they play an important role in the development of some large scale distributed systems quite popular right now like in cloud computing , see rhea et al .",
    "@xcite and rowstron and druschel  @xcite for example . except extensive simulations ,",
    "little has been done to evaluate the performances of these algorithms .",
    "several approaches have been used to investigate the corresponding mathematical models .",
    "simplified models using birth and death processes have been used quite often , see chun et al .",
    "@xcite , picconi et al .",
    "@xcite and ramabhadran and pasquale  @xcite . in feuillet and robert",
    "@xcite and sun et al .",
    "@xcite , an important simplification is done concerning the duplication mechanism .",
    "if there are @xmath0 servers and each of them has an available bandwidth @xmath1 to duplicate files , then the total capacity for duplication is @xmath7 .",
    "it is assumed in these works that the duplication capacity can be used globally , i.e. the rate at which copies are created is @xmath7 and that it can be used for any file in the system . with these assumptions , a markovian model with a fixed state space of dimension",
    "@xmath8 has been investigated ( @xmath9 is the maximum number of copies of a file in the system ) : if , for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the number of files with @xmath13 copies , then the vector @xmath14 is a markov process on @xmath15 under the hypothesis that the files with the least number of copies are duplicated first at rate @xmath7 as in  @xcite for example . in this way the mathematical representation of the network",
    "is simplified since it is not necessary to know the locations of the copies of any file to derive the corresponding stochastic evolution equations .    in  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that in this setting the variable @xmath5 was of the order of @xmath16 for a large @xmath0 under some conditions .",
    "limit theorems were established for the rescaled process @xmath17 by using various technical estimations and by proving a stochastic averaging principle .      in this paper ,",
    "the duplication capacity is assumed to be local , any server has a capacity to duplicate but it can only be used on the copies present on the server .",
    "it can not be used to copy files of other servers as it is case for models with a global duplication capacity .",
    "the locations of the copies have therefore to be included in a possible markovian model of the network . due to",
    "this localized duplication capacity one can not expect , intuitively , that the average lifetime of a file will grow significantly with @xmath0 as in the case of a global duplication capacity .",
    "nevertheless , as we will see , a scaling analysis , with a large number of nodes , simplifies significantly the corresponding mathematical models which are otherwise intractable up to now .     servers , files with one copy are in blue and files with two copies are in red and their two copies are connected with a link . ]      without any duplication policy , it is not difficult to see that a given file with @xmath9 initial copies has still at least one copy at time @xmath18 with a probability of the order of @xmath19 for a large @xmath18 if @xmath2 is the failure rate of servers . if initially there are @xmath20 files all with @xmath21 copies scattered in the network , the average number of files with at least a copy at time @xmath18 is thus of the order of @xmath22 .",
    "the central question is how a duplication capacity can improve these poor performances . in the case of a global duplication capacity of the order of @xmath7 , the main result of sun et al .",
    "@xcite is that the convenient time scale to see a significant decay of the fraction of files `` alive '' , i.e. when it is strictly below @xmath23 , is @xmath24 .    with a local duplication capacity ,",
    "such a phenomenon can not be expected , the duplication capacity available to a given file is necessarily bounded .",
    "for this reason the decay of the system should occur on the `` normal '' time scale @xmath25 .",
    "the main aim of this paper is of investigating the exponential decay rate of the total number of files .",
    "more specifically we are interested in the existence of @xmath26 possibly depending on @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath23 and @xmath9 such that the probability that a given file is still alive at time @xmath18 is given by @xmath27 of course duplication is of interest if @xmath28 and in fact is as close to @xmath29 as possible .",
    "this is the key problem of these systems in our view .      as it will be seen getting mathematical quantitative results to estimate such a coefficient @xmath30 is quite challenging .",
    "to give an idea of the difficulty of getting an asymptotic results on the corresponding mathematical models , for simplicity , one assumes for the moment that the maximum number of possible copies of a given file is @xmath31 . in this setting , a natural markovian model of this network",
    "can be as follows .",
    "if there are @xmath0 servers , for @xmath32 , one denotes by @xmath33 the number of files which have copies on server @xmath13 and @xmath34 at time @xmath18 , and @xmath35 is the number of files having only one copy located on server @xmath13 .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath36 is a markov process and that it is a minimal description of the evolution of the network .",
    "the state space is of dimension @xmath37 which grows with @xmath0 , contrary to the case of models with global duplication capacity with a bounded dimension .",
    "for this reason , the scaling techniques of our previous papers  @xcite can not be used in this setting .    due to symmetry of the interaction between the nodes , a possible approach in this context",
    "is of using mean - field convergence results by considering the evolution of the empirical distribution , i.e. the evolution of the state of a given random node . under appropriate conditions , this process is a markov process but on a state space of dimension @xmath0 instead of @xmath37 because the state of node @xmath13 is given by the @xmath0 variables @xmath38 .",
    "it is still not convenient to study the asymptotic behavior of the network when @xmath0 gets large .",
    "a further dimension reduction is proposed .",
    "each node @xmath13 is represented only by two variables : the number of files whose unique copy is on server @xmath13 and the number of files with two copies and one of the copies is on @xmath13 .",
    "the empirical distribution associated to such a representation has values in the fixed state space of probability distributions on @xmath39 ( two integer valued variables give the state of the node ) .",
    "this dimension reduction comes at a price , the loss of the markov property .",
    "we prove nevertheless that this non - markovian description of the network is converging in distribution , as @xmath0 goes to infinity , to a nonlinear markov process , @xmath40 satisfying the following fokker - planck equation @xmath41{\\mathbbm{1}_{\\left\\{\\overline{r}_1(t)>0\\right\\}}}\\right)\\\\      + \\lambda \\p(\\overline{r}_1(t)>0)\\e\\left(\\left[\\rule{0mm}{4mm}f(\\overline{r}(t)+e_2)-f(\\overline{r}(t))\\right]\\right)\\\\      + \\mu \\e\\left(\\left[\\rule{0mm}{4mm}f(0,0)-f(\\overline{r}(t))\\right]\\right )      + \\mu\\e\\left(\\left[\\rule{0mm}{4mm}f(\\overline{r}(t)+e_1-e_2)-f(\\overline{r}(t))\\right]\\overline{r}_2(t)\\right),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is a function with finite support on @xmath39 .",
    "the nonlinear term of this functional equation is given by the coefficient @xmath45 .",
    "this asymptotic markov process is transient , it is converging to the absorbing state , a dirac measure at @xmath46 , corresponding to a system without any file left . on the technical side , the proofs of the main results rely essentially on several ingredients : careful stochastic calculus with marked poisson processes , several technical estimates ( lemma  [ tech ] and an exponential estimate in the proof of proposition  [ uniqprop ] for example ) and mean - field results .",
    "section  [ ext - sec ] discusses the case when the maximum number @xmath9 of copies of a file is greater than @xmath47 . by using a simpler stochastic model , for which a mean - field limit result also holds ,",
    "a multi - dimensional analogue of the set of equations   is introduced and analyzed .",
    "it is in particular shown that the maximal eigenvalue of a @xmath48 matrix is playing the role of the @xmath30 mentioned above .",
    "the use of the reduced representation seems to be quite promising to study these large distributed systems . in this paper ,",
    "the duplication algorithm analyzed chooses a server at random to make a copy of one of the files of a server @xmath49 . in practice ,",
    "the server is chosen at random but on a local neighborhood of server @xmath13 , the leafset , see rowstron and druschel  @xcite for example .",
    "this is another aspect which is usually forgotten in most of mathematical models of these systems .",

    "moreover , by another use of the exchangeability of files and the mean field convergence results for the @xmath410-system , we have @xmath487 for a constant @xmath324 that does not depend on @xmath18 . in particular , we have proved the following asymptotic lower bound on the exponential decay of the average number of files alive at time @xmath18 .",
    "remark . note that , with the same notations as before , if the initial number of file @xmath3 is such that @xmath489 , we have also shown that @xmath490 the exponential decay rate of the network is thus related to the exponential tail of @xmath491 , the time to absorption of a transient birth and death process @xmath492 on @xmath493 starting from @xmath9 . on the theoretical side , there is nothing really new , since it is well known that the function @xmath494 is also the solution of a linear system of odes .",
    "see section  3.3 of norris  @xcite for example .",
    "the interesting part is the fact that birth and death processes are often used in the literature to get approximations on the durability of these systems , not for to estimate exponential decay rates , but for getting the mean values of hitting times .",
    "see , for example , ramabhadran and pasquale  @xcite , chun et al .",
    "@xcite and picconi et al .",
    "the approximation generally consists in describing the number of copies of a file as a birth and death process whose parameters are estimated via experiments with a real system .",
    "it should be noted that our @xmath410-system is close to the linear model investigated through experiments in picconi et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a set of experiments for @xmath31 has been done to compare the exponential decay of the @xmath410-system of corollary  [ s - prop ] given by @xmath455 of proposition  [ up - prop ] and the exponential decay @xmath495 of simulations of the real system .",
    "the parameters were the following : the number of initial files is @xmath496 initially ( all with two copies ) , the number of servers is @xmath497 and the failure rate of a server is @xmath498 , @xmath362 is the parameter used as a variable .",
    "the parameter @xmath495 has been estimated with a linear least squares method for the tail of the log of the number of files , when the total number of files is between @xmath499 and @xmath500 in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "our experiments show that the estimation of @xmath495 is quite robust for repeated simulations with the same parameters .",
    "servers and @xmath501 initial files and with @xmath502 , @xmath503 and @xmath498 . for these parameters ,",
    "the linear approximation is @xmath504 with @xmath505 and @xmath506.,title=\"fig : \" ] ( -167,195)linear approximation    table  [ tab1 ] shows that the accuracy of @xmath455 to estimate @xmath495 is reasonably good for sufficiently large values of @xmath462 . for small values of @xmath462 ,",

    "<S> the duplication process is assumed to be local , any server has a capacity to make copies to another server but it can only be used for the copies present on this server , contrary to previous models of the literature for which the duplication capacity could be used globally .    </S>",
    "<S> we study the asymptotic behavior of this system in a mean - field context , i.e. when the number @xmath0 of servers is large . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is complicated by the large dimension of the state space of the empirical distribution of the state of the network . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a stochastic model of the evolution of the network which has values in state space whose dimension does not depend on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this description does not have the markov property but it turns out that it is converging in distribution , as @xmath0 gets large , to a nonlinear markov process . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , this asymptotic process gives a limiting result on the rate of decay of the network which is the key characteristic of interest of these systems . </S>",
