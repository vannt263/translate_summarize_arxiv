    "it has long been realized that the full understanding of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) requires multi - wavelength observations as close together in time as possible .",
    "the unique capabilities of the swift gamma - ray burst explorer @xcite allow such observations to be carried out rapidly and with high sensitivity at x - ray energies ranging from 0.3  kev to @xmath5350  kev .",
    "when a grb is also detected simultaneously with the konus instrument @xcite on wind , one also obtains spectral and temporal data up to @xmath610  mev , providing a complete picture of the prompt emission over nearly two orders of magnitude in energy .",
    "when a spectroscopic redshift is not available , it is possible to use features of the prompt emission to constrain estimates of the burst redshift . in particular",
    ", @xcite noted that pulse peaks migrate to later times as they become wider at low energies .",
    "this spectral lag was found to be proportional to the total peak luminosity of the burst , and can be used along with the peak flux and the peak of the @xmath0  spectrum , or @xmath2 to constrain the absolute luminosity and hence the redshift of the burst . also @xcite and @xcite",
    "have shown that @xmath2  when converted to the grb rest frame is proportional to isotropic energy @xcite or peak luminosity @xcite .",
    "after a few hundred seconds , the prompt gamma - ray emission has decayed and the spectrum has softened to the point where high energy photons are no longer detectable .",
    "however , with a sensitive instrument such as the x - ray telescope on swift , this late phase can often be detected in x - rays for many days after the initial burst .",
    "several authors @xcite have presented a unified picture of the time evolution of the early x - ray emission . in this unified picture",
    ", the initial decay component has a steep time decay function where the emission is dominated by the tail of the internal shock emission @xcite , followed by a shallower component where the fireball has decelerated and emission is dominated by the forward shock @xcite .    the long , bright grb 050717 was detected by both the burst alert telescope ( bat ) @xcite on swift @xcite and the konus instrument on wind @xcite , allowing simultaneous observations from 14  kev to 14  mev .",
    "the burst was long enough that it was still detectable in swift - bat for @xmath660 seconds after it became visible to the swift x - ray telescope ( xrt ) .",
    "the xrt continued to observe the afterglow until 7.1 days after the trigger and it was detectable out to 1.4 days .",
    "no optical transient was found in spite of deep long wavelength searches within 14 hours of the grb .    in this paper",
    "we describe the prompt and afterglow properties of grb 050717 , starting with a description of the swift , konus and various optical follow - up observations in section  [ sec2 ] , and continuing in section  [ sec3 ] with a discussion of the light curves and spectroscopy from the prompt through the late post - burst phase . in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we discuss the implications of these observations , and in particular note the extremely high value of @xmath2  and unusually short value of the spectral lag .",
    "we shall show that while grb 050717 is a classical long grb , based on its spectral and temporal properties , it exhibits several highly unusual and noteworthy features which may constrain burst models .",
    "at 10:30:52.21 ut , 17 july , 2005 , the swift bat triggered and located on - board grb 050717 ( bat trigger 146372 ) @xcite . unless otherwise specified , times in this article are referenced to the bat trigger time , ( ut 10:30:52.21 ) hereafter designated t@xmath7 .",
    "the burst was detected in the part of the bat field of view that was 55% coded , meaning that it was 36@xmath8 off - axis and only 55% of the bat detectors were illuminated by the source .",
    "the spacecraft began to slew to the source location 8.66 seconds after the trigger and was settled at the source location at t@xmath7 + 63.46 seconds .",
    "the bat data for grb 050717 between t@xmath7 - 300 s and t@xmath7 + 300 s were collected in event mode with 100 @xmath9s time resolution and @xmath56  kev energy resolution .",
    "the data were processed using standard swift - bat analysis tools and the spectra were fit using xspec 11.3 .",
    "each bat event was mask - tagged using batmaskwtevt with the best fit source position .",
    "mask - tagging is a technique in which each event is weighted by a factor representing the fractional exposure to the source through the bat coded aperture .",
    "a weight of + 1 corresponds to a fully open detector and a weight of -1 to a fully blocked detector .",
    "flux from the background and other sources averages to zero with this method .",
    "all of the bat grb light curves shown have been background subtracted by this method .",
    "this method is effective even when the spacecraft is moving since complete aspect information is available during the maneuver .",
    "the mask - weighting is also applied to produce weighted , background subtracted counts spectra using the tool batbinevt . since the response matrix depends on the position of the source in the bat field of view , separate matrices are derived for before the slew , after the slew and for individual segments of the light curve during the slew .",
    "the long hard grb 050717 triggered konus - wind ( k - w ) @xcite at t@xmath7(k - w ) = 10:30:57.426 ut .",
    "it was detected by the s1 detector which observes the south ecliptic hemisphere ; the incident angle was @xmath10 .",
    "the propagation delay from swift to wind is 2.369  s for this grb , _",
    "i.e. _ , correcting for this factor , one sees that the k - w trigger time corresponds to t@xmath7 + 2.86  s. the data before t@xmath7(k - w)-0.512  s were collected in the waiting mode with 2.944  s time resolution . from t@xmath7(k - w ) to t@xmath7(k - w)+430.848  s , 64 spectra in 101 channels were accumulated .",
    "the first 4 spectra were accumulated on a 64-ms time scale , then the spectra accumulation times were varied from 5.120  s to 8.192  s adapting to the current burst intensity .",
    "data were processed using standard konus - wind analysis tools and the spectra were fitted by xspec 11.3 . as observed by konus - wind grb 050717",
    "had a steep rise and a long decaying tail .",
    "the spacecraft slewed immediately to the bat location of grb 050717 and the xrt began observing the burst at 10:32:11.49 ut ( approximately 79 seconds after the bat trigger ) .",
    "the automated on - board xrt software was unable to centroid on the burst , however , the downlinked x - ray spectrum and light curve clearly showed a bright fading x - ray object in the field .",
    "xrt observations @xcite began in windowed timing ( wt ) mode ( see below ) 91 seconds after the trigger before going into photon counting ( pc ) mode at 310  s. the coordinates of the burst were determined by the xrt to be ( j2000 ) : ra:@xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , dec : @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) ( the 90% confidence error circle radius is 3.5 arc seconds ) @xcite .",

    "e.g _ @xcite .",
    "this instrument has three key functions : the rapid , automated and accurate determination of grb positions , the provision of moderate resolution spectroscopy ( energy resolution 140 ev at 5.9 kev ) , and recording grb light curves over a wide dynamic range covering more than seven orders of magnitude in flux .",
    "the wt readout mode of the xrt uses a restricted portion of the telescope s total field of view : the central 8 arcmin ( or 200 columns ) , when the grb flux is below @xmath55000  mcrab .",
    "each column is clocked continously to provide timing information with 1.8  ms resolution . however , this rapid readout mode only preserves imaging information in one dimension .",
    "once the grb flux drops below @xmath51  mcrab the pc mode takes over .",
    "this mode retains full imaging and spectroscopic information with a readout time of 2.5  s.    data for this burst were obtained from the swift quick look website   and processed with version 2 of the swift software .",
    "the xselect program was used to extract source and background spectra and cleaned event lists ( 0.310.0  kev ) , using xselect grades 012 for pc mode data and grades 02 for wt data .",
    "the pc mode suffers from pile - up when the count rate is @xmath16  0.8 counts s@xmath17 . to counter this we extracted a series of grade",
    "012 background corrected spectra from the first 8.6  ks of pc mode data using annuli of varying inner radii .",
    "we deem the point at which pile - up no longer affects our results to be when the spectral shape no longer varies with an increase in annular radius . for grb 050717",
    "this occurred when we excluded the inner 12 pixels ( radius ) .",
    "only the first 500  s of pc mode data suffered from pile - up .",

    "the light curve was created by the same method as detailed in @xcite .",
    "observations with the swift ultra violet / optical telescope ( uvot ) began at 10:32:10.7 ut ( 78 seconds after the bat trigger ) @xcite .",
    "the first datum taken after the spacecraft settled was a 100  s exposure using the v filter with the midpoint of the observation at 128 s after the bat trigger .",
    "no new source was detected within the xrt error circle in summed images in any of the six filters down to the 3@xmath18 magnitude upper limits shown in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "grb 050717 was not well positioned for follow - up observations .",
    "its high southern declination made it unobservable by most northern hemisphere telescopes and the trigger was just before dawn at the south american observatories .",
    "consequently , no follow - up optical observations were made until more than 13 hours after the burst . in the several observations that were made after this time",
    ", no optical counterpart was detected .    under the control of skynet ,",

    "no new source was detected within the xrt error circle of grb 050717 down to the dss-2r limiting magnitude .",
    "the bat triggered on the first of two short , small spikes that preceded the main emission of grb 050717 .",
    "this first spike at t@xmath7  was very soft ( photon power - law spectral index 2.89 @xmath3 0.14 ) and lasted 128 ms .",
    "the second short spike began at t@xmath7 + 0.7 s , was of longer duration ( 320 ms ) and was much harder ( photon index 1.36 @xmath3 0.23 ) .",

    "these small precursors were followed by the main pulse , which displayed the common fast rise , exponential decay ( fred ) profile .",
    "the intensity rose from background to peak within 450 ms then began to decay with an average exponential decay constant @xmath22 .",

    "this is shown in the lower panels of fig  [ fig1 ] . starting with the main peak",

    "then after t@xmath7 + 91 s , the bat spectrum hardens again .",
    "the fit to the bat data only over t@xmath7 + 91 to t@xmath7 + 150 s yields a power - law photon index of 1.08 @xmath30.32 .",
    "a joint fit to the bat and xrt data over the same time period ( see section  [ xrt ] ) gives a photon index of 1.61 @xmath3 0.08 . the low bat flux at these times limits statistically meaningful fits to the entire interval",
    ". however , given the spectral variation demonstrated earlier in the burst , it is quite possible that there is spectral evolution occurring at these times as well and the overall spectral fits should be interpreted with caution .      the konus - wind light curve is shown in three energy bands in fig  [ fig2 ] , and the 211300 kev light curve ( see fig  [ fig2a ] ) is similar to the swift - bat light curve . the long decaying tail is clearly seen in g1 band ( 2184  kev ) , marginally seen in g2 band ( 84360  kev ) , and not seen in g3 band ( 3601370  kev ) .",

    "the mean unabsorbed flux in wt mode at 201 s ( mean time ) is @xmath48 erg @xmath25 s@xmath17 in the 0.3 - 10.0 kev energy range .    during the period between t@xmath7 + 91 s and t@xmath7 + 150 s",
    ", a joint fit was made to the xrt and bat data .",
    "the joint fit gives a photon index of @xmath49 , with an excess absorption of @xmath50 @xmath51  for 115 d.o.f . ) .",
    "this fit was used to extrapolate the bat 15 - 150 kev flux into the xrt energy range ( 0.310 kev ) during the overlap interval assuming that the 1.61 power law index holds in both energy ranges .",
    "since we know the bat count rate in the bat ( 15150 kev ) range , we were able to use xspec to derive the model flux in the 0.3 - 10 kev band and then calculate a ratio between bat counts ( 15150 kev ) and flux ( 0.310 kev ) . for earlier epochs we derived the conversion ratio from the model fits to the bat data alone .",
    "we derived a similar ratio between xrt counts ( 0.310 kev ) and flux . with this extrapolation one",
    "can directly compare the early and later light curves and show ( figures  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] ) that the prompt emission smoothly transitions to the afterglow emission .",
    "the data from t@xmath52 + 1.17 hr to t@xmath52 + 8.25 hr were also fit with a power law with a photon index of 1.35@xmath30.21 and galactic absorption ( @xmath53=16.9 for 11 d.o.f . ) .",
    "the model flux over 0.310.0 kev was 1.8@xmath30.41 @xmath54 ergs @xmath25 s@xmath17 ( 3.54@xmath55 @xmath56 photons @xmath25 s@xmath17 ) . in this case there was no improvement to the fit by adding excess absorption .",
    "indeed , this later spectrum is not consistent with excess absorption at the level implied by the earlier wt data ; the excess absorption is limited at 90% confidence to @xmath57  @xmath25 .      the gamma - ray and x - ray decay light curve is shown in fig  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the light curve shows several prominent features which can be interpreted in light of the models discussed in @xcite ( hereafter z05 ) .",
    "first , as pointed out earlier there is a smooth transition from the prompt bat emission into the early x - ray emission and a fairly steep decay ( power law index @xmath58  in the discussion below ) until t@xmath59  s. this is followed by a possible superimposed x - ray flare , a phenomenon quite common in grbs as observed by swift @xcite . unfortunately observing constraints cut off observations in the middle of the possible flare , and",
    "the statistics do not allow for a meaningful fit to a flare component .",
    "observations resumed again at t@xmath7 + 4214  s , with a return to a power - law decay , with a shallower power law index ( @xmath60  below ) .    in order to fit the data to reasonable x - ray emission models ,",
    "two intervals were removed : bat data points before t@xmath7 + 50  s , which were believed to be part of the prompt emission , and xrt data points between t@xmath7 + 500 and the end of the first observation , so that the fit is not contaminated by the possible flare .",
    "two different fits were made and are discussed in turn .",
    "first , we tried a broken power law .",
    "this gave a power law index @xmath61  for the steep part of the light curve , a break time of @xmath62  s and an index @xmath63  for the shallow part ( @xmath64 for 111 d.o.f . ) .",
    "the steep part of the curve ( @xmath65 ) corresponds to region i in fig .  1 of z05 .",
    "according to z05 , if this time can be interpreted as the curvature effect @xcite , the index should be @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the _ energy _ index of the spectrum of the emission .",
    "taking @xmath67 = 0.62 , we should have @xmath58 = 2.62 , as compared to the observed value of 2.10 .",
    "one factor which could lead to a deviation from the @xmath66  relation is that the decay curve seen could be a superposition of two separate decay power laws , one steep due to the curvature component , and one shallow due to the forward shock component .",
    "so a fit was made to a superposition model : @xmath68 , where @xmath32  and @xmath69  are normalization factors .",
    "this fit gave a steep index @xmath70  and a shallow index @xmath71 ( @xmath72 for 110 d.o.f ) .",
    "statistically this fit is indistinguishable from the broken power law .",
    "however the physical interpretation is more straightforward .",
    "the steep index ( @xmath73 ) is the decay of the tail of the internal shock emission , which is superimposed on an underlying afterglow component with a decay index of @xmath74 .",
    "the afterglow component becomes dominant at t@xmath75  s.    it is instructive to compare the measured temporal index ( @xmath76 ) with the values predicted by the simple afterglow models compiled by @xcite . at late times ( t @xmath771.17 hr )",
    ", we should be in the slow cooling regime , and the spectral index of grb  050717 , @xmath78 , is consistent only with the regime where @xmath79 .",
    "here , following @xcite , @xmath80  is the spectral frequency of the emission , and @xmath81  and @xmath82 are the synchotron frequency and cooling frequency , respectively . using @xmath78 , we have the electron - acceleration power - law index @xmath83 . using the equations in table 1 of @xcite   and @xmath67 in the equations of @xcite to conform to the definition f@xmath84  used in this paper . ] and taking @xmath85 , we derive values for @xmath31 of @xmath86 , and @xmath87 for the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite and wind models @xcite , respectively .",
    "if @xmath88 @xcite , we derive @xmath31 values of @xmath89 , @xmath90 , again for the ism and wind models , respectively .",
    "we see that the late - time temporal index ( @xmath76 ) is inconsistent with the ism model and marginally consistent with the wind model .",
    "this analysis shows that at late times emission is dominated by the forward shock with a wind density profile .    in order for the afterglow of grb  050717 to have @xmath79",
    ", it must be observed at a time such that t @xmath6  t@xmath20 , where the critical time t@xmath20  is defined in z05 .",
    "this puts constraints on the wind parameter a@xmath91 , which is defined in @xcite as being proportional to the wind mass loss rate divided by the wind velocity ( units g cm@xmath17 ) .",
    "the parameter a@xmath91  must be in the range 0.010.001 , which is similar to the limit derived for grb  050128 @xcite .",
    "the late time shallow decay ( index @xmath93 ) continues until the flux becomes unobservable to the xrt .",
    "a lower limit is set for summed observations after t@xmath7 + 2.6  days .",
    "since there is no apparent break to a steeper decay in the light curve , the lower limit on a jet - break time is @xmath94  days .",
    "it is possible to derive an estimate of the spectral lag of the bat data between channel 2 ( 25 - 50 kev ) and channel 4 ( 100350 kev ) . from the spectral lag we can use the methodology of @xcite and @xcite to derive limits on the redshift of the grb and on the isotropic luminosity of the peak of the emission .",
    "the spectral lag was derived for the main peak of emission ( from t@xmath7 + 2.26  s to t@xmath7 + 5.8  s ) .",
    "the lag was found to be @xmath95  ms .",
    "hence the measured lag is statistically consistent with zero .",
    "the lag was also measured for several other intervals during the burst and with time rebinning ranging from 2  ms to 16  ms . in all cases ,",
    "the measured lag was small , positive and consistent with zero .",
    "such a low value for lag is quite unique for a long burst since @xcite has shown that the dynamic range of lags for long bursts spans @xmath96  ms to @xmath97  ms .",
    "in fact out of the 90 brightest bursts studied by @xcite , only 2% show a lag as small as that of grb 050717 .",
    "one can use the lag , the measured peak flux , and @xmath2 to set lower limits on the distance to the burst . using the peak flux of @xmath98 ergs @xmath25 s@xmath17 ( 15350  kev ; t@xmath7 + 2.752  s to t@xmath7 + 3.008  s ) , the parameters from the joint konus - bat fits to the main peak ( section  [ wind ] ) and the @xmath99 limit on the lag ( 8.3 ms ) , one derives a redshift of 2.7 and a peak luminosity of @xmath100 ergs s@xmath17 ( 15350 kev ) .",
    "the fit is relatively insensitive to variations in either peak flux or @xmath2 and other spectral fit parameters .",
    "since smaller values of spectral lag would lead to larger redshifts , this value , z = 2.7 , can be considered the @xmath101 lower limit on the redshift ; similarly the luminosity is also a lower limit .",
    "such a large redshift is consistent with the non - detection of an optical or infrared counterpart to the afterglow ( sections  [ other ] and [ optical ] ) and with the non - detection of a jet break ( section  [ after ] ) .",
    "a consistent interpretation of such a small lag is that the high energy emission from grb  050717 has been redshifted downward more than usual into the bat energy range .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the high energy component of burst emission shows narrower peaks and more variation than is seen at lower energies .",
    "shifting such spiky peaks into the bat range would cause the measured lag to be smaller than what would be observed in long bursts at lower redshifts .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that many short bursts seen by batse , swift , konus - wind , and hete-2 have extended emission starting a few seconds after the short spike and lasting for @xmath5tens of seconds . since short bursts are also known to have short lags @xcite , is it possible that grb  050717 is in fact a short burst or a magnetar flare from a nearby galaxy ?",
    "this burst has a pair of precursors of duration 128  ms and 320  ms , followed by @xmath102  s of extended emission along with a spectral lag consistent with short grbs .",
    "however , two properties of grb  050717 argue strongly against it being a short burst .",
    "first of all , the spectra of the precursors of this burst are significantly softer than the extended emission ( see fig  [ fig1 ] ) , while in all short bursts with extended emission the short spikes are significantly harder than the extended emission .",
    "secondly , in grb  050717 , the flux is dominated by the extended emission , while in short bursts , the flux is dominated by the short episode of emission .",
    "the ratio of peak to tail emission for a magnetar @xcite is even more extreme .",
    "therefore , it is more likely that grb  050717 is indeed a long burst seen at a large distance .    using a relationship derived by @xcite we can use the measured @xmath2 and the limits on luminosity and redshift to set a lower limit on the jet break time for this burst .",
    "after re - arranging equation  5 in @xcite :    @xmath103    [ eq2 ]    here @xmath104 is the jet break time in days in the observer frame , @xmath105 is the isotropic energy in units of @xmath106  ergs and @xmath107=2400  kev is the observed peak energy .",
    "errors on the exponents in the equation have been suppressed since the calculation is dominated by errors in the input parameters . with these values and z=2.7 , we can derive a lower limit on @xmath104 of 88 days . as we saw in section  [ after ]",
    "this is fully consistent with the observations .",
    "it was noted in section  [ wind ] that @xmath2  for grb  050717 is unusually high .",
    "the observed values are 2400  kev for the main peak and 2100  kev for the time integrated spectrum ; when propagated to a rest frame at @xmath108  = 2.7 , the intrinsic values of @xmath2  become 8900  kev and 7800  kev , respectively . these values can be compared to previously measured values of @xmath2  from the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) and bepposax .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) have performed a systematic spectral analysis of 350 bright grbs observed by batse .",
    "of these bursts , none show an integrated @xmath2  as large as what was measured for grb  050717 .",
    "the highest value calculated was 2039  kev for grb  971220 .",
    "@xcite provide time resolved spectroscopy for 156 bright batse bursts . in studying the catalog provided with the @xcite paper , we found only two bursts which had @xmath109  kev in multiple time resolved spectra .",
    "the moderately bright burst grb  940526b had @xmath109  kev in seven of the nine time resolved spectra , although @xcite report that the best fit @xmath2  for this burst is 1689  kev .",
    "one other batse burst , grb  960529 , had well constrained values of @xmath109  kev in a number of its time resolved spectra , and an unconstrained time - integrated value of @xmath109  kev .",
    "it is clear from figure  21 in @xcite that only a very small fraction of the 8459 time resolved spectra fit by @xcite have @xmath2  values as large as what is found for grb  050717 .",
    "it should be noted however , that the konus energy range extends farther than does batse ( @xmath110  mev ) , meaning that some bursts with extremely high values of @xmath2  may not be well constrained in the @xcite or @xcite fits . in addition none of the twelve bepposax bursts studied in @xcite",
    "have @xmath2  as high as what we report for grb  050717 .",
    "clearly grb  050717 is an exceptional case .",
    "it is instructive to ask if grb  050717 is unusual in other ways .",
    "we can compare for example the position of grb  050717 on a hardness - duration plot to other samples .",
    "using @xmath111 = 86  s and the fluence ratio s(100 - 300  kev)/s(50 - 100  kev ) = 3.67 , we can see that this burst does not have a particularly high hardness ratio and falls well within the scatter of long bursts in both the batse and bat samples ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "one can also use the redshift inferred from the spectral lag ( section  [ prompt ] ) , to see how grb  050717 fits the relationships that previous authors have derived between @xmath2  and isotropic energy @xcite and peak luminosity @xcite .",
    "the lower limits on the isotropic radiated energy , the isotropic peak luminosity , and peak energy in the source rest frame corresponding to the limit z @xmath6  2.7 are @xmath112  ergs ( 1 - 10,000 kev ) , @xmath113  erg  s@xmath17 ( 30 - 10,000  kev ) , and @xmath114  kev ( for a standard cosmology : @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117  km  s@xmath17  mpc@xmath17 ) .",
    "these values show that grb  050717 is an outlier on both the @xcite and @xcite relations in the direction of @xmath118  and @xmath119 being smaller than the relations would predict given @xmath120  kev .",
    "it is not possible to adjust the redshift ( within reasonable limits : @xmath121 ) to bring grb  050717 in line with either relation .",
    "thus we must conclude that grb  050717 does not fit either the @xcite or @xcite relations .",
    "we note that the maximum value of @xmath122  used in the derivation of either relation is @xmath123  kev , so these relations have not been verified for values of @xmath2  as large as that of grb  050717 .",
    "there have also been a number of recent papers @xcite which have presented strong evidence that the amati relation is not universal and that there are many batse grbs for which the relation is inconsistent .",
    "grb 050717 is an excellent example demonstating that the @xcite relation does not hold for all bursts , particularly those with high @xmath2 .",
    "maybe grb 050717 and similar bursts will eventually be able to tell us why the amati relationship is breaking down .",
    "as noted in sections  [ uvot ] and [ other ] , no optical counterpart to grb 050717 was found .",
    "the deepest limits were those obtained from prompt , at 21.7 ( r@xmath20 , t@xmath7 + 13.67  hr ) and 21.5 ( i@xmath20 , t@xmath7 + 16.02 hr ) .",
    "what conclusions can be drawn from the lack of an infrared counterpart ?",
    "first of all , is grb  050717 a dark burst ?",
    "@xcite make a comparison between the observed x - ray flux and the r - band magnitude of the afterglow at ten hours after the trigger for a large set of bursts and define a dark burst as a burst lying in a certain region of the log(f@xmath124)-log(f@xmath125 ) diagram . for grb  050717 ,",
    "the x - ray flux interpolated to t@xmath7 + 10  hr is 0.015 @xmath9jy ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) and the r - band limit extrapolated to t@xmath7 + 10  hr would be r@xmath12621.5 .",
    "this is solidly within the bright burst region of the @xcite diagram ; thus it is not possible to say that this is a dark burst given how late the optical limits are .    similarly the lack of a counterpart can not be used as confirmation of the high redshift . assuming @xmath127 , the lyman edge would be redshifted to 91.2  nm(@xmath128 ) = 337  nm .",
    "this is consistent with the relatively shallow ultraviolet limits set by uvot , but the counterpart could still easily be observed in the i band .",
    "it is instructive to compare the infrared observations of grb  050717 to those of grb  050904 , a high redshift ( @xmath129 ) burst for which an infrared counterpart was found .",
    "however , the ir observations of grb  050904 were either much earlier ( j@xmath130 , t@xmath131  hr ) @xcite or much deeper ( i@xmath132 , t@xmath133  hr ) @xcite than those obtained for grb  050717 .",
    "the lack of an observed counterpart to grb  050717 must be attributed to the lateness of the observations .",
    "the long gamma - ray burst grb  050717 shows a number of interesting features which can be interpreted in light of the predominant models of bursts and their afterglows .",
    "it has been known for many years that spectral evolution operates in long gamma - ray bursts in several ways . @xcite",
    "first recognized that the more intense portions of bursts are spectrally harder than the less intense time periods .",
    "concomitantly , individual burst pulses are asymmetric , especially at low energies .",
    "this was pointed out by @xcite and later @xcite and @xcite showed via spectral lag analysis that , if the burst was bright enough , positive lags were manifest , averaged over the whole time profile .",
    "similarly , and related to the first two effects , the burst `` envelope '' ( containing the peaks and valleys in a burst ) tends to soften with time in the vast majority of bursts , an effect that was quantified by @xcite .",
    "@xcite tied these effects together by demonstrating conclusively that on all time scales , gamma - ray bursts are time - asymmetric . thus the later",
    ", usually lower intensity portions of a burst should also be spectrally softer .",
    "the long gamma - ray burst grb  050717 shows all aspects of these evolutionary trends including overall hard to soft spectral evolution as the prompt emission decays and time asymmetries in all peaks at all energies .",
    "features include two short , soft precursor spikes and at least seven peaks in the main burst .    the main emission of the burst clearly exhibits hard to soft spectral evolution as discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the light curve of the prompt emission ( fig  [ fig1 ] ) begins with two short , faint , spectrally soft spikes , followed by an intense peak which is the hardest portion of the burst .",
    "the burst intensity envelope as seen above 15 kev decays over the next @xmath134  seconds until it becomes detectable only at lower energies .",
    "superimposed on the overall decay are at least four subsidiary peaks , each of which is less intense and softer than the one before .",
    "however the spectra of the peaks are harder than the intervening valleys .",
    "furthermore , as seen in figs  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2a ] , each peak is time - asymmetric at all energies .",
    "thus the time profile of this burst is a very good example of the overall time asymmetry described by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also showed that the structure of pulses in grbs is narrower at high energies .",
    "this is another aspect of what @xcite has called the `` pulse paradigm , '' and is physically related to the overall spectral evolution of pulses .",
    "grb 050717 was unusual in that its spectral lag is very short ( positive but statistically consistent with zero  see section  [ prompt ] ) , while nearly all long bursts clearly show a large positive spectral lag @xcite .",
    "the short lag and observed brightness of the burst suggest that it is at a high redshift ( @xmath135 ) and hence has a large intrinsic luminosity ( @xmath136 erg s@xmath17 ) .",
    "the features observed in the burst are likely representative of spiky high energy features red - shifted to the bat energy range .",
    "the late decay of grb 050717 is consistent with a steep decay from the tail of the internal shock emission superimposed on a less steep underlying afterglow component . at later times",
    "after the fireball has decayed , the emission is dominated by the forward shock component with an inferred x - ray flare , followed by a shallow decay .",
    "grb 050717 also demonstrates many of the features of the unified picture of the late time evolution of grb emission @xcite .",
    "when the bat flux is extrapolated to the 0.310 kev energy range it is seen that the prompt emission smoothly transitions into the slowly decaying phase . during the early x - ray emission of grb 050717 , the decay index is somewhat less steep than would be expected if it were due solely to the tail emission of the prompt grb . as discussed in section  [ after",
    "] , this can be interpreted as a superposition of tail and external shock emission , although other interpretations are also discussed . before data collection was cut off by an orbital constraint at @xmath5  800 s after the trigger , the light curve shows evidence of the start of an x - ray flare , when observations take up again , the flux is much weaker and the decay index is shallow , since at this time the afterglow is dominated by the forward shock .",
    "the flux became too faint to observe before the expected jet break at @xmath137 days .",
    "the short spectral lag and high @xmath2  are very unusual for long grbs , putting grb  050717 within the bottom 2% of long bursts for spectral lag , and within the highest few bursts detected in terms of peak energy .",
    "other burst and afterglow properties are common and easily interpreted .",
    "this is an indication that these properties also hold for bright , high redshift bursts .",
