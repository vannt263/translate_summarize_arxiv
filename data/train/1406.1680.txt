    "the origin of the anomalous diffusion on fractal substrates has been well understood several decades ago ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref.@xcite ) . however , in the last years , it has been repeatedly reported that , on certain kind of self - similar objects , the anomalous diffusion is modulated by logarithmic - periodic oscillations ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref.@xcite ) . in all these cases ,",
    "the time behavior of a single random walk ( rw ) or a set of noninteracting rws were studied .",
    "the origin of the anomalous diffusion ( with or without oscillations ) can be found in the self - similar character of the substrate where the particles move .",
    "it is also well known that the anomalous diffusion can also appear in a simple one - dimensional lattice if hard - core interaction between particles is considered , i.e. , two particles can not occupy the same lattice site , and a particle can not cross over another one ( the so called single - file diffusion ) .",
    "more specifically , the mean - square displacement ( msd ) of a tagged particle behaves as @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 ) after a crossover time , which depends on the concentration of particles ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . note that , despite hard - core interactions , the center of mass of the system presents a normal behavior .",
    "this model , and similar ones , are useful to describe several microscopic processes in physics , chemistry and biology ( see , _",

    "the aim of the present work is to study the single - file diffusion problem on the one - dimensional lattice with a self - similar distribution of hopping rates introduced in ref .",
