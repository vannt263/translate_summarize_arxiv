    "the kuiper belt has been shaped by accretion and disruption processes throughout the history of the solar system . with small orbital eccentricities ,",
    "the relative velocities of the objects in the early kuiper belt were sufficiently low to allow accretion processes to form kilometer and much larger objects .",
    "later , the velocity dispersion increased , possibly as the kbo population was stirred up by the gravitational effects of the larger planets and planetoids . only large objects were then able to continue growing through impacts , whereas collisions among smaller bodies resulted in disruption .",
    "the details of these processes depend on the internal strength of the kbos and on the orbital and dynamical evolution of the gas giant planets .",
    "the size distribution of kbos , therefore , contains information on the internal structure and composition of the kbos  and hence information on the location and epoch in which they formed  and on planetary migration (",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "direct observations have detected kbos as faint as magnitude @xmath1 @xcite , which corresponds to a diameter of about 27  km assuming a 4% albedo .",
    "the large end side of the kbo size distribution can therefore be characterized through its brightness distribution .",
    "the latter is well described by a power law @xmath2 , with an index @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xcite @xcite ) for objects brighter than about @xmath5 , or @xmath6 .",

    "evidence surfaced that a break in the power law occurs at a diameter larger than @xmath7 : @xcite conducted deep hubble space telescope observations with the advanced camera for surveys which led to the discovery of only 3 new objects fainter than r  =  26 , about 4% of the number expected from a single power law distribution extrapolated to @xmath8 . while this work remains the state of the art for deep direct surveys of the outer solar system ,",
    "recent campaigns have observed many more faint objects down to magnitude @xmath9 , which with the assumption of a @xmath10 albedo corresponds to about @xmath11 in diameter ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "these recent data allowed them to locate a break in the power law size distribution at diameters @xmath12 .",
    "the region of the size spectrum between tens of kilometers and meters in diameter is particularly interesting as models predict here the occurrence of transitions between different regimes where the binding energy of kbos is dominated either by gravity or internal strength .",
    "these transitions would leave a signature in the size distribution ( @xcite , @xcite , , and references therein ) .",
    "occultation surveys allow us to reach farther then the current limits of direct observations , and into this region of interest .",
    "these surveys monitor background stars in order to detect the chance alignment of a kbo with a target star , which would generate a variation in the observed flux of the star . at distances in the outer solar system ( tens to thousands of au )",
    "the signature left in a lightcurve by the transits of @xmath13 objects is dominated by diffraction .",
    "this technique requires high frequency photometric time series as the time scale for an occultation by an outer solar system object is a fraction of a second ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "the details of this dataset , and of the dataset published in z08 , are summarized in table  [ tab : dataset ] . over 90% of our data",
    "is collected within @xmath29 of the ecliptic plane in order to maximize the rate of occultations .",
    "taos uses the _ zipper  mode _",
    "technique to read out the ccd cameras at high frequency .",
    "this method , described in @xcite , enables high speed observations across the 3@xmath30 field of view of the taos telescopes , but it artificially increases the crowding of the field and the background . in zipper",

    "note that the images of different stars in a rowblock , however , do not necessarily belong to the same epoch .",
    "the zipper  mode readout boosts the sky background by a factor of 27 at a 5  hz readout rate .",
    "this limits the sensitivity of taos to stars as faint as @xmath31 , for which a signal  to  noise ratio ( snr ) of @xmath32 can be achieved in a dark night .",
    "the magnitude and snr distributions for the target stars in our survey are shown in figure  [ fig : r_snr ] .",
    "on the left panel , the @xmath33axis is the taos instrumental magnitude @xmath34 , which is defined by a regression on the usno - b magnitudes to be similar to @xmath35 .",
    "the correlation between instrumental magnitude and snr is shown in figure  [ fig : rvssnr ] .",
    "the scatter in the relationship between snr and @xmath34 is due to both changes in the sky background and in the weather conditions , and to different degrees of crowding in the fields . in figure",

    "hours at different angles from opposition .",
    "the top scale indicates the velocity of a kbo at the center of a field at this elongation .",
    "we cover a large range of opposition angles ; our field selection algorithm favors ecliptic fields near zenith .",
    "most angles are positive because the weather at the site tends to improve after midnight .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : oppang ] shows the distribution of ecliptic latitude of our data .",
    "the effects of the angle from opposition on our efficiency and event rate , as well as the efficiency as a function of magnitude and crowding are discussed further in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "the first step in the analysis is the photometric reduction of the zipper mode images in the data set .",
    "a custom aperture photometry package  @xcite is used to measure the brightness of each star at each epoch , and the resulting series of flux measurements are then assembled into lightcurves for subsequent analysis , which is described in the following subsections . in section  [ sec : fp ] we describe our detection algorithm and the rejection of false positives .",
    "we then describe the efficiency tests : in section  [ sec : angs ] we describe in detail how we identify the angular size of our target stars to simulate occultations correctly . in section  [ sec : analysis ] we show how we simulate and implant occultation events in our lightcurves , and test the behavior of our efficiency as a function of various parameters relative to the occultations and to the observing strategy . finally , we can derive the effective coverage of our survey ( section  [ sec : omega ] ) .      the _ fresnel scale _",
    "is defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the wavelength of observation , and @xmath38 the distance to the occulter  @xcite . for optical observations at the distance of the kuiper belt ( about 43  au ) the fresnel scale is @xmath39 .",
    "occultation events will therefore exhibit significant diffraction effects .",
    "occultations are manifested in the lightcurve of an observed star as an alternation of bright and dark features , typically with an overall suppression of the flux .",
    "theoretical occultation lightcurves are shown in figure  [ fig : sim ] .",
    "the signature of an occultation by a kbo of sub - kilometer size has a duration of about 0.2 second at opposition , and about a second near quadrature .",
    "a typical kbo occultation is then expected to result in the suppression of the flux for one or a few consecutive points in a taos lightcurve . in order to ascertain",
    "the extra - terrestrial origin of a dip in a lightcurve taos observes simultaneously with multiple telescopes .",
    "this allows us to rule out , on the basis of simple parallax considerations , atmospheric scintillation phenomena which might mimic an occultation event and which could be a source of false positives in occultation surveys , as well as any non - atmospheric phenomena such as birds , airplanes , etc .    in order to detect occultations",
    "we need to identify brief flux changes in a star simultaneously observed by all telescopes .",
    "the statistical significance of a simultaneous low point in our lightcurves can be assessed rigorously , and the probability of a low measurement being drawn out of pure noise decreases with the number of telescopes observing the target , provided that the measurements for the telescopes are independent .",
    "the lightcurves are high - pass filtered to remove trends due to weather patterns and changes in atmospheric transparency .",
    "high - pass filtering the lightcurves preserves the information on time - scales relevant to occultation phenomena ( one or a few points in a time series ) .",
    "the implementation of the filter is described in z08 .",
    "the filter produces a time series in which @xmath40 , the measurement taken at time @xmath41 , represents the deviation from the local mean of the lightcurve in units of local standard deviation .            to detect events we rank  order the photometric measurement in each of our lightcurves , from the lowest to the highest flux , independently for each telescope ( labeled a , b and d ) . the @xmath42-th point in a lightcurve",
    "will be associated to rank @xmath43 for telescope  t. we then consider the rank triplets ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the probability distribution of the quantity @xmath45 , with @xmath46 the number of points in the lightcurve set , can be determined combinatorially . knowing this , under the null hypothesis that there is no event in the triplet @xmath42 , we can compute the probability for a random variable @xmath47 arising from this distribution @xmath48 .",
    "we set a threshold such that we expect fewer than 0.27 events in our dataset that are due to random fluctuations .",
    "for the dataset discussed in this paper we accept as events all data points that produce a rank product less likely than @xmath49 to be drawn from a random distribution .",
    "note that events generated by large kbos , or for observations near quadrature , would affect more than one point in the lightcurve ( figure  [ fig : sim ] ) , and our rank  based search algorithm is most efficient when the dip in the lightcurve is isolated .",
    "therefore , in addition to searching for single  point events , we also bin our lightcurves by 2 , re - rank them and repeat the statistical tests described above .",
    "the probability of each data point is assessed for both unbinned and binned lightcurves .",
    "each lightcurve is binned twice , with two different starting points .",
    "this increases the detectability of occultations by large kbos and by kbos transiting with low relative velocity . for a detailed discussion of our statistical analysis see @xcite .    for a set of lightcurves of a given star",
    ", the ranks in the three telescopes should not be correlated for the statistical analysis described above to be valid .",
    "we have developed a series of statistical tests to identify data runs where significant correlations ( typically due to fast moving cirrus clouds ) are found in the lightcurves . in such data",
    "runs the ranks are not independently distributed and thus we can not accurately determine the statistical significance of any candidate events .",
    "any data run where the independence of the measurements after filtering can not be rigorously established is removed from our dataset .",
    "a complete description of these tests is beyond the scope of this paper , but they are discussed in detail in @xcite                for the next step we relax considerably the ultimate significance requirement described above , and select as _ provisional candidates _ those triplets that have @xmath50 . note that the significance @xmath51 refers to the probability that the point would be drawn from a random distribution , therefore the lower the value of @xmath51 the higher the statistical significance of the event .",
    "nearly 150,000 provisional candidates are found .",
    "we use all these measurements to identify and remove spurious regions of the lightcurves , and hence identify and reject false positive events which arise from sources other than random chance .",
    "the constraints described below allows us to recognize regions of lightcurves with atypical noise and contamination by transiting objects ( satellites or meteors , which turn out to be the major source of false alarms ) , and to identify high - frequency fluctuations in the raw data that are not removed by the high - pass filter .",
    "these are the steps of our false positive rejection process :    * _ contiguity : _ contiguous candidates within a lightcurve and candidates that are within three time - stamps of each other are removed . only the one rank triplet that has the highest significance in a series of contiguous or proximate points",
    "is considered as a candidate .",
    "this removes double  counted events : events caused by large kbos or kbos moving at low relative velocity would affect more than one contiguous point .",
    "furthermore this removes events that are double  counted because they appear significant in both the binned and unbinned lightcurves .",
    "this eliminates about 40% of the candidates . *",
    "_ simultaneity : _ candidates that appear in the lightcurves of more than one star simultaneously at the same time - stamp _ or _ within three rowblocks are considered to be false positives .",
    "we expect simultaneous count drops in time - domain to be primarily due to inaccurate aperture positioning in the photometry . in the rowblock domain simultaneous count drops might be due to inaccurate background determination or non - occultation events altering the baseline of the lightcurve at , or around , the candidate event , or by fast moving cirrus clouds or other phenomena which induce high frequency fluctuations in multiple lightcurves which are not removed by the high - pass filter .",
    "this cut removes about 60% of the remaining candidates . * _ number of telescopes : _ at this point we require all of our remaining candidates to have been observed by all three telescopes .",
    "although we are only considering three - telescope runs in our analysis , for some targets the lightcurve might not be extracted in the photometry phase for all telescopes .",
    "small differences in the field of view and in the field distortion might make one star target not visible to all telescopes if it is at the edge of the field or if the crowding induced by the zipper  mode readout caused overlap of the target with other stars  @xcite .",
    "about 35% of the remaining candidates are thus removed .",
    "note that this cut can not be applied earlier as simultaneous events might appear in only one 3telescope lightcurve , but also in 2telescope lightcurves , and we want to be able to recognize and remove these events . at this point",
    "there are still over 20,000 candidates left .",
    "note that we do not count the star hours discarded by this cut in our total exposure of @xmath52 star  hours . *",
    "_ significance threshold : _ we finally constrain @xmath51 such as to expect fewer than 0.27 false positives in our dataset .",
    "this constraint depends on the size of the dataset : for the @xmath53 triplets remaining @xmath54 allows @xmath55 false positives due to random noise .",
    "only 228 candidates remain .",
    "the remaining candidates require visual inspection : first of the lightcurves , and for any remaining candidates , of the images .",
    "most of the events are caused by the passing of bright objects , such as artificial satellites , meteorites or asteroids , that generate a variation in the background or baseline of the lightcurve responsible for causing artificially low counts in the neighborhood of the object .",
    "many , but not all , of these false positives are removed by the simultaneity cut described above .",
    "note that in our observing mode bright stars generate a bright streak across the length of our images ( see  @xcite ) , as flux is collected during the shutterless row shifting .",
    "in the presence of a bright object overlapping with a star  streak generated by the zipper  mode readout , the brightness of the streak is overestimated , thus too much flux is subtracted from the rowblock column causing an artificial flux drop in the star time series . in many instances",
    "the foreground object will also appear inside the star aperture artificially boosting its brightness .",
    "this flux drop will then be associated with a very high flux measurement following or preceding the event epoch , a signature that allows us to remove these false positives by inspecting the lightcurve .",
    "we also inspect the centroid position of the aperture .",
    "if the aperture position has moved significantly at the time - stamp of the candidate the candidate is rejected . of the remaining candidates ,",
    "90% are rejected by visual inspection of the time series .",
    "finally we inspect the _ images _ of the remaining 23 candidates : they also were all associated with bright moving objects overlapping star streaks .",
    "no candidate events were left in our dataset at the conclusion of this process .",
    "the shape of a lightcurve during an occultation event , and hence the detection efficiency , is strongly dependent on the angular size of the target star ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our fields contain a variety of stellar types and a large range of angular sizes ( figure  [ fig : angsz]a ) .",
    "here we describe the method we use to estimate the angular sizes of our target stars in order to account for this effect when estimating our detection efficiencies ( see section [ sec : analysis ] ) .",
    "angular sizes have been related to the position of a star in the color - color or color - magnitude diagrams ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we follow the work of @xcite and calculate the angular size of our star targets using the 2mass @xmath56 and @xmath57 color  @xcite to invert the set of equations : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the surface brightness of a star in k - band , which is related to its @xmath60 color , as well as to its unreddened apparent k magnitude and angular size @xmath61 . the relationship between the surface brightness and the color of a star ( equation  [ eq : sb ] ) is calibrated using angular sizes measured directly by long baseline interferometry  @xcite .",
    "not all of our target stars , however , are identified 2mass objects , while in the photometry phase we have identified all of our targets with usno - b objects .",
    "we therefore devised a method that relies on usno - b @xmath62 and @xmath63 magnitude to calculate the angular sizes of our targets .",
    "we first derive the angular size of a subset of targets identified with 2mass objects using the above equations , and scale it to obtain the angular size the targets would have if their apparent magnitude were @xmath64 .",
    "we then considered the usno - b @xmath65 color for all of these targets and calculated a regression on these points .",
    "this generates a formula that allows us to go from the usno - b color of any of our targets to 2mass colors and thus predict angular sizes according to equations  [ eq : sb ]  &  [ eq : angsoumen ] , for an apparent magnitude @xmath66 . to calculate the true angular size we rescale from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "the angular sizes of a subset of taos targets , rescaled to @xmath66 , is plotted as derived from equation  [ eq : sb ]  &  [ eq : angsoumen ] versus the usno - b @xmath65 color ( figure  [ fig : angsz]b ) .",
    "our regression on the data is plotted as well ( solid line ) .",
    "the scatter in the determination of the angular size via the method described above is large , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : angsz]b .",
    "this is due to scatter in the usno - b color ( @xmath68 ,  @xcite ) , to the ( much smaller ) scatter in the @xmath56 and @xmath57 magnitudes , and to the scatter in the empirical determination of the relationship between @xmath61 and @xmath60 in equation  [ eq : sb ]  &  [ eq : angsoumen ] .",
    "we have not used any interstellar reddening corrections , and the angular size estimation of an unknown reddened star from the near - ir relationship would be relatively less affected compared to that in visual bands .",
    "reddening is typically small for our targets though , since we are only considering objects brighter than @xmath69 .",
    "the distribution of angular sizes is well reproduced .",
    "figure  [ fig : angsz]a shows the distribution of angular sizes for a typical taos field , calculated via equations  [ eq : sb ]  &  [ eq : angsoumen ] , and figure  [ fig : angsz]c shows the distribution of angular sizes in our efficiency simulation obtained via the usno - b color .",
    "the distributions do overlap .",
    "about 2% of our simulated angular sizes fall in the region @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where there are no observed objects .",
    "these objects have poor usno - b color determination .",
    "figure  [ fig : angsz]d shows the region of the @xmath72 space where simulated events _",
    "are recovered_. there are few recoveries in the region @xmath70 and @xmath71 , so these stars do not contribute the the expected event rate .",
    "it is necessary to assess the efficiency of our recovery algorithm in order to derive the number density of kbos from the number of events in our survey . in order to measure our recovery efficiency",
    "we implant our data with synthetic occultations .",
    "the data are then reprocessed in the same way we did to search for true events . by implanting into the actual lightcurves",
    "we do not make any assumption regarding the nature of the noise in our data .",

    "to kbos smaller than @xmath216 occultation surveys provide the only probe of this region of the size spectrum , and the large taos dataset allowed us to set the first constraints to the location of the second break .",
    "we also considered the jupiter family comets . assuming the jfcs are injected into their present orbit from one of the kuiper belt populations , classical belt , plutinos , or from the scattered disk , we compared the upper limit derived from our survey to the estimates of the number of objects derived using the number of jfcs by @xcite for a population of cometary precursors entirely in the cb , that of @xcite for plutinos and of  @xcite for a progenitor population in the sd .",
    "we can rule out the a unique precursor family composed of cb objects @xmath213 .",
    "this preliminary result confirms that occultation surveys can help understanding the origin of jfcs .",
    "a recent analysis of the hst guiding data ( s09 ) reports the detection of an occultation by a @xmath17 kbo .",
    "this object is detected at high ecliptic latiutde ( @xmath217 ) .",
    "the surface density derived in s09 , assuming a straight power law size distribution for small kbos , is within the upper limit set by taos , although a @xmath106 increment over the best fit surface density is ruled out to better than 95% c.l .",
    "taos has operated for over four years observing continuously with three , and now four , 50  cm aperture telescopes .",
    "taos is only marginally sensitive to sub - km kbo occultations , but we were able to prove that the low sensitivity at sub - km sizes is more than compensated for by the vast exposure of which taos is capable .",
    "improvements in our selection criteria and the analysis of four telescope data should increase our sensitivity to smaller objects .",
