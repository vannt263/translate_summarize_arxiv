    "symmetry reduced models of general relativity have been extensively studied and applied in the framework of cosmology . in cosmological models",
    "the infinite degrees of freedom of the full theory are reduced to a finite number describing the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "current observations seem to be best described by ( spatially flat ) homogeneous and isotropic friedman - robertson - walker space - times .",
    "for that reason , the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy is by now an accepted basic ingredient in the so - called _ standard model _ of cosmology .    under quite general conditions ,",
    "general relativity predicts the development of space - time singularities .",
    "one prime example of such singular behavior is the presence of the initial big - bang singularity in cosmological models .",
    "energy densities as well as space time curvature diverge approaching the initial big - bang singularity , and any description based on classical space time notions becomes inapplicable .",
    "general relativity is no longer valid and has to be replaced by a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "although no complete quantum theory of gravity is yet available , loop quantum gravity appears as an promising candidate@xcite .",
    "loop quantum gravity is a background independent non perturbative approach to the quantization of general relativity .",
    "the main prediction of the theory is the discreteness of geometry at the fundamental level : operators corresponding to geometric quantities such as the area and volume have discrete spectra @xcite .",
    "geometry is quantized and at small scales the smooth notion of space and time simply can no longer be applied .",
    "one of the main clear - cut applications of the theory , where the discovery of discreteness plays an important role , is the description of the fundamental degrees of freedom of black hole ( isolated ) horizons@xcite . these fundamental excitations give rise to the correct value of black hole entropy that is expected from semi - classical considerations .",
    "the application of loop quantum gravity to cosmological models is known as loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite ( see also @xcite for an alternative approach ) .",
    "the simplification arising from the symmetry reduction makes it possible to address physical questions that still remain open in the full theory .",
    "for instance lqc provides a novel paradigm for the understanding of the fate of the big - bang singularity in quantum gravity . the important physical question of whether classical singularities of general relativity are not present in the quantum theory is answered in the affirmative in lqc@xcite .",
    "the basic mechanisms leading to this striking result can be traced back to the fundamental discreteness of geometric operators which drastically changes the quantum evolution equation in the deep planckian regime .",
    "in addition , consistency conditions , known as the dynamical initial condition , seem to severely restrict the freedom in the choice of ` initial ' values for the evolution and it is argued that these conditions may single out a unique wave function of the universe@xcite . it has also been shown that loop quantum cosmology leads to modifications of the classical friedman equation .",
    "recent work has shown that these effects can provide the proper initial conditions for chaotic inflation and may lead to measurable effects on the cmb @xcite .    in spite of these successes ,",
    "a complete characterization of the physical hilbert space of loop quantum cosmology remains an open issue .",
    "the definition of the physical inner product is the missing piece of the puzzle in lqc . without the physical inner product ,",
    "there is no notion of a probability measure which is an essential ingredient for physical prediction in the quantum theory .",
    "any interpretation of the wave function as a probability amplitude is futile without the probability measure provided by the physical inner product .",
    "in addition the physical inner product provides a means for eliminating pathological solutions to the constraints .",
    "for instance it can be shown that the space of solutions of lqc is generally non separable , i.e. , an uncountable infinity of solutions to the quantum constraint equation exist .",
    "such a huge physical hilbert space is certainly not expected for a system with finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "some of these solutions exhibit peculiar properties such as wild oscillatory or diverging behavior in the regime where one would expect agreement with standard wheeler - dewitt quantum cosmology . in the absence of the physical inner product , so far spurious solutions are eliminated using the dynamical initial condition coupled with heuristic arguments based on semi - classicality requirements .",
    "although these requirements are physically motivated , unphysical solutions can be easily identified if a notion of physical inner product is provided .",
    "more precisely , on the basis of the notion of physical probability physical states are defined by equivalence classes of solutions up to zero norm states .",
    "it is hoped that the ill - behaved solutions mentioned above will be factored out by this means once a suitable notion of physical inner product is provided .",
    "there exists a simple method known as group averaging to provide a definition of the physical inner product in generally covariant systems when the constraints generate a group action @xcite . in this paper",
    "we review and use the technique called _ refined algebraic quantization _ @xcite as a recipe to construct the physical hilbert space .",
    "the physical inner product is constructed in a simple manner if one can define a unitary operator generating ` translations ' along the gauge orbits generated by the quantum constraints in a suitable kinematical hilbert space .",
    "this technique can not be applied to the standard formulations of loop quantum cosmology because the quantum hamiltonian constraint is not a self adjoint operator ( in the kinematical hilbert space ) and thus it does not lead to any well defined unitary ` evolution ' when exponentiated .    in this paper",
    "we present a model of loop quantum gravity that arises from a symmetry reduction of the self dual plebanski action . in this formulation",
    "the symmetry reduction leads to a very simple hamiltonian constraint that can be quantized explicitly in the framework of loop quantum cosmology .",
    "the model is defined in the riemannian sector which constitutes a limitation when considering physical predictions .",
    "however , we will present a method for transforming to the lorentzian sector and then argue that the main results of the model are manifested in the lorentzian sector .",
    "the model shares the same kinematical hilbert space with standard loop quantum cosmology , but differs in that the resulting hamiltonian constraint is self - adjoint and thus the group averaging technique can be used to construct the physical inner product . when matter is incorporated in the form of a cosmological constant",
    ", we can solve the model exactly both for the physical wave functions and the physical inner product .",
    "the physical inner product reduces the infinite set of solutions of the quantum hamiltonian constraint equation to one physically normalizable solution .",
    "this constitutes an interesting example where the very large ( non separable ) kinematical hilbert space is reduced to a ( trivially ) separable physical hilbert space .",
    "we end with a discussion of the relevance of the model to standard lqc .",
    "we show that despite the simpler constraint the model shares the same qualitative features of standard lqc with one important difference .",
    "we will then discuss the implications that can be derived about lqc in general .",
    "our starting point is the classical self dual riemannian gravitational action which , as noted by plebanski@xcite , can be written as a constrained su(2 ) bf theory @xmath0 = \\int   \\sigma_i \\wedge f^i(a )   -      \\psi_{ij } \\left [ \\sigma^i \\wedge \\sigma^j -          \\frac{1}{3 } \\delta^{ij } \\sigma^k \\wedge \\sigma_k \\right ]      + \\lambda \\ ,",

    "we wish to quantize the symmetry reduced theory in the same manner as loop quantum cosmology by using techniques from the full theory adapted to the symmetry .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian constraint is represented as an operator on a kinematical hilbert space using holonomies and fluxes as the basic variables .",

    "we start with the formal definitions and notation . the discussion will not serve as a general review of the method , but will instead be tailored to the single constraint system at hand .    the idea of refined algebraic quantization is to build the physical hilbert space @xmath52 starting from a kinematical hilbert space @xmath53 acquired by quantizing the theory first ignoring the constraint .",
    "the constraint is represented as a self - adjoint operator on this kinematical hilbert space . as in standard dirac quantization ,",
    "the physical states are annihilated by the constraint operator .",

    "the physical inner product between two states @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 where the l.h.s is just notation , and due to the anti - linearity of @xmath65 the order has been reversed on the r.h.s .. a unique physical state is labeled by an equivalence class of states in @xmath54 .",

    "we will indicate why this occurs and the interpretation for the lorentzian regime .",
    "furthermore , we can see that the classical singularity ( @xmath197 ) does not present a barrier to the evolution as the wave function can be evolved through it .",
    "the simplicity of the hamiltonian constraint used here has allowed for explicit calculations to be performed . a rigorous definition of the physical scalar product was given and used to factor out spurious solutions to the constraint equations with zero physical norm .",

    "using this simple relation we can compare the two hamiltonian constraints and the physical implications of the differences .",
    "in addition , we will discuss the cosmological predictions of such a model .",
    "a lorentzian model can be constructed if one uses general properties of the isotropic reduction of general relativity . with homogeneity and",
    "isotropy the curvature part of the hamiltonian constraint changes sign while the cosmological constant remains the same when going from the riemannian sector to the lorentzian one .",

    "equivalently the same effect is obtained by changing the sign of the triad @xmath28 ( which amounts to sending @xmath96 to @xmath200 in the solutions presented here ) .",

    "the difference equation for standard loop quantum cosmology is given by @xmath205 where the volume eigenvalues are @xmath206 , and @xmath207 stands for the sign function .",
    "that the two constraints are asymptotically the same can be shown by using the large volume expansion for the volume difference coefficients @xmath208 . plugging this approximation into ( [ diff_lqc ] )",

    "the two models would thus share the same large volume semi - classical limit .",

    "the constraint of standard loop quantum cosmology is @xmath209 whereas the constraint used here would be @xmath210 it is readily seen that for positive values of the triad the two constraints are proportional to each other and thus are classically equivalent on the constraint surface where @xmath211 .",
    "the main qualitative difference between the two constraints is that they are not equivalent for negative orientations of the triad .",
    "this is indicated in the difference equation by the presence of the @xmath212 term on the right hand side of equation ( [ diff_lqc ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath212 is put in by hand in standard lqc such that the constraint is classically symmetric for both orientations of the triad .",

    "we have shown that the action ( [ full_bf_action ] ) does not lead to the @xmath212 term . in the next subsection",
    "we discuss in more detail the implications of such a change .",
    "the other crucial difference between the constraints is that our constraint is self - adjoint .",
    "this allows us to carry out the group averaging technique to construct the physical inner product .",
    "the constraint of standard loop quantum cosmology is not , although self - adjoint constraints have been proposed @xcite .",
    "we have stated the main qualitative difference between the simpler model lies in the classical extension to negative orientations of the triad .",
    "this ambiguity , which is manifested by the presence of the @xmath212 term in the difference equation ( [ diff_lqc ] ) , has important consequences in the quantum theory .",
    "we now show that absence of the @xmath212 term  forced on us by the action ( [ full_bf_action ] )  leads to many attractive features in the quantum theory .",
    "the physical wave function solutions of the two difference equations are shown in figure [ l_small ] . for large positive values of the triad ( positive @xmath96 )",
    "the solutions behave the same .",
    "however , for negative @xmath96 the solutions are entirely different owing to the @xmath212 term . because of that term , the solution in figure [ l_smallb ] is symmetric and thus both orientations of the triad have the same semi - classical limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the solution of the simplified constraint clearly does not have the right semi - classical limit for negative orientations of the triad .",
    "at first one might think that this is undesirable in the quantum theory since a large portion of the quantum configuration space does not have the right semi - classical limit .",
    "however , we see that the solution for negative triad is rapidly suppressed indicating a classically forbidden region .",
    "thus , the universe would have very low probability for being in the region and would instead more likely be found in the semi - classical regime of positive @xmath96 .",
    "notice that because @xmath81 , the standard notion of probability amplitude can be associated to the physical wave function for the single partial observable @xmath28 .",
    "physically the cosmological constant term in ( [ hclass ] ) changes its sign when @xmath28 goes to @xmath213 .",
    "the regions @xmath214 and @xmath215 correspond to an effective positive and negative cosmological constant respectively .",
    "it is precisely because of the absence of the @xmath212 term that the model can be solved exactly .",
    "if we were to use a constraint with the @xmath212 term the path integral would not be solvable explicitly and it can be shown that there do not exist any kinematically normalizable solutions .",
    "the fact that the physical solution is kinematically normalizable simplified the construction of @xmath52 . without kinematically normalizable solutions the path integral needs to be solved in order to construct the physical inner product .",
    "the normalizability of the solutions can be better understand by looking at the large volume behavior of the solutions .",
    "as in the riemannian model the general solution of the simplified model is @xmath216 the bessel y solutions all diverge for negative @xmath96 and the bessel j solutions all diverge for positive @xmath96 except for the one sector where the bessel function order is an integer as it was in the riemannian solution ( [ normedsol ] ) .",
    "the bessel j solutions are plotted for large @xmath96 in figure [ normalizability ] .",
    "it is clear that only in the special sector @xmath217 does the solution not diverge .",
    "if we were to include the @xmath212 term then the oscillatory solutions would exist for positive and negative @xmath96 , however we could not match a convergent solution for positive @xmath96 with one for negative @xmath96 .",
    "we thus see that without the @xmath212 term , the model has very attractive features and the construction of the physical hilbert space is greatly simplified since there exists a normalizable solution .",
    "a question remains as to the relevance of the simplified constraint to that of standard lqc : are these special results specific to the simplified model ? if we remove the @xmath212 term from the difference equation of _ standard lqc _",
    ", it can be shown that the model with a cosmological constant does indeed exhibit similar behavior . to show this ,",
    "the difference equation must be solved numerically since it is more complicated .",
    "consider that we start at large negative @xmath96 with some initial conditions of the wave function and we evolve forward toward the classical singularity .",
    "for large negative @xmath96 the two independent solutions of the difference equation behave in a characteristic manner .",
    "the difference equation for large @xmath218 is approximated by the difference equation of our simplified model .",
    "therefore , for large and negative @xmath96 the two independent solutions behave as @xmath219 and @xmath220 which can be shown from the asymptotic expressions of the solutions in equation ( [ lsolution ] ) . for generic initial conditions",
    "the solution will be a linear combination of @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "as we evolve toward the singularity @xmath221 rapidly dominates over @xmath222 . in this manner numerically the contribution of the decaying solution @xmath222 becomes negligible in comparison with the contribution of @xmath221 thus effectively selecting the latter .",
    "we can perform the same trick starting at large positive @xmath96where the independent solutions behave as @xmath223 and @xmath224and evolving backward to select the @xmath225 component .",
    "the two solutions can then be tested to see if they match somewhere in the region where the behavior is oscillatory .",
    "if the two can be matched then we have found a solution that decays both for positive and negative @xmath96 .    when this analysis is performed for the difference equation of lqc with a cosmological constant ( without the @xmath212 term )",
    "the result is a match only in one sector which corresponds approximately to the one picked out by our simplified model and given by @xmath226 . in the other sectors",
    "the matching can not be achieved which implies for instance that a solution that decays toward @xmath227 will evolve into one that diverges toward @xmath228 .",
    "since the falloff behavior at large positive and negative @xmath96 is sufficiently fast we can say that the solution that does not diverge is kinematically normalizable as in our simplified model .",
    "the solution is plotted in figure ( [ lqc_norm ] ) .",
    "it has the same qualitative behavior as the normalizable solution of the simplified constraint ( compare to figures [ l_smalla ] and [ l_largea ] ) .",
    "we are currently investigating whether a normalizable solution exists for a massless scalar field in the closed model .",
    "a recent paper has pointed out that in this model all the solutions diverge either for large positive or negative @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "the question is raised that this implies that the wave function then predicts a large ` probability ' for the universe being in those regions which are classically forbidden for this model .",
    "notice however that any question about probabilities can only be addressed if a notion of physical inner product is provided .",
    "the physical inner product can solve this apparent problem by providing a non trivial probability measure that makes the physical states normalizable .",
    "we have shown for our model that most solutions have divergent behavior yet the physical inner product singles out a solution all the other ill - behaved solutions have zero norm  which is finite everywhere and even kinematically normalizable .",
    "therefore it is interesting to explore whether this might occur with the model of @xcite .",
    "if a normalizable solution can be found which decays for large volume then the problems raised would be shown to be nonexistent .",
    "preliminary results indicate that one might be able to find normalizable solutions for this model again provided the @xmath212 term is removed .    ) without the @xmath212 on the r.h.s . here",
    "matter is only in the form of a cosmological constant .",
    "the solution is valued only in a single sector which approximately is given by the same sector of the simplified constraint where @xmath226 .",
    ", width=340,height=226 ]      we now discuss the cosmological implications of the lorentzian model .",
    "a main question is whether or not the quantum theory cures the classical singularity .",
    "a classical singularity would exhibit itself in the quantum theory in two ways : a place where the difference equation breaks down or a place where the operator corresponding to the inverse scale factor is singular .",
    "for both these criteria the model presented here does not exhibit singular behavior .",
    "we see from the figure [ l_smalla ] that the quantum evolution proceeds smoothly through the classical singularity ( @xmath197 ) . from the standpoint of the difference equation",
    "the singularity point is not special .",
    "in addition the operator corresponding to the inverse scale factor is a kinematical operator which has been shown to be bounded in standard loop quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "since the model here shares the same kinematical hilbert space , the results will be the same .",
    "we furthermore see that the physical solution is valued only on discrete values of @xmath96 corresponding to the special sector @xmath180 .",
    "the special sector depends on the value of the cosmological constant and only specific values will select the sector @xmath229 which passes through @xmath230 .",
    "thus , it is most likely that the physical solution completely avoids the singularity .",
    "the singularity is thus cured in the model .",
    "if the model does not exhibit singular behavior then another question is what happens when the universe approaches the singularity .",
    "the plot in figure [ l_smalla ] shows that the solution decays rapidly for negative values of @xmath96 while it oscillates for positive values .",
    "thus it is natural to interpret the region of negative @xmath96 as a classically forbidden region and the singularity as a barrier off which the universe bounces .",
    "this is in contrast to standard loop quantum cosmology where semi - classical universes exist for both negative and positive @xmath96 thus opening the possibility for the universe to tunnel through the singularity from one region to the other .",
    "again , the main difference arises from the @xmath212 term in the difference equation . from this",
    "we can make the interpretation that a classical collapsing universe approaching the singularity completely avoids it and bounces leading to an expanding universe .",
    "finally , there is the issue of boundary proposals . in wheeler - dewitt quantization there",
    "exist two independent solutions for de sitter space and ad - hoc boundary proposals are added to pick out a solution . in standard loop quantum cosmology",
    "the dynamical initial condition is used to pick out a solution . however , the dynamical initial condition only singles out a solution for the sector that passes through the singularity .",
    "semi - classical arguments are then used to fix the wave function in the other sectors ( see figure [ l_smallb ] ) .",
    "in contrast we see that for the simplified model here , it is the physical inner product that selects a unique wave function . there is no need to supplement the quantum theory with an ad - hoc boundary proposal .",
    "this is not surprising for this model as the constraint equation is first order in the connection representation . the question remains as to whether this is relevant in more general situations .      at this stage and in the context of the model presented here one question seems natural : what have we gained by setting up the theory on the non separable kinematical hilbert space given by the bohr compactification of the real line ?",
    "the answer is clear in that considering quasi - periodic functions of @xmath13 is the analog of considering cylindrical functions of the connection defined on arbitrary graphs in the full theory . had we defined the quantum theory by using functions of a fixed periodicity ( allowing @xmath231 for @xmath232 ) we would have missed the physical solution @xmath185 and the physical hilbert space would have been @xmath233-dimensional . only in the special case when @xmath234 is an integer could we have found the physical state by starting with a formulation on a fixed ` lattice ' , i.e. , where @xmath231 ( see equation ( [ normedsol ] ) ) . in any other case using a fixed lattice would have resulted in a zero dimensional physical hilbert space . in our model",
    ", the physical inner product selects a given set of ` graphs ' by selecting a periodicity of the relevant modes .",
    "thus the bohr compactification is necessary to capture the correct physics .",
    "another related issue is that the physical hilbert space separates into orthogonal subspaces . in the standard quantizations of the hamiltonian constraint in the literature",
    "the curvature term is written in terms of holonomies along paths whose length is determined by the parameter @xmath108 . due to",
    "this fact one introduces an intrinsic periodicity to the constraint .",
    "it is easy to see that the generalized projection operator associated to such a quantization satisfies the following property @xmath235 for @xmath236 for @xmath237 . in this manner",
    "the physical hilbert space is separated into isolated sectors with no quantum interference between them .     which in this case occurs for large volumes .",
    ", width=340,height=226 ]    a direct consequence of this is the fact that in a given sector the physical solutions have a built in periodicity in that @xmath238 which implies that physically @xmath239 .",
    "this is a puzzling feature as @xmath13 is directly related to the extrinsic curvature which classically does not have such a bound . in the model with a cosmological constant , classically the extrinsic curvature grows as the volume of the universe increases until at some volume it reaches a critical value corresponding to @xmath240 . at values of @xmath96 on the order of this critical value the behavior of the wave function changes dramatically and deviates from that expected from standard wheeler - dewitt quantization .",
    "this is a generic property that applies to all models of lqc ( see figure [ lqc_wd ] ) .",
    "however , it is in this region that both prescriptions should coincide . by decreasing the value of @xmath108",
    "one can extend the region where lqc and wheeler - dewitt quantization agree , yet this parameter is argued to be fixed by the full theory by considering the smallest area eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "it is surprising that a parameter arising from the fundamental discreetness at planck scale should have such a important effect at large scales where the universe is expected to behave classically .",
