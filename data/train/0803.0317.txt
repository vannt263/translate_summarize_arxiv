    "the extreme mass ratio limit of general relativity s two - body problem has been a major focus of work in recent years .",
    "this limit corresponds to a stellar mass compact object that orbits and perturbs a massive black hole .",
    "the system generates gravitational waves ( gws ) which drive the small body to inspiral into the large black hole . measuring such `` extreme mass ratio inspiral , '' or _",
    "emri _ , events is a major goal for space - based gw antennae , particularly the lisa mission .",
    "emris should be measurable to a redshift @xmath0 .",
    "the event rate at this range is estimated to be high enough that a multiyear lisa mission should measure dozens to hundreds of emri events @xcite . because the smaller body only slightly perturbs the larger black hole s spacetime ,",
    "emri gws are expected to provide an exceptionally clean probe of black hole properties .",
    "we expect to use emris to measure black hole masses and spins with extremely good accuracy @xcite , and even to test how well the spacetime meets the rather stringent constraints that the `` no - hair '' theorems of general relativity impose on black holes @xcite .",
    "understanding emri sources will require us to compare measured waves with theoretical models that are as accurate as possible .",
    "this goal motivates much recent emri work .",
    "the waves are sufficiently complicated that simply _ detecting _ them in lisa s datastream will be a challenge .",
    "techniques for finding these events are currently being developed and tested through the `` mock lisa data challenges '' , or mldcs ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for overviews of recent mldcs ) . an important input to these challenges ( and to the development of emri measurement techniques more generally ) are waveform models that capture the true complexity of emri events ( see @xcite for discussion of recent work to include emri waves in the mldcs ) .",
    "this paper presents a further step in our program to construct accurate emri wave models . as discussed in the introduction to ref .",
    "@xcite ( paper i ) , our goal is to make `` adiabatic '' waveforms  waveforms built by separately treating the long - time dissipative evolution and the short - time conservative motion . in our present analysis , we take the short - time motion to be a geodesic orbit of the background spacetime ; our approach thus amounts to approximating the inspiral trajectory as a sequence of geodesic orbits . as discussed by pound and poisson @xcite ,",
    "this limit is more properly a `` radiative '' or `` dissipative '' approximation , since we do not include conservative self interactions . it may be possible to augment this analysis with at least some conservative effects @xcite , so we believe the program we are developing is capable of building truly adiabatic inspiral waveforms as described in @xcite .",
    "we will describe our goal as `` adiabatic '' waveforms , but the reader should bear in mind that the approximation we are currently developing is more restricted than this .",
    "geodesic orbits are described ( up to initial conditions ) by three conserved constants : energy @xmath1 , axial angular momentum @xmath2 , and `` carter constant '' @xmath3 . using black hole perturbation theory , we compute the rate at which these three constants evolve ; fast and accurate frequency - domain codes make it possible to compute these rates of change fairly easily @xcite .",
    "we then build the parameter - space trajectory @xmath4 $ ] followed by the small body ; choosing initial conditions , it is simple to build the coordinate - space worldline @xmath5 $ ] of a particular inspiral . from this worldline",
    ", we build the source to a time - domain code .",
    "the output of this code is , at last , our model emri wave .      since the frequency - domain portion of this program is already well in hand , our current focus is on the time - domain code .",
    "in essence , our goal is to build a code which takes as input any physically reasonable worldline , and provides as output the waveform produced by a small body on this worldline . in paper",
    "i , we demonstrated an accurate ( 2 + 1)d numerical code to solve , in the time domain , the wave equation for curvature perturbations to a black hole  the teukolsky equation @xcite .",
    "our code evolves the weyl curvature scalar @xmath6 , constructed by projecting the vacuum curvature onto appropriate components of a null tetrad ; see paper i for details .",
    "the azimuthal dependence of @xmath6 is separated out ( due to the @xmath7 symmetry of black holes ) ; the dependence on the boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is found by evolving @xmath6 on a numerical @xmath8-@xmath9 grid .    as is common in black hole perturbation theory , we treat the smaller body as a dirac - delta point particle , leading to a singular source for the teukolsky equation . in the frequency domain",
    ", the delta can be dealt with analytically , and presents no great challenge . by constrast ,",
    "accurately computing the effect of a sharp source on the time - domain code s numerical grid can be extremely challenging . in paper",
    "i , we presented a new technique for treating the singular source term .",
    "our innovation was to model the delta as a series of finite impulses , with the largest impulse located close to the delta s argument , falling off rapidly as we move away from this `` central '' spike .",
    "importantly , this approach allows us to accurately model the _ derivatives _ of the delta function .",
    "since the teukolsky equation source depends on first and second derivatives of the delta ( as well as the delta itself ) , this appears to give us an accuracy boost relative to other finite - difference delta representations ( such as a truncated gaussian ) , which may accurately capture the delta s behavior , but not do so well with the derivatives .",
    "paper i focused on the properties of this new source representation . to clarify this focus",
    ", we studied very simple orbits : we only considered the ( astrophysically unlikely ) case of circular , equatorial black hole orbits .",
    "we now extend this to include inclined , eccentric and generic orbits , as well as non - geodesic inspiral sequences .    a particle in a circular",
    ", equatorial orbit has constant radial and angular coordinate , confining it to a fixed location on the @xmath8-@xmath9 grid .",
    "eccentricity means that the orbit oscillates radially , crossing radial grid zones .",
    "similarly , orbital inclination results in angular grid crossing .",
    "we quickly discovered that these new motions introduce high frequency numerical noise .",
    "this noise can be controlled by combining a low pass filter with a higher order discretization of the delta function ; details are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : delta ] . aside from this mild extension of the basic formalism presented in paper i , it was not terribly difficult to use our new source term to handle a broad class of astrophysically interesting orbits .",
    "to validate our results , we present in sec .  [ sec : comparisons ] extensive comparisions with waveform snapshots computed in the frequency domain @xcite , demonstrating graphically and quantitatively ( with appropriate overlap integrals ) excellent agreement between the two techniques .",
    "as extensively discussed in the introduction to paper i and here , our goal is to compute the waves from inspiral of a small body through a sequence of orbits . as a proof - of - concept demonstration of the feasibility of this idea , we present a simple example of inspiral in sec .  [ sec : inspiral ] . in this example",
    ", we evolve through our geodesic sequence using a `` kludged '' approximation to the rates of change of orbital constants , using the code described in refs .",
    "these waveforms are not reliable emri models , but they illustrate the ease with which we can handle the effect of radiation emission on the motion of the source . computing waves from an inspiral is no more of a computational challenge than computing waves from a bound geodesic .    the next step will be to combine accurate radiative backreaction with our time - domain solver to compute `` adiabatic '' emri waveforms ( albeit ones that still neglect conservative self interactions ) .",
    "plans for this next step are described in our final summary , sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "in paper i , we presented a method for representing a dirac delta function and its derivatives on a discrete numerical grid . in that paper , we only considered a delta with fixed radial and angular position .",
    "naive application of the discrete delta models presented in paper i leads to instabilities when the particle moves in the numerical grid .",
    "the following argument outlines the root cause of these instabilities .",
    "consider the function @xmath11 $ ] , where @xmath12 ; i.e. , the delta s peak varies with time and lies between two discrete grid points .",
    "let @xmath13 represent any discrete point on our grid , and let @xmath14 be the grid resolution .",
    "naive application of the results from paper i might lead us to model the delta function with the impulse weights @xmath15 ( this `` two impulse '' delta is in fact just the simplest representation we developed in paper i , but is useful for the following discussion . ) each @xmath16 defines a time slice of our @xmath8-@xmath9 grid . as @xmath17 varies from one time slice to another , so do the coefficients at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the frequency spectrum of @xmath20 and @xmath21 will reflect the amount of variation in @xmath17 .",
    "a large variation in @xmath17 will produce a high frequency component in the fourier transform of the time series of each weight .",
    "these variations couple to the time derivatives in the homogeneous part of the teukolsky equation .",
    "consequently , the solution contains spurious high frequency features of numerical origin .",
    "consider the extreme limit of this effect : @xmath17 changes so rapidly that the delta s peak moves across a grid zone in a single time slice : @xmath22 so that @xmath23 but @xmath24 the weight of the delta function very suddenly becomes zero at @xmath19 as we step from @xmath25 to @xmath26 ; likewise , the weight at @xmath27 very suddenly jumps from non - zero to zero in this step .",
    "the coupling of this sudden change to numerical time derivatives drives instabilities in our code , in a manner reminiscent of the initial burst of radiation that occurs due to the sudden appearance of the particle at the start of our evolution ; see fig .  2 of paper i.    this problem",
    "is substantially mitigated by using a delta representation with a wider stencil ; examples of this are described in paper i. wide stencils reduce the amount by which each weight changes from step to step , thereby reducing numerical noise .",
    "another useful tool is to increase the order of the delta representation , thereby increasing the smoothness of the delta and its derivatives .",
    "this is particularly important since the teukolsky equation is a second - order differential equation ; some smoothness in the derivatives is necessary to prevent the differential operator from seeding excessive noise .",
    "finally , residual high frequency noise can be removed by convolving the source with a low pass filter .",
    "these three techniques are each described in the following subsections .",
    "each of these techniques smear out the delta function , pushing us away from the idealization of a zero width singularity .",
    "choosing between stability ( which tends to push us to a wider delta ) and faithful representation of the singularity ( which pushes us to a narrow delta ) leads us to an optimization problem ; we tune our delta representation in a way that ( hopefully ) minimizes numerical noise and maximizes accuracy .",
    "note also that , in addition to high - frequency noise generated by abrupt movement of the delta across the grid , spurious excitations of the quasinormal modes of the black hole also appear due this motion .",
    "this source of `` noise '' appears to be controlled by grid resolution  wider grids lead to less pointlike deltas , which spuriously excite these modes .",
    "this spurious contribution to the emri waves can be mitigated with a form of richardson extrapolation @xcite .",
    "we discuss this further in sec .",

    "having demonstrated that the finite - impulse source works well for astrophysically relevant generic black hole orbits , we now examine how well we do evolving through a sequence of such orbits . since each orbit in the sequence is no different than the orbits that we validated against in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] , we anticipate no great difficulty here",
    ". indeed , the biggest challenge is choosing a method to evolve through our sequence . our goal is to do this with a frequency - domain code to build the orbital - constant trajectory @xmath177 $ ] . to quickly produce results that are qualitatively correct",
    ", we presently make this trajectory using the `` kludge '' inspiral treatment described in ref .",
    "@xcite , and used to make model waveforms in ref .",
    "the `` kludge '' uses a somewhat idiosyncratic mix of post - newtonian backreaction formulae combined with numerical results from frequency - domain backreaction in the circular , inclined ( @xmath178 , @xmath179 ) and eccentric , equatorial ( @xmath180 , @xmath181 ) limits to estimate the properties of emri waves . by construction ,",
    "the results agree very well with teukolsky - based inspirals in those limits ; for the generic case , they produce plausible inspirals .",
    "-1 cm    figure [ inspiral_wave ] shows our waveform for a `` kludge '' inspiral .",

    "this figure shows features reminiscent of the geodesic snapshots shown in figs .",
    "[ tdfd_m2_eqecc ] , [ tdfd_m2_gen ] , and [ tdfd_m3_incl ] ; in addition , one can clearly see evolution of the wave s properties .",
    "the increase in the wave s frequency , largely due to the decay of the orbit s semi - latus rectum , is quite clear . perhaps less obvious",
    "is a signature of the eccentricity s decay .",
    "this is illustrated most clearly by comparing the lower left and lower right panels of fig .",
    "[ inspiral_wave ] , which zoom onto early and late portions of the inspiral .",
    "early on , the waveform is dominated by a series of high - frequency bursts ; these occur when the small body passes through periapsis and `` whirls '' most rapidly about the massive black hole .",
    "there is then a relatively quiet section while the body `` zooms '' out to apoapsis , and then comes in to `` whirl '' at periapsis again .",
    "as eccentricity shrinks , the difference between periapsis and apoapsis becomes smaller .",
    "the high - frequency bursts crowd closer and closer together , approaching a continuum sinusoid as the eccentricity approaches zero .",
    "although this inspiral model is somewhat unphysical , we expect that it shares many properties with true adiabatic inspiral waveforms .",
    "in particular , the spectral evolution of a wave like that in fig .",
    "[ inspiral_wave ] should be quite similar to the evolution of real emri waveforms .",
    "it should be emphasized that computing the waveform shown in fig .",
    "[ inspiral_wave ] required about as much computational effort as computing the geodesic snapshot waves , figs .   [ tdfd_m2_eqecc ] , [ tdfd_m2_gen ] , and [ tdfd_m3_incl ] ( modulo a factor @xmath187@xmath188 since the waveform in fig .",
    "[ inspiral_wave ] lasts @xmath187@xmath188 times longer than the others ) .",
    "given a robust code to generate the inspiral worldline of emri systems , the waveforms that our code produces should be a useful tool for examining issues in lisa measurement and data analysis .",
    "we have now shown that the finite impulse delta representation of the time - domain teukolsky equation s source works very well for complicated and astrophysically relevant orbits . in our previous analysis ( @xcite , paper i )",
    ", we confined ourselves to the simplest circular , equatorial black hole orbits .",
    "the basic ideas from paper i work well even when the source arises from highly inclined and highly eccentric orbits , and when the source evolves through a sequence of those orbits .",
    "it is now a relatively straightforward matter to compute the waves arising from a body following any reasonably behaved worldline in the spacetime of a black hole .",
    "the primary complication arising from these more generic orbit classes is that the orbiting body will cross zones within our numerical grid .",
    "the source thus becomes dynamical ; the finite - impulse delta must likewise be dynamical to represent it .",
    "the evolution of the impulses that we use to represent the delta can seed numerical noise , reducing the calculation s accuracy .",
    "we have found that minor extensions of paper i s basic techniques greatly mitigate the impact of this source of numerical noise . in particular , by using a higher - order representation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : highorder ] ) , the delta is smoothed enough that the coupling to the teukolsky equation s second - order differential operators does not seed much error . widening the delta s stencil ( sec .  [",
    "sec : widestencils ] ) also helps , since the fractional change in a given impulse will be less if the delta is represented by more impulses .",
    "finally , residual high frequency noise not removed by these techniques can be taken out by convolving the teukolsky source term with a low - pass ( gaussian ) filter ( sec .",
    "[ sec : smoothing ] ) .",
    "it s worth emphasizing that we smooth the entire source term , not just the delta function ( which would arguably make our delta rather similar to the truncated gaussian @xcite which this technique was designed to improve upon ) .",
    "comparison with results from the frequency - domain @xcite demonstrates that the waveforms generated with this source term are of very high quality ( sec .",
    "[ sec : comparisons ] ) .",
    "visually , the waveforms lie on top of one another in every case that we have examined ; a quantitative overlap integral demonstrates that waveforms from the two calculations are often more than @xmath189 correlated .",
    "a key step in achieving such high quality results is to estimate the largest errors in our time - domain calculations , and then subtract that estimate from our result .",
    "we do this by performing these calculations at two different grid resolutions ; under the assumption that our dominant error is quadratic in grid spacing , we then estimate the magnitude of our error ( appendix [ sec : app ] ) .",
    "the excellent agreement we achieve with frequency - domain results validates this approach , at least for all the cases we have considered .",
    "so far , our main physics accomplishment is excellent agreement between time- and frequency - domain approaches to waveform calculation .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that for waveform calculations , there will be a large set of circumstances in which time - domain codes are more efficient . for generic orbits ,",
    "a frequency - domain code may require the calculation and summation of many thousand multipoles and fourier modes .",
    "a time - domain code `` automatically '' sums over all modes ( except the @xmath190 index ) , so that ( in principle ) it is no more difficult to compute the waves from a highly inclined , highly eccentric black hole orbit than from an orbit with modest inclination and eccentricity .",
    "the real payoff of this tool will come when we allow the source to radiatively decay , evolving through a sequence of orbits . as a demonstration that this can be done , we use a `` kludged '' inspiral to compute a body s inspiral , and then use that inspiral as the source for our time - domain solver in sec .",
    "[ sec : inspiral ] .",
    "though not a physically accurate inspiral , this scenario shares many properties with the actual adiabatic inspiral .",
    "in particular , it demonstrates the computational advantage of a robust time - domain code for computing inspiral waveforms , given the worldline the inspiraling body follows .",
    "future work will address our goal of complete waveforms for the emri problem , in the context of the dissipation - only approximation to emri dynamics .",
    "we have recently extended our frequency - domain code to include the evolution of carter s constant in the radiative backreaction limit @xcite , and will use this code to produce the radiation reaction data describing an inspiraling body . with this step in hand ,",
    "no issue of principle stands in the way of coupling the time- and frequency - domain approaches to make usefully accurate emri waveforms .",
