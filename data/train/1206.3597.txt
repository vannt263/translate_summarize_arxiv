    "to perform the measurements , the same un crystal utilized by jackman _",
    "et al_@xcite was aligned with the ( @xmath2 ) plane horizontal and cooled to a temperature t  @xmath3  5  k. figure  [ phonons](a ) shows representative results obtained at sequoia using incident neutron energy @xmath4  @xmath3  80  mev for a typical symmetry direction in reciprocal space .",
    "a constant @xmath5-cut through the data , at the position corresponding to the vertical line , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ phonons](b ) .",
    "the solid red curve is a fit to a superposition of gaussian peaks at the mode positions .",
    "the measured phonon dispersion relations are consistent with earlier investigations@xcite . the black lines in fig .",
    "[ phonons](a ) are obtained from a fit of the data to a simplified model@xcite that includes only nearest - neighbour u - n ( 65  @xmath6  2  n / m ) and u - u ( 50  @xmath6  4",
    "n / m ) force constants .",
    "this model suffices for illustrative purposes , although more detailed models@xcite give a closer match to the observed dispersion .",
    "some of those models also include n - n force constants , although they are found to be negligibly small compared to their u - n and u - u counterparts .",
    "notably , the optic modes are well - separated in energy from the acoustic modes and are weakly - dispersive centered around @xmath0  @xmath7  50  mev@xcite . due to the large mass ratio @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the masses of the u and n atoms respectively",
    ", the eigenvectors of the modes are such that the u atom motions are largely reflected by the acoustic phonons and the optic modes correspond primarily to motions of the n atoms@xcite .    the upper and lower panels in fig .",
    "[ phonons](c ) and ( d ) show sequoia data taken with @xmath4  @xmath3  250  mev covering a larger range of energy transfer .",
    "the upper panel shows the data averaged over all measured crystal orientations and the lower panel is a plot of intensity vs. energy transfer for this data summed over @xmath5 .",
    "the data is striking and reveals a series of essentially dispersionless excitations extending up in energy from the optic mode , and evenly spaced by approximately 50  mev intervals .",
    "the intensity of each mode increases with increasing momentum transfer over several  @xmath11  indicating that these excitations are vibrational as opposed to magnetic .",
    "these data were extended greatly in both energy and wavevector range by further measurements using the arcs chopper spectrometer .",
    "figures  [ high_energy_data](a ) and ( b ) show arcs data with @xmath4  @xmath3  500  mev plotted on a logarithmic intensity scale .",
    "figures  [ high_energy_data](c ) and ( d ) show data from the same instrument with @xmath4  @xmath3  800  mev ; the upper panel ( c ) has intensity on a linear scale while ( d ) is also on a logarithmic scale .",
    "a series of evenly - spaced excitations are clearly visible up to the 10th order at an energy of 500 mev .",
    "the well - defined peaks in the orientationally - averaged data imply that the modes are localized and isotropic .    some enhanced response at an energy corresponding to twice that of the optic phonon was observed in previous neutron scattering studies of un and attributed to two - phonon processes@xcite",
    ". however , the observation of such an extended series of equally - spaced and well - defined modes is unprecedented .",
    "the most obvious system exhibiting a spectrum consisting of equally - spaced modes is the quantum harmonic oscillator ( qho ) . here",
    "one can postulate that the extremely light mass of the n atom relative to the u atom leads to a situation where high frequency vibrations in the crystal essentially consist of motions of individual n atoms in a very isotropic and harmonic potential arising from a surrounding regular octahedron of u atoms .",
    "each n atom is then a nearly ideal realization of the qho in three dimensions , with a fundamental frequency corresponding to an energy @xmath12  @xmath13  50 mev , equivalent to a temperature of 580  k. the qho is one of the simplest and best understood theoretical models in quantum mechanics@xcite , and serves as the foundation for understanding diverse phenomena such as the vibrational modes of molecules , the motion of atoms in a lattice , and the theory of heat capacity .",
    "we show below that the qho model can quantitatively describe the high - energy vibrational features observed in the un data .",
    "the neutron scattering signal expected from the qho is well - known@xcite .",
    "the dynamical response for @xmath14 t  @xmath15  @xmath16 can be written as : @xmath17 where the contribution to the intensity arising from the @xmath18th oscillator excitation is given by : @xmath19 the argument of the exponent resembles a debye - waller factor and reflects the zero - point motion of the oscillator .",
    "it is interesting to note that the intensity maximum for each mode occurs at the @xmath5-position corresponding to the recoil scattering for a free particle of mass @xmath10 ( see supplementary information ) .    equation ( 2 ) reflects the intensity expected for a single inelastic scattering event .",
    "since the modes are evenly spaced , in a real experiment multiple scattering events in any combination of elastic and inelastic scattering will also result in intensity at the positions of the modes .",
    "hence any comparison of the qho theory to the data must account for the intensity arising from multiple scattering in some fashion . as a first approximation ,",
    "the measured data for un was compared to the qho model by fitting constant energy cuts ( 20  mev integration range ) corresponding to the @xmath18  @xmath3  1 - 7 modes for both @xmath4  @xmath3  500  mev and 800  mev data to the following functional form : @xmath20 here the multiple scattering contribution to the observed intensity at each mode position is assumed to be a constant @xmath21 independent of momentum @xmath5 : this is the simplest possible assumption .",
    "figure  [ high_energy_fits](a ) shows the @xmath5-dependence of the seven lowest oscillator modes for the @xmath4  @xmath3  800  mev data with solid lines indicating the corresponding fits to equation ( 3 ) .",
    "the fits are excellent over the entire range of measured data and this is also true for the @xmath4  @xmath3  500  mev data ( not shown ) .",
    "figure  [ high_energy_fits](b ) plots the ratios of the fitted parameters @xmath22 for both data sets .",
    "the solid curve indicates the prediction of the qho model for a nitrogen atom with @xmath23  @xmath3  50  mev , with the non - integer @xmath18 values interpolated by using @xmath24 to calculate @xmath25 .",
    "the values obtained from the data agree very well with the model over nearly 20 orders of magnitude .",
    "the maximum relative deviation for any one ratio is within a factor of two for the @xmath4  @xmath3  800  mev data and within 20  % for the @xmath4  @xmath3  500  mev data . given the large range of values covered and the simple assumption made for the multiple scattering , this is strong confirmation that the qho picture applies to the nitrogen atoms in the uranium lattice .",
    "the magnitude of the fitted parameters @xmath21 are found to be monotonically - decreasing with energy and dependent on the incident neutron energy .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic multiple scattering contribution to the intensity at the mode position the value of @xmath21 may be affected by background terms .",
    "the background can arise from several sources , including overlap of the oscillator modes due to imperfect instrumental resolution , and contributions from acoustic - acoustic and acoustic - optic multiphonon excitations .",
    "the observation that the high @xmath18 modes are visible at low @xmath5 implies that the intrinsic multiple scattering contribution to @xmath21 is larger than the other background terms .",
    "more discussion of the @xmath21 parameter is provided in the supplementary information .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 is related to the zero point energy of the oscillator . for a nitrogen atom in a harmonic potential corresponding to @xmath27  mev the calculated value of @xmath26 is 3.0x10@xmath28  @xmath29 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath26 determined from all modes at both incident energies was found to be 2.75(10)x10@xmath28  @xmath29 ; this is very close to the calculated value . as a further check",
    ", the data for each @xmath30 was analyzed using a global fit ( see supplementary information ) obtaining values for @xmath26 of 2.76(2)x10@xmath28  @xmath31 and 2.64(2)x10@xmath28  @xmath31 for the @xmath4  @xmath3  500  mev and 800  mev data sets respectively , also in good agreement with expectations .",
    "the slight discrepancies between the fitted and calculated @xmath26 values may be due to the simple assumption made for the multiple scattering .",
    "clearly , the qho model gives an outstanding description of the data .",
    "it should be noted that a calculation of the multiphonon scattering for a single frequency , perfectly - dispersionless einstein model leads to a result that is equivalent to the qho model@xcite .",
    "however , the oscillator picture is a simpler and more physically reasonable description for the localized vibrations of n atoms in un , particularly when one considers that it is not an ideal einstein solid : the crystalline environment and acoustic modes also affect the scattering .",
    "detailed theoretical predictions exist for the response of a binary harmonic solid consisting of a lattice of diatomic molecules with a light atom of mass @xmath10 bound to a heavier atom of mass @xmath9@xcite . in the limit @xmath32 , appropriate for un",
    ", the finite mass of the u atoms can be accounted for approximately by replacing the delta function in equation  ( 2 ) with a gaussian : @xmath33 this modification suggests that the oscillator modes should be broadened to a width @xmath34 and the position of the @xmath18th mode shifted by the uranium recoil to @xmath35  @xmath3  @xmath36 . for un ,",
    "it is not possible to associate a specific n atom with an individual u atom , nevertheless it is still reasonable to compare the data with the binary solid model . to assess",
    "how well this model describes the present data , constant-@xmath5 cuts ( 2  @xmath11  integration range ) from the arcs @xmath4  @xmath3  500  mev measurement were fit to a superposition of several gaussian functions .",
    "the net result of the fitting shows that the modes have an average intrinsic full - width half - maximum of 26 mev with no systematic behavior evident as a function of @xmath5 or @xmath18 ( see supplementary information ) .",
    "the magnitude of the broadening is in agreement with the prediction of the binary solid model@xcite that the intrinsic energy width of the @xmath37 peaks should be of the same order as the bandwidth of the acoustic phonon modes .",
    "inspection of figure 2(a ) shows this width to be slightly over 20  mev . except for a possible small effect in the @xmath38 mode ,",
    "the fitting does not reveal a measurable shift of the mode energies as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "multiple scattering contributions at the mode positions may mask any shift at higher @xmath5 .    in order to investigate why the isotropic qho description is so appropriate for un ,",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) has been used to calculate the potential energy of the nitrogen atoms relative to their equilibrium positions for displacements along major crystallographic directions .",
    "although dft often fails to give the true ground state for correlated materials , in fact it has been shown to give a good description of the electronic energies in un@xcite .",
    "moreover , dft gives highly reliable values for relative energy differences of displaced atoms independent of the precise ground state .",
    "the dft results shown in fig .",
    "[ dft ] verify that the potential is harmonic over a wide energy range , certainly for @xmath39  @xmath40  1  ev . at the same time , in this range the potential energy along different directions is isotropic to within 2  % .",
    "the ab - initio calculations predict an energy spacing for the oscillator modes of 50  mev , corresponding very well to the spacing of the excitations observed in the neutron scattering measurements .",
    "the qho behavior observed here should be visible in many materials where the constituent atoms have greatly different masses .",
    "it is also important that there be weak interactions between light atoms sitting in a very harmonic potential .",
    "possible harmonic oscillator behavior has long been sought and investigated in metallic hydrides , especially for zirconium and titanium systems@xcite .",
    "however , the potentials at the hydrogen sites generally show significant anisotropy or anharmonic effects@xcite .",
    "these features manifest themselves as fine structure and uneven spacing in the hydrogen vibrational modes , and they arise from h - h interactions , crystalline anisotropy , and low potential barriers to hopping of the protons . in sharp contrast , the potential at the nitrogen sites of un is very harmonic and isotropic , leading to evenly - spaced nitrogen vibrational modes exhibiting no fine structure within the instrumental energy resolution . to the best of our knowledge , each nitrogen atom in un is a unique manifestation of a single atom qho",
    ".    the scattering of neutrons from the oscillator modes may be an important factor in the consideration of un as a nuclear fuel material .",
    "uranium nitride has several desirable characteristics for this application , including excellent thermal conductivity and a high melting temperature .",
    "for that reason , it is currently under intense consideration for use in proposed generation iv nuclear reactors@xcite , which operate at high temperatures ( 500 - 1000@xmath41c ) , allowing for improved efficiency in the conversion of heat to electricity .",
    "nuclear reactor designs require a detailed knowledge of the neutron cross - sections and thermal behavior of the constituent atoms composing the nuclear fuel .",
    "fermi@xcite showed that harmonic oscillations of protons in metals have a significant measurable effect on total neutron cross - sections .",
    "in addition to affecting the total cross - section , the oscillator modes in un could also impact operation via self - moderation of neutrons .",
    "the modes will be thermally - populated at the proposed generation iv operating temperatures and it is necessary to understand if there will be any impact on the thermal conductivity . given the strong scattering processes shown in the present work , it is clear that the oscillator excitations must be accounted for properly in any detailed generation iv designs .",
    "for the neutron scattering experiments , the un single crystal was sealed in an ultrathin al sample can@xcite with he exchange gas and cooled to approximately 5  k in a closed cycle he refrigerator . for the sequoia@xcite measurements ,",
    "a fermi chopper with a slit spacing of 3.6  mm and a radius of curvature of 1.53  m was spun at 300  hz and 360  hz for @xmath4  @xmath3  80  mev and 250  mev respectively , yielding fwhm energy resolutions of 4 and 6  % of @xmath4 at the elastic line .",
    "the data was accumulated by combining measurements taken with several different incident neutron directions in the @xmath42 $ ] plane .",
    "the data from arcs was obtained using a chopper with an identical radius of curvature and outer dimensions to the sequoia fermi chopper described above , but with a slit spacing of 0.5  mm .",
    "the chopper was spun at 480  hz ( @xmath4= 500 mev ) or 600  hz for ( @xmath4= 800  mev ) to yield a fwhm energy resolution of 3.5  % of @xmath4 at the elastic line .",
    "the sample was rotated continuously between the @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath44 $ ] directions during data collection . in all measurements ,",
    "the data was normalized to account for variations of the detector response and solid angle coverage with a vanadium standard .",
    "this procedure enabled an accurate determination of the orientationally - averaged scattering response .",

    "as discussed in the manuscript , constant @xmath39-cuts of the arcs @xmath4  @xmath3  500  mev and 800  mev data corresponding to the @xmath18th oscillator mode were fit to the functional form : @xmath20 these fits placed no constraints on @xmath49 and @xmath26 , and so these parameters were allowed to vary with @xmath18 and independently of one another . to compare the fitting results to the quantum harmonic oscillator ( qho ) model",
    ", it was necessary to normalize @xmath49 with respect to @xmath50 to account for a common scale factor in the neutron data .",
    "the normalized @xmath49 values agree well with the qho model@xcite and all of the @xmath26 values were determined to be within 20  % of one another , with the average value obtained from fits to both the @xmath4  @xmath3  500  mev and 800  mev data given by 2.75(10)x10@xmath28  @xmath31 .",
    "although including the @xmath21 term was necessary for fitting the data , it is not explained by the qho model .",
    "the magnitude of this term is plotted in fig .",
    "[ s1](a ) for arcs data with incident energies of both @xmath4  @xmath3  500 and 800  mev , and it accounts for both a background and an intrinsic contribution to the oscillator excitation .",
    "the background term arises from overlap of the oscillator modes due to imperfect instrumental resolution , plus a contribution from multiphonon excitations involving only the acoustic modes or some combination of the acoustic and optic modes .",
    "the resolution overlap is illustrated by two features in the data .",
    "first , the decreasing @xmath21 values with increasing @xmath18 arise from the fact that the resolution is a monotonically - decreasing function of energy transfer@xcite .",
    "second , the energy resolution is also finer for smaller @xmath4 , thus explaining the decrease of the @xmath21 parameters with decreasing @xmath4 .",
    "the multiphonon contribution is illustrated most clearly by considering sequoia data with @xmath4  @xmath3  150  mev averaged over all measured crystallographic orientations and plotted in fig .",
    "[ s1](b ) .",
    "a series of peaks are visible at 15  mev , 50  mev , 65  mev , and 100  mev .",
    "the lowest peak corresponds to the acoustic zone boundary phonon modes , while the peaks at 50  mev and 100  mev correspond to the @xmath18  @xmath3  1 and 2 oscillator modes .",
    "the weak peak at 65  mev is a multiphonon excitation corresponding to a zone boundary acoustic plus optic phonon mode , but can not be clearly observed in spectra with higher incident energies due to coarser instrumental energy resolution .",
    "most importantly , multiple scattering due to any combination of elastic scattering and inelastic scattering events from oscillator modes results in intensity at higher order oscillator mode positions .",
    "this plausibly leads to a @xmath5-independent contribution to intensity at the position of the @xmath18th excitation .",
    "the experiments used a rather large single crystal sample originally designed for weak magnetic scattering experiments@xcite .",
    "simple considerations taking into account the size of the crystal and the total scattering cross - sections for u@xmath51 and n confirm that significant multiple scattering is present .",
    "the @xmath5 dependence of the multiple scattering should be much weaker and governed by a relatively constant functional form , one much different than the qho .",
    "next order dependencies of the multiple scattering are difficult to model and are irrelevant to the conclusions of this work . for these reasons , treating this contribution as @xmath5-independent serves as a reasonable approximation .",
    "another way of fitting the constant @xmath39-cuts is to assume that @xmath49 and @xmath26 are directly related to one another as described by the qho model .",
    "specifically , @xmath49  @xmath3  @xmath52 and @xmath26  @xmath3  @xmath53 , where @xmath10 is the nitrogen mass and @xmath12 is the fundamental energy of the qho .",
    "one can then fit all of the oscillator modes with two common parameters , namely @xmath26 and a scale factor , along with a different @xmath21 parameter for each mode . using this alternative method ,",
    "the @xmath26 parameter was found to be 2.76(2)x10@xmath28  @xmath31 and 2.64(2)x10@xmath28  @xmath31 for the @xmath4  @xmath3  500  mev and 800  mev data sets respectively .",
    "a series of constant @xmath39-cuts taken from the @xmath4  @xmath3  500  mev data with the corresponding fits from this second method superimposed are shown in fig .",
    "[ s2](a ) .",
    "the excellent agreement between the two methods demonstrates that the results for the fitting parameters are robust .",
    "however , the fitted @xmath26 values are somewhat lower than the expected value of 3x10@xmath28  @xmath31 obtained by assuming @xmath23  @xmath3  50  mev and an atomic mass of 14 .",
    "it is possible that some of this discrepancy may be related to the simple assumption made for the @xmath21 terms described above .",
    "an experimental value of @xmath12 can be determined by directly fitting the mode positions , since these will be largely unaffected by multiple scattering .",
    "an overall average estimate can be obtained by fitting @xmath5-integrated data to a superposition of gaussian functions with the energy of the @xmath18th mode constrained to be @xmath54 ; a representative fit of this type to the arcs @xmath4  @xmath3  500  mev data is shown in fig .",
    "[ s2](b ) .",
    "this procedure yielded an average value of @xmath23  @xmath3  50.2(3 ) mev for the sequoia data and 51.7(1 ) mev for the arcs data .",
    "the small discrepancy in @xmath12 obtained from the two spectrometers is most likely due to the difference in the integration range of @xmath5 .",
    "the arcs measurements accessed much higher @xmath5 values , and since the position of the @xmath55 mode was found to increase with @xmath5 as explained below , this should cause a small increase in @xmath12 for the @xmath5-integrated arcs data as compared to the sequoia data .",
    "as discussed in the manuscript , theory@xcite predicts that the oscillator modes of a real binary crystal will be broadened and can be approximated by gaussian functions . in principle , the width of the peaks depends on several factors , including the temperature , wavevector , and the ratio of the fundamental oscillator mode energy to the zone boundary energy of the acoustic phonon modes .",
    "the width involves a convolution of the acoustic modes and harmonic oscillator response and therefore should be of the same order as the bandwidth of the acoustic modes .",
    "the model also predicts a shift of the oscillator mode positions by an amount corresponding to the uranium recoil scattering .",
    "these predictions were investigated by fitting constant @xmath5-cuts of the data ( 2  @xmath11 integration range ) as well as @xmath5-integrated cuts to a superposition of gaussian functions with independently varying positions and widths . a representative plot of the @xmath4  @xmath3  500  mev arcs data with the corresponding fit",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ s3 ] , and some fitting results are presented in table i and fig .",
    "table i shows that the spacing of the modes agrees well with the estimates of @xmath23 obtained by the constrained fitting as described above .",
    "the oscillator modes were also found to be characterized by intrinsic full - width - half - maxima ( fwhm ) of @xmath13  26  mev as shown in table  i ( assuming that the resolution and sample contributions to the widths add in quadrature ) with no systematic @xmath5 or @xmath18-dependence .",
    "for the peaks with @xmath37 the values are in good agreement with the binary solid model prediction , since the acoustic phonon bandwidth in un is around 20  mev . on the other hand",
    ", while the position of the @xmath18  @xmath3  1 mode increases with @xmath5 roughly according to the uranium recoil scattering as predicted , the higher order mode positions show no @xmath5-variation within the error bars as indicated by both table  i and fig .",
    "therefore , it was not necessary to account for this shift in the analysis of the constant @xmath39-cuts described above .",
    "this deviation from the prediction of the binary solid model may be due to multiple scattering effects that have already been discussed in detail .",
    "it is worth noting that for the @xmath5-integrated data fitting of the width and position of the optic ( @xmath56 ) mode is systematically affected by its proximity to the large peak near zero energy .",
    "the actual width of the @xmath56 mode should be determined by the bandwidth of the optic mode .",
    "in addition , an apparent shift in the average position of the @xmath56 mode as a function of @xmath5 may be due to a combination of dispersion and lack of full orientational - averaging for small @xmath5 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the position of maximum intensity of the @xmath18th oscillator mode in @xmath57 space corresponds to @xmath58 , and this is equivalent to the expression for the nitrogen recoil energy . in the limit of large @xmath4",
    ", the individual oscillator modes are not resolved due to the coarse energy resolution associated with these incident energies , and the resulting overlapping modes clearly trace out the nitrogen recoil curve . to demonstrate this , arcs data with @xmath4  @xmath3  1.5  ev , a fermi chopper frequency of 600  hz , and a fwhm energy resolution of 3.5  %  of  @xmath4  @xmath3  52.5  mev at the elastic line",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the nitrogen recoil is superimposed on the data as indicated by the black curve .",
    "the electronic structure within the density functional theory ( dft ) was obtained using the quantum espresso package@xcite .",
    "the calculation was performed using a plane - wave basis set and ultrasoft pseudopotential@xcite in a rkkj scheme@xcite .",
    "the uranium pseudopotential was obtained from an ionized electronic configuration 6@xmath596@xmath605@xmath617@xmath62 with cutoff radii equal to 3.5 atomic units ( au ) , 1.7 au , 2.6 au and 1.6 au for @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 angular momentum .",
    "the electronic levels deviate from the all - electron ones by less than 0.1  mev .",
    "we used the perdew , burke and ernzerhof@xcite exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the brillouin zone ( bz ) summations were carried out over a 4 x 4 x 4 bz k - points grid for a supercell containing 64 atoms . the electronic smearing with a width of 0.02 ry",
    "was applied according to the methfessel - paxton method .",
    "the plane wave energy and charge density cut - offs were 73 ry and 1054 ry respectively , corresponding to a calculation accuracy of 0.2 mry / atom .",
    "the nitrogen atom potential was obtained from the total energy modification of a 2 x 2 x 2 supercell when one nitrogen atom was shifted from the equilibrium position in the [ 100 ] , [ 110 ] or [ 111 ] directions and the remaining atoms were held fixed in their equilibrium positions .",
