    "in the last two decades significant progress was achieved in the understanding of dynamical processes involving both single particles  electrons and holes  and collective electronic excitations in metallic systems from the so - called _ ab initio _ perspective . in particular ,",
    "in the course of the study of dynamics of electronic excitations the relative importance of such intrinsic processes as electron - phonon and electron - electron decay was thoroughly analyzed.@xcite one of the important results of these investigations was the demonstration of a crucial role of electronic band structure of real solids in such events .    at the same time",
    ", it is known that the band structure can be influenced by spin - orbit ( so ) effects , especially in heavy elements .",
    "remarkable examples are lead , bismuth and bismuth tellurohalides , where the so interaction produces strong modifications of the band structure @xcite and vibrational spectra,@xcite influencing the electron - phonon interaction in these materials .    the effect of the so interaction on the electronic structure was intensively investigated in the past , while the inclusion of this interaction into calculation of dielectric properties from first - principles was performed in few cases only .",
    "thus it was demonstrated that the so interaction induces sizeable effects in the optical properties and dielectric properties in the small momentum transfer limit of heavy elements , in particular pb.@xcite however , a detailed study of the impact of the so interaction on the excitation spectrum of pb over a whole momentum - energy domain is still missing . especially in a low - energy region where the major effect is expected .",
    "this constitutes a main topic of the present study , in such a way giving a whole picture of the low - energy electronic dynamics in the elemental lead in addition to the phonon dynamics studied heavily up to now .",
    "one of the characteristics of lead is that it presents the second - highest critical temperature of all bulk elemental superconductors ( @xmath1 = 7.23 k),@xcite which has been shown to be related to its large electron - phonon coupling ( epc ) constant .",
    "in addition , so coupling has a strong impact on the electron - phonon interaction in bulk pb , increasing its strength as much as @xmath2.@xcite studying the electronic collective excitations near the fermi level ( @xmath3 ) and the so effects on them would complete the description of the low - energy dynamics in bulk lead , and it is done in the present work .    for many years the electron - density response of solids was studied using a free - electron gas ( feg ) model in which the electron valence density is parameterized by a single quantity : the density parameter @xmath4 , which stands for the average inter - electron distance.@xcite the feg model gave insight into basic properties of the momentum- and frequency - dependent dynamical dielectric response .",
    "however , band structure effects that are missing in a feg model frequently can produce strong impact on the dynamical dielectric response of solids .",
    "in particular , interband transitions ( not presented in a feg model ) give rise , for instance , to a strong red shift of the ag plasmon frequency @xcite or to a negative momentum dispersion of the plasmon in cs.@xcite moreover , these transitions can dominate in some materials the energy - loss landscape in the low - energy - transfer domain.@xcite in three - dimensional ( 3d ) solids the feg model predicts the existence of a @xmath4-dependent threshold for collective excitations , exceeding in metals several ev .",
    "hence , according to the feg theory , plasmons can not participate directly in the low - energy dynamical processes near the fermi surface .",
    "however , in the fifties it was predicted@xcite the existence of a very - low energy excitation , which should be present in systems with several energy bands crossing the fermi level with different fermi velocities , @xmath5 , as it is the case of bulk pb .",
    "this very - low energy mode presents an acoustic - like dispersion at small momentum transfers @xmath6 s , i.e. , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the group velocity of the acoustic plasmon being very close to the fermi velocity in the energy band with the slower carriers .",
    "thus , the @xmath9 frequency tends to zero as @xmath10 .",
    "exchange of acoustic plasmons have been suggested as a possible mechanism of electron pairing in superconductors ( see , i.e. , ref . and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge this kind of acoustic - like modes has not been demonstrated to exist in bulk metallic systems experimentally .",
    "similar mode has been recently predicted @xcite and proved experimentally@xcite on metal surfaces . on the other hand , recent detailed _ ab initio _ calculations of the dynamical dielectric response in a variety of bulk metallic systems like mgb@xmath11,@xcite pd,@xcite transition - metal dichalcogenides,@xcite and cac@xmath12@xcite predicted , with some initial controversy,@xcite the existence of a such kind of acoustic plasmons in metallic systems .",
    "in particular , in the case of pd and cac@xmath12 this acoustic - like mode disperses in all three symmetry directions while in the layered compounds mgb@xmath11 and nbse@xmath11 the corresponding mode exists only for the momentum transfers along the direction perpendicular to the basal planes .",
    "the main aim of the present study is twofold .",
    "first , the complexity of the low - energy electronic response of bulk pb is demonstrated , together with the role of different physical ingredients .",
    "second , the results on the modes characterized by an acoustic - like dispersion are presented and analyzed in detail . in particular",
    "we demonstrate strongly anisotropic character of such low - energy collective excitations in bulk lead .",
    "the calculations of the low - energy collective excitations have been done using the first - principles pseudopotential approach within the time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft).@xcite    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii the details of the _ ab initio _ calculations of the dynamical dielectric response of 3d solids are presented . in sec .",
    "iii the general results for bulk pb for the low - energy regime are presented together with comparison with experimental optical data , while in sec .",

    "[ bs ] ) and the @xmath53 states above the fermi level .",
    "the strong increase of intensity of the interband peak at @xmath671.65 ev in the calculated loss function with the so coupling included can be explained by the fact that , as seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ optics ] , the real part of the dielectric function reaches zero at a close energy due to a sharp increase in the corresponding imaginary part of the dielectric function .",
    "it seems in our calculations this effect is more pronounced than in the calculation of glantsching and ambrosch - draxl.@xcite nevertheless , the evaluated loss functions in both calculations are rather similar in this energy range .",
    "only little differences can be observed at larger energies , where the loss function calculated in ref .",
    "is slightly larger than that evaluated in the present work .",
    "this is explained by the larger imaginary part of the dielectric function in our calculation in the 1.7 - 2.7 ev energy region and the lower real part at energies above 2 ev . from this analysis",
    "we can conclude that the experimental optical data reflect clear so effects .",
    "note that in the experimental data of ref .",
    "the two first lowest energy peaks are barely visible in the room temperature loss spectra and significantly more pronounced in the measurements performed at t=140 k. this is in agreement with the fact that pb presents a strong electron - phonon coupling , which modifies the one - electron energy levels with increasing temperature .",
    "hence , one can expect that in measurements performed at even lower temperatures , the first interband peak might increase its intensity and downshift in energy , in such a way improving agreement with the calculations .    on the other hand , comparison of the calculated results with the recently measured data obtained by reflection electron energy - loss spectroscopy ( reels)@xcite reveals only a broad weak peak around 2 ev and presents significant underestimation in intensity of the whole spectrum .",
    "these might be a consequence that this reels experiment setup might have insufficient resolution in this low - energy range , being apparently more suitable at higher energies.@xcite    in figs .  [ dir_100]-[dir_111 ]",
    "one can see how the peaks in the loss function strongly disperse upward upon increase of momentum transfer values in all three directions .",

    ", the 1.65 ev possesses along the @xmath0-l direction much less dispersion and quickly disappears at @xmath72 ev .",
    "the other weaker 2.35 ev and 3.7 ev peaks disperse upward in @xmath0-x and @xmath0-k up to energies above 6 ev where they enter the manifold corresponding to @xmath73 interband transitions and can be resolved as separate features up to @xmath74 ev . on the contrary , along @xmath0-l these upper - energy peaks disperse up to energy of @xmath75 ev where they merge each other and a much stronger peak continues dispersion up to energies about 6.3 ev . starting from @xmath76 a.u .",
    "the dispersion of this peak turns from positive to negative and it can be clearly resolved up to @xmath77 a.u .    below",
    "we present a systematic analysis of the effect of the main physical ingredients like lfes , so coupling , and xc effects on the low - energy electronic collective excitations in bulk pb .      from comparison of the upper and lower panels in figs .",
