    "nuclear symmetry energy , a part of the equation of state ( eos ) in the nuclear matter equation , has been extensively studied in the last three decades .",
    "the symmetry energy relates to many subjects such as in nuclear astrophysics , nuclear structure , and nuclear reactions .",
    "its property determination is a key objective in laboratory experiments  @xcite .",
    "investigations of the symmetry energy , especially focusing on its density dependence , have been conducted using many observables such as isotopic yield ratios  @xcite , isospin diffusion  @xcite , neutron - proton emission ratios  @xcite , giant monopole resonances  @xcite , pygmy dipole resonances  @xcite , giant dipole resonances  @xcite , collective flows  @xcite and isoscaling  @xcite .",
    "different observables may probe the properties of the symmetry energy at different densities and temperatures .    in a theoretical work of the eos study , wiringa et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the density dependence of the symmetry energy may have different slope parameters in different higher density regions .",
    "when a three body interaction is taken into account , the symmetry energy shows a significant softening at @xmath6 , hardening again at @xmath7 and then shows an asymptotic soft trend for the higher density .",
    "therefore it is important to know not only the values of the symmetry energy and slope parameter or the exponent of the density dependent terms , but also the density and temperature of the system when the values are evaluated .    in one of our previous works , the density dependence of the symmetry energy at low densities",
    "were experimentally studied in several heavy ion reactions at 47 mev / nucleon , using the light particles ( @xmath8 ) from the intermediate velocity source as the probe  @xcite . in that study the temperature in the region 5@xmath910 mev",
    "was evaluated from the double ratio thermometer and the density of @xmath10 was extracted from the coalescence technique . in the sampled density and temperature intervals ,",
    "symmetry energies were derived and nonzero symmetry energies were obtained at low densities . however in the quasiparticle approaches , such as skyrme hartree - fock and relativistic mean field models or dirac - brueckner hartree - fock calculations , the symmetry energy tends to zero at low densities  @xcite .",
    "this significant experimentally observed symmetry energy deviation at low densities from those of the quasiparticle predictions can be attributed to the cluster formation which dominates the structure of low - density symmetric matter at low temperatures , in accordance with the mass action law .    in violent heavy ion collisions at intermediate energy regime ( 20",
    "@xmath11 a few hundred mev / nucleon ) , intermediate mass fragments ( imfs ) are copiously produced through multifragmentation processes .",
    "nuclear multifragmentation , which in general , can be divided into stages , i.e. , the dynamical compression and expansion of the fragmenting source , and the formation of primary hot fragments , was predicted a long time ago  @xcite and has been studied extensively following the advent of 4@xmath12 detectors  @xcite .",
    "nuclear multifragmentation occurs when a large amount of energy is deposited in a finite nucleus , and thus it provides important information on the properties of the hot nuclear matter equation of state .    to model the multifragmentation process ,",
    "a number of different models have been developed in two distinct scenarios .",
    "one is based on a transport model , in which nucleon propagation in a mean field and nucleon - nucleon collisions under pauli - blocking are two main physical ingredients .",
    "various transport models have been coded , since boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) model  @xcite was first proposed in 1980s , which is a test particle based monte carlo transport model .",
    "vlasov - uehling - uhlenbeck model ( vuu )  @xcite , boltzmann - nordheim - vlasov model ( bnv )  @xcite are formulated slightly differently with the same concept .",
    "stochastic mean field ( smf ) model  @xcite is also a test particle based model , but with fluctuations in multifragmentation process . instead of using the test particles ,",
    "gaussian wave packets are introduced in describing the nucleons such as quantum molecular dynamics model ( qmd )  @xcite . constrained molecular dynamics(comd )",
    "model  @xcite and improved quantum molecular dynamics model ( imqmd )  @xcite are based on qmd , but an improved treatment is made on the pauli blocking during the time evolution of the reaction .",
    "fermionic molecular dynamics(fmd )  @xcite and anti - symmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd )  @xcite are most sophisticated models , in which the pauli principle is taken into account in an exact manner in the time evolution of the wave packet and nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "most of them can account reasonably well for many characteristic properties experimentally observed . on the other hand statistical multifragmentation models such as microcanonical metropolitan monte carlo model ( mmmc )  @xcite and statistical multifragmentation model(smm )  @xcite , based on a quite different assumption from the transport models , can also describe many experimental observables well .",
    "the statistical models use a freeze - out concept .",
    "the multifragmentation is assumed to take place in equilibrated nuclear matter described by parameters , such as size , neutron / proton ratio , density and temperature . in recent analyses",
    "the parameters are optimized to reproduce the experimental observables of the final state .",
    "in contrast , the transport models do not assume any chemical or thermal equilibration .",
    "nucleons travel in a mean field experiencing nucleon - nucleon collisions subject to the pauli principle .",
    "fragmentation mechanisms are determined by the evolutions of the wave pockets or nucleons in the phase space , which also differ from those of the statistical models .",
    "one of the complications one has to face when comparing the experimental observables to the model predictions in either dynamical or statistical models , is the secondary decay process .",
    "when fragments are formed in a multifragmentation process , many of them can be in excited states and cool down by evaporation processes before they are detected experimentally  @xcite . here",
    "the fragments at the time of formation are called `` primary '' fragments .",
    "those observed after the cooling process are called the `` secondary '' or `` final '' fragments .",
    "multifragmentation process is a very fast process which occurs in an order of 50 - 100 fm / c in the intermediate energy heavy ion collisions , whereas the secondary decay process is much slower .",
    "therefore the secondary cooling process may significantly alter the fragment yield distributions of the primary isotopes  @xcite .",
    "even though the statistical decay process itself is rather well understood and well coded , it is not a trivial task to combine it with a dynamical code .",
    "that is because the statistical evaporation codes assume the nuclei at thermal equilibrium with normal nuclear density and shapes .",
    "however these conditions are not guaranteed for fragments when they are formed in the multifragmentation process .    in order to avoid this complication and make the comparisons between results from the experimental data and different models more straight forward ,",
    "we proposed a method in which the primary hot fragment yields are reconstructed experimentally .",
    "the method utilizes a kinematic focusing of the evaporated particles along the precursors of imfs . in fermi energy heavy ion collisions , light particles are emitted at different stages of the reaction and from different sources during the evolution of the collisions .",
    "those from an excited isotope are kinematically focused into a cone centered along the isotope direction .",
    "the kinematical focusing technique uses this nature .",
    "details of the experiment , the kinematical focusing technique and the results are presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in that work ,",
    "the events triggered by imfs in the experiment are `` inclusive '' , but they belong to a certain class of events . in order to determine the event class taken in the experiment ,",
    "amd simulations are used to evaluate the impact parameter range sampled .",
    "firstly the impact parameter distributions , corresponding violent , semi - violent , semi - peripheral and peripheral collisions are calculated .",
    "the violence of the reaction for each event in the amd simulation is determined in the same way as our previous work  @xcite .",
    "then the impact parameter distribution of the events triggered by the imfs at @xmath13 is calculated and compared to those corresponding to the different violence .",
    "the distribution is very similar to those of the semi - violent collisions , in which the majority of the events originates from the impact parameter range of @xmath14 fm .",
    "therefore in the following analyses , the comparisons of the extracted parameters from the experimentally reconstructed isotope yields are made with those of the amd simulations in the impact parameter range of @xmath14 fm . in fig .",
    "[ fig : isotopic_distribution ] .",
    "the results of the multiplicity distributions of the experimental cold and reconstructed hot isotopes are shown , together with those of the primary isotopes simulated by the amd calculations .",
    "the reconstructed isotope multiplicities are reasonably well reproduced by the primary isotope distribution of the amd simulation . in refs .",
    "@xcite , we studied the properties of the fragmenting system through the symmetry energy coefficient relative to the temperature , @xmath2 . in the study",
    "the @xmath2 values were extracted in a simpler formalism , utilizing three isobars of the reconstructed primary hot fragments with @xmath15 and 3 .",
    "this article presents an improved method to calculate the @xmath2 values , in which the mass dependence of the temperature is taken into account as an apparent temperature .",
    "this method has been applied recently to the simulated amd events of the very central collisions for @xmath16 at 35 mev / nucleon  @xcite . a self - consistent determination of density , symmetry energy and temperature described in refs .",
    "@xcite was also employed there . in this work the same procedure following ref .",

    "if one assumes a constant pressure at the equilibrium process  @xcite , the therm `` symmetry enthalpy '' should be used .",
