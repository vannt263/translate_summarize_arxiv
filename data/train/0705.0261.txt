    "one of the basic problems of many body physics is to use analytical and numerical tools to find the ground state of a many - body system governed by a given hamiltonian .",
    "unfortunately , except for a few exactly solvable examples , the task of finding the exact ground state of a given hamiltonian is notoriously difficult . moreover in some cases also like the anti - ferromagnetic heisenberg chain , although the ground state is known , its structure turns out to be quite complicated , making the calculation of correlation functions very difficult .",
    "+ in dealing with difficult problems , one way round the difficulty is to investigate the inverse problem , that is to start from states with pre - determined properties and find the family of hamiltonians for which such a state is an exact ground state . the suitable formalism for following this path is the matrix product formalism , which was first realized in the work of @xcite , then formalized in finitely correlated states @xcite , also known as optimal @xcite or matrix product states .",
    "this formalism has been followed in recent years both constructing various models of interacting spins on chains , @xcite , ladders @xcite and some two dimensional lattices @xcite . + it has also been studied to gain a better understanding of many phenomena in correlated systems , i.e. quantum phase transitions @xcite , renormalization group algorithms @xcite , and entanglement @xcite .",
    "+ of particular interest to us in this paper is the so called majumdar - ghosh model defined on a ring of @xmath1 sites by the following hamiltonian @xmath2 which has been introduced and solved exactly in a series of papers long ago @xcite , before the advent of the matrix product formalism , and later found to have a matrix product representation @xcite .",
    "it was shown in the original papers that the ground state of this system is doubly degenerate , and each of these states has a very simple structure , that is , it is a product of singlets on adjacent sites .",
    "let us call these ground states @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and denote a singlet state on two adjacent sites by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the up and down spin in the @xmath8 direction , i.e. @xmath9 . then the degenerate ground states of ( [ h0 ] ) are : @xmath10 .",
    "from these two states , one can form the new states @xmath11 on the ring , i.e. @xmath12 , are defined as : @xmath13 these were calculated in thermodynamic limit ( @xmath14 ) in @xcite and were found to be @xmath15 since then many works have been done on different aspects of this model@xcite , including studies of spontaneous dimereization , excitation spectrum @xcite and renormalization group study @xcite of this or very closely related models ( i.e. models with anisotropy ) . it has also been shown @xcite that the majumdar - ghosh model is the first member of a discrete series of models , all having exact dimer ground states , where exchange coupling decreases linearly with the separation of spins , and vanishes beyond a certain range , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 for the majumdar - ghosh model ) .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to study the majumdar ghosh model in the context of matrix product formalism and in this way introduce a a multi - parameter deformations of this model and prove that its ground state is still doubly degenerate and dimerized . as is clear from ( [ h0 ] ) , the majumdar - ghosh model is rotationally invariant .",
    "what we will do in this paper is that we reduce this symmetry to rotations in the @xmath18 plane only and ask what are the hamiltonians on the chain with nearest and next - nearest neighbor interactions , which are still exactly solvable . + we will find a multi - parameter family of such exactly solvable hamiltonians and show that their ground states are doubly degenerate and of dimer type",
    ". both the hamiltonian and their ground states will reduce to those of the majumdar - ghosh model in a certain limit .",
    "we will calculate all the correlation functions not only in thermodynamic limit , but for any finite @xmath19 .",
    "our generalization of this model may shed light on some aspects of the majumdar - ghosh model and provide different proofs for some of its properties .",
    "+ moreover , since the model is less symmetric and has 5 tunable parameters , it may be more flexible for matching with real experimental situations .",
    "+ the structure of this paper is as follows : first we review briefly the matrix product formalism in section ( [ mps ] ) and then in section ( [ mg ] ) we derive the majumdar - ghosh model by using the matrix product formalism . in section ( [ deformedmg ] )",
    "we use the same formalism to construct a continuous multi - parameter family of models , and show that the original majumdar - ghosh model corresponds to a specific point in this parameter space . in various subsections of this section",
    "we make a detailed study of this model , derive its hamiltonian , determine the structure of its ground state and prove that the doubly degenerate ground states of this model have a simple structure , that is , they are products of entangled spin states on adjacent sites , in the same way that the ground states of the majumdar - ghosh model are products of singlets on adjacent sites .",
    "we also calculate all the one and the two point- functions of this model .",
    "in particular we show that each of the degenerate ground states has a non - zero staggered magnetization , however the translation - invariant ground states have zero staggered magnetization .",
    "we conclude the paper with a discussion .",
    "let us first make a quick review of the matrix product states in a language which we find convenient @xcite . for more detailed reviews of the subject",
    ", the reader can consult more comprehensive review articles @xcite .",
    "consider a ring of @xmath19 sites , where each site describes a @xmath20level state .",
    "the hilbert space of each site is spanned by the basis vectors @xmath21 .",
    "a state @xmath22 is called a matrix product state if there exist matrices @xmath23 ( of dimension @xmath24 ) , such that @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a normalization constant .",
    "this constant is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 note that we are here considering homogeneous matrix product states ( mps ) where the matrices depend on the value of the spin at each site and not on the site itself .",
    "more general mps s can be defined where the matrices depend also on the sites @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that such states can represent any quantum state on a chain @xcite .",
    "+ the collection of matrices @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is an arbitrary complex number , both lead to the same matrix product state , the freedom in scaling with @xmath31 , is due to its cancelation with @xmath26 in the denominator of ( [ mps ] )",
    ". this freedom will be useful when we discuss symmetries .",
    "+ * symmetries : * the state @xmath32 is reflection symmetric if there exists a matrix @xmath33 and a scalar @xmath34 such that @xmath35 it is invariant under spin flip transformation if there exists a matrix @xmath36 and a scalar @xmath37 , such that @xmath38 finally , it is time - reversal invariant if there exists a matrix @xmath39 , and a scalar @xmath40 such that @xmath41 in this article , we work with real matrices so that the last condition is automatically satisfied .",
    "let us now turn to continuous symmetries . + consider a local symmetry operator @xmath42 acting on a site as @xmath43 where summation convention is being used .",
    "@xmath42 is a @xmath44 dimensional unitary representation of the symmetry . a global symmetry operator @xmath45",

    "the state @xmath32 is invariant under this symmetry if there exist an operator @xmath48 and a scalar @xmath49 such that @xmath50 repeating this transformation puts the constraint @xmath51 thus @xmath48 is a @xmath24 dimensional _ projective _ representation of the symmetry @xmath42 . in case that @xmath42 is a continuous symmetry with generators @xmath52 , equation ( [ symm ] ) , leads to @xmath53+\\mu_a a_i,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath54 are the @xmath20 and @xmath55dimensional representations of the lie algebra of the symmetry , and @xmath56 are numbers . in this paper",
    "we will restrict our study to the case of @xmath57 .",
    "equations ( [ symm ] ) and ( [ symmalg ] ) will be our guiding lines in defining states with prescribed symmetries . + * the hamiltonian : * given a matrix product state , the reduced density matrix of one site is given by @xmath58 this density matrix has at least @xmath59 zero eigenvalues . to see this ,",
    "suppose that we can find complex numbers @xmath60 such that @xmath61 this is a system of @xmath62 equations for @xmath44 unknowns which has at least @xmath59 independent solutions .",
    "any solution @xmath63 gives a null eigenvector of @xmath64 .",
    "thus the null space of the reduced density matrix of one site comprises a subspace of at least @xmath59 dimension , spanned by the independent solutions of equation ( [ ca ] ) .",
    "+ the same reasoning applies to reduced density matrices of @xmath65 consecutive sites which are given by @xmath66 in this case the null space of the reduced density matrix of @xmath65 sites is spanned by the solutions of @xmath67 the number of independent solutions of this system of equation is now @xmath68 .",
    "thus for the density matrix of @xmath65 sites to have a null space it is sufficient ( but not necessary and this is a crucial point ) that the following inequality holds @xmath69 let the null space of the reduced density matrix be spanned by the orthogonal vectors @xmath70 .",
    "then we can construct the local hamiltonian acting on @xmath65 consecutive sites as @xmath71 where @xmath72 s are positive constants .",
    "these constants together with the parameters of the vectors @xmath73 inherited from those of the original matrices @xmath74 , determine the total number of coupling constants of the hamiltonian .",
    "if we call the embedding of this local hamiltonian into the sites @xmath75 to @xmath76 by @xmath77 then the full hamiltonian on the chain is written as @xmath78 the state @xmath32 is then a ground state of this hamiltonian with vanishing energy .",
    "the reason is as follows : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the reduced density matrix of sites @xmath75 to @xmath76 and in the last line we have used the fact that @xmath81 is constructed from the null eigenvectors of @xmath82 for @xmath65 consecutive sites . given that @xmath83 is a positive operator , this proves the assertion . +",
    "* correlation functions : * let @xmath84 be any local operator acting on a single site . then we can obtain the one point function on site @xmath65 of the chain @xmath85 as follows : @xmath86 where @xmath87 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath14 , equation ( [ 1pointmps ] ) gives @xmath88 where we have used the translation invariance of the model and @xmath89 is the eigenvalue of @xmath90 with the largest absolute value , for which the matrix element is non - vanishing , and @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the right and left eigenvectors corresponding to this eigenvalue , normalized such that @xmath93 . here",
    "we are assuming that the largest eigenvalue of @xmath90 is non - degenerate .",
    "+ the n - point functions can be obtained in a similar way .",
    "for example , the two - point function @xmath94 can be obtained as @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "note that this is a formal notation which allows us to write the n - point functions in a uniform way , it does not require that @xmath90 is an invertible matrix . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the two point function turns out to be @xmath97",
    "we take the size of the ring an even number @xmath1 .",
    "let us also choose @xmath98 ( spin @xmath99 particles ) , @xmath100 ( interactions up to next - nearest neighbors ) and work with @xmath101 dimensional matrices .",
    "note that the condition @xmath102 is not satisfied here , but in view of the fact that this is a sufficient and not necessary condition , this will not be a source of concern .",
    "the basic symmetry that we demand is the rotational symmetry around the @xmath8 axis , which according to ( [ symmalg ] ) demands that there be a matrix @xmath103 such that @xmath104=\\frac{1}{2}a_0,\\h [ a_1,s_z]=-\\frac{1}{2}a_1.\\ ] ] working in a basis where @xmath105 , these equations immediately show that @xmath106 and @xmath107 should be of the following form : @xmath108 by a similarity transformation @xmath109 where @xmath110 , the parameters of the matrix @xmath106 are both set equal to @xmath111 , ( the parameters of @xmath107 change which we again denote them by @xmath112 and @xmath81 . ) at this stage no similarity transformation or re - scaling , can reduce the number of parameters , however we note that the matrices @xmath106 and @xmath107 act as raising and lowering operators on the 3 dimensional space they act on , ( @xmath113 ) and hence the trace of any string of operators @xmath114 is non - zero only if the number of @xmath106 and @xmath107 operators are equal in such a string .",
    "this implies first that any such string should be of even length ( that is why we have taken a ring of even length ) , and second that a factor of @xmath115 will be removed from the numerator and denominator of ( [ mps ] ) due to the normalization of the state .",
    "thus the final matrices which will make a matrix product state with @xmath103 symmetry , will be of the form : @xmath116 this is all we can go with @xmath103 symmetry and we will in fact make a detailed study of such models in the next section . + what happens if we impose the discrete spin - flip symmetry on the state ?",
    "this demands that there be a matrix @xmath36 and a scalar @xmath37 such that @xmath117 a short calculation shows that the matrix @xmath36 which satisfies the above equation is equal to @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "thus spin - flip symmetry requires that the parameter @xmath112 be a discrete parameter which we rename as @xmath120 , where @xmath121 .",
    "+ it is now found that the parity symmetry imposes no new condition on the parameters , since with the following matrix @xmath122 one can verify that @xmath123 therefore the final form of the matrices leading to a model with a continuous @xmath103 symmetry plus two discrete parity and spin flip symmetries will be of the form : @xmath124    how is the matrix product state ( [ mps ] ) with the above matrices is related to the states @xmath125 ?",
    "we will show in the next section , when we study the generalization of this model , that the matrix product state is equal to @xmath126 , that is it is the linear superposition of the ground states which is invariant under translation ( with eigenvalue 1 ) .",
    "in fact it has been shown that both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are ground states and so translation invariant combinations of them , namely @xmath127 , are also ground states .",
    "the point is that only @xmath128 has a matrix product representation .",
    "it sometimes happens that from a single matrix product state , one can derive the degenerate grounds states of a model not all of which have matrix product representations .",
    "the majumdar - ghosh model is one such case .",
    "+ let us also find the hamiltonian . with the matrices ( [ matricesszspinflipparity ] ) we should solve the equations @xmath129",
    "it is readily found that the solution space of this system is spanned by the following four vectors : @xmath130 these vectors are parity invariant ( invariant under left - right reflection ) and are mapped to each other under spin - flip transformation ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "a hamiltonian with all three symmetries is constructed as : @xmath132 which when expanded in terms of the spin operators , and embedded into the chain , makes the total hamiltonian equal to the following : @xmath133 for @xmath134 this reduces to @xmath135 and for @xmath136 reduces to @xmath137 it is the hamiltonian @xmath138 which turns into the already familiar majumdar - ghosh model ( [ h0 ] ) , by taking @xmath139 . for general values of @xmath140 and",
    "@xmath141 it describes the anisotropic majumdar - ghosh model , where the anisotropy parameter @xmath142 is the same for both the nearest and next - nearest neighbors .",
    "+ we do not know whether this is already well - known that this model is also exactly solvable .",
    "in fact one can check directly that the eigenstates ( [ phi1phi2 ] ) are also eigenstates of the operator @xmath143 with eigenvalue @xmath1 . to see this one needs to invoke the following relations which hold true for any two consecutive singlets @xmath144 and @xmath145 : @xmath146 where @xmath147 .    using these relations",
    "one sees that in @xmath148 all the terms containing the @xmath149 terms cancel out and one is left with @xmath150 .    putting all these together we find @xmath151    what is the hamiltonian @xmath152 ?",
    "does it represent any new model ?",
    "the answer is negative . to see this we note that by rotating the even - numbered spins around the @xmath8 axis by an angle of @xmath153 , under which @xmath154 and @xmath155 , while keeping the odd - numbered spins intact , the hamiltonian @xmath152 is mapped onto @xmath138 .",
    "+ this transformation will map the states @xmath125 onto the states @xmath156 where    latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\nonumber |\\chi_1\\ra & = & u_{1,2}u_{3,4}\\ \\cdots \\",
    "u_{2n-1,2n } , \\cr     these states are the doubly degenerate ground states of @xmath152 .",
    "in the last section we have shown how the majumdar - ghosh hamiltonian and its ground states are derived in the matrix product formalism .",
    "let us now relax the condition of parity symmetry , which automatically removes also the spin flip symmetry .",
    "then the matrices will be of the form ( [ matricesszscaling ] ) , which still have the continuous symmetry of rotation around the @xmath8 axis .",
    "it is now easily verified that the solution space of the system of equations ( [ caa ] ) with @xmath100 is spanned by the following four vectors : @xmath158 the most general local hamiltonian having the matrix product state as its ground state is now given by @xmath159 rewriting this in terms of spin operators we find after some rather lengthy calculations the following form of the final hamiltonian @xmath160 where the couplings are @xmath161 this is a 5-parameter family of models with nearest neighbor and next - nearest neighbor interactions , whose ground state can be written down exactly .",
    "we will show that with the couplings as above , this model has a doubly degenerate ground state , each of which has a simple product structure of dimers , like the one given in ( [ phi1phi2 ] ) . + note that the hamiltonian ( [ hdeformed ] ) will reduce to @xmath138 when we restrict the parameters as follows @xmath162 and to ( [ h0 ] ) when we further set @xmath139 .",
    "+      the matrix product state ( [ matricesszscaling ] ) has a simple structure .",
    "we prove the following theorem : + * theorem : * the matrix product state ( [ mps ] ) constructed from the matrices ( [ matricesszscaling ] ) which is a ground state of ( [ hdeformed ] ) has the following structure .",
    "define a state    @xmath163 @xmath164 that is @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the translation operator along the chain by one lattice unit .",
    "then we have @xmath167    * proof : * consider the matrix product state @xmath168 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath169 are non - vanishing only when + i ) the number of @xmath170 indices and @xmath111 indices are equal ( in view of the fact that the matrices @xmath106 and @xmath107 are raising and lowering operators ) , ii ) no three consecutive indices are @xmath170 or @xmath111 , ( since @xmath171 ) , and iii ) no substrings of the types @xmath172 or @xmath173 appear in the indices , ( since @xmath174 . )",
    "+ let us define the compact notations @xmath175 and @xmath176 . in view of the above three properties , we can divide the set of states @xmath177 into two types , type 1 , which are states of the form @xmath178 , that is , strings of @xmath179 s and @xmath180,s in arbitrary order , and type 2 , which are transformed to the above type by a one - unit cyclic translation like @xmath181 .",
    "there is a one to one correspondence between these two types of states and hence the state @xmath32 can be divided in two parts , depending on the type of basis states  @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "we now note that @xmath184 this means that @xmath185 and @xmath186 commute with each other , which immediately implies that @xmath187 is a product state , i.e. @xmath188 where @xmath189 denotes a uniform superposition of states each of which has @xmath190 @xmath191 and @xmath192 @xmath180 s , in different positions .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "+ are the two individual states @xmath187 and @xmath193 the ground states of @xmath83 ? there are supports for thinking so .",
    "first we have checked this for low values of system size @xmath19 and second we know that as @xmath194 , these states approach the states of majumdar - ghosh ( [ phi1phi2 ] ) which are known to be ground states of the hamiltonian @xmath138 .",
    "therefore we can make two linear combinations of these ground states , namely @xmath195 which does not have such a representation . in the next subsection",
    "we calculate the correlation functions on these translation invariant states and they again approach the ones calculated in @xcite in the limit @xmath196 and @xmath14 . for our future reference",
    "we need the following easily verified properties : @xmath197      in the majumdar - ghosh model both the ground states ( [ phi1phi2 ] ) have anti - ferromagnetic order and @xmath198 .",
    "this is clear from the fact that the states ( [ phi1phi2 ] ) are product of singlets on adjacent sites . in our model , the states are no longer singlets and while there is no magnetic order present , the staggered magnetization is non - vanishing . consider the states @xmath187 , and @xmath193",
    "in view of their simple product structure , it is readily seen that    @xmath199    and @xmath200 this means that the value of staggered magnetization defined as @xmath201    however there is no staggered magnetization in the translation invariant states @xmath202 . to see this",
    "we can calculate @xmath203 for the state @xmath204 , either by using the matrix product formula ( [ 1pointmps ] ) or by a direct calculation in which we use ( [ szphi1 ] ) , ( [ szphi2 ] ) and    @xmath205    in which @xmath84 is any operator and we have abbreviated @xmath206 to @xmath207 and used the fact that @xmath208 to simplify terms in the denominator . for this direct calculation ,",
    "the only new quantity which is needed is @xmath209 .",
    "we know that all the states in the expansion of @xmath187 and @xmath193 are different from each other except the states @xmath210 and @xmath211 which are common to both and transformed into each other by the action of the translation operator @xmath166 .",
    "so we find @xmath212 implying that there is no staggered magnetization in @xmath202 .",
    "the two point functions can also be calculated along similar lines .",
    "we point out only the general method .",
    "the product nature of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , formula ( [ correlationspsi ] ) and the reasoning used above for the calculation of the cross term @xmath213 facilitate calculations of @xmath214 .",
    "however the cross term @xmath215 is hard to calculate in this way .",
    "instead we calculate @xmath216 ( i.e. for the matrix product state @xmath128 ) from ( [ 2pointmps ] ) and infer the cross term from its result .",
    "we then use this cross term for determining the correlation @xmath217 .",
    "the reader can verify these results by direct calculation for chains of small size .",
    "the interesting point is that all the correlation functions can be expressed in terms of a variable @xmath218 which is invariant under the interchange of @xmath219 .",
    "the results are : @xmath220    and @xmath221 it can be verified that these correlation functions reduce to ( [ correlationsgm ] ) at the point @xmath196 ( @xmath222 ) , after we take the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we have constructed a 5-parameter family of spin - hamiltonians with nearest and next nearest neighbor interactions and have found their exact ground states .",
    "the ground states , depend on only one of these parameters , are doubly degenerate and have a very simple structure .",
    "they are product of entangled states ( dimers ) on adjacent spins .",
    "we have also calculated the one and the two point functions in closed analytic form both for finite size of the chain and in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the dimerized ground states show staggered magnetization , but the translation - invariant combinations of these states have no staggered magnetization .",

    "<S> , the doubly degenerate ground states of our models have a very simple structure , they are the product of entangled ( dimer ) states on adjacent sites . in each of these states </S>",
    "<S> there is a non - zero staggered magnetization , which vanishes when we take their translation - invariant combination as the new ground states . at the majumdar - ghosh point , these entangled states become the spin - singlets pertaining to this model . </S>",
    "<S> we will also calculate in closed form the two point correlation functions , both for finite size of the chain and in the thermodynamic limit .    </S>",
