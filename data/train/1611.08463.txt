    "the knowledge about the behaviour of the tunneling expectation value @xmath57 is required to solve the self - consistency condition and in particular in order to determine whether the continuous onset of the occupation of the cavity field is present at this filling .",
    "the filling @xmath85 is particular , since at this filling for @xmath7 the fermi energy lies at the crossing point of different energy bands and the splitting of these bands generate a logarithmic increase of the tunneling at small values of @xmath60 .    in order to determine the main contribution of the bulk of the system to the tunneling expectation value @xmath57",

    "one sees that always @xmath69 states are coupled . for @xmath110 , for example , the hamiltonian is given by @xmath111 where we shifted the momentum along @xmath4-direction by @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "for @xmath114 , the energy of the first two eigenstates is degenerate at @xmath115 ( for the considered shift ) and the fermi level at filling @xmath116 lies at this energy .        where @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath123 , @xmath124 and the eigenvectors are @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 up to the first order of magnitude in @xmath128 .",
    "if only the lowest band is filled ( which corresponds to @xmath116 ) the directed tunneling is @xmath129 .      where @xmath131 .",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath132 and @xmath124 .",
    "the eigenvectors are @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 . for this regime",
    "the directed tunneling is calculated as @xmath136 which can be very large for very small momentum @xmath137 .",
    "the directed tunneling in case ( iii ) is very small compared to the other cases . the same result is calculated for @xmath138 .    integrating the total directed tunneling over the brillouin zone by dividing it into the three cases , results in a logarithmic behaviour of the tunneling along @xmath0-direction @xmath139 at small tunneling .",
    "we verified numerically that this behavior persists in the evaluation of integrals .",
    "similar arguments can be repeated for different values of @xmath69 , where subblocks of the matrices have a similar structure as the one discussed for @xmath110 .",
    "additionally , the behaviour of the edge states can be analyzed and leads to the same logarithmic dependence of the rung tunneling on the tunneling amplitudes .",
    "we tested numerically that up to large values of @xmath69 , the described behaviour can be found both in the bulk and edge states .",
    "the consequence is that at filling @xmath85 an infinitesimally small pump strength is enough to stabilize the finite occupation of the cavity mode .",
