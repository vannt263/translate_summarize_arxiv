    "the compounds tiox , with x = cl and br are formed by layers of distorted @xmath0 octahedra . quantum magnetism in these systems is based on the @xmath1 ions with one electron ( @xmath2 , s=1/2 ) in a @xmath3 state .",
    "the distortion of the octahedra leads to the predominant occupation of @xmath4 orbitals that form chain - like direct exchange paths of orbitals along the crystallographic _ b _ axis of the compound . in several experiments , as magnetic susceptibility @xcite , nmr @xcite , esr @xcite , x - ray scattering @xcite , raman scattering and optical spectroscopy @xcite , strong fluctuations and multiple transitions",
    "are observed that are attributed to this spin / orbital system with low dimensionality .",
    "so far , with the exception of one ir investigation @xcite , only the system tiocl has been investigated thoroughly .",
    "the isostructural tiobr has not been in the center of interest due to more severe problems in growing single crystalline samples of sufficient quality .",
    "the scaling of the ir active phonon frequencies with the involved ionic masses , however , proposes tiobr as a perfect reference system .",
    "the compounds differ crystallographically by an increase of the _ c _ axis lattice parameter from 8.03 to 8.53@xmath5 , going from x = cl to br .",
    "this means that in tiobr the coupling between the planes of octahedra is even less important compared to tiocl .",
    "furthermore , the distortion of the octahedra is larger in tiobr .",
    "the compounds tiox belong to a new class of spin-1/2 transition metal oxides based on @xmath1 ions in weakly interconnected , distorted octahedral coordinations @xcite .",
    "very often these systems show phase transitions into singlet ground states that resemble to the spin - peierls instability @xcite .",
    "in contrast to , e.g. @xmath6 @xcite where the spin - peierls transition leads to a mean - field size of the reduced gap ratio , very large spin gaps exist in some titanates @xcite . for tiocl",
    "even a pseudo gap for t@xmath7@xmath8 has been reported based on nmr and raman scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "as @xmath3 states of the @xmath1 ions ( @xmath2 , s=1/2 ) in perfect octahedral surrounding show orbital degeneracy , it is tempting to assign part of these phenomena to orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "spin - orbital coupled systems have been investigated theoretically with respect to their instabilities @xcite and as they are candidates for exotic electronic configurations @xcite .",
    "these theoretical scenarios did not explicitly consider static or dynamic phonon degrees of freedom . for 2d systems with low symmetry exchange paths",
    "it is known that phonons stabilize spin liquids and shift phase lines @xcite .",
    "furthermore , orbital configurations strongly couple to the lattice@xcite .",
    "therefore , changes of lattice parameters are expected to affect the magnetic properties and related instabilities of such systems considerably .    in this article",
    "we present a comparative study of tiocl and tiobr using magnetic susceptibility , raman scattering and band structure calculations to relate structural and electronic properties of these systems and to achieve a better understanding of the observed instabilities .",
    "it is shown , that the fluctuation regime in tiobr is even more extended compared to tiocl .",
    "the layered crystal structure of tiox is formed by @xmath9 bilayers , that are separated by @xmath10 bilayers .",
    "the basic @xmath11 units are distorted octahedra that share edges .",
    "these units form double layers in the _ ab _ plane of an orthorhombic unit cell with feocl - type structure @xcite . in fig .  1  ( a ) a sketch of octahedra within two rows of the double layer is shown . in fig .  1  ( b )",
    ", ( c ) local ti - o - x coordinations are given in the _ bc _ and the _ ab _ plane , respectively .",
    "important structural parameters and atomic distances can be found in table  i to highlight common and emphasize differences induced by substituting cl and br ions .",
    "it is evident that the substitution leads to a considerable increase of the volume of the unit cell .",
    "this effect divides up into an enhanced separation of the layers and to a smaller extend to an elongation of the cell in _",
    "b _ axis direction .",
    "the octahedra distortion is more pronounced in tiobr .",
    "this is demonstrated in table  i by comparing the shift of the ti ion out of the basal plane of the octahedra along the _ c _ axis .",
    ".structural parameters and atomic separations for tiocl and tiobr with pmmn ( no . 59 ) .",
    "units are @xmath5 or @xmath12 .",
    "parameters are rounded for clarity and derived using refs . and .",
    "intra - layer ti - ti separations are given along the direct exchange path parallel to the _ b _ axis and from the upper to the lower ti site of one double layer .",
    "for the inter - layer ti - ti separations also two values exist due to the double layers .",
    "the distortions of the octahedra are characterized by @xmath13c@xmath14 , corresponding to the _ c _ axis shift of the ti ion out of its basal plane .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a rough estimate of the antiferromagnetic superexchange along @xmath15 can be obtained by using the expression @xmath16 which for @xmath17=3.3ev is j @xmath18 621  k for tiocl and j @xmath18 406  k for tiobr .",
    "this change is larger than the shift seen in high energy raman spectra and in qualitative agreement with the susceptibility measurements .",
    "since we are here interested in estimating the differences between tiocl and tiobr , we present in table [ parameters ] a detailed account of all relevant effective hopping parameters between ti-@xmath4-ti-@xmath4 .",
    "we observe that the hopping integrals along other paths than @xmath19 are almost an order of magnitude smaller than the main hopping along @xmath15 , nevertheless the tiobr compound has slightly larger effective hoppings along the @xmath20 plane than tiocl what indicates that in that system the interactions within the @xmath20 plane may be more significant than in tiocl .",
    "the comparison ( table  ii ) shows that this result is only in qualitative agreement with the trend seen in maximum of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the system tiox , with x = cl and br , shows a rich spectrum of anomalies related to electronic , spin and structural degrees of freedom that goes far beyond the scenario of usual spin - peierls materials @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the magnetic susceptibility and phase diagram shows that the low temperature transition , @xmath21 , connected with a commensurate structural distortion , scales with the decrease of the susceptibility and the evolution of the spin gap .",
    "the high temperature transition , @xmath22 , scales with the maximum in the susceptibility that is itself related to the characteristic energy scale of the magnetic system .",
    "the deviations between the latter energy scale and the high energy raman scattering are either due to a complex structure of the dimer formation or due to an interplay with the phonon sector .",
    "due to the strong distortion and the already weak interlayer coupling in tiocl we do not expect that changes of the dimensionality play an essential role .",
    "finally , our band structure calculations have shown that , although the effective ti-@xmath23-ti-@xmath4 hopping parameters are renormalized with the substitution of cl by br , the electronic spectrum does not change drastically .",
    "this is in accordance with the high energy raman scattering . following the cross - fisher scaling , the difference in the transition temperatures of the two compounds",
    "should then be attributed both to the smaller electronic bandwidth and a modified spin - phonon coupling .",
    "this scenario , however , does neither explain the strong fluctuations nor the large spin gap observed even above the transition temperatures .",
    "further studies on both systems are needed to elucidate these points .",
    "the authors acknowledge fruitful discussions with c. gros , h. rosner , l. degiorgi , e.  ya .",
