    "it is very well established that the variations of some of the oscillation mode parameters is a signature of the solar activity cycle .",
    "for instance , the acoustic mode frequency is shifted positively of 0.4@xmath0hz from minimum to maximum of the solar cycle ( libbrecht and woodard 1990 , rgulo et al .",
    "1994 , jimnez - reyes et al .",
    "it has also been noted that , this variation depends on the frequency and on the degree of the mode as well .",
    "the even terms of the splitting coefficients present similar changes . here , we present an analysis of the frequency shift using lowl observations .",
    "the raw data consist in full disk solar doppler images , which have been collected by lowl instrument .",
    "this experiment is based on a magneto - optical filter and has demonstrated its high sensitivity to the solar oscillations .",
    "the data were analyzed using the lowl pipeline which has recently been improved ( jimnez - reyes 2000 ) .",
    "the images are first calibrated and then a spherical harmonic decomposition is performed in order to create time series for degrees from @xmath1=0 to 99 .",
    "finally , a fast fourier transform is applied to the time series .",
    "the spherical harmonics are not orthogonal over the observed area , limited to one hemisphere . therefore , the modes can not be totally isolated and some correlations between different ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) spectra exist .",
    "historically , the statistic of the power spectra has been assumed to be as @xmath3 with 2 degrees of freedom . however , this assumption is not correct when the spectra are not independent .",
    "recently , important improvements have been achieved in the fitting techniques to be applied to observations made using instruments with spatial resolution ( schou 1992 , appourchaux et al .",
    "1998 ) . the real and the imaginary part of the fourier",
    "transform follow a multi - normal distribution which is described by a covariance matrix .",
    "the likelihood function under these assumptions can be written as : @xmath4 where @xmath5 corresponds to the fourier transform and @xmath6 is the covariance matrix calculated by : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the leakage matrix which represents the correlation between modes with different @xmath2 ( @xmath2-leakage ) , whereas @xmath9 is the noise covariance matrix which gives information about the noise correlation between spectra .",
    "@xmath10 is the variance and it is given by a simple lorentzian profile defined by the parameters @xmath11 that we are trying to infer using a maximum likelihood method .",
    "the shift between @xmath2-components is given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are orthogonal polynomials normalized such that @xmath14 ( schou et al .",
    "1994 , app .",
    "the odd @xmath15-coefficients are induced by the internal rotation while the even terms are mainly related to effects of second order due to rotation , the presence of magnetic fields or any departure from spherical symmetry .",
    "the distance between modes with the same order @xmath16 and with @xmath17=@xmath18 get closer and closer at high degrees leading to a leakage of the modes ( @xmath1-leakage ) .",
    "this problem arises at lower degree in the case of observations from just one station , due to the existence of the sidelobes as a result of the modulation of one day in the signal .",
    "that is particular important for those modes where @xmath19hz . in order to reduce the systematic errors an extra covariance matrix",
    "is added to take into account the presence of spurious modes which can be close to the target mode .",
    "nevertheless , we have seen that the systematic errors are specially important in the odd @xmath15-coefficients and not in the even ones .    at high degree , the numerical evaluation of the likelihood function get slow , mainly because of the large dimensions of the covariance matrix .",
    "therefore , we use just the main diagonal of the covariance matrix . we have checked that this is indeed a very good approximation for high degrees .",
    "]    figure  [ uno ] shows the temporal variation of the integrated frequency shift for frequencies between 2 and 3.5 mhz . for comparison ,",
    "the figure includes the same calculations using the bbso data ( squares ) .",
    "mark - i instrument has been measuring the solar oscillation for more than 20 years .",
    "this instrument observes the sun like a star , so the information is limited to low degrees ( @xmath20 ) . recently , the database has been re - analyzed ( jimnez - reyes 2000 ) over a much wider time interval than before . here",
    ", we have calculated the yearly frequency shift every six months for the last 15 years .",
    "all the results are very well correlated with the changes in the solar activity cycle denoted on fig .",
    "[ uno ] by the best linear fit between the radio flux and the results from mark - i .",
    "the amplitude of these changes are , for low degrees , close to 0.4@xmath0hz , peak - to - peak , and the correlation with the radio flux variations is close to 1 .",
    "the temporal variations of the central frequency are expected to change with both frequency and degree .",
    "earlier works ( libbrecht and woodard , 1990 ) have shown a strong variation with the frequency , the frequency shift being null at @xmath212 mhz and increasing at higher frequency .",
    "the @xmath1-dependence has been found to be more weak .    ]",
    "figure  [ dos ] shows the variation of the frequency shift averaged over @xmath1 for three selected years .",
    "the reference is the mean over the six years of data .",
    "the last minimum of the solar cycle happened in 1996 , whereas 1999 represents the year with higher level of solar activity in our database .",
    "as we can see , the frequency dependence is very clear , mainly between 1996 and 1999 .",

    "it has been averaged in the same way as the results shown in figure  [ dos ] .",
    "the solid line over the points corresponding to 1999 represents the best linear fit to inverse mode mass .",
    "the observed frequency shift exhibits almost the same frequency dependence than the inverse mode mass . however , there are still some differences which can be seen also in the analysis of the gong data ( howe et al .",
    "this may or not be significant but it is interesting to notice that both results present the same fluctuations around the inverse mode mass curve .    the @xmath1-dependence has been also calculated and plotted in figure  [ tres ] .",
    "again , we have selected the same years than in the last figure and the reference is the mean over the six years .",
    "the dependence with the degree is maximum for 1999 with a difference of about @xmath22hz between @xmath1=5 and @xmath1=99 .",
    "the inverse mode mass , averaged in the same way than the observations , is shown in the figure , scaled to the best linear fit using the results corresponding to 1999 .",
    "the solid line follows remarkably well the frequency shift .",
    "the variations of the frequency shift have been studied , assuming a linear relationship with the solar activity indices .",
    "the solar indices used here are :    * the sunspot number , r@xmath23 ; * the integrated radio flux at 10.7 cm , f@xmath24 + ( both obtained from the solar geophysical data ) ; * the kitt peak magnetic index ( kpmi ) extracted from the kitt peak full disk magnetograms ( harvey 1984 ) ; * the mount wilson index also called magnetic plage strength index , mpsi ( ulrich et al . 1991 ) ; * the equivalent width of hei 10830  averaged over the whole solar disk using data from kitt peak observatory ; * the total solar irradiance , tsi ( frhlich , c. @xmath25 lean , j. , 1998 ) .",

    "( 1999 ) from gong observations .",
    "the magnitude of these parameters are very similar although some differences remain",

    "we have analyzed six years of lowl data from 1994 to the end of 1999 in order to parameterize the variation of the frequency shift and the even @xmath15-coefficients .    in summary ,",
    "the acoustic central frequency presents a variation which is very well correlated with the solar cycle . the integrated amplitude of this variation , peak - to - peak , is close to 0.4@xmath0hz .",
    "this variation is however a function of both the frequency and the degree , and these dependences can be well fitted by the inverse mode mass .",
    "in addition , the even @xmath15-coefficients present a significant change with the solar cycle , very well correlated with the solar indices .",
    "moreover , as for the frequency shift , these changes increase with the frequency .",
    "the results agree very well with earlier studies ( libbrecht and woodard , 1990 ) carried out at the beginning of the last solar cycle .",
