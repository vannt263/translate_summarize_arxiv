    "a large number of physical systems , in particular in plasma physics , are described in terms of a variable evolving in a deterministic velocity field under the effect of a random perturbation .",
    "this is described by a stochastic differential equation of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the velocity field and the perturbation is the white noise @xmath2    this general form has been invoked in several applications .",
    "more recently , in a series of works devoted to the explanation of the intermittent behavior of the statistical characteristics of the turbulence in magnetically confined plasma it has been developed a formalism based on barrier crossing .",

    "in studying the stochastic processes the functional methods can be very useful and obtain systematic results otherwise less accessible to alternative methods .",
    "the method has been developed initially in quantum theory and it is now a basic instrument in condensed matter , field theory , statistical physics , etc . in general",
    "it is based on the formulation of the problem in terms of an action functional .",
    "there are two distinct advantages from this formulation : ( 1 ) the system s behavior appears to be determined by all classes of trajectories that extremize the action and their contributions are summed after appropriate weights are applied ; ( 2 ) the method naturally includes the contributions from states close to the extrema , so that fluctuations can be accounted for .",
    "there are technical limitations to the applicability of this method . in the statistical problems ( including barrier - type problems )",
    "it is simpler to treat cases with white noise , while colored noise can be treated perturbatively . in the latter case , the procedure is however useful since the diagrammatic series can be formulated systematically .",
    "the colored noise can be treated by extending the space of variables : the stochastic variable with finite correlation is generated by integration of a new , white noise variable .",
    "the one dimensional version can be developed up to final explicit result . since however",
    "the barrier type problem is frequently formulated in two - dimensions , one has to look for extrema of the action and ennumerate all possible trajectories .",
    "it is however known that , in these cases , the behavior of the system is dominated by a particular path , `` the optimum escape path '' , and a reasonnable approximation is to reduce the problem to a one - dimensional one along this system s trajectory .",
    "we will briefly mention the steps of constructiong the msr action functional , in the jensen path integral reformulation .",
    "we begin by choosing a particular realisation of the noise @xmath7 .",
    "all the functions and derivatives can be discretised on a lattice of points in the time interval @xmath8 $ ] ( actually one can take the limits to be @xmath9 ) .",
    "the solution of the equation ( [ eqcanoi ] ) is a `` configuration '' of the field @xmath10 which can be seen as a point in a space of functions .",
    "we extend the space of configurations @xmath3 to this space of functions , including all possible forms of @xmath10 , not necessarly solutions . in this space",
    "the solution itself will be individualised by a functional dirac @xmath11 function . @xmath12",
    "any functional of the system s real configuration ( _ i.e. _ solutions of the equations ) can be formally expressed by taking as argument an arbitrary functional variable , multiplying by this @xmath11 functional and integrating over the space of all functions .",
    "we will skip the discretization and the fourier representation of the @xmath13 functions , followed by reverting to the continuous functions .",

    "this functional integral must be determined explicitely .",
    "the standard way to proceed to the calculation of @xmath18 is to find the saddle point in the function space and then expand the action around this point to include the fluctuating trajectories .",

    "this would render the perturbative expansion extremly complicated since we would have to introduce two vertices : one , of order four , is that shown in eq.([zjnl ] ) and another , of order three , related to the first of the nonlinearities mentioned above .    even in the present case",
    ", the calculation appears very tedious .",
