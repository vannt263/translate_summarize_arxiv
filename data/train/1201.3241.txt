    "in the last few years , following the discovery of multiple sequences in the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) of many globular clusters ( gcs ) , the debate on their he content has been renewed . in this respect ,",
    "the most interesting and peculiar clusters are @xmath5 centauri and ngc  2808 , where at least 3 main sequences ( ms ) are present @xcite .",
    "the color of these sequences can not be explained in terms of a metallicity effect . in @xmath5 centauri",
    "@xcite showed that the bluest ms is more metal rich than the main red population , while in ngc  2808 they all have the same iron content ( as inferred from abundances in rgb stars ) .",
    "the only remaining parameter affecting significantly the position of a star in the ms is the helium content , and this was the explanation proposed for the photometric and spectroscopic properties of the ms stars in both clusters @xcite , with the bluer ms stars being more he enriched .",
    "on the other hand almost all gcs * observed to date * @xcite show some kind of spread in their element content at the level of the rgb , the most evident being the spread in na and o , elements that are anticorrelated @xcite .",
    "na and o abundances are also ( anti)correlated with other light elements , such as c , n , mg , and al @xcite .",
    "the most natural explanation for this phenomenon is that clusters experienced an extended period of star formation , where the younger populations were born from an interstellar medium polluted by products of the cno * ( and possibly nena , mgal ) * cycle coming from massive stars of the former generation ( * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) . in this picture",
    "the interstellar medium is affected by an enhancement of its he content , together with n , na , and al , while c and o turn out to be depleted .",
    "this hypothesis can also explain correlations or anticorrelations of light elements present at the level of unevolved stars @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can not be due to evolutionary effects like deep mixing processes that happen on the red giant branch ( rgb ) only after the first dredge - up ( i.e. in stars brighter than the rgb - bump ) , since it is also present in ms stars .",
    "evidence for a direct correlation between the he and na abundances is now accumulating .",
    "@xcite found differences in the abundances of na as well as of other elements along the different main sequences of ngc  2808 . in another paper @xcite",
    ", the same group found correlations between several expected features likely related to altered he abundances and the na abundances for stars along the rgb for several clusters ( the most clear evidence being again for ngc  2808 ) .",
    "very recently , @xcite and @xcite observed that the chromospheric he i 10830    line is stronger in na - rich rgb stars in @xmath5  cen and ngc  2808 , respectively , than in na - poor stars .",
    "@xcite found that the extension of the na - o anticorrelation is related to the extension of the horizontal branch ( hb ) , suggesting that the anticorrelation may be related also to hb morphology .    long ago",
    "@xcite , measuring the strength of the cn band at 3839   in m4 , was the first to speculate on the possible connection between light - element and hb morphology in m4 .",
    "@xcite were the first to speculate on the connection between super - oxygen - poor stars and blue hb morphology in m3 and m13 .",
    "it has been clear since the 1960s that the hb morphology is related not only to the cluster iron content ( as expected from the models ) , but also to other parameters ( the so called _ second parameter problem _ ) which must account for the fact that some clusters have an hb extended or extremely extended to the blue , while others of the same metallicity do not .",
    "* @xcite showed that the main candidate to be the second parameter is age .",
    "however they indicate also that at least a third parameter is required , and that it is most likely he .",
    "*    a spread in he abundance can reproduce the hb morphology in gcs ( as first noticed by @xcite ) ( see also the extensive analysis by @xcite ) . according to this picture ,",
    "both stars with normal and enhanced he content end up on the zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) after the onset of core he burning .",
    "however , if mass loss in the previous phase is similar , he - rich stars should be less massive ( and thus warmer ) than he - normal ones because they burn h faster when they are on the main sequence .",
    "so he enhancement could provide the mechanism required to spread stars from the redder and cooler hb ( stars with normal composition ) to the hotter and bluer part of the hb ( he - rich stars ) as discussed in @xcite",
    ".    however , the most direct evidence , the spectroscopic determination of he abundances directly for the hb stars , is still scarce .",
    "* hereafter vi09 ) analyzed a sample of stars in ngc  6752 belonging to the hb in the t@xmath6 range between 8000 and 9000 k. as discussed in that paper only stars between 8500 and 11500 k are good targets for this purpose because they are sufficiently hot to show features of he in their spectra but cooler than the grundahl - jump @xcite , the temperature limit above which stars show evidence of metal levitation and he sedimentation , which alters the original surface abundances @xcite .",
    "vi09 found for all zahb stars of the redder part of the blue hb in ngc  6752 a na - o content that , when compared with the na - o anticorrelation found for the rgb @xcite , demonstrates that they belong to the na - poor and o - rich ( primordial ) population .",
    "the only evolved hb target , which likely comes from the bluer hb , belongs to the na - rich , o - poor population .",
    "but , most important , they show that stars of the redder zahb are all helium - normal ( y=0.25@xmath10.01 , where y is the fractional mass of he ) , in agreement with the proposed scenario .",
    "in addition , very recently @xcite found a direct correlation between na and o abundances and colours of the stars along the hb of m4 .",
    "in fact , rhb stars are all na - poor and o - rich , while bhb are all na - rich and o - poor . according to this result we expect the bhb to be he - rich , and the rhb to be he - normal .    while all of this data point toward a connection between he spread and hb morphology , a key piece of information is still missing to finally confirm empirically this scenario .",
    "we need to verify whether zahb stars suitable for he measurement ( 8500@xmath7t@xmath811500 k ) and belonging to the bluer hb indeed show a he - enhancement .",
    "the aim of this paper is to fill this gap by measuring the he content in blue hb ( hereafter bhb ) stars of m4 ( ngc  6121 ) .",
    "this cluster has been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "it has a bimodal hb with the hotter stars at t@xmath99500 k , and a bimodal na - o anticorrelation , which is possibly related to a spread in he abundance .",
    "for this reason it is the ideal target for our purposes .",
    "we want to verify whether the hot hb stars of m4 are he - rich , as well as na - rich / o - poor . in section 2",
    "we describe the observations . in sec .",

    "for this reason , we applied the corrections by @xcite and @xcite , interpolated to the atmospheric parameters of our stars . on the other hand ,",
    "as shown by vi09 , he abundances are not affected by nlte , probably because the he line at 5875  , due to the very high e.p .",
    ", is formed in very deep layers of the atmosphere , where departure from the lte condition is negligible due to the high density of the gas .",
    "a further discussion is required about nlte correction for fe . some authors ( i.e. @xcite ) claim that for a type stars like vega or our targets a nlte correction of + 0.3 dex must be applied to fei lte abundances , while feii are formed in lte approximation .",
    "slightly smaller non - lte corrections have been recently estimated for such stars by @xcite .",
    "all our tests show instead that no nlte correction is required for fei , at least down to log(g)=3.0 .",
    "first of all , the analysis for vega done in vi09 assuming lte gave us the same abundance for fei and feii within 0.02 dex , comparable with the r.m.s  scatter .",
    "this result was confirmed by the analysis of the other targets of vi09 and by @xcite . in particular gravities of vi09",
    "were obtained from the wings of h balmer lines , which are formed in lte approximation . in spite of that no appreciable difference",
    "was found in the mean fei and feii abundances of the stars ( @xmath0[fe / h]=0.04@xmath10.05 dex ) .",
    "there is a further effect to take into account .",
    "our results indicate that all the stars are he - rich ( y@xmath20.29 , see next section ) . in spite of that for our analysis we used atmosphere models with normal he - content ( y@xmath20.25 ) .",
    "the question is whether this difference has some impact on the final abundances .",
    "we answered this by calculating with atlas9 a new he - enhanced atmosphere model for the star # 46061 , considered as representative of our sample .",
    "then we recalculated the abundances .",
    "we found that o , na , and fe do not change in a significant way ( 0.01 dex or less ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the he content changes by @xmath0log@xmath30(he)=+0.03 dex .",
    "the reason could be that he lines form deep in the atmosphere where temperature is higher and the uv flux , strongly dominated by h and he opacity , is greater .",
    "this changes the structure of the atmosphere in the deepest layers and the strength of the spectral lines that are formed there .",
    "we took into account this effect by applying a correction @xmath0log@xmath30(he)=+0.03 dex * ( @xmath0y=0.015 ) * to the values for he obtained assuming he - normal atmosphere models .    *",

    "meanwhile , we have further investigated this problem . by comparing our photometry , based on observations taken with the wide - field imager at the eso2.2 m telescope both for ngc  6752 and m4 , with stetson s database @xcite",

    "continuous lines have [ fe / h]=-1.00 , while dashed lines have [ fe / h]=-1.50 in order to cover the metal content of the two clusters . we note that colors in this temperature regime are very dependent on gravity but are almost unaffected by metallicity .",
    "the scatter for m4 stars is a bit higher than that for ngc  6752 , due to the differential reddening affecting the former cluster .    if we compare t@xmath6 from b - v colors with those obtained from spectroscopy for the two clusters , we find that for m4 the latter are underestimated by about 100 k , while for ngc  6752 they are overestimated by about 200 k. we are left with a net difference of 100 k. part or all of this discrepancy is related to uncertainties in the value we adopted for the interstellar reddening , because even a small error of 0.01 mag would lead to an error of @xmath37  k in the effective temperatures . on average ,",
    "the good agreement between temperatures from colours and from spectra is then comforting , and we can assume 150 k as un upper limit for the systematic error in temperature .",
    "a better indication concerning the t@xmath6 systematic errors comes from the comparison between our [ fe / h ] ( -1.06 , see next section ) with ( * ? ? ? * -1.07 ) and ( * ? ? ? * -1.12 ) .",
    "first of all we note that both datasets were taken with the same instrument , so systematic effects on abundances due to the spectrograph ( as happens for example comparing abundances measured with uves and giraffe , @xcite ) can be ruled out .",
    "the difference is only 0.01 dex with respect to @xcite and 0.06 dex with respect to @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "an error as large as 100  k on our spectroscopic t@xmath6  would imply an offset of 0.10  dex .",
    "we can see that in the worst case comparison with @xcite gives 50 k as an estimate for our systematic error in temperature .",
    "finally @xcite checked the reliability of their atmospheric parameters comparing their t@xmath6 with those derived from models by @xcite .",
    "their sample of stars distributes with a dispersion of @xmath250 k and has a null offset with respect to the line of perfect agreement ( see their fig .",
    "2 ) . this implies a negligible systematic error on temparature , valid also for our data because in the two papers targets are similar and the methodology is the same .",
    "after these tests we assume @xmath0t@xmath6=50 k as the systematic error on our t@xmath6 scale but we will consider also the upper limit @xmath0t@xmath6@xmath7150 k in the discussion .",
    "systematic errors on our gravity scale can arise from the fact that we use fei / ii balance to obtain log(g ) . as said in the previous section",
    "this can introduce a systematic shift if fei lines are formed in nlte ( while feii lines form in lte ) , as suggested by some authors .",
    "thanks to our results on vega and on other a stars presented in vi09 , we think we have shown that fei lines can be safely treated with lte approximation , and as a consequence systematic errors on the log(g ) scale should be negligible .",
    "this statement is further supported by @xcite . here",
    "the authors analize a t@xmath6=12045 k , log(g)=3.9 dex star using kurucz s models , as in our case .",
    "they obtain atmospheric parameters from strmgren photometry . as they say , _ atlas9 model with the parameters t@xmath6=12045 k , log(g)=3.9 derived from the strmgren photometry meets the requirement of same iron abundance from all the different kinds of iron lines_. in fact , they obtain the same abundance for fei and feii lines .",
    "if this is true for a 12000 k star , where nlte effect ( if present ) should be larger than in our colder stars due to the stronger iron overionization , we can safely assume that lte works well as an approximation for the atmosphere models of our targets , and it can be used to obtain unbiased gravities .",
    "however we decided to perform further tests .",
    "for this purpose we calculated the mass ( @xmath38 ) of our stars by inverting the canonical equation :    @xmath39    where    @xmath40    and    @xmath41    bolometric correction ( bc ) was taken from @xcite , and distance modulus @xmath42 from @xcite . results and relative errors",

    "we show this statistically by calculating the probability to find by chance six stars all belonging to the o - poor / na - rich population , under the hypothesis that the hb morphology does not depend on the o / na chemical content .",

    "we found that all the blue hb objects are o - poor / na - rich , as in the present paper . on the other hand",
    "the two red hb stars with measured o are o - rich / na - poor .",
    "all the remaining red hb stars for which we collected giraffe spectra have na that is compatible with the o - rich / na - poor population .",
    "again , the probability to find this result by chance is extremely low , in this case well below 1% .",
    "the clear conclusion is that , at least for m4 , the hb morphology is related to * the light element content , specifically na and o*.    but a more important result regards the he content . in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] we compare the observed spectra around the he line with 5 synthetic spectra with different he content .",
    "the stars turn out to have a mean he content of @xmath45=11.01@xmath10.02 .",
    "this translates into :    @xmath46    * in tab .",
    "[ t2 ] logaritmic he abundances @xmath45 for single stars were trasformed in mass fraction y value as well . * as noted before , our best estimation of the systematic error on the he measurement is :    @xmath47    while the upper limit is :    @xmath44    we conclude that the he content of our stars is larger than that of the primordial universe ( y@xmath20.24@xmath30.25 ) with a level of confidence of about 4@xmath18 if we only consider the internal error .",
    "if we combine internal and systematic errors using the squared sum , the level of confidence is lower but still more than 2@xmath18 .",
    "it is less than 2@xmath18 ( between 1.3 and 1.6@xmath18 , depending on if we assume y=0.24 or y=0.25 for the primordial content ) only if we use the upper limit for the systematic error .",
    "a possible point against the significance of our result comes from @xcite .",
    "this paper suggests that after the first dredge - up , the y content of a star increases by @xmath20.015 for z=0.001 ( roughly the metallicity of m4 ) .",
    "so we should compare our absolute abundance with y@xmath20.24@xmath30.25 + 0.015@xmath20.26 .",
    "this would lower our significance to 1.7@xmath18 ( 1.0@xmath18 if we use the upper limit for the systematic error ) .",
    "* however this he enhancement due to the first dredge - up is controversial , because other mechanisms ( e.g. atomic diffusion , radiative acceleration , and turbulence ) could be at work and playing a role in defining the precise he difference between ms and hb*.    while not definitively proven , we believe our data strongly hints at a he abundance larger than the primordial value or than the value expected for a he - normal star after the first dredge - up . in the following",
    ", we will give various arguments that definitely support a similar conclusion .",
    "first , we can compare the present results with the he content of hb stars of ngc 6752 found by vi09 . in both studies",
    ", we used the same spectrograph and methodology to estimate he abundance .",
    "therefore , in such a comparison any systematic error is cancelled out .",
    "vi09 found y=0.25@xmath10.01 for their sample of stars all belonging to the redder part of the blue hb of that cluster .",
    "such a value is compatible with the primordial he abundance of the universe .",
    "the stars of the present study are instead located on the bluer part of the hb of m4 , and are then expected to be he - enhanced .",
    "the y values of the two samples differ at the level of 2.8@xmath18 .",
    "we also applied a kolmogorov - smirnov test to the two datasets .",
    "this test concludes that the two distributions are not compatible , with a confidence level of more than 90% .",
    "we note that in this case the @xcite result does not affect the comparison because bhb targets in both clusters should have experienced the same surface he - enhancement after the first dredge - up .",
    "_ therefore we conclude that m4 bhb stars are he - enhanced_.    we next compare m4 and ngc  6752 in more detail including o and na . for this purpose",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ( upper panel ) o and na abundances from the following sources : m4 rgb stars ( filled circles ) from @xcite , ngc  6752 rgb stars ( stars ) from @xcite , m4 hb stars ( open circles , this work ) , and ngc  6752 hb stars ( open squares ) from @xcite .",
    "we see that rgb stars of the two clusters define a common na - o anticorrelation fitted by the curve .",
    "ngc  6752 stars cover a larger range both in o and na .",
    "hb stars follow the same curve , as expected , but they map only a limited part of the anticorrelation , due to the fact that they are located in a restricted part of the hb . according to the results of this paper , the na - o anticorrelation is accompanied by a he - o anticorrelation .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ( lower left panel ) .",
    "red crosses are the mean values and errorbars for the two groups of stars , while the curve is the fit to the na - o trend shifted and compressed in the y direction in order to match the observed points .",
    "this curve represents the he content that a stars has according to its na abundance . in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ( lower right panel ) we report also the he - na correlation .",
    "again red crosses are the mean values and errorbars for the two groups , while the straight line is the fit to the data .",
    "this fit has the following form :    @xmath48 + 10.95\\pm 0.02}$ ]    in order to verify if these stars have also a homogeneous he content , we performed a detailed analysis of internal errors for this element .",
    "helium was measured by comparing the observed spectrum with 5 synthetic ones , adopting the value that minimizes the r.m.s .",
    "scatter of the differences .",
    "the s / n of the real spectrum and the strength of the he line introduce an error in the final he abundance which can be estimated calculating the error on the r.m.s .  scatter .",
    "for our data this error corresponds to uncertainties in the abundance of 0.06 dex .",
    "this value must be added to the errors due to the uncertainties on atmospheric parameters .",
    "as discussed before @xmath0t@xmath6=50 k gives @xmath0log@xmath30(he)=0.02 dex , @xmath0log(g)=0.06 gives @xmath0log@xmath30(he)=0.02 dex , while the error on microturbulence has no appreciable influence .",
    "the final uncertainty on the he abundance is given by the squared sum of all the individual errors , and the final result is @xmath0log@xmath30(he)@xmath49=0.07 dex .",
    "if we compare this value to the observed dispersion ( 0.06@xmath10.02 dex ) , we can conclude that our hb stars are compatible with having a homogeneous he content .    as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "levitation and sedimentation are present in hb stars with temperatures hotter than 11500 k. as our stars are cooler , we expect that they are not affected by these phenomena . with the purpose of verifying this hypothesis we plotted log@xmath30(he ) , [ el / fe ] and [ fe / h ] vs. t@xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] . for each element we plotted the best fitting ( continuous ) and the @xmath11@xmath18 lines ( dashed ) .",
    "all the elements show a trend that is flat within the errors .",
    "+ considering also that our abundances agree well with the rgb values of @xcite , we conclude that none of the elements measured in the present paper show evidence of levitation or he sedimentation .",
    "as noted by many authors ( e.g. @xcite ) , the brightness of the hb depends on the he content .",
    "the higher the he content , the brighter the hb . as our bhb stars",
    "are he enhanced , while the reddest hb stars in each cluster are expected to be he - normal ( y@xmath20.25 , as we found in ngc 6752 ) , we also expect a difference in v magnitude between the two branches .",
    "the difference depends on the exact he difference , but for a value of the order of @xmath0y@xmath20.04 suggested by our analysis , it should be of the order of * @xmath20.15 mag @xcite*. in order to verify this hypothesis we compared our photometry with zero age hb models by @xcite . at this point the differential reddening affecting the cluster is a problem because it blurs out the exact hb location . to solve this issue we corrected the cmd for the differential reddening as explained in @xcite . then , in order to locate exactly the hb , we built up the hess diagram plotted in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] .    in this figure , the red hb is clearly visible as a bump at b - v=0.93 , v=13.49 , while the blue hb is the overdensity covering the range @xmath50b - v@xmath51 and @xmath52v@xmath53 .",
    "we overplotted on both branches the hb lower envelope lines ( the continuous lines ) drawn to be 3@xmath54v brighter than the faintest hb star , where @xmath0v is the typical photometric error at the level of the hb .",
    "dashed lines in the plot are the zero age hb models for the metallicity of the cluster by @xcite with y=0.24 ( fainter line ) and y=0.28 ( brighter line ) .",
    "models were shifted to the red by e(b - v)=0.36 , and shifted in v in order to fit the lower envelope of the red hb with the model at y=0.24 . _",
    "the model for y=0.24 does not fit the lower envelope of the blue hb , which is brighter , as expected if it is he - enhanced_. then , we estimated the difference in v magnitude between the model at y=0.24 and * the blue hb zahb*. it turned out to be @xmath20.1 mag .    *",
    "this implies a difference in he of the two hbs of @xmath0y@xmath20.02 according to the models of @xcite , and of @xmath0y@xmath20.03 according to @xcite .",
    "*    we conclude the photometric test further supports our contention that blue hb stars in m4 are he - enhanced ( y=0.29 ) with respect to the red hb by @xmath0(y)=0.02@xmath30.03 .",
    "although we claim that m4 blue hb stars are he - enhanced , several previous papers found no evidence for this .",
    "the first is @xcite . here",
    "the author obtained chemical abundances ( including he ) for a sample of blue hb stars around the grundahl - jump for 6 clusters : m13 , m15 , m3 , m68 , m92 , ngc288 . in his fig .",
    "22 the author reports [ he / h ] value as a function of log(t@xmath6 ) , and apparently this does not support our result about the he - enhancement because all stars cooler than the grundahl - jump are compatible with a normal he content ( [ he / h]@xmath20 ) .",
    "however we wish to call attention to the following point . for three clusters ( i.e. m13 ,",
    "m15 , m92 ) the targets cooler than the grundahl - jump belong to the reddest part of the hb so , as in the case of @xcite , they are indeed expected to be he - normal .",
    "two of the remaining clusters ( ngc288 and m68 ) do not have enough points below the grundahl - jump to derive a firm conclusion .",
    "we are left with m3 . the first impression from fig .",
    "22 of @xcite is that these stars have a normal he content , but we immediately see that the errors are huge ( @xmath20.7 dex in the single measurement ) .",
    "secondly , stars are located in the intermediate region of the hb ( see fig . 1 of @xcite ) ,",
    "so their he - enhancement , if any , is expected to be close to the primordial value .",
    "finally we point out that all @xcite he measurements appear to be underestimated .",
    "for example m3 has a mean he content of [ he / h]@xmath2 - 0.5 , which translates into y@xmath20.10 , clearly too low .",
    "the explication is that @xcite was not interested in the absolute abundance of he as we are , but rather in the trend of he ( among the other elements ) with position along the hb .",
    "so he did not check possible systematic errors in his methods ( e.g. the he linelist ) . for his purposes",
    "this was not necessary , but it makes a comparison with the present paper very problematic .",
    "a second paper is @xcite . here",
    "the authors compare the hb of m3 with theoretical models having different he content .",
    "they assert and show in their fig .  2 and 3 that there is no evidence of he enhancement because the model with y=0.25 fits well the hb .",
    "however , as @xcite says , the fit is good , _ except perhaps for a small deviation of the lower envelope of the blue hb stars in the immediate vicinity of the `` knee '' from the theoretical ( single - y ) zahb._. the deviation is of @xmath20.05 mag , with the stars brighter than the model .",
    "this value is small , but clearly visible and points toward a he - enhancement of blue hb stars in m3 with respect to red hb stars .",
    "we would have expected an even larger deviation for the bluest hb stars of the cluster which are expected to be even more he - rich , but in that region of the hb the models are degenerate .",
    "we can assert that @xcite , instead of contradicting our finding , actually supports it .",
    "* finally @xcite fit the hb of ngc  1851 with their theoretical models in order to obtain some hint about nature of the two populations of the clusters that were identified by @xcite as a bimodal sgb . they can fit the hb with two models . in the first the two populations",
    "are assumed to have an age difference of 1 gyrs and the same ( primordial ) he , cno , anf fe content . in the second they are coeval and have different cno ( but the same primordial he and the same fe ) .",
    "apparently there is no room for an he - enhancement .",
    "first of all we notice that more recent papers @xcite found that stars in ngc  1851 have the same cno content but different fe ( @xmath20.06 dex ) . a difference in fe have an impact on the age difference that is @xmath20.5 gyrs ( assuming the same cno ) .",
    "so none of the models by @xcite is appropriate to fit the hb . on the other hand",
    "if we consider in their fig . 2 ( e.g. lower panel ) the line that connect the red part with coolest part of the blue synthethic hb and",
    "project it on the observed hb ( in order to fit the observed red hb ) , we can see that the observed blue hb is slightly brighter than this line . according to any hb model that assume the same cno content ( including @xcite , see their fig .",
    "1 ) this is an indication that the blue hb is he - enhancend with respect the red .",
    "this fact is confirmed by a recent paper @xcite . here",
    "the authors obtained a spectroscopic estimation of y=+0.29@xmath10.05 for the bhb .",
    "the error is quite large , but they show photometrically that the hb can be fitted only assuming y=+0.248 and y=+0.280 for the red and blue hbs respectivelly .",
    "*    we conclude this section by noting that literature statements against the presence of he - rich stars in gcs are not conclusive , and that they are refuted by a new interpretation of the data or by new results .",
    "correlations and anticorrelations of chemical elements observed in gcs ( i.e. na vs. o and mg vs. al ) are attributed to contamination by products of the h - burning process at high temperature ( @xcite , @xcite ) , when n is produced at the expense of o and c , and proton capture on ne and mg produces na and al ( cno , * nena , and mgal * cycles ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that this contamination is present also at the level of the ms .",
    "this means that it is not the result of a mixing mechanism present when a star leaves the ms , but it is rather due to primordial pollution of the interstellar material from which stars were formed .",
    "the mixing mechanism along the rgb can have an effect , but only as far as c and n are concerned @xcite .",
    "pollution must come from more massive stars .",
    "gcs must have experienced some chemical evolution at the beginning of their life ( see @xcite for extensive references ) .",
    "the main product of h - burning is he and a he enhancement is then expected to be present in stars with an enhancement of n , na , and al .",
    "the main classes of candidate polluters are : fast - rotating massive main - sequence stars @xcite , intermediate - mass agb stars @xcite , and also massive binary stars @xcite .",
    "all these channels can potentially pollute the existing interstellar material with products of complete cno burning , including he ( see @xcite for an extensive review ) .",
    "recently @xcite showed that for m4 the best candidates that can reproduce the abundance pattern observed for rgb stars are massive main - sequence stars .    in the pollution scenario , a first generation of o - rich and na - poor stars ( relative to a second stellar generation )",
    "is formed from primordial homogeneous material , which must have been polluted by previous sn explosions .",
    "this generation also has a primordial or close to primordial he content ( y=0.24@xmath30.25 ) .",
    "then the most massive stars of this pristine stellar generation pollute the interstellar material with products of the cno cycle .",
    "this material is kept in the cluster due to the relatively strong gravitational field @xcite , and it gives rise to a new generation of o - poor and na - rich stars .",
    "this population should also have been he - enhanced ( y=0.27 - 0.35 , depending on the major polluter and on the amount of retained material , @xcite ) . also the abundance of other elements ( including s - process elements ) may differ in stars of the first or second generation .    in the ms phase ,",
    "he - rich stars evolve more rapidly than he - poor ones , so he / na - rich ( and o - poor ) stars presently at the turn - off or in later phases of evolution should be less massive than he / na - poor ( and o - rich ) ones . in this framework",
    ", @xcite and @xcite proposed that a spread in he , combined with mass loss along the rgb , may be the main ingredient to naturally reproduce the whole hb morphology in gcs , as discussed in the introduction . according to this scenario , primordial he - o rich and na poor stars",
    "end up on the redder part of the hb , while stars with extreme abundance alterations ( strong he enhancement , o - poor and na - rich ) may end up on the bluer part of the hb , if they have experienced enough mass loss during the rgb phase .",
    "the extensive comparison between the distribution of colours along the hb and the na - o anti - correlation by @xcite also supports this view .",
    "also age must play a role , because it determines the mean mass of a star that reaches the hb @xcite .",
    "we stress that the hb represents the ideal locus to investigate the effects of chemical anomalies in gc stars , as the hb is a sort of amplifier of the physical conditions that are the consequence of the star composition and previous evolution .    in this scenario , in m4 , we expect that the progeny of rgb he - normal , o - rich and na - poor stars should reside in the red part of the hb .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the observed red hb stars of @xcite are all o - rich , na - poor .",
    "but they are too cold to have their he content measured directly .",
    "@xcite show also that blue hb stars are all o - poor and na - rich .",
    "here we reinforce this result with higher s / n spectra and more precise measurements .",
    "but we go further , measuring the he content of the blue hb .",
    "all our stars turned out to be he - enhanced * ( y=0.29)*. by comparing photometry with hb models , we * showed that the blue hb is brighter than the red , as expected if they have a different he content*.    if we consider both the he and na / o content of our targets , our result strongly confirms the hypothesis suggested by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and shows that he ( coupled with light - element spread ) is one of the best candidates ( together with the metal content and age ) to explain the hb morphology of gcs and thus is a strong candidate for the 2@xmath4 parameter ( or for the 3@xmath55 according to @xcite ) .",
    "we studied a sample of bhb stars in m4 with a temperature in the range 9000 - 9500 k , with the aim of measuring their he and na / o content .",
    "targets were selected in order to be hot enough to show the he feature at 5875  , but cold enough to avoid the problem of he sedimentation and metal levitation affecting hb stars hotter than 11500 k. thanks to the high resolution and high s / n of our spectra , we were able to measure he abundances for all our stars .",
    "this is only the second , direct measurement of he content from high resolution spectra of gc stars in this t@xmath6 regime with the aim to test the current models of gc formation and multiple - populations .",
    "our targets have a mean he content of y=0.29 + @xmath10.01 ( internal error ) which is significantly larger than the value found for redder bhb stars in ngc  6752 ( y=0.25@xmath10.01 ) , using the same observational set up and data reduction procedures .",
    "our best estimation for the systematic error is @xmath0y=0.01 ( or 0.014 ) .",
    "however it does not affect the comparison with ngc  6752 or the photometric estimation of the red hb he content .",
    "we compared also the brightness of the red and the blue hb of the cluster , finding that the latter is @xmath20.1 mag brighter then the former .",
    "this result is quite strong , and we can estimate an enhancement in the he content for the stars in the blue vs. red hb of @xmath0y=0.02@xmath30.03 .",
    "this is what we expect if stellar position on the hb is driven by its he and metal content . *",
    "our combined evidence strongly suggests that stars within the same globular cluster and among different globular clusters have different he content * , and that the o - poor / na - rich population is also he - enhanced * with respect the o - rich / na - poor population * , as suggested by many theoretical studies .",
    "he is thus a leading contender for the 2@xmath4 parameter .",
    "our results are consistent with theoretical studies which predict that , for a given metallicity and age , the position of a star in the hb is driven by its he content , and that the spread of stars along the hb must be related to the na / o spread visible at the level of the rgb .    s.v . and",
