    "a novel state of matter , strongly interacting quark - gluon plasma(sqgp ) is claimed to be found at relativistic heavy ion collider at brookhaven national laboratory@xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath0 was found to reach the hydrodynamic limit of an almost perfect fluid with very small viscosity at low transverse momentum region .",
    "it is desirable to explain this near - perfect fluid behavior of sqgp from the theoretical points of view@xcite .    in principle , there are two approaches to calculate transport coefficients .",
    "one is using the kubo formulae@xcite within the thermal field theory , with which people evaluated the shear viscosity via resumming an infinite series of ladder diagrams @xcite .",
    "the alternative framework is the kinetics theory@xcite .",
    "although the transport equations are hard to solve , the relaxation time approximation(rta ) and variational calculus are two popular methods to obtain the transport coefficients . in rta , people use classic kinetic formulae , but involving the relativistic and quantum effects , to estimate the shear viscosity@xcite .",
    "arnold , moore and yaffe@xcite have studied the leading - log contribution as well as the full leading order contribution of various transport coefficients of the qcd - like theory at high temperature by solving the boltzmann equation with variational approach . the results in the two frameworks are coincident in leading - log order except for some factor differences .",
    "some publications also demonstrated that the diagrammatic expansion of kubo formula was actually equivalent to the kinetics calculation from the linearized boltzmann equation if all the possible ladder diagrams were resummed in scalar field@xcite and in pure gauge theory@xcite .",
    "in addition , one should pay attention to the consistency of the ward identity with the ladder resummation@xcite in gauge theory .    however , most works listed above concentrated on the high temperature but vanishing chemical potential except ref.@xcite . while actually the net baryon number in the central fire ball of heavy - ion collision is not zero rigidly though small@xcite .",
    "it makes sense to involve this density effect by introducing a chemical potential @xmath1 , which is much smaller than the temperature , to study how it affects the shear viscosity of the plasma .    in this paper",
    ", we shall try to solve the boltzmann equation by the variational method at high temperature with finite density in qed , following the scheme in ref.@xcite for high temperature and zero chemical potential .",
    "qed is a good toy model for the non - abelian gauge qcd yet simpler in computation .",
    "we found the shear viscous coefficient is proportional to @xmath2 and modified by a small factor of @xmath3 .",
    "besides kinetic theory , we also calculated the viscosity in the framework of thermal field theory@xcite .",
    "the result is consistent with the one in this paper qualitatively but has some quantitative differences .",
    "the paper is arranged as following : in the second section , we will review the sketch of solving boltzmann equation by variational method in the kinetics of transport theory and define the shear viscosity in this framework .",
    "the associated collision processes on the right hand side of boltzmann equation will be calculated in section 3 . and",
    "in the fourth section , we use the variational method to obtain the shear viscosity .",
    "section 5 is conclusion and outlook .",
    "we use the notation @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the momentum denoted by a capital letter is the four - component momentum and the lowercase with bold face denotes the three - component momentum .",
    "considering a system which slightly deviates from the equilibrium state by a small velocity gradient , one can describe it with the one particle distribution which is satisfied the boltzmann equation @xmath6,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the external force . in the case of shear viscosity",
    ", the external field is irrelevant and the time derivation on the left hand side may be dropped out due to its higher order contribution in spacial gradients@xcite .",
    "the right hand side of equation([boltzmann ] ) is the collision term which takes the usual form of @xmath9(\\mathbf{p})&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\mathbf{p'},\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k'}}|\\mathcal{m}(p , k;p',k')|^2(2\\pi)^4\\delta^{(4)}(p+k - p'-k')\\\\[0.3 cm ] & \\times&\\left\\{f(\\mathbf{p})f(\\mathbf{k})[1\\pm f(\\mathbf{p})][1\\pm f(\\mathbf{k})]-f(\\mathbf{p'})f(\\mathbf{k'})[1\\pm f(\\mathbf{p'})][1\\pm f(\\mathbf{k'})]\\right\\}\\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if only @xmath10 elastic collisions are involved . here",

    "the @xmath16 factor is the final state statistical weight for boson with the upper sign and for fermion with the down sign .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor , in the near - equilibrium system , can be decomposed into : @xmath17 where the quantities @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the energy density , pressure , heat current and viscous shear stress , respectively .",
    "the four - velocity @xmath22 in the local rest frame is @xmath23 , with which the stress tensor is assured by @xmath24    expanding the @xmath25 in the small gradients of the four - velocity field , one can obtain @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the shear viscous coefficient .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we expand the distribution function in the near - equilibrium state and obtain the linearized boltzmann equation : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the linearized collision operator . by defining the inner product in function space and variating the trial function @xmath30 ,",

    "another notation one should notice is the sum in front of the matrix element which means all possible collision processes relevant to the leading - log contribution are involved and properly treated without double counting or multi - counting .",
    "in qed , all possible reactions can be classified as two categories : processes of exchanging a boson(fig.1(a ) ) and processes of exchanging a fermion(fig.1(b ) and ( c ) ) , in which the later includes the pair production and the compton scattering processes .",
    "notice that the s - channel scattering is omitted because it is infrared finite thus does not contribute to the leading - log result .    before going into the next step of calculation",
    ", we should specify some important approximations and definitions .    * in our discussion",
    ", we adopt the hard forward scattering approximation , namely the momentum transfer @xmath36 which is small for all the time since it is sufficient to compute the leading - log viscosity .",
    "so we neglect all the differences between the distribution functions such as @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the fermion mass is also omitted in this case , for it is in order of @xmath39 which is much smaller than the hard scale @xmath40 .",
    "thus the kinematics of the two - body collision gives @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the angle between @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 is the angle between @xmath43 and @xmath46 , and the angle between @xmath44 and @xmath46 as well , since they are approximately equal in the forward scattering .",
    "@xmath47 is the angle between the @xmath43-@xmath46 plane and @xmath43-@xmath46 plane . * due to the energy - momentum conservation , only three of the four momenta of incoming and outgoing particles are independent . if we properly label the particles coming from the same vertex with the similar momentum symbols as shown in the figure 1(a ) , for example @xmath48 and @xmath49 , all the three mandelstam variables can be defined as @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . * as to the infrared divergence , the two categories of collisions behave different .",
    "when the momentum transfer @xmath53 ^ 2 $ ] term one may find a small @xmath54 emerges which softens the quadratic divergence into a logarithmical one .",
    "since now all the collision integrations are logarithmically divergent , the limit cut - offs play important roles in our calculation . for transport coefficients like shear viscosity ,",
    "these integrations are dominated by the hard scale @xmath40 of the system which can be chosen as the ultraviolet cut - off . as to the infrared limit",
    ", the hard thermal loop self - energy scale @xmath39 is sufficient@xcite . even in the finite density case ,",
    "the small chemical potential only modifies the infrared cut - off by adding a factor like @xmath55 behind @xmath39 , which does not contribute to the leading - log order @xmath56 since we assume the chemical potential is much small than the typical momentum scale @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "therefore we will not carefully treat the @xmath58 integration and just adopt @xmath40 and @xmath39 as the upper and down limits respectively .",
    "now let us continue our calculation .",
