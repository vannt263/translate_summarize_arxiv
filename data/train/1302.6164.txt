    "the volume of the convex hull of two convex bodies in the euclidean @xmath0-space @xmath1 has been in the focus of research since the 1950s .",

    "this result was reproved by rogers and shephard @xcite in 1958 , using a more general theorem about the so - called _ linear parameter systems _ , and for polytopes by ahn , brass and shin @xcite in 2008 .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the following quantities .    for two convex bodies @xmath2 and @xmath3 in @xmath1 , let @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes @xmath0-dimensional lebesgue measure . furthermore ,",

    "another related quantity is investigated in @xcite , where the author examines @xmath9 in the special case that @xmath2 is a regular simplex and the two congruent copies have the same centre .    in @xcite ,",
    "rogers and shephard used linear parameter systems to show that the minimum of @xmath10 , taken over the family of convex bodies in @xmath1 , is its value for an @xmath0-dimensional euclidean ball , if @xmath6 is the set of translations or that of reflections about a point . nevertheless , their method , approaching a euclidean ball by suitable steiner symmetrizations and showing that during this process the examined quantities do not increase , does not characterize the convex bodies for which the minimum is attained ; they conjectured that , in both cases , the minimum is attained only for ellipsoids ( cf .",
    "p. 94 of @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the method of rogers and shephard @xcite was used also in @xcite .",
    "we remark that the conjecture in @xcite follows from a straightforward modification of theorems 9 and 10 of @xcite .",

    "the first result proves the conjecture of rogers and shephard for copies reflected about a point .    in section  [ sec : discrete ] we introduce variants of these quantities for convex @xmath18-gons in @xmath19 , and for small values of @xmath18 , characterize the polygons for which these quantities are minimal .",
