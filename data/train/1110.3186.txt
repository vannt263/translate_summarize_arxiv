    "the study of open quantum systems has attracted many researchers in theoretical physics during the last decades and is still under intense investigation .",
    "one of the most basic problems in this field is to understand how a quantum particle initially confined inside an open cavity will escape ( see @xcite for a general discussion ) . in the literature ,",
    "such systems are commonly described in terms of the following quantities : the _ nonescape probability _",
    "@xmath19 , which is the probability that the particle will still be inside the cavity at some later time @xmath5 and the _ survival probability _ @xmath20 , which is the probability to find the particle in the initial state at time @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "let us suppose that the configuration space is the one - dimensional half - line @xmath21 and that the cavity is the interval @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "then , at time @xmath23 , the particle is supposed to be in a normalized state @xmath3 satisfying @xmath24 for all @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath26 denotes the hamiltonian of the particle and @xmath27 its state at time @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the reduced planck constant , then the nonescape and survival probabilities are given by @xmath30 where the bar `` @xmath31 '' denotes complex conjugation .",
    "it is easy to check that these quantities satisfy @xmath32 and @xmath33 for all times @xmath28 .",
    "although both quantities are interesting , we shall discuss only @xmath19 in this paper .",
    "note , however , that by analysing the time decay of @xmath19 one automatically gets an upper bound for @xmath20 .",
    "the nonescape probability @xmath19 has been discussed in free 1d quantum systems @xcite , in free 2d quantum billiard systems @xcite and also in 3d quantum systems with finite range potentials @xcite .",
    "interestingly , if the initial state @xmath3 has no bound state components , then it is always found that the long - time behaviour of @xmath19 is a power law : @xmath34 as @xmath13 , where the constant @xmath35 and the exponent @xmath36 depend on the geometry of the system and on the initial state @xmath3 of the particle .",
    "some readers may be surprised since it is well known that various spontaneous decays have been observed to follow an exponential law .",
    "this apparent discrepancy may actually be only a time scale problem .",
    "indeed , although quantum mechanics clearly predicts in general some deviation from exponential decay , the following phases may well occur @xcite : for a short time the decay is parabolic @xmath37 , then it is approximately exponential and finally becomes a power - law at very large times .",
    "in the present paper , we consider the model introduced in @xcite in which the cavity is a one - dimensional loop @xmath22 $ ] crossed by a constant magnetic flux @xmath1 and connected , with coupling parameter @xmath2 , to an infinite one - dimensional lead @xmath38 ( the points @xmath39 and @xmath40 are identified ) , so that the particle may escape freely from the loop .",
    "see [ fig1 ] .",
    "this model contains rich physics and is simple enough to be amenable by analytical means or numerical simulations , and thus has been the subject of several works @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the nonescape probability @xmath4 has never been discussed in this model and it is interesting to know precisely how it depends on the initial state @xmath3 of the particle and on the three physical parameters : the loop s length @xmath0 , the external magnetic flux @xmath1 and the coupling @xmath2 .        in appropriate units , here is a summary of our main results .    *",
    "let @xmath41 , then one has the following scaling law : @xmath42 thus , increasing for example the length of the loop by a factor @xmath43 leads to a nonescape probability evolving @xmath44 times slower . *",
    "the nonescape probability may be written as @xmath45 the constant @xmath7 is given in : it is independent of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and vanishes if @xmath3 has no bound state components or if @xmath8 . in the infinite series",
    ", the leading term always has an odd power .",
    "the coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 are given in  :",
    "they depend on the initial state @xmath3 of the particle , but only the momentum @xmath11 is involved . when @xmath18 , this coincides with the well - known fact that only the zero momentum of @xmath3 plays a role in the long - time behaviour of the nonescape probability @xcite . if @xmath15 , then there are initial states @xmath3 with no bound state components [ ] for which @xmath46 , while the coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath47 always vanish if @xmath48 .",
    "the important consequence is that there are initial states @xmath3 giving a power law decay : @xmath49 where @xmath14 if @xmath15 and @xmath16 if @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , we see that by submitting the loop to an external magnetic flux ( thus going from @xmath18 to @xmath50 ) , one may induce a radical change in the decay rate of @xmath4 . if @xmath15 , then @xmath9 decreases with @xmath2 ( the particle escapes faster in the long run ) and if @xmath17 , then @xmath10 increases with @xmath2 ( the particle escapes slower in the long run ) .",
    "interestingly , similar features were obtained in a circular dielectric cavity containing classical waves @xcite , the nature of the waves ( tm or te ) and the refractive index of the cavity playing a similar role than @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "* assuming the particle to be initially in a bound state of the loop with @xmath18 [ see ] , we computed explicitly @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 [ see  ] . as one may expect , we found that higher energetic bound states decay faster .",
    "interestingly , we observed that the coefficient @xmath10 oscillates , non - periodically , with @xmath1 ; see [ fig5 ] .",
    "we also present some numerical results showing a global picture in time of @xmath4 ; see [ fig6][fig10 ] .",
    "they reveal in particular that if @xmath17 , then by increasing the value of @xmath2 , the particle escapes faster in the beginning but slower in the long run as stated previously .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ the hamiltonian ] , we model the situation depicted in [ fig1 ] in the framework of standard quantum mechanics . in the paper @xcite ,",
    "the scattering processes occurring at the connecting point ( between the loop and the lead ) are described in terms of an energy - independent scattering matrix @xmath51 .",
    "we shall show that this scattering matrix may be used to prescribe boundary conditions at the connecting point for which the hamiltonian of the particle is self - adjoint . in  [ the propagator ] , we solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation and derive its associated propagator .",
    "we then analyse the long time behaviour of the propagator and consequently that of the nonescape probability .",
    "we discuss our general results in  [ discussion ] and consider some particular initial states in  [ numerical results ] . in  [ the interacting case ]",
    ", we present an interesting and highly non - trivial application of the pseudo - spectral method by considering the interacting case with soft - core coulomb potentials .",
    "finally , in  [ conclusion ] we make some concluding remarks .",
    "in standard quantum mechanics , the situation depicted in [ fig1 ] is modelled as follows : the physical states of the particle belong to the hilbert space @xmath52 ) \\oplus l^2([l,\\infty))$ ] and the hamiltonian of the particle reads @xcite @xmath53}(q)\\right]^2~,\\ ] ] where @xmath54}(q)$ ] is the operator of multiplication by @xmath54}(x)$ ] , where @xmath54}(x ) = 1 $ ] if @xmath55 $ ] and @xmath54}(x ) = 0 $ ] otherwise .",
    "here we have set @xmath56 for the reduced planck constant , @xmath57 for the electric charge , @xmath58 for the speed of light and @xmath59 for the mass of the particle .",

    ", we shall use the following convention : @xmath65 if @xmath66 , @xmath67 if @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath26 is an unbounded operator and thus can not be defined on the entire hilbert space @xmath61 .",
    "we thus have to find the domain @xmath72 corresponding to the situation depicted in [ fig1 ] such that @xmath73 for all @xmath74 and @xmath75 is self - adjoint .",
    "the precise definition of a self - adjoint operator is given in appendix  a and we refer to the paper @xcite for some physical motivations .",
    "this section is not crucial to understand the remaining of this paper , so the uninterested reader may look at the scattering matrix and then go directly to the solution . in the paper @xcite ,",
    "the scattering processes occurring at the connection point ( between the loop and the lead ) are described in terms of the following energy - independent ( unitary ) scattering matrix : @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 $ ] . here",

    "see [ fig2 ] .",
