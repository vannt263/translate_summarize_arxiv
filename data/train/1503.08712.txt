    "a large number of cosmological observations @xcite reveal that our universe is experiencing an accelerated expansion at present and the transition from deceleration phase to acceleration phase took place in the recent past @xcite . in the standard einstein gravity , the late time cosmic acceleration is driven by an exotic energy component with huge negative pressure filling the universe , known as ` _ dark energy _ ' @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest candidate of dark energy ( de ) is the cosmological constant ( cc ) @xmath5 .",
    "however , it is plagued with difficult theoretical issues such as fine tuning and cosmic coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "this is important to explore whether dark energy is cosmological constant or it has dynamics . to this effect",
    ", a variety of dynamical dark energy models have been explored in the references @xcite .",
    "the models of unstable dark matter with a non zero cosmological constant can also mimic such dynamics @xcite .",
    "alternatively , large scale modification of gravity has been used to obtain late time cosmic acceleration . at present late time cosmic acceleration",
    "is treated as an established phenomenon however its underlying cause is still unknown . within the framework of einstein gravity and modified theories of gravity",
    ", numerous models can explain the said phenomenon .",
    "although @xmath5cdm model is consistent with present observations , yet there is no satisfactory argument for coincidence problem .",
    "interaction of dark energy with dark matter is one novel approach that might address the mentioned problem .",
    "the interacting dark energy models have been recently proposed by several authors @xcite .",
    "the interaction between dark energy and dark matter may enhance the dark matter , and also affect structure formation .",
    "the investigation of phase space analysis is the one conclusive test for dark energy models .",
    "specifically , the attractor solutions are independent for a wide range of initial conditions .",
    "if the dark energy models have @xmath6 of the order 1 and an accelerated scaling attractor solution , then the coincidence problem can be alleviated .",
    "the non - interacting quintessence @xcite and quintom @xcite models show late time accelerated attractors , and possess @xmath7 as 1 , therefore , they do not provide an adequate solution for coincidence problem . in the literature ,",
    "two forms of interactions have been discussed namely local and non- local .",
    "local forms of interactions are directly proportional to energy density whereas non- local forms are directly proportional to hubble parameter @xmath8 and energy density @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we consider local forms of interactions proportional to energy density .",
    "some of the local forms have been discussed in references @xcite .",
    "note that some of the choices of interacting terms appeared implicitly in the literature @xcite .",
    "there is also approach to discuss the interacting term without the assumption of a specific form of interacting term @xcite .",
    "the plan of the work is organised as follows : in section [ qc ] we establish the interacting quintessence cosmological framework and construct an autonomous dynamical system which is worthy for phase space investigation . in section [ psa ]",
    "we discuss phase space analysis and find stationary points and their stability for three interacting quintessence cosmological models .",
    "our results are presented in section [ conc ] .",
    "we consider two components first one is canonical scalar field ( quintessence ) as a source of dark energy in spatially flat universe , and second one is matter ( baryonic+dm ) .",
    "the total energy density of the universe is conserved , and the individual components of energy density may not be conserved .",
    "thus , we are considering following conservation equations of energy density as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the equation of state of matter , @xmath0 is the interaction strength and @xmath8 is the hubble parameter which is given as @xmath14 the sign of @xmath0 gives information about the direction of flow of energy between two components .",
    "there are 3 cases : + case i : if @xmath15 , in this case transfer of energy occurs from quintessence to dark matter .",
    "consequently , quintessence losses self strength and gives dark matter .",
    "+ case ii : if @xmath16 , under this condition dark matter losses its strength and there is energy transfer from dark matter to quintessence .",
    "+ case iii : if @xmath17 , under this condition quintessence do not interact with dark matter , and no energy transfer at all between two components considered in the literature . therefore , we are not considering this case .",
    "since , there is no fundamental theory of dark energy and dark matter interaction ( interaction in dark sector ) at present , therefore it is not possible to construct the functional form of interaction strength @xmath0 from first principle .",
    "different forms of interaction strength ( linear and non - linear ) have been considered by several authors @xcite .",
    "motivated from the left hand side of the energy conservation equation ( [ conser ] ) it is natural that @xmath0 should be the function of hubble parameter and energy density that is @xmath18 here we consider three specific forms of interaction strength heuristically as : @xmath19 since , hubble parameter has the dimension of inverse of time , and inverse of time is sitting in the rate change of energy density , see equations ( [ a1])@xmath20 ( [ a3 ] ) , therefore we are not incorporating @xmath8 separately in the functional form of @xmath0 .",
    "the evolution equations in a flat friedmann- lemaitre- robertson- walker ( flrw ) universe can be written as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we introduce following dimensionless parameters @xmath25 to form an autonomous system of evolution equations ( [ conser ] ) and ( [ hdot ] ) as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the total equation of state and field density parameter are given as : @xmath28 the condition for acceleration is @xmath29 .",
    "in this section we shall use an autonomous system [ equation ( [ n15 ] ) ] , which is appropriate for obtaining stationary points and stability . the stationary points shall be obtained by equating the left hand side of equation ( [ n15 ] ) to zero . their stability will be confirmed from the sign of the corresponding eigenvalues , which will be obtained numerically .      in this model",
    "we consider the following specific form of interaction strength @xmath30 using equation ( [ hdot ] ) for this phenomenological form of interaction we have @xmath31\\label{n16}\\ ] ] by using @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "thus , from equation ( [ n15 ] ) with equation ( [ n16 ] ) we have following form of autonomous system @xmath34\\\\ \\nonumber \\dfrac{dy}{dn}&=&-\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}\\lambda xy + \\frac{3}{2}y\\left[\\frac{1-y^{2}+x^{2}(1 - 2\\alpha)}{1-\\alpha } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using equations ( [ wtot ] ) and ( [ n16 ] ) , the total equation of state for this model can be written as @xmath35\\equiv w_{\\phi } \\omega_{\\phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath36 \\mbox{\\bf ( a ) } & \\mbox{\\bf ( b ) } \\end{array}$ ] @xmath37 \\mbox{\\bf ( c ) } & \\mbox{\\bf ( d ) } \\end{array}$ ]    the critical points of autonomous system ( [ n18 ] ) could be obtained by setting @xmath38 and @xmath39 simultaneously .",

    "<S> in this paper , we investigate coupled quintessence with scaling potential assuming specific forms of the coupling as @xmath0 namely , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and present phase space analysis for three different interacting models . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the attractor solutions that can give rise to late time acceleration with @xmath4 of order unity in order to alleviate the coincidence problem . </S>"
