    "quasars are among the most energetic objects known , and as such they can be observed at very high redshift .",
    "it is therefore tempting to use them as tracers of the properties of the distant universe .",
    "however , their relation to the physics of the far universe is not yet well established , in particular their link with galaxy formation and early evolution , and with density enhancements .",
    "if there exist a measurable relation , then qsos could be used as light houses to study those phenomena at high redshift .",
    "whatever the mechanisms to form and feed qsos are , it seems that they would be associated with dynamical activity , merging in particular (  @xcite ) , perhaps in regions of higher than average density where the merging processes would be more frequent .",
    "it is well known that at low redshift ( z @xmath8 0.6 ) qsos are not frequently found in pairs , and very seldom sitting in clusters or dense groups ( @xcite ;  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the situation might be different at high - z , when massive galaxies are forming and merging processes are frequent .",
    "indeed , qsos could be associated with massive primordial galaxies , or be the result of violent interaction among galaxies ( merging or galactic cannibalism ) which would be more frequent in the central parts of massive clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "if this is the case , high redshift qsos would tend to appear associated in pairs or small groups , probably located in overdense regions .",
    "there are a number of arguments which support those views .",
    "regarding the spatial qso distribution , it is known that the qso 2-point correlation length is similar to that of normal galaxies , @xmath9 5 - 6h@xmath10 mpc (  @xcite ) , at all redshifts ( @xcite ;  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the distribution of pairs of qsos ( with projected angular distance @xmath11 ) is similar to that of galaxy cluster pairs ( @xcite ) .",
    "results by different teams do support the idea of some qso grouping at high redshift .",
    "@xcite found three close quasar pairs at @xmath12 based on the palomar transit grism survey .",
    "@xcite , have identified a number of emission candidates ( lecs ) in a field that shows a decrement in the cmbr temperature , supposedly produced by an unseen cluster at z@xmath42.5 .",
    "three of the identified objects in the field ( of which 2 were previously known ) are qsos at the same redshift .",
    "it can also be mentioned the result by  @xcite , who have found a number of lecs around a powerful radio galaxy .",
    "one of the objects that has been confirmed spectroscopically is a qso at a redshift slightly higher than that of the radio - galaxy itself .",
    "the last empirical argument is related to the density peak found by  @xcite at z@xmath43 .",
    "it also contains a qso in one of its sub - condensations .",
    "it has been shown by  @xcite that the environments of bright qsos at intermediate z values show an enhanced projected galaxy density compared to the general field .",
    "clustering at redshift @xmath132 is still poorly constrained by observational data .",
    "however , evidence for clustering is going to grow rapidly with the advent of large telescopes .",
    "@xcite have recently presented strong evidence of a significant concentration of galaxies at z@xmath43 based on lyman - break color selection .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite have measured star formation rates on seven emitting galaxies located in a filament at @xmath1 , detected with narrow - band imaging techniques , and confirmed spectroscopically .",
    "direct searches have not yet given definitive answers (  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the identification of luminous objects associated with forming clusters would be of great help in the study of matter at high redshift .",
    "if the nature of qsos or , in general , very energetic objects , is somehow related to the density of their environment ( at least in the early epochs of galaxy formation ) , then would we expect small scale clustering of qsos , and clusters around every qso ?",
    "a question that is difficult to unambiguously answer by means of previous qsos catalogs , as they are based on surveys that search for the presence of radio emission , uv excess or strong emission lines .",
    "here we address this question directly .    in this work we present the results of a photometric search for lecs around 47 qsos at z@xmath33 .",
    "we also report the spectroscopic follow up of 12 of the 13 unresolved candidates we found . the observational strategy used to look for candidates",
    "is discussed in section  2 .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section  3 . in order to consider qsos separately",
    ", we pay special attention in classifying stellar and non - stellar candidates .",
    "the discussion and summary are given in section  4 .",
    "in order to study the clustering properties of high redshift qsos at small scales , and their possible association with galaxy clusters , we carried out a systematic search for strong emitters in the neighborhood of known qsos .",
    "based on the vlt filter availability ( see table  [ filters ] ) , we selected all known qsos in the southern hemisphere , with redshift within the ranges 2.863@xmath8 z @xmath8 2.959 , and 3.090@xmath8 z @xmath8 3.222 .",
    "our initial target list included 27 and 36 objects respectively , with ra between 21h and 5h .",
    "the combination of a narrow band filter ( ) at the wavelength of redshifted , and a wide filter ( ) to measure the continuum has been used by numerous authors to detect lecs ( see  @xcite , and references therein ) . by defining the zero point of the color index as that corresponding to pure continuum objects , any significant , positive color excess serves to identify lecs .",
    "that zero point is dependent on both the filters and the colors of the pure continuum objects .    to calculate the optimal filter combinations ,",
    "take @xmath14 as the flux distribution of a given object , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 the filter transmission functions in the wide and narrow filters respectively .",
    "the color index is given by    @xmath17    for a pure , flat continuum object , is obviously zero .",
    "for some fixed , non - flat continuum , the value of will be at its minimum when both filters are centered at the same wavelength .",
    "therefore , to minimize color effects , we choose filter sets such that the narrow one is always contained in the broad one ( see table  [ filters ] ) .    with the above definition of , an object with emission lines in the redshift range surveyed by the narrow filter ( approximately given by its fwhm )",
    "would have a positive color index .",
    "and all the objects with emission lines within the range of the broad filter , but out of the narrow one , would produce a negative color index .",
    "in fact , the presence of absorption lines would produce the opposite effect .",
    "however , to produce a significantly positive color index , that absorption in the wide filter should be very strong to compensate for the width of the filter .    to illustrate the expected colors , we present in figure  [ simul_30_80 ] the results of color simulations carried out for one of the filter combinations .",
    "notice that other than the zero - color sequence produced by the pure continuum objects in the field , there is a second quasi - sequence , with a negative color index .",
    "this is due to objects with emission lines out of the range of the narrow filter , but within the broad one .",
    "the shape of the sequence depends on the shape of the broad band filter . if the filter is a top - hat shaped filter the effect of the emission line is almost independent of its position within the filter , except when near to the edges .",
    "simulations also show how color indices are distributed .",
    "it is clear that the precise value of the color index will depend , other than on the redshift and the strength of the line , on its fwhm . when the emission line is broader than the narrow filter , the color index is smaller .",
    "when looking for qso - candidates , one potential problem is the misidentification of stars as qsos .",
    "depending on the filters and the spectral type , a star can produce a positive color index that could be misclassified as a @xmath1 quasar candidate . in order to estimate the number of misidentifications we have calculated the index for different types of stars using two spectral libraries ( @xcite ;  @xcite ) .",
    "these libraries include spectral classes from o to m , and luminosity classes from iii to v. the results are illustrated in figure  [ starcolor ] , which shows that the stellar colors are well grouped around zero , and that a strict upper limit can be defined .",
    "another consideration is that some real qsos may be lost if they do nt produce a high enough color index .",
    "indeed , a emission qso can produce a zero or even negative color index depending upon its characteristics and the precise position of the line in the spectral region covered by the filters .",
    "in fact , some of our target qsos do have such color indices .",
    "examination of their spectra shows that in most cases this is due to the presence of a strong absorption in the region of the line .",
    "it appears that these types of losses can be as high as @xmath18 when the filter combination @xmath19 is used , whereas it is only @xmath20 for the @xmath21 $ ] combination . for the other filter combinations the losses are negligible .",
    "although not a serious problem , other emission line objects or qsos at other redshifts can be confusing when lines other than fall in the region covered by the narrow band filter . for unresolved candidates , a first approximation to the contamination effect can be estimated using the 2qz catalog .",
    "we give in table [ lowerz ] the redshift range and the lines that could produce color indices that mimic those of a z = 3 qso . from the same 2qz catalog we find that the number of qsos in the other redshift ranges amounts to about 4 per square degree , down to the catalogue limit of b@xmath321 .",
    "therefore , contamination by bright qsos should not be a problem , with only 1 or 2 expected in our field of view .",
    "given the magnitude limit of our survey , and assuming an homogeneous distribution of qsos , a total of at about 8 qsos at redshifts different from the central one would be expected in our case .",
    "as discussed before , some candidates can go undetected depending on different aspects and , therefore , those numbers should be considered as upper limits .",
    "all in all , it is unlikely that our list of point - like candidates could be heavily contaminated by stars or by bright qsos at a different redshift , even if the contamination by fainter qsos could be sizable .",
    "it is also possible that some unresolved hii galaxies at z@xmath40.3 could be falsely identified as qso candidates .",
    "this effect can not be properly estimated since very little is known about the distribution of compact hii galaxies .",
    "the situation is different for resolved candidates , since the effect of the [ oii ] line of faint hii galaxies at z@xmath40.3 could be mistaken as due to lecs .",
    "we will discuss further this aspect below .",
    "observations were performed with fors1 at antu vlt on the nights of 22 and 23 october , 2000 .",
    "observing conditions were clear and photometric with seeing between 04 and 10 .",
    "the ccd camera at fors1 has a pixel size of 02/pix , giving a total field of view of 66@xmath2266 . for each qso we acquired images with a narrow band filter covering the wavelength of the redshifted line , as well as a broader band filter to get the color index .",
    "we exposed @xmath23 seconds with the broad band filters ( _ special 485 _",
    "( @xmath24 ) and g - gunn respectively ) and @xmath25 seconds with the narrow band filters ( heii  472.6 , heii   478.1 , [ oiii ]  500.1 , [ oiii ]  504.5 , [ oiii ]  510.5 ) .",
    "landolt standard stars were observed at various air masses to calibrate the data .",
    "extinction terms and their uncertainties are presented in table  [ filters ] . in 2 nights at the vlt",
    "we observed 47 fields , i.e. a number of objects large enough to allow a meaningful statistical analysis .",
    "image detection , photometry and classification were performed using the source extractor ( sextractor ) software program @xcite .",
    "image analysis proceeded as follows : ccd images were sectioned in sub - areas of @xmath26 pixels .",
    "a background map was constructed .",
    "the local background histogram was clipped iteratively until convergence at @xmath27 was reached .",
    "these raw background values were then filtered using a median filter ( in 3@xmath223 sub - areas ) , and a bi - cubic - spline was used to obtain the resulting background map .",
    "the background map was then subtracted from the image .",
    "all objects with a threshold @xmath28 1.5@xmath29 above the sky level , and with a minimum area of 5 pix@xmath30 were selected and extracted .",
    "their total magnitudes were calculated by integrating the intensity within elliptical apertures . finally , the star / galaxy classification ( non - resolved / resolved objects ) was done with a neural network routine developed by @xcite .",
    "this is a training program that classifies objects with an index ( stellarity index ) between 0 ( galaxies ) , and 1 ( stars ) .",
    "it uses eight isophotal areas , the peak intensity , and the seeing information to classify the objects .",
    "all the objects that sextractor had no problem with their photometry ( i.e. sextractor s flag @xmath31 ) were selected .",
    "the zero point of the broad band magnitudes was set to 27 , which results in qsos magnitudes close to their catalog v magnitudes .",
    "the color index zero point was set after examining the resulting color - magnitude diagrams , as corresponding to the sequence seen in the simulations .",
    "the threshold to accept the color index of a non resolved candidate as positive was established after considering two effects .",
    "first , we took into account the width of the band defined by the stellar colors .",
    "they are different for the different filter combinations : 0.15 mag for the f485-heii/3000 set , 0.10 for f485-heii/6500 , gunn  g-[oiii]/50 and gunn  g-[oiii]/3000 sets ; and 0.05 for the gunn  g-[oiii]/6000 set .",
    "second are the observational errors",
    ". there are well defined trends of errors with the broad - band magnitude , with 1@xmath29 errors of 0.18  mag at = 23.5 .",
    "we decide however to use the error of each individual object .",
    "the reason is that , for a given flux in the broad filter , the lecs will have in the narrow filter a higher signal than the non emitting objects .",
    "thus , adopting instead the average error trend would penalize the detection of lecs .",
    "unresolved objects were finally flagged as lecs when their color index exceeded the sum of the corresponding width of the stellar sequence , and 3.5 times the error of their index .",
    "resolved objects were considered as candidates when their color indices exceeded than 5 times the error in their measured color .",
    "long slit observations of 12 qso candidates were carried out on 3 nights in september 2002 , using ldss2 on the baade telescope at the las campanas observatory .",
    "the slit width was 1and the ccd pixel size was @xmath32 .",
    "the slit was aligned along the line connecting either two member candidates or a candidate and the central qso .",
    "exposure times ranged from 1800 to 3600 seconds .",
    "the data were taken in non photometric weather and the seeing varied from 06 to 14 .",
    "the spectra were reduced with iraf .",
    "the data were first bias subtracted and flat - fielded .",
    "sky removal was done by subtraction of sections adjacent to the spectrum in the slit .",
    "wavelength solutions were calculated from helium - argon arc lamp exposures .",
    "the rms fit of the arc lines given by iraf is @xmath33 while using a @xmath34 order polynomial to fit approximately 25 lines .",
    "the wavelength coverage is approximately @xmath35 to @xmath36 with a linear reciprocal dispersion of @xmath37 .",
    "cosmic rays were removed via the cosmicray routine .",
    "figure  [ colormg1 ] shows the color index the broad - band magnitude , , and figure  [ colormg2 ] gives the detection threshold , ( -3.5@xmath29 ) , _ versus _ .",
    "we have plotted together all the fields observed with the same filter combination . as discussed in the previous sections ,",
    "is positive for objects with some emission line lying within the narrow band filter , and negative when an emission line falls in the broad band filter . from the previous considerations , all objects with over the defined threshold",
    "are lecs in the redshift range determined by the width of the narrow band filter .",
    "the unresolved lecs are qso candidates at the same redshift of the central qso .",
    "resolved objects could be galaxies at the central qso redshift .",
    "the images of all the lecs were visually inspected on the processed images .",
    "if the object presented distortions , or if it was too close to the edge of the frame , or if a nearby object might be affecting the photometry , then it was eliminated from the list of candidates .    adopting a flat cosmological model with h@xmath38 = 70  , @xmath39 = 0.3 , @xmath40 = 0.7 , the size of the field covered by our frames corresponds to 12.2@xmath2212.2 mpc@xmath41 , comoving size , , about 1.5 times the clustering scale length of qsos found by @xcite . in the radial direction , the redshift range covered by",
    "each of our narrow band filters translates into @xmath350 mpc .",
    "the main results concerning unresolved lecs , are presented in tables  [ companions ] ,  [ stat_qsos ] , and  [ statfield_qsos ] .",
    "we found a total of 13 qso - like lecs in 11 fields . in two fields ( # 14 and # 43 )",
    "there are two candidates .",
    "as we already argued , this is a lower limit to the number of candidates .",
    "it is interesting to note that those companions have broad - band magnitudes significantly fainter than the central qso .",
    "therefore , if there is some grouping of qsos at high redshift , the members have significantly different luminosities .",
    "we have also considered the spatial distribution of the qso - candidates around the central qso . in figure  [ radialdist ]",
    "we present the cumulative , normalized distribution of the radial distances from the qso - candidates to the targets for each set of filters . given the small number of candidates no firm conclusion can be extracted ; however , the candidates appear to be closer than would be expected for a random distribution .",
    "spectra for 12 of the 13 qso candidates and 5 central qsos were obtained , although one candidate turned out to be a ccd cosmetic defect .",
    "after extraction , wavelength reduction and flux calibration , we proceeded to classify the spectra and measure redshifts .",
    "the resulting spectra are presented in figures  [ spec1 ] ,  [ spec2 ] and [ spec3 ] and their classification are listed in table  [ spec - class ] .    as a result ,",
    "5 out of 12 candidates show ly@xmath42 in the narrow band filter , therefore , these are qsos at the central qso redshift .",
    "thus , as argued before , a minimum of 10% of the surveyed z@xmath33 qsos have companions at the same redshift and , therefore , pairing of qsos at high redshift would be not infrequent .",
    "four of the other candidates are also qsos , but at different redshifts .",
    "two in the field of the qso # 14 have very similar spectra and could be a lensed pair .",
    "two unresolved candidates turned out to be faint hii galaxies at z@xmath30.3 .",
    "the last candidate spectrum has too low signal to noise ratio for a proper classification .",
    "although our main interest was the clustering of qsos , we have also found a number of resolved lecs .",
    "tables [ stat_res ] and [ statfieldres ] list the main results determined from the 96 resolved lecs in 34 fields .",
    "these data shows that the number of candidates brighter than m = 23.5 is much higher than expected from the measured luminosity function ( lf ) of break galaxies ( lbg ) at z@xmath43 (  @xcite ) .",
    "this excess become even more significant when one takes into account that the number of lecs found represent only a small fraction ( 20% ) of the lbgs that would also be emitters .",
    "the most plausible explanation is that most , or even all , of those objects are galaxies at z@xmath4 0.3 , with the [ oii ] line falling in the narrow band window .",
    "many of these objects are in fact just barely resolved , probably corresponding to hii galaxies which have a characteristic faint continuum with prominent emission lines ( see  @xcite ) . the [ oii ] line is narrow and intense in those objects",
    ". essentially all the objects with an [ oii ] ew over 60   , the median value for the galaxies in terlevich et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , would be detected as candidates .",
    "moreover , four of the bright lecs are found grouped in a field , at the position of a known radio galaxy ( nvss - j104545 - 012252 ) , with which they could define a cluster at redshift @xmath4 0.3 .    in the range 23.5 @xmath8 m",
    "@xmath8 25 , the expected number of emitters is close to what we have found .",
    "therefore it does nt seem that there is a significant overdensity of emitters around qsos , in that magnitude range .",
    "fynbo et al ( 2001 ) have suggested that there may be an excess of fainter emitters around some qsos , however , we can not address this issue given the magnitude limit of our survey .",
    "figure  [ radialdist ] shows the radial distribution of all the resolved candidates .",
    "this distribution is not far from what would be expected for a random distribution .",
    "when only the faint candidates are taken into account , the result is even closer to the expectation for a random distribution .",
    "we have explored the use of narrow band filters together with broad band filters to detect emitters around 47 known qsos .    for unresolved candidates we studied possible contamination from stars by simulating colors from stellar spectral libraries covering a wide range of spectral types and luminosities .",
    "contamination by objects with emission lines at redshifts @xmath43 was also analyzed .    as a result of the survey we found a total of 13 unresolved lecs in 11 fields .",
    "the possible companions to the targeted z@xmath43 qsos are systematically fainter , with only 2 objects within 2 magnitudes of the central qso .",
    "the selection criterion make it very unlikely the these objects are stellar contaminants .",
    "moreover , from the 2qz catalog we find that contamination by brighter than b = 21 mag qsos at a different z , but with strong lines entering the narrow filter , is very small ; none of our candidates are brighter than this limit .",
    "\\(i ) given the _",
    "angular size - redshift_t relation , for the geometry we use in this paper , the scale at @xmath44 is 7.7 kpc/. thus 04 - 08 corresponds to linear sizes in the range between 3 and 6 kpc . at these scales ,",
    "only very small or extremely nucleated galaxies would appear as unresolved .",
    "( ii)at @xmath1 and @xmath45 , the number of galaxies is very small . as a rough estimate we use the  @xcite luminosity function to calculate the number of ly - break galaxies at z = 3 . assuming that 20% are emission line galaxies , given our geometry and a @xmath46 volume",
    ", we expect 0.0002 ( @xmath47 ) , 1.4 ( @xmath48 ) , 5.1 ( @xmath49 ) and 18.5 ( @xmath50 ) ly - break emission galaxies . however , we find 7 , 11 , 12 and 13 unresolved objects respectively .",
    "our photometric bandpass is different , but this should not significantly affect these calculations . therefore our results show a clear excess of unresolved bright objects .",
    "the spectroscopic data confirm that 9 of our 12 candidates are qsos , 5 of them at the redshift of the target qso , at z@xmath3 3 . from the 2qz catalog we find that only a very tiny fraction of qsos have a companion in a volume similar to that of our survey .",
    "due to the lack of data it is hard to extend the analysis to fainter magnitude limits .",
    "nevertheless , starting form the luminosity function of faint agns given by pei ( 1995 , see their fig .",
    "8) , it is possible to deduce that in the range @xmath51 , there are @xmath52 objects @xmath53 at @xmath54 , and @xmath55 objects @xmath53 at @xmath56 .",
    "the redshift range covered in our survey is 0.05 , which is @xmath3 1/22 of pei s range . for the area covered by our survey , the expectations",
    "would then be @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and we find 0 and 3 respectively . by extrapolating pei s curve and integrating between 22 and 24 , we would expect 2.75 qsos , and we have found 5 . taking into account the preceding numbers and the possibility to have lost other candidates , as previously discussed , we can conclude that our findings indicate an excess of qsos around qsos at z@xmath33 .",
    "the spectroscopic results confirm the reliability of our photometric technique to detect qso companions .",
    "nearly half of the candidates have been confirmed as qsos at the same redshift of the central object , and none were found to be stars .",
    "our search has also produced a number of resolved lecs .",
    "we argue that the majority with m@xmath823.5 are probably galaxies with [ oii ] emission at z@xmath4 0.3 , many of them being hii galaxies .",
    "in particular , 4 of the resolved lecs appear grouped in one field , close to a known radio galaxy ( nvss - j104545 - 012252 ) , and could be part of a larger group at that redshift .",
    "the density of resolved lecs in the range 23.5 @xmath8 m @xmath8 25 is close to the expectations from the lf given by  @xcite for lbg , provided that about 20% of them are also emitters , as pointed out by  @xcite .",
    "the radial distribution of detected lecs around the target qsos is very close what would be expected for a random distribution .",
