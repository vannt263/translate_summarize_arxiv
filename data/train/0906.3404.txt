    "adult brain nuclei are considered after their final development , as part of information processing pathways .",
    "experiments on the topology of brain regions suggest that these structures can be categorized as heterogeneous media .",
    "there are various mathematical methods describing dynamical processes in heterogeneous media , such as asymptotic analysis , homogenization , and integral equations ( pavliotis and stuart @xcite , haken @xcite , e and engquist @xcite , levin and chao@xcite ) .",

    "these studies concentrate merely on the network structure of a particular brain region e.g. striatum and even then do not contain some important features such as the role of large spiny neurons in the striatal function .",

    "simplified but essential physiological processes have been chosen as the biological foundation for the mathematical model .",
    "the reader is advised to consider the appendix for a brief introduction into the biological terminology .",
    "the course of information processing in brain regions depends on the propagation of synaptic potentials - which are averaged postsynaptic potentials - along the subnetworks of these regions .",
    "thus , understanding the physiology of this integration process requires the comprehension of the neuronal architecture of the brain region of interest .",
    "the regional subnetworks consist of different types of neurons and characteristic connections among them that can be obtained by experiments . in this study the intraneuronal connections are subdivided into the global , and ultrastructural morphology .",
    "golgi and immunohistochemical methods provide optimal frameworks for obtaining the values of the two morphological dimensions experimentally .",
    "the immunohistochemical studies reveal the appearance of certain neurotransmitter systems in a structure ; golgi studies provide information about the form and type of neurons expressing the obtained neurotransmitter systems and on the morphological dimensions of the brain region in terms of the characteristic connections between different types of neurons in a brain region . in general , the structural topology of the brain region is then obtained .",
    "the knowledge about the appearance of different types of neurons and the intraneuronal synaptic interactions inside a nucleus allow us to abstract its structure through networks .",
    "one way of representing such networks is through their realization in continuous spaces .",
    "the attendance of a high amount of neurons supports the idea of the appropriateness of such an approach for this purpose .    because of the importance of the global and ultrastructural morphology for the information integration process in a nucleus and the dependency of their values on the spatial distribution of neurons",
    ", they shall be modelled as spatial variables parametrized by the neuron ( neurotransmitter ) type .    to provide a general framework for the regional neuronal activity",
    ", we introduce an integral operator averaging the information on two refinement scales .",
    "the idea is to cover the space including the nucleus with copies of discrete fundamental domains consisting of neuronal assemblies which we call n - cells .",
    "roughly spoken , n - cell patches are finite networks of neurons .",
    "the ultrastructural morphology of a nucleus in terms of the synaptic connectivities between different neurons provides information on the local connectivities in the n - cells , which are embedded as edges of neuronal network inside the n - cells . within the information on the adherence functions of n - cells ( global morphology variables ) and the distribution of neurons ,",
    "the averaging of synaptic potentials across the network of nuclei is completed .",
    "the main advantage of this method is in its appropriateness for applications on various brain regions .    assembling a suitable number of n - cells by considering the large - scale interaction between the n - cells ( adherence of n - cells )",
    ", we obtain information on the combined influence of several synaptic inputs on macroscopic neuronal activity ( fig .",

    "one trivial example is the subthalamic nucleus which consists of only one class of interneurons . in this case",
    "the number of n - cells under consideration is one ( parent and parent @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this study is to present a mathematical technique for averaging microscopic information along complex network structures such as the networks of single brain regions .",
    "the technique is applied on the corpus striatum - a part of the basal ganglia circuit which plays an important role in the regulation of motor behaviour- and shown to mimic faithfully the qualitative oscillatory behaviour of this brain region .",
    "the general formulation of the averaging operator suggest its suitability for other discrete multiscale problems , especially in the research area of material sciences .",

    "the n - cells compose the whole brain region of interest by applying the global morphological properties and contain the local morphological properties as finite graphs .",
    "hence , they unify the morphological dimensions into one notion .    * definition 1 : * a n - cell is a neuronal assembly represented by a finite graph characterized by the local ultrastructural morphology . within proper composition of the n - cells , as discrete fundamental domains , they patch up the region of interest .",

    "the corpus striatum is used as an non - trivial example to illustrate the efficiency of the averaging operator method .",
    "the complexity of the striatal structure on the one hand , and the importance of this brain region as a substrate of the basal ganglia in the regulation of motor activity and neurological diseases on the other hand , make it a proper representative for such investigations .",

    "then , the simulation results are discussed and compared with the experiments .    a category of proper experiments for the validation of the numerical results is represented by the local field potential ( lfp ) studies .",
    "thereby , a signal is recorded using a low impedance extracellular microelectrode , placed sufficiently far from individual local neurons to prevent any particular cell from dominating the electrophysiological signal .",
    "this signal is then low - pass filtered , cut off at @xmath28 , to obtain the local field potential ( lfp ) .",
    "the low impedance and positioning of the electrode allows the activity of a large number of neurons to contribute to the signal .",

    "will then be compared with those appeared as the results of the numerical simulation of the averaging transformation by given morphological properties .",
    "the neuronal populations of the striatum could be divided into four classes : spiny projection neurons ( about @xmath30 of the whole neural population ) are gabaergic neurons , which get external inputs from cortical areas , thalamus and substantia nigra pars compacta ( smith et al .",
    "these neurons also get inputs from the dopaminergic , gabaergic and acetylcholinergic interneurons .",
    "large aspiny neurons ( cholinergic ) , gabaergic interneurons and dopaminergic neurons comprise the rest population of striatal neurons .",
    "the cholinergic interneurons get external inputs from thalamus and substantia nigra pars compacta ; and internal inputs from the gabaergic interneurons .",
    "they project to the dopaminergic and projection neurons . the action of the cholinergic interneurons is assumed to have opposite effects on the action of the dopaminergic neurons on the whole network .",
