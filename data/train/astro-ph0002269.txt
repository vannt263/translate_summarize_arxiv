    "there is currently a growing interest in the acceleration of non  thermal particles at highly relativistic shocks .",
    "there are three classes of _ bona fide _ relativistic sources : beyond the well  established extra ",
    "galactic ( blazars ) and galactic ( superluminal ) sources , both of which exhibit superluminal motions , it is now also well - established that gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) display highly relativistic expansions , with lorentz factors well in excess of @xmath3 .",
    "other classes of relativistic sources may include soft gamma ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , whose recurrent explosions are largely super  eddington , and special sne similar to sn 1998bw , which displayed marginally newtonian expansion ( @xmath4 ) when optical emission lines became detectable , about a month after the explosion .    with the discovery of grbs afterglows ,",
    "it has now become feasible to derive the energy spectral index @xmath2 of electrons accelerated at the forward shock , as a function of the varying ( decreasing ) shock lorentz factor @xmath5 , provided simultaneous wide  band spectral coverage is available . with the launch of the usa / italy / uk mission swift",
    ", these data will become available for a statistically significant number of bursts , testing directly models for particle acceleration at relativistic shocks .",
    "furthermore , since grbs must also clearly accelerate protons , the same index @xmath2 may determine the spectrum of ultra high energy cosmic rays observed at earth .",
    "however , until recently , both the lack of astrophysical motivation and the difficulty inherent in treating highly anisotropic distribution functions have stiffened research on this topic . early work , both semi  analytic and outright numerical , has concentrated on barely relativistic flows with lorentz factors of a few , well suited to blazars and galactic superluminals , but clearly insufficent for grbs , the only exception being the numerical simulations of bednarz and ostrowski ( 1998 ) .",
    "it is the purpose of this _ letter _ to perform an analytic investigation of the large @xmath5 limit , to establish which ( if any ) of the properties of the particles distribution function depend upon the physical conditions of the fluid .",
    "i deal first with pure pitch angle scattering , and then ( subsection 2.3 ) i discuss oblique shocks . in the well  known equation for the particles distribution function , under the assumption of pure pitch angle scattering , @xmath6 @xmath7",
    "is computed in the shock frame , in which are also defined the distance from the shock @xmath8 , the fluid speed in units of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and fluid lorentz factor @xmath5 . instead , the scattering coefficient @xmath11 , particle momentum @xmath12 and particle pitch angle cosine , @xmath13 , are all defined in the local fluid frame .",
    "i make no hypothesis whatsoever about @xmath11 , except that it is positive definite and smooth .",
    "we place ourselves in the shock frame , and call @xmath14 the shock position ; the upstream section is for @xmath15 , so that the fluid speeds are both @xmath16 .",
    "the above equation admits of an integral : by integrating over @xmath13 and @xmath8 we see that @xmath17 independent of @xmath8 . the required boundary condition for @xmath7 , ,",
    "that @xmath18 as @xmath19 , implies that the constant , upstream , is @xmath20 .",
    "downstream , eq . [ conserved1 ] is also a constant , but , because of taub s jump conditions , it is not the same constant as upstream .",
    "since the required boundary condition for @xmath7 far downstream ( @xmath21 ) is that it becomes isotropic and @xmath7 is a relativistic invariant , we see that , far downstream , @xmath22 . we thus have @xmath23 where the inequality in eq .",
    "[ conserved2]b ( which will become necessary later on ) derives from the obvious constraint @xmath24 .",
    "i begin the analysis by considering eq .",
    "[ conserved2]a in the limit of very large shock lorentz factors , in which case , upstream , @xmath25 . for @xmath26 ,",
    "this reduces to @xmath27 since @xmath28 everywhere in the integration interval except of course at @xmath29 , and since @xmath30 we see that , for @xmath31 we must have @xmath32 where @xmath33 is dirac s delta .",
    "thus , in this limit , the angular dependence factors out . for reasons to be explained in the next subsection , we shall also need @xmath7 for @xmath34 , but still @xmath35 . to search for such a solution",
    ", we let ourselves be guided by the solution at @xmath36 : thus , we let the angular dependence factor out , and use the _ ansatz _ @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 is an as yet undetermined function of the pre  shock fluid speed such that @xmath39 as @xmath25 . in this way ,",
    "as the speed grows , the angular dependence becomes more and more concentrated toward @xmath29 , as required by the previously found solution for @xmath31 .",
    "introducing our _ ansatz _ into eq .",
    "[ main ] i find @xmath40 where i defined @xmath41 , and i factored the eigenvalue for future convenience . concentrating on the angular part , and defining @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 ,",
    "i find @xmath45 we are interested in a solution of the above equation only in the limit @xmath46 , the only one in which our factored _ ansatz",
    "_ is a good approximation to the true @xmath7 . in this case , the term @xmath47 is clearly subdominant , and can be neglected in a first approximation ( this technique is called dominant balance , bender and orszag 1978 ) .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath46 , we expect @xmath48 to be more and more concentrated around @xmath29 , so that in this range we can approximate the term @xmath49 , and i obtain @xmath50 with obvious solution @xmath51 .",
    "the factor @xmath52 can be determined by inserting this approximate expression for @xmath53 into eq .",
    "[ conserved2]a . a trivial computation yields @xmath54 .",
    "now , going back to the equation for @xmath55 , the spatial part of @xmath7 , we find , also using the above , @xmath56 from which , in the end , i find an approximate solution for the distribution function in the limit @xmath57 : @xmath58 it is thus seen that the detailed shape of the pitch angle scattering function @xmath59 is irrelevant , and that what is left of it ( its value @xmath60 at @xmath29 ) only enters the spatial part of the distribution function @xmath7 , not the angular one .",
    "we make here the usual assumption , that the distribution function depends upon the particle momentum @xmath12 as @xmath61 in either frame ( but see the discussion for further comments ) . from the condition of continuity of the distribution function at the shock , denoting as @xmath62 and @xmath63 the particle s momentum and cosine of the pitch angle in the downstream frame , we have @xmath64 where the irrelevant constant of proportionality does not depend on @xmath65 . using the lorentz transformations to relate @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 the relative speed and corresponding lorentz factor between the upstream and downstream fluids ) ,",
    "i find @xmath71 for @xmath25 , it is easy to derive from taub s conditions ( landau and lifshitz 1987 ) that @xmath72 , and that @xmath73 .",
    "this result does use a post  shock equation of state @xmath74 , which is surely correct in the limit @xmath75 . in the end , i obtain @xmath76 this equation shows why we needed to determine the pitch angle distribution , in the upstream frame , even for @xmath77 : in fact , even though the angular distribution in the upstream frame ( eq . [ up ] ) tends to a singularity , the downstream distribution does not ( because the factor @xmath78 has a finite , non  zero limit ) , and the concrete form to which it tends depends upon the departures of the upstream distribution from a dirac s delta .    from now on",
    "i will drop the subscript @xmath79 in @xmath63 , since all quantities refer to downstream . in order to determine @xmath80",
    ", we now appeal to a necessary regularity condition which must be obeyed by the initial ( , for @xmath81 ) pitch angle distribution , eq .",
    "[ incomplete ] .",
    "looking at eq .",
    "[ main ] specialized to the downstream case , where @xmath82 for very fast shocks , we see that this equation has a singularity at @xmath83 .",
    "passing through this singularity will fix the index @xmath80 .",
    "it is not convenient to use @xmath7 directly ; rather , i use its laplace transform @xmath84 taking laplace transforms of both sides of eq .",
    "[ main ] i obtain @xmath85    i am interested in the limit @xmath86 . in fact , here i can use two results .",
    "first , in this limit , it is well  known ( watson s lemma , bender and orszag 1978 ) that eq .",
    "[ laplace ] reduces to @xmath87 despite this wonderful result in all its generality , i will actually use it only in the neighborhood of @xmath83 ; here , eq .",
    "[ transformed2 ] takes on a simple form : defining @xmath88 , @xmath89 where i defined @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "now i make the _ ansatz _ ( to be checked _ a posteriori _ ) that the term @xmath93 is negligible compared to the second order derivative in the limit @xmath94 .",
    "i am interested only in the most significant term in @xmath95 , since eq .",
    "[ watson ] was only obtained to this order .",
    "then , the equation [ localized ] becomes @xmath96 the above equation is the prototype of the one  turning point problem .",
    "its solution , strictly in the neighborhood of the point @xmath97 , is ( bender and orszag 1978 , sect .",
    "10.4 , eq .",
    "10.4.13b ) : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is an arbitrary constant , and @xmath100 is one of airy s functions . from this",
    "it can easily be checked that our _ ansatz _ was justified .    clearly , close to the point @xmath97 , eq .",
    "[ watson ] and eq .",
    "[ airy ] must give the same results .",
    "thus i find that , close to @xmath83 , @xmath101 which solves our problem : from this in fact we see that , since @xmath102 by definition , and thus @xmath103 in @xmath104 , then we must have @xmath105 this is our sought for extra condition for @xmath80 ; we have seen that it comes directly from demanding that the boundary condition of the problem , eq .",
    "[ incomplete ] , manages to pass through the singular point of eq .",
    "[ main ] , which i showed to be a conventional one  turning point problem familiar from elementary quantum mechanics .    by substituting into eq .",
    "[ incomplete ] i find @xmath106    from which we obtain @xmath107 .",
    "the solution with the minus sign is unacceptable : in fact , if we plug eq .",
    "[ incomplete ] into the conservation equation [ conserved1 ] , we see ( fig .",
    "1 ) that for @xmath108 the integral is @xmath109 .",
    "we remarked after eq .",
    "[ conserved2]b , however , that this integral had necessarily to be @xmath16 , so that we may conclude that @xmath110 is an absolute lower limit to @xmath80 .",
    "thus we discard the solution with the minus sign , and are left with the unique solution @xmath111      let us call @xmath112 the angle that the magnetic field makes with the shock normal , in the upstream fluid",
    ". then shocks can be classified as either subluminal or superluminal , depending upon whether , upstream , @xmath113 or @xmath114 , respectively ( de hoffmann and teller 1950 ) .",
    "we are interested in the limit @xmath57 , so that most shocks will be of the superluminal type . in this case , we could ( but we wo nt ) move to a frame where the magnetic field is parallel to the shock surface , both upstream and downstream . however , downstream this extremely orderly field configuration appears more idealized than warranted by physical reality and observations .",
    "in fact , behind a relativistic shock , a large number of processes ( compression , shearing , turbulent dynamo , parker instability , two  stream instability ) can generate magnetic fields ; furthermore , there is no obvious reason why these fields should have large coherence lengths . in grbs",
    ", a large number of observations of different afterglows supports this picture , the most detailed of all being those of grb 970508 , extending from a few hours to @xmath115 after the burst ( waxman , frail and kulkarni 1998 ; frail , waxman and kulkarni 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "accurate and successful modeling fixes the post  shock ratio of magnetic to non ",
    "magnetic energy densities to @xmath116 .",
    "notice that here the protons rest mass is not even the largest contribution to the non ",
    "magnetic energy density !",
    "polarization measurements also support , albeit less cogently , the idea of a small coherence length : of the four bursts observed so far , only one has a detected polarization , at the @xmath117 level ( grb 990510 , covino , 1999 ) .",
    "thus the most plausible physical model downstream , is that particles move in a locally generated turbulent , dynamically negligible magnetic field ; if then we call @xmath118 the average post  shock field coherence length , and restrict our attention to particles with sufficiently large energies ( , with gyroradii @xmath119 ) , we see there can be no reflection as particles approach the shock from downstream .",
    "it follows that we expect the situation downstream to be identical to that of pure pitch angle scattering .",
    "upstream , the parallel magnetic field is also irrelevant .",
    "in fact , backward deflection of a particle occurs on a length ",
    "scale @xmath120 , but backward diffusion of the particle by magnetic irregularities only requires the sideways deflection by an angle @xmath121 ( @xmath5 being the shock lorentz factor ) , for the shock to overrun the particle .",
    "this typically occurs on a length @xmath122 , with @xmath123 a few .",
    "so , as @xmath124 , the length ",
    "scale for scattering upstream by the magnetic field increases , while that by magnetic irregularities decreases : the field is irrelevant . in the end ,",
    "the same analysis as for pure pitch angle scattering applies , and the same index @xmath80 and pitch angle distributions at the shock follow .    in the case of subluminal shocks , a similar comment applies .",
    "downstream , we expect on a physical basis the same situation as for superluminal shocks .",
    "upstream , eq .",
    "[ main ] is replaced by ( kirk and heavens 1989 ) @xmath125 to which the same analysis as in subsection 2.1 can be applied .",
    "thus we find the same @xmath80 and pitch angle distributions at the shock as above .    as a corollary , it may be noticed that the above argument also implies that the results above are independent of the ratio @xmath126 , the cross  field and parallel diffusion coefficients .",
    "for ultrarelativistic particles the energy spectral index @xmath2 is related to @xmath80 by @xmath127    which is our final result .",
    "also , now that we know @xmath80 , the final pitch angle distribution at the shock , but downstream , can be determined ( eq .",
    "[ incomplete ] ) , and is plotted in fig .",
    "none of these results depends upon the specific form of @xmath59 , so that widely differing assumptions should yield precisely the same results .",
    "how does this compare with numerical work ?",
    "the near  constancy of the index @xmath80 ( or @xmath2 ) explains moderately well the results of previous authors : kirk and schneider ( 1987 ) find @xmath128 for their computation with the highest speed , which is however a modest lorentz factor of @xmath129 , and a single functional dependence of @xmath11 on @xmath13 .",
    "heavens and drury ( 1988 ) find again a result of @xmath130 for equally modest lorentz factors , but for two different recipes for @xmath11 .",
    "extensive numerical computations using a montecarlo technique ( , totally independent of the validity of eq .",
    "[ main ] ) were performed by bednarz and ostrowski ( 1998 ) , for a wide variety of assumptions about the scattering properties of the fluids .",
    "they remarked quite explicitly that the energy spectral index @xmath2 seemed to converge to a constant value , independent of shock lorentz factor ( provided @xmath131 ) , magnetic field orientation angle @xmath112 , and diffusion coefficient ratio , @xmath126 .",
    "they found @xmath132 .",
    "the present work confirms ( for all untried forms for @xmath59 ) and extends their simulations ( by yielding the exact value , and explicit forms for the particle angular distributions ) .",
    "the upstream angular distributions also agree well : fig.3a of bednarz and ostrowski clearly shows that this is ( for the highest displayed value of @xmath133 ) a dirac s delta , in agreement with the large@xmath5 limit in section 2.1 .",
    "however , the downstream pitch angle distributions ( in their fig .",
    "3b ) agree well with mine , but not perfectly .",
    "gallant , achterberg and kirk ( 1998 ) have claimed that there is a small error in bednarz and ostrowksi s distributions . as a matter of fact ,",
    "my distribution ( fig .",
    "2 ) agrees much better with gallant s and kirk and schneider s ( 1987 ) than bednarz and ostrowski s , despite the very small shock lorentz factors of these two papers ( @xmath134 and @xmath129 , respectively ) .",
    "possibly , the small error in question may even explain the ( small ! ) discrepancy between the two values of @xmath2 .",
    "a limitation applies to the claim of universality of eqs .",
    "[ up ] , [ incomplete ] and [ final ] : i neglected any process altering the particles energy during the scattering .",
    "clearly , the results of this paper only apply in the limit @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the typical momentum transfer in each scattering event . in the large momentum limit considered here",
    ", it seems unlikely that this constraint may be violated .",
    "lastly , a comment on the assumed dependence @xmath137 of the distribution function upon particle momenta is in order .",
    "it can be seen from eq .",
    "[ main ] that such a dependence is _ not _ required by this equation . to see this ,",
    "let us make the usual assumption that @xmath11 is homogeneous of degree @xmath138 in @xmath12 , , @xmath139 .",
    "then by defining a new variable @xmath140 , we see that the form assumed by eq .",
    "[ main ] after this change of variable is identical to the original one , except that now @xmath12 has altogether disappeared . at large @xmath8 ( , far downstream ) , @xmath141 constant , and there is no @xmath12dependence .",
    "this paradox is solved by noticing that the real problem to be solved involves both scattering (= fermi acceleration ) and injection . in this case , a typical injection momentum @xmath142 arises naturally , and the dimensional problem discussed above is naturally solved : we must have @xmath143 where the dots indicate all other parameters . in the limit of @xmath144 , @xmath7 _ does not _",
    "tend to a constant independent of @xmath142 as is always assumed , but tends instead to zero as @xmath145 .",
    "problems of this sort , though rare in astrophysics , are common in hydrodynamics , where they are called self  similar problems of the second kind ( zeldovich 1956 ) .",
    "they range from the deceptively simple laminar flow of an ideal fluid plast an infinite wedge ( landau and lifshitz 1987 ) to the illuminating case of the filtration in an elasto  plastic porous medium ( barenblatt 1996 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that , in the problem at hand , no such complication is necessary to fix the all  important index @xmath80 , yet the powerful methods of intermediate asymptotics ( barenblatt 1996 ) and the renormalization group ( goldenfeld 1992 ) can be brought to bear on the intermediate @xmath5 cases , where no easy limiting solution can be found .    in short , what i have done in this paper",
    "is to show that the spectrum of non  thermal particles accelerated at relativistic shocks is universal , in the sense that the energy spectral index @xmath2 , and the angular distributions in both the upstream and downstream frames ( eqs . [ up ] , [ incomplete ] , [ final ] , and fig .",
    "2 ) do not depend upon the scattering function @xmath59 , the shock lorentz factor ( provided of course @xmath131 ) , the magnetic field geometry , and the ratio of cross  field to parallel diffusion coefficients.thus we have the result that the cosmic rays spectra are independent of flow details in both the newtonian ( bell 1978 ) and the relativistic regimes .",
