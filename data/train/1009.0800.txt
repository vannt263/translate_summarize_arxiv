    "density functional theory@xcite ( dft ) in various approximations to the unknown exchange correlation potential developed to the most important practical scheme to investigate or determine the electronic , structural and many other properties of molecules , solids , and materials in physics , chemistry , materials science , mineralogy and reaches now into new fields such biophysics and electro - chemistry .",
    "a typical trend observed is that we deal with increasingly more complex systems characterized by many atoms of different chemical nature in open structures and of low symmetry .",
    "this path is supported by the increasing availability of increasingly powerful computers spearheaded by high - performance computers .",
    "the developments of the latter show that we have to cope with massively parallel computer architectures dealing with thousands of cores .",
    "this path accelerates in the next 10 years with the attempt moving from peta - scale to exa - scale computing .",
    "thus , developing electronic structure methods whose applicability scales with the available processes becomes a prerequisite .",
    "the real - space scheme of first - principles calculations , in which all computations are implemented in real space , is a method that has the potential to scale with massively parallel architectures and has this potential without compromise on the precision and thus should be superior to conventional plane wave methods@xcite .",
    "real - space methods can be loosely categorized as one of three types : finite differences@xcite , finite elements@xcite , or wavelets@xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite have presented the real - space method combining the high - order finite - difference formula for the second derivative of the kohn - sham equation@xcite and the norm - conserving pseudopotential@xcite and demonstrated its applicability for the investigation of the cohesive energy and bond length of diatomic molecules . there",
    "exist alternative high - order discretizations such as the mehrstellen form used in the work of briggs _",
    "et al._@xcite several techniques to improve the precision and accelerate the computational speed have been proposed so far@xcite .",
    "further advantages of real - space finite - difference ( rsfd ) formalisms are that ( i ) the computational costs involved in calculating the projectors of pseudopotentials can be reduced when the calculations are implemented in real space .",
    "( ii ) since all of the calculations are carried out in real space , it is easy to incorporate wannier - type orbitals , which are localized in a finite region required for the realization of linear scaling calculations@xcite , into the algorithm .",
    "( iii ) the grid spacing should be narrowed in order to improve the calculational precision , a procedure , which is simple and definite , and ( iv ) boundary conditions are not constrained to be periodic , e.g. , combinations of periodic and nonperiodic boundary conditions for surfaces and wires , uneven boundary condition for triclinic systems , and twist boundary conditions for helical nanotubes are included straight forwardly@xcite",
    ". in particular point ( iv ) is of significant advantage for electron - transport calculations@xcite , because a nonperiodic boundary is indispensable for the direction in which electrons flow .",
    "norm - conserving pseudopotentials , which were introduced by hamann _",
    "et al._@xcite , have made significant contributions to the description of the band structure of semiconductors and simple metals and the computation of their bond lengths , crystal structures and surface reconstructions as well as vibrational modes of molecules@xcite .",
    "however , for systems with first - row elements or 3_d _ electrons , the norm - conserving pseudopotentials are very hard so that a large plane - wave basis set or an extremely small grid spacing is required . similarly , treating semicore states as valence states , which is often necessary for transition metals or compounds with light elements , e.g. , gan , results in hard pseudopotentials and affects their transferability . some of these problems can be avoided employing vanderbilt s ultrasoft pseudopotentials@xcite , which relax the norm - conservation condition and are now adopted quite widely .",
    "another alternatives is full - potential all - electron methods such as the korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr)-greenfunction@xcite or the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( flapw ) method@xcite .",
    "both methods provide the kohn - sham answer of the given exchange correlation function taken for the problem at hand and provide in addition a precise treatment of wave functions near the nuclei probed by several experimental techniques and can supply properties that are usually not provided by the conventional pseudopotential approach .",
    "these are , among many others , the hyperfine parameters and electric field gradients , but also correct magnetic structures .",
    "in particular , for simulations related to spintronics , the correct description of magnetism the precise treatment of the localized _",
    "d_-levels is of crucial importance .",
    "blchl@xcite proposed a state - of - the - art all - electron method , called the projector augmented - wave ( paw ) method , that retains the formal simplicity and practicability of the traditional pseudopotential approach , but matches the precision of the full - potential all - electron methods .",
    "mortensen _ et al._@xcite implemented the paw method into their rsfd computational code , grid - based projector augmented - wave ( gpaw ) code , and demonstrated that the code , in terms of computational efficiency , is comparable to a plane wave based paw ( pwpaw ) method by computing the bond length and atomization energy of small molecules consisting of first- and second - row elements .",
    "in addition , they claimed that the average difference of atomization energies of small molecules from the results obtained by other computational codes is 50 mev .",
    "however , the rsfd calculations have never been applied in simulations that require extremely high precision such as comparisons of small structural energy differences between different bulk phases of transition metals .",
    "for example , the difference of the cohesive energy between face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) cu and hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) cu is just 8 mev / atom according to the flapw calculation@xcite using the local density approximation@xcite and the required precision for the discussion of a pressure - induced phase transition for cupt from @xmath01@xmath1 to @xmath22 is less than 10 mev@xcite .    in the rsfd formalisms ,",
    "there is a well - known problem that the total energies and forces depend unphysically on the position of the nucleus relative to the positions of grid points , which is called the `` egg box effect . ''",
    "this problem is an obstacle to the precise computation of the total energies of systems containing transition metals with a moderate grid spacing .",
    "although , reliable results can be achieved using a very small grid spacing in the rsfd formalisms , one of the greatest benefits of the paw method , the precise treatment of transition metals with modest computational effort in cpu time and computer memory , will be lost and instead the computational cost is expected to increase substantially .",
    "furthermore , in the case of paw method , the grid spacing required for transition metals is smaller than that for first - row elements , while this relation is opposite in the case of the norm - conserving pseudopotentials .",
    "thus , the egg box effect is more severe for transition metals in the case of the paw method and it is of great importance to develop methods to circumvent the egg box effect .",
    "several prescriptions to deal with it have been proposed over time and their applications proved successful within the framework of norm - conserving pseudopotentials up to now@xcite . however , as far as we know , there are no reports on efficient techniques that allow us to perform extremely precise simulations such as examinations of small structural energy differences of transition metals with a moderate grid spacing .    in this paper",
    ", we present an efficient computational scheme with a high degree of precision within the framework of rsfd formalisms making use of the paw method to enable large - scale first - principles simulations for systems containing transition metals . by combining the advantage of the time - saving double - grid ( dg ) technique@xcite and fourier filtering ( ff ) procedure for projectors of pseudopotentials@xcite , we have succeeded to reduce the number of grid points employed in the calculations in the case of cu 75% compared to our previous procedure@xcite and the precision",
    "is improved . in order to demonstrate the performance of our scheme , we study the total - energy convergence with respect to the grid spacing and the energy variation due to the egg box effect .",
    "we also calculate the bulk properties of various 3@xmath3 transition metals and cu , as well as the structural energy differences between different bulk phases of those .",
    "we compare these results to present that this rsfd formalism is very precise and that the precision is comparable to those to in - house calculations using the vasp code@xcite , which bases on the pwpaw method , and the fleur code@xcite , which uses the flapw method@xcite .",
    "the advantage of the in - house comparison is that we can use the same exchange correlation potential and the same pseudopotential and can converge the properties in question individually to achieve an accurate comparison .",
    "this comparison shows that indeed the rsfd formalism in combination with the paw method is very precise and is able to achieve full - potential all - electron precision .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the trials for the egg box effect in the rsfd formalism and present our prescriptions to deal with this problem in detail .",
    "we introduce some examples to demonstrate the potential power of our scheme in sec .",
    "iii . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we conclude with a discussion on the future direction of the rsfd electronic - structure calculations .",
    "in the rsfd formalism , real - space grid points are distributed across the computational region in which the atoms are distributed and wave functions , electronic charge density , and potentials are all represented on the discrete grid points .",
    "the egg box effect describes the phenomenon that the total energies and forces are affected unphysically by the positions of the grid points relative to the nucleus , although their discretizations are not invariant under uniform translations of the system with respect to the position of the grid .",
    "this problem occurs also even in plane wave formalisms when the operations concerning the projectors of pseudopotentials are implemented in real space@xcite .",
    "although we can overcome the egg box effect by reducing the grid spacing , small grid spacings may require so many grid points as to result in a substantial increase in computational effort .",
    "it is known that the effect can be avoided by treating the projectors of pseudopotentials in fourier space following the operation in conventional plane wave formalisms . however , this procedure results in an increase of the computational costs from @xmath4 to @xmath5 and the degradation of the performance on massively parallel computers , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the numbers of atoms , occupied bands , and total grid points in the supercell , respectively .",
    "these procedures contradict an important demand in the simulations using paw pseudopotentials , i.e. , to perform very precise total energy calculations with a modest computational cost .",
    "several approaches for this effect have been proposed in the framework of norm - conserving pseudopotentials so far and they are categorized into two approaches .",
    "one is to directly modify the behavior of the pseudopotentials , which vary sharply in the vicinity of nuclei , by filtering procedures .",
    "king - smith _",
    "et al._@xcite were the first to introduce the careful treatment using the ff procedure for projectors of pseudopotentials in context of plane wave formalism , and several groups in quantum chemistry subsequently modified and/or simplified that filtering procedure by introducing mask functions@xcite .",
    "these mask functions are very easy to introduce into the computational codes , because one does not need to change the codes extensively .",
    "however , the modification of pseudopotentials seriously destroys the transferability , particularly , in the procedures using mask functions@xcite .",
    "the other approach is to reduce the grid spacing near the nuclei , and various attempts based on this approach have been made@xcite , one of which is the cpu time - saving dg technique@xcite . it is used to execute the integrals concerning the pseudopotentials on the denser grids without introducing any artificial parameter or increasing the computational costs during the self - consistency iterations , and have achieved considerable success in studying atomic configurations , electronic structures and transport properties of nanostructures@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dg technique can be incorporated with the filtering procedures mentioned above . in the following sections , we introduce the computational scheme combining the ff proposed by king - smith _ et al._@xcite and the dg technique@xcite to overcome the egg box effect in computations treating transition metals .",
    "computations concerning wave functions and nonlocal parts of pseudopotentials are usually implemented in electronic - structure calculations using a separable form , e.g. , using the procedure proposed by kleinman and bylander@xcite . following the notation of king - smith _ et al._@xcite , the real - space representation of a separable form",
    "may be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath6 are orbital and azimuthal angular momentum quantum numbers , respectively , @xmath11 is the spherical harmonic , @xmath12 is a radial projection function that vanishes outside the cutoff region of pseudopotentials ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is an angular momentum dependent energy , and @xmath15 is the index of the projectors . note that more than one projector for the same @xmath16 are employed to improve the transferability of pseudopotentials in some cases .",
    "both ff and dg exploit the fact , that the pseudo wave functions are considerably smoother than the projectors of the pseudopotential .",
    "if the inner products between wave functions and the projectors are calculated naively by evaluating the integrands on each grid point and summing up these values , the required grid spacing is determined by the shape of the projectors . but",
    "a significantly coarser grid is sufficient for the precise description of the smooth wave functions , and the inner product can be rewritten as a function of wave functions that needs to be evaluated only on that coarser grid .",
    "such a procedure can remarkably reduce the computational effort , as the operations involving the projectors but not the wave functions can be executed prior to the selfconsistency cycle . the remaining operations needed to determine the inner product",
    "are executed only for the coarse grid points .      in the case of ff ,",
    "the inner products between wave functions and the projectors are evaluated on a coarse grid after smoothening the projectors .",
    "this is done by transforming the projectors to fourier space and removing the fastest - varying components as the following procedure .",
    "@xmath12 is transformed to reciprocal space : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the spherical bessel function of order @xmath10 and @xmath10 corresponds to the orbital angular momentum of spherical harmonics .",
    "the modified pseudopotential functions are then transformed back to real space by fourier transform : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an additional term such that @xmath21 vanishes outside the sphere slightly larger than the cutoff region of pseudopotentials and @xmath22 is the plane wave cutoff , which normally corresponds to @xmath23 with @xmath24 being a real - space grid spacing so as to be equal to that of the plane wave calculation that uses a fourier transform grid with the same spacing as the rsfd calculation .",
    "we employ the original procedure proposed by king - smith _ et al._@xcite to set up @xmath20 , although many variations of the scheme have been proposed up to now@xcite .",
    "thus , the expectation value of the one - particle wave function @xmath25 with respect to the projectors of pseudopotential of atom @xmath26 is @xmath27 where @xmath28 $ ] are the projectors , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the position of the atom @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , this filtering procedure is also applicable to the local parts of pseudopotentials using the separation procedure of the local parts described in refs .   and .",
    "in the dg technique , the inner products are evaluated on a dense grid by interpolating the pseudo wave functions @xmath31 .",
    "since the interpolation scheme can be rewritten as a function of @xmath31 ( with @xmath31 given on a coarse grid ) , the integrations are carried out on a coarse grid without degrading the numerical precision .",
    "the dg employed here consists of two types of uniform and equi - distant grid points , i.e. , coarse and dense ones , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) by `` @xmath32 '' and `` @xmath33 '' , respectively .",
    "the dense - grid region enclosed by the circle is the core region of an atom that is taken to be large enough to contain the region in which the projectors do not vanish .",
    "we postulate here that pseudo wave functions are defined and updated only on coarse - grid points , while pseudopotentials are strictly given on all dense - grid points in an analytically or numerically exact manner .    '' and `` @xmath33 '' correspond to coarse- and dense - grid points , respectively .",
    "the circle shows the core region of an atom that is taken to be sufficiently large to contain the region in which the projectors are non - zero .",
    "( b ) wave function @xmath34 and pseudopotential projector @xmath35 on coarse- and dense - grid points in the one - dimensional case . @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) represents a coarse- ( dense- ) grid point with @xmath38 @xmath39 , and hence @xmath40 . ]",
    "let us consider inner products between pseudo wave functions @xmath34 and the projectors @xmath35 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) ] in eq .  ( [ eqn : kbform ] ) . in the present scheme ,",
    "@xmath35 are the _ filtered _ projectors using the procedure in the preceding subsection while it is exactly the pseudopotential in the original dg technique .",
    "for simplicity , the illustration is limited to the one - dimensional case and an atom @xmath26 exits at the origin , hereafter .",
    "pseudopotentials are made to be finite at the original , and so the resulting pseudo wave functions are rather smoothly varying functions without nodes inside the cutoff region .",
    "on the contrary , the projectors , such as the @xmath41-states of first - row elements and the @xmath3-states of transition metals , are rapidly oscillating or rapidly varying functions . in this sense , pseudo wave functions are softer than pseudopotentials . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) , the values of pseudo wave functions on coarse - grid points ( @xmath32 ) are stored in computer memory , and the values on dense - grid points ( @xmath33 ) are evaluated by interpolation from them .",
    "the well - known values of pseudopotentials both on coarse- and dense - grid points ( @xmath32 ) are also shown schematically .",
    "one can see that only the values on coarse - grid points are so inadequate that the inner products can not be precisely calculated ; the errors are mainly due to the rapidly varying behavior of pseudopotentials . on the other hand",
    ", the inner products can be evaluated to great precision , if the number of dense - grid points is taken to be sufficiently large and also if the values of pseudo wave functions on dense - grid points are properly interpolated from those on coarse - grid points .",
    "although there are many interpolation schemes , we introduce the @xmath42th lagrange interpolation .",
    "the pseudo wave functions @xmath43 on dense - grid points @xmath44 are interpolated from @xmath45 on coarse - grid points @xmath46 as @xmath47 where @xmath48 + 1 $ ] , @xmath49 $ ] , and @xmath50 is the weight of the interpolation .",
    "in addition , @xmath51 $ ] means the maximum integer not greater than @xmath52 .",
    "the inner product is assumed to be precisely approximated by the discrete sum over the dense - grid points , i.e. , @xmath53 where @xmath3 is the `` diameter '' of the core region , @xmath54 is the dense - grid spacing , and @xmath55 is the number of dense - grid points existing between adjacent coarse - grid points , i.e. , @xmath56 with @xmath24 being the coarse - grid spacing , and @xmath57 is the number of coarse- ( dense- ) grid points in the core region . since pseudopotentials are made to be finite , we postulate that @xmath35 vanishes at @xmath58 . now , substituting eq .",

    "( [ eqn : kekka ] ) , the right - hand side of the inner product eq .",
    "( [ eqn : inner ] ) has been replaced with the summation over coarse - grid points inside the core region , which produces only a modest overhead in the computational cost .    in the paw formalism , the local effective potential ( sum of coulomb and exchange - correlation potentials ) is described on a grid that is two or three times denser than that for pseudo wave functions .",
    "this is a particular difference of the paw method from the norm - conserving pseudopotentials . to solve the eigenvalue problem for the kohn - sham hamiltonian",
    ", the local effective potential has to be described on the coarse grid points because pseudo wave functions @xmath61 are defined only on the coarse grid .",
    "this transformation from the dense grid to the coarse grid is achieved by the fourier transform in the case of the plane wave method . on the other hand , in the rsfd scheme",
    ", the egg box effect is a serious problem if one simply picks up the values of the potential on the dense grid and uses them in the eigenvalue problem . assuming that the dense grid for the local effective potential of the paw method corresponds to that in the dg technique",
    ", we can apply the dg technique to the transformation of the local effective potential as introduced in refs .   and .",
    "in the energy functional , the inner product of the local effective potential @xmath62 and pseudo charge density @xmath63 , which is defined as @xmath64 in ref .  , is given by    @xmath65    where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the volume of the computational region and the number of coarse grid points in the computational region , respectively .",
    "the pseudo charge density @xmath68 on dense - grid points @xmath44 is interpolated from @xmath69 on coarse - grid points @xmath46 as @xmath70 by substituting eq .",
    "( [ eqn : intercc ] ) into the right - hand side of eq .",

    "the extension to a periodic boundary conditions is straightforward .",
    "we now examine the efficiency of the present combination of the ff and the dg technique .",

    "the dense - grid spacing is set as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) is the coarse - grid spacing in the @xmath79 direction .",

    "are compared to those obtained by pwpaw@xcite and flapw@xcite calculations . in all calculations throughout the paper we used the vosko , wilk and nussair@xcite approximation to treat the unknown exchange correlation functional within the framework of the density - functional theory@xcite .",

    "we have shown that the present rsfd method is a band - structure method that gives ground state properties , such as lattice parameters , bulk moduli , and magnetic moments with the same accuracy as the flapw method , if identical exchange correlation functionals are used in the calculations , the differences between the rsfd and the flapw codes results are as small as @xmath86 0.01 bohr , @xmath86 0.05 mbar , and @xmath86 0.03 @xmath87 for lattice parameters , bulk modulii , and magnetic moments , respectively . although the cutoff energy required in the rsfd calculations is almost twice as large as that employed in the plane wave formalisms , this disadvantage can be compensated by the advantages of the rsfd formalism , e.g. , excellent performance on massively parallel computers , small computational cost for the operations concerning the projectors of pseudopotentials , and suitable algorithms for linear scaling computation .",

    "<S> we have developed an efficient computational scheme utilizing the real - space finite - difference formalism and the projector augmented - wave ( paw ) method to perform precise first - principles electronic - structure simulations based on the density functional theory for systems containing transition metals with a modest computational effort . by combining the advantages of the time - saving double - grid technique and the fourier filtering procedure for the projectors of pseudopotentials </S>",
    "<S> , we can overcome the egg box effect in the computations even for first - row elements and transition metals , which is a problem of the real - space finite - difference formalism . in order to demonstrate the potential power in terms of precision and applicability of the present scheme , </S>",
    "<S> we have carried out simulations to examine several bulk properties and structural energy differences between different bulk phases of transition metals , and have obtained excellent agreement with the results of other precise first - principles methods such as a plane wave based paw method and an all - electron full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method . </S>"
