    "it remains unclear what mechanisms in such long - lived sources lead to the repeated particle emission .",
    "is the production more stationary or rather intermittent during such long periods ?    to address these questions we examine in this paper a temporal evolution of the three long - lived @xmath0he - rich sep source active regions ( ars ) .",

    "the emerging phase of this ar ended on february 8 .",

    "stereo - a euv images ( see figure  [ fig2]e ) show a creation of a new flaring area in the west edge of ar  11045 , perhaps related to the same magnetic flux increase .",
    "this emergence occurred @xmath11.5  day before @xmath0he - rich sep injection observed by stereo - a .",
    "we investigated the temporal evolution of previously reported long - lasting @xmath0he - rich sep source ars  11244 and 11246 .",
    "we also identified a new long - lasting source ar 11045 and examined its evolution .",
    "we found that recurrent @xmath0he - rich seps in the long - lived sources occur after the emergence of magnetic flux .",
    "all these ars were newly emerging with the first particle emission occurring within @xmath11 - 2 days after the emergence .",
    "interestingly , the next @xmath0he - rich sep event in the same source was associated with additional magnetic flux emergence .",
    "the euv images or pfss extrapolations indicate that all three sources probably emerged into pre - existing open field .",
    "our observations are consistent with an earlier example of particle injection in the 2002 december 12 @xmath0he - rich sep event , which occurred about 1 day after the emergence of magnetic flux in a unipolar area @xcite .",
    "the authors have suggested that such a process may lead to magnetic reconnection , followed by particle acceleration on open field lines .",
    "the presented long - lasting sources exhibited a wide range of coronal activities .",
    "for example , ar  11244 produced several cool , surge - like eruptions , as well as a number of goes b - class x - ray flares .",
    "in contrast , ar  11246 produced only small euv brightenings .",
    "ar  11045 was the most active region with several b- , c- and m - class flares ( as well as hard x - rays ) and few slow coronal mass ejections .",
    "this likely implies that there is no preferred type of @xmath0he - rich sep source .",
    "it appears that any ar can be a @xmath0he - rich sep source if there is magnetic flux emergence near the open field region .",
