    "one of the main goals of the upcoming operational lhc is to search for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . because of the large mass of the top quark among all observed particles within the sm",
    ", it may give a special role in the generation of masses .",
    "therefore , it is crucial that its interactions with other particles be studied carefully .",
    "the deviations of the top quark interactions from the sm predictions may represent a good way to learn more about the nature of the electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite,@xcite .",
    "one approach to describe possible new physics effects is to use a model independent technique based on the effective low energy lagrangian . in this approach ,",
    "the sm lagrangian is modified by adding new @xmath10 gauge invariant operators @xcite,@xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the sm lagrangian , @xmath13 is the new physics scale , @xmath14 are dimension six operators which are gauge invariant before electroweak gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "@xmath15 are constants which represent the coupling strengths of @xmath14 .",
    "the dimension five operators violate the lepton number conservation .    upon electroweak symmetry breaking and giving our attention to the top quark",
    ", the modified @xmath6 couplings can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath16 + ( h.c.)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the weak coupling constant , @xmath18 is the w - boson mass , @xmath19 is the w - boson four - momentum .",
    "@xmath20 is the right - handed ( left handed ) projection operator . assuming @xmath7 conservation , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are real form factors .",
    "these anomalous couplings are related to the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the general effective lagrangian by @xcite : @xmath25    where @xmath13 is the scale of new physics . at tree level of the sm , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    at hadron colliders ,",
    "top quarks can be produced in @xmath28 pairs via strong interactions and singly via electroweak interactions .",
    "the introduced anomalous couplings have been studied via top pair events at the lhc and tevatron in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    in the sm single top quark events",
    "are expected to be produced via the @xmath4channel process ( @xmath29 ) , the @xmath5channel process ( @xmath30 ) and the @xmath3-channel process ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "these three processes have completely different kinematics and can be observed separately @xcite .",
    "the first evidence for single top was reported by d0 experiment at tevatron @xcite . at the tevatron ,",
    "the events of the @xmath3-channel can not be observed because of the very small cross section of this process .    a complete study of the @xmath6 anomalous couplings using the @xmath4channel and the @xmath5channel for lhc and tevatron has been performed in @xcite which has given the following bounds on the anomalous couplings ( assuming @xmath32 systematic uncertainty ) : @xmath33 the data coming from @xmath34 has applied very tight constraints on the @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "thus we do not consider @xmath35 in the present study .",
    "the @xmath3-channel has almost a large cross section at the lhc ( @xmath36 ) and does not receive any contribution from fcnc ( flavor changing neutral current ) , therefore it can be used to study the vertex of @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 .",
    "the aim of this article is to investigate the sensitivity of this channel to anomalous couplings and estimation of the possible bounds on @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the standard model predicts the top quark lifetime to be around @xmath39 s which corresponds to the top quark width of 1.5 gev . one should note that because of the experimental restrictions",
    ", it is very difficult to measure this very short lifetime or the corresponding width .",
    "however , we are able to set a lower limit on the top quark width from the available data from tevatron . in @xcite",
    "an upper limit has been set on the top quark width using a likelihood fit to the reconstructed top mass distribution . in the analysis the lepton+jets channel of @xmath28 candidates , in which one of two w - bosons decays to @xmath40 while the other decays to @xmath41 ,",
    "is used to reconstruct the top quark mass .",
    "finally , the estimated upper bound on the top quark width is 12.7 gev with @xmath42 c.l .",
    "this is corresponding to the lower limit of @xmath43 s for the top quark lifetime .",
    "the top quark width will not be measured very precisely at the lhc @xcite .    from another side , the introduced @xmath6 coupling , at tree level and in the limit of @xmath44 ,",
    "leads to the following formula for the width of top quark @xcite,@xcite :    @xmath45\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath46 and @xmath18 are top mass and w - boson mass , respectively and @xmath47 .",
    "fig.[width ] shows the top quark width as a function of anomalous couplings @xmath48 at tree level .",
    "+    obviously , the top quark width varies around 10 - 15 gev when the anomalous couplings change in a wide region @xmath49 .",
    "as stated above , the upper limit on the top quark width from the reconstructed top quark invariant mass distribution at tevatron is around 12.7 gev .",
    "this means that a wide region of the anomalous couplings ( @xmath50 ) is allowed from the present top quark invariant mass measurement .    in the next section the sensitivity of the cross section of the @xmath3 channel single top to the anomalous couplings",
    "is examined and new bounds on the anomalous couplings are estimated .",
    "the dependency of the @xmath3 channel of single top quark cross section on the anomalous couplings at the lhc is presented in fig.[sigma ] .",
    "this figure has been obtained by using the comphep package @xcite . in calculation of the cross section , it is assumed that @xmath51 = 175 gev / c@xmath52 , @xmath53 = 4.8 gev / c@xmath52 and cteq6l1 is used as the proton parton distribution function .    according to cms collaboration full simulation results ,",
    "the relative statistical uncertainty on measurement of the cross section @xmath54 of the @xmath3 channel taking into account 10 fb@xmath55 of integrated luminosity is 9.9@xmath56 @xcite . while atlas collaboration predicted 3@xmath56 for this value with 30 fb@xmath55 of integrated luminosity of data @xcite .",
    "therefore , the cross section of the @xmath3 channel will be measured precisely when the lhc is operational .",
    "channel single top production cross section on @xmath37 when @xmath57 ( left plot ) and on @xmath38 when @xmath58 ( right plot).,title=\"fig:\",width=453,height=302 ] +    in the @xmath3 channel process the single top quark is produced via @xmath31 process . in the di - leptonic decay mode , besides the charged lepton coming from top quark , missing energy and b - jet , the final state contains another charged lepton ( from the real @xmath59-boson ) with opposite sign of the charged lepton coming from top quark . the distribution of the transverse momentum @xmath60 of the charged lepton and the b - quark from the top quark decay are shown in fig.[pt ] .",
    "channel single top in the sm and for different values of @xmath61.,width=529,height=340 ]    according to the left plot in fig.[pt ] , the transverse momentum of the b - quark from the top quark is insensitive to the anomalous couplings .",
    "in contrast , the transverse momentum distribution of the charged lepton is shifted in the presence of anomalous couplings with respect to the sm case . as it has been shown in the right plot in fig.[pt ] , the mean value of the transverse momentum of the charged lepton is shifted toward the large @xmath62 region around 6 gev when the anomalous couplings are @xmath63 .",
    "one should note that this mean value depends on the range of the histogram ( e.g. the mean value of the @xmath62 distribution is increased when the range of the histogram is set to 300 gev / c instead of 150 gev / c ) . according to the charged lepton @xmath62 distribution , for very small values of @xmath64 ,",
    "the shift toward large @xmath62 region is negligible .",
    "modern detectors at the lhc are able to measrure the transverse momentum of the charged leptons ( muon and electron ) very precisely . for example , the cms detector is able to measure the @xmath62 of muons with the precision of  @xmath65 ( when muon is in the centeral region of the detector and @xmath66 gev / c ) @xcite",
    ". therefore , a shift of around 6 gev might be observable which corresponds to @xmath63 .",
    "however , a shift in the @xmath62 of the charged lepton distribution corresponding to @xmath67 is not observable .    in order to obtain a realistic estimate of the sensitivity of the @xmath3 channel single top at the lhc",
    ", one has to take into account backgrounds , detector effects and selection cuts .",
    "obviously , a comprehensive analysis of all reducible backgrounds and detector effects is beyond the scope of this study and must eventually be performed by the experimental collaborations . in @xcite a monte carlo study at parton level has been performed which is involved the separation of signal from backgrounds when two w - bosons decay to leptons . the most contributing backgrounds are @xmath28 and @xmath68 .",
    "the signal contains two high @xmath62 charged leptons , only one jet ( the b - jet coming from top quark ) and missing energy .    according to the proposed strategy for separation of signal from backgrounds in @xcite , the charged leptons and b - jet are required to have @xmath69 gev and to lie in the centeral region of the detector with @xmath70 .",
    "the following angular separation cut is applied on charged leptons and jet : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is separation in azimuthal angle and @xmath73 is the difference in pseudorapidity . after applying the above cuts , the significance at lhc with 20 fb@xmath55 of integrated luminosity is seen to be 84.9 .",
    "therefore , we use this selection strategy to suppress the backgrounds .    as mentioned before in this study ,",
    "the comphep package @xcite was used to simulate the @xmath3 channel single top production with anomalous couplings .",
    "we use simple @xmath74 criterion from the transverse momentum distribution of the charged lepton ( coming from the top quark ) with 20 fb@xmath55 of integrated luminosity to estimate the limits on anomalous @xmath6 couplings .",
    "the analysis is performed after application of the mentioned cuts for backgrounds suppression from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath74 criterion is defined as :    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the number of standard events in the i - th bin of the transverse momentum distribution of the charged lepton and @xmath77 is the number events predicted by the non - standard theory in the i - th bin ( in our case the theory with anomalous @xmath6 couplings ) .    in the present study , we have taken the advantage of the fact that , for small values of @xmath38 and @xmath37 , approximately the of the cross section of the @xmath3 channel in the presence of anomalous couplings is linear in @xmath38 and @xmath37 so the @xmath77 can be written linearly in @xmath38 and @xmath37 too . therefore , @xmath74 criterion depends quadratically on anomalous couplings .    in eq.[chi2 ]",
    ", @xmath78 is defined as : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the statistical uncertainty and @xmath80 is the term for including systematic uncertainties .",
    "systematic uncertainties from @xmath51 , parton distribution function , qcd scales , luminosity measurements and etc .",
    "are important for accurate results . however , at this stage it is difficult to give a realistic estimate of systematics .",
    "therefore , combined systematic uncertainties of 10@xmath56 and 25@xmath56 are taken into account .",
    "because of different sources of uncertainties , taking into account a combined systematic uncertainty of 25@xmath56 seems to give more realistic results .    using the @xmath74 function defined by eq.[chi2 ] ,",
    "the 68@xmath56 confidence level contours are drawn in fig.[countour ] assuming 10@xmath56 and 25@xmath56 of systematic uncertainties .",

    "comparing these limits with the limits which have been estimated by using the @xmath4channel and @xmath5channel of single top from @xcite ( mentioned in the introduction ) , clearly the @xmath3 channel is able to give better bounds on @xmath37 .",

    "the transverse momentum distribution of the b - quark from top is almost insensitive to anomalous couplings while the presence of anomalous couplings leads to a shift in transverse momentum of the charged lepton from top ( toward the large transverse momentum region ) . using a proposed strategy at parton level for separation of signal from backgrounds with 20 fb@xmath55 of integrated luminosity of data , the 68@xmath56 c.l .",
