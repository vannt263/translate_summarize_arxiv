    "when transforming results from lattice simulations into a continuum scheme such as @xmath0 it is often desirable to know the perturbative expansion of the renormalized coupling in powers of the bare lattice coupling .",
    "this is useful as an intermediate step for relating the @xmath0 coupling to the coupling defined in nonperturbative lattice schemes such as the ones based on the static quark potential @xcite and schrdinger functional @xcite , and is also needed to translate bare lattice quark masses into the @xmath0 scheme ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the one loop coefficient in the expansion is of further interest because it determines the ratio of the lattice and @xmath0 @xmath1-parameters @xcite .",
    "moreover , the one loop coefficient is also needed for determining the two loop relation between the couplings , from which the third term in the lattice beta - function ( governing the approach to the continuum limit ) can be determined @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we derive , for general lattice fermion formulation , a compact general integral formula from which the fermionic contribution to the one - loop coefficient in the perturbative expansion of the @xmath0 coupling in powers of the bare lattice coupling can be extracted .",
    "the motivations for pursuing this are as follows .",
    "first , given the plethora of lattice fermion actions currently in use , and the likelyhood of new ones or improved versions of present ones being developed in the future , it is desirable where possible to have general formulae from which quantities of interest can be calculated without having to do the calculation from scratch each time .",
    "second , it is desirable to have independent ways to check the computer programs used these days to perform lattice perturbation theory calculations via symbolic manipulations . third , by reducing the calculation to a managable number of one loop lattice integrals one can more easily achieve greater numerical precision than with symbolic computer programs .",
    "this is important , since , as emphasized in @xcite , the one loop results need to be determined with very high precision to achieve reasonable precision in the two loop result . as a demonstration that the general formulae of this paper are useful in this regard , we apply them to obtain the fermionic contribution to the one loop coefficient in the case of wilson clover fermions @xcite to almost twice as many significant decimal places as in the previous literature .    as reviewed in sect .",
    "ii , determining the fermionic contribution to the one loop coefficient reduces to determining a constant @xmath2 arising in a logarithmically divergent one fermion loop lattice feynman integral @xmath3 , which has the general structure i(am)=(a^2m^2)+c_i [ 1.1 ] here @xmath4 is the lattice spacing and @xmath5 an infrared regulator fermion mass .",
    "the numerical factor in the log term is universal , whereas @xmath2 depends on the details of the lattice fermion formulation .",
    "@xmath3 arises from the one fermion loop contribution to the gluonic 2-point function , and it is from this that it was evaluated in previous works for specific lattice fermion formulations . however , ward identities allow @xmath3 to also be evaluated from the gluonic 3- or 4-point functions . in this paper",
    "we evaluate @xmath3 from the one fermion loop contribution to the gluonic 4-point function . in this case",
    "there are five lattice feynman diagrams to consider rather than the two diagrams for the gluonic 2-point function ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ vac1 ] .",
    "@xmath6    nevertheless , evaluation of @xmath3 from the 4-point function turns out to be advantageous .",
    "the diagrams are evaluated at vanishing external momenta without the need to first take momentum derivatives , and we find three nice properties : ( i ) only one of the five diagrams is logarithmically divergent  it is the first @xmath7 diagram in fig .  [ vac1 ] .",
    "the other four diagrams are all convergent .",
    "( ii ) the logarithmically divergent diagram is not affected by changes in how the link variables are coupled to the fermions ( e.g. , it is unchanged by adding staples , clover term etc . ) . consequently , it is the same for improved and unimproved versions of the lattice fermion formulation ( provided the free field formulations are the same ) .",
    "( iii ) the four convergent diagrams , or subsets of them , vanish when the lattice dirac operator is sufficiently simple .",
    "in particular , they all vanish for unimproved wilson and staggered fermions , also when the naik term @xcite is included .",
    "thus for improved versions of wilson and staggered fermions the only new quantities to compute relative to the unimproved case are the four convergent one - loop lattice integrals .",
    "the main result in this paper is a general integral formula for @xmath3 obtained by evaluating the contributions from the five @xmath7 feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "[ vac1 ] for general lattice fermion formulation , from which the desired constant @xmath2 can be extracted .",
    "specifically , we do the following : ( a ) evaluate the contribution from the logarithmically divergent diagram , deriving a quite explicit general formula which is seen to reproduce previous results for the cases of unimproved wilson and naive / staggered fermions , and ( b ) derive formulae for , and describe a straightforward procedure for evaluating , the contributions from the four convergent diagrams .",
    "we illustrate this in the case of wilson clover fermions .",
    "the general formulae lead to integrals to which the method of ref .",
    "@xcite can be applied , reducing the integrals to basic lattice integrals that are already known to high precision .",
    "the application of our result to other lattice fermion formulations such as asqtad staggered fermions @xcite and overlap fermions @xcite will be made in future work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii reviews the one loop expansion of the @xmath0 coupling in the bare lattice coupling , using the background field approach . in sect .",
    "iii we derive an initial expression for @xmath3 as the sum of contributions from the five @xmath7 diagrams in fig .  1 and point out the properties ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) mentioned above .",
    "rather than evaluating the diagrams directly , we infer them from perturbative expansion of the fermion determinant , which is easier . from this",

    "vi describes applications to be carried out in future work , as well as the possibility of deriving similar results for the gauge  ghost contribution to the one loop coefficient .",

    "a further advantage becomes apparent when considering the description of @xmath45 in terms of lattice paths @xcite ( we will discuss the path description more explicitly in sect .",

    "i emphasize that , in the approach of the present paper , the technical problem of calculating the one fermion loop contribution for overlap fermions is greatly reduced compared to the usual approach followed in @xcite .",

    "this seems quite possible . in the background field",

    "this can also be done in the gluonic ",

    "<S> a compact general integral formula is derived from which the fermionic contribution to the one - loop coefficient in the perturbative expansion of the @xmath0 coupling in powers of the bare lattice coupling can be extracted . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen to reproduce the known results for unimproved naive , staggered and wilson fermions , and has advantageous features which facilitate the evaluation in the case of improved lattice fermion formulations . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in the case of wilson clover fermions , and an expression in terms of known lattice integrals is obtained in this case which gives the coefficient to much greater numerical accuracy than in the previous literature .    </S>"
