    "the predictions have exploited both quark  gluon and hadron viewpoints , and include objects such as exotic multi  quark states and molecular  like baryonic states .",
    "obviously the experimental discovery of another dibaryon would provide new insight into hadron and quark  gluon dynamics at the gev scale .",
    "a recent claim for dibaryon production has been published by the di2@xmath1 collaboration at the jinr phasotron @xcite .",
    "the collaboration measured the proton  proton double bremsstrahlung reaction @xmath6 by directing 216  mev protons onto a liquid hydrogen target and recording @xmath1ray coincidences in two csi / nai detector arrays .",
    "the authors observed an intriguing structure in the background  subtracted energy spectrum of the @xmath1ray coincidence data .",
    "it comprised a relatively narrow peak centered at about 24  mev and a relatively broad peak centered at about 60  mev .",
    "they attributed the structure to the @xmath0 dibaryon with mass @xmath7  mev and width @xmath8  mev .",
    "they hypothesized that @xmath0 dibaryons were first produced via the two - body process @xmath9 and then decayed via the three - body process @xmath10 , thus contributing to @xmath11 double bremsstrahlung .",

    "@xcite would have an electric charge @xmath12 , an isospin component @xmath13 , and therefore an isospin of @xmath14 .",
    "the narrow width of the claimed @xmath0 state implies that its quantum numbers either forbid or strongly suppress the @xmath15 decay mode .",
    "thus , if the @xmath0 is isovector ( @xmath16 ) , it must have spin - parities @xmath17 etc .",

    "the outgoing photons were detected by electron - positron pair production in a 1  mm cylindrical lead converter and @xmath36 , @xmath37 tracking in a cylindrical drift chambers .",
    "a 1.2  kg axial magnetic field was used for momentum analysis and concentric plastic scintillator rings were used for fast triggering . the trigger scintillator package consisted of the a - ring ( just inside the pb converter radius ) , the c - ring ( just inside the multiwire drift chamber radius ) , and the d - ring ( just outside the drift chamber radius ) . for more information on the spectrometer",

    "the two  photon trigger was based upon the multiplicities and topologies of hits in the trigger scintillators and the drift chamber cells .",
    "the scintillator trigger required zero hits in the a - ring , two or more hits in the c - ring , three or more hits in the d - ring , and a c - d topology consistent with the conversion of two @xmath1-rays .",
    "the drift chamber trigger imposed minimum values for number of the drift cell hits or the drift cell clusters in each drift chamber layer .    during a four week running period we accumulated @xmath1-ray coincidence spectra from a total of about @xmath38 pion stops in the deuterium target .",

    "the @xmath48 decay background yielded photon - pairs with opening angles of @xmath49 and summed energies of @xmath50 .",

    "a photon cut required that the electron - positron pairs intersect at the lead converter and that the photon pairs originate from the deuterium target .",
    "the total number of photon pairs , _",
    "i.e. _ events surviving the tracking cuts and photon cuts , was @xmath54 .",
    "these photon pairs ( shown in fig .  [ fig : raw ] ) are dominated by the real @xmath1-@xmath1 coincidences from @xmath48 decays and accidental @xmath1-@xmath1 coincidences from @xmath45-@xmath45 events and @xmath47-@xmath45 events .",

    "[ fig : signal ] .",
    "the opening - angle spectrum is a broad continuum and shows the opening angle cut of @xmath60 we employed to remove the events from @xmath48 decay .",
    "the individual energy spectrum is a broad continuum with a low  energy cut - off at about 25  mev due to the acceptance of the spectrometer .",
    "the 370 two - photon events in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal ] are entirely consistent with non - resonant capture in pionic deuterium .",
    "specifically , using the measured branching ratio for non - resonant double radiative capture on hydrogen of @xmath61 @xcite , and naively assuming the ratio of single radiative capture to double radiative capture to be identical on a hydrogen target and a deuterium target , we would expect about @xmath62 events from non - resonant @xmath63 .",
    "in addition the measured angle and energy distributions are in good agreement with our monte carlo simulations of the non - resonant process using the theoretical model of beder @xcite . the expected signature of dibaryon events , a monoenergetic peak from the production process @xmath64 and a three - body continuum from the decay process @xmath22 , is not seen .",
    "to determine the detection efficiency for dibaryon events we used a monte carlo computer program .",
    "the program incorporated the detailed geometry of the rmc detector and detailed interactions of the various particles .",
    "our program was based on the cern geant3 package @xcite and is described in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the simulation was tested by measurements of the detector response with a liquid h@xmath40 target .",
    "negative pion stops in hydrogen provide a well known source of photon pairs from ( i ) @xmath65 charge exchange followed by @xmath29 decay and ( ii ) accidental @xmath1-@xmath1 coincidences from multiple @xmath45 stops .",
    "we found the energy - angle distributions from experiment and simulation to be in good agreement .",
    "the absolute detection efficiencies from experiment and simulation differed by 4% ( the run - to - run variation of the spectrometer acceptance was @xmath66% ) .",
    "this difference was attributed to detector inefficiencies that were present in the measurement but were absent in the simulation . a multiplicative correction factor",
    "@xmath67 was therefore incorporated to account for this .    as described earlier , the @xmath0 signature is a monoenergetic @xmath1-ray peak from dibaryon production , @xmath68 , and a three - body continuum from dibaryon decay , @xmath22 .",
    "the production @xmath1-ray energy is approximately @xmath69 and increases from @xmath70  mev for @xmath71  mev to @xmath72  mev for @xmath73  mev .",
    "the decay @xmath1-ray spectrum is peaked near the end - point energy , @xmath74 , as typically the two neutrons carry only a small fraction of the available energy .",
    "however the detailed shape of the three - body spectrum is dependent on the @xmath75-final state interaction and consequently on the @xmath0 quantum numbers .",
    "representative simulations of dibaryon signatures for @xmath76 = 1920 and 1956 mev , assuming a 3-body phase space distribution for @xmath77 decay , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simulation ] . note that for @xmath76 = 1920 mev the production and decay @xmath1-ray spectra are separated whereas for @xmath76 = 1956 mev the production and decay @xmath1-ray spectra overlap .",
    "because the exact line shape of the decay @xmath1-ray is not known , we obtained our limits on @xmath0 production by determining limits on the production @xmath1-ray yield .",
    "specifically we fit the sum of a polynomial function , parameterizing the non - resonant background , and a gaussian peak , accounting for @xmath0 production , to the @xmath1-@xmath1 coincidence energy spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal ] .",
    "the gaussian peak centroid was stepped from @xmath78 to @xmath79  mev and the gaussian peak width was fixed at the instrumental resolution of the rmc detector ( _ i.e. _ @xmath804 - 5  mev for @xmath8140 - 80  mev ) .",
    "this procedure yielded a limit on the number of dibaryon events as a function of dibaryon mass .",
    "we then converted the event limit on dibaryon production to a branching ratio limit on dibaryon production via @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the limit on the dibaryon events , @xmath84 is the number of live - time corrected pion stops , and @xmath85 is the detector acceptance .",
    "the appropriate acceptance was obtained using the monte carlo for dibaryon production and assuming a three - body phase space distribution for @xmath22 decay ( cf .",
    "[ fig : brlimit ] ) .",
    "as discussed earlier the factor @xmath86 accounts for detector inefficiencies which are present in the experiment but are absent in the simulation .",
    "the factor @xmath87 accounts for the fraction of incident pions that stopped in deuterium ( see wright _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite for details ) .    the resulting branching ratio upper limit on @xmath0 production in @xmath39d capture",
    "was found to be @xmath2 ( 90% c.l . ) for @xmath0 s in the mass range of @xmath3 to @xmath4  mev and width of @xmath88  mev ( see fig .  [",
