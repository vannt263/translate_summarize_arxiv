    "understanding the new physics behind small neutrino masses is a major current focus of particle theory research .",
    "the simplest scenarios for this are the various types of seesaw mechanisms , which have also formed the basis for understanding the observed mixing pattern , which is so different from the quark sector .",
    "two of them , type - i  @xcite and the inverse seesaw  @xcite postulate the existence of heavy sm singlet fermions , generally denoted by the symbol @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is a generation index ) in addition to the sm fermions .",
    "the stability of these patterns can be guaranteed by extending the sm gauge group as we discuss below .",
    "these singlet fermions couple to familiar lepton doublets via yukawa couplings of the form @xmath3 , which after electroweak symmetry breaking leads to the dirac mass of the neutrino , which is expected to be in the gev range . in the type - i seesaw ,",
    "the tiny neutrino mass arises once we introduce an additional majorana mass term @xmath4 for the @xmath5 s .",
    "being sm singlets , these majorana particles can take arbitrarily large mass values , which then guarantees that the neutrino mass given by the formula below is small : @xmath6 note that since the scale of neutrino masses is known to be in the sub - ev range , the scale @xmath7 is correlated with the magnitude of the yukawa couplings @xmath8 .",
    "for instance , if the @xmath5 masses are in the 100 gev range , it implies @xmath9 or so .",
    "however , for specific flavor pattern of both @xmath10 and @xmath8 , tiny neutrino masses can be realized without making @xmath11 necessarily tiny .",
    "examples of such theories are given in  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of inverse seesaw models , in addition to the set of singlets @xmath1 , one adds another set of singlet fermions @xmath12 which form a dirac mass @xmath7 with the @xmath1 fields , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "the model so far has conserved lepton number and leads to zero neutrino mass  @xcite .",
    "one then allows the @xmath14 fields to have a majorana mass matrix @xmath15 whose overall scale is in the kev range  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino mass formula in this case is given by : @xmath16 this also leads to tiny majorana mass for neutrinos .",
    "the small scale of the @xmath15 matrix can be explained in various ways  @xcite and is a window to further new physics . in this model",
    "since the small neutrino masses arise from the small values of @xmath15 matrix elements , the singlet neutrinos @xmath17 form a dirac pair with masses in the 100 gev range and yet have yukawa couplings of order @xmath18 without any fine - tuning .",
    "a key question for neutrino mass physics is how to test the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the obvious first step would be to determine the couplings @xmath8 and @xmath19 .",
    "the vast literature on neutrino mass models is devoted to precisely this question where additional theoretical assumptions such as symmetries are used for this purpose .",
    "the symmetries restrict the theory to a particular sub - space of the full parameter - space .",
    "if the seesaw scale is high , as is the case in most type - i models , this appears to be the only realistic possibility .",
    "we take a different approach in this paper .",
    "since @xmath8 denotes the coupling of the @xmath5-fermions to the higgs boson , if @xmath7 is in the 100 gev range , experimental information on @xmath11 can be obtained from the lhc data on the higgs boson decays  @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is to focus on this question . in this paper",
    ", we consider primarily the inverse seesaw case and we will comment on the specific type - i scenarios where our results will apply with slight changes .",
    "the main result of the paper i.e. bounds on the the yukawa couplings @xmath8 , is derived from an analysis of the 7-tev lhc data .",
    "the 8-tev data came out after this work was finished .",
    "however , we have redone our analysis with this new data and found that the change in the bounds is very minimal .",
    "we comment on it briefly at the end of the paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ gaugemodel ] , we discuss the minimal gauge models with inverse seesaw ; in section [ generalpheno ] we give an overview of the higgs phenomenology of the seesaw models ; in section [ llnunubound ] we shall illustrate how to constrain the parameter - space in seesaw models using the results of the higgs searches in the final state @xmath20 ; in section [ postdiscovery ] we derive these constraints on the seesaw models by analyzing the rates of all the measured decay modes of the higgs boson ; the concluding remarks are in section [ conclusion ] . in appendix",
    "a , we list the relevant decay widths of the heavy neutrino .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss two classes of model which can have @xmath18 dirac yukawa couplings and @xmath21 gev mass for the singlet fermions responsible for the seesaw mechanisms .",
    "one class , as noted above , is the inverse seesaw model , where this situation can be naturally realized , and a second class , which belongs to type - i seesaw - based neutrino mass models where with specific texture for the dirac yukawa matrices as well as for the singlet fermion mass matrix , one can have lhc - accessible parameters .      if we simply add two heavy sm singlet fermions @xmath22 to the sm , there are many gauge invariant terms in the potential and we will not get the simple inverse seesaw formula .",
    "the simplest extension of sm where the inverse seesaw formula arises naturally is @xmath23 with gauge symmetry under which the singlet fermions @xmath5 transform as @xmath24 and @xmath14 fields are singlets .",
    "the gauge symmetry is broken by a higgs field @xmath25 acquiring vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and the sm - doublet @xmath26 vev then breaks the gauge group down to electromagnetic @xmath27 .",
    "the yukawa lagrangian for the lepton sector is given by : @xmath28 it is clear that once we substitute @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we get the inverse seesaw matrix  @xcite @xmath31 with the mass matrix for the neutrinos given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) with @xmath32 ( note that @xmath33 are in general @xmath34 matrices ) . at the renormalizable level , there are no other terms allowed in the yukawa lagrangian by the gauge symmetry and therefore the above inverse seesaw formula for neutrinos is stable under radiative corrections .",
    "our goal is to find constraints on @xmath11 as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "there exists an extensive analysis on the constraints for light singlet fermions  @xcite .",
    "although this analysis addresses only the constraints on majorana neutrinos , some of their results apply to our case as well",
    ". however , the limits derived in  @xcite for @xmath35 gev or so are very weak",
    ". furthermore constraints from neutrino - less double beta decay  @xcite derived on heavy sterile neutrinos do not apply to this case since in our model , the @xmath5 and @xmath14 form a pseudo - dirac pair and lepton number is almost exactly conserved .    in order to use the lhc data to explore constraints on @xmath11 and @xmath7 in the 100 gev range",
    ", we will assume that ( i ) @xmath36 and ( ii ) the mass of re(@xmath37 ) is heavy compared to the sm higgs boson so that neither the heavy gauge boson associated with @xmath38-symmetry nor the interactions of re(@xmath37 ) affect the higgs boson decay modes we consider .",
    "it follows from the above lagrangian that if one of the singlet fermions has mass in the 100 gev range , it will affect the higgs branching ratios : for instance if @xmath39 , then this opens up a new mode for sm higgs decay , i.e. , @xmath40 , and the collider signal will arise from @xmath41 mixing diagram in fig .  [",
    "fig : hdecayiss ] where @xmath42 .",
    "folding @xmath43 decays , one will get final states with @xmath44 where in the final state both charged leptons and anti - leptons will appear and the existing lhc data on these final states will provide constraints on @xmath11 .",
    "clearly , which charged lepton appears will depend on the flavor structure of @xmath11 and @xmath45 . for @xmath45 we will go to a basis so that it is diagonal , i.e. a linear combination of @xmath46 and @xmath5 are mass eigenstates with @xmath14 field providing the chiral dirac partner .",
    "mediated by the iss couplings.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   mediated by the iss couplings.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]      turning to the type - i case , as noted earlier , in generic models , the dirac yukawa couplings are very small for the seesaw scale in the tev regime .",
    "however , for specific textures for @xmath11 , it is possible to attain singlet fermion mass in the 100 gev range with dirac yukawa @xmath11 s of order @xmath18 while still satisfying the neutrino oscillation data . in this case",
    "the singlet fermions could show up at the lhc .",
    "two examples of this type of texture are  @xcite : @xmath47 with the constraint that @xmath48 where @xmath19 are the singlet neutrino masses and the singlet fermion mass matrix is diagonal .",
    "seesaw of this kind leads in the leading order to zero neutrino masses ; small @xmath49 can then generate the neutrino masses and mixings , and this will not affect the yukawa couplings or the masses @xmath19 .",
    "a second example has @xmath8 of the following type  @xcite : @xmath50 with right handed neutrino mass matrix of the form @xmath51 with @xmath52 . in the limit of @xmath53",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is a null matrix regardless of the values of @xmath19 and @xmath54 and small neutrino masses arise from choosing @xmath55 s and @xmath56 s small . to the best of our knowledge , we are not aware of any symmetries that will guarantee these textures for the @xmath7 and @xmath11 matrices and it will be interesting to seek symmetry origin for them . therefore again in this case ,",
    "lhc data should put constraints on @xmath54 vs @xmath19 . since in this case",
    ", @xmath11 s are arbitrary , they could be of democratic type which will mean that there are multiple flavor final states .",
    "two important points regarding these models are worth emphasizing . in both models , as the small parameters ( @xmath15 in the case of inverse seesaw , and @xmath56 and @xmath55 in the type - i model discussed above ) go to zero , the neutrinos become massless . as a result , the neutral higgs decays to two modes : @xmath57 . unlike the case where both @xmath46 and @xmath5 are majorana fermions ( as in generic type - i seesaw models )",
    ", the higgs decay rate to @xmath58 final states becomes twice as large .",
    "thus , the discussions of higgs decay in both classes of models are similar except for the flavor richness in case ( b ) compared to case ( a ) . in case ( b ) model ( ii ) , for @xmath59 , all flavors couple with equal strength to a single fermion flavor @xmath1 implying that final state signal becomes a combination of all three flavors .",
    "similar situation also occurs for case ( b ) , model i if @xmath60 .",
    "as discussed above , a new yukawa interaction in the leptonic sector can potentially alter the higgs phenomenology in a dramatic way .",
    "in fact , in the models considered here , the yukawa coupling of the neutrino can be sizable  in principle , much larger than the largest yukawa coupling involved in the decay of a light sm higgs boson , i.e. , the one with the bottom quark which is of order @xmath61 .",
    "here we shall describe the observable consequences of the new yukawa coupling . focusing on the inverse seesaw case",
    ", it is apparent from the neutrino mass formula in eq .",
    "( [ massiss ] ) that neutrino mass fits will largely be dictated by the combination of the flavor structure of the @xmath15 matrix and the @xmath11-matrix .    in quark - lepton unified theories ,",
    "the natural expectation is that flavor mixings in @xmath11 are `` weak '' .",
    "so we can assume @xmath11 to be a diagonal matrix .",
    "the next question is the relative magnitude of different flavor yukawa couplings . below we will consider the cases when ( a ) @xmath62 , ( b ) @xmath63 , and ( c ) a democratic form where all the yukawa couplings are equal .",
    "these different coupling structures imply distinctive flavor structure of the final states . from the interaction lagrangian ,",
    "( [ lagrangianiss ] ) , it follows that @xmath8 mediates the decays illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hdecayiss ] : @xmath64 where charged and neutral leptons arise in all the flavor combinations allowed by the form of the @xmath11 matrix .",
    "the gauge bosons @xmath65 and @xmath66 arise in the decay of @xmath5 through the @xmath67 mixing , that is @xmath68 .",
    "the gauge bosons in turn can decay into leptons or hadrons , such that the new yukawa coupling contributes to the rates of both fully leptonic and semi - leptonic final states .",
    "the heavy particles @xmath69 , @xmath66 and @xmath65 in the decay chain of eq .",
    "( [ eq : genericdecays ] ) can be either on - shell or off - shell depending on the mass of @xmath69 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath70 the higgs decay width in eq .",
    "( [ eq : genericdecays ] ) scales as @xmath71 while for @xmath72 , it scales as @xmath73 .",
    "the fully leptonic decay mode of the higgs @xmath20 is among the most sensitive search channels of the higgs and therefore is a very sensitive probe of the @xmath11-coupling , especially for @xmath74 not far above or below @xmath75 .",
    "this allows us to derive a bound on the @xmath76 parameter space as described in detail in section  [ llnunubound ] .    for definiteness in what follows",
    ", we shall focus on the case of the iss model with only one light flavor of heavy neutrino which we choose to be the electron flavor , @xmath77 , and the corresponding yukawa coupling @xmath78 to the higgs doublet .",
    "we generically denote the mass of the heavy neutrino as @xmath79 , suppressing the explicit flavor index @xmath80 .    in this scenario the decay chain of eq .",
    "( [ eq : genericdecays ] ) becomes @xmath81    the decay of the @xmath65 boson to leptons produces pairs of charged leptons of all flavors , and hence , it contributes to the same flavor final states , namely @xmath82    the decay of the @xmath66 boson produces a single charged lepton . in this case , the @xmath66 is produced by a mixing effect of the heavy @xmath77 , and therefore , the @xmath66 is always produced in association with an electron or a positron .",
    "hence , the decay process mediated by the @xmath66 only contributes to electron final states , namely @xmath83    altogether , due to the assumed coupling structure @xmath62 , the final state leptons of the higgs decays mediated by the iss are both of opposite flavor and of same flavor , with same flavor @xmath84 getting its only contribution from processes with @xmath65-boson intermediate state .    for the other coupling patterns the resulting flavor structures are straightforward modifications of the one considered here . for the pattern ( b )",
    "where @xmath63 , the main difference is that now it is the same flavor @xmath80 final state that gets its only contribution from the @xmath65-intermediate state .",
    "the opposite flavor final states again get contribution from both @xmath65- and @xmath66-mediated processes , though with the kinematics of @xmath80 and @xmath84 exchanged .",
    "as in our analysis described in the next sections there is going to be little difference between @xmath80 and @xmath84 , the bounds derived for the iss with light @xmath77 also apply for the case of light @xmath85 .",
    "so far we considered a basis in which the @xmath45 matrix is diagonal .",
    "there are however possible situations where one can derive bounds on yukawa couplings .",
    "for instance , it is possible to have structure of the @xmath45 and @xmath11 matrices where democratic yukawa couplings can emerge i.e. by assuming an appropriate texture for the @xmath86 dirac mass matrix we can have the lightest heavy neutrino @xmath5 as a linear combination of all the three flavor states with equal probability , i.e. , @xmath87 . in this case , if @xmath11 is a unit matrix , then we expect all the possible flavor combinations to be equally populated as both the interactions of @xmath88 and the gauge bosons are flavor - universal . the analyses of the lhc experiments are mostly sensitive to @xmath80 and @xmath84 flavors only ,",
    "therefore for such a democratic case , only 4 out the 9 possible final state flavor combinations are easily detectable   may be used to recover some sensitivity .",
    "however , they are only a fraction of the @xmath89 decay modes , and there are detection inefficiencies . as such , the gain might not be huge . at any rate ,",
    "the use of the @xmath89 s requires careful experimental considerations that go beyond our competence ; hence we prefer not to consider them . ] .",
    "furthermore the effect of the mixing of flavors in the lightest mass eigenstate @xmath5 in general reduces the rate of @xmath80 and @xmath84 leptons . because of these effects the bounds",
    "should be recalculated carefully to account for the different flavor structure of the signal .",
    "however , neglecting the sub - dominant processes mediated by the @xmath65 , one can obtain an estimate for the bound in the democratic case .",
    "indeed , the rates of the processes mediated by the @xmath66 are just rescaled by mixing and multiplicity factors compared to those of the iss model with only a light @xmath77 . as such",
    ", the bounds of the iss case should be relaxed by a constant factor . in particular , from the fact that the rate of eq .",
    "( [ eq : issdecays ] ) scales as @xmath90 when @xmath91 and as @xmath92 when @xmath93 , we find that the bound gets relaxed by a factor @xmath94 or @xmath95 in the two cases .    in the following , we shall illustrate in detail how to derive a bound on the yukawa coupling in the iss model . using the same procedure",
    ", we also computed the bound for the type - i democratic case and we checked that this simple rescaling argument describes the actual bound to a very good accuracy .",
    "hence , we give only the bounds for the iss case , and those for the democratic type - i case can be obtained by the simple rescaling described above . of course a more targeted analysis from the lhc experiment with flavor structure explicitly taken into account",
    "could distinguish between these coupling structures .",
    "for instance , an imbalance between the @xmath80 and @xmath84 same flavor final states can distinguish case ( a ) and case ( b ) , while case ( c ) would be favored if all the flavor combination appear to be equally populated .",
    "irrespective of the flavor structure of the yukawa interactions , the new yukawa coupling mediates new decay modes of the higgs , which contribute to its total width , and hence , in these seesaw models , the higgs width is larger than in the sm : @xmath96 the seesaw contribution to the the total width is necessarily model - dependent . for the case of the iss with dominant coupling @xmath78 , the width and @xmath97 . ]",
    "is given by @xmath98 where we have normalized the yukawa couplings such that the dirac mass terms of all fermions are @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "in the case of the democratic type - i seesaw , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : democratic ] ) , we can take @xmath101 ; hence the lagrangian essentially contains three interactions of equal strength for the higgs decay , and the higgs decay width is the same as in the iss model once @xmath102 is taken .    in section [ postdiscovery ] we shall discuss in detail how to use the information on the measured rates of the several higgs decay final states to put a bound on the seesaw coupling .",
    "the atlas and cms collaboration have both found evidence for a higgs - like particle at around 125 gev . the main evidence for the new particle comes from final states with resonant two photons or four leptons @xcite . in addition to the @xmath103 and @xmath104",
    "searches the lhc and tevatron experiments searched for a sm higgs boson in several other final states , including in the final state @xmath105 @xcite .    the experiments presented cut - based as well as multivariate analyses to put a bound on the mass of the sm higgs boson .",
    "the bounds from the multivariate analysis are generically ( slightly ) more stringent than the one obtained from the cut - based analysis .",
    "however the multivariate analysis can not be easily reproduced with our means , and hence , we shall only use the cut - based analysis to derive our bound .    here",
    "we shall reinterpret the results of  @xcite to extract a bound on extra sources of @xmath105 events . to do this",
    ", we shall repeat the cut - based analysis of  @xcite on event samples generated by monte carlo tools ",

    "hadrons have been clustered into jet with the anti - kt algorithm as implemented in @xmath109  @xcite .    in  @xcite ,",
    "the cms collaboration performed several analysis on the @xmath105 sample collected in the year 2011 with the lhc running at @xmath110 tev center - of - mass energy .",
    "in particular they made a basic selection on the leptons , jets and missing energy of the events depending on the flavor of the final state leptons .",
    "the cuts for the opposite flavor ( of ) and same flavor ( sf ) cases are reported in table [ tab : baseline - selection ] .",
    "then the analysis is specialized for specific values of the sm higgs boson mass and further cuts are devised .",
    "these cuts are collected in the tables [ tab : a120 ] and [ tab : a130 ] for the higgs mass hypothesis of @xmath111 gev and @xmath112 gev , respectively .",
    "these analyses , which we call @xmath113 and @xmath114 , are the most sensitive to new physics connected to the higgs - like particle recently discovered , and hence , these are the only analyses we are going to repeat in order to extract our bound .",

    "this is done as follows : for each hypothesis for @xmath75 in the iss model we compute the yield of events after the cuts of cms .",

    "the lhc searches tends to be rather ineffective .",
    "in fact , in the iss signal both the charged leptons originate from @xmath140 and therefore the invariant mass of the two leptons can not exceed @xmath79 .",
    "the cuts @xmath141 gev for of ( sf ) leptons , needed to reject leptons from qcd decays , would remove completely the iss contribution for @xmath142 gev . also , for light @xmath79 the bounds from other experiments are more stringent  @xcite . the power of the lhc is the sensitivity to @xmath79 around and above the mass of the higgs , which improves significantly as compared to the reach of previous direct bounds .",
    "we remark that our computation of the total events yield neglects the possible interference between the iss and the sm contributions , which in general is a small effect due to different flavor and lorentz structure of the decays .",

    "in fact to make a correct use of the measured best - fit signal strengths of the @xmath168 channels one should consider each @xmath168 analysis separately and compute in detail the efficiencies as we have done for the analysis of  @xcite discussed in section [ llnunubound ] .    for these reasons we shall consider the bound from two sets of measurements . in both cases we take the iss model as reference . in the first case we put a bound on @xmath78 coming from all the measured signal strengths excluding the @xmath168 channels .",
    "this is the safest possibility as we are making the least number of assumptions on the structure of the seesaw couplings .",
    "additionally we compute the bound using all the available data on the higgs - like particle at 125 gev . to deal with the several @xmath168 analyses we make the simplifying assumption that all the efficiencies for the processes mediated by the seesaw coupling are the same as those computed for the analysis of section [ llnunubound ] . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : niss ] ) . as we find in section [ llnunubound ] that the iss efficiencies are quite similar to those of the sm",
    ", one can expect our simplifying assumption to be reliable for the atlas analysis as well . ]    to put a bound we proceed as follows .",
    "for each searched decay mode of the higgs the collider experiments give the best fit value of @xmath169 where @xmath170 runs on the higgs production modes and @xmath171 s are the branching fraction for the various higgs boson decay modes @xmath172 .",
    "these measured best fits are expressed in units of the sm prediction and are referred to as best - fit signal strengths @xmath173 where by @xmath174 we mean the central value and by @xmath175 we mean the symmetrized 1@xmath176 error on the best - fit of the channel @xmath172 given by the experiments .",
    "to place a bound we confront the iss prediction with the latest best - fit signal strengths given by the experiments at the lhc @xcite and the tevatron  @xcite . for convenience of the reader",
    "the best - fit signal strengths used in our analysis are reported in table  [ strengths ] .    .",
