    "argo - ybj is a full coverage air shower detector located at the yangbajing cosmic ray laboratory ( tibet , p.r .",
    "china , lat 30.1n , long 90.5e , 4300 m a.s.l . ) . due to its large field of view ( @xmath22 sr ) and its high duty cycle ( @xmath090@xmath3 ) it can monitor continously a large fraction of the sky , searching for gamma rays sources at energy e @xmath00.6 tev .    the apparatus is composed of a central carpet of resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) ( @xmath274@xmath4 78 m@xmath5 , @xmath293@xmath3 of active area ) enclosed by a guard ring with partial coverage , which allows to extend the instrumented area up to @xmath2100@xmath4110 m@xmath5 . the basic data acquisition element is a cluster ( 5.7@xmath47.6 m@xmath5 ) , made of 12 rpcs ( 2.8@xmath41.25 m@xmath5 ) .",
    "each chamber is read by 80 strips of 6.75@xmath461.8 cm@xmath5 ( the spatial pixel ) , logically organized in 10 independent pads of 55.6@xmath461.8 cm@xmath5 which are individually acquired and represent the time pixel of the detector .",
    "the full detector is composed of 153 clusters for a total active surface of @xmath26600 m@xmath5 @xcite",
    ".    operated in _ shower mode _ argo - ybj records all events with a number of fired pads n@xmath7 20 in the central carpet , detected in a time window of 420 ns .",
    "the spatial coordinates and the time of any fired pad are then used to reconstruct the position of the shower core and the arrival direction of the primary@xcite .",
    "the installation of the detector has been completed in autumn 2007 and since november 2007 argo - ybj is in stable data taking with a trigger rate of @xmath23.6 khz .",
    "the angular resolution and the pointing accuracy of the detector have been evaluated by using the moon shadow , i.e. the deficit of cosmic rays in the moon direction.@xcite . according to the moon shadow data ,",
    "the psf of the detector is gaussian for n@xmath8100 , while for lower multiplicities it can be described with an additional gaussian , which contributes for about 20% .",
    "the obtained values of the radius @xmath9 containing @xmath271.5@xmath3 of the signal , are 2.59@xmath10 0.16@xmath1 , 1.30@xmath10 0.14 and 1.04@xmath10 0.12@xmath1 respectively for n@xmath1140 , 100 and 300 , in agreement with expectations from monte carlo simulations .",
    "this measured angular resolution refers to cosmic rays - induced air showers .",
    "the angular resolution for @xmath12-induced events has been evaluated by simulations and it is 10 - 30% smaller ( depending on n@xmath13 ) , due to the better defined time profile of the showers .",
    "the data used in this analysis have been recorded from 2007 day 311 to 2009 day 89 for a total live time of 424 days . all events with a zenith angle @xmath1440@xmath1 and a number of hit pads on the central carpet n@xmath1540",
    "have been considered .",
    "the events with a large value of the @xmath16 resulting from the fitting procedure for the arrival direction determination , have been discarded from the analysis .    with these events , five sky maps in celestial coordinates",
    "are built , for different number of hit pads : n@xmath1540 , 60 , 100 , 200 , 300 .",
    "the maps are produced with the healpix package ( hierarchical equal area isolatitude pixelization)@xcite .",
    "each map has @xmath23.14 10@xmath17 pixels of equal area @xmath20.013 squared degrees .",
    "the observed sky covers the declination band from -10@xmath1 to 70@xmath1 .",
    "the background is evaluated with the _ time swapping _ method @xcite . for each detected event ,",
    "10 `` fake '' events are generated by replacing the original arrival time with new ones , randomly selected from a buffer that spans about 4 hours of data taking .",
    "for every n@xmath13 interval , the `` event '' map and the `` background map '' are then integrated over a circular area of radius @xmath9 , i.e. every bin is filled with the content of all bins whose center has an angular distance less than @xmath9 from its center .",
    "the value of the smoothing radius , related to the angular resolution , is the angle that maximizes the signal to noise ratio from a crab - like source , according to simulations , i.e. @xmath9 = 1.3@xmath1 , 0.7@xmath1 and 0.5@xmath1 respectively for n@xmath1140 , 100 and 300 .",
    "finally the background map is subtracted to the relative event map , obtaining the `` signal map '' , where for every bin the statistical significance of the excess is calculated .",
    "fig 1 . shows the sky map for events with n@xmath1140 , obtained with a smoothing radius @xmath9=5@xmath1 , adding the data of the whole period .",
    "the map shows two large hot spots in the region of the galactic anticenter , already reported by the milagro detector@xcite .",
    "these regions have been interpreted as excesses of cosmic rays , but the origin is not yet understood . they could be related to the observed large scale anisotropy of cosmic rays due to the propagation of cosmic rays in the galactic magnetic field @xcite .",
    "some authors discuss the possibility of the hot spots being due to a galactic nearby source as a supernova explosion in the recent past@xcite .",
    "the two excesses ( @xmath0 10 standard deviations , corresponding to a flux increase of @xmath18 ) are observed by argo - ybj around the positions @xmath19120@xmath1 , @xmath2040@xmath1 and @xmath1960@xmath1 , @xmath20 - 5@xmath1 . in agreement with the milagro detection , even if the maximum of the second excess is slightly shifted towards lower declinations , probably because argo - ybj can observe with more efficiency the southern regions of the sky , being located at a smaller latitude than milagro .",
    "the two hot spots are also present in the map corresponding to events with a larger number of pad , even if with less significance due to the reduced statistics .",
    "the median primary energy @xmath21 corresponding to proton showers with n@xmath1140 ( 300 ) is @xmath2 2 ( 10 ) tev .",
    "the deficit regions parallel to the excesses are due to a known effect of the analysis , that uses also the excess events to evaluate the background , artificially increasing the background .",
    "the red dashed line represents the gaussian fit.,width=240 ]    the analysis of these hot spots will be the subject of a forthcoming paper . in this work , we refer to them only since they affect the point gamma ray source search .",
    "in fact the time swapping method applied over a time interval of 4 hours makes the analysis insensitive to features of scale larger than @xmath260@xmath1 , but all excesses of a smaller extension constitute a kind of `` noise '' for the point source search .",
    "if a source is located inside an excess region , its significance will be overestimated , and vice versa .    in order to renormalized the background eliminating all features of size 10 - 20@xmath1 , we multiplied the content of each bin of the background map by a correction factor f = e / b , where e and b are respectively the numbers of events of the event map and background map inside a circle of radius 8@xmath1 centered on that bin , excluding the events from the circle central region up to a radius of 3.5@xmath1 to avoid that a possible source affects the evaluation of e. fig .",
    "2 shows the sky map after the correction .",
    "the crab nebula and mrk421 are visible with a statistical significance respectively of 7.0 and 8.0 standard deviations .",
    "the obtained crab energy spectrum is in agreement with the observations by other experiments@xcite .",
    "mrk421 had many active states during 2008 , in particular during march and june , and has been deeply studied by argo - ybj in a dedicate paper@xcite .",
    "excluding the bins around the crab and mrk421 positions , the distribution of the excesses well fits to a gauss distribution with mean value = -3.6@xmath220.8 10@xmath23 and r.m.s.=1.01@xmath22 5 10@xmath24 ( fig.3 ) .        as a second step , we analised the maps contents at the positions of several known gamma rays sources .",
    "we adopted two gamma ray source catalogues :    \\a ) the recently published list of bright sources observed by fermi at e@xmath0100 mev@xcite    \\b ) the list of sources seen at e@xmath0100 gev@xcite    containing respectively 115 and 44 sources in the declination band corresponding to the argo - ybj field of view , of which 24 are contained in both lists .",
    "merging the two catalogues , we got a list of 135 sources , 86 extragalactic and 49 galactic ( or unidentified but lying close to the galactic plane ) . for every source the radius @xmath25 of the observational window is set to @xmath9 , unless the source is known to be extended . in this case @xmath25=",
    "@xmath26+@xmath27 ) where @xmath28 is equal to half the angular size .",
    ".agns observation : for each source is given a ) the redshift , b ) the culmination zenith angle @xmath29 , c ) the hours of observation per day , d ) the flux above 0.6 tev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the median energy @xmath21 corresponding to gamma rays showers with a given number of pads depends on the source spectrum and on the culmination zenith angle .",
    "for n@xmath1540 the median energy ranges from @xmath20.6 tev ( for a source culminating at the zenith and with a steep spectrum like e@xmath23 ) up to @xmath22 tev ( for a source culminating at 20@xmath1 with a e@xmath30 spectrum ) .",
    "4 shows the statistical significance of the observed sources , excluding the crab nebula and mrk421 , for n@xmath1540 .",
    "no source shows a significance larger than 4 standard deviations , however the mean value of the distribution of the excesses for galactic sources is clearly shifted towards positive values ( 0.45@xmath220.14 ) while the mean value for extragalactic sources is compatible with zero ( -0.02@xmath220.12 ) .",
    "we found 2 objects with a significance larger than 3 s.d for n@xmath860 , namely :    \\a ) mgroj1908 + 06 with 3.2 s.d .",
    "( discovered by milagro@xcite , confirmed by hess@xcite and recently associated to the fermi pulsar 0fgl j1907 + 5 + 0602)@xcite ;    \\b ) the unidentified hess source hessj1841 - 055 , with 3.0 s.d .",
    ";    considered the number of trials ( 133 sources @xmath45 n@xmath13 intervals ) and the small significance of the excesses it is difficult to say if they are due to gamma rays or to a background fluctuation .",
    "moreover the corresponding flux is larger than what expected from these source , in particular for hessj1841 - 055@xcite .",
    "since agns are known to be variable on different time scales , we have monitored the time behaviour of a subset of 11 agns known to emit at e @xmath0 100 gev , and having a culmination zenith angle @xmath3120@xmath1 in our field of view ( see tab.1 ) .",
    "the sources have been studied on time scales of 1 , 10 days and 30 days . for this analysis",
    "we have considered the data taken in the period 2007 day 311 - 2009 day 89 .    concerning the daily search , we found only one excess with a significance larger than 4 s.d .",
    "( 4.3 s.d . ) , from the blazar 1es0229 + 200 on 2008 day 259 , for n@xmath8 40 .",
    "however , considering the number of trials ( 11 sources @xmath4510 days @xmath4 5 n@xmath13 intervals ) this excess is consistent with a background fluctuation .    concerning the 10 days analysis , the only excess larger than 4 s.d .",
    "is due to mrk421 in the time intervals 2008 days 161 - 170 ( 4.6 s.d . ) during a strong x - ray flare .    looking for 30 days excess , the search has been done shifting the 30 days interval in steps of 10 days .",
    "also in this case we found several excesses from mrk421 with significances between 4 and 5 s.d .",
    ", in particular in the intervals : 2008 days 1 - 30 , 71 - 100 , 81 - 110 , 91 - 120 , 141 - 170 , when several x - ray flares have been observed@xcite .    for all sources except mrk421 (",
    "for which we give the observed flux ) we calculate the upper limit to the flux at a confidence level of 3 standard deviations .",
    "for each source we assumed a power law spectrum with a fixed spectral slope : dn / de = k e@xmath30 multiplied by an exponential factor e@xmath32 to take into account the absorption of gamma rays on the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "we evaluated @xmath33 interpolating the curves given by primack et al.@xcite for fixed redshifts in the range @xmath34=0.03 - 0.3 . lacking the absorption parameters outside this range , the upper limit for 3c66a ( @xmath34=0.444 ) and pg1553 + 113 ( @xmath34=0.36 )",
    "have not been evaluated , while for m87 ( @xmath34=0.004 ) we assumed no absorption .    from the number of observed events ( or the upper limit in case of no detection ) the corresponding gamma ray flux",
    "is determined by a complete simulation process that evaluates the expected number of events from a source with a given spectrum and a given daily path in the sky .",
    "tab.1 shows the observed integral flux above 0.6 tev for mrk421 and the upper limits obtained for the 8 agns with no detection , averaged over the whole observation period , for events with n@xmath1140 .    to know the minimum flux observable by argo - ybj during a flare of a generic duration @xmath35 days",
    ", one can multiply the upper limits given in the table by a factor @xmath36 , where @xmath37=424 is the total number of days considered in this analysis .",
    "for a period of @xmath215 months argo - ybj monitored the gamma ray sky in the declination band from -10@xmath1 to + 70@xmath1 .",
    "the observations of the background have revealed the existence of two regions with size of order 10@xmath130@xmath1 , where the cr flux is enhanced by approximately 0.1 % .",
    "the origin of these medium scale anisotropies , previously observed by the milagro experiment , remains unexplained .",
    "the data acquisition is currently going ahead with stable detection conditions .",
    "studies to improve the detector sensitivity are in progress , both in the direction of increasing the angular resolution@xcite and of rejecting the cosmic rays background@xcite , implementing gamma - hadron separation algorithms .",
