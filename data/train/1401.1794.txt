    "the star usually fills its roche lobe and its outermost layers of gas are stripped off its surface by the immense gravity of the compact object , and form an accretion disk .    in periods of increased accretion activity",
    ", x - ray novae can occur .",
    "x - ray novae are generally transient phenomena , waiting on average 10 - 50 years between outbursts ( tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) .",
    "attempts to create a unified model of the disk evolution in these outbursts ( esin et al . 1997 ) have led to the description of the outbursts as the combination of a thin accretion disk and an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) .",
    "observationally , these two migrate through several spectral states ( see e.g. reynolds & miller 2013 ) .",
    "the state important to this analysis is the thermal dominant state ( td state , formerly referred to as high state or high / soft state ) , in which the disk extends all the way to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , and dominates the emission ( esin et al .",
    "since the isco is entirely dependant on the spin ( @xmath5 for a schwarzschild bh , @xmath6 for a maximally prograde bh , @xmath7 for a maximally retrograde bh ) , measurements of the radius of the isco can be used to determine the spin of the bh .",
    "this is the idea behind the continuum fitting method , in which one fits a model of a thin accretion disk to thermal dominant state spectra of a bh to estimate the isco , and thus infer the spin ( zhang , cui , & chen 1997 , schafee et al .",

    "a common xspec model to describe the thin accretion disk is _ kerrbb _ ( arnaud 1996 ; li et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this model stands out since it takes the spin as a parameter used to define the model spectrum .",
    "it also includes relativistic effects such as limb - darkening or self irradiation of the disk . in order for this method to be used to estimate spin , the mass , distance , and inclination angle of the disk must be known ( zhang , cui , & chen 1997 ) .",
    "additionally , the spin measurement is dependent on the color correction factor ( @xmath8 ) .",

    "in fact the distance to gs 1124 - 683 has been revised by several authors ( della valle et al . 1991 ; orosz et al . 1996 ; shahbaz et al . 1997 ; gelino et al . 2001 ) , the most recent of which being gelino ( 2004 , hereafter g04 ) , who refined the method from gelino et al .",

    "we used the best fit values from g04 for mass , distance , and inclination because they are newer and better - constrained than other determinations , and since they were found using infrared photometry , from which the disk and hotspot produce less contamination in the light curve .",

    "the x - ray data we consider are those presented in ebisawa et al .",
    "for the continuum fitting method , we want to use spectra obtained when the source was in the td state . as per mcclintock et al ( 2006 ) , we selected disk luminosities less than 30% of the eddington limit , and restricted our observations to those in which the soft flux contributes at least 90% of the total flux ( @xmath14 ) based on the results reported in ebisawa et al .",

    "we also ignored the april 19 observation altogether because it required an excessively low color correction factor in order for the spin to be consistent with the other observations ( 1.36 ) , and because it had a @xmath19 value that was too high ( @xmath20 ) when @xmath4 was required to be within our allowed range ( 1.5 - 1.9 , see shimura & takahara 1995 ) .",

    "furthermore , as shown in figure  [ fig:1124spincontours ] , our upper limit to the spin is still retrograde .",
    "if the spin is actually prograde one of two things must be true .",
    "either the distance must be considerably smaller than that given by g04 , or the bh mass must be larger . to find out how much closer , or more massive it needs to be , we fixed either mass or distance to their best determination from g04 , and slowly raised or lowered the other until their best fit value of @xmath23 was greater than 0 .",
    "when we varied the mass , and held the distance constant , we found that gs 1124 - 683 must have @xmath103 .",
    "this is in disagreement not only with g04 , but also with shahbaz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who constrained the bh mass to be less than @xmath104 at the 90% confidence level using the maximum mass of the secondary star ( inferred from the spectral type ) .",
    "this makes a mass of @xmath2 unlikely , so if the black hole is prograde , it is more likely that the distance to the binary is lower .",
    "in fact , in order for the spin to be prograde , the distance would have to be @xmath105 , still greater than the maximum allowed distance from shahbaz et al .",
    "if we take their entire range of mass and distance into account however , and perform a grid search , we find that the spin found using their best determination of the mass and distance is still retrograde ( @xmath106 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) , there is no lower bound on @xmath23 , and the upper bound is @xmath109 .",

    "( 1994 ) , which assume @xmath99 are also incompatible with the mass and distance of g04 .",
    "these models suggest that the mass would need to be at least @xmath110 or the distance would need to be less than @xmath111 in order to measure an inner radius consistent with @xmath99 .",
    "an additional way to retrieve a retrograde spin would be to lower @xmath4 to  1.0 , which is suggested by our measured value existing near the hard limit of 1.5 .",
