    "<S> we have investigated the electronic structure of zno : mn and zno : mn , n thin films using x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) and resonance - photoemission spectroscopy . from the mn </S>",
    "<S> 2@xmath0@xmath13@xmath2 xmcd results , it is shown that , while xmcd signals only due to paramagnetic mn@xmath3 ions were observed in zno : mn , nonmagnetic , paramagnetic and ferromagnetic mn@xmath3 ions coexist in zno : mn , n . </S>",
    "<S> xmcd signals of zno : mn , n revealed that the localized mn@xmath3 ground state and mn@xmath3 state hybridized with ligand hole coexisted , implying @xmath0-@xmath2 exchange coupling . in the valence - band spectra , </S>",
    "<S> spectral weight near the fermi level was suppressed , suggesting that interaction between magnetic moments in zno : mn , n has localized nature .    in the field of spintronics , it is essential to develop diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dmss ) with ferromagnetism at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical study @xcite based on zener s @xmath0-@xmath2 exchange model has predicted that wide - gap semiconductors such as mn - doped zno ( zno : mn ) are promising candidates for room temperature ferromagnetic dmss . </S>",
    "<S> however , experimental results obtained so far have not been mutually consistent , i.e. , some studies @xcite reported the observation of intrinsic ferromagnetism whereas others @xcite reported the absence of ferromagnetism or extrinsic ferromagnetism in these materials . </S>",
    "<S> recently , there has been works @xcite suggesting that structurally perfect zno : mn dmss do not exhibit ferromagnetic order . according to first - principles calculations </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , if carriers are not doped into zno : mn , antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction predominates so that the ground state is an insulating antiferromagnetic spin glass while ferromagnetism can be stabilized only by hole doping , e.g. , through n substitution for o. these reports imply that hole doping is necessary for ferromagnetism in zno : mn . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , ferromagnetism has been reported for n - doped zno : mn ( zno : mn , n ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , ferromagnetism has also been observed for @xmath4-type zno : mn @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus debatable whether ferromagnetism occurs only in a @xmath0-type zno : mn or not . in order to clarify the above issue </S>",
    "<S> , x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) is an ideal tool because xmcd is an element specific probe and the line shapes of xmcd spectra are fingerprints of magnetically active components . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , from the magnetic field dependence of xmcd signals , one can judge whether the xmcd signals come from ferromagnetism or not @xcite . in this paper , we show the magnetic field dependence of mn 2@xmath0@xmath13@xmath2 xmcd and resonance - photoemission spectroscpy spectra of the zno : mn , n sample and discuss the magnetic states of the doped mn ions and their electronic structures </S>",
    "<S> .    400-nm - thick thin films of zno : mn and its n - doped one ( mn=1 - 2% ) were grown on si substrates by reactive sputtering using 99.9% pure zn target using a radio frequency ( rf)/direct current ( dc ) sputtering system . the substrate temperature during deposition </S>",
    "<S> was maintained at 350 @xmath5c . </S>",
    "<S> the zno : mn , n film was prepared under n pressure of @xmath6 = 1.5 mbar . </S>",
    "<S> the films were deposited from separate metallic targets of zn and mn in our sputtering system which can accommodate up to three targets simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> these metal targets were independently characterized prior to the deposition , and found no evidence for any contamination . from low field ( @xmath7 50 oe ) , zero field cooled and field cooled measurements , we found no evidence for such phases and ruled out possible existence of mn oxide clusters as well . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we rule out impurity phases in the films by using the x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) and x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) and xmcd measurements were performed at the undulator beam line bl-23su of spring-8 and spectra were recorded in the total - electron - yield ( tey ) mode ( probing depth @xmath8 5 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of circular polarization was higher than @xmath8 95% . </S>",
    "<S> the monochromator resolution was @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11@xmath9 @xmath12 10000 . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic fields @xmath13 up to 8 t were applied perpendicular to the sample surface . </S>",
    "<S> rpes measurements in the mn 2@xmath0 - 3@xmath2 core - excitation regions were performed at bl-23su of spring-8 . </S>",
    "<S> all binding energies ( e@xmath14 ) were referenced to the fermi level ( e@xmath15 ) of the sample holder which was in electrical contact with the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy resolution of the rpes measurements was @xmath8170 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1(a ) shows comparison of the mn 2@xmath0@xmath13@xmath2 xas spectra of the zno : mn and zno : mn , n samples at @xmath13=0 t with cluster - model calculations @xcite for the high - spin mn@xmath3 , mn@xmath16 , and mn@xmath17 states in the @xmath18-symmetry crystal field . from the line - shape analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest that the doped mn ions in zno : mn and zno : mn , n are mostly in the high - spin mn@xmath3 states . </S>",
    "<S> next , we discuss the magnetically active component of zno : mn and zno : mn , n . </S>",
    "<S> figures 1(b ) and ( c ) show the mn 2@xmath0 - 3@xmath2 xas spectra , taken at @xmath13=8 t , using circular polarized x - rays and their difference spectrum , i.e. , xmcd spectra . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19@xmath20 and @xmath19@xmath21 refer to absorption spectra for photon helicity parallel and antiparallel to the mn 3@xmath2 spin , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the xmcd peak positions of zno : mn , n are the same as the xas peak positions , indicating that the xmcd signal is mainly due to the mn@xmath3 states . </S>",
    "<S> considering this and that the xmcd line shape of the zno : mn , n sample is similar to that of the zno : mn sample , we conclude that the magnetically active components both in zno : mn and zno : mn , n mainly come from the mn@xmath3 states .    figure 2(a ) </S>",
    "<S> shows the mn 2@xmath0@xmath13@xmath2 xmcd spectra of the zno : mn sample measured at various magnetic fields at @xmath22=10 k. it is shown that the peak positions of the xmcd spectra are independent of magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the intensities of xmcd signals are negligibly small at @xmath13=0.1 t and the xmcd signals increase with magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the xmcd intensities as a function of magnetic field are plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this figure indicates that the paramagnetic mn@xmath3 state exists in this sample and the ferromagnetic component is negligibly small because xmcd signals do not persist at @xmath13=0 as a remanence magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3(a ) shows the mn 2@xmath0@xmath13@xmath2 xmcd spectra of the zno : mn , n sample measured at various magnetic fields at @xmath22=10 k. we find that the paramagnetic mn@xmath3 state exists in this sample like in the zno : mn sample , because the xmcd signals increase with magnetic field , and the peak positions of the xmcd spectra are independent of magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can observe a small but clear xmcd signal of zno : mn , n at @xmath13=0.1 t as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> considering that the peak positions of the xmcd spectra are independent of magnetic field , the figure suggests the presence of ferromagnetic component due to the mn@xmath3 states . to confirm the ferromagnetism , the mn 2@xmath0@xmath13@xmath2 xmcd spectra measured at various magnetic fields at @xmath22=300 k </S>",
    "<S> are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> according to a currie - weiss law , it is expected that the paramagnetic component is reduced at room temperature and one can clearly see the ferromagnetic component . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(d ) , the finite xmcd signals persist at @xmath13 = 0 as a remanence magnetization , suggesting the presence of a small ferromagnetic component . from the magnetic field dependence of xmcd intensities , </S>",
    "<S> we have estimated the relative concentrations of the nonmagnetic , paramagnetic and ferromagnetic mn ions to be @xmath8 66 , 33 , and 1% , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that most of mn ions are in an effectively non - magnetic state .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we discuss the origin of the ferromagnetic component of zno : mn , n . considering that the ferromagnetic component of xmcd signal is due to mn@xmath3 ions , and mno ( mn@xmath3 ) is not ferromagnetic material @xcite , ferromagnetism due to secondary phases seems unlikely . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) , one can notice features denoted @xmath23 , which are located at 0.5 ev lower photon energy with respect to the main peak . considering the cluster - model calculation by edmonds @xmath24 @xmath25 . @xcite and an xmcd study @xcite of gaas : mn , we suggest that the feature denoted @xmath23 comes from a mn@xmath3 state hybridized with ligand - hole states , whereas the peak around @xmath26@xmath27@xmath8641.5 ev originates from the localized mn@xmath3 ground state . in the case of @xmath0-type doping , the mn - mn exchange coupling may be mediated by the presence of holes in the valence band which hybridize with the 3@xmath2 states of mn . </S>",
    "<S> the itinerant holes thereby retain their @xmath2-like character . therefore , hybridization between mn 3@xmath2 and ligand hole stabilizes the ferromagnetic phase for mn doping , i.e. , @xmath0-@xmath2 exchange coupling . assuming that hole </S>",
    "<S> is doped into the zno : mn , n film through n substitution for o , we suggest that the observed ferromagnetism is due to @xmath0-@xmath2 exchange coupling . if the doped holes are itinerant , it is expected that partial density of states ( pdos ) due to mn 3@xmath2 states have a finite value at fermi level @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we have performed the valence - photoemission study of zno : mn , n as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> all the spectra were taken using photon energies in the mn 2@xmath0@xmath13@xmath2 core - excitation region . </S>",
    "<S> labels a to g in the mn 2@xmath0@xmath13@xmath2 xas spectrum [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) ] indicate photon energies at which the spectra in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) were taken . by subtracting the off - resonance spectrum ( a ) from on - resonance one ( d ) , </S>",
    "<S> we have deduced the mn 3@xmath2 pdos as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> here , we also compare the experimental mn 3@xmath2 pdos with the theoretical spectrum calculated using the cluster model . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated spectrum has well reproduced with the experimental one , indicating that we have succeeded in deducing the mn 3@xmath2 pdos . </S>",
    "<S> for the mn 3@xmath2 pdos , no photoemission intensity was observed at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that the @xmath0-@xmath2 exchange interaction in zno : mn , n has the localized nature , reflecting a small amount of the doped n ions .    in conclusion , while xmcd signals only due to the paramagnetic component of the mn@xmath3 ions were observed for zno : mn , xmcd signals due to the paramagnetism and ferromagnetism of the mn@xmath3 ions were observed for zno : mn , n . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated relative concentrations of the nonmagnetic , paramagnetic and ferromagnetic mn ions were @xmath8 66 , 33 , and 1% , respectively , in the zno : mn , n sample . also , xmcd signal of zno : mn , </S>",
    "<S> n at 300 k revealed that the localized mn@xmath3 ground state and the mn@xmath3 state hybridized with ligand hole coexisted , implying the importance of @xmath0-@xmath2 exchange coupling for the ferromagnetism of zno : mn , n . from the rpes results </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest that the @xmath0-@xmath2 exchange interaction in zno : mn , n has localized nature , reflecting the small amount of the doped n ions .    </S>",
