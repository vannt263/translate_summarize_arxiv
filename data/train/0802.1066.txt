    "the paramagnetic , metallic ground state of heavy fermion compounds  @xcite can be interpreted as a fermi liquid with low coherence temperature and large effective mass .",
    "@xcite the origin of the coherence temperature lies in the nature of the quasiparticles , which emerge as a coherent superposition of the kondo screening clouds of the individual magnetic impurities .",
    "being a fermi liquid , the heavy fermion ground state is well captured by large-@xmath0 mean - field theories that predict a renormalized band structure ; at this level of approximation , the key properties  such as the effective mass and the fermi - surface topology  are reproduced .",
    "mean - field approaches that are static in time , however , do not properly incorporate kondo screening and hence do not account for the many - body nature of the quasiparticles .",
    "such approaches become questionable when the system is subject to perturbations , such as large temperatures or strong magnetic fields , that have the potential to destroy kondo screening  hence , the motivation to consider dynamical mean field theories ( dmft ) , where the kondo effect is built in .    the problem of a kondo lattice insulator ( symmetric conduction band at half - filling ) in a magnetic field has previously been treated approximately using dmft@xcite and exactly using quantum monte carlo .",
    "@xcite in that special case , the only important low - energy scale is the indirect gap separating upper and lower quasiparticle bands . in the metallic case ( e.g. , filling less than half ) , there is an additional , smaller energy scale given by the separation between the chemical potential and the top of the lower band .",
    "@xcite this scale is generically small _ regardless of the conduction band filling _ and controls the fermi liquid properties . as we shall see",
    ", it also sets the magnetic field scale for the onset of metamagnetic features .",
    "the static mean field scenario for application of a magnetic field at zero temperature is as follows . as the field strength",
    "is increased , the spin up quasiparticle bands descend .",
    "the spin up fermi surface shrinks to a point and disappears as the lower band drops below the chemical potential .",
    "@xcite the resulting half - metallic state  @xcite has mean field parameters that are locked at the values obtained before the disappearance of the spin up fermi surface and are completely insensitive to changes in the field .",
    "@xcite as a result , the physical magnetization @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the free energy ) has a constant slope proportional to the difference between the land @xmath5-factors for the two species . if the @xmath6- and @xmath7-electrons couple identically to the applied field , the system is predicted to exhibit a magnetization plateau at a value that depends only on the conduction band filling @xmath8 .",
    "note that the dimensionless magnetization @xmath9 always shows the plateau behaviour , irrespective of the values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this is related to the fact that , in the locked state , the system behaves as a gas of @xmath12 fully spin - polarized , heavy - quasiparticle holes .",
    "our dmft results verify this scenario .",
    "we find that the magnetization profile begins to develop an inflection at temperatures on the order of the predicted coherence temperature .",
    "this feature resembles a plateau smeared by temperature , and we have verified that it sharpens as the temperature is lowered . moreover ,",
    "the apparent height of the plateau is consistent with the predicted magnetization value .",
    "an analysis of the evolution of the spectral functions with applied field shows that the endpoints of the plateau do coincide with the chemical potential entering and leaving the hybridization gap .",
    "we consider the kondo lattice model ( klm ) on a square lattice in an external magnetic field @xmath13 : @xmath14 here , @xmath15 creates a conduction electron in an extended orbital with wavevector @xmath16 and spin projection @xmath17 along an axis of quantization chosen parallel to the applied field .",
    "the tight - binding dispersion relation is @xmath18 . at each lattice site @xmath19 , a local spin-1/2 degree of freedom @xmath20",
    "is coupled via @xmath21 to the @xmath6-electron spin density @xmath22 ( represented with the aid of the pauli spin matrices @xmath23 ) .",
    "an analogous expression can be written for @xmath20 using the localized orbital creation operators @xmath24 .",
    "since the klm forbids charge fluctuations on the @xmath7-orbitals , this representation demands that we impose a strict constraint of one electron per @xmath7-orbital .",
    "the dmft approximation neglects spatial fluctuations and thereby omits the @xmath16-dependence of the self - energy : i.e. ,  @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite being local , the self - energy is that of a single impurity in a bath described by the free hamilton operator @xmath26 . the corresponding local green bath function is given by @xmath27 using @xmath28 and the equivalent definition for @xmath29 .",
    "the prerequisite for the implementation of dmft is the ability to solve , for a given bath , the kondo model , @xmath30 in our calculations , we have opted for the hirsch - fye approach . following ref .  , we expand the hilbert space to permit charge fluctuations on the @xmath7-sites and replace the kondo term by @xmath31 at the expense of two discrete hubbard - stratonovich fields , we can decompose the ( perfect square ) hybridization and hubbard terms , and readily implement the above interaction within the framework of the hirsch - fye algorithm .",
    "@xcite in the limit @xmath32 , charge fluctuations on the @xmath7-orbitals are suppressed and the squared hybridization reduces to the desired kondo term .",
    "the efficiency of this approach lies in the fact that @xmath33 is a conserved quantity  @xcite for the considered class of @xmath34 , which does not include hybridization terms between the bath and impurity orbital .",
    "typically , @xmath35 suffices to ensure that double occupancy drops down to @xmath36 and that @xmath37 to the same precision .",
    "since charge fluctuations on the @xmath7-sites are suppressed by the hubbard interaction , the local green function , as obtained from the hirsch - fye alogorithm , is diagonal in the large-@xmath38 limit and is given by @xmath39    self - consistency requires that the local green function , as determined from the effective impurity problem , matches that of the lattice : @xmath40 here , @xmath41 is the free lattice green function [ corresponding to @xmath42 in eq .  ] .   to recover the kondo model . ]    hence , for a given bath green function @xmath43 , we extract the self - energy from the impurity solver and , exploiting eq .",
    ", recompute the bath green function with @xmath44 the procedure is repeated until convergence is achieved . as noted above , in the limit @xmath45 the local green function , self - energy , and bath green function are all diagonal . accordingly , the self - consistency [ see eq .  ] is equivalent to two scalar equations : @xmath46 the last equality follows from the fact that @xmath47 has no @xmath16 dependence .",
    "having determined the self - energy , one can readily compute the single particle green function @xmath48 and extract the spectral function @xmath49 with a stochastic analytical continuation method .",

    "the interaction of conducting electrons with local impurities often gives rise to complicated nonlinearities in magnetic response ( often described as metamagnetism ) . below the coherence temperature , we find that the magnetization profile of the kondo lattice system shows a plateau , whose onset is linked to the vanishing of the fermi surface in one spin sector .",

    "there is no evidence of this within dmft , and we expect that phase fluctuations of the hybridization field are responsible for washing out this false transition .    in closing , this work establishes that the metamagnetic behavior of kondo systems is intimately related to coherence .",

    "<S> the plateau appears at the field scale predicted by ( static ) large-@xmath0 mean field theory and has a magnetization value consistent with that of @xmath1 spin - polarized heavy holes , where @xmath2 is the conduction band filling of the noninteracting system . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the emergence of the plateau at low temperature marks the onset of quasiparticle coherence . </S>"
