    "in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xmath4 suppression has been recognized as an important tool to identify the possible phase transition to quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite . however , even if the qgp is not formed , the @xmath4 can be dissociated by many other `` comoving '' light hadrons which are produced in such collisions . therefore , the evaluation of the size of the @xmath4 cross section by light mesons is important to distinguish wheter the qgp is formed or the @xmath4 is dissociated by other `` comoving '' hadrons .",
    "since the cross section of @xmath4 dissociation by hadrons can not be directly measured , several theoretical approaches have been proposed to estimate their values .",
    "some approaches were based on charm quark - antiquark dipoles interacting with the gluons of a larger ( hadron target ) dipole @xcite or quark exchange between two ( hadronic ) bags @xcite , or qcd sum rules @xcite , whereas other works used the meson exchange mechanism @xcite .",
    "the meson exchange approach was applied to @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath1 , and @xmath7 cross sections @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , analyzing the @xmath7 cross section , we have shown that the inclusion of off - shell effects at the vertices , through the introduction of qcd sum rule estimates for the form factors , can change the energy dependence of the absorption cross section in a nontrivial way .",

    "( [ ff1 ] ) through ( [ ff2 ] ) might spoil the current conservation associated with the @xmath4 current . however , this is not the case .",
    "let us consider , for instance , the full amplitude associated with the processes represented by diagrams ( 1 ) in fig . 1 : @xmath63 . keeping only terms that will contribute to the cross section",

    "therefore , our prescription in keeping gauge invariance when the form factors from eqs ( [ ff1 ] ) to ( [ ff2 ] ) are introduced , is to introduce new terms , proporcional to @xmath68 , in the amplitude , as in eq .",

    ". we will be always including the contributions for both @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the cross section of @xmath4 dissociation by @xmath8 as a function of the initial energy @xmath40 . the dot - dashed , dotted , dashed , long - dashed and solid lines give the contributions for the processes @xmath71 @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and total respectively . from this figure we can see that the process @xmath76 has a different dependence with the energy near the threshold as compared with the processes @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this difference in the behaviour of the cross section can be understood by noticing that while for the process @xmath79 , @xmath80 is positive , for the other processes the mass difference between the initial and final states is negative .",

    "this means that we are now using the amplitudes given by eqs .",
    "( [ ff1 ] ) through ( [ ff2 ] ) .",
    "the first important conclusion is that the use of appropriate form factors do change the behavior of the cross section as a function of @xmath40 , as obtained in refs .",
    "the processes more affected by this change are the ones represented by diagrams ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in fig .  1 .",
    "while the total cross section obtained without form factors show a very strong grown with @xmath40 , this is not more the case when the total cross section is obtained with form factors , as can be seen in fig .  4 , where we show the total cross section evaluated with and without form factors .",
    "one important result of our calculation is the fact that , using appropriate form factors with cut - offs of order of @xmath86 ( see eqs.([h1 ] ) through ( [ h4 ] ) ) , the value of the cross section can be reduced by one order of magnitude .",
    "the same effect was obtained in refs .",

    "other important result that we can see by this figure is that , even with form factors , the @xmath89 dissociation cross section still increases with @xmath40 , differently to what happens with the @xmath90 dissociation cross section .",
    "the reason for that is the fact that , without form factors the @xmath89 dissociation cross section increases , with @xmath40 , in a much stronger way than the @xmath90 dissociation cross section , as can be seen by fig .",
