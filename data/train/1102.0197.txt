    "the biseparable bound on @xmath59 is thus equal to the two times the tsirelson bound of the 3-input chained bell inequality  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath149 , which is in agreement with eq .  .",

    "it is sufficient to compute the bound over all product correlations of the form @xmath151 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath152 is symmetric under any permutation of parties , it is sufficient to consider the biseparations @xmath153 , @xmath154 where @xmath155 . with obvious notation , we write the corresponding correlations as @xmath156 .",
    "bayes rule and the fact that quantum correlations satisfy the no - signaling principle allow us to write the quantum correlations for parties @xmath157 to @xmath158 as @xmath159 . with straightforward algebra",
    ", it can be seen that the quantity @xmath160 for this type of distribution can be rewritten as @xmath161 where the @xmath0-partite quantity @xmath162 depends on the values of @xmath163 and @xmath164 since it is evaluated on the distribution @xmath165 . inserting this expression in the definition @xmath166",
    ", we obtain @xmath167 where we have defined @xmath168 ( note that @xmath169 is different from zero only if @xmath170 ) and write @xmath171 to remind that @xmath172 is evaluated on the distribution @xmath165 which depends on @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath173 and that the probabilities @xmath174 are bounded between @xmath175 and @xmath176 , it follows from ( [ b5 ] ) that @xmath177 let @xmath178 denote the maximal value of the quantity @xmath179 taken by any biseparable correlations .",
    "since the distribution @xmath180 is biseparable , we clearly have that @xmath181 , independently of the values of @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "we thus find @xmath182    an important point to note now is that @xmath179 for all @xmath183 are equivalent to @xmath75 , i.e. , one can obtain the expression for @xmath75 by starting from any of @xmath179 and applying a different labeling for the inputs and/or outputs . to see that this is the case , we first note from the definition of @xmath71 that @xmath184 . in other words , we can obtain @xmath185 by starting from @xmath75 and applying the mapping @xmath186 to each of the @xmath187 .",
    "clearly , the same argument also demonstrates the equivalence between @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "next , note that if the following mappings are applied to the definition of @xmath187 , namely @xmath190 and @xmath191 except for @xmath192 in which case @xmath193 , then we can also obtain the expression for @xmath172 from @xmath194 , thus showing their equivalence .",
    "we thus have that @xmath195 and thus @xmath196 now , by the induction hypothesis we know that @xmath197 for all biseparable correlations .",
    "it then follows from eq .",
    "( [ b8 ] ) that @xmath198 , which completes the proof .",
    "note that , following the above reasoning , any witness for @xmath0 parties and @xmath24 inputs per party which can be written in the form @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is a function satisfying @xmath201 , can be generalized to more parties .",
    "note also that the above biseparable bound for the witness is tight , as it can always be achieved by performing the following local measurements @xmath202 with @xmath203 on the biseparable state @xmath204    finally , let us note that the same procedure as the one detailed above can be followed to obtain the ( no - signalling ) svetlichny bound of @xmath152 .",
    "the only difference is that in the first step of the induction proof , we must compute the no - signalling bound of the @xmath59 inequality instead of the quantum biseparable bound . as in the quantum biseparable case",
    ", this reduces to computing twice the ( bipartite ) no - signalling bound of the 3-input chained bell inequality , which gives @xmath205 and thus @xmath206 . to show that this bound is tight consider a strategy where the @xmath0-th party is separated from the rest and always outputs 1 . using an analysis similar to the one leading to eq .",
    ", we can then see that the remaining @xmath207 parties are playing an effective game defined by @xmath208 which can be shown to be equivalent to twice the expression @xmath209 .",
    "it is a simple exercise to show that the algebraic maximum of @xmath209 is @xmath210 and that this is always achievable by @xmath207 players that are constrained only by the no - signalling principle .",
    "therefore , with this particular strategy , one achieves @xmath211 , which saturates the bound derived above .",
    "here we present a biseparable model that simulates von neumann measurements on noisy tripartite ghz states [ eq : state ] = v2+(1-v)8 of visibility @xmath212 .",
    "clearly this allows to simulate states with @xmath213 as well , by mixing this model with another one in which all parties produce uniformly random outcomes .",
    "the model is presented as a protocol in which a source distributes quantum states and random variables to the parties .",
    "all parties can share the random variables , but since only biseparable states may be used in the model , not more than two parties at a time can share a quantum state . after distribution ,",
    "the parties receive their respective measurement directions @xmath214 , @xmath215 or @xmath216 belonging to the bloch sphere , and measure their quantum system and/or process the information they received accordingly in order to produce binary outcomes @xmath217 .",
    "we check that the outcomes produced by the model are identical to the ones found when measuring state in the given bases .",
    "before the parties receive their inputs , a common source chooses a party @xmath218 at random , say charlie ( @xmath219 ) , and sends him the vector = ( , , ) , uniformly chosen on the sphere @xmath220 .",
    "the source then also provides the two other parties , alice and bob in this case , with the quantum state [ eq : phiab ] |_ab=2|00 + 2 e^-i|11 .",
    "moreover , the source sends to all parties the signs @xmath221 , which are independently and identically distributed with @xmath222 .    at the time of measurement , alice and",
    "bob measure their system according to @xmath214 and @xmath215 and get outcomes @xmath223 , while charlie calculates @xmath224 .",
    "the parties then output respectively @xmath225 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "here we compare the correlations that are created when alice , bob and charlie apply the biseparable model above to the ones that they would get by measuring state  .",
    "since the model treats equally each party , its correlations are symmetric under exchange of the parties and we only need to check the following three relations : @xmath228 here we parametrized the parties measurements in terms of spherical coordinates : x=(_x_x,_x_x,_x ) and similarly for @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "for definiteness , in the following we use the brackets @xmath229 to express the expectation value of a quantity @xmath230 with respect to a quantum state , and the bar = 14_0 ^ 2 d_0^df ( , ) for the average of a function @xmath231 over the random variable @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "we always start by considering that charlie is the special party chosen by the source , to whom the hidden vector @xmath234 is sent , and perform the symetrization afterwards .",
    "symmetrized quantities @xmath235 are indexed by the symbol @xmath236 .    for simplicity we average over the depolarization signs @xmath237 only at the end of the calculation .",
    "[ [ single - party - expectation - value ] ] single - party expectation value + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    one can easily verify that the outcomes of each party is locally random according to the model , in agreement with equation .",
    "[ [ two - party - correlators ] ] two - party correlators + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    let us first calculate correlations @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 for the case in which charlie receives the vector @xmath234 , and average over the choice of the party @xmath218 being alone afterwards .    the first term is easily found from equation , which gives [ eq : ab ] ab = _ x _ y + _",
    "x_y(+_x+_y ) and thus @xmath241 .    to compute the correlation @xmath242",
    ", it is useful to write alice s state as _ a=_b(|_ab-2.8pt_ab|)=^22|0 - 2.8pt0|+^22|1 - 2.8pt1| .",
    "the expectation value for alice s outcome is then @xmath243 .",
    "concerning charlie , his outcome @xmath138 is totally determined by @xmath244 and @xmath216 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath245 , but the other situation can be treated similarly . in this case , for @xmath246 , charles always has @xmath247 , and for @xmath248 , he always has @xmath249 .",
    "now for @xmath250 $ ] , we can write @xmath251 $ ] the interval of @xmath233 for which the product @xmath252 , and @xmath253\\backslash \\mathcal{i}_+$ ] its complement , with @xmath254 . we thus have the three following cases :    1 .   @xmath255 . in this case",
    "@xmath247 , which gives @xmath256 .",
    "2 .   @xmath257 . in this case",
    "@xmath249 , which gives @xmath258 .",
    "3 .   @xmath259 . in this case one",
    "has @xmath260 where @xmath261 is the indicator function .    in total",
    ", after integration over @xmath232 and @xmath233 , this gives @xmath262 .",
    "similarly one can check that @xmath263 , and so once averaged over the choice of the party being alone , the bipartite correlations are given by @xmath264    finally , we need to apply the signs @xmath265 , @xmath266 , @xmath267 .",
    "since the expectation value of the product of two signs is @xmath268 , it follows that overall the correlation between two outcomes produced by the model is ab = 12_x_y , in agreement with equation .",
    "[ [ three - party - correlators ] ] three - party correlators + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we now proceed to calculate the tripartite correlations that are created by the model .",
    "let us consider the three preceding cases separately again :    1 .",
    "@xmath255 . in this case @xmath247 , so @xmath269 as given by equation .",
    "2 .   @xmath257 . in this case @xmath249",
    ", so @xmath270 .",
    "3 .   @xmath259 . in this case one",
    "has @xmath271 .    in total , the tripartite correlation",
    "are found after integration over @xmath232 and @xmath233 to be = 12_x_y_z(_x+_y+_z ) , which does not depend on which party @xmath218 is alone .",
    "one can check that the application of the signs @xmath272 has no influence on the tripartite correlations since they cancel out , and so @xmath273 .",
    "the model thus reproduces the expected correlations .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite how to define a hierarchy of sdp that characterizes the set @xmath51 of bipartite quantum correlations .",
    "note that biseparable quantum correlations @xmath28 can be written as a finite sum of such bipartite quantum correlations using the fact that each @xmath274 in ( [ eq : svetq ] ) can be taken to be extremal and using the fact that there are a finite number of such extremal points corresponding to classical , deterministic strategies .",
    "it therefore follows that biseparable quantum correlations can be characterized using a finite number of the sdp hierarchies introduced in @xcite .",
    "note however that the number of single - party deterministic strategies , and thus the number of terms in eq .  , grows exponentially with the number of measurement settings , making such an approach impractical even for small problems .",
    "here we introduce an alternative sdp approach that has better scaling properties .",
    "our approach is based on the observation that the tensor product separation @xmath91 at the level of states can be replaced by a commutation relation at the level of operators .",
    "specifically , let @xmath92 denote the three possible partitions of the parties into two groups .",
    "then , @xmath28 are biseparable quantum correlations if and only if there exist three arbitrary ( not necessarily biseparable ) states @xmath93 and three sets of measurement operators @xmath94 such that ( [ eq : decomp ] ) holds , i.e.          let us start by showing that any correlations of the form is of the form .",
    "note first the well - known fact that if the dimension of the hilbert space is not fixed , any single - party correlations @xmath274 admits a quantum representation @xmath275 $ ] where the operators @xmath45 commute among themselves .",
    "indeed , let @xmath276 and @xmath277 , then a quantum representation of @xmath274 is achieved by defining @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "we can thus write in eq .",
    "( [ eq : svetq ] ) , e.g. , @xmath280 $ ] with the operators @xmath34 commuting between themselves .",
    "the decomposition ( [ eq : svetq ] ) is thus clearly a particular case of ( [ aeq : decomp ] ) .",
    "let us now show the converse .",
    "let us suppose first that @xmath281 and let @xmath276 .",
    "since the projectors @xmath282 commute , the projectors @xmath283 defines a valid measurement and thus @xmath284 $ ] is a proper ( unormalized ) state of system @xmath144 .",
    "define @xmath285 $ ] and @xmath286 as the deterministic point satisfying @xmath287 .",
    "it is then easy to see using the properties of the operators @xmath282 that @xmath288=\\sum_{\\overline{c } } \\delta(c_z , c)\\text{tr}[m_{a|x}\\otimes m_{b|y}\\otimes m_{\\overline{c } } \\,\\rho^s]=\\sum_{\\overline{c}}\\delta(c_z , c)\\text{tr}[m_{a|x}\\otimes m_{b|y } \\rho_{\\overline{c}}]=\\sum_{\\overline{c}}p^{\\overline{c}}_q(ab|xy)p^{\\overline{c}}(c|z)$ ] .",
    "this last expression is of the same form as the first series of terms in ( [ eq : svetq ] ) ( since any deterministic point @xmath286 can be seen as a single - party quantum point @xmath137 ) .",
    "a similar argument for the other values of @xmath289 implies that any correlations of the form ( [ aeq : decomp ] ) are of the form ( [ eq : svetq ] ) .",
    "we thus have reduced the problem of determining whether given correlations @xmath28 are biseparable to the problem of finding a set of operators satisfying a finite number of algebraic relations ( the projection defining relations of the type @xmath96 , @xmath97 and the commutation relations ) such that ( [ aeq : decomp1 ] ) holds .",
    "such a problem is a typical instance of the sdp approach introduced in @xcite , which generalizes the results of @xcite .",
    "specifically , it follows from the decomposition ( [ aeq : decomp ] ) and the results of @xcite that it is possible to define an infinite hierarchy of sets @xmath290 with the following properties : @xmath18 deciding whether given correlations belongs to @xmath291 can be determined using sdp ( though the size of the sdp increases with @xmath6 ) ; @xmath19 the sets @xmath291 approximate better and better @xmath48 from the outside , i.e. , @xmath292 and @xmath293 for all @xmath6 . if given correlations are found not to belong to some @xmath294",
    ", we can thus conclude that they do not belong to @xmath48 and that they reveal genuinely tripartite entanglement .",
    "further , it is possible in this case to derive an associated diew from the solution of the dual sdp .",
    "note that modulo the assumption that the tensor product between the three measurement operators in ( [ aeq : decomp1 ] ) is equivalent to the commutation of these operators  an assumption that is true in finite - dimensional hilbert space , but which still represents an open question in an infinite - dimensional hilbert space  it can be shown that the hierarchy of relaxations converges to the set of biseparable states , i.e. , @xmath295 . thus if given correlations are not biseparable this will necessarily show - up at some finite step in the hierarchy ."

    "<S> * using finite levels of this hierarchy and optimizing over the possible measurements , we investigated the minimal visibilities above which the ghz state @xmath98 and the w state @xmath99 exhibit correlations that are not biseparable ( and thus reveal genuine tripartite entanglement ) in the case of two and three measurement settings per party . </S>",

    "<S> on the other hand , our numerical explorations suggest that the visibilities @xmath100 for ghz states with three measurements and @xmath103 for w states with two measurements can not be attained using the notion of genuine tripartite non - locality , illustrating the interest of the weaker notion of diew .    </S>",

    "<S> first of all , note that by identifying the measurement settings `` @xmath104 '' with @xmath105 and `` @xmath106 '' with @xmath107 , the two - setting diew based on mermin expression ( [ mermin ] ) can be written as @xmath108 , which is of the same general form as the three - setting diew ( [ eq : witness ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the diews based on ( [ mermin ] ) and ( [ eq : witness ] ) actually form part of a larger family of @xmath24-settings diews . </S>",
    "<S> this question deserves further investigation . </S>",
    "<S> a second problem is to derive simple diews that are adapted to w states and that can in particular reproduce the threshold visibilities obtained in table  1 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have shown a practical method to characterize three - partite biseparable correlations using sdp . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to understand how to generalize these results to the @xmath0-partite case . </S>",
    "<S> a possibility would be to combine the approach of @xcite with the symmetric extensions introduced in @xcite . </S>",
