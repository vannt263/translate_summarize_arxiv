    "the self - tangency point at which the branches are propagating in the same direction does not occur for the simple physical reason that if it appears on the front , then the two branches stay tangent during the whole propagation process and hence were tangent on the initial front .",

    "these observations make the study of legendrian curves in @xmath9 started by v. arnold a very attractive subject .",

    "the pieces into which the dangerous self - tangency stratum is decomposed are in a natural one - to - one correspondence with the connected components arising under the normalization of the part of the discriminant containing dangerous self - tangency points .",
