    "at present quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) can notexplain the origin of significant transverse single spin asymmetry(@xmath9 ) in partonic interactions .",
    "collinear factorized perturbativeqcd ( pqcd ) calculations at leading twist predict these analyzingpowers to be entirely negligible , due to chirality in the theory .",
    "however , experimental data @xcite shows that @xmath9 for inclusive particle production is on the order of @xmath10 independent of the center of mass energy ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "to improvethe situation theorists develop several models in a generalized version of the qcd factorization scheme , which allows for intrinsic transverse motion of partons inside hadrons , and of hadrons relatively to fragmenting partons .",
    "this adds new possibilities of spin effects , absent for collinear configurations .",
    "sivers @xcite proposed as a source of spin effects to be a flavor dependent correlation between the proton spin ( @xmath12),momentum ( @xmath13 ) and transverse momentum ( @xmath14 ) of the unpolarized partons inside the proton .",
    "this results in the new polarized parton distribution function : @xmath15 where @xmath16 - unpolarized distribution function , @xmath17 - sivers function and @xmath0 is the bjorken scaling variable .",
    "also significant @xmath9 could be produced by the correlation between the quark spin ( @xmath18 ) , momentum ( @xmath19 ) and transverse momentum ( @xmath14 ) of the pion in the final state .",
    "such an approach has been introduced by collins @xcite .",
    "then the fragmentation function of transversely polarized quark @xmath20 takes the form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 - unpolarized fragmentation function , @xmath23 -collins function and @xmath24 is longitudinal component of pion momentum . along with collins and sivers mechanisms",
    "there are higher twist effects in either initial @xcite or final @xcite state which may cause the observed analyzing powers .",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national lab ( bnl ) provides collisions of polarized protons at the energy of @xmath2 gev since 2002 . at 2005 first 410 gev collisions of polarized protons",
    "have been detected .",
    "the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star @xcite ) consists mainly of a large volume tpc , forward tpc , beam beam counters ( bbc ) , endcap electromagnetic calorimeter ( eemc ) , barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) and forward pion detector ( fpd ) .",
    "this contribution will focus on results from fpd and bbc , which located in the very forward region of star coverage .",
    "bbc are segmented scintillator detectors surrounding the beam pipe .",
    "it provides the minimum bias trigger , absolute luminosity and relative luminosity for our experiment . in addition bbc coincidences",
    "are used to suppress beam gas background .",
    "fpd is a set of eight calorimeters of lead glass cells with size of 3.8 @xmath25 @xmath26 cm .",
    "it provides triggering and reconstruction of neutral pions .",
    "four of them are left - right detectors and @xmath27 arrays cells .",
    "four others are top - bottom @xmath28 arrays and are useful for systematics studies .",
    "by definition single spin asymmetry is : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 - polarization of transversely polarized beam , @xmath31 - differential cross section of @xmath3 when incoming proton has spin up ( down ) .",
    "one can measure @xmath9 by two different ways .",
    "first with the use of single arm calorimeter : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 - the number of pions detected when the polarization of the beam is oriented up(down ) and @xmath34 is the spin dependent relative luminosity measured by bbc .",
    "second with the use of two arms calorimeter (  cross - ratio  method ) : @xmath35 , where@xmath36 - number of pions detected by the left ( right ) calorimeter while the beam has spin up and @xmath37 - number of pions detected by the left ( right ) calorimeter while the beam has spin down . in this method",
    "one does not need the relative luminosity .",
    "the asymmetries from these two measurements were found to be consistent .",
    "positive ( negative ) @xmath1 is defined when the pion is observed with the same ( opposite ) longitudinal momentum as the polarized beam .",
    "positive @xmath9 is defined as more @xmath3 going left of the upward polarized beam . in the 2002 proton run @xmath38 pb@xmath39 of integrated luminosity was collected for transversely polarized proton collisions at @xmath2 gev at an average polarization of @xmath40@xmath41 . in 2003 run the integrated luminosity and average polarization have been increased to @xmath42 pb@xmath39 and @xmath43@xmath41 respectively . in 2005(run 5 )",
    "we collected 0.4 pb@xmath39 of @xmath2 gev data with polarization of @xmath44 .",
    "the polarization was measured by pc cnipolarimeter @xcite .",
    "all mentioned values of polarization arebased on the online results from cni polarimeter .    earlier result from published 2002 data for @xmath45@xcite consistent with measurements at lower @xmath46gev ( e704 experiment ) and increasing with @xmath1 .",
    "it also can be described by all theoretical predictions mentioned above due to statistical uncertainties .",

    "the first measurement of @xmath9 at negative @xmath1 has been done , and is found to be zero .",
    "negative @xmath1 results may give an upper limit on the gluon sivers function @xcite . using the same analysis as in run3 we extracted analyzing power from run5 .",

    ", we will be able to achieve at least three physics objectives : a measurement of the gluon density distributions in gold nuclei for @xmath77 ; characterization of correlated pion cross sections as a function of @xmath53 to search for the onset of gluon saturation effects associated with macroscopic gluon fields ; measurements with transversely polarized protons that are expected to resolve the origin of the large transverse spin asymmetries in @xmath78 reactions for forward @xmath3 production .",
