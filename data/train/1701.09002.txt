    "the underlying interaction graph @xmath1 with its set of nodes ( vertices ) @xmath2 and links ( edges ) @xmath3 consists of three interconnected subgraphs , the gene regulatory domain @xmath4 , the interface domain @xmath5 and the metabolic domain @xmath6 . from the functional perspective , @xmath7 is the union of gene regulatory ( @xmath4 ) and metabolic processes ( @xmath6 ) , and their interactions and preparatory steps form the interface ( @xmath5 )",
    ". figure  [ fig : sketch ] shows a sketch of the network model .    a sketch of the domain organization of the integrative _ e.  coli _ network .",
    "the regulatory domain , @xmath4 , at the top is connected to the metabolic domain , @xmath6 , shown at the bottom via a protein - interface layer , @xmath5 .",
    "the figure shows the number of vertices within and the number of edges within and between the domains . for illustrative purposes snapshots of the largest weakly - connected components of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    "are included in the figure . ]",
    "the integrated network representation has been assembled based on the database ( version 18.5 ; @xcite ) which offers both data about metabolic processes and ( gene ) regulatory events incorporated from the corresponding regulondb release 8.7 @xcite .",
    "the extensive metadata allows for the assignment of the vertices to one of the three functional domains .",
    "details of this process and a detailed characterization of the resulting model will be described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the corresponding graph representation consists of @xmath8 vertices and @xmath9 directed edges .",
    "since we are interested in the propagation of a signal between the domains , in the following we will refer to the domains of the source and target vertices of the edge @xmath10 as _ source domain _ , sd , and _ target domain _ , td , respectively .",
    "the metadata can be used to assign properties to the nodes and edges of the graph beyond the domain structure , some of which are used in the following analysis , namely in the construction of the propagation rules of the system and of the randomization schemes .",
    "we distinguish between biological categories of edges ( capturing the diverse biological roles of the edges ) and the logical categories ( determining the rules of the percolation process ) . according to their biological role in the system , both vertices and edges",
    "are assigned to a _",
    "biological _ category ; we abbreviate the _ biological category of a vertex _ as bcv and the _ biological category of an edge _ as bce ( for details see supplementary materials ) .",
    "each of the eight bces can then be mapped uniquely to one of only three _ logical categories of an edge _ , lce , @xmath11 which are of central importance for the spreading dynamics in our system :    c , conjunct : :    the target vertex of an edge with this logical ` and ` property depends    on the source node , i.e. , it will fail once the source node fails . for    example",
    ", for a reaction to take place , all of its educts have to be    available .",
    "d , disjunct : :    edges with this logical ` or ` property are considered redundant in the    sense that a vertex only fails if the source vertices of all of its    incoming d - edges fail . for instance , a compound will only become    unavailable once all of its producing reactions have been canceled .",
    "r , regulation : :    edges of this category cover @xmath12 different kinds of    regulatory events ( described in detail in the supplementary    materials ) .",
    "as shown below , in terms of the propagation dynamics we    treat these edges similar to the conjunct ones .",
    "next we describe the dynamical rules for the propagation of an initial perturbation in the network in terms of the logical categories of an edge ( lce ) , which distinguish between the different roles a given edge has in the update of a target vertex .",
    "every vertex is assigned a boolean state variable ; since we intend to mimic the propagation of a perturbation ( rather than simulate a trajectory of actual biological states ) we identify the state @xmath13 with _ not yet affected by the perturbation _ while the state @xmath14 corresponds to _ affected by the perturbation_. we stress that the trajectory @xmath15 does not correspond to the time evolution of the abundance of gene products and metabolic compounds , but the rules have been chosen such that the final set of affected nodes provides an estimate of all nodes potentially being affected by the initial perturbation .",
    "a node not in this set is topologically very unlikely of being affected by the perturbation at hand ( given the biological processes contained in our model ) .",
    "a stepwise update can now be defined for vertex @xmath16 with in - neighbours @xmath17 in order to study the spreading of perturbations through the system by initially switching off a fraction @xmath18 of vertices : @xmath19{.5\\columnwidth}{$        \\left[\\sum_j c_{ij }        ( 1-\\sigma_j ) = 0\\right ] \\wedge \\ ; \\left[\\sum_j d_{ij }        \\sigma_j > 0 \\vee \\sum_j d_{ij}=0 \\right ] \\;\\wedge \\ ;        \\left[\\sum_j |r_{ij}| ( 1-\\sigma_j ) = 0\\right ]      $ }      \\\\ 0 &      \\text{otherwise }    \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is @xmath13 if @xmath21 is connected to @xmath22 via a c - link and @xmath14 otherwise ; @xmath23 and @xmath24 are defined analogously .",
    "thus , a vertex will be considered unaffected by the perturbation if none of its in - neighbours connected via either a @xmath25 or an @xmath26 edge have failed ( regardless of the sign of the regulatory interaction ) , and at least one of its in - neighbours connected via a @xmath27 edge is still intact . with an additional rule",
    "it is ensured that an initially switched off vertex stays off .",
    "the choice of the update rules ensures that the unperturbed system state is conserved under the dynamics : @xmath28 .    as a side remark ,",
    "the spreading of a perturbation according to the rules defined above could also be considered as an epidemic process with one set of connections with a very large , and a second set of connections with a very low probability of infection @xcite .",
    "in systems which can be described without explicit dependencies between its constituents but with a notion of functionality that coincides with connectivity , percolation theory is a method of first choice to investigate the system s response to average perturbations of a given size that can be modelled as failing vertices or edges @xcite the fractional size of the giant connected component as a function of the occupation probability @xmath29 of a constituent typically vanishes at some critical value @xmath30 , the percolation threshold . in the following",
    ", we will mostly use the complementary quantity @xmath31 so that @xmath32 can be interpreted as the critical size of the initial attack or perturbation of the system .",
    "the strong fluctuations of the system s responses in the vicinity of this point can serve as a proxy for the percolation threshold , which is especially useful in finite systems in which the transition appears smoothed out . in our analysis , the susceptibility @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the size of the largest cluster , is used @xcite .    upon the introduction of explicit dependencies between the system s constituents ,",
    "the percolation properties can change dramatically .",
    "the order parameter no longer vanishes continuously but typically jumps at @xmath30 in a discontinuous transition @xcite as cascades of failures fragment the system .",
    "a broader degree distribution now enhances a graph s vulnerability to random failures , in opposition to the behavior in isolated graphs @xcite .",
    "details of the corresponding theoretical framework have been worked out by parshani _ _ et al .  _ _",
    "@xcite , son _ _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite , baxter _",
    "_ et al .  _",
    "_ @xcite and more recently the notion of networks of networks has been included @xcite .",
    "there have also been attempts to integrate this class of models into the framework of multilayer networks @xcite .",
    "in addition to random node failure other procedures for initial node removal have been explored , e.g. ,  node removal with respect to their degree ( targeted attacks ) @xcite .",
    "currently , two notions of _ localized _ attacks have been described .",
    "attacks of the first sort are defined on spatially embedded networks and are local with respect to a distance in this embedding , i.e.  in a geographical sense @xcite .",
    "the second approach considers locality in terms of connectivity : around a randomly chosen seed , neighbours are removed layer by layer @xcite . in contrast , as described below in our approach , attacks are localized with respect to the three network domains , while within the domains nodes are chosen randomly .",
    "at this point we would like to shortly comment on the applicability of the mathematical concepts of interdependent networks to real - world data .",
    "aiming at analytical tractability , typical model systems need to choose a rather high level of abstraction .",
    "while certainly many systems can be accurately addressed in that way , we argue that especially in the case of biological systems the theoretical concepts can require substantial adjustment to cover essential properties of the system at hand .",
    "when asking for the systemic consequences of interdependency , the distinction between several classes of nodes and links may be required .",
    "effectively , some classes of links may then represent simple connectivity , while others can rather be seen as dependence links . in biology ,",
    "such dependencies are typically mediated by specific molecules ( e.g. , a small metabolite affecting a transcription factor , or a gene encoding an enzyme catalyzing a biochemical reaction ) . such implementations of dependence links are no longer just associations and it is hard to formally distinguish them from the functional links .    in contrast to the explicitly alternating percolation and dependency steps in typical computational models in which the decoupling of nodes from the largest component yields dependent nodes to fail , in our directed model both , connectivity and dependency links are evaluated in every time step and ( apart from nodes failing due to dependency ) only fully decoupled vertices cause further dependency failures .",
    "due to the functional three - domain partition of our _ e.  coli _ gene regulatory and metabolic network reconstruction , we have the possibility to classify perturbations not only according to their size , but also with respect to their localization in one of the domains comprising the full interdependent system , thereby enabling us to address the balance of sensitivity and robustness of the interdependent network of gene regulation and metabolism .    here",
    "we introduce the concept of network response to localized perturbations analysis .",
    "this analysis will reveal that perturbations in gene regulation affect the system in a dramatically different way than perturbations in metabolism .",
    "thus we study the response to _ localized _ perturbations .",
    "we denote such perturbations by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the domain , in which the perturbation is localized ( @xmath37 , with @xmath38 representing the total network @xmath7 , i.e. , the case of non - localized perturbations ) .",
    "the perturbation size @xmath31 is measured in fractions of the total network size @xmath39 .",
    "a perturbation @xmath40 thus is a perturbation in the metabolic domain with ( on average ) @xmath41 nodes initially affected .",
    "note that sizes @xmath18 of such localized perturbations are limited by the domain sizes , e.g. , @xmath42 for a perturbation in the gene regulatory domain .",
    "after the initial removal of a fraction @xmath18 of the vertices from the domain @xmath36 the stepwise dynamics described above will lead to the deactivation of further nodes and run into a frozen state @xmath43 in which only a fraction @xmath44 of the vertices are unaffected by the perturbation ( i.e. , are still in state @xmath13 ) .",
    "in addition to being directly affected by failing neighbors , in the process of network fragmentation nodes may also become parts of small components disconnected from the network s core , and could in this sense be considered non - functional ; we therefore also monitor the relative sizes of the largest ( weakly ) connected component in the frozen state , @xmath45 , for different initial perturbation sizes .    in the limit of infinite system size we could expect a direct investigation of @xmath45 as a function of @xmath18 to yield the critical perturbation size @xmath32 at which @xmath46 vanishes . in our finite system",
    ", however , we have to estimate @xmath47 ; following radicchi and castellano @xcite and radicchi @xcite we measure the fluctuation of @xmath45 which serves as our order parameter and look for the peak position of the susceptibility @xmath48 as a function of parameter @xmath18 in order to estimate the transition point from the finite system data .",
    "supplementary figure  [ fig : overview ] schematically illustrates the analysis .",
    "in order to interpret the actual responses of a given network to perturbations , one usually contrasts them to those of suitably randomized versions of the network at hand .",
    "thereby , the often dominant effect of the node degree distribution of a network can be accounted for and the effects of higher - order topological features that shape the response of the network to perturbations can be studied systematically .    the same is true for the localized perturbation response analysis introduced here .",
    "in fact , due to the substantially larger number of links from gene regulation to metabolism ( both , directly and via the interface component of the interdependent network ) than from metabolism to gene regulation we can already expect the response to such localized perturbations to vary .    here",
    "we employ a sequence of ever more stringent randomization schemes to generate sets of randomized networks serving as null models for the localized perturbation response analysis . in all of the four schemes the edge - switching procedure introduced by maslov and sneppen @xcite",
    "is employed which conserves the in- and out - degrees of all vertices .",
    "our most flexible randomization scheme ( domain ) only considers the domains of the source and target vertices of an edge ( sd and td ) : only pairs of edges are flipped which share both , the source and the target domain ( e.g. , both link a vertex in the metabolic domain to a vertex in the interface ) .",
    "the remaining three randomization schemes all add an additional constraint .",
    "the domain_lce randomization further requires the edges to be of the same logical categories of an edge ( i.e. , c , d , or r ) , while the domain_bcv scheme only switches edges whose target vertices also share the same biological category of a vertex , bcv .",
    "the strictest randomization , domain_bce , finally , only considers edges with , additionally , the same biological category of an edge , bce",
    ". a tabular overview of the four schemes is given in supplementary table [ tab : randschemes ] .",
    "the main feature of our reconstructed network , the three - domain structure based on the biological role of its constituents , allows us to study the influence of localizing the initial perturbation .",
    "thus , although we will not focus on ( topological ) details of the graph here ( which will be presented elsewhere @xcite ) , already from the vertex and edge counts in figure  [ fig : sketch ] we see that the domains are of different structure . while the regulatory and the metabolic subgraphs , @xmath4 and @xmath6 have average ( internal ) degrees of about @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the interface subgraph , @xmath5 , is very sparse with @xmath51 and we can expect it to be fragmented .",
    "hence , in the following we decide to only perturb in @xmath4 and @xmath6 .    in a first step we sample some full cascade trajectories in order to check our expectation of different responses of the system to small perturbations applied in either @xmath4 or @xmath6 ; two rather large values of @xmath18",
    "are chosen and the raw number of unaffected nodes is logged during the cascade .",
    "indeed , already this first approach implies a different robustness of the gene regulatory and the metabolic domains in terms of the transmission of perturbation cascades to the other domains .",
    "cascades seeded in the metabolic domain of the network tend to be rather restricted to this domain , while the system seems much more susceptible to small perturbations applied in the gene regulatory domain .",
    "this effect can be seen both in the overall sizes of the aggregated cascades as well as in the domain which shows the largest change with respect to the previous time step , which we indicate by black markers in figure  [ fig : states ] .",
    "more sample trajectories are shown in the supplementary materials and , although they illustrate occasionally large fluctuations between the behaviors of single trajectories , they are consistent with this first observation . they also show that considerably larger metabolic perturbations are needed for large cascades and back - and - forth propagation between domains to emerge .",
    "after this first glance at the system we aim for a more systematic approach and apply our analysis as described above : we compute cascade steady - states @xmath43 but now we choose the largest ( weakly ) connected component @xmath45 as the order parameter and compute the susceptibility according to equation @xmath52 , the peak - position of which , when considered as a function of @xmath31 , we use as a proxy for the perturbation size at which the interdependent system breaks down .",
    "the results for different initially perturbed domains illustrate that , indeed , a considerably lower @xmath30 ( i.e. , larger critical perturbation size @xmath47 ) is estimated in the case of metabolic perturbations compared to regulatory or non - localized ones ( figure  [ fig : suscept ] , panel a ) . for each point",
    "we average @xmath53 runs for the corresponding set of parameters .    in order to assess whether the above - described behavior is due to specific properties of the network we use the sets of randomized graphs",
    "for each of the four randomization schemes we prepared @xmath53 graph instances and repeated the analysis for each of them as done before for the single original graph .",
    "the corresponding results for the susceptibility ( figure  [ fig : suscept ] , panels b  e ) yield two major observations : firstly , metabolic perturbations still lead to , albeit only slightly , higher @xmath32 estimates ( with exception of domain randomization ) .",
    "thus , the system s tendency to be more robust towards metabolic perturbations is largely preserved .",
    "secondly , we see that overall the original network seems to be much more robust than the randomized networks ; very small perturbations are sufficient to break the latter ones .",
    "the robustness of the original graph , thus , can not be solely due to the edge and vertex properties kept in the randomization schemes .",
    "the susceptibility of the integrative _ e.  coli _ model and its randomized versions for perturbations in different domains .",
    "the results for the original graph are shown in the _ top _ frame , while the subsequent frames show results for the four different randomization schemes with the least strict on top and the strictest one at the bottom .",
    "the original system is more robust than its randomized versions ; perturbations in the metabolism consistently need to be larger than in the regulatory part in order to reach the maximum susceptibility . ]    finally , let us focus on the practical aspect of these findings . beyond the careful statistical analysis described above , a quantity of practical relevance is the average size of the unaffected part of the system under a perturbation . for this purpose",
    ", we examine the fractions of unaffected vertices , @xmath44 , after cascades emanating from perturbations of different sizes and seeded in different domains , regardless of the resulting component structure and for both , the original graph and the shuffled ones ( figure  [ fig : frac ] ) .",
    "mean fractions ( averaged over @xmath54 runs ) of unaffected vertices after initial perturbations of different sizes seeded in the gene regulatory ( filled green dots ) and in the metabolic domain ( filled red squares ) .",
    "the curves at the bottom show the averaged results over @xmath53 shuffles for each randomization scheme . ]",
    "the number of unaffected vertices for the real network is much larger than for all four randomization schemes , suggesting a strong overall robustness of the biological system .",
    "distinguishing , however , between the metabolic and the gene regulatory components reveals that the metabolic part is substantially more robust than the regulatory part ( for not too large initial perturbations , @xmath55 ) .",
    "we investigated the spreading of perturbations through the three domains of a graph representation of the integrated system of _",
    "e.  coli _ s gene regulation and metabolism .",
    "our results quantify the resulting cascading failures as a function of size and localization of the initial perturbation .",
    "our findings show that the interdependent network of gene regulation and metabolism unites sensitivity and robustness by showing different magnitudes of damage dependent on the site of perturbation .",
    "while the interdependent network of these two domains is in general much more robust than its randomized variants ( retaining domain structure , degree sequence , and major biological aspects of the original system ) , a pronounced difference between the gene regulatory and metabolic domain is found : small perturbations originating in the gene regulatory domain typically trigger far - reaching system - wide cascades , while small perturbations in the metabolic domain tend to remain more local and trigger much smaller cascades of perturbations .    in order to arrive at a more mechanistic understanding of this statistical observation ,",
    "we estimated the percolation threshold of the system , @xmath30 , and found that it is much lower ( i.e , larger perturbations , @xmath32 , are required ) for perturbations seeded in the metabolic domain than for those applied to the gene regulatory domain .",
    "this is in accordance with the intuition that the metabolic system is more directly coupled to the environment ( via the uptake and secretion of metabolic compounds ) than the gene regulatory domain .",
    "the distinct perturbation thresholds therefore allow for implementing a functionally relevant balance between robustness and sensitivity : the biological system can achieve a robustness towards environmental changes , while  via the more sensitive gene regulatory domain  it still reacts flexibly to other systemic perturbations .    discovering this design principle of the biological system required establishing a novel method of analyzing the robustness of interdependent networks , the network response to localized perturbations : an interdependent network can have markedly different percolation thresholds , when probed with perturbations localized in one network component compared to another .",
    "lastly , we would like to emphasize that the application of the theoretical concepts of interdependent networks to real - life systems involves several non - trivial decisions :    in the vast majority of ( theoretical ) investigations , two definitions of interdependent networks coincide : the one derived from a distinction between dependency links and connectivity - representing links and the one based on two functionally distinguishable , but interconnected subnetworks .    here",
    "we have three classes of nodes : those involved in gene regulation , metabolic nodes , and nodes associated with the ( protein ) interface between these two main domains .",
    "these nodes are interconnected with ( functionally ) different classes of links .",
    "these link classes are necessary to define meaningful update rules for perturbations . as a consequence , the notion of dependency links vs.  connectivity links is no longer applicable .",
    "we expect that such adjustments of the conceptual framework will often be required when applying the notion of interdependent networks to real - life systems .",
    "as mentioned above , one major task when dealing with biological data is to abstract from the minor but keep the essential details ; we have outlined that in this study we chose to keep a rather high level of detail .    with only incomplete information available ,",
    "a challenge is to find the right balance between radical simplifications of systemic descriptions and an appropriate level of detail still allowing for a meaningful evaluation of biological information .",
    "here we incorporate high level of detail in the structural description , distinguishing between a comparatively large number of node and link types .",
    "this rich structural description , together with a set of update rules motivated by general biological knowledge , allows us to assess the dynamical / functional level with the comparatively simple methods derived from percolation theory .",
    "an important question is , whether the analysis of the fragmentation of such a network under random removal of nodes can provide a reliable assessment of functional properties , since the response of such a molecular network clearly follows far more intricate dynamical rules than the percolation of perturbations can suggest .",
    "a future step could include the construction of a boolean network model for the full transcriptional regulatory network and the connection of this model to flux predictions obtained via flux balance analysis , a first attempt of which is given in samal and jain @xcite ( where the model of covert _",
    "_ et al .  _",
    "_ @xcite with still fewer interdependence links has been used ) .",
    "our perturbation spreading approach might help bridging the gap between theoretical concepts from statistical physics and biological data integration : integrating diverse biological information into networks , estimating response patterns to systemic perturbations and understanding the multiple systemic manifestations of perturbed , pathological states is perceived as the main challenge in systems medicine ( see , e.g. , bauer _",
    "_ et al .  _",
    "_ @xcite ) .",
    "concepts from statistical physics of complex networks may be of enormous importance for this line of research @xcite .    while the simulation of the full dynamics is still problematic as our knowledge of the networks is still incomplete , our present strategy extracts first dynamical properties of the interdependent networks . at a later time point",
    ", we can expect qualitatively advances from full dynamical simulations , however , dependent on the quality of the data sets .    on the theoretical side",
    ", future studies might shift the focus onto recasting the system into an appropriate spreading model , e.g. , in the form of an unordered binary avalanche @xcite , or as an instance of the linear threshold model @xcite with a set of links with a very high and a second set with a very low transmission probability ( c / r and d - links , respectively ) .",
    "radicchi @xcite presents an approach for the investigation of the percolation properties of finite size interdependent networks with a specific adjacency matrix with the goal of loosening some of the assumptions underlying the usual models ( e.g. , infinite system limit , graphs as instances of network model ) . while this formalism allows for the investigation of many real - world systems there are still restrictions as to the possible level of detail . in our special case ,",
    "for instance , a considerable amount of information would be lost if the system was restricted to vertices with connections in both the c / r- and d - layers .",
    "the existence of different percolation thresholds for localized perturbations in interdependent networks may reveal itself as a universal principle for balancing sensitivity and robustness in complex systems .",
    "the application of these concepts to a wide range of real - life systems is required to make progress in this direction .",

    "<S> here we study the interdependent network of gene regulation and metabolism of the model organism _ escherichia coli _ using the theoretical framework of interdependent networks .    </S>",
    "<S> in particular we aim at understanding how the biological system can consolidate the conflicting tasks of reacting rapidly to ( internal and external ) perturbations , while being robust to minor environmental fluctuations , at the same time . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we study the network response to localized perturbations and find that the interdependent network is sensitive to gene regulatory and protein - level perturbations , yet robust against metabolic changes .    </S>",
    "<S> this first quantitative application of the theory of interdependent networks to systems biology shows how studying network responses to localized perturbations can serve as a useful strategy for analyzing a wide range of other interdependent networks .    </S>",
    "<S> a main conceptual approach of current research in the life sciences is to advance from a detailed analysis of individual molecular components and processes towards a description of biological _ </S>",
    "<S> systems _ and to understand the emergence of biological function from the interdependencies on the molecular level .    supported by the diverse high - throughput omics technologies , </S>",
    "<S> the relatively recent discipline of systems biology has been the major driving force behind this new perspective which becomes manifest , for example , in the effort to compile extensive databases of biological information to be used in genome - scale models @xcite .    despite its holistic game plan </S>",
    "<S> , however , systems biology frequently operates on the level of subsystems : even when considering cell - wide transcriptional regulatory networks , as , e.g. , in a network motif analysis @xcite , this is only one of the cell s networks . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , the popular approach to studying metabolic networks in systems biology , constraint - based modeling , accounts for steady - state predictions of metabolic fluxes of genome - scale metabolic networks @xcite , which again , is only one of the other networks of the cell .    in the analysis of such large networks </S>",
    "<S> , systems biology draws its tools considerably from the science of complex networks which provides a mathematical framework especially suitable for addressing interdisciplinary questions . combining the mathematical subdiscipline of graph theory with methods from statistical physics , this new field greatly contributed to the understanding of , e.g. , </S>",
    "<S> the percolation properties of networks @xcite , potential processes of network formation @xcite or the spreading of disease on networks @xcite . in the early 2000s , gene regulation and metabolism have been among the first applications of the formalisms of network biology @xcite . among the diverse studies of network structure for these systems , the most prominent ones on the gene regulatory side are the statistical observation and functional interpretation of small over - represented subgraphs ( network motifs ) @xcite and the hierarchical organization of gene regulatory networks @xcite . on the metabolic side </S>",
    "<S> , the broad degree distribution of metabolic networks stands out @xcite , with the caveat , however , that currency metabolites ( like atp or h@xmath0o ) can severely affect network properties @xcite , as well as the hierarchical modular organization of metabolic networks @xcite .    over the last decade , the field of complex networks moved its focus from the investigation of single - network representations of systems to the interplay of networks that interact with and/or depend on each other . </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , it turned out that explicit interdependence between network constituents can fundamentally alter the percolation properties of the resulting _ interdependent networks _ , which can show a discontinuous percolation transition in contrast to the continuous behavior in single - network percolation @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the first two studies have aimed at finding consistent metabolic - regulatory steady states by translating the influence of metabolic processes on gene activity into metabolic flux predicates and incorporating high - throughput gene expression data . </S>",

    "<S> these models were first important steps towards integrating the subsystems of gene regulation and metabolism from a systems perspective .    </S>",
    "<S> the formalism of interdependent networks now allows us to go beyond these pioneering works on integrative models , by analyzing the robustness of the combined system in terms of the maximal effect a small perturbation can have on such interdependent systems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the findings can be interpreted in the context of cascading failures and percolation theory .    </S>",
