    "the need of providing a sustainable energy to the world population is becoming increasingly important .",
    "it is likely that in the following decades the efforts of the scientific community will be increasingly addressed to this direction and in particular to the heat to work transformation .",
    "an important possibility under investigation is the thermoelectric power generation and refrigeration . in spite of relevant progress made in the last years the efficiency of thermoelectric technology remains too low @xcite .",
    "indeed such efficiency depends on physical properties of a given material namely the electrical conductivity @xmath0 , the thermal conductivity @xmath1 , and the seebeck coefficient @xmath2 , and is expressed by a non - dimensional quantity , often called figure of merit , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "high efficiency requires high @xmath4 values which seem difficult to achieve . after more than 50 years from ioffe s discovery that doped semiconductors",
    "exhibit a relatively large thermoelectric effect @xcite , and in spite of recent achievements , the most efficient actual devices still operate at @xmath4 around 1 .",
    "certainly , in consideration of the importance of the problem , even a small improvement would be most welcome .",
    "however , it is generally accepted that @xmath5 is a target value for efficient competing thermoelectric technology and , so far , no clear paths exist which may lead to reach that target .",
    "in such a situation it is probably useful to investigate a different approach namely an approach which starts from first principles i.e. from the fundamental microscopic dynamical mechanisms which determine the phenomenological laws of heat and particles transport . in this connection ,",
    "as it is well known , the enormous achievements in nonlinear dynamical systems and the new tools developed have led to a much better understanding of the statistical behavior of dynamical systems .",
    "for example , the question of the derivation of the phenomenological fourier law of heat conduction from the dynamical equations of motion has been studied in great detail @xcite .",
    "theoretical work in this direction even led to the possibility to control the heat current and devise heat diodes , transistors , and thermal logic gates @xcite .",
    "preliminary experimental results have also been obtained @xcite .",
    "we are confident that this theoretical approach , combined with the present sophisticated numerical techniques , may lead to substantial progress on the way of improving the long standing problem of thermoelectric efficiency .",
    "an additional motivation in favor of this approach is that thermoelectric technology , at small sizes ( e.g. at micro or nano - scale ) , is expected to be more efficient than traditional conversion systems .",
    "indeed the efficiency of mechanical engines decrease very rapidly at low power level .",
    "the recent progress in engineering nanostructured materials opens now new possibilities .",
    "the study of dynamical complexity of these structures may lead to the design of new strategies for developing materials with high thermoelectric efficiency .",
    "nanostructures may allow to control the thermal and electrical conductivity e.g. with appropriate scattering mechanisms @xcite .    in summary",
    ", what is required is a better understanding of the fundamental dynamical mechanisms which control heat and particles transport .",
    "the combined efforts of physicists and mathematicians working in nonlinear dynamical systems and statistical mechanics , condensed matter physicists , and material scientists may prove useful to contribute substantially to the progress in this field of great importance for both energy supply and the environmental concern .",
    "the purpose of the present colloquium is to introduce the basic tools and fundamental results on steady state heat to work conversion , mainly from a rather abstract , statistical physics and dynamical system s perspective , yet with a clear focus toward potential applications .",
    "we hope our paper might help bridging the gap among rather diverse communities and research fields , such as non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , mathematical physics and dynamical systems , mesoscopic physics , and strongly correlated many - body systems of condensed matter .",
    "our line of presentation is going from more abstract to more phenomenological .",
    "we start with a short overview of non - equilibrium thermodynamics in section [ sec : nonequilibrium ] , where fundamental results on linear response theory and onsager reciprocity relations are discussed . in section",
    "[ sec : te ] we then explain basic abstract definitions of thermoelectric heat to work conversion efficiency . in section [ sec : landauer ] we review the microscopic landauer - bttiker framework for non - interacting systems and discuss the main non - interacting concepts for controlling thermodynamic efficiency : energy filtering , external noise and probe reservoirs .",
    "we believe that most of exciting future investigations on heat to work conversion will be devoted to strongly interacting systems , therefore we set the stage in section [ sec : interacting ] by reviewing state of the art on understanding thermalization in equilibrium and local - thermalization near - equilibrium in closed and open interacting systems .",
    "as the analysis of strongly interacting systems is mainly relying on numerical simulations , we outline in section [ sec : numerics ] some of the key ideas and methods for efficient simulation of non - equilibrium steady states of classical and quantum open many - body systems . in section",
    "[ sec : machines ] we then discuss some simple models of thermoelectric engines and stress their importance from either exact - solvability or practical - relevance perspective . in section [ sec : phenomenology ] we outline some phenomenological and empirical laws governing thermoelectric phenomena , with the emphasis on open theoretical problems .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] with some remarks on future prospects of the field .",
    "non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite describes processes on the basis of two types of parameters : _ thermodynamic forces _ @xmath6 ( also known as generalized forces or affinities ) driving irreversible processes , and the _ fluxes _ @xmath7 characterizing the response of the system to the applied forces . more specifically , we will consider a generic setup for the extraction of work from a heat flow .",
    "the system performs work @xmath8 against an external force @xmath9 , with thermodynamically conjugate variable @xmath10 .",
    "the force can be of mechanical , chemical , or electrical nature .",
    "the thermodynamic force is @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being the temperature of the system .",
    "the thermodynamic flux is @xmath13 , where the dot denotes the time derivative .",
    "the output power reads @xmath14 .",
    "we are considering heat to work conversion , that is , the work is performed by converting a part of the amount of heat @xmath15 flowing from the hot reservoir at temperature @xmath16 ( we assume @xmath17 ) .",
    "the thermodynamic force is @xmath18 , and the _ heat current _ reads @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , in thermoelectric power generation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the electron charge and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) the voltage difference between the two reservoirs at electrochemical potentials @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath10 is the total charge transferred from reservoir 1 to reservoir 2 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the steady - state _",
    "electric current_. we can also write @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the particle current .      assuming that the generalized forces are small , the relationship between fluxes and forces is linear : @xmath30 these relations are referred to as phenomenological ( coupled ) transport equations or _ linear response _ equations or kinetic equations and the coefficients @xmath31 are known as _",
    "onsager coefficients_. since we are assuming small thermodynamic forces , the temperature difference @xmath32 is small compared to @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 .",
    "perhaps we should also stress that we focus on the stationary and steady state situations , where all the forces and responsive currents are independent of time , on average , apart from fluctuations .",
    "the positivity of the entropy production rate , @xmath35 implies for the onsager coefficients that @xmath36    assuming the property of time - reversal invariance of the equations of motion , @xcite derived fundamental relations , known as _ onsager reciprocal relations _ for the cross coefficients of the onsager matrix : @xmath37 . when an external magnetic field @xmath38 is applied to the system ,",
    "the laws of physics remain unchanged if time @xmath39 is replaced by @xmath40 , provided that simultaneously the magnetic field @xmath38 is replaced by @xmath41 . in this case",
    "the onsager - casimir relations @xcite read @xmath42 at zero magnetic field , we recover the onsager reciprocal relations @xmath37 .",
    "note that only the diagonal coefficients are bound to be even functions of the magnetic field : @xmath43 , while in general , for @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the onsager coefficients are related to the familiar transport coefficients . in the case of thermoelectricity",
    "we have @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the ( isothermal ) _ electric conductance _ , @xmath50 the _ thermal conductance _ , @xmath2 the _ thermopower _ ( or seebeck coefficient ) , and @xmath51 denotes the onsager matrix with matrix elements @xmath31 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the peltier coefficient @xmath53 is related to the thermopower via the onsager reciprocal relation : @xmath54 .",
    "note that the onsager - casimir relations imply @xmath55 and @xmath56 , but in general do not impose the symmetry of the seebeck coefficient under the exchange @xmath57 .",
    "we can eliminate in the phenomenological equations ( [ eq : coupledlinear ] ) the onsager matrix elements in favor of the transport coefficients @xmath58 , thus obtaining @xmath59 by eliminating @xmath60 from these two equations we obtain an interesting interpretation of the peltier coefficient .",
    "indeed , the entropy current reads @xmath61 hence , @xmath62 can be understood as the entropy transported by the electron flow @xmath27 . since @xmath28 , each electron carries an entropy of @xmath63 .",
    "this contribution to the entropy current adds to the last term in ( [ eq : entropycurrent ] ) , which is independent of the electric current . for time - reversal symmetric systems",
    ", the same interpretation applies to the seebeck coefficient , since in this case @xmath64 .",
    "the heat flow @xmath65 is the sum of two terms , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . while the last term is irreversible , the first one is reversible , that is , it changes sign when reversing the direction of the current .",
    "it can be intuitively understood that efficient energy conversion requires to minimize irreversible , dissipative processes with respect to reversible processes .",
    "hence , it is desirable to have a large peltier coefficient and a small heat conductance .    the heat dissipation rate @xmath68 can be computed from the entropy production rate ( [ eq : sprod ] ) : @xmath69 where the first term is the joule heating , the second term is the heat lost by thermal resistance and the last term , which disappears for time - reversal symmetric systems , can be negative when @xmath70 , thus reducing the dissipated heat .",
    "it is clear from ( [ eq : qprod ] ) that to minimize dissipative effects for a given electric current and thermal gradient , we need a large electric conductance and low thermal conductance .    under the assumption of _ local equilibrium _ ,",
    "we can write coupled equations like ( [ eq : coupledlinear ] ) , connecting local fluxes to local forces , expressed in terms of gradients @xmath71 , @xmath72 rather than @xmath73 , @xmath74 ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in this case , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : el_conductance ] ) and ( [ eq : th_conductance ] ) can be written with on the left - hand side the _ electric conductivity _ @xmath0 and the _ thermal conductivity _ @xmath1 rather than the conductances @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "a cornerstone result goes back to @xcite . in a cycle between two reservoirs at temperatures @xmath16 and @xmath75 @xmath76 , the efficiency @xmath77 , defined as the ratio of the performed work @xmath78 over the heat @xmath15 extracted from the high temperature reservoir , is bounded by the _ carnot efficiency _",
    "@xmath79 : @xmath80 the carnot efficiency is obtained for a quasi - static transformation which requires infinite time and therefore the extracted power , in this limit , reduces to zero .",
    "an important question is how much the efficiency deteriorates when the cycle is operated in a finite time .",
    "this is the central question in the field of _ finite - time thermodynamics _",
    "( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , _ endoreversible thermodynamics _ @xcite views a thermodynamic system as a collection of reversible subsystems which interact in an irreversible manner .",
    "a very important concept is that of _ efficiency at maximum power_. an upper bound for the output power @xmath78 of a heat engine can be deduced for the endoreversible curzon - ahlborn ( ca ) engine depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : curzon ] .",
    "the ca engine consists of two heat baths at temperatures @xmath16 and @xmath75 and a reversible carnot engine operating between internal temperatures @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the two processes of heat transfer , from the hot reservoir to the system and from the system to the cold reservoir , are the only irreversible processes in the ca engine .",
    "the output work @xmath78 is the difference between the heat @xmath15 absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat @xmath84 ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) evacuated to the cold reservoir ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "heat transfers take place during the isothermal strokes of the carnot cycle , with the working fluid ( the system ) at internal temperatures @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we further assume that the rate of heat flow @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) is proportional to the temperature difference @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) between the hot ( cold ) reservoir and the working fluid , the proportionality factor being the heat conductance @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "therefore , we need a time @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) to transfer an amount @xmath15 ( @xmath96 ) of heat , so that @xmath97 @xmath98 finally , we assume that the time spent in the adiabatic strokes of the carnot cycle is negligible compared to the times of the isothermal strokes , so that the total time of cycle is approximately given by @xmath99 . such assumption is justified if the relaxation time for the working fluid is fast enough to allow to operate quickly the adiabatic trasformations .",
    "the output power reads @xmath100 taking into account that the internal carnot engine operating between temperatures @xmath81 and @xmath82 has efficiency @xmath101 and using the relations @xmath102 and @xmath103 $ ] , @xmath104 , we can express the power as @xmath105 where we have defined @xmath106 and @xmath107 . by maximizing the power with respect to the internal temperatures",
    "@xmath81 and @xmath82 we obtain @xmath108 the efficiency at the maximum power @xmath109 , commonly referred to as curzon - ahlborn upper bound @xcite , is given by @xmath110 remarkably , the ca efficiency is independent of the conductances @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the curzon - ahlborn efficiency is invariant under concatenation @xcite .",
    "we consider two thermal machines working in a tandem , the first one between the hot source at temperature @xmath16 and a second heat bath at intermediate temperature @xmath111 , the second one between this latter bath and the cold source at temperature @xmath75 .",
    "the first machine absorbs heat @xmath15 , delivers work @xmath112 and evacuates heat @xmath113 , the second machine reuses heat @xmath114 and outputs work @xmath115 . if both machines function at the ca efficiency , also the overall efficiency @xmath116 is given by @xmath117 .",
    "this self - concatenation property also holds for machines working at carnot efficiency .",
    "the ca efficiency is not a universal upper bound .",
    "efficiencies at maximum power not only below , but also above @xmath118 have been reported @xcite .",
    "yet @xmath118 describes the efficiency of actual thermal plants reasonably well @xcite , and therefore the range of validity of @xmath118 as upper bound for the efficiency at maximum power has been widely discussed in several papers @xcite ; for a recent review , see @xcite .",
    "the ca bound ( [ eq : ca.eff ] ) is an exact and universal bound only for systems with ( i ) time - reversal symmetry and ( ii ) within a regime of linear response ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : zt ] below ) . in the presence of left - right symmetry in the system ,",
    "the ca bound is exact up to quadratic order in the deviation from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "that is , to second order in @xmath79 , @xmath119    the ca efficiency was derived for the carnot cycle in the limit of low and symmetric dissipation by @xcite .",
    "they considered a carnot engine which operates under reversible conditions at the carnot efficiency when the cycle duration becomes infinitely long . in that limit ,",
    "the system entropy increase @xmath120 during the isothermal transformation at the hot temperature @xmath16 is equal to the system entropy decrease @xmath121 during the isothermal transformation at the cold temperature @xmath75 .",
    "hence , there is no overall entropy production and the carnot efficiency @xmath122 is achieved .",
    "@xcite consider the weak dissipation regime and assume that the system relaxation is much faster than the times @xmath94 and @xmath95 spent in the isothermal strokes , so that the overall cycle duration is to a good approximation given by @xmath123 . in the low dissipation regime",
    "the entropy production is proportional to @xmath124 and @xmath125 , so that it vanishes in the limit of infinite - time cycle where it is supposed that the carnot efficiency is recovered .",
    "therefore the amount of heat entering the system from the hot ( cold ) reservoir is , to first order in @xmath124 and @xmath125 , @xmath126 with @xmath127 and @xmath128 coefficients depending on the specific implementation .",
    "the maximum of the output power @xmath129 is obtained when @xmath130 .",
    "this leads to the efficiency at the maximum output power @xmath131 note that this result was also obtained in the context of stochastic thermodynamics by @xcite . within linear response ,",
    "the curzon - ahlborn efficiency is recovered for symmetric dissipation , @xmath132 . from ( [ eq : etas1s2 ] ) we obtain @xmath133 with the lower and upper bound reached in the limits of completely asymmetric dissipation , for @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "the lower and upper bound coincide in the linear response regime where @xmath136 . the same upper bound as in ( [ eq : uppermax ] ) was obtained with a different approach by @xcite .      within the linear response , the efficiency of steady state heat to work conversion reads @xmath137 where @xmath138 and the power @xmath139 .",
