    "in @xcite the author solved a question related to the sequence defined recursively by @xmath0 and for @xmath1 by :    * @xmath2    namely he showed that @xmath3 is always a prime number or 1 . at first glance",
    "this recursion is not very useful for finding primes since these differences generate primes quite randomly and the prime values are less than the number of required iterations .",
    "however , looking closer to rowland recursion we found a way to exhibit the records values in the sequence of differences @xmath3 ( these differences are given by @xmath4 in @xcite ) .",
    "namely @xmath5 when @xmath6 are exaclty those records values .",
    "so this gives a method to exhibit primes in increasing order ( and the growth is exponential ) .",
    "those @xmath5 such that @xmath6 begin :    00.00.0000       although this seems provable using rowland reasoning , it looks like it is unknown since it is not mentioned before in @xcite and this sequence of records values is not in @xcite .",
    "this is clearly a nice fact and we try to generalise this observation . in order to facilitate the computations we use the absolute value and run the algorithm `` backwards '' as we will see .",
    "so we succeeded to extend somewhat this result with the conjectures 1 and 2 and propose a method for building primes ( section 1 ) . in a conjecture 3 ( section 2 )",
    "we claim there are sequences of lesser of twin primes growing very fast .",
    "then we provide a conjecture 3bis ( cf .",
    "2.4 ) related to the polignac conjecture and a conjecture 3ter ( cf .",
    "2.5 ) dealing with the prime triplet conjecture . in a conjecture 4 ( section 3 )",
    "we propose a way to find very big primes compared to the number of iterations which could improve the conjecture 2 and be an efficient tool for searching primes . in a conjecture 5 ( section 4 )",
    "we propose a first constructive way to prove the goldbach conjecture but with some restiction due to an exceptional set of non working cases . in a conjecture 6 ( section 5 )",
    "we propose to summarize all our observations with a reformulation of the schinzel s hypothesis h. the conjecture 7 ( cf . 5.2 ) gives another approach of the conjecture 6 .",
    "we also discuss the shevelev conjecture who extends rowland idea for twin primes .",
    "indeed , v. shevelev @xcite introduced the related sequence ( @xmath7 in @xcite ) :    * @xmath8 * @xmath9    and noticed that the records values of differences ( @xmath10 in @xcite ) :    00.00.0000       gives for terms @xmath11 the greater prime of some twin primes pairs . as for rowland sequence",
    "it can be seen that the indices where these records occur is given by the sequence of @xmath5 such that @xmath12 ( except for @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 is then a twin pair of primes .",
    "using this algorithm backwards the conjecture 8 ( section 6 ) propose a sligthly different way than the conjecture 3 or 6 or shevelev conjectures to prove the weak twin prime conjecture .",
    "although shevelev managed to do it , it is not easy to generalise this observation using the `` forward '' original rowland recursion since we need to find where the records occur . however using the absolute value we shall see it is easy to obtain many increasing sequences of twin primes or of triplet of primes since we just have to check indices where zeros occur .",
    "thus in a conjecture 9 ( section 7 ) we propose a method for generating primes @xmath15-uplet of any type using periodic sequences in the gcd algorithm .",
    "then we extend the idea to a family of polynomials giving another version of the schinzel s hypothesis h. this allows us to perform easier computations than using the conjecture 6 for searching @xmath15-uplet .",
    "we finally merge our `` backward '' recursion and shevelev idea for approaching the goldbach conjecture in the conjecture 10 ( section 8) in a nicer way than the conjecture 5 .",
    "there is apparently no more exception for @xmath16 large enough .",
    "this right way to deal with this old conjecture using gcd - recursion was very hard to find .",
    "we also discuss a less known but hard conjecture of legendre ( section 9 ) .",
    "there is a curious fact in this study .",
    "it appears our methods work often better for large integer since once we found a good starting value we generate only primes , despite the probability to pick up big primes among large integers goes to zero .",
    "after some attempts we arrive to this recursion seeming generating primes in a general way starting always with the same initial value @xmath17 . for a given integer value @xmath18",
    "we define the sequence @xmath19 by @xmath20 and for @xmath1 by the recursion :    * @xmath21 .",
    "now let us consider the values of @xmath16 such that we get :    * @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "we claim that @xmath24 this sequence of indices @xmath16 gives rise to an infinite sequence @xmath25 .      for @xmath26",
    "the sequence@xmath19 begins :    00.00.0000       and the sequence @xmath27 of indices where zeros appear in @xmath19 begins :    00.00.0000       @xmath28these listed numbers are prime numbers .",
    "this led us to a first conjecture .",
    "we claim :    * @xmath29 is prime for @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath32 with @xmath33    see the appendix 1 for a table supporting this conjecture .",
    "although this conjecture is similar to the record sequence mentioned in the introduction , it is more interesting to us .",
    "indeed we were able to generalise the result and much more seems true .",
    "so we make a stronger conjecture .      in general we claim that for any @xmath18 :    * @xmath34 is prime for @xmath35 large enough ( usually @xmath36 is working for small @xmath15 ) . *",
    "@xmath28@xmath37 @xmath32 with @xmath38 .",
    "for @xmath39 the sequence @xmath19 begins :    00.00.0000       and the sequence @xmath40 begins :    00.00.0000       next the values @xmath41 appear to be prime values for @xmath36 :    00.00.0000       and @xmath42 @xmath43 with @xmath44    for @xmath45 the sequence @xmath19 begins :    00.00.0000       and the sequence @xmath46 begins :    00.00.0000       next the values @xmath47 appear to be prime values only for @xmath30 :    00.00.0000       and @xmath48 @xmath43 with @xmath49      note we find sometime primes greater than @xmath16 after making @xmath16 iterations .",
    "so it could be an efficient method for finding primes since the gcd algorithm is well known and `` fast '' computation can be performed .",
    "for instance if @xmath50 we compute @xmath51 terms of the sequence @xmath19 . in this range @xmath52 vanishes @xmath53 times .",
    "this allows us to compute @xmath54 wich gives @xmath53 values of @xmath55 :    00.00.0000       all these values are primes and the last one @xmath56 gives a prime number larger than the @xmath51 iterations ( see appendix 2 for more exemples ) .",
    "moreover it appears this kind of algorithm can be adapted for finding bigger primes as shown thereafter .",
    "observe from our definition we have for @xmath1 ( letting @xmath57 ):    * @xmath58    hence we have an `` almost '' recurrence relation between two consecutive records values which are conjectured to be prime for @xmath16 large enough .",
    "this formula explains also why these record values are growing like @xmath59 since it appears we usually do nt need to compute all terms in the sum .",
    "indeed experiments show that @xmath60 for @xmath61 and this @xmath62 depends on @xmath63 and stays `` near '' from this value .",
    "i.e. we claim that @xmath64 and is often much more smaller .",
    "so we can launch a computation and when the computer returns @xmath60 sufficiently `` often '' we may stop the computation and suspect we are beyond this @xmath62 .",
    "therefore we built perhaps a prime greater than a starting prime .",
    "it could then be interesting to know rules in order to choose `` good '' values of @xmath15 making @xmath62 the closest of @xmath63 as possible .",
    "for instance consider @xmath65 and the sequence of @xmath66 when @xmath67 wich yields somewhere for @xmath66 :    * @xmath68    the positive terms are our record values @xmath69 and are primes values . here",
    "the computation returns nothing more using @xmath70 iterations .",
    "hence we are perhaps beyond our @xmath62 and the next record would be given by @xmath71 which is a prime number and , as expected , our next record value .",
    "so we have found a prime number 11 times greater than the given prime @xmath72 with few iterations .",
    "but let us see this with a more striking exemple and take @xmath73 .",
    "we compute @xmath67 for @xmath74 wich yields for these @xmath66 :    * @xmath75    so we suspect we have nothing more after @xmath76 until the next record value",
    ". thus @xmath77 should be the next record and it is indeed a prime value .",
    "so with few effort we found a prime number @xmath78 times greater than another one .",
    "a simple routine under pari - gp found easily big primes with this method ( see the end of the appendix 2 ) .",
    "we also observe something which could have practical use for searching primes if people work together like for the gimps where they share computer power .",
    "we keep previous notations and our definition of @xmath79 ( depending on @xmath15 ) so that the first record is simply @xmath80 .",
    "then we tried to estimate the chance to got a prime value with the second record value for various @xmath15 after making @xmath81 iterations and where @xmath82 .",
    "i.e. for a given @xmath15 we define :    * @xmath83 if the second record value which equals @xmath84 is a prime value and otherwise @xmath85 . * @xmath86    then we conjecture that :    * @xmath87 exists with simply @xmath88 and so we know the probability to got a prime with this method .    to see this last point with experiments suppose @xmath89 is a set of @xmath90 random values @xmath15 satisfying @xmath91 .",
    "we take @xmath92 so that we have to make around @xmath93 iterations only to got the value @xmath84 .",
    "we then launch the computation 3 times ( so that e changes each time ) and we plot the different graph of @xmath94 ( graphs are black , blue and green ) where @xmath95 compared to the graph of @xmath96 ( red ) .",
    "( fig.1 )        this supports the claim @xmath88 . in other word",
    "this means that if we take @xmath97 random values of @xmath15 we are fairly certain the formula @xmath84 will produce at least a prime number among them .",
    "note we may start form the second record value ( or the third ... ) instead of the first but we aim to work with big values of @xmath15 so it seems inappropriate to compute the second record .",
    "although this method for finding primes seems satisfying it is not evident to see whether it is very efficient since we need to combine two computations ( one for finding the candidates and one for testing primalty ) and so far we find no rule in order to force @xmath62 to stay very close from @xmath98 perhaps the conjecture 4 would be better for that purpose ( see 3.4 . ) . by the way this kind of algorithms is interesting in its own since variations of the rowland - shevelev algorithm led us to formulate in a new way old conjectures from the additive theory of numbers .",
    "hereafter we come across conjectures like the polignac conjecture , the schintzel hypothesis h or the goldbach conjecture and our approach suggests analytic or probabilistic study .",
    "this was somewhat surprising to find such a sequence since it is not known whether there are infinitely many twin primes .",
    "here we consider the recursion @xmath20 and for @xmath1 :"
