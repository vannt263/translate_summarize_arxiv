    "recurrent novae ( rne , for abbreviation hereafter ) are distinguished from the classical novae ( cne , hereafter ) according to multiple outburst records or single one , respectively .",
    "however , all of the cne are thought to have much longer recurrence because of their cataclysmic binary properties . by the end of 2011",
    ", total definite number of rne detected is 10 ( for known rne , e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "rne are categorized into three distinct subtypes ( warner 1995 , 2008 ) , namely t crb , u sco and t pyx subtype .",
    "the criterion of the classification is mainly based on the binary orbital period , decline rate ( speed class ) and type of the secondary star . among them",
    "t pyx subtype has long a single member , i.e. , t pyxidis itself .",
    "the t pyx subtype are characterized by very short orbital period , and comparatively slow decline .",
    "the recurrent nova t pyx was first detected in 1902 by h. leavitt ( @xcite ) and had then experienced three outbursts ( before leavitt , one outburst had been recorded in 1890 ; @xcite ) .",
    "next following outbursts were 1920 , 1944 and 1966 . based on these historical records , its recurrence had been thought to be approximately 20 years .",
    "nevertheless , we could not have detected any outburst since 1966 ( see vsolj and aavso database ) .",
    "the above mentioned five outbursts show identical light curves , each with a peak visual magnitude of 6.4 and a @xmath4 days , @xmath5 days ( @xcite ) , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the amount of time taken for the brightness to decline by 2 and 3 mag from maximum , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "although three outbursts had been observed after discovery , rather fragmental spectrum was obtained . among them , @xcite had obtained pre - maximum phase spectra for two nights during 1966 outburst .",
    "the orbital period was determined by @xcite to be 1.83 hours based on their time - resolved optical spectroscopic observations at quiescence .",
    "they derived its inclination of the binary system to be @xmath8 and its white dwarf ( wd ) mass @xmath9 which is lower than the reasonable value for the case of rne .    as is mentioned above , the predicted outburst of t pyx by the end of 1980th based on the calculated recurrence ( about 20 years ) was not detected by any observers in the world ( or missing , but not plausible ) . after 45-year absence from outburst ,",
    "the sixth outburst was detected by m. linnolt ( usa ) at a visual magnitude of 13.0 on 2011 april 14.2931 ut ( @xcite ) .",
    "the early stage light curve of the 2011 outburst was obtained by solar mass ejection imager ( smei ) observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite derived an extinction ( @xmath10 ) from high resolution spectroscopy during 2011 outburst ( total night of their observation was 7 , among which 4 nights are at pre - maximum stage ) . @xcite",
    "performed near - ir photometric and spectroscopic observations on 2.37 day to 48.2 day after the outburst .",
    "they suggested an existence of face - on bipolar ejection from their analysis .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to present the detailed optical spectroscopic observational report of t pyx during the early stage ( pre - maximum to shortly after maximum ) of its eruption .",
    "this report will give the comprehension of this rn s evolutional feature at its pre - maximum stage .",
    "in addition it is important to examine whether any spectral deference exists between the present outburst and past ones due to longer ( 45-year ) quiescence . in section 2",
    ", we present our spectroscopic observations .",
    "section 3 gives the obtained results .",
    "section 4 is for the discussions .",
    "summary is stated in section 5 .",
    "we have performed low - resolution spectroscopic observations from 2011 april 16 to may 14 at the tanabe personal observatory ( tpo ) located at the northern part of okayama - city .",
    "the total number of observation is 11 nights . among them , 9 nights are at pre - maximum stage . at the final stage of our observation ,",
    "the angular distance between t pyx and the sun became so small that most of our observations were performed in the evening twilight .",
    "table 1 is a journal of the spectroscopic observations .",
    "our spectroscopic observational system is a combination of dss-7 ( sbig production ) spectrometer and st-402 ( sbig ) ccd ( kodak kaf-0402me : @xmath11 pixels ) camera installed on celestron 28 cm ( f/10 ) schmidt - cassegrain telescope .",
    "the spectrometer s resolution @xmath12 is approximately 400 at 6000  , and its dispersion is 5.4 @xmath13pixel .",
    "hence the precision of the radial velocity is @xmath14 km @xmath3 .",

    "the balmer lines show clear p cygni profile .",
    "maximum expansion velocity derived from this profile is approximately 2200 km s@xmath3 .",
    "helium and nitrogen lines are weakened day by day . according to the classification by @xcite , such novae with these terms",
    "are to be classified as a he / n type .",
    "on @xmath22 days , however , fe ii ( multiplets ; 27 , 28 , 37 , 38 , 42 , 48 , 49 and 74 ) lines emerge on the spectra which can be seen in the lower panel ( b ) of figure 1 .",
    "fe ii lines are strengthened day by day , and the p cygni profiles also become more prominent than before . according to the classification by @xcite , such novae with these terms",
    "are to be classified as a fe ii type .",
    "it is remarkable that the spectral type of t pyx during the pre - maximum stage evolves from he",
    "/ n type to fe ii type .",
    "figure 2 is an enlarged spectra of h@xmath2 , showing the temporal behavior of its p cygni profile .",

    ", h@xmath2 shows clear p cygni profile .",
    "however , this profile is temporarily diminished at earlier fe ii phase ( @xmath23 to @xmath24 days ) .",
    "subsequently , it become clear again at later fe ii phase ( after @xmath25 days ) . in addition",
    ", the intensity of absorption component is stronger at later fe ii phase than he / n one .",
    "these behavior may be explained by the increase of the optical thickness .",
    "upper panel of figure 3 shows multi - color light curves ( @xmath26 ) collected by vsolj .",
    "temporal variations of the expansion velocity due to p cygni profile ( h@xmath2 , @xmath27 , o i and fe ii ) are shown in the lower panel .",
    "on @xmath19 days , the blueshifted absorption minima of these lines show the expansion velocities of approximately 1600 km s@xmath3 ( o i ) , 1900 km s@xmath3 ( h@xmath27 ) and 2200 km s@xmath3 ( h@xmath2 ) .",
    "it is also notable that after rapid decrease the expansion velocity shows gradual increase .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure2.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)figure3.eps      according to @xcite , those novae that show stronger lines of he and n have larger expansion velocities and higher level of ionization . on the other hand , novae with prominent fe ii lines have slower expansion velocities and lower level of ionization , accompanying p cygni absorption components . hence the spectral type of t pyx during the pre - maximum stage is thought to evolve from he / n type to fe ii type .",
    "the pre - maximum spectra have generally been explained by a uniformly expanding optically thick envelope , cooling as it expand ( warner 1995 , 2008 ) .",
    "however , such a picture is difficult for explaining the behavior of t pyx at its pre - maximum spectral evolution . in this case",
    ", the following sequential process is thought to be occurred :    1 .   at the earlier pre - maximum stage , an optically thin region",
    "is formed as a result of rapid expansion by nova eruption , resulting in he / n type spectrum .",
    "2 .   at the later stage an optically thick region",
    "is formed due to suppression effect by growing photosphere , resulting in fe ii type spectrum .    in accordance with these two steps , the expansion velocity changes from decreasing to increasing mode ( see lower panel of fig .",
    "@xcite had obtained spectra of t pyx 1966 outburst on 23 and 20 days before maximum light ( unfortunately only two nights ) .",
    "the emission lines of balmer series , he i , n ii , o ii , mg ii were seen on @xmath28 days .",
    "he reported that n ii line became weaken and fe ii lines emerged on @xmath29 days . from our results ,",
    "n ii lines can be seen on @xmath30 to @xmath20 days , and then fe ii lines can be seen from @xmath22 days . the spectral evolution of t pyx in 2011 outburst seems to be consistent with 1966 outburst .",
    "so far , the only known nova showing the pre - maximum spectral type evolution from he / n to fe ii type is a classical nova ( cn ) v5558 sgr ( @xcite ) .",
    "however this cn shows much slower ( @xmath31 km s@xmath3 ) and monotonously increasing expansion velocity . concerning the velocity variation at pre - maximum stage ,",
    "cn v723 cas is similar to t pyx . as is reported by @xcite this cn s velocity behavior at pre - maximum stage",
    "is from decreasing phase to increasing one .",
    "however this cn seems to show no spectral evolution during the pre - maximum stage .",
    "the spectral type of t pyx during the pre - maximum stage is thought to evolve from he / n type to fe ii one .",
    "the velocity from blueshifted absorption component is at first in decreasing mode , then turns to be increasing mode .",
    "spectral evolution of t pyx 2011 outburst during pre - maximum stage is thought to be compatible with 1966 outburst .",
    "the spectral evolution from he / n type to fe ii type during the pre - maximum stage is similar to v5558 sgr , but temporal change of expansion velocity is similar to v723 cas rather than v5558 sgr ."
