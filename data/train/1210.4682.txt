    "while in equilibrium systems the correct weighting of fluctuations has disclosed the basis of modern statistical mechanics , uncovering the properties of non - equilibrium fluctuations remains one of the most challenging and far reaching open questions of statistical physics .",
    "however , in spite of recent important developments @xcite , explicit calculations , especially for interacting systems , are limited to a few cases @xcite . while for non - equilibrium stationary states a major advance has been the recognition of a general symmetry of the probability distribution of certain observables , described by the so - called fluctuation theorems @xcite , the behavior of fluctuations in slowly relaxing systems such as those undergoing critical dynamics , phase - ordering kinetics , glassy evolution , forced relaxation and others , is much less understood .",
    "traditionally these systems have been characterized in terms of the space and time dependence of two - point correlation functions and responses ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , the review articles  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been only relatively recently that interest has moved to the study of fluctuations of these quantities and , in particular , their characterization _ via _ higher order correlation and response functions  @xcite .",
    "these properties should , obviously , give us a more detailed description of the behavior of these highly non - trivial processes .",
    "a large activity around the analysis of fluctuations in glass forming liquids and other similar materials exists  @xcite .    in this paper we study analytically the distribution of fluctuations of some quantities the average of which yield the usual two - point correlation function and linear response in three unfrustrated models : the random walk , the @xmath0 dimensional scalar field and the @xmath1 xy model . in its structure this paper follows the presentation in  @xcite where aging and the usual fluctuation - dissipation ( fd ) relation were studied in these same three models with the purpose of highlighting the fact that neither disorder nor glassiness are needed to obtain non - trivial dynamic features .",
    "composite operators formed with the above - mentioned fluctuating quantities are related to higher order correlation and response functions @xcite , and ratios between such composite operators can then be defined which generalize the largely studied fd ratios .",
    "the analysis of these ratios in the asymptotic time limit inform us , in particular , on the relevance of the effective temperature notion  @xcite ( for reviews see  @xcite ) beyond the _ linear order_. these analytical studies are complemented by numerical simulations of the @xmath1 clock model with @xmath3 and @xmath4 states , where a similar behavior is found .",

    "we wish to characterize the statistics of fluctuating quantities the average of which yield the two - time correlation and linear response .",

    "[ sec : random - walk ] or the scalar field considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : scalar ] ) one is usually interested in the correlation and response of a field whose dynamics is ruled by a langevin equation of the type = - + ( x , t ) , [ langev ] @xmath5 being an effective ginzburg - landau free - energy and @xmath6 a thermal noise with the usual properties @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( we set @xmath9 and we absorbed the coefficient @xmath10 with a redefinition of time ) .",
    "this equation is complemented by the choice of an initial condition @xmath11 .    in this stochastic dynamic equation",
    "there are two sources of fluctuations : the initial condition , if taken from a probability distribution , and the random force mimicking the thermal noise . in the process of computing a response function",
    ", the applied perturbation may be an additional source of fluctuations , if it is taken to be random . in the analytical approaches contained in this paper we will choose to work with fixed initial conditions and we will therefore freeze the first source of fluctuations mentioned above .",
    "the effect of random initial conditions will be considered in sec .",
    "[ clockquench ] for a discrete model , the clock model , which can not be described in terms of a langevin equation and must be studied numerically .",
    "let us now introduce the two - time average quantities we will be interested in , the correlation and the linear response function , and their fluctuating parts .",
    "the two - time correlation function is defined as c c(x , x;t , t ) = ( x , t ) ( x,t ) , [ cfirst ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are two generic points in space and @xmath14 and @xmath15 two generic times . from this expression",
    "the definition of the fluctuating part of the correlation as c c(x , x;t , t ) = ( x , t ) ( x,t ) , [ flucc - def ] is meaningful , since taking the average of the quantity in eq .  ( [ flucc - def ] ) one immediately recognizes the ( averaged ) correlation @xmath16 . although the definition ( [ flucc - def ] ) is not unique , since other different fluctuating quantities may share the same average , for the correlation function this appears as the most _ natural _ choice .",
    "let us notice that not only the average of @xmath17 yields @xmath18 , but composite operators ( or moments ) formed with this fluctuating field provide higher order correlation functions .",
    "this observation , which may seem quite trivial for the correlation function , is not so obvious when dealing with the response function , for which the definition of a fluctuating part is less straightforward .",
    "the usual perturbation used to compute it is a field , say @xmath19 , possibly drawn from a probability distribution , that couples linearly to the variable of interest , say @xmath20 itself , in such a way that @xmath21 .",
    "the perturbed langevin equation then acquires an additional additive force . from here",
    "one can easily prove  @xcite , for any @xmath5 , that the averaged linear response function is simply related to the correlation between @xmath22 and the noise @xmath6 : @xmath23 this relation gives us two fluctuating fields , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , whose noise averages yield the linear response function , as _ natural _ candidates to define the fluctuating part .",
    "the question then arises as to which is , between these two , the most interesting quantity to consider .",
    "in fact , although these objects have the same thermal average , they may have different fluctuation spectra and higher - order correlations . in  @xcite",
    "we showed that the two - time fields appearing in the martin - siggia - rose - jenssen - dedominicis dynamic generating functional are naturally related to @xmath26 .",
    "this suggests that the quantity @xmath25 may play a special physical role and is worth of being studied .",
    "indeed , special and interesting properties are exhibited by this fluctuating quantity in the case of aging spin - glasses @xcite .",
    "similar considerations have led to use this same fluctuating quantity in ferromagnetic systems in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it must be recalled that composite operators formed with the field @xmath27 are directly related to higher order response functions @xcite , a property analogous to the one discussed above for the fluctuating part of the correlation function .",
    "this allows one to define ratios between composite operators of the fluctuating parts of response and correlation ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : composite ] ) , which are natural generalizations of the usual fd ratio and , by studying their behavior , to discuss the relevance of the notion of an effective temperature beyond linear order . finally , restricting to the quadratic models considered analytically in this paper ,",

    "instead , @xmath31 fluctuates and its higher order moments are non - trivial , as we will show in the following .    in conclusion , we define the fluctuating part of the linear response as rr(x , x;t , t ) = ( x , t ) , [ flucr - def ] which , together with eq .",

    "therefore ratios between composite operators with the same @xmath143 converge to a finite value in the large time limit for any value of @xmath143 .",
    "since such composite operators are strictly related to higher order correlation and response functions , these ratios can be regarded as a generalization of the usual fd ratio above linear order . in the restricted context of the simple models considered analytically in this article",

    "this indicates that the growing length enters different composite operators in the same scaling way .",
    "the different scaling functions found in the quenched clock model , where two different lengths are present , seems to indicate that different composite operators are sensitive to different lengths .    some previous studies of the second - order momenta in different model systems had been performed and we wish now to confront our findings to these . in so doing , we will refine the picture of the dynamic scaling of fluctuations in i ) coarsening systems quenched below their critical temperature ; ii ) disordered spin models such as the edwards - anderson spin - glass ; iii ) critical systems as the ones we studied here .",

    "<S> we study analytically the distribution of fluctuations of the quantities whose average yield the usual two - point correlation and linear response functions in three unfrustrated models : the random walk , the @xmath0 dimensional scalar field and the @xmath1 xy model . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we consider the time dependence of ratios between composite operators formed with these fluctuating quantities which generalize the largely studied fluctuation - dissipation ratio , allowing us to discuss the relevance of the effective temperature notion beyond linear order . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of fluctuations in the aforementioned solvable cases is compared to numerical simulations of the @xmath1 clock model with @xmath2 states . </S>"
