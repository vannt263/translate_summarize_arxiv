    "one of the most important problems in modern cosmology is to address the dark energy issue , which is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the observed universe . over the last few decades",
    ", several studies have been focused on trying to tackled this problem .",
    "it is well known that this form of energy is acting as a repulsive gravitational force so that in general relativity ( gr ) one needs to consider a further non - standard fluid with a negative pressure to justify this accelerated scenario .",
    "the simplest approach is to consider a cosmological constant in order to explain it .",
    "however from quantum considerations , the necessary expected value of it must be extremely larger than the observed value @xcite .",
    "another approach to the cosmic accelerated behavior comes from modified theories of gravities where , instead of searching for new material ingredients , the philosophy is to address cosmic dynamics taking into account possible further degrees of freedom of the gravitational field .",
    "a very well - studied approach to modified gravity comes out from the  teleparallel equivalent to general relativity \" ( tegr ) .",
    "this theory yields the same field equations as in general relavity , so that tegr is an alternative and equivalent theory to it .",
    "however , the geometrical interpretation of these theories are different . on the one hand",
    ", gr assumes a non - zero curvature and a vanishing torsion by choosing the symmetric levi - civita connection . on the other hand",
    ", tegr considers an antisymmetric connection provided with a non - vanishing torsion and a zero curvature ( weitzenbck connection ) . in other words",
    ", one can say that gr uses the curvature to geometrize the space - time , meanwhile tegr uses torsion to explain gravitational effects . in tegr , we need to use tetrad fields as the dynamical variables in order to define the weitzenbck connection ( see @xcite , and also the review @xcite for the basis in tegr ) .",
    "a natural generalization of tegr is , instead of using the scalar torsion @xmath2 , to consider an arbitrary and smooth function of the torsion @xmath0 in the gravitational action @xcite .",
    "this theory is the so - called  @xmath0 gravity \" .",
    "the idea comes out naturally exactly as when gr is generalized to @xmath1 gravity @xcite .",
    "an important problem related to @xmath0 gravity is that it is no longer invariant under local lorentz transformations so that different tetrads might give rise to different solutions .",
    "therefore one needs to be very careful choosing the correct tetrad @xcite .",
    "although tegr is equivalent to gr , it is important to mention that @xmath1 is no longer equivalent to @xmath0 gravity @xcite .",
    "one needs to consider a more general theory of gravity , the so - called  @xmath3 gravity \" to obtain the teleparallel equivalent to @xmath1 gravity @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is important to remark that @xmath0 gravity contains only second order derivative terms meanwhile @xmath1 gravity contains up to fourth order derivative terms in the metric formalism .    in the last few years",
    ", @xmath0 gravity acquired a lot of interest in cosmology due to the possibility to explain by it the accelerated expansion of the cosmic hubble fluid ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , astrophysical studies related with compact objects as black holes has been considered among @xmath0 gravity such as in @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth noticing that this is not the only solution that can be achieved by the noether symmetry approach .",
    "as shown in @xcite for @xmath1 gravity , the symmetries select the form of the function and several noether vectors can exist . in the specific case of @xmath0 gravity , other solutions have been found as discussed in @xcite .",
    "a very studied process , known as accretion , occurs when a fluid is situated in the vicinity of a black hole or a massive astrophysical object ( see @xcite ) . in this process",
    ", the compact object takes particles from the fluid and increases its mass .",
    "accretion takes place regularly in the universe , and it can be used to test gravitational theories using observational measurements @xcite . the first study on accretion",
    "was performed using newtonian gravity by bondi @xcite .",
    "he found transonic solutions for a gas accreting onto compact objects .",
    "michel extended the later work considering gr for a schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "an important work in this field has been pursued by babichev et .",
    "al , where they showed that the mass of the black hole decreases when a phantom fluid is in accretion onto it @xcite .",
    "later , m.  jamil and a.  qadir showed that primordial black holes decay earlier when the effect of accretion of phantom energy is considered @xcite .",
    "in addition , b.  nayak and m.  jamil also found that primordial black holes accrete radiation , matter and vacuum energy when they pass through radiation , matter and vacuum dominated eras , respectively , with the result that they live longer during the ration era @xcite .",
    "after that , several works have been done on accretion onto compact objects ( see @xcite ) .    recently , a. k. ahmed and collaborators studied accretion for cyclic and heteroclinic flows near @xmath1 black holes @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will use a similar formalism in order to study the accretion process in a black hole in the context of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly introduce the tegr and @xmath0 gravity . in section iii , we discuss the metric representation of black holes in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "section iv is devoted to find the general equations for spherical accretion . in section",
    "v , we perform a dynamical system analysis using the hamiltonian formalism and we study the system at the critical points ( cps ) . in section",
    "vi , we obtain solutions for isothermal test fluids for different kind of fluids . in section vii",
    ", we analyze the accretion process for a polytropic test fluid .",
    "finally , in section viii , we discuss our results and draw conclusions . throughout the paper",
    "we will use the metric signature @xmath4 and the geometric units @xmath5 .",
    "let us briefly introduce tegr and its generalization which is the so called @xmath0 gravity .",
    "we will adopt the notation used in @xcite .",
    "in this theory , the dynamical variable is the tetrad field @xmath6 ( or vierbein ) , where latin and greek index indicate tangents space and space - time index respectively .",
    "the construction of this theory lies on the relationship between the tetrad field and the metric @xmath7 in the following way @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the inverse of the metric , @xmath10 is the inverse tetrad which satisfies the relation @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the minkowski metric . therefore , at each point @xmath13 of the manifold , the tetrad field form an orthonormal basis for the tangent space .",
    "+ as we discussed before , tegr uses a specific connection ( weitzenbck connection ) where the space - time is globally flat but it is endowed with a nonzero torsion tensor .",
    "this connection is defined by @xmath14 then , we can construct the torsion tensor using the antisymmetric part of the weitzenbck connection as follows @xmath15 using the torsion tensor , one can define the contorsion tensor @xmath16 in addition , it is useful to define @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the contraction of the torsion tensor .",
    "+ using the above tensor , the torsion scalar @xmath2 can be defined as @xmath19 the riemann tensor can be expressed depending on the contorsion tensor as follows @xmath20 here @xmath21 represents the covariant metric derivative .",
    "therefore , the ricci scalar @xmath22 and the torsion scalar @xmath2 are related by @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "it is important to remark that @xmath25 is a boundary term .",
    "+ instead of using the ricci scalar @xmath22 as in gr , the tegr lagrangian density is described by the torsion scalar @xmath2 @xmath26 since @xmath27 is a boundary term , from , one can see that the tegr action will arise to the same field equations as the einstein - hilbert action , making these two theories equivalent .",
    "+ one important and very well - studied generalization of tegr is to consider an arbitrary smooth function of the scalar torsion to construct the action @xmath28 this theory is called  @xmath0 gravity \" and it has numerous and interesting applications , for example in cosmology ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review of those models ) .",
    "one important feature of this theory is that meanwhile tegr is an equivalent theory to gr , @xmath0 does not produce the same field equations as @xmath1 gravity ( due to the relationship ) and therefore one needs to consider a generalisation of from @xmath29 to find the teleparallel equivalent to @xmath1 gravity as discussed in @xcite . starting from the action , the field equations read @xmath30s_{\\nu}{}^{\\mu\\lambda}+    4e^{a}_{\\nu}\\partial_{\\mu}(e s_{a}{}^{\\mu\\lambda})f_{t}\\nonumber\\\\",

    "the metric for a spherically symmetric black hole with mass @xmath32 in @xmath0 gravity is given by  @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 here , all @xmath35 and @xmath36 are constants .",
    "the horizon is given by @xmath37 where we have introduced the new constants @xmath38 and @xmath39 which will turn very useful in the study of the dynamical system . to ensure that @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 must have the same sign : @xmath43 . since @xmath44 must be positive at spatial infinity , we must have @xmath45 resulting in @xmath46 . upon performing the coordinate transformation",
    "@xmath47 we bring the metric   to the following form where @xmath48 @xmath49 this is precisely the general form of metric used in ref .",

    "@xcite , are thus applicable to our present investigation upon replacing @xmath51 by @xmath52 .",
    "however , because of their importance , we will outline their derivations below .",
    "let @xmath53 be the baryon number density in the fluid rest frame and @xmath54 be the four velocity of the fluid where @xmath55 is the proper time .",
    "we define the particle flux or current density by @xmath56 where @xmath53 is the particle density . from the particle conservation law",
    ", we have that the divergence of current density is conserved , i.e. @xmath57 where @xmath21 is the covariant derivative .",
    "on the other hand , energy - momentum tensor is explicitly given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the energy density and @xmath60 is the pressure .",
    "we assume that the fluid is radially flowing in the equatorial plane @xmath61 , therefore @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we set @xmath64 . using the normalization condition @xmath65 and  , we obtain , @xmath66 on the equatorial plane @xmath61 , the continuity equation  ( [ 6a ] ) yields @xmath67 or , upon integrating , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a constant of integration .",
    "the thermodynamics of simple fluids is described by  @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath2 is the temperature , @xmath71 is the specific entropy and @xmath72 is the specific enthalpy . on the other hand , a theorem of relativistic hydrodynamics  @xcite states that the scalar @xmath73 is conserved along the trajectories of the fluid , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a killing vector of spacetime .",
    "consider the timelike killing vector @xmath76 of the metric  , we obtain @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a constant of integration .",
    "it is easy to show that the specific entropy is conserved along the fluidlines : @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , if we rewrite energy - momentum tensor @xmath80   as @xmath81  @xcite , then project the conservation formula of @xmath80 onto @xmath82 , we obtain : @xmath83{\\nonumber}\\\\ \\quad = \\ & u^{\\mu}(h\\nabla_{\\mu}n-\\nabla_{\\mu}e)=-ntu^{\\mu}\\nabla_{\\mu}s=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the special case we are considering in this work where the fluid motion is radial , stationary ( no dependence on time ) , and it conserves the spherical symmetry of the black hole , the latter equation reduces to @xmath84 everywhere , that is , @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the motion of the fluid is isentropic and equations   reduce to @xmath86 equations  , , and   are the main equations that we will use to analyze the flow .",
    "since @xmath71 is constant , this reduces the canonical form of the equation of state ( eos ) of a simple fluid @xmath87 to the barotropic form @xmath88 from the second equation  , we have @xmath89 which yields @xmath90 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath53 .",

    "a common conclusion we can draw upon comparing the solutions of this section with those of the previous one is that low pressure fluids ( @xmath138 and @xmath266 small ) do not develop critical flows ( no cps ) and high pressure fluids develop critical flows but they may maintain purely subsonic , even non - relativistic , flows .    barotropic fluids with @xmath314 , if there are any , may have cps but no critical flow and their accretion velocity never vanishes as depicted in fig .",

    "[ fig6 ] . for large values of the hamiltonian ( this would be the case if @xmath285 is large , @xmath53 , or @xmath266 ) , the accretion along one of these two paths is almost non - relativistic for @xmath315 , then the velocity jumps to supersonic and relativistic values as @xmath207 approaches @xmath155 . for lower values of the hamiltonian",
    ", the accretion takes place near the cp and the polytropic fluid never reaches the horizon .    as the title of this section indicates , the analysis made in this section and in the previous ones concern accretion of _ test _ fluids neglecting all backreaction effects .",
    "this rules out any homoclinic flow and motion along closed paths , as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , where @xmath108 conserves the same sign but @xmath207 increases and decreases .",
    "in this paper , we discussed in detail the accretion process of a spherically symmetric black hole in the context of @xmath0 gravity . in order to select the form of @xmath0 model",
    ", we adopted the noether symmetry approach , following @xcite .",
    "in particular , we discussed spherically symmetric solutions coming from @xmath316 models ( and , in general , analytic @xmath0 models ) that give rise to metrics of the form and related gravitational potentials of the form , see @xcite for details .",
    "we have analyzed the motion of isothermal relativistic and ultra - relativistic fluids by means of a hamiltonian dynamical system capable of representing hydrodynamics around the black hole .",
    "the thermodynamical properties of the fluids have been discussed according to the suitable eos .",
    "furthermore conserved quantities and cps have been selected for any fluid . roughly , the accretion mechanism can be classified as subsonic and supersonic according to the features of the black hole and the eos .",
    "in particular , the 3-dimensional velocity flow strictly depends on the eos , the radius and the cps on the phase space .",
    "finally , the results have been compared to the analogue results in @xmath1 gravity putting in evidence similarities and differences .",
    "clearly , the accretion process of the fluids flowing the black holes strictly depends on the conserved quantities ( noether s symmetries ) and the structure of cps , as shown above .",
    "if conserved quantities are not identified , it could become extremely difficult to define the phase space structure of the dynamical problem and consequently the features of cps . in conclusion , identifying the noether symmetries allows to fix the model ( i.e. the form of @xmath0 ) , to derive the metric and the gravitational potentials , thanks to the reduction of the dynamical system , to define the form of the space phase .",
    "models without these features are very difficult to be handled .    from a very genuine observational point of view",
    ", these studies could be related to the possible observable features of @xmath0 black holes . in particular , the possibility to investigate @xmath0 vs @xmath1 black holes could be a powerful tool to discriminate between the curvature ( gr ) and torsional ( tegr ) formulation of theories of gravity ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) . specifically , the accretion process onto a black hole could be the feature capable of discriminating among competing models and , in general , between a curvature or a torsional formulation . a main role in this discussion",
    "is played by the stability conditions .",
    "for example , as discussed in @xcite for the case of @xmath1 gravity , the stability conditions for any self gravitating object strictly depend on the theory .",
    "there is demonstrated that the jeans stability criterion is different if one consider @xmath1 instead of gr because effective mass , stability radius , jeans wave length and the other parameters characterizing any astrophysical object slightly change according to the underlying model . in general ,",
    "if the accretor has a mass @xmath32 and a radius @xmath317 , the gravitational energy release is @xmath318 clearly the accretion yield increases with the compacteness @xmath319 , that is , given a mass @xmath32 , the yields depends on the accretor radius .",
    "considering alternative theories of gravity , the above relation can be written as @xmath320 where the features of the given model can be summarized into the effective gravitational coupling @xmath321 .",
    "this means that the effective potential ( related , for example , to the @xmath322 component of the metric ) , determines the accretion process .",
    "for example , the potential indicates that the extra terms with respect to the newtonian one contribute to any accretion process by modifying the accretion yield . as discussed in sec.vi d ,",
    "differences and similarities between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 pictures can be put in evidence by a detailed study of the accretion process . in particular , the number of cps , the state parameter @xmath138 and other features , besides the effective potential , can discriminate among competing models . from a genuine observational point of view",
    ", luminous phenomena powered by black holes could contain features capable of discriminating among theories as soon as the parameters @xmath98 , @xmath32 , and @xmath317 are combined into a gravitational potential .",
    "for example , the accretion luminosity @xmath323 is a feature directly related to these phenomena . here",
    "@xmath324 is the mass variation with time .",
    "if one consider a gamma ray burst , we have @xmath325 @xmath326 with @xmath327 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this huge amount of energy can be addressed in a strong field regime by curvature corrections . in other words ,",
    "the role of @xmath321 for the adopted underlying model , is crucial .",
    "furthermore , other characterizing parameters , besides @xmath321 , can be identified to discriminate observationally concurring accretion models : e.g. the salpeter timescale @xcite , blackbody temperature@xmath328 for thermalization , eddington limit @xcite and so on .",
