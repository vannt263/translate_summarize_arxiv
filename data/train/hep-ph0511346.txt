    "the qcd description of exclusive processes has been successfully extended to meson pair production through two - photon collisions @xmath4 , in the kinematical region of large virtuality of one photon and of small center of mass energy  @xcite .",
    "the scattering amplitude of the process can be factorized into a perturbative calculable hard process @xmath5 or @xmath6 , and non - perturbative matrix elements describing the transition of the two partons into a hadron pair , which are called generalized distribution amplitudes ( gdas )  @xcite , to emphasize their close connection with the distribution amplitudes introduced many years ago in the description of exclusive hard process  @xcite .",
    "the gdas are related by crossing  @xcite to the generalized parton distributions ( gpds )  @xcite , which enter the factorization of deeply virtual compton scattering and hard exclusive processes  @xcite , and encode information of the quark orbital angular momentum contributing to the nucleon spin  @xcite .",
    "a systematic investigation of the pions gdas ( 2@xmath7das ) has been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the corresponding phenomenology at @xmath8 colliders has been developed  @xcite in detail .",
    "gdas can also be defined for more complicated systems .",
    "the case of three pions has been studied in   @xcite , two baryon production in  @xcite ( although in a different kinematical region ) , and the case of two vector mesons ( @xmath9 mesons ) @xmath10 in  @xcite , which has been measured first by the l3 collaboration  @xcite at lep and the data has been analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "gdas appear in a variety of hard scattering processes other than the two - photon process .",
    "studies have also been performed on exotic meson production  @xcite , and exclusive heavy mesons decaying to multimesons  @xcite , where a large scale is set by the heavy quark mass . in this paper",
    "we consider another process that has not been studied so far , the pion pair production at the @xmath0-pole : @xmath11 . in this process",
    "the mass of the @xmath0 boson provides a natural hard scale .",
    "thus in the kinematical region where the invariant mass of pion pair @xmath12 is small , the process can be separated into a hard subprocess @xmath13 and a non - perturbative two - pion distribution amplitude , analogous to @xmath14 .",
    "we give a leading order calculation for neutral and charged pion pair production at the @xmath0-pole .",
    "using an available model for the 2@xmath7das we find that the cross - section for charged pion pair production is much larger than the case of neutral pion pair , which means that the process is dominated by the isovector channel , that is , the contribution from the @xmath2-odd part of the @xmath3das .",
    "the same one also contributes to the hard exclusive electroproduction of pion pairs  @xcite .",
    "our study shows that combining the measurement of charged pair and neutral pair production at the @xmath0-pole can give information of the @xmath2-odd part of the @xmath3das .",
    "the bremsstrahlung process @xmath15 is also considered in our analysis .",
    "the underlying process we study is : @xmath17 the photon emission allows for a small invariance mass to be transferred to the pion pair .",
    "denoting by @xmath18 and @xmath19 the momenta of the @xmath0 boson and final state photon , respectively , we use @xmath20 and @xmath21 to denote the momenta of the two - pion mesons , and define the sum of the two - pion momenta as @xmath22 . the lowest order diagrams of pion pair production at the @xmath0-pole are shown in fig .",

    "we choose the pion pair center of mass frame ( shown in fig .",

    "the skewness parameter @xmath30 is the momentum fraction of plus momentum carried by @xmath31 with respect to the pion pair : @xmath32    the hadronic tensor of the process is @xmath33 which is expressed as a convolution of a hard coefficient function and a soft correlation function , @xmath34 is the momentum fraction of the quark with respect to the hadronic system . @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the neutral current and electromagnetic current respectively .",

    "it is useful to recall some symmetry properties of @xmath3das .",
    "charge conjugation invariance of the strong interactions implies  @xcite : @xmath57 following the notation in  @xcite the @xmath2-even and @xmath2-odd parts ( in @xcite they are also called isoscalar and isovector parts respectively ) of @xmath3 da can be defined as @xmath58,\\label{cpm}\\ ] ] where the superscript @xmath59 represents @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",

    "these vectors have the form : @xmath75 similar to the two - photon process , in leading twist only the transverse polarization contributes , and the polarizations of the @xmath0 boson and the photon must be the same .",
    "this follows from angular momentum conservation in the collinear approximation .",
    "the pion pair production at the @xmath0-pole can be realized in the @xmath8 annihilation process @xmath76 .",
    "it is interesting to mention that except for the fact that the process occurs at the @xmath0-pole , this process is related by crossing to the virtual compton process @xmath77 , as well as the process @xmath78 .    with the polarizations of the final photon summed the amplitude of the process is calculated from @xmath79 here @xmath80 is the @xmath0-boson - lepton vertex , and @xmath81 and @xmath82 have the same form as shown in ( [ cqv ] ) , and ( [ cqa ] ) where @xmath83 for the electron is @xmath47 .",
    "the differential cross - section for the process @xmath84 is expressed as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the center of mass energy squared of the lepton pair .",

    "however , there is also contribution from a bremsstrahlung type process that @xmath100 , where a time - like photon produced in a qed process decays into the pion pair . the differential cross - section of this process in the kinematics that we consider ( @xmath101 ) has the form @xmath102 to complete the analysis",
