    "during largest solar flare , of a few minutes duration , the particle flux escaping the corona eruption and hitting later on the earth , is 3 - 4 order of magnitude above the common atmospheric cr background . if the flare particle interactions on the sun corona is taking place as efficiently as in terrestrial atmosphere , than their secondaries by charged pions and muons decays , are leading to a neutrinos fluency on earth comparable to one day terrestrial atmospheric neutrino activity ( upper bound ) .",
    "one therefore may expect a prompt increase of neutrino signals of the order of one day integral events made by atmospheric neutrinos @xcite . in present neutrino detectors",
    "the signal is just on the edge , but as long as the authors know , it has been never revealed @xcite .",
    "sun density at the flare corona might be diluted and pion production maybe consequently suppressed ( by a factor ( 0.1 - 0.05 ) ) .",
    "this may be the reason for the sk null detection . indeed the low gamma signals recently reported @xcite",
    "confirm this suppressed signal , but just at the detection edge ( see fig.[01],[02 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately the neutrino signal at hundred mev energies is rare while the one at ten mev or below is polluted by solar hep neutrinos .",
    "the expected signal is dominated by @xmath2 mev neutrinos , that might be greatly improved by anti - neutrino component via gadolinium presence in next sk detectors @xcite .",
    "our earliest ( 2006 ) upper limit estimate for october - november @xmath3 solar flares @xcite and the recent january @xmath4 2005 @xcite exceptional flare were leading to signal near unity for super - kamiokande and to a few events above unity for megaton detectors ( see fig.[01],[02 ] ) .",
    "our present estimate based on a lower ( gamma ) bound of neutrino signal , while below the upper ones , still confirms the order of magnitude and the near edge discovery ( see fig.[01],[02 ] ) .",
    "the recent peculiar solar flares as the october - november @xmath3 and january @xmath0 @xcite were source of high energetic charged particles : large fraction of these _ primary _ particles , became a source of both neutrons @xcite and _ secondary _ kaons , @xmath5 , pions , @xmath6 by their particle - particle spallation on the sun surface @xcite .",
    "consequently , @xmath7 , final secondaries muonic and electronic neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 rays , are released by the chain reactions @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 occurring on the sun atmosphere .",
    "there are two different sites for these decays ( see @xcite ) : a brief and sharp solar flare , originated within the @xmath16 corona itself and a diluted and delayed @xmath17 neutrino flux , produced by late flare particles hitting the earth s atmosphere .",
    "this latter delayed signal is of poor physical interest , like an inverse missing signal during the e. forbush phase . the main and first _",
    "solar _ flare neutrinos reach the earth with a well defined directionality and within a narrow time range .",
    "the corresponding average energies @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( since low solar corona densities ) suffer negligible energy loss : @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 , @xmath23 100 @xmath24 200 mev .",
    "the opposite occur to downward flare . in the simplest approach ,",
    "the main source of pion production is @xmath25 ; @xmath26 at the center of mass of the resonance @xmath27 ( whose mass value is @xmath28 mev ) . as a first approximation and as a useful simplification after the needed boost of the secondaries energies",
    "one may assume that the total pion @xmath29 energy is equally distributed , in average , in all its final remnants : ( @xmath9 , @xmath30 , @xmath10 , @xmath8):@xmath31 . similar nuclear reactions ( at lower probability ) may also occur by proton - alfa scattering leading to : @xmath32 ; @xmath33 . here",
    "we neglect the @xmath34 additional role due to the flavor mixing and the dominance of previous reactions @xmath35 . to a first approximation",
    "the flavor oscillation will lead to a decrease in the muon component and it will make the electron neutrino component a bit harder",
    ". indeed the oscillation length ( at the energy considered ) is small with respect to the earth - sun distance : @xmath36 . while at the birth place the neutrino fluxes by positive charged pions @xmath37 are @xmath38:@xmath39:@xmath40 @xmath41 , after the mixing assuming a democratic number redistribution we expect @xmath38:@xmath39:@xmath40 @xmath42 .",
    "naturally in a more detailed balance the role of the most subtle and hidden parameter ( the neutrino mixing @xmath43 ) may be deforming the present averaged flavor balance . on the other side for the anti - neutrino fluxes we expect at the birth place : @xmath44:@xmath45:@xmath46 @xmath47",
    "while at their arrival ( within a similar democratic redistribution ) : @xmath44:@xmath45:@xmath46 @xmath48 .",
    "this neutrino flux , derived by gamma one , hold @xmath49 s duration and it is larger by two order of magnitude over the atmospheric one .",
    "therefore in present paper we conclude that , even if sk just marginally missed the solar neutrino flares ( see fig.[01],[02 ] ) , hyper kamiokande , hk , or megaton , titand @xcite , detectors should discover neutrino signals quite above threshold edge ( see fig.[03 ] ) .",
    "inner ice - cube @xmath50 may reach the threshold if ten gev neutrinos maybe observed .",
    "finally full @xmath51 icecube , being detecting at highest @xmath52 gev may or may - not reveal tens gev neutrinos ( as observed gamma found in milagro ones ) just at edge ( see fig.[04]).solar neutrino @xmath53 , @xmath54 flare after their mixing in two different upper bounds considered in early papers @xcite,@xcite , derived by solar flare energy equipartition in two solar corona density target .",
    "antineutrino exhibit similar fluxes over a noise - free solar antineutrino background @xcite . here",
    "the signal is derived , by pions connection and gamma detection of solar flare on 20 january @xmath0,@xcite in sk .",
    "while upper bounds appears well within sk detection , the observed lower gamma bound quite below , is just ( marginally ) out of the sk detection thresholds .",
    "this is consistent and it explains the solar flare neutrino absence ( sk private communication ) . the solar flare duration and power ( here and in next figures ) , from where we derived the expected neutrino signals are assumed about @xmath49 s long as powerful as the observed @xmath55 jan .",
    "@xmath0 event .",
    "the vertical arrows among the arcs describes our estimated solar flare neutrino flux windows .",
    "the vertical dotted blue lines is related to sk cut - threshold via neutrino - nucleon cc , whose cross - section is quite above the electron mass .",
    "the solar neutrino noise rules lowest energies , but not the tens mev energy band",
    ". in analogy the green dashed line , along @xmath54 , shows the muon neutrino thresholds,(near gev ) , just out sk detection .",
    "the different dotted lines split on from electrons , taus and the most inclined green ones for muons : indeed their penetrability is growing above the sk detector size , tens meters size , increasing their detections .",
    "red dot - dashed line shows rarest @xmath56 appearance by mixing and by large sun - earth distances .",
    "the same phenomenon is difficult for atmospheric neutrino because of shorter earth size ."
