    "non - abelian gauge theories like qcd are known to possess a rich vacuum structure .",
    "notably , there are topologically non - trivial vacuum fluctuations of the gauge fields , whose simplest examples are instantons  @xcite .",
    "instantons have been argued to play an important role in various long - distance aspects of qcd , such as giving a possible solution to the axial @xmath0 problem  @xcite or being at work in @xmath1 chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "recently , also a number of qcd lattice studies elucidated the topological structure and the instanton content of the vacuum  @xcite .",
    "another prominent feature of the qcd vacuum is its apparent dual superconductivity .",
    "the latter has been recognized since long as an explanation of confinement  @xcite and is also intensively studied on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "these investigations seem to indicate that the fundamental dual excitations are monopoles or vortices , while instantons might be composite objects of those .",
    "the qcd vacuum structure may be studied on the lattice , starting from first principles .",
    "alternatively , low - energy phenomenology can be exploited to learn about the vacuum , at the expense of introducing model assumptions as for example in the instanton liquid model  @xcite or in the model of the stochastic vacuum  @xcite , which incorporates the dual superconductor picture of the vacuum .    in this short review",
    ", i shall emphasize that manifestations of the vacuum structure of non - abelian gauge theories can also be searched for in high - energy scattering .",
    "i shall concentrate in sect .",
    "[ ihard ] on instanton - induced hard scattering processes in the electroweak gauge theory ( quantum flavor dynamics ( qfd ) )  @xcite and in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) in qcd  @xcite , which are calculable from first principles within instanton - perturbation theory . in sect .",
    "[ soft ] , i shall discuss briefly soft scattering processes in qcd .",
    "instantons ( @xmath2 ) are minima of the euclidean action , localized in space and euclidean time , with unit topological charge @xmath3 . in minkowski space - time , they describe tunneling transitions between classically degenerate , topologically inequivalent vacua , differing in their winding number by one unit , @xmath4  @xcite . the corresponding energy barrier , under which the instantons tunnel , is inversely proportional to the gauge coupling @xmath5 and the effective @xmath2-size @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and of order @xmath8 tev in qfd  @xcite and @xmath9 in hard scattering in qcd , where @xmath10 gev is a large momentum transfer e.g. in dis  @xcite .      due to axial anomalies  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath2-induced hard scattering processes are always associated with anomalous fermion - number violation  @xcite , in particular baryon plus lepton number violation , @xmath11 , in the case of qfd , chirality violation , @xmath12 , in the case of qcd .",
    "generically , @xmath2-induced total cross - sections for hard parton scattering processes are given in terms of an integral over the instanton - antiinstanton ( @xmath13 ) collective coordinates ( sizes @xmath14 , @xmath13 distance @xmath15 , color orientation @xmath16 )  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) @xmath17 here , the basic blocks arising in @xmath2-perturbation theory are the @xmath2-size distribution @xmath18 and the function @xmath19 , which takes into account the exponentiation of gauge boson production  @xcite and can be identified with the @xmath13-interaction defined via the valley method  @xcite .    the @xmath2-size distribution @xmath18 is known in @xmath2-perturbation theory , @xmath20 , up to two - loop renormalization group invariance  @xcite",
    ". at one - loop",
    ", it reads @xmath21 with @xmath22 the first coefficient in the @xmath23 function , @xmath24 the @xmath2-action , @xmath25 the renormalization scale , and @xmath26 a scheme - dependent constant .",
    "the quite differenct @xmath27 dependence of the size distribution  ( [ size - dist ] ) for qcd and qfd has important consequences for the predictivity : whereas large - size instantons , @xmath28 , are exponentially suppressed in qfd ( cf .",
    "( [ action ] ) ) and thus the relevant contributions to the size integrals in  ( [ gencross ] ) arise consistently from the perturbative region ( @xmath29 ) even if both initial partons are on - shell , @xmath30 , in qcd the power - law behavior of the size distribution , @xmath31 , generically causes the dominant contributions to  ( [ gencross ] ) to originate from large @xmath32 and thus often spoils the applicability of @xmath2-perturbation theory . in dis ( cf.fig.[kin-var ] ) , however , one parton , @xmath33 say , carries a space - like virtuality @xmath34 , such that the contribution of large instantons to the integrals is suppressed by an exponential factor in  ( [ gencross ] ) , @xmath35 , and @xmath2-perturbation theory becomes exploitable , i.e. predictable ,  for sufficiently large @xmath36  @xcite . in this connection",
    "it is quite welcome that lattice data on the instanton content of the quenched ( @xmath37 ) qcd vacuum  @xcite can be exploited to infer the region of validity of @xmath2-perturbation theory for @xmath18  @xcite : as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] ( left ) , there is very good agreement for @xmath38 fm .",
    "[ h ]     +    as far as the @xmath13-interaction @xmath19 is concerned , it is seen from simple fourier correspondences in  ( [ gencross ] ) , e.g. @xmath39 , that at high center - of - mass ( cm ) energies @xmath40 small @xmath13-distances are probed , i.e. @xmath41 ( dis ) or @xmath42 ( qfd ) .",
    "thus , in order to make a reliable prediction of @xmath2-induced hard scattering at high energies , we need to know the interaction for small distances . again , for qcd one may exploit lattice data on the @xmath13-distance distribution  @xcite to infer the region of validity of the description of the @xmath13-interaction by its exact expression given in the valley method  @xcite : one finds good agreement for @xmath43  @xcite ( cf .",
    "[ lattice ] ) . in this case",
    ", however , there are remaining theoretical ambiguities : the integrations over @xmath27 , @xmath44 in the @xmath13-distance distribution imply significant contributions also from larger instantons with @xmath45 fm , outside the strict region of perturbation theory .",
    "it is not excluded that the valley interaction reliably describes the interactions of small - size instantons , @xmath46 fm , at smaller @xmath47 , say  @xmath48 .",
    "[ h ]    the energy dependencies of the @xmath2-induced parton - parton cross sections illustrated in fig .",
    "[ isorho ] for dis ( @xmath49 )  @xcite and in fig .",
    "[ vlhc ] for qfd  @xcite are easily understood on the basis of above mentioned fourier correspondences and associated saddle - point relations : at increasing energies , smaller and smaller @xmath13-distances are probed , and the cross - sections are rapidly growing due to the attractive nature of the @xmath13-interaction in the perturbative semi - classical regime ( cf .",
    "[ lattice ] ( right ) ) .",
    "this goes along with the production of @xmath50 gauge bosons , in addition to the minimal number of fermions required by the axial anomaly .",
    "furthermore , in the case of dis , at increasing virtuality @xmath51 smaller and smaller instantons are probed and the cross - section diminishes in accord with the size distribution ( fig.[lattice ]  ( left ) ) .      with my colleague fridger schrempp",
    "we have conducted a long - term research program at desy to work out the theory and phenomenology of hard qcd @xmath2-induced processes in dis at hera  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the first dedicated search by the h1 collaboration has been published  @xcite .",
    "several observables characterising the hadronic final state of qcd @xmath2-induced events were exploited to identify a potentially @xmath2-enriched domain .",
    "the results obtained are intriguing but non - conclusive .",
    "while an excess of events with @xmath2-like topology over the expectation of the standard dis background is observed , which , moreover , is compatible with the @xmath2-signal , it can not be claimed to be significant given the uncertainty of the monte carlo simulations of the standard dis background .",
    "the data do not exclude the cross - section predicted by @xmath2-perturbation theory for quite small @xmath2-sizes @xmath52 fm and @xmath53 .",
    "[ h ]      in the early ",
    "90s the possibility of observable qfd @xmath2-effects at cm energies @xmath54 tev was quite intensively investigated  @xcite . but despite considerable theoretical efforts the actual size of the cross - sections in the relevant energy regime was never established . in view of the similarity between qfd and hard qcd @xmath2-induced processes in dis and of the recent information about the latter both from the lattice and from experiment , it seems worthwhile to reconsider the subject  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ vlhc ] represents a state - of - the - art evaluation of the qfd @xmath2-induced quark - quark cross - section , which neglects higgs production  @xcite .",
    "it demonstrates that the cross - section is unobservably small in the conservative fiducial region corresponding to @xmath55 .",
    "however , it becomes of observable size if the @xmath13-attraction remains valid also for slightly smaller values of @xmath56 at @xmath57 tev .",
    "this opens up exciting opportunities at future colliders  @xcite such as vlhc  @xcite or at cosmic ray facilities and neutrino telescopes  @xcite .",
    "one of the main challenges of qcd is to understand the high - energy , but small momentum transfer cross - sections of hadrons from first principles . in this domain ,",
    "perturbation theory is not applicable and direct lattice simulations are not possible until now .",
    "there have been recently several attempts to face this challenge  @xcite .",
    "most of them are based on the eikonal representation of the amplitudes in terms of correlators of wilson lines or loops  @xcite , which thereafter are evaluated using different model assumptions .",
    "the most advanced attempt is certainly the one of the heidelberg group  @xcite based on the model of the stochastic vacuum  @xcite , which has been already successfully applied to a variety of soft high - energy processes ( e.g.  @xcite ) . less developed but",
    "rapidly evolving is the understanding of a possible connection of semi - hard instantons to diffraction  @xcite .",
    "there exists the intriguing possibility that larger - size instantons build up diffractive scattering , with the marked @xmath2-size scale @xmath58 fm ( fig .",
    "[ lattice ] ( left ) ) being reflected in the conspicuous `` geometrization '' of soft qcd  @xcite .",
