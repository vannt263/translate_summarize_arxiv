    "it is generally accepted that the formation of a black hole proceeds with the formation of a marginally trapped surface ( the apparent horizon ) into which matter is collapsing and one that encloses a region of space interior to which the light cones are tipped [ 1 ] so much so that even outgoing null geodesics proceed toward ever decreasing values of the radial coordinate .",
    "the famous singularity theorems [ 2][3][4 ] , then posit that under certain assumptions on energy conditions of matter , the eventual state of the collapse is an infinite density singularity surrounded by an event horizon ( defined by the outermost trapped surface ) .",
    "it is , however , a fact that the existence of such a singularity is neither easy to verify nor refute observationally because of the limits set by the black hole event horizon . in the absence of such observational evidence , the compelling logic in the arguments leading to the singularity theorems has generally shaped the widespread conviction that indeed a black hole must contain a physical singularity .",
    "as is known , however , the picture of a singular black hole opens up several puzzles .",
    "for example , the existence of spacetime singularities results in irretrievably total information loss [ 5 ] . moreover , the infinite tidal forces that result from such a singularity formation lead to a breakdown in the descriptive power of general relativity [ 6 ] . as a result",
    "it is generally believed that the perceived final collapse state implied by the singularity theorems could be but a manifestation of the incompleteness of classical gravity and that a correct ( quantum ) theory of gravity will dispense with this singular final state and admit a state of finite ( albeit very high ) curvature .",
    "an altogether different view is that the singularities implied by the aforementioned theorems simply reflect our lack of knowledge of the properties of matter under extreme conditions .",
    "thus it has been suggested that the singularity theorems could be circumvented if ( some of ) the conditions imposed on the properties of collapsing matter were relaxed .",
    "indeed modern frameworks ( like string theory ) attempting to formulate a quantum theory of gravity seek the existence of a fundamental length scale and hence a singularity free spacetime .",
    "there are also philosophical questions as to whether spacetime can indeed accommodate singularities of any kind , be they from gravitational collapse or vacuum - induced [ 7 ] .    as a result of these and other considerations",
    "a renewed interest has grown lately with regard to spacetime singularities and their existence [ 8 ] .",
    "indeed the concept of non - singular collapse dates back to sakharov s consideration of the equation of state @xmath9 for a superdense fluid and gliner s view [ 9 ] that such a fluid could be the final state of gravitational collapse .",
    "such ideas are now attracting a growing amount of attention .",
    "for example , ellis [ 10 ] has argued that in the case of a closed universe a trapped surface does not necessarily lead to a singularity .",
    "recently the present authors have investigated an analogous argument with regard to black holes in [ 11 ] .",
    "it was pointed out in [ 11 ] that under physically acceptable energy conditions the expansion of the outgoing mode which assumes increasingly negative values in a trapped region can eventually turn around to ( even ) assume a positive signature inside a black hole .",
    "such behavior suggests the existence some interior region , surrounding the core , which is not trapped . in turn , this feature implies the absence of a singularity in such a spacetime . in recent years",
    ", several non - singular black hole solutions have been found .",
    "dymnikova , for example , [ 12 ] has constructed an exact solution of the einstein field equations for a non - singular black hole containing at the core a fluid de - sitter - like fluid with anisotropic pressure .",
    "this solution is petrov type [ ( ii),(ii ) ] by classification which however is different in both classification ( it is petrov type [ ii,(ii ) ] and physical interpretation . ] .",
    "another line of investigation in this area , initiated by markov [ 13 ] , suggests a limiting curvature approach .",
    "this idea has been explored further  by several authors , see for example [ 14][15][16][17][18][19 ] .",
    "a common feature in all these treatments is that the geometry of the spacetime in question is schwarschild at large @xmath4 as expected by birkoff s theorem , and de sitter - like at small @xmath4  values as implied by the @xmath10 equation of state assumed to prevail near @xmath3 .",
    "these approaches can be put in two broad classes .",
    "( a ) those for which the transition to this exotic `` state of matter can  be placed well inside the schwarzschild horizon [ 12 ] and ( b ) those which replace the entire volume of the schwarschild metric interior to @xmath11 by a substance with the @xmath10 equation of state [ 6 ] , dispensing in this way with the presence of the horizon altogether and the information paradox '' problems it engenders .",
    "the problem of transition from the usual matter equation of state to that appropriate for these non - singular solutions is usually not addressed at all .",
    "this problem is particularly acute for models of the second class discussed above , since the density at horizon formation scales like @xmath12 g @xmath13 and for objects of mass @xmath14 , is not greater than that of water , which is known to have an equation of state very different from @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , issues to do with direct matching of an external schwarschild vacuum to an interior de sitter have previously been discussed [ 20 ] based on junction conditions [ 21 ] .",
    "in fact , in terms of gravitational collapse the associated difficulties have been used to suggest modifications in some treatments [ 22 ] .",
    "the present work is motivated by these questions and is undertaken as a first effort to provide some answers by constructing models using an explicit equation of state with the desired properties .",
    "it would appear that the junction constraints [ 21 ] when applied to the end - product of non - singular gravitational collapse imply the matter fields across the schwarschild / de sitter boundary should have a radially dependent equation of state of the form @xmath15  that smoothly changes the matter - energy from a stiff fluid  to a cosmological constant .    the model sketched in this paper",
    "describes the geometry of a body that passed during its collapse through a stiff fluid state to settle into the final state of a non - singular black hole .",
    "the solution allows for a matter fluid region ( with a family of equations of state @xmath16 which envelopes an intermediate region with a family of equations of state @xmath17 which in turn envelopes a de sitter like region with @xmath18 at the center .",
    "our model differs both from the traditional singular black hole solutions which introduce matter at the singularity and from the relatively new non - singular solutions which usually introduced only a de sitter - like spacetime inside the black hole .",
    "the main feature of our model is that it    \\(1 ) introduces gravitating matter inside a non - singular black hole and    \\(2 ) offers a reasonable explanation of how part of this matter can evolve towards a de sitter - like vacuum to provide the radial tension or negative pressure that supports the remaining matter fields against the formation of a singularity .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the equations to be solved .",
    "we also construct the working equation of state and discuss some of its desirable features . in section 3",
    "we solve the einstein field equations for the desired geometry and obtain an exact solution .",
    "in section 4 we highlight the physical implications of the model .",
    "section 5 concludes the discussion .",
    "it is assumed , for simplicity , that the collapsed object can be reasonably described by a spherical , static geometry .",
    "the desired line element then takes the general form @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are to be determined from the einstein field equations @xmath22    under the assumed spacetime symmetry , eqs.2 reduce to@xmath23    @xmath24    and @xmath25 here @xmath26  @xmath27 is the energy density , @xmath28 is the radial pressure and @xmath29 is the tangential pressure . in this treatment",
    "the fluid is anisotropic with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the spacetime is thus petrov type [ ii , ( ii ) ] , where ( ) implies a degeneracy in the eigenvalues of the  weyl tensor .      in the remaining part of this section",
    "we construct the working equation of state @xmath32 in the radial direction which reproduces the characteristics of the collapsed body as highlighted in the previous section .",
    "we justify the choice by pointing out its desired features . on the other hand ,",
    "the tangential pressure equation of state @xmath33 will be derived later from the einstein field equations ( eq .",
    "2.5 ) using the radial pressure function @xmath32 to be constructed .",
    "the main desired features are that ( 1 ) the equation of @xmath34 change from the one associated with the usual matter , at low densities , to that associated with the de sitter geometry at sufficiently high densities near the center of the configuration and ; ( 2 ) that this change be well - behaved . to this end",
    "we consider an equation of state that takes the general form where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are , yet to be determined , positive real numbers and @xmath37 is a free parameter to be constrained .",
    "this equation implies presence of a@xmath38 \\left ( \\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_{\\max}}\\right ) ^{1/n}\\rho ,    \\tag{2.6}\\ ] ] maximum limiting density @xmath39 concentrated in a region of size @xmath40 , the core region of the configuration .",
    "one notes that the main desirable features are readily apparent in the functional form of eq .",
    "2.6 . at low densities , @xmath41 ,",
    "the equation of state reduces to that of a polytrope of index @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) while for @xmath44 the pressure decreases to eventually approach that of the vacuum @xmath45 as @xmath46 .",
    "we look for the simplest form of eq .",
    "2.6 by judiciously constraining both the indices @xmath35 and @xmath42 and the parameter @xmath37 .    since eq . 6",
    "already satisfies the general features desired by the model , its specific form , based on an appropriate choice of the indices @xmath35 and @xmath42 and the parameter @xmath37 is made through the demand that it must satisfy the following basic conditions .",
    "\\(1 ) it must have no pathologies , i.e.    ( i ) the sound speed @xmath47 can not be a maximum at @xmath48    ( ii ) in order to rule out superluminal behavior , @xmath49 , the maximum sound speed , i.e. the value of @xmath47 at the point where @xmath50 must be given by @xmath51 .",
    "\\(2 ) it must satisfy minimum acceptable energy conditions , namely the weak energy condition , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and the dominant energy condition , @xmath52 , @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath55 $ ] and the @xmath56 $ ] cases are both pathological ( they do not satisfy ( i ) above ) and will therefore be discarded .",
    "the next simplest potential choices are @xmath57 $ ] and @xmath58 $ ] . both these forms , apparently , manifest no pathologies of the previous cases . in both cases",
    "the sound speed vanishes @xmath59 at vanishing density @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore for @xmath61 the sound speed @xmath62 is initially an increasing function of @xmath63 , as expected in reality ? ? .",
    "one can therefore demand in each case ( i.e. for fixed @xmath35 and @xmath42 values ) that the maximum sound speed coincide with that of light i.e. the extremum sound speed at @xmath50 be given by @xmath64 in order to rule out superluminal behavior .",
    "these conditions also suffice to determine the parameter @xmath37 and allow the fulfillment of the energy conditions in ( 2 ) . solving @xmath65 and @xmath64 simultaneously for the @xmath66 $ ] case , i.e. fixes @xmath37 at @xmath67 or @xmath68",
    "( we keep only the positive solution ) .",
    "similarly for the @xmath58 $ ] one fixes @xmath37 to @xmath69 .",
    "we will select the quartic function corresponding to @xmath70 as the representative form for our model equation of state , in part because , unlike the cubic form , it unambiguously provides only one possible value of @xmath37 and makes the interpretation simpler .",
    "2.6 now takes the form @xmath71 \\left ( \\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_{\\max}}\\right ) \\rho ,    \\tag{2.7}\\ ] ] with the constraint that @xmath72 .",
    "it is the equation of state we adapt throughout the remaining part of the paper .    a few words on the behavior of our assumed equation of state .",
    "while no explicit microscopic prescription leading to its form is presently given , we consider that its softening past the stiff \" ( @xmath73 ) state and its eventual conversion to an equation of state appropriate to that of the vacuum ( @xmath9 ) , is effected by the coupling of matter to a scalar field akin to that of higgs that gives rise to particle masses .",
    "the dominance of the pressure by terms which render it negative is considered to imply that eventually the energy associated with the self interaction of this field provides the dominant contribution to the energy momentum tensor , which is assumed to be that of a perfect fluid .    in this paper",
    "no attempt is made to follow the dynamical evolution of the collapse .",
    "instead it is assumed that the collapsed body has already reached static equilibrium from its collapse .",
    "thus , we only investigate the characteristics of the various static 2-surfaces as the radial coordinate decreases from the matter surface @xmath74 to the body center @xmath3 .",
    "since our anticipated solution will allow matter fields we can , with no loss of generality , take for initial conditions on the collapsed body surface @xmath75 to be @xmath76 .",
    "we therefore expect to have four regions in this spacetime which must be satisfied by the expected solution .",
    "region i : schwarzschild vacuum : @xmath77 , @xmath78    region ii : regular matter fields : @xmath79    region iii : quintessential fields : @xmath80    region iv : @xmath81vacuum : @xmath82    the solution to eqs .",

    "2.8 and 2.9 imply there is an interior region which includes the family of surfaces @xmath91 and which interfaces with region i on the outer side and region iv on the inner side .",
    "the entire spacetime must therefore satisfy regularity conditions at the two interfaces @xmath74  and @xmath92 .",
    "put simply , such conditions guarantee ( i ) continuity of the mass function and ( ii ) continuity of the pressure across the interfacing hyperfaces .",
    "thus at each interface , i.e. @xmath93 and @xmath94 we must have   @xmath95 _ { \\mid r = r_{i } } & = 0 ,   \\nonumber \\\\ &   \\tag{2.10 } \\\\ \\left [ p^{+}-p^{-}\\right ] _ { \\mid r = r_{i } } & = 0 ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath96  and @xmath97 , @xmath98  refer to the exterior and interior values respectively and @xmath99 .",
    "a desirable feature of the model ( as we find later ) is the smooth continuity of the density and pressure between region ii and region iii .",

    "in this paper we have suggested a possible model for a non - singular black hole as a product of gravitational collapse . it is an exact solution of the einstein equations , being type [ ii , ( ii ) ] by petrov classification .",
    "this model is based on a judicious choice we have made of the equation of state of the collapsed matter . at high densities",
    "this equation of state violates some of the energy conditions [ 2][3 ] originally used to justify the existence of black hole singularities . in our model",
    "this violation leads to non - singular collapse . on the other hand , for the entire density parameter space",
    "the equation of state in our approach still satisfies the weak energy condition @xmath52 , @xmath53 , a basic requirement for physical fields .",
    "the solution depicts a spacetime with matter fluids in the outer layers ( region ii ) which , as one moves deeper inside , give way to either a quintessential or a two - fluid region iii .",
    "region iii , in turn , evolves into region iv , an inner - most core with de sitter characteristics .",
    "the fluids in regions iii and iv both provide the negative pressures needed to sustain the outer matter in static equilibrium .",
    "the solution has the required asymptotic forms , reducing to the schwarzschild vacuum solution outside the matter fields and reducing to the de sitter solution as one approaches the black hole center .",
    "the existence of region iii renders the interface between matter fields and the de sitter vacuum to join smoothly .",
    "this is because both the density @xmath111 , the radial pressure @xmath109 and the tangential pressure @xmath199 profiles and their derivatives are continuous .",
    "this character of the fields makes the matching across associated interfaces natural .",
    "using our model we have , in section iv , offered two viable interpretations about the possible macro - state of the fields making up the total energy of the black hole .",
    "these interpretations are based on two pictures , namely a quintessential picture and a two fluid picture . in both cases",
    "we have estimated the fractional contribution of the regular matter - like fields as a fraction of the total black hole energy .",
    "we find for an upper bound  the same value of @xmath200 in both cases . as a corollary",
    ", our model suggests that the lower bound for the amount of matter that is found in the exotic `` state can be as small as @xmath201 of the entire configuration of the collapsed matter . both the size and density of this de sitter - like central core region will depend on the details of the microscopic physics that lead to the specific equation of state we have employed , which go beyond the scope of the present work",
    "however , these considerations are consistent with our present notions of dynamical particle masses and symmetry breaking , as the density of this state is much higher than those produced to - date in the laboratory .",
    "the precise value is uncertain but it has to be at least as high as @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the mass of the higgs field , and it can be as high as the planck density .",
    "our entire non - singular configuration is well within the horizon of the black hole and in this respect the configuration is very different from some previous treatments , e.g. [ 6 ] . in these treatments , the field configuration fills the entire volume interior to @xmath11 with a fluid with @xmath9 , whose energy density for sufficiently large black holes can be smaller than that of water .",
    "this raises the difficult problem of converting matter from the usual equations of state to the exotic '' @xmath204 under usual laboratory conditions .",
    "finally , the model leaves some issues unresolved .",
    "first , the calculation for these mass fractions is based on assuming that in the region @xmath166 both the pressure and the density are well - behaved , functions in the radial coordinate @xmath4 , so that conversely @xmath205 well defined in the entire parameter space of @xmath111 . since in our model @xmath206 when @xmath119",
    ", then @xmath207 vanishes at @xmath208 forcing ( in the mass calculation ) the de sitter state to appear virtually at the origin .",
    "it is in this sense that @xmath209 is an upper - bound .",
    "one can reduce this fraction by using @xmath210 in the calculations , instead .",
    "however since we do nt know the radial extent the de sitter field could fill at the core , or whether indeed it fills any space bigger than the planck length we can not presently constrain @xmath211from below .",
    "this is one issue for quantum gravity to settle .",
    "secondly , our classical model can not distinguish between the two pictures offered to determine which choice of the matter macrostate is the correct one .",
    "however , the fact that in the region @xmath166 the energy - momentum tensor elements @xmath111 and @xmath212 are well - behaved functions of the radial coordinate @xmath4 may provide an interesting insight .",
    "it suggests that one can associate a unique value of the energy - momentum tensor on each 2-surface in the family @xmath213 .",
    "one can further speculate that , such a configuration may even be quantizable .",
    "in such a case the information pertaining to the pre - collapse phase of the object would not be lost but would now reside on the ( quantized ) onion - like family of hyperfaces @xmath214 inside the black hole .",
    "this is another issue for quantum gravity to settle .",
    "these results suggest a need for further investigation .",
    "@xmath216  with @xmath217 . at a when @xmath218 , then @xmath219  and @xmath220 .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath221  is chosen so that for the entire density parameter space @xmath222  the sound speed is not superluminal .",
    "the point b giving the maximum slope corresponds to the maximum sound speed , @xmath223 , chosen to correspond to the light speed , @xmath224 .",
    "point c is the critical point @xmath225 , and for @xmath226 , then @xmath216  is a decreasing function . at point d or @xmath227",
