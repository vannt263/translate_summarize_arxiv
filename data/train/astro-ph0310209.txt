    "with the progress of modern physics and astronomy , our outlook on the universe is dramatically changing from the stationary universe to the dynamic , ever changing , universe .",
    "the dynamical phenomena in the universe appear as variations at various time - scales ranging from the cosmological evolutionary time scale to less than a milisecond .",
    "these time - variations are becoming actually observable with the advent of the modern observing equipment and technology . among them , time - variations arising from extreme gravity as best exemplified by black holes , and from degenerate objects , such as white dwarfs and neutron stars , have been receiving extreme attention from various fields of modern science , as the natural laboratory of general relativity and quantum mechanics , which best represent the glorious success of the  century of physics \" .    as can be easily expected from the extreme conditions , astronomical phenomena under strong gravity or in degenerate conditions have extremely short time - scales , and",
    "are known to be usually very unpredictable .",
    "these astronomical phenomena are now generally called  transient phenomena \" , or referred to as  transient objects \" .",
    "the concept of _ transient object astronomy _ appeared very late in the history of astronomy and now flourishing as a new modality of astrophysical research . , the vsnet is the earliest group which began using the term _ transient objects _ in the present context of astronomical significance . ]",
    "this success greatly owed to the recent great advancement of observing modalities , information technology and computational astrophysics . the variable star network ( vsnet ) ,",
    "the objective of this review , is one of the earliest and most successful international groups that led to the modern success of transient object astronomy .      in the research history of _",
    "transient object astronomy _",
    ", there were two major breakthroughs in the early 1990 s .",
    "the one is the development of easy availability of ccds and personal computers , and the other is the advent of the internet .",
    "these two breakthroughs played a key role in establishing _",
    "transient object astronomy _ as one of the most popular contemporary astronomy topics .    from the traditional viewpoint ,",
    "ccds were usually used as a  faint - end \" extension of the former photon detection methods , e.g. photoelectric and photographic observations .",
    "this naturally led to a pursuit of observing fainter stars on long - exposure ccd images ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the founder of the vsnet was one of the first to break this tradition , and was virtually the first person who systematically turned modern ccd equipment to bright , transient objects , such as classical novae and outbursting dwarf novae ( the best examples being @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , see the later sections for their scientific achievements ) . the traditional time - resolved observations of classical novae and outbursting dwarf novae were almost restricted to so - called target - of - opportunity ( too ) observations .",
    "the best traditional examples include the 1978 outburst of wz sge ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the 1986 outburst of sw uma @xcite .",
    "this kind of observations was usually severely limited by the telescope time allocation , and many important transient phenomena ( e.g. the 1985 historical long outburst of u gem : @xcite ) faded away without receiving sufficient observational coverage .",
    "traditional proposals for telescope time were also limited because of the transient and unpredictable nature of these phenomena ; there is no guarantee that there is a suitable transient target at the time of allocated observation .",
    "for this reason , systematic observational research in these objects was severely restricted to short - period , less unpredictable objects , with an enormous effort of world - wide coordination ( e.g. vw hyi : @xcite ; @xcite ; yz cnc : @xcite ) .",
    "timely circulation of alerts on transient objects or phenomena is also crucially important , particularly for too - type observation . before the wide availablity of the internet ,",
    "the typical way of communicating such alerts was a phone call from an observer ( usually an amateur astronomer watching variable stars ) to a variable star organization , which was typically relayed ( with some delay ) to local observers for confirmation .",
    "the information , if it was recognized as particularly important , was then distributed to world - wide observers usually from the central bureau of astronomical telegrams ( cbat ) via telegrams , direct phone calls , or slow postcards .",
    "it usually took , even in best cases , a day or more before this crucial information was relayed to the actual observer undertaking a too observation .",
    "the early stage of transient objects was usually missed because of this delay .",
    "for example , the detection of the 1986 historical outburst of sw uma was relayed via an astronomical telegram only when the object reached a historical brightness of @xmath09 , although the outburst was initially reported @xmath11.5 below the peak brightness .",
    "there had been very few early stage observations ( i.e. within a day of the event detection ) of transient objects before the 1990 s .",
    "this situation drastically changed with the public availability of the internet . in the early times",
    "( around 19901991 ) , there were only sporadic internet communications on observations , mainly via personal e - mails and on public bulletin board systems .",
    "this strategy worked slightly better than in the past , the situation was basically unchanged in that most of observers had to rely on occasional communications or a slow access to news materials .    from the necessity of publicly and electronically disseminating urgent astronomical phenomena , there appeared e - mail exploders ( mailing lists ) .",
    "the scandinavian _ varstars _ list and the ( mainly ) professional _ novanet _ by the arizona state university team played an early important role in publicly relaying information on transient objects .",
    "the early - time progress of these electronic communications is summarized in the _ vsnet - history _ list.http://www.kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp/vsnet/mail/vsnet-history/ + maillist.html@xmath2 . ]",
    "( 160mm,80mm)fig1.eps    the scientific role of wide - availability of these e - mail exploders was recognized upon the appearance of sn 1993j in m 81 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this supernova showed an unusual early - time light curve and a spectral transition from a type - ii to type - ib supernova ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in communicating nightly rapid changes and distributing most up - to - date observation strategies",
    ", the e - mail exploders played a more crucial role than ever .",
    "another advantage of e - mail exploders as a _ standardization tool _ of observations became evident ( figure [ fig : sn93jcht ] ) .",
    "early - time non - standard observations were quickly corrected using the updated photometric comparison stars , and questionable observations were examined real - time to clarify the cause .",
    "this led to a huge world compilation of sn 1993j photometry updates ( see figure [ fig : sn93j ] ) contributed by a number of volunteers , including the vsnet founder.ftp://vsnet.kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp/pub/vsnet/sne/ + sn1993j / sn.mag@xmath2 ] this high - quality , uniform compilation of real - time observations greatly contributed to real - time theoretical modeling of this object ( e.g. @xcite ) , spectroscopy ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and photometry ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we published our own results in @xcite .",

    "( 160mm,80mm)fig2.eps      upon the recognition of the importance of e - mail exploders on the occasion of sn 1993j , more systematic efforts were taken to standardize the communication and data reporting method . in relation to reporting observations , we started widely disseminating observations of regular variable star observations , mainly submitted to the variable star observers league in japan ( vsolj),http://www.kusastro.kyoto - u.ac.jp / vsnet / vsolj / vsolj.html@xmath2 and see @xmath4http://vsolj.cetus - net.org/@xmath2 for the vsolj variable star bulletin page . ] and those personally reported to us .",
    "people started recognizing the scientific importance of widely disseminating regular observations , which can be readily reflected on scheduling new observations .",
    "new findings based on widely reported observations ( e.g. superhump detection of a dwarf nova ) were also relayed real - time , which worked as a positive feedback to original observers .",
    "the prototype of vsnet - type e - mail exploders was thus established in 1993 .",
    "the next major astronomical event at this stage of the history was the discovery of nova cas 1993 ( v705 cas ) .",
    "this nova showed considerable degree of early - time fluctuations , as well as a later dust - forming episode . during all of the stages of evolution of the nova explosion ,",
    "the data circulating strategy established at the time of sn 1993j played an impressive role : the comprehensive compilation of v705 cas by yasuto takenaka ( see figure [ fig : v705 ] ) was cited in a nature paper @xcite as best authenticated optical record of this nova .",
    "the nova was later even symbolically called _ an electronic nova _",
    "@xcite , representing the opening of new electronic era of transient object astronomy .",
    "( 160mm,80mm)fig3.eps      the information of these transient objects and regular variable star observations was initially relayed manually , or relayed on existing less specified e - mail exploder systems . in 1994 , our own e - mail exploder system ( vsnet ) started working .",
    "this service smoothly took over the past manual e - mail announcement systems , and immediately received wide attention both from amateur and professional communities .",
    "the establishment of the vsnet thus became the  prototype \" of world - wide amateur - professional collaborations based on public e - mail communication .",
    "this initiative later led to a flourishing vsnet collaboration ( section [ sec : vsnetcollab ] ) .",

    "since we already had sufficient experience with relaying vsolj reports to the world - wide variable star observers , it was a natural solution to extend the vsolj format to an international version .",

    "all these reports were immediately circulated through the vsnet alert network ; the resultant vigil eventually enabled the historical detection of this perfectly unexpected giant outburst .",
    "following our notification , a corresponding x - ray outburst was found in the backlog recorded with the rxte / asm ; the x - ray outburst was not discovered  real - time \" even with x - ray all - sky monitor .",
    "the x - ray outburst , after reaching an astonishing flux of 12 crab at the x - ray maximum , rapidly faded and returned to the pre - outburst level within only 2 hours ( @xcite ) .",
    "the duration of the optical outburst was also short ( @xmath27 d ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the vsnet collaboration team performed prompt observation of this short x - ray outburst , and revealed that the optical variation exhibited anti - correlation against the x - ray variation ( @xcite ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations revealed that v4641 sgr consists of a black hole and a late b - type star ( @xcite ) .",
    "as reported below , v4641 sgr experienced active phases in the next couple of years ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , however , no comparable outburst to the 1999 september giant one has been yet observed .",
    "while their binary components are totally different , the short outbursts of v4641 sgr and ci cam have several common characteristics : first , spatially resolved radio jets were associated with the outburst in both systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "second , the peak luminosities reached the eddington luminosity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "their high luminosity implies that supercritical accretion occurred .",
    "since the matter falls with almost free - fall time scale in the supercritical accretion , the problem of the short duration of the outbursts can be reconciled .",
    "the optical  x - ray anti - correlation of v4641 sgr may be understood with the scenario that the optically - thick supercritical accretion flow absorbed the x - ray emission and re - emitted the optical emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is , however , still unknown how the supercritical accretion was induced .",
    "( 150mm,90mm)fig11.eps      in the classical picture , the optical emission is thermal emission from the outer portion of the accretion disk where the temperature is relatively low ( @xmath28 k ) . the observed time scale of optical variations is hence long , such as superhumps ( e.g. @xcite ) and orbital period variations ( e.g. @xcite ) . the black hole binary system , gx 339 - 4 is , however , known to show rapid optical variations of the time scale of seconds ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such short time scale variations indicate that they originate from an inner portion of the accretion flow .",
    "they are proposed to be cyclo - synchrotron emission from the inner region ( @xcite ) , however , the mechanism to generate the emission and variations is poorly known .",
    "the vsnet collaboration team has recently observed optical rapid variations of two sources , that is , xte j1118 + 480 = kv uma ( @xcite ) and v4641 sgr ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "xte j1118 + 480 was discovered with the rxte / asm on 2000 march 29 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we discovered an optical counterpart at 12.92 mag on march 30 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the optical light curve showed so many fluctuations that @xcite suggested the presence of optical rapid variations .",
    "@xcite detected optical short - term ( a few tens of seconds ) variations which correlate with the x - ray variations .",
    "these rapid optical variations are also proposed to be synchrotron emission from the inner accretion flow ( @xcite ) . since xte j1118 + 480 remained at a low / hard state throughout the outburst , the inner region",
    "is considered to be filled not by the standard disk , but by the advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf : @xcite ) . in the adaf region ,",
    "the gas density is so low that the magnetic pressure is dominant ( @xcite ) .",
    "the optical rapid variations are probably generated at shock regions in such an inner region , which are formed by magnetic reconnections or collisions of blobs in the magnetically - dominated accretion flow ( @xcite ) .",
    "after the luminous , short outburst in 1999 september , v4641 sgr experienced a new active phase in 2002 and 2003 .",
    "the vsnet collaboration succeeded in detecting rapid optical variations during the 2002 active state ( figure [ fig : v4641flash ] ) , whose detailed features and interpretation are reported in @xcite in this volume .",
    "superhumps , which have been originally studied in su uma - type dwarf novae , are also observed in soft x - ray transients ( e.g. @xcite ) . to observe the evolution of superhumps was difficult in the case of soft x - ray transients because of their rare outbursts , relatively long orbital period , and long durations of outbursts made a dense sampling throughout outbursts difficult .",
    "our intense campaign of xte j1118 + 480 , however , first revealed the evolution of superhumps in soft x - ray transients ( @xcite ) .",
    "the superhump period was first 0.43% longer than the orbital period , and then decreased during the main outburst .",
    "superhumps in su uma - type dwarf novae also exhibit this behavior , which can be interpreted by the contraction of the elliptical accretion disk @xcite or the inward propagation of the eccentricity wave @xcite .",
    "it is proposed that the reflare is induced by the growing tidal dissipation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this model was developed based on the fact that superhumps appeared only after the reflare ( @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , superhumps appeared even before the reflare in xte j1118 + 480 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the vsnet collaboration obtained a dense sample around the reflare of xte j1859 + 226 , which is reported in @xcite in this issue .",
    "we detected periodic variations , which may be superhumps , even before the reflare of xte j1859 + 226 .",
    "these observations are unfavorable for the above scenario for the reflare .",
    "it is also proposed that strong x - ray irradiation onto the outer accretion disk may induce the reflare ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the programs were originally written for microcomputers running on ms - dos@xmath7 , and later ported to linux .",
    "the following information is mainly an excerpt from @xcite , partly rewritten for the recent changes for the vsnet management .",
    "the vsnet reporting format is an ut extension of the vsolj electronic reporting format , whose design was established in 1987 .",
    "the standard format vsnet observations are composed of lines separated by new - line characters . since a full description of the format used in these data or files",
    "may not be necessary to all readers , the minimal requirements to interpret the data which are made available through the vsnet world - wide web service .",
    "each line contains the following items .",
    "1 .   name of the object 2 .",
    "time of the observation in decimals of ut 3 .   observed magnitude 4 .",
    "magnitude system ( ccd / photoelectric ) or film and filter ( photographic ) 5 .   observer s code    these items were designed to express original observations as exactly as possible ( mainly in terms of significant digits ) .",
    "comparison stars , charts used , or any other text information can be written as a comment following the item ( d ) ; they are usually used for future reference or examination , and not directly used at present in the vsnet regular database management .",
    "each item is separated by one or more space characters ( ascii code 20 in hexadecimal ) and does not contain spaces within the item .",
    "this is an identifier for the object .",
    "if the name is unique enough to discriminate the object from other celestial objects , any expression is basically allowed ; the use of the names listed in the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs ) , beyer names , numbers in the new catalogue of suspected variable stars ( nsv ) , and durchmusterung numbers ( bd , cd , cpd ) , however , is strongly recommended . when there is no specific relevant catalog , the use of gsc and usno identifier can be used .    for gcvs and beyer names , three - letter iau code of constellation ( in upper - case letters )",
    "precedes the name of the star in the constellation .",
    "greek letters are written in the standard english expressions .    [ cols= \" <",
    ", < \" , ]     translation of reported names into standard expressions , when necessary , is performed either automatically or manually using the _ alias _ database .",
    "this process particularly becomes necessary when new gcvs names are released in the form of regular name - list updates , or when a new gcvs designation is given for a new nova .",
    "all the name translation rules are centralized in the _ alias _ database and reflected on the entire vsnet system , eliminating additional efforts to modify individual observation reports or expressions in vsnet circulars .",
    "this is an great advantage of the vsnet database managing process , and a newly released name - list update ( containing some hundreds of newly designated variable stars ) can be usually reflected within a day of the release .",
    "observers are allowed to continue using the old expressions as long as the expressions can be uniquely and automatically translated into the new expressions .      in order to facilitate detecting errors by eye ,",
    "times are expressed in the following decimal format using utc .",
    "example : 20030701.123 ( 2003 july 1.123 utc )",
    ".    no heliocentric or barycentric corrections are introduced at this stage .",
    "the conversion to tai or td ( in any expression including julian date ) , or helio-(or bary-)centric corrections are left to data analysis software and users .",
    "these measures are partly because widely used software packages at the observer s end are known to frequently contain problems .",
    "the other reason is that leap seconds do not allow to distribute fixed tables for conversion beforehand .",
    "decimal points are explicitly used to show the significant digits .",
    "upper limit observation ( non - detection ) is expressed by a prefix ` @xmath48 ' .",
    "expression may be followed by one of ` : ' or ` ? ' to show uncertainty .",
    "if the observation is visually performed , this item is not necessary .",
    "otherwise , the code of the magnitude system ( or the film and the filter if the observation is done photographically ) follows the item ( c ) without placing a space .",
    "well - defined standard photoelectric systems ( e.g. johnson - cousins @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath5 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) systems are used as in usual sense .",
    "other vsnet - specific codes include  c \" ( unspecified unfiltered ccd magnitude ) ,  cr \" ( unfiltered ccd magnitude calibrated on @xmath51-band ) and  p \" ( unspecified photographic magnitude ) .",
    "the complete list of the codes representing the films and filters at present is available at the vsnet website.http://www.kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp/vsnet/etc/format.html@xmath2 . ]",
    "example : @xmath4815.5rc ( fainter than 15.5 in @xmath51-band )      the code is usually a three - letter code , as canonically used by the american association of variable star observers ( aavso)http://www.aavso.org@xmath2 . ] and the vsolj .",
    "the code may be immediately followed by a period mark ( ` . ' ) and the organization code .",
    "when there is no fixed affiliation for the observer , the vsnet manager group issues a code , which scheme also enables archiving historical or literature observations .    with this format , each line of observation has all information in itself ; any operation of moving lines in a data file ( such as sorting ) does not affect the properties of the data .",
    "the above design of electronic data has greatly facilitated overall aspects of the following electronic data management , and this pioneering concept has been taken over by a number of world - wide variable star organizations .",
    "most of programs are written in the language c , and were originally compiled with turbo - c ( borland international ) . many of machine - independent source codes ( handling text - based data ) can be compiled by ansi c ( ansi x3.159 ) compilers ( such as gcc ) without much correction . in the actual vsnet database management ,",
    "these codes are either compiled on windows@xmath7/dos personal computers , or linux workstations .",
    "most of the text - based works are currently done on linux workstations .    besides storing original data as text files ( as reported in vsnet - obs )",
    ", they are also incorporated into an observational database in rewritable media allowing random access .",
    "several interesting graphic programs and data analysis programs run in this mode .",
    "the maximum number of observations handled at one time depends only on capacity of the media and the addressing capacity of the operating system .",
    "for example , we now handle dynamic and random access to the entire vsnet observations , consisting of more than 1.2 million visual observations ( @xmath1130 mb ) of randomly accessible data , and we have registered more than 1.3 million ccd observations submitted to the vsnet collaboration . we have also confirmed that a combination test of the vsnet , vsolj and afoev public data ( about 3 million observation ) has yielded satisfactory efficiency of handling a huge volume of randomly accessible data .",
    "in addition to the observational database , there also exist other system databases including _ vartype _ ( database on individual variable star types ) , and _ alias _",
    "( name resolver database ) .",
    "a programmer on this system can inquire these databases for the type of variability or the standard expression of the name for the object specified by a given identifier .",
    "because the number of the data or the objects is very large , and both random and sequential accesses are necessary for easy operation on the light curves , we adopted the combination of b+tree and bidirectional linear list .",
    "this basic structure of the database was originally established in 1989 to fully incorporate the vsolj database .",
    "complete data of observations ( other than remarks ) are stored in a file equivalent to an index file of an relational database , and there is no need for reading an additional data file .",
    "the size of a storage block is 16 kilobytes , but this can be modified upon different compilation .",
    "the main memory is dynamically allocated to simulate a virtual memory in order to minimize access to the storage media . with this feature ,",
    "the main database module only requires an order of a few hundreds of megabytes of actual memory .",
    "the kernel of the database module is written transparently to the upper modules , so upper modules have only to pass the key or the virtual address to the kernel to inquire the next or the previous data .",
    "the modules are written to enable simultaneous handling of multiple databases ( e.g. observational database and _ vartype _ ) without interference .",
    "the database functions are prepared as a form of c - language based application interface ( api ) , but we skipped the details of individual apis because they are too technical to be presented in this paper .",
    "basic user operations to the database can be performed by command - line tasks on ms - dos@xmath7 or linux .",
    "the most frequently used and basic commands include :    1 .",
    "creates a new database .",
    "2 .   merges a text file to a database .",
    "3 .   deletes data specified by a text file from a database .",
    "4 .   merges an observational data file in the standard format to the observational database , and lists potential errors by referring to the previously registered data and _ vartype _ database .",
    "lists data of a given object for a given chronological period . 6 .",
    "replaces an identifier for an object by another .",
    "7 .   lists all data in a database . 8 .",
    "lists all stars in a database .",
    ".   selects data from a text file by specifying types of variability , by referring to the _ vartype _ database .",
    "checks observation data file if they contain newly reported objects by comparison with the existing observational database .. 11 .",
    "checks observation data file for grammar , and lists discordant data and potential errors by referring to the previously registered data and _ vartype _ database . 12 .",
    "returns the variable star type by referring to the _ vartype _ database . 13 . sets or modifies the variable star type in the _ vartype _ database .",
    "14 . converts a variable star name to the standard name by referring to _ alias _ database .",
    "15 . sets or modifies the entry in the _ alias _ database ( this command has a different name on linux because of the collision with the shell built - in command ) .",
    "most basic operations on the vsnet data are done with these basic commands , and are frequently used as a combination regulated by a shell script .",
    "most of these programs use a gui .",
    "these packages are architecture - specific , and presently run in limited environments ( e.g. nec pc 9801 machines ) , although efforts have been taken to port these applications to windows@xmath7 operating system , or to write an equivalent wrapper gui applications written in java@xmath7 .",
    "figure [ fig : bl ] shows a sample image by * grp * interactive light curve viewer program .",
    "( 170mm,90mm)fig20.eps    1",
    ".   displays light curves , and enables interactive zooming , data selection , data editing .",
    "displays and prints light curves automatically . an equivalent package written in java@xmath7",
    "is presently used to produce vsnet online light curves .",
    "3 .   automatically produces vsnet cv circulars .      besides drawing light curves ,",
    "there also exist several kinds of scientific data - analysis programs . some require databases and others require only data files in the text format",
    "a few samples are shown here .",
    "many of the general - purpose programs ( mostly with source codes ) are available from the vsnet website  tools and programs \" section.http://www.kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp/vsnet/etc/prog.html@xmath2 . ]",
    "we have implemented both conventional heliocentric corrections for the observed jds , by using the well - known newcomb s expansion of the planets .",
    "we have also implemented barycentric corrections by numerically integrating the de 200 ephemeris produced by nasa .",
    "the original source code of the de 200 ephemeris was imported from a software package written by mr .",
    "novas .",
    "we have our own implementations of discrete fourier transform ( dft ) , phase dispersion minimization ( pdm : @xcite ) , discrete wavelet transform ( dwt : @xcite ) and other period analysis tools .",
    "the pdm package was ported to windows@xmath7 by andreas wijaya , and has been conveniently used by many users .",
    "cv circulars were originally prepared monthly and issued by the vsolj , from the observations reported by the end of the next month . in the modern vsnet service , these circulars are issued almost daily to fully incorporate the daily changes in the rapidly varying cvs .",
    "the corresponding list is _ vsnet - cvcirc_.http://www.kusastro.kyoto - u.ac.jp / vsnet / mail / vsnet - cvcirc / maillist.html@xmath2 . ]",
    "cv circulars contain information about all reported outbursts and standstills of dwarf novae in the form of nightly averages , and nightly averages of other peculiar objects ( cvs other than dwarf novae , x - ray binaries , symbiotic variables , eruptive variable such as r crb stars , s dor stars , fu ori stars , and supernovae , active galactic nuclei and other objects of special interest )",
    ".    unpredictable variations of brightness of these objects make it extremely difficult to check observations as automatically done for pulsating variables .",
    "together with faintness of these objects ( which implies existence of large number of negative observations ) , cross checks between different observers are indispensable .",
    "the present program * circ * , referring to a list of more than 1000 objects containing their properties ( type of variability , normal range of variation , ephemerides of eclipses etc . ) , checks all observations using databases .",
    "the list is updated by the editor whenever new information becomes available in order to maintain circulars up - to - date .",
    "the results are then listed as a file in the prototypical form of cv circulars , containing the reports of potentially discordant data ( or rapid intrinsic changes ) with special marks .",
    "the present version can handle more than tens of thousands of observations per month , and produces a circular in a minute .",
    "the same program , slightly modified to produce long - term averages , is used to produce vsnet mira circulars _ vsnet - miracirc_.http://www.kusastro.kyoto - u.ac.jp / vsnet / mail / vsnet - miracirc / maillist.html@xmath2 . ]",
    "when identifying variable stars and locating the ccd field of view , chart - plotting and star identification programs are very useful , particularly when the network resource was unavailable . for this purpose , one of the authors ( tk ) developed in 1990 a chart - plotting computer program , when machine - readable guide star catalog ( gsc ) 1.0 @xcite was released .",
    "the program was designed to run on a stand - alone personal computer running on ms - dos@xmath7 non - extended ( less than 640 kb ) memory .",
    "since the distribution form of gsc 1.0 was composed of huge ascii tables on two cd - roms ( 1.2 gb ) , and since the objects were randomly arranged within individual files covering 23 degrees square , it was an absolute requirement to compress these data and make them quickly and randomly accessible . in this software , we subdivided the entire gsc data into 0.5 degree bins in declination , and sorted the objects within the same bin according to right ascension . in order to compress the data , we used binary files which can be directly mapped in c structure . in order to avoid redundancy in right ascensions and enable quick random access",
    ", we used a separate jump table which records the file positions of given coordinate meshes .",
    "individual entries in the 0.5-deg bins only contain residuals to the mesh coordinates . in original compression of gsc 1.0 , each catalog entry corresponded to 5 bytes . by combining the information of coordinate mesh in the jump table and the individual entries ,",
    "one can obtain the fully decoded coordinates .",
    "these functions ( including sequential reading functions of a given box ) were implemented as transparent apis , many of which were designed to take a pointer to the display function as a call - back function . with this compression",
    ", the entire gsc 1.0 ( disregarding the object names , plate numbers ) can be compressed into 100 mb .",
    "this program was one of the earliest chart - plotting software packages that used gsc as source catalogs and implement encoded compressed catalogs , and the design was taken over in various successive third - party applications .",
    "the program is also able to display gcvs and nsv variable star catalogs , and iras psc objects , which were compressed in a similar manner employed in gsc compression .",
    "the program was later updated to accommodate gsc 1.1 @xcite and usno a1.0 @xcite catalogs in 1998 , and other catalogs ( with variable - length object labels ) . with the increase of capacity of storage media , the present version uses 12 bytes for one gsc 1.1 full entry and 8 bytes for one usno a1.0 entry . with this compression method ,",
    "the entire usno a1.0 data ( more than 4.8@xmath5510@xmath56 objects ) can be stored in 4 gb storage and can be quickly and randomly accessed .",
    "the present version is equipped with a function to handle the 2mass point source catalog in the same manner .",
    "the program also handles a name resolver by using the same database engine described in appendix [ sec : app : database ] .",
    "the entire program is presently ported to windows@xmath7 and linux using _ xlib _ graphic library ( see figure [ fig : v4743 ] for an example ) . with this program and apis",
