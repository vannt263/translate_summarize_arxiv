    "<S> it is apparent that nonlinearities in some theory would have to play a role . </S>",
    "<S> but if we take the ultraviolet scale to be the planck scale then einstein s theory , although nonlinear , is inadequate to approach this question . </S>",
    "<S> we should at least consider a derivative expansion of some underlying theory of gravity , in which the einstein action is simply the two derivative term . </S>",

    "<S> the _ period _ of a long time - scale oscillation is inversely related to the _ amplitude _ of a planck time - scale oscillation , and both of these quantities are determined by the size of the cosmological constant .    </S>",

    "<S> the only small dimensionless parameter is taken to be @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the spatially flat metric , @xmath7 along with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the two gravitational field equations together imply the scalar field equation , @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> an equation for @xmath10 alone can be obtained . each term in this equation , besides the cosmological constant term , will have an even number of derivatives acting on some number of @xmath10 s , where each @xmath10 has at least one derivative . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinearity in the equation is essential for the solutions we study , but for @xmath11 it will turn out that all derivatives of @xmath10 are of order @xmath12 times the appropriate power of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus our solutions are hardly affected if we drop terms higher order than quadratic in @xmath10 in the equations .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition we shall begin by dropping terms higher order than @xmath13 in ( [ aa ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this truncation is not in any way justified , and in fact a problem will arise from this truncation . </S>",
    "<S> but the truncated theory serves to illustrate the basic dynamics , and we shall later see how the effects of higher order terms can eliminate the problem . the truncated equation can be put in the following dimensionless form involving @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . in addition </S>",

    "<S> the massless scalar contribution to the energy - momentum tensor corresponds to an equation of state @xmath22 with @xmath23 ; for a more general contribution we find @xmath24 we shall examine solutions of ( [ bb ] ) and treat ( [ ff ] ) and ( [ hh ] ) as special cases .    </S>",
    "<S> the de sitter expansion @xmath25 is clearly a solution to ( [ bb ] ) when @xmath26 . </S>",

    "<S> solutions with properties similar to these occur for a range of the initial conditions.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the two scales of periodicity can be separated arbitrarily far since @xmath21 can be arbitrarily small . </S>",
    "<S> for example if @xmath40 is a major component driving the present evolution of the universe , then the period of the slow oscillation can be of order the age of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> given that the solution also requires a fast oscillation of order the planck time , it is appropriate to refer to these solutions as uv - ir coupled .    </S>",

    "<S> 2 ) when @xmath21 is not very small then the frequency of the two oscillations become similar , and some tuning of the initial conditions becomes necessary .    </S>",
    "<S> thus far we have considered an equation with up to 4-derivatives only . as we have alluded to above </S>",
    "<S> there is a problem with the uv - ir coupled solutions in this truncated theory . </S>",
    "<S> the other gravitational field equation determines an oscillating @xmath41 that automatically satisfies the scalar field equation , but it also implies that @xmath41 is negative definite . </S>",
    "<S> is also negative while asymptotically vanishing , but there is a different range of initial conditions that can produce positive @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> a change in initial conditions can not produce positive @xmath41 for the uv - ir coupled solutions to ( [ bb ] ) . ] </S>",
    "<S> this result is connected with having @xmath30 , since the contributions to the pressure @xmath42 from @xmath40 and the average @xmath43 tend to cancel . since @xmath41 contributes to @xmath44 ( unlike @xmath40 ) this problem with the truncated theory could be avoided if there was some other negative contribution to @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> higher order derivative terms involving the scalar field can not help in this way since derivatives of @xmath41 are of order @xmath45 in planck units ( as can be seen from the scalar field equation ) , and @xmath41 itself is of order @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand all derivatives of @xmath47 are of order @xmath21 and thus contributions from higher powers of @xmath48 can completely change the picture . </S>",
    "<S> they will add new linear and nonlinear terms to ( [ bb ] ) of the same order in @xmath21 , respectively , as the ones in ( [ bb ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the following equation with six derivative terms , where in general there is one additional linear term and three more quadratic terms . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 for the two and four derivative terms we have inserted the values in ( [ ff ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for a range of coefficients of the new terms that uv - ir coupled solutions are once again generic , even when @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> the linear terms must support the fast oscillations ; that is , the equation for the frequency obtained by inserting a sinusoid into the linear terms must have real roots only . here </S>",
    "<S> it implies that @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> then to ensure that @xmath40 and @xmath41 are positive , the quadratic coefficients must be such that @xmath51 is sufficiently large and positive and @xmath52 is in some finite range that includes zero . </S>",
    "<S> it seems likely that these conditions can be satisfied for some range of the many coefficients that appear in the action with @xmath53 terms . </S>",
    "<S> but whatever the answer to that question , the question will have to be repeated for yet higher order terms . </S>",
    "<S> the answer can also be sensitive to the equation of state of other contributions to the energy momentum tensor . in the end a theory will either support the uv - ir coupled solutions or it will not ; fine tuning is not necessary .    ) with coefficients @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial conditions generating a and b have vanishing derivatives except for @xmath58 and 0.028 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> solutions exist for a range of the initial conditions , including the case where all derivatives in the initial conditions vanish.,title=\"fig : \" ] ) with coefficients @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial conditions generating a and b have vanishing derivatives except for @xmath58 and 0.028 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> solutions exist for a range of the initial conditions , including the case where all derivatives in the initial conditions vanish.,title=\"fig : \" ]    two examples of solutions to ( [ ee ] ) with @xmath28 are displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) , with the only difference being in the size of the initial conditions . for the larger initial derivatives , fig .  ( 2b ) </S>",
    "<S> shows that the rapid oscillations can become irregular . </S>",
    "<S> this is presumably related to the existence of multiple rapidly oscillating modes associated with the linear terms , unlike the case in ( [ bb ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we can at least address the meaning of the condition on the linear order terms at arbitrarily high order . </S>",
    "<S> the condition that the associated polynomial in the frequency has only real roots is just the requirement that there are no exponentially evolving modes among small fluctuations that retain the form of the metric in ( [ dd ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> when extended to all orders in the derivative expansion of some underlying theory , this is the statement that the underlying theory is stable within this family of metrics .    for a theory that supports the uv - ir coupled solutions with @xmath28 , there will also be the de sitter solution @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> but in this case the de sitter solution is unstable . </S>",
    "<S> numerical analysis shows that the fast oscillations will tend to grow from any perturbation of the various derivatives of @xmath47 to approach the order @xmath21 amplitude , and eventually the large scale expansion will turn into a large scale oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , unlike the situation in ( [ gg ] ) , the de sitter solution is not the generic solution . </S>",
    "<S> of course in a different theory it may be that the de sitter solution is generic , rather than the uv - ir coupled ones . </S>",
    "<S> for example in ( [ ee ] ) the de sitter solution is generic for @xmath52 sufficiently large and positive .    </S>",
    "<S> there is the related question of a possible decay @xcite of the fast oscillations to energetic particles , occurring through the gravitational coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we see that this would involve a competition between the decay and the tendency for the oscillations to grow . and </S>",
    "<S> since the metric is conformally flat the decay would require conformal symmetry breaking , for example in the form of a particle mass , implying suppressed couplings of the oscillations to matter .    </S>",
    "<S> a decay to a de sitter state would also assume that that is the preferred state . </S>",
    "<S> this is by no means obvious . </S>",
    "<S> given the role of nonlinearities in the equations , it seems more likely that a more generic state is preferred where the various derivatives of @xmath47 are all of the same order . </S>",
    "<S> thus there may well be some kind of decay to a ground state , but that ground state could be a particular uv - ir coupled solution .    </S>",
    "<S> all of this says nothing about the problem of why the cosmological constant is so small . </S>",
    "<S> this question becomes more interesting in some context in which the cosmological constant is a derived quantity . </S>",
    "<S> this may occur in higher dimensional theories @xcite , and in particular in a singularity - free warped kaluza - klein picture @xcite where the effective 4d cosmological constant is a function of the amount of warping . </S>",
    "<S> in fact there are solutions @xcite where time dependent oscillations coexist with the warping of a fifth dimension ; and in this case the equations of the @xmath59 action yield @xmath60 . but </S>",
    "<S> solutions having an exponential expansion as well were not found . </S>",
    "<S> this is understandable in light of the present results which indicate that the generic solutions are oscillatory on large time scales as well as short time scales . to actually demonstrate uv - ir coupled solutions within </S>",
    "<S> the warped kaluza - klein framework would require solving nontrivially coupled high - order differential equations .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , uv - ir coupled solutions may well exist in such a framework . </S>",
    "<S> if such a solution is preferred for a given effective 4d cosmological constant , then the oscillation and its coupling to normal matter may provide a mechanism for the decay of the effective 4d cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> note that the metric would have to adjust on both large and small time scales , since the relaxation would proceed through a series of uv - ir coupled solutions as @xmath21 decreased . </S>"
