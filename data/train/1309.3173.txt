    "polar codes are capacity - achieving codes for the class of binary - input discrete memoryless channels ( b - dmcs)@xcite . in @xcite , successive cancellation ( sc )",
    "decoding is used to recover information bits . later in @xcite , belief propagation ( bp ) decoding",
    "is employed to achieve better performance in becs , but in general b - dmcs the specific schedule of the individual messages for bp decoding is a problem .",
    "linear programming ( lp ) decoding is introduced afterwards without any schedule , but it does not work for other channels except becs @xcite . recently , list successive cancellation ( lsc ) decoding of polar codes is developed and shows significant performance improvement compared with sc decoding .",
    "however , much higher decoding complexity is observed for lsc @xcite @xcite .",
    "thus , to find a decoding algorithm with both good frame error rate ( fer ) performance and low complexity is an open interest . in this paper , we propose a low complexity list successive cancellation ( lclsc ) decoding algorithm to significantly reduce the complexity of lsc decoding while trying to maintain its fer performance .",
    "in @xcite , polar codes are introduced to achieve the capacity of b - dmcs by exploiting the channel polarization effect . for an @xmath0 polar code of @xmath1 information bits and @xmath2 encoded bits ( @xmath3 ) ,",
    "an invertible matrix @xmath4 is introduced to describe channel polarization . here",
    ", @xmath5 is a @xmath6 matrix where @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath8 denotes the kronecker product .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the vector of input bits and encoded bits correspondingly , while @xmath11 denotes the vector of channel output .",
    "for the vector channel of copies of a given b - dmc @xmath12 , the transition probability @xmath13 between @xmath14 and @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 and the subchannel @xmath17 with input @xmath18 and output @xmath19 has the transition probability @xmath20    the polar encoding scheme is to transmit the set @xmath21 of @xmath1 information bits @xmath22 over @xmath1 most reliable subchannels out of @xmath2 subchannels and to use the other ones to transmit the so called  frozen \" bits . note that @xmath23 is labeled with respect of the sequence that information bits are decoded , i.e. @xmath24 is the first decoded information bit while @xmath25 is the last decoded information bit .",
    "this labelling is also used in @xmath26 and @xmath27 which will be introduced later . in @xcite ,",
    "sc decoding is used to recover information bits @xmath28 , where the estimation of information bits @xmath29 , are successively generated by computing the likelihood ratios ( lrs ) @xmath30 : @xmath31    lsc decoding is the extension of sc decoding , which is actually a breadth - first searching on the code tree with searching width @xmath32 .",
    "lsc decoding keeps a list of size @xmath32 and updates the list after each @xmath33 , is obtained .",
    "it is well known that the complexity of lsc decoding is @xmath34 with the so called  lazy copy \" strategy , which is @xmath32 times of the complexity of sc decoding @xcite @xcite . for more about lsc decoding",
    ", we refer readers to @xcite @xcite .",
    "lsc decoding with large list size @xmath32 performs significantly better than sc decoding , but its complexity is also much higher , which is a deficiency in practical implementation . in this paper , we are interested in finding a low complexity decoding algorithm that can greatly reduce the complexity of lsc decoding while trying to maintain the fer performance of lsc decoding at the same time .    for convenience ,",
    "we give the definition below before introducing our proposed algorithm .    based on channel polarization , a subchannel @xmath35 transmitting information bit @xmath18",
    "is called a  good \" subchannel if and only if its bhattacharyya parameter @xmath36 and all the bhattacharyya parameters of its subsequential decoded information bits @xmath37 are smaller than a threshold ( i.e. the bhattacharyya parameter threshold will be discussed later ) .",
    "otherwise , the subchannel is called a  bad \" one .",
    "then we introduce two parameters of the proposed decoding algorithm .",
    "one is called  lr threshold \" @xmath38 , which determines whether an information bit is received reliably or not .",
    "this parameter is used to decide whether to process sc decoding or lsc decoding over @xmath18 based on the observation of @xmath30 .",
    "the other parameter is the ",
    "bhattacharyya parameter threshold \" @xmath39 . based on the channel polarization effect ,",
    "the set of information bits @xmath21 can be divided into two subsets , namely @xmath40 , which stands for the set of information bits that are transmitted over  bad \" subchannels thus are more probable to contribute to fer , and @xmath41 , which stands for the set of information bits that are all transmitted over  good \" subchannels thus are more reliable , given correctly estimated @xmath42 .",
    "the bhattacharyya parameter threshold @xmath39 is used to decide the number of information bits transmitted over  bad \" subchannels , which is denoted by @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "the motivation of the proposed decoding algorithm is to reduce the lsc decoding complexity .",
    "we achieve this by two folds . for each information",
    "bit , when its estimation is reliable , we process sc decoding rather than lsc decoding .",
    "secondly , when all information bits from  bad \" subchannels are received reliably , we process sc decoding instead of lsc decoding for information bits from  good \" subchannels as well .",
    "now we briefly describe the proposed lclsc decoding , which is shown as algorithm 1 . after starting the decoding process",
    ", we observe the lrs of information bits in @xmath26 bit by bit .",
    "if the observed lr of @xmath45 is larger than the lr threshold @xmath38 , sc decoding is processed over @xmath18 . if @xmath30 is greater than @xmath38 for all information bits of subset @xmath26 ( i.e. @xmath46 ) , we process sc decoding for the rest of information bits @xmath47 . on the other hand , if @xmath30 is less than the lr threshold @xmath38 for any @xmath48 , we process lsc decoding for this information bit and the remaining information bits @xmath49 in @xmath21 .    @xmath50 the number of information bits in @xmath26 @xmath51    process sc decoding over @xmath18 @xmath52++ process lsc decoding over @xmath18 break    // _",
    "this means sc decoding is not applicable after lsc decoding is processed . _",
    "process sc decoding for the remaining bits process lsc decoding for the remaining bits    it is clear that in the proposed decoding algorithm , we have two thresholds to determine .",
    "one is the lr threshold @xmath38 , the other is the bhattacharyya parameter threshold @xmath39 .",
    "we discuss these two thresholds in the following sections .",
    "as discussed above , if the lr of any information bit @xmath53 at the receiver is sufficiently high , i.e. larger than the lr threshold @xmath38 , each of the information bit over  bad \" subchannels is received reliably .",
    "then we only need to process sc decoding instead of lsc decoding since the received signal is more likely to be decoded correctly . for the purpose of determining @xmath38",
    ", we introduce the proposition below .    in a b - dmc with bhattacharyya parameter @xmath54",
    ", the upper bound of the bit error probability @xmath55 in estimating the channel input on the basis of the channel output via the maximun - likehood ( ml ) decoding is given as follows @xcite @xmath56    based on proposition 1 , it can be concluded that the lower bound of the probability that the input bit @xmath18 is correctly estimated is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes the bhattacharyya parameter of the subchannel where @xmath18 is transmitted .    for an input bit",
    "@xmath59 , if the probability of determining @xmath18 as 0 or 1 is smaller than @xmath57 , we regard @xmath60 is not reliable and need to process lsc decoding over @xmath18 . on the other hand , if the probability of determining @xmath18 as 0 or 1 is larger than @xmath57 , we consider the estimation @xmath61 is reliable and thus employ sc decoding",
    ". therefore , we derive the inequalities which are satisfied when the estimation @xmath60 is reliable @xmath62 and @xmath63 which represents the lower bound of correct decoding probability for information bit @xmath18 .    when either of the inequalities in ( [ widehatp ] ) is satisfied , we process sc decoding instead of lsc decoding over @xmath18 .",
    "thus , @xmath38 is defined as    @xmath64    which means when the observed lr is larger than 1 , we process sc decoding instead of lsc decoding if the observed lr is larger than @xmath65 .",
    "when the observed lr is smaller than 1 , we do the same if the observed lr is smaller than @xmath66 .",
    "in this section the bhattacharyya parameter threshold @xmath67 that determines @xmath43 is derived .",
    "we look deeper and exploit the reliability of good polarized subchannels . in consistent with",
    "[ 1 ] , the bhattacharyya parameter is utilized to measure the reliability of subchannels . based on definition 1 ,",
    "@xmath67 can be expressed as : @xmath68 since the bit error events in sc decoding are not independent , the fer lower bound of the ml decoding @xmath69 is derived according to proposition 1 @xmath70    in [ 1 ] , @xmath71 serves as the fer upper bound of the sc decoding @xmath72 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath73    it is noted that @xmath71 consists of the bhattacharyya parameters of @xmath1 different subchannels transmitting information bits .",
    "some of them are quite small leading to reliable subchannels , others are large resulting in unreliable subchannels . as fer mainly results from subchannels with larger @xmath74 , we could determine the bhattacharyya parameter threshold as the one that can approach the fer lower bound of ml decoding : @xmath75 which can be explained as follows .",
    "we consider a subchannel @xmath76 where @xmath18 is transmitted .",
    "if @xmath74 is larger than @xmath39 , then we have @xmath77 larger than the fer lower bound of ml decoding .",
    "thus we consider the subchannel @xmath76 less reliable .",
    "therefore , to achieve a good fer performance , we should observe whether the estimation @xmath61 satisfies @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath30 is satisfied , we regard @xmath18 is reliably recovered . otherwise , we should process lsc decoding over @xmath18 to approach the fer performance of ml decoding ( note lsc decoding becomes ml decoding when @xmath78 , and practically the performance of lsc decoding is very close to ml decoding with moderate @xmath32 ) . if @xmath74 is less than @xmath39 , we have @xmath79 lower than the fer lower bound of @xmath69 . therefore , @xmath76 is considered a more reliable subchannel and then the sc decoding is likely to provide correct estimation of the information bit , if the lr thresholds of @xmath80 are all satisfied .",
    "as mentioned above , the information bits in @xmath47 all have a bhattacharyya parameter smaller than @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to process sc decoding over @xmath47 to approach the fer of ml decoding if the estimation of @xmath80 is reliable .",
    "based on the discussion above , the bhattacharyya parameter threshold @xmath39 is determined as @xmath81 and @xmath43 can be obtained according to ( [ z_th ] ) , as @xmath82 is the first  good \" subchannel in the decoding process .",
    "in this section we first analyze the complexity of the lclsc decoding . note in the lclsc decoding , the sc decoding is processed over some ( or all ) information bits while the lsc decoding is processed over the rest ones .",
    "denote @xmath83 as the average number of information bits over which we process sc decoding and thus @xmath84 is the average number of information bits over which the lsc decoding is processed .",
    "in consistent with @xcite , the computational model for complexity analysis is a single processor machine with random - access memory , and the complexities expressed are time complexities . for the decoding algorithms , the time complexities",
    "are measured with the total number of lr calculations .",
    "note that the time complexity of sc and lsc decoding is @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively , meaning the number of lr calculations is @xmath87 and @xmath88 correspondingly @xcite .",
    "then the average number of lr calculations of our proposed lclsc decoding algorithm is given by @xmath89    when implementing the lclsc decoding algorithm , there may be the case that all the information bits are recovered with sc decoding and there may also be the case that some information bits are recovered with sc while others with lsc decoding .",
    "so the complexity in ( 12 ) is actually an averaged complexity .",
    "also , the complexity of lclsc decoding in the figures below are all averaged over the simulation .",
    "it is straightforward that @xmath90 is less than @xmath88 , thus the proposed lclsc decoding has a lower decoding complexity than lsc decoding , which will be shown in the following .",
    "the saving in decoding complexity is considerable for low code rates .",
    "now , we present simulation results of a polar code with length 512 and different code rates .",
    "the results for the bec with erasure rate @xmath91 , the bsc with cross probability 0.11 and the bawgnc with the standard deviation of gaussian noise @xmath92 are depicted .",
    "figs 1 , 2 and 3 show the fer performance of the sc , lsc and lclsc decoding on various channels .",
    "the capacity for both the bsc and the bawgnc is 0.5 and the codes for bsc and bawgnc are those optimzed via arikan s heuristic method [ 2 ] . in the lclsc decoding ,",
    "the lr threshold is determined by the correct decoding probability for each information bit @xmath93 , as discussed above . in the results of the bec",
    ", we set @xmath93 in two different ways : ( i ) set @xmath93 to be its lower bound @xmath57 , as ( 5 ) , and ( ii ) set @xmath93 to be a fixed value 0.9 .",
    "as the polarization indices are not known in closed form for the bsc and the bawgnc , @xmath93 is therefore set to 0.9 in those channels .",
    "list size @xmath32 is set to 16 in both the lsc and lclsc decoding .    from figs 1 , 2 and 3",
    "we can see that the lclsc decoding has almost the same fer performance as lsc decoding and much better fer performance than sc decoding .",
    "figs 4 , 5 and 6 show the corresponding complexity of the three decoding algorithms on various channels .",
    "it is illustrated that the lclsc decoding has a lower complexity than the lsc decoding .",
    "the complexity reduction is larger with lower code rate , as there are more ",
    "reliable \" subchannels where we could process sc decoding instead of lsc decoding .",
    "especially , in low to medium code rates , the complexity of lclsc decoding is near to that of sc decoding with slightly degraded fer performance compared with lsc decoding .",

    "in this paper , an lclsc decoding algorithm that can reduce the complexity of lsc decoding was proposed .",
    "we set an lr threshold and a bhattacharyya parameter threshold to determine the information bits over which sc decoding instead of lsc decoding could be utilized .",
    "simulation results showed that the proposed decoding algorithm could reduce the decoding complexity of lsc decoding significantly with low code rate while almost maintaining the same fer performance .",
