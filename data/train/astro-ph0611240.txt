    "the wt mode data were divided into 21 bins with 1000 source photons in each bin . because of the high count rate at the beginning of the observations we applied the method as described in @xcite to avoid the effects of pileup .",
    "however , this procedure reduced significantly the number of source photons in each single spectrum .",
    "we , therefore , combined two bins into one for bins 1 + 2 , 3 + 4 , 5 + 6 , 7 + 8 , and 9 + 10 to increase the signal to noise ratio .",
    "each of the 16 spectra were fitted by an absorbed single power law , blackbody plus power law , and a power law with exponential cutoff model .",

    "the hardness ratio changes from hr=0.6 at the beginning of the observation to hr=@xmath590.56 at the end , indicating a dramatic evolution in the x - ray spectrum within 2 minutes of observing time which translates into 1.3 minutes in the rest frame .",
    "while the spectra during the first 20 s of the wt mode observation are well - fitted by a single power law model , after about 150s after the burst the data are better fit by a blackbody plus power law spectrum .",
    "for the absorbed power law fits , all parameters were left free .",
    "we found that while the spectra at the beginning of the observation were rather hard with @xmath5=1.5 and @xmath60=@xmath61 @xmath7 , the spectra became very soft with @xmath5@xmath623.0 and @xmath60=@xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "note that the absorption column density @xmath60  decreases while the energy spectral index @xmath5  becomes steeper - the opposite than what is expected if the spectral slope and the absorption column density were just linked in the fitting program .",
    "however , note that especially during the later bins , the spectra are not well fit by a single power law and do require more complicated models .    for the blackbody plus power law model ,",

    "( see the discussion about the  spectral analysis ) results in similar values for the temperature .",
    "the only differences are that the temperatures tend to be lower by 40 ev and the normalizations are higher .    the prompt emission of grbs is often fitted by a band function @xcite .",
    "we also tried a power law model with exponential cutoff , which is a surrogate for the band model , which has the advantage of using fewer parameters than the band model . in order to obtain better constraints we fixed the absorption column to the galactic value .",

    "therefore , we will only discuss the absorbed power law model fits as listed in table[xmm_xrt_xspec ] .",
    "the obvious difference between the  xrt and  pn and mos data is the much higher value of the absorption column density . from the free fit absorption column density at z=0 we measured an absorption column density @xmath60=15.7@xmath63 @xmath7 in the  xrt data .",

    "we also applied the _ gain fit _",
    "model within _ xspec _ , but it did not remove the discrepancy . this discrepancy maybe due to problems with the  xrt bias maps during the time period 2006 july 21 and 2006 august 3 .",
    "this bias map problem causes an offset in the gain and therefore compromises the spectral analysis of  xrt pc mode data during that time period .",

    "as we will show later in section[sed ] the absorption column density of @xmath68 @xmath7 is in good agreement to what can be derived from the spectral energy distribution of the afterglow .",

    "the first uvot white points show a decay similar to the xrt wt light curve . however after these few points the uvot white light curve flattens , which agrees with the flare seen in the xrt data at 170s after the burst . at about 200s after the burst the afterglow starts to become brighter in the uvot white , while it is still decaying in x - rays .",
    "the right panel of figure[grb060729_xrt_uvot_early ] shows the uvot v event mode data and the xrt pc mode data of the first orbit .",
    "the uvot v data were grouped in 25 s bins and the xrt pc mode data with 25 source photons per bin .",
    "the uvot v light curve shows the afterglow fairly constant at about 17.5 mag while the xrt pc mode light curves shows an initial decay until about 600s and flattens after that .",
    "the  optical monitor observations are summarized in table[om_data ] . while the u filter results agree well with the uvot u data as listed in table[uvot_lc ] , there is a discrepancy in the uvw1 and uvm2 filters .",
    "there maybe two explanations for this discrepancy : 1 ) the om and uvot uv filter sets have different filter transmission , 2 ) om suffers from significantly higher level of scattered light than the uvot , and third the extraction radius of the automated om software is 12@xmath21 which is too large for an accurate analysis of the uv data due to the bright star ( see uvot section ) .",
    "the brightening of the afterglow in the last om uvm2 observation at 101 ks after the burst is most likely due to a bad subtraction of the background within the automatic om data reduction software .      as shown in section[uvot_analysis ] the long - term light curves in all 6 uvot filters and in x - rays do follow the same decay slope with similar break times at about 50 ks after the burst . in order to check this we determined spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the afterglow at 800s , 20 ks , 100 ks , and 500 ks , * with exposure times in the xrt of 400s , 1.8 ks , 3.3 ks , and 4.8 ks , respectively .",
    "* figure[grb060729_sed ] displays these four seds .",
    "these times are also marked in figure[grb060729_xrt_uvot_lc ] .",
    "these times were picked to represent the seds of the earliest and latest time possible when the afterglow was detected in all 6 uvot filters and shortly before and after the break .",
    "all fluxes in all 6 uvot filters and the xrt were calculated according to the light curves .",
    "there seem to be no obvious changes in the seds , besides the changes in the fluxes , over time .",
    "another measure of any changes in the seds over time is the optical / uv to x - ray spectral slope or x - ray loudness=0.384 log(@xmath73 ) . ]",
    "for the afterglow of grb060729 we measured rest - frame @xmath74  of 0.85@xmath20.10 at 800s , 0.84@xmath20.05 at 20 ks , 0.74@xmath20.07 at 100 ks , and 0.77@xmath20.10 at 500 ks after the burst . within the errors these values are consistent and do not suggest any changes between the optical / uv and x - ray parts of the sed over time after the first orbit .",
    "however , note that during the first @xmath75400s of data the sed changes dramatically , because the x - ray flux decays very fast ( @xmath76=5.1 while the white and v data suggest that the optical afterglow is constant .",
    "a single power law spectrum between optical / uv and x - ray energies a @xmath74=1.1 is expected according to the fits to the x - ray data ( table[xmm_xrt_xspec ] ) .",
    "this assumption of a single power law spectrum between the optical and x - rays is justified given that the optical has the same temporal behavior as the x - rays and that the optical and x - rays are both above the cooling frequency .",
    "the difference between the expected @xmath74=1.1 and the measured @xmath74@xmath750.8 values suggests intrinsic reddening at the location of the afterglow .",
    "based on the absorption corrected rest - frame 2 kev flux density we can calculate the expected flux density at rest - frame 2500 .",
    "we calculated a reddening of 1.7 mag at rest - frame 2500  which corresponds to an @xmath30=0.34 mag . applying the relation given by @xcite @xmath7 .",
    "] we calculated an intrinsic column density @xmath77 @xmath7 .",
    "considering that this is a rough estimate , this absorption column density agrees quite well with that measured from the  epic pn spectrum , @xmath78 @xmath7 ( table[xmm_xrt_xspec ] ) .",
    "the afterglow of grb060729 has been detected in x - rays by the -xrt longer than any other -detected burst , up to 125 days after the burst .",
    "finally by the end of december we had to give up on observing this burst by   because it became too faint to be detectable anymore in the xrt detector .",
    "even though the afterglow was dropped from the  observing schedule after 2006 december 27 , we are still planning to obtain more observations with larger observatories such as , , and _",
    "suzaku_.      the x - ray and uv / optical light curves are remarkably similar . not only that their decay slopes and break times are in good agreement ( except for the b light curve ) , but they also seem to be synchronized during rebrightening phases , which can be seen best in the uvw2 light curve .",
    "in particular the re - brightening at about 15 ks after the burst clearly appears to be present in all 6 uvot filters and in x - rays . even though the break at around 50 ks after the burst seems to be achromatic , we do not consider this to be a jet break .",
    "the post - break decay slope @xmath79=1.29 is to shallow to be a jet break .",
    "if we interpret this slope as the post jet break slope , we would get @xmath80 , which is much flatter than the electron distribution index predicted by shock acceleration theory ( usually @xmath81 ) .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath80 , one would expect the spectral slope @xmath82 or @xmath83 for a cooling frequency below or above the x - ray range respectively , which are obviously contrary to the observed spectral slope of @xmath5=1.1 most likely we have not seen the jet break in the afterglow of grb 060729 because the afterglow has not been followed long enough as the studies by @xcite suggest .",
    "one of our main results is that the light curve of the afterglow does not yet show a jet break at 125 days after the burst ( 81 days in the rest frame ) .",
    "this is the longest period a grb afterglow was ever followed and detected in x - rays , except for grb 030329 which was followed 258 days after the burst by  @xcite . according to the relation given in @xcite",
    "we would have expected to see a jet break at about 5.5@xmath84 s after the burst . with an isotropic energy in the rest - frame 1 kev-10 mev @xmath85 ergs and the relations given by @xcite and @xcite , and the non - detection of a jet break up to 125 days after the burst",
    ", we derive that the opening angle of the jet has to be larger than 28@xmath3 , assuming a particle density @xmath86@xmath87 and an efficiency @xmath88=0.2 . with @xmath5=1.0 and @xmath89=1.29 according to table 2 in @xcite we estimated an electron index slope p=2.3 for the ism or wind case with @xmath90 .",
    "the afterglow of grb060729 is not only remarkable for its long follow - up observations in x - rays but also for its relatively late break time between the flat decay phase and the steepening phase ( phases 2 and 3 according to * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at about 53 ks after the burst , which converts to 35 ks in the rest frame .",
    "typically the break between phases 2 and 3 occurs around 10 ks after the burst @xcite",
    ". the late time break at 35 ks after the burst ( rest frame ) requires a substantial ongoing injection of energy into the afterglow . in a matter of fact , when we observed this afterglow with swift e at first did not detect a break in the light curve until about 2 days after the burst due to the lumpiness of this plateau phase .",
    "also note that @xcite list the break time in the x - ray light curve at 120 ks after the burst .",
    "the relatively long time of this very flat decay ( @xmath91 ) phase implies larger energy injection during the early time in this burst than in other bursts",
    ". this energy injection could be the result of a refreshed shock @xcite or continuous energy input from the central engine .",
    "assume the energy injection has the form @xmath92 , the light curve decay rate is @xmath93 for @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "so we get @xmath95 , and the total energy is increased by a factor of @xmath96 during this energy injection phase , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the first and second break time of the x - ray light curve respectively .",
    "such a large energy increase factor is the highest among the -detected grbs @xcite .",
    "this may be part of the reason that we see a bright x - ray afterglow for a very long time , besides that no jet break occurs before 125 days after the burst .",
    "the plateau phase of the x - ray afterglow of grb060729 is one of the longest ever observed by .",
    "the total fluence in the 0.3 - 10.0 kev band of this plateau is about 1@xmath43 ergs @xmath7 , which is about 1/3 of the total 15 - 150 kev fluence of the prompt emission .",
    "the @xmath99 value ( @xmath100 ) inferred for this burst implies a pulsar type ( i.e. magnetic dipole radiation ) energy injection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    using the x - ray luminosity @xmath101ergs s@xmath17 at @xmath102 , we estimate the isotropic kinetic energy at this time is @xmath103 @xcite , where @xmath104 is the equipartition factor of electrons in afterglow shocks . assuming the energy increasing factor 100 during the flat decay phase , the isotropic kinetic energy before the energy injection phase is only @xmath105 , implying a high efficiency of gamma - ray production during the prompt phase . using the isotropic kinetic energy and the jet break time larger than 125 days after the burst",
    ", we get the jet opening angle larger than @xmath106 @xcite , where @xmath107 is the number density of the circumburst ism . from this",
    ", we further get the beam - corrected kinetic energy of the burst @xmath108 .",
    "such a larger kinetic energy than those in usual bursts may be a direct consequence of the unusually long energy injection phase in the early time .",
    "even though the x - ray and uv / optical afterglow of grb 060729 was unusually bright , it was rather unspectacular in the bat 15 - 150 kev energy range .",
    "the 15 - 150 kev fluence of 2.7@xmath43 ergs @xmath7 @xcite is rather moderate compared to other -discovered bursts .",
    "also note , that the peak luminosity of grb 060729 of about 3@xmath109 ergs s@xmath17 is very low for a long burst regarding the time lag between the 50 - 100 kev and 15 - 25 kev band as shown by @xcite .",
    "the observations of the x - ray and uv fields of grb 060729 have been the deepest ever performed by . in x - rays",
    "we observed the field for 1.13 ms and for 550 ks each in uvw1 and uvw2 .",
    "the uvw1 and uvw2 observations are the longest exposure that were taken of any field in the uv by any uv observatory .",
    "the results of this study and the source identifications based on their spectral energy distributions will be presented in a separate paper which is in preparation .      during the xrt wt mode epoch of observations ,",
    "two flares are detected .",
    "for the first x - ray flare , only the decay part is seen by the xrt .",
    "the decay rates after the peak of the flares are as steep as @xmath110 , pointing to internal central engine activity as the origin for the x - ray flares @xcite .    during 130 - 160",
    "s ( time bins from 1 to 11 in table[wt_xspec ] ) and 190 - 300 s , the x - ray emission is undergoing a steep decay , which may result from the high - latitude emission of the corresponding flares @xcite , i.e. we see the curvature effect of the radiation pulse . in this picture , the count rate and the peak energy ( @xmath64 or @xmath47 ) both decrease as the pulse decays .",
    "this is because less and less doppler - boosted radiation is seen from the pulse .",
    "this accounts for the strong correlation between the count rate and the blackbody temperature @xmath64 ( spearman rank order correlation coefficient @xmath111=0.96 with @xmath112=11.8 and a probability of p@xmath113 of a random distribution ; linear correlation coefficient @xmath114=0.95 ) .",
    "the wt data of the early afterglow observations showed a dramatic change in the x - ray spectrum within less than two minutes in the rest frame .",
    "typically the spectra of the bins of the wt mode data can be fitted by a single absorbed power law or a black body plus power law model .",
    "the power law model shows that there is a decrease in the absorption column density by a factor of 4 from the beginning of the observation at 131 s after the burst to 300s after the burst .",
    "such decreases in the absorption column density have been observed before in grb afterglows , like e.g. in grb 050712 @xcite , but have been usually linked to a flattening of the x - ray spectral slope .",
    "this is typically an artifact of the spectral fitting routine , that may be due to the correlation between spectral parameters such as @xmath60  and @xmath5 .",
    "however , the situation in grb060729 is completely different .",
    "here we observe not only a decreasing absorption column density @xmath57 , but also a steepening of the x - ray spectral slope @xmath5 , which is the opposite of what one expects if this is just an artifact of the fitting routine .",
    "therefore we consider the decrease of the absorption column density to be real .",
    "there are two explanations for a decrease in the column density of a neutral absorber : 1 ) an expanding medium which results in a lower volume and column density and 2 ) ionization of the neutral gas .",
    "both , the expansion and the ionization of the gas , happen after the explosion of the star .",
    "a softening of the x - ray spectrum during the initial decline has been commonly observed as reported by @xcite .",
    "alternatively the wt mode spectra can also be fitted with a black body plus power law model . in order to limit the number of free parameters the absorption column density parameter",
    "was set to the galactic value .",
    "these fits show a decrease of the black body temperature from about 0.6 kev to about 0.1 kev from the beginning to the end of the wt observing period .",
    "fixing the absorption column density to a value of @xmath6 @xmath7 , the value obtained at later times during the xmm observation , results in similar values for the blackbody temperature . from these",
    "fits the temperature tends to be slightly lower than when fixing the @xmath57 to the galactic value .",
    "however , within the errors the results are consistent .",
    "the biggest influence the increase in the absorption column density has is on the normalization of the blackbody and power law components .    in the latter scenario ,",
    "the thermal component is likely to be the photospheric emission from x - ray flares . in the prompt grb phase ,",
    "we have seen the thermal emission from some bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has been interpreted as the photospheric emission when the fireball becomes optically - thin @xcite .",
    "since x - ray flares are believed to be the result of late - time central engine activity with radiation mechanism similar to the prompt phase , a photosphere component found in x - ray flares is reasonable .",
    "the thermal emission component discovered from grb060729 also supports the internal origin of the x - ray flares , rather than external shocks .",
    "let us examine the relation between the black body radius @xmath115 derived from the spectral fitting and the photosphere radius @xmath116 .",
    "for a relativistic moving source , the luminosity of the thermal component at the photospheric radius is @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the photospheric temperature in the co - moving frame and @xmath119 is the bulk lorentz factor .",
    "as the usual fitting uses @xmath120 , we get @xmath121 by taking advantage of @xmath122 .",
    "the fitted black body radii around the peak of the x - ray flares are a few times @xmath123 .",
    "this means the photospheric radii of the two x - ray flares in grb060729 are a few times of @xmath124 .",
    "the photospheric radius is very sensitive to the bulk lorentz factor @xmath119 of the fireball @xcite and a photospheric radius of @xmath125 is reasonable if @xmath119 of the x - ray flare is of the order of ten .    during the early steep decay phase , the bolometric flux ( equivalent to the flux in xrt band if the peak energy located within the 0.3 - 10 kev range of the xrt ) may decrease as @xmath126 due to the curvature effect ( ryde & petrosian 2002 ) , where @xmath12 is some reference time of the flare ( liang et al . 2006 ) , and the peak energy decays as @xmath127 .",
    "so if we fit the spectrum with the black body model ( @xmath128 ) all the time during the decay phase , we would expect that the black body radius increases with time as @xmath129 .",
    "this may explain the apparent increase of the black body radius with time during the steep phase of the flares .",
    "we studied the  and  observations of the afterglow of grb060729 and found :    * the light curve of the afterglow extends out to 125 days after the burst ( 81 days in the rest - frame ) without showing any sign of a jet break .",
    "we estimated that the jet opening angle has to be larger than @xmath130 .",
    "this is the longest followup and detection of a grb afterglow in x - rays ever performed , except for grb 030329 . *",
    "the x - ray light curve can be generally described by an initial steep decay slope @xmath131=5.1@xmath20.2 , a break time @xmath51=530@xmath225 s , flat decay slope @xmath70=0.14@xmath20.02 with a break at @xmath53=56.8@xmath210 ks , and a steep decay slope @xmath71=1.29@xmath20.03 . *",
    "the unusually long flat decay phase of the afterglow of grb060729 implies a much larger energy injection than seen in any other grb afterglow .",
    "* after the initial phase , the light curves in x - rays as well as in all 6 uvot filters follow the same shape . * in the initial phase the afterglow shows a dramatic change in its x - ray spectrum which can either be described by a steepening of a power law spectrum with a simultaneous decrease in the intrinsic column density , or a decrease in the black body temperature from 0.6 kev at 130s after the burst to 0.1 kev at 250s observed after the burst . * the spectral analysis of the  xrt pc mode and  epic pn and mos data shows that the x - ray spectrum of the afterglow agrees with an absorbed power law with @xmath5=1.1 and an intrinsic column density @xmath132 @xmath7 .",

    "<S> the x - ray light curve displays a break at about 60 ks after the burst . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray decay slope after the break is @xmath1=1.29@xmath20.03 . up to 125 days after the burst we do not detect a jet break , suggesting that the jet opening angle is larger than 28@xmath3 . in the first 2 minutes after the burst ( rest frame ) the x - ray spectrum of the burst changed dramatically from a hard x - ray spectrum to a very soft one . </S>",

    "<S> a break at about 50 ks is clearly detected in all 6 uvot filters from a shallow decay slope of about 0.3 and a steeper decay slope of 1.3 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral energy distributions show that there is no spectral development between x - rays and the uv / optical throughout the observation . </S>",
