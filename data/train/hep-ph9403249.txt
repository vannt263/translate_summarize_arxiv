    "heavy quark effective theory is by now the standard description for systems with one heavy quark @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the additional symmetries appearing in the limit of infinite heavy quark mass yield model independent relations between form factors appearing in the description of heavy hadron exclusive weak decays . aside from that",
    ", heavy quark symmetries also yield statements about the normalization of some form factors at zero recoil , i.e.  the point where the velocities of the initial and final hadrons are equal .",
    "this fact has a very large phenomenological impact ; it allows e.g.to perform a model independent determination of @xmath2 by extrapolating to the endpoint of the lepton spectrum in the decay @xmath5 .",
    "qcd radiative corrections as well as recoil corrections have been studied already to next - to - leading order @xcite .",
    "while qcd radiative corrections may be studied systematically , the recoil corrections in general need new , non - perturbative input , which may be supplied , for instance , by model estimates . for the case of the determination of @xmath2 from @xmath5 the leading recoil corrections vanish at the non - recoil point due to lukes theorem @xcite and the next - to - leading ones have been considered by falk and neubert @xcite , who parameterized the form factors to order @xmath6 , also off the point of equal velocities .",
    "however , as will be discussed below , that the analysis of the @xmath7 corrections at zero recoil simplifies enormously , since then only forward matrix elements ( i.e. matrix elements of operators between mesons moving with the same velocity ) appear .",
    "in addition , the algebra of dirac matrices simplifies and one may obtain a simple expression for the next - to - leading recoil corrections at the point of equal velocity .",
    "this expression involves forward matrix elements of operators of higher dimension and also time ordered products with higher order recoil terms from the lagrangian .",
    "the expressions we obtain have a simple interpretation , but its numerical evaluation needs input beyond heavy quark effective theory .",
    "recently , the methods of the heavy mass expansion have been applied also to inclusive decays by combining the method of operator product expansion with heavy quark effective theory @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this approach yields the heavy mass expansion for decay rates and also for decay distributions ; the leading term in this expansion is the free quark decay rate and the corrections may be studied systematically . of course , the higher order corrections need non - perturbative input , which is again forward matrix elements of higher dimensional operators and time ordered products of such operators with higher order terms from the lagrangian .",
    "thus the same matrix elements appear as in the model independent determination of @xmath8 .",
    "finally , the relation of the heavy hadron mass to the mass of the heavy quark is also given in terms of a @xmath7 expansion .",
    "higher orders are again given by forward matrix elements of higher dimensional operators needed as non - perturbative input to relate the heavy quark mass with the heavy hadron mass .    in the present paper , a systematic study is performed for these forward matrix elements appearing in all higher order calculations at zero recoil , including the relevant time ordered products with higher order terms of the lagrangian .",
    "it turns out that all the forward matrix elements may be classified very simply and the relevant matrix elements for calculations up to order @xmath9 are given explicitly .",
    "the classification performed here allows to simplify the analysis of the recoil corrections to heavy quark weak decay form factors at @xmath10 enormously , compared to the case off the equal velocity point . as an application",
    "the analysis for weak decay form factors is performed at the non - recoil point up to second order in the heavy mass expansion for the case of @xmath11 transitions and our results are compared with the ones obtained by falk and neubert @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "a general discussion of the parametrization of the generic forward matrix element is given .",
    "it is split into three subsections .",
    "first we consider local higher dimensional operators in some detail and give numerical estimates for the matrix elements of operators up to dimension seven . in the second subsection we shall consider time ordered products with higher order terms from the lagrangian .",
    "finally , in the third subsection we consider the relation between the mass of the heavy meson and the mass of the heavy quark as a toy example , where the forward matrix elements play a role .",
    "the general discussion of the forward matrix elements is then applied in section 3 to the @xmath6 corrections of the normalization of the weak decay form factors in the decays @xmath12 and @xmath5 .",
    "the relevant form factors @xmath13 for @xmath12 and @xmath1 for @xmath5 decays are discussed at the non - recoil point up to second order in the heavy mass expansion . we include also a semi - quantitative analysis ad estimate the size of the corrections relevant for the @xmath8 determination to order @xmath6 .",
    "higher order terms in the heavy mass expansion of weak transition matrix elements originate in general from two sources .",
    "the first source is the heavy mass expansion of the operators for a heavy quark @xmath14 appearing in the weak transition hamiltonian . at the matching scale @xmath15 ,",
    "this amounts to the replacement @xcite @xmath16                \\frac{i\\slash{d}^\\perp } { 2m_q } \\right ) q_v ( x)\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the velocity of the heavy hadron and @xmath18 is the operator of a static heavy quark moving with velocity @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , it is convenient to define @xmath19 these terms in general lead to contributions , which are matrix elements of local operators .",
    "secondly , also the lagrangian of full qcd is expanded in @xmath7 and the higher orders in @xmath7 are treated as perturbations .",
    "this leads to time ordered products involving these higher order terms of the lagrangian and the weak transition operator .",
    "the corrections of higher orders in the @xmath7 expansion to the lagrangian are given at tree level by @xcite @xmath20 in every order @xmath21 it is convenient to split @xmath22 into a generalized kinetic energy operator @xmath23 and chromomagnetic moment operator @xmath24 defined as @xmath25    the interpretation of these time ordered product terms is obvious .",
    "the heavy hadron states of full qcd still depend on the heavy quark mass , and this dependence is also treated in a @xmath7 expansion .",
    "the leading term is the state taken in the infinite mass limit , the `` static state '' , which is the convenient one for a heavy quark effective theory calculation , since it does not depend on the heavy mass any more .",
    "the time ordered products account for correct mass dependence of the full qcd state , and the matrix elements then have to be evaluated using the `` static '' , mass independent state .",
    "the generic operator of dimension @xmath26 appearing in the contexts mentioned above is of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an arbitrary dirac matrix .    the dirac matrix appearing in ( [ genop ] ) may be expanded into the 16 basis dirac matrices @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    ". however , the matrix @xmath28 is sandwiched between projectors @xmath34 which are contained in the heavy quark fields @xmath18 .",
    "this projection amounts to the replacements @xmath35 where we have defined the spin matrices @xmath36 , which are the generalizations of the pauli matrices for the frame moving with velocity @xmath17 .",
    "they satisfy the relations @xmath37 consequently , the dirac matrix @xmath28 sandwiched between the projectors may be expanded into the four matrices @xmath29 and @xmath36 @xmath38 and it is sufficient to consider only the two operators @xmath39    in the following we shall consider the matrix elements between the ground state pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "there are two different cases to be studied . in the first case",
    "the initial and the final state are both either @xmath40 or @xmath41 ; in the second case the initial state is @xmath40 and the final state is @xmath41 or vice versa .",
    "all these different cases are related by heavy quark spin symmetry , which implies the relations @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 denotes the @xmath40 and @xmath41 ground state meson respectively .",
    "further restrictions on the structure of the matrix elements may be obtained from the equations of motion for the heavy quark and the gluons @xmath45 \\right]_{ab } = 4 \\pi \\alpha_s   \\sum_q \\left [ \\bar{q}_b \\gamma_\\mu q_a - \\frac{1}{n_c } \\delta_{ab}\\ ,   \\bar{q}_d \\gamma_\\mu q_d \\right]\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all quark flavors and @xmath46 are color indices",
    ".    we shall start the discussion with the case where both , initial and final state are either @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "spin symmetry relates the matrix elements of @xmath40 mesons with the ones of the @xmath41 case in the following way latexmath:[\\ ] ] all other matrix elements of time ordered products are related to these by the normalization condition for the vector current in the full theory .",
    "all these matrix elements are non - perturbative . in principle",
    "they may be measured on the lattice and first results have been reported @xcite . however , in the meantime one has to rely on some model to estimate their size . in the present paper we have used a reasonable guess for the spin symmetry conserving contributions of the time ordered products to get some upper limit for the @xmath7 corrections to @xmath1 at the non - recoil point .",
    "the main result of this analysis is that the corrections to @xmath262 are small , ranging between @xmath275 and zero .",
    "including also the leading and subleading qcd radiative corrections @xcite to the normalization of @xmath1 one concludes that @xmath276 and thus the corrections at zero recoil are small .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank m. neubert for help in the comparison with @xcite , and a. ali and n. uraltsev for stimulating discussions ."
