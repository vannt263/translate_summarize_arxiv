    "the classical signal for lepton number violation at a hadron collider is like - sign di - leptons with ( two ) jets and no missing energy @xcite , although also tri - lepton final states as possible signal have been suggested @xcite .",
    "we instead discuss displaced vertices as a possibility to search for sterile neutrinos at the lhc .",
    "the advantage of a displaced vertex search is that for decay lengths of the order of very roughly @xmath5 $ ] m there is little ( or no ) standard model background .",
    "thus , in principle , a discovery could be claimed with as few as ( 3 - 5 ) events .",
    "below , we will consider two different setups in which heavy neutral leptons could occur .",
    "( i ) motivated by the seesaw mechanism , the standard model extended by the addition of a sterile majorana neutrino . and , ( ii ) the ( minimal ) left - right symmetric extension of the standard model .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments have shown that neutrinos have non - zero masses .",
    "for the current status of oscillation data see , for example @xcite . in the classical seesaw mechanism",
    "@xcite the smallness of the neutrino mass is due to the large mass of the right - handed neutrinos , expressed in the famous seesaw relation as @xmath6 . for yukawa couplings of order @xmath7 current neutrino data then put @xmath8 in the range @xmath9 gev , forever in the realm of theoretical speculation .",
    "however , for smaller yukawa couplings , say of the order @xmath10 , sterile neutrinos with masses @xmath11 gev could exist .",
    "note that the naive expectation for heavy - light neutrino mixing in the seesaw is @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 .",
    "obviously , none of the limits on heavy lepton mixing discussed above comes even close to this expectation .",
    "expectations for a discovery are much higher for left - right ( l - r ) symmetric extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "if the right - handed neutrinos , necessarily present in l - r models , have a majorana mass @xcite , they appear in accelerators as `` sterile '' heavy objects and their majorana nature can be probed by searching for like - sign di - leptons @xcite . for @xmath14 , but @xmath15 the sterile neutrino n can be produced via an effective operator @xmath16 , with @xmath17 decaying to @xmath18 .",
    "different from the case of the standard model plus sterile neutrino , here the production cross section and the decay length are not suppressed by the small mixing @xmath19 , but depend mostly on the unknown mass of the heavy @xmath20 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly summarize the main formulas for production and decay of sterile neutrinos for our two models .",
    "section [ sect : dsplcd ] then discusses numerical results for displaced vertex searches , first in section [ sect : sterile ] for sm + sterile neutrino and in section [ sect : lr ] for the case of lr symmetry .",
    "we then close the paper with a short discussion .",
    "here we consider two setups with sterile neutrinos : ( i ) an extension of the sm field contents with a non - fixed number @xmath21 of the sm singlet fermions @xmath22 of unspecified origin and ( ii ) the left - right ( l - r ) symmetric model having three right - handed neutrinos @xmath22 the l - r partners of the usual left - handed neutrinos @xmath23 .      adding @xmath24 species of sm singlet right - handed neutrinos @xmath25 allows together with the three left - handed weak doublet neutrinos @xmath26 one to construct a mass term @xmath27 where @xmath28 are @xmath29 and @xmath30 symmetric majorana mass matrices , and",

    "a unitary rotation @xmath34 leads to @xmath35 majorana neutrinos with masses @xmath36 .",
    "the matrix @xmath37 is the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "this spectrum must contain the three very light neutrinos with different masses and dominated by the active flavors @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath24 heavy states @xmath40 with the masses @xmath41 and the active neutrino admixtures @xmath42 subject to the experimental constraints discussed in the introduction ( see , for instance @xcite ) . in what follows we",
    "consider the case of only one heavy sterile neutrino @xmath17 .",
    "thus there are four parameters characterizing the scenario in question : the neutrino mass @xmath43 and its mixing @xmath44 with the active flavors @xmath45 .",
    "the heavy sterile neutrino charged ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) interactions are @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "the left - handed sector neutrino mixing matrix @xmath48 , that appears in neutrino oscillations , coincides with the pmns matrix .",
    "the matrix @xmath44 describes the mixing between heavy and light neutrino sectors .",
    "the heavy neutrino @xmath17 total decay rate @xmath49 in the mass range @xmath50[1,80 ] gev , used in the next section , is given in appendix .",
    "the half - life @xmath51 for neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath52 ) decay in this framework is @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the phase space factor and nuclear matrix element .",
    "their values can be found in , for instance , the recent review @xcite .",

    "the gauge symmetry is broken to the sm symmetry at some scale @xmath60 , at least somewhat larger than the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",

    "we denoted the masses of @xmath70 as @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively .",
    "maximal @xmath65 mixing is reached for @xmath73 when @xmath74 . imposing the perturbativity condition @xmath75 and using @xmath76 @xcite we find the upper bound @xmath77 for the total decay of each of the three heavy neutrinos of the l - r models in the mass range the neutral current contribution is negligible and we approximately have : @xmath78 \\sum_{l }",

    "the half - life @xmath51 for neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath52 ) decay via heavy @xmath20 and heavy @xmath17 exchange is given by : @xmath79 in the numerical section we will consider a simplified case with only one heavy neutrino in the relevant mass range .",
    "we have implemented the two models discussed above in calchep @xcite for the calculation of the cross section .",
    "we have compared our calculation for the sterile neutrino with cross sections available in the literature @xcite and found good agreement .",
    "we will first discuss the theoretically simpler case of sm plus sterile neutrino .      in the sm plus sterile neutrino scenario , the decay length of the heavy neutrino",
    "can be written as a function of two unknown parameters : @xmath80\\ ] ] here , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the average energy of the heavy neutrino @xmath17 which we calculated numerically .",
    "the heavy neutrino half - life is denoted by @xmath84 .",
    "decay lengths testable at the lhc are roughly of the order of @xmath85 m and thus , sterile neutrino masses between @xmath86 $ ] gev could lead to measurable displaced vertices .",
    "the cross section for sterile neutrino production at 14 tev can be separated into a bare cross sections times a factor containing the neutrino mixing @xcite .",
    "the bare cross section is huge , reaching several nb for neutrino masses below @xmath87 .",
    "this allows , in principle , to constrain heavy neutrino mixing to impressively small values .",
    "however , the resulting events from production and decay of sterile neutrino produced by an off - shell w - boson are relatively soft . correspondingly we have found that our results do very sensitively depend on the cuts used in the analysis .",
    "the lepton - based triggers used by the atlas collaboration in the 2012 run were @xcite : for two electrons ( muons ) , either both electrons ( muons ) have to have a @xmath88 gev ( @xmath89 gev ) or the leading electron ( muon ) has to have @xmath90 gev ( @xmath91 gev ) with the second electron required to have @xmath92 gev ( @xmath93 gev ) .",

    "we have discussed a possible displaced vertex search at the lhc to constrain ( or discover ! ) signals of heavy neutral leptons . we have worked in the sm , extended by a sterile neutrino , and have also discussed the case of a left - right symmetric extension of the standard model .",
    "limits from non - observation of double beta decay are very stringent and lhc will need at least 300 fb@xmath101 to be competitive in the search for @xmath126 . however , the best limits on @xmath149 , due to lep , could be surpassed with order @xmath150 ) fb@xmath101 already , although strongly depending on cuts as we have discussed in some detail .    the prospects for discovery of a signal look much brighter in the left - right symmetric model .",

    "finally , we would like to close mentioning that we have assumed there is no significant generation mixing in the heavy neutrino sector , i.e. events are always @xmath152- or @xmath153-like . obviously , and given the experience with the large mixing angles in the active neutrino sector , this does not have to be true at all . particularly if there is one heavy neutrino which mixes significantly in the @xmath154 sector , limits from lhc",
    "will be much worse than our estimates for @xmath152- or @xmath153-like events , due to the rather poor @xmath155 reconstruction efficiencies of the lhc experiments .",
