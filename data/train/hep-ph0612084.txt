    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is regarded as the correct theory for strong interactions .",
    "investigation of bound states of quarks ( and/or gluons ) is one of the most effective methods to study this dynamics among these constituents .",
    "since the task of calculating hadron structure from qcd itself is very difficult ( as can be seen from various lattice qcd methods ) , one can on the other hand rely on specific models to gain some understanding of it at low energies , and this study can most effectively be accomplished by applying a particular framework to a diverse range of phenomena .",
    "meson decays provide an important opportunity for exploring the structure of these simplest bound states in qcd and for studying the non - perturbative ( long distance ) aspect of the strong interactions . besides vector mesons ( see , e.g. , @xcite and refs . therein ) , pseudo - scalar mesons have for a long time been a major focus of attention to understand the inner structure of hadrons from non - perturbative qcd .",
    "a number of such studies @xcite dealing with decays of pseudo - scalar mesons at quark level of compositeness have been carried out recently . in this paper",
    ", we study leptonic decays of pseudo - scalar mesons such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which proceed through the coupling of the quark - antiquark loop to the axial vector current as shown in figure 1 .    a realistic description of pseudo - scalar mesons at the quark level of compositeness would be an important element in our understanding of hadron dynamics and reaction processes at scales where qcd degrees of freedom are relevant .",
    "such studies offer a direct probe of hadron structure and help in revealing some aspects of the underlying quark - gluon dynamics . the relativistic description for analyzing mesons as composite objects is provided by the framework of bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) in this paper .",
    "we employ the qcd oriented bse under covariant instantaneous ansatz ( cia ) @xcite .",
    "cia is a lorentz - covariant generalization of instantaneous approximation . for @xmath6 system",
    ", cia formulation @xcite ensures an exact interconnection between 3d and 4d forms of the bse .",
    "the 3d form of bse serves for making contact with the mass spectra , whereas the 4d form provides the @xmath7 vertex function @xmath8 for the evaluation of various transition amplitudes .",
    "a bse framework under instantaneous approximation formulation similar to the cia formulation was also earlier suggested by the bonn group @xcite .    we had earlier employed the framework of bse under cia for calculation of decay constants @xcite of heavy - light pseudo - scalar mesons and @xmath9 for @xmath10 process .",
    "we also evaluated the leptonic decays of vector mesons , such as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xcite in this framework .",
    "however , one of the simplified assumptions in all these calculations was that the @xmath7 vertex was restricted to have a single dirac structure ( e.g. , @xmath14 for pseudo - scalar mesons , @xmath15 for vector mesons , etc . ) .",
    "however , recent studies @xcite have revealed that various mesons have many different covariant structures in their wave functions whose inclusion was also found necessary to obtain quantitatively accurate observables @xcite and it was further noticed that all dirac covariants do not contribute equally and only some of them are relevant for calculation of meson mass spectrum and decay constants .",
    "such a copious dirac structure of the bs wave function in fact was already indicated by llewellyn smith @xcite .",
    "hence it is necessary to introduce various dirac structures into the @xmath7 vertex for different kinds of mesons . in the recent work @xcite",
    ", we developed a power counting rule for incorporating various dirac covariants in the structure of vertex function , order by order in powers of inverse of meson mass , and calculated the leptonic decays of equal mass vector mesons such as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath16 , taking into account the leading order covariants since they are expected to contribute maximum to observables according to our scheme . on the line of that work , in this paper",
    "we first discuss the power counting rule for choosing various dirac covariants from their complete set ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) for pseudo - scalar mesons in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we calculate leptonic decay constants of them employing the wave function developed in section 2 .",
    "we then conclude with discussions in section 4 .",
    "for introducing the variables and for the convenience to discuss the generalized hadron - quark vertex in bs wave function under cia , we give the similar outline for cia as in ref .",
    "we start with a 4d bse for scalar @xmath6 system with an effective kernel @xmath2 and 4d wave function @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , the inverse propagators of two scalar quarks , are : @xmath20 here @xmath21 are ( effective ) constituent masses of quarks .",
    "the 4-momenta of the quark and anti - quark , @xmath22 , are related to the internal 4-momentum @xmath23 and total momentum @xmath24 of hadron of mass @xmath25 as @xmath26 where @xmath27/2 $ ] are the wightman - garding ( wg ) definitions @xcite of masses of individual quarks .",
    "the cia ansatz on the bs kernel @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is observed to be orthogonal to the total 4-momentum @xmath24 ( i.e. , @xmath30 , irrespective of whether the individual quarks are on - shell or off - shell .",
    "a similar form of the bs kernel was also suggested in ref .",
    ". the longitudinal component of @xmath23 , @xmath31 does not appear in the form @xmath32 of the kernel .",
    "for reducing eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) to the 3d form , one can define a 3d wave function @xmath33 as @xmath34    following usual steps outlined in @xcite , we get the @xmath7 vertex function @xmath35 under cia for the case of scalar quarks : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a 3d denominator function whose value can be easily worked out by contour integration by noting the positions of the poles in the complex @xmath38plane @xcite . by this process , an exact interconnection between 3d wave function @xmath33 and the 4d wave function @xmath39 and hence that between 3d and 4d bse is thus brought out , where the 3d form serves for making contact with the mass spectrum of hadrons , whereas the 4d form provides the @xmath7 vertex function @xmath35 which satisfies a 4d bse with a natural off - shell extension over the entire 4d space ( due to the positive definiteness of the quantity @xmath40 throughout the entire 4d space ) and thus provides a fully lorentz - covariant basis for evaluation of various transition amplitudes through various quark loop diagrams ( see figure 1 ) .    to apply the above simplified discussions to the case of fermionic quarks constituting a particular meson we proceed in the same manner as @xcite : the scalar propagators @xmath41 in the above equations are replaced by the proper fermionic propagators @xmath42 .",
    "then , on observing the vertex @xmath35 now is a @xmath43 matrix in the spinor space , we should incorporate its relevant dirac structures , for which we take guidance from some recent studies @xcite , as well as llewelyn - smith s classic paper @xcite , which have revealed that various mesons have many different covariant structures in their wave functions whose inclusion was found necessary to obtain quantitatively accurate observables .",
    "it was also noticed recently @xcite that all dirac covariants do not contribute equally and only some covariants are considered to be relevant for calculation of mass spectrum and decay constants .",
    "@xcite has also calculated masses and decay constants of vector mesons for various subsets of covariants from their complete set . towards this end",
    ", we make use of the power counting rule developed in @xcite for incorporating various dirac covariants in the structure of @xmath7 vertex function for a particular meson , order - by - order in powers of inverse of the meson mass @xmath25 , so as to systematically choose among various covariants from their complete set and write wave functions for various mesons .    as far as a pseudo - scalar meson is concerned",
    ", its @xmath7 vertex function , which has a certain dimensionality of mass , can be expressed as a linear combination of four dirac covariants @xmath44 @xcite , each multiplying a lorentz scalar amplitude @xmath45 .",
    "the choice of the dirac covariants is not unique as can also be seen from the choice of covariants used in ref .",
    "@xcite . for adapting this decomposition",
    "to write the structure of vertex function @xmath35 , we re - express the @xmath7 vertex function by making the amplitudes @xmath46 dimensionless , weighing each dirac covariant with an appropriate power of @xmath25 .",
    "thus each term in the expansion of @xmath35 is associated with a certain power of @xmath25 . in detail",
    ", we can express @xmath47 as a polynomial in various powers of @xmath48 : @xmath49 with @xmath50 here @xmath51 are four dimensionless and constant coefficients ( which are taken to be constant on lines of @xcite , only to consider the leading powers of @xmath48 ) to be determined .",
    "now since we use constituent quark masses where the quark mass @xmath52 is approximately half of the hadron mass @xmath25 , we can use the ansatz @xmath53 in the rest frame of the hadron ( among all the pseudo - scalar mesons , pion enjoys the special status in view of its unusually small mass ( @xmath54 ) and its case should be considered separately .",
    "see the discussions in section 4 ) . then each of the four terms in eq . ( [ eq10 ] ) receives suppression by different powers of @xmath48 .",
    "thus we can arrange these terms as an expansion in powers of @xmath55 .",
    "we can see in the expansion of @xmath56 that the structures associated with the coefficients @xmath57 have magnitudes @xmath58 and are of leading order , while those with @xmath59 are @xmath60and are next - to - leading order .",
    "this nave power counting rule suggests that the maximum contribution to the calculation of any pseudo - scalar meson observable should come from the leading order dirac structures @xmath14 and @xmath61 associated with the constant coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively . as a first application of this to the pseudo - scalar meson sector and on lines similar to @xcite for vector meson case ,",
    "we take the form of the @xmath7 vertex function incorporating the leading order terms in expansion ( [ eq10 ] ) and ignoring @xmath60 terms for the moment , i.e. , @xmath64% \\frac{1}{2\\pi i}n_{p}d(\\hat{q})\\phi ( \\hat{q})\\quad .",
