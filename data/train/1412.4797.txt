    "the real range of values of dolp is between 0.8 and -0.8 @xcite .",
    "the theory behind the simulations has , by definition , considered this aspect .",
    "the second fact to take into account is the presence of the 50/50 beam splitter used to separate the tppl signal . the s- and",
    "p - polarization transmission of such beam splitters is different . we will need to introduce a correction factor on the measured angular patterns .",
    "since we use a linear polarizer to measure , this correction factor will only be taken into account when adding angular patterns of perpendicular polarizations to obtain the total angular pattern ."

    "<S> the most sensible definition for an optical antenna is therefore a device that converts a propagating wave into a signal in the near field , and vice versa , converts a plasmon oscillation into a propagating wave , with resonant behavior similar to that of common antennas but determined by plasmon resonances @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> however , the presence of active elements in the antenna system , such as amplifiers , lossy components or nonlinear elements , can breakdown this reciprocity @xcite . reception of a propagating wave then elicits an electrical signal , but driving the antenna with this signal will not lead to emission of the same propagating wave . </S>",
    "<S> common non - reciprocal antennas are widely being used in , for instance , 3d radar systems where the emission needs to be as broad ( spectrally and spatially ) as possible while the reception must be very narrow and directed to get full knowledge of the position , shape and even composition of the target @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> non - reciprocity means that effectively , a shift has been introduced between the excitation and emission resonances of the antenna which leads to a different behavior of the system when being used as a receiving or as an emitting antenna . as a consequence , to fully characterize the response of a non - reciprocal antenna , it is necessary to measure its spectral , angular and polarization response @xcite in both reception and emission working modes @xcite . in nanophotonics , </S>",

    "<S> the peak shift in the @xmath3-polarized emission is attributed to the cross - polarization of the @xmath4-oriented dipole in a high na objective , when the increase in width shifts the antenna in and out of resonance with the intrinsic tppl emission spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> two resonant modes can clearly be observed in the @xmath4-polarized emission . </S>",

    "<S> the spectral maximum is outside the detection window ( right arrow ) , which leads to a an artificially stable spectral maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the diminution of the counts around 600 nm ( left arrow ) is attributed to the disappearance of the small contribution of the cross - polarization of a @xmath4-oriented dipole . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) spectral evolution of the @xmath4-polarized tppl emission for gold nanopads of widths 70 nm , 170 nm , 200 nm , 230 nm , 240 nm , 260 nm and 280 nm . as the width increases , the peak of the spectrum ( right arrow ) is moving towards higher wavelengths and disappearing from the detection window . </S>",
    "<S> when further increasing the width ( > 230 nm ) a second order resonance mode of the emission starts to appear around 600 nm ( left arrow ) . </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=99.0% ]    from figure 4 it is clear that @xmath3- and @xmath4-polarized emission show different spectra , leading to the possibility of combined directional and spectral control ; different parts of the angular spectrum of the emission will contain different spectral components . </S>",
    "<S> this concept is elaborated upon in figure 5 , where we show two examples of full multi - parameter control of non - reciprocal antennas . in particular , figure 5(a ) shows the spectra for @xmath3- and @xmath4-polarized emission for a gold nanoantenna of ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5)=(110 , 70 , 40 ) nm . from figures 3(b - c ) it is established that those emission bands are dominated by dipolar angular spectra , oriented in @xmath3- and @xmath4-direction . </S>",
    "<S> this is confirmed in figure 5(b ) , where the angular pattern , color coded for polarization ( red represents pol@xmath26 and green pol@xmath27 ; yellow represents a mix of polarizations ) , shows how different polarizations , containing different spectral components , are emitted at different angles . </S>",
    "<S> the emission in @xmath4-direction is for instance dominated by light with wavelength around 650 nm , whereas the emission in @xmath3-direction is dominated by a broad spectrum between 440 and 600 nm .    </S>",
    "<S> this complete information about the spectral and spatial content of the tppl emission of a non - reciprocal nanoantenna now allows us to imagine a new use for such a device : that of nanometrically , substructure - localized tunable excitation source . </S>",

    "<S> it is obvious that different modes are located at different positions on the nanorod ; excitation of the rod with 800 nm light and positioning a molecule or other nanosized absorber near the antenna would give us sub - antenna sized localization accuracy based on the relative excitation probability of the system , or the possibility to multiplex detection , i.e. enhance the detection of different molecular species with the same antenna , excited with the same 800 nm light .    * control of nonreciprocal antennas . * </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath4-projection of the polarization ( pol@xmath28 ) shows a strong broad resonance peak around 600 nm wavelength while the peak of the @xmath3-projection of the polarization ( pol@xmath29 ) is filtered out . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath3- and @xmath4-polarized emission seem to be largely disentangled from each other ( figure 5(d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the tppl signal at lower wavelengths is heavily dominated by @xmath4-polarized emission while at larger wavelengths the @xmath3-polarized takes the lead . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity of the angular pattern shown in figure 5(e ) has increased compared to previous case and shows the different angles at which lower and higher wavelengths are emitted ( green and red ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of the near - field obtained by fdtd simulations also shows an increased complexity . </S>",
    "<S> different sub - diffraction regions around the nanoantenna containing different wavelengths are routed towards different angles . </S>",
    "<S> these examples shows how the emission from non - reciprocal antennas can be spatially , angularly and spectrally controlled independent from the excitation .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , our findings for gold and aluminum suggest different uses for both of them : aluminum antennas are able to achieve a much purer dipole - like emission , whereas the tunability of the emission properties of gold antennas is much larger . for aluminum antennas , it is therefore feasible to talk about a broadband dipole with a bandwidth of more than 200 nanometers , which is eminently suited for ultrafast plasmonics . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> gold antennas give better combined angular - spectral control of the emission which is better for chemical detection , positioning , or signal converters ( e.g. angular conversion of wavelength conversion ) .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we introduced the equivalent of a non - reciprocal antenna at optical frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> our approach was based on nonlinear excitation of gold and aluminum plasmonic nanoantennas . </S>",
    "<S> the versatility of these systems was shown by tuning the angular and spectral properties of their emission modes independent of their reception mode . </S>",
    "<S> broadband and tunable emission modes were demonstrated , as well as the possibility of either increasing emission or detection fidelity by combining multiple channels , or multiplexing detection / emission possibilities along different channels . </S>",
    "<S> the full spatial , spectral and angular information for these antennas was shown , allowing the envisioning of improved chemical detection , localization and signal conversion applications , which , depending on the material , could be used in ultrafast or high - spatial resolution applications .    </S>",
