    "observationally , the situation is still very unclear . in nearby galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "one interpretation of these results is that there is an evolutionary sequence driven by nuclear activity : i.e. agn are triggered in galaxies on the blue sequence , gas in these systems is heated , and galaxies move onto the red sequence as star formation shuts down @xcite .",
    "however , this interpretation is certainly not unique . at a fixed black hole mass ,",
    "agn tend to be found preferentially in galaxies with younger stellar populations ( and hence more gas ) .",
    "the presence of a gaseous fuel supply may simply be a necessary condition for both star formation and accretion onto the black hole @xcite .",
    "one way to ascertain whether agn are responsible for terminating the growth of massive galaxies , is to establish a direct link between the presence of an active nucleus and the _ gas content _ of such galaxies .",
    "there have only been a few _ systematic _ studies of the hi content of the host galaxies of moderately large samples of agn .",
    "@xcite conducted a survey of neutral gas in a representative sample of 154 moderate to high luminosity nearby type i agn .",
    "their results appear to challenge the feedback scenario because agn are found to be at least as gas rich as quiescent objects of the same morphological type .",

    "we use the 4000 break measured from the sdss 3 arcsec - diameter fiber spectrum , @xmath15 . as discussed in @xcite , @xmath15 can serve as a measure of the age of the stellar population of galaxies , although there is a secondary dependence on metallicity . the galaxies in our sample are located at low redshifts ( @xmath1 ) , and in 72% of our sample the 3 arcsec fiber covers less than 20% of the petrosian radius enclosing 90% of the total light of the galaxy .",
    "the 4000 break values should thus be regarded as a measure of stellar population age for the inner nuclear regions of the galaxies , while the nuv@xmath7 colour is a proxy for the specific star formation rate sfr ( ssfr , i.e. sfr per unit stellar mass ) .",
    "finally , we extract the following emission fluxes : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , [ nii ] , [ oiii ] ( in units of @xmath18erg@xmath19s@xmath20@xmath21 ) , which we use to classify the nuclear activity of our galaxies by means of the diagnostic diagram first defined by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter bpt ) .",

    "as discussed in @xcite , the luminosity of the [ oiii]@xmath225007 line should be a reasonably reliable tracer of black hole accretion rate . because it is a high excitation line , it is less contaminated by emission from hii regions than other lines such as @xmath16 .",
    "we correct our line fluxes for dust extinction using the balmer decrement , following eq .",

    "we note that @xcite suggested a more stringent cut to separate galaxies where the nuclear emission is almost completely excited by emission from the gas accreting onto the black holes , rather than from star - forming regions ( shown as a dashed line in figure [ fig01 ] ) . with this cut",
    ", we obtain a subsample of 912 `` pure '' agn , which is too small for our stacking analysis .",

    "@xcite showed that there appear to be two distinct regimes of black hole growth in galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the first is associated with galaxies with significant ongoing star formation ; in this regime the distribution of accretion rates shows little dependence on the central stellar population of the galaxy .",
    "the second regime is associated with `` passive '' galaxies , and is characterized by a power - law distribution of accretion rates . there",
    ", the accretion rate does depend strongly on the age of the central stellar population in the galaxy .",
    "we now take a look at hi gas mass fraction trends for blue and red galaxy sub - populations .",
    "we define red sequence galaxies to have nuv@xmath7@xmath294.5 , and blue sequence galaxies to have nuv@xmath7@xmath314.5 .",

    "the average hi gas fraction remains constant as a function of the accretion rate parameter l[oiii]/@xmath28 for the blue population .",
    "the increase in hi gas fraction as a function of l[oiii]/@xmath28 seen in figure [ fig03 ] is in fact driven by galaxies on the red sequence .",
    "we note that we had to increase the bin size for these objects in order to recover sufficient signal in our stacks .",
    "our control samples of red and blue galaxies exhibit the same trends with l[oiii]/@xmath28 as the agn , but the gas mass fractions are slightly higher for the blue control objects , and lower for the red control objects .",

    "the nuv@xmath7 colours we use are not corrected for dust extinction .",

    "reliable estimates of the specific star formation rates of our galaxies may be obtained by fitting spectral energy distribution models to the 7-band uv and sdss data , and calibrating the attenuation as function of nuv@xmath7 colour using a reference sample with direct measurements of the uv through far - ir spectral energy distribution from a combination of galex , sdss and spitzer data .",

    "the new results are shown in the right panel of figure [ fig04 ] .",
    "red symbols denote objects with low specific star formation rates ( @xmath32sfr / m@xmath3@xmath31 - 11.0 ) , while blue symbols are for more strongly star - forming galaxies ( @xmath32sfr / m@xmath3@xmath33 - 11.0 ) . once again",
    ", this division has been made based on the bimodal distribution of ssfr in our sample .",
    "we see the same trends as before , with no significant difference in hi content between the blue agn hosts and control galaxies .",
    "the same conclusion holds for red agn hosts , although we note that the two highest accretion rate bins yield non - detections .",
    "this is because many of these galaxies shift over to the blue sequence after dust corrections are made .",
    "we note that the amount of accretion onto the central supermassive black hole in a galaxy is more likely to be sensitive to the properties of the interstellar medium in the central parts of the galaxy rather then globally .",
    "we now investigate what happens if we split our agn sample into `` red '' and `` blue '' subsamples using @xmath15 , which is measured within the 3 arcsec diameter sdss fiber aperture , and remeasure gas fractions for these two new samples , plus corresponding control galaxies . in this case , blue galaxies have @xmath15@xmath341.6 and red galaxies have @xmath15@xmath351.7 ( this roughly separates the peaks of the bimodal distribution of 4000 break strengths ) . in figure [ fig05 ]",
    "we show our results .",
    "agn hosts exhibit no significant differences in their gas content with respect to non - agn in the same @xmath15 range matched by global colour and @xmath10 .",
    "also the differences in the red population seen in figure [ fig04 ] has now vanished , given that now we detect the same signal for both agn and control galaxies .",
    "we note that the two bins of @xmath15 clearly separate in terms of the trend in gas fraction as a function of the eddington parameter l[oiii]/@xmath28 , consistent with the suggestion of @xcite that accretion onto the black hole is supply - limited in the red galaxy population , but not in the blue one .    /@xmath28",

    "symbols are as in figure [ fig05 ] . ]",
    "we have used the stacking technique developed in a companion paper ( paper i ) to look at possible interplay between nuclear activity and gas content in massive nearby galaxies .",
    "starting from a volume - limited , homogeneous sample of massive galaxies we have selected a sample of agn , and a control sample of inactive galaxies matched by @xmath10 and nuv@xmath7 .",
    "we then stacked their hi data in bins of [ oiii ] line luminosity scaled by black hole mass to assess whether the gas content of agn hosts differs from that of the control galaxies .",
    "our main result is that we do not find any significant difference between the hi gas content of agn hosts and that of control galaxies .",
    "this conclusion holds at all values of the eddington parameter proxy l[oiii]/@xmath28 probed by the galaxies in our sample .",
    "+ if converted into a proper eddington ratio , our sample would cover the range @xmath36 - 4 to -2 .",
    "we are studying the relatively low accretion rate regime , and that could be a reason why we do not see any sign of agn feedback .",
    "we would need data over a larger volume to stack a significant number of agn with very high l / l@xmath37 .",
    "still , up to the highest accretion rates we have studied , the gas fraction shows no hint of correlation with either l[oiii]/@xmath28 ( blue population ) or agn presence .",
    "these results are also in agreement with @xcite .",
    "as discussed in their paper , the lack of any difference may be due to the fact that the hi traces gas on very large scales , but accreting black holes only heat gas close to the centers of the galaxies .    in some simulations of galaxy formation",
    ", agn feedback is an extremely violent process that can drive out much of the interstellar medium from galaxies , truncating ongoing star formation and reddening their stellar populations @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "agn hosts would be expected to be gas deficient .",
    "catastrophic global feedback processes are clearly not occurring in the majority of agn in the local universe .",
    "we can not yet ascertain that agn feedback is important in the centers of galaxies . in future work",
    ", we plan to examine trends in molecular gas fractions in agn hosts using data from the cold gass survey ( saintonge et al 2011 ) .",
    "the molecular gas is generally more centrally concentrated that the atomic gas and may be more sensitive to feedback processes occurring in the bulge of the galaxy .",
    "another interesting result of our analysis is the scaling of the mean hi gas fraction of agn host galaxies with accretion rate onto the black hole , as traced by l[oiii]/@xmath28 . in the blue galaxy population ,",
    "the accretion rate onto the black hole and the hi gas fraction of the galaxy are independent . however , in the red galaxy population , these two quantities do track each other .",
    "@xcite hypothesized that in blue galaxies , the black hole regulates its own growth at a rate that does not further depend on the properties of the interstellar medium . in red galaxies , they deduced that the decrease in the accretion rate onto black holes in old galaxies was consistent with population synthesis model predictions of the decline in stellar mass loss rates as a function of mean stellar age .    because we now have measured hi mass fractions for the red population , we can check this in more detail .",
    "the average global ( nuv@xmath7)/(@xmath38 ) colours of the host galaxies vary from 4.56/0.74 for the stack with the highest accretion rate in figure [ fig05 ] to 5.54/0.80 for the stack with the lowest accretion rate . as described in @xcite we use population synthesis models ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) to calculate mass loss rates as a function of colour , assuming simple exponential declining star formation histories for our galaxies .",
    "if the hi content of red sequence agn came only from mass loss , we would expect a 0.3 dex change in the average @xmath32(m@xmath2/m@xmath3 ) between agn stacks with the lowest and highest accretion rates in our sample .",
    "figure [ fig05 ] shows a 0.5 dex change in this quantity , which is somewhat larger than predicted .",
    "however , we note that the average stellar surface mass densities of the host galaxies in the stacks decrease by a factor of 3 between agn with the highest and lowest accretion rates ( likewise the concentration index decreases from 3.15 to 2.79 ) , so structural properties are not constant across the population . this may imply that the fuel supply in the red agn population is in fact a mixture of mass loss from stars and gas present in disks .",
