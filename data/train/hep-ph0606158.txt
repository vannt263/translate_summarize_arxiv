    "the origin of the quark masses and their mixing angles is still one of the mysteries of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the great hierarchy of scale between the sm yukawa couplings should be justified in a fundamental theory .",
    "we usually thought about low - energy constants as resulting from some breaking of higher symmetry operators .",
    "several years ago , new mechanisms were proposed by @xcite to explain the hierarchy of the yukawa couplings from geometry of extra space without any new flavor symmetries .    in these models ,",
    "we consider the sm four - dimensional fermionic fields as zero modes of higher - dimensional fields localized at different positions in an extra dimension .",
    "the hierarchies come from the overlap of the extra - dimensional part of the wave functions , which is exponentially small according to their respective distances in the extra dimension . in this framework",
    "we can easily understand the origin of the well - known nearest neighbor mixing : fields which are literally closer in the extra space are coupled stronger than distant fields .",
    "this can explain , at least at the conceptual level , the pattern of the sm quark masses as well as their mixing .    since the work of @xcite we know that under certain assumptions on the profile functions we can find realistic parameters of localization in the background of @xcite which reproduce the correct quark masses and the correct magnitude of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements with one extra dimension . from @xcite , we know that with two extra dimensions we can also reproduce the correct amount of _",
    "cp_-violation from the complex phase of the ckm matrix",
    ". a careful analysis of the neutrino masses and the lepton flavor violation were also done in @xcite .",
    "these authors used gaussian functions for the wave functions overlap , an assumption which can not be applied for the case where the distances between localized branes are larger than the brane widths .",
    "this is the case when the fields are localized on separate branes and not in one ` fat ' brane like in @xcite .",
    "the zero mode is effectively exponential in the bulk , and thus the gaussian functions are not relevant .",
    "we will then follow @xcite and consider the wave functions overlap as being due to their exponential tails . by this way , we use a decaying profile of the zero modes different from those used in previous papers @xcite .",
    "another distinct feature of @xcite , which plays a more interesting role , comes from the consideration of the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking localized on a separate brane .",
    "this allows us to consider three identical generations of quarks localized on three different branes .",
    "the hierarchy of masses between the different generations is then produced by the decaying higgs profile , while their mixing contain also suppression from the distances between the generations ; see fig .",
    "[ graph1 ] . with this pattern ,",
    "the texture of the mass matrix in the weak basis is more natural than the one obtained in @xcite .",
    "now the question remains whether a realistic set of locations can be found to reproduce the correct experimental masses and mixing angles .",
    "our framework provides a non - trivial relationship between the masses and the mixing . in this paper",
    ", we address the question whether this relationship is compatible with the sm quark masses and the ckm matrix .",
    "we found that it is possible to match correctly the experimental data of the quark sector with three identical generations localized in one extra dimension .",
    "for this we need to consider the sm left - handed doublet and the right - handed singlets coupled with different strengths to the brane . with all the fields localized on the same side of the ew symmetry breaking brane",
    ", we found a set of dispersion coefficients and brane distances in the extra dimension reproducing the quark masses and the ckm matrix with the correct strength of _ cp_-violation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ dsscenario ] we sum up the main points of @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ parameterspace ] we present the constraints on the parameters of such a mechanism . in sect .",
    "[ realisticparameters ] we briefly recall the sm parameters and present results of our effort to reproduce these values .",
    "we then conclude in sect .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "let us summarize the main points of the dvali - shifman ( ds ) scenario @xcite .",
    "we consider our universe as @xmath0-dimensional , with topology @xmath1 , the usual minkowski space times an extra space @xmath2 of dimension @xmath3 with size @xmath4 .",
    "the observed sm four - dimensional fields are zero modes of higher - dimensional fields localized on different branes .",
    "a complete theory is given by some field theory and geometry of multiple brane state embedded in @xmath2 , which can be a compactified dimension or a ` fatter ' brane .",
    "the fields building the branes are distinct from the matter fields .",
    "each brane ( which could be d - branes or topological defects for instance ) is responsible for localizing one sm generation . in order to allow interactions among the fermionic fields , the gauge fields are free to propagate throughout @xmath2",
    "this constrains @xmath4 to be @xmath5 to avoid flavor exchange violation at tree level . depending on the underlying model considered",
    ", this constraint could even require @xmath4 to be much smaller @xcite .",
    "we will treat it as a free parameter depending on the complete theory .",
    "a mechanism of embedding multiple brane states in a compact space were proposed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "we will now consider the case of one extra dimension @xmath6 .",
    "one brane inside the extra dimension is responsible for trapping fermionic fields with all the quantum numbers of one sm generation .",
    "thus , a three brane state gives rise to the three known sm generations .",
    "one crucial point of the ds scenario is to consider the ew symmetry breaking happening on a separate brane .",
    "a possible mechanism to localize the higgs field on a brane is proposed in @xcite . in general , producing such condensate results in an exponential shape of the higgs profile in the bulk .",
    "far from the source , the higgs will be seen as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a coefficient of dispersion setting the thickness of the zero mode and @xmath9 is the extra dimension .",
    "the three generations will then obtain an exponential hierarchy of masses if they are localized at different positions in the extra dimension .",
    "this reproduces the well - known hierarchy of masses of the sm generations .",
    "the masses are suppressed according to the overlap of the square of the five - dimensional part of the fermionic zero mode with the decaying higgs profile .",
    "the mixing across the generations contains the additional suppression of the fermionic zero mode overlap .",
    "the further the generations are from each other , the more suppressed the mixing will be ; see fig .  [ graph1 ] .",
    "this is in agreement with the experimental pattern .",
    "we will have the following features independently of the underlying higher - dimensional theory .",
    "let us start from the five - dimensional fermionic fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where the upperscript c stands for the charge conjugate .",
    "only one chirality can be trapped on the brane and so the sm right - handed singlets are provided by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , while the _",
    "su_(2 ) left - handed doublets are produced by @xmath14 .",
    "the yukawa terms are given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the five - dimensional yukawa coupling and @xmath17 the five - dimensional higgs field .",
    "as the fermionic fields are localized on a brane , the following expansion is valid : @xmath18 where @xmath9 is the extra dimension , @xmath19 are zero modes of the four - dimensional dirac operator and @xmath20 is the four - dimensional part of the zero mode of the localized higgs field .",
    "the @xmath21 functions are the extra - dimensional part of the five - dimensional fermionic fields localized at @xmath22 . when considering only the zero modes and generalizing to several generations , @xmath23 where @xmath24 for three generations .",
    "thus , the effective four - dimensional yukawa terms are @xmath25 the @xmath26 functions are given by the solution of the five - dimensional part of the dirac operator . when considering only the left - handed chirality : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a five - dimensional scalar field with a domain wall profile responsible for trapping the fermionic fields ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "equation  ( [ equationomega ] ) gives @xmath29 thus , in the bulk and localizing the field at @xmath30 , @xmath31 with @xmath32 fitting the dispersion of the zero mode . setting the higgs field to its vacuum expectation value @xmath33",
    ", we have the following mass matrices @xmath34 for the up- and down - type quarks , respectively : @xmath35 where @xmath36 contains the five - dimensional yukawa coupling , the higgs vacuum expectation value and some normalization parameters of the @xmath26 functions .",
    "the @xmath30 are the locations in the extra dimension of the branes .",
    "we made the particular choice of localizing the higgs field at @xmath37 , but this plays no role since an overall translation of all the locations lets the integral in ( [ mass matrix ] ) invariant .",
    "the mass terms @xmath38 represent the width of the respective zero mode profiles which depends on the process of localization . as in the general case",
    "the yukawa couplings have complex entries , we consider the elements of ( [ mass matrix ] ) to have arbitrary complex phases .    we see that @xmath34 is invariant under @xmath39 and , thus , the scale @xmath40 of the different parameters can be chosen arbitrarily according to the requirement of the full theory .",
    "we are interested whether the mass matrix ( [ mass matrix ] ) can reproduce the quark masses and mixing angles . due to the flavor symmetry",
    ", we can redefine the fields to bi - diagonalize the matrix , the diagonal elements thus giving the quark masses .",
    "the ckm matrix elements come from the mismatch between the weak and the mass basis . an easy way of computing such elements is to consider the following hermitian matrices : @xmath41 their eigenvalues give the square of the quark masses .",
    "the product of the eigenvectors of @xmath42 with the eigenvectors of @xmath43 gives the ckm matrix .",
    "the global @xmath44 symmetry of the fermionic fields allows us to perform the following transformation : @xmath45 with @xmath46 a diagonal complex matrix of pure phases .",
    "thus , we can suppress all arbitrary complex phases of @xmath42 coming from ( [ mass matrix ] ) , while @xmath43 remains with arbitrary phases .",
    "we can then find the eigenvalues by the orthogonal transformations @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an arbitrary diagonal complex matrix of pure phases which suppresses the arbitrary phases of @xmath43 .",
    "the quark mixing are given by the ckm matrix defined by @xmath49 since an overall redefinition of the phases has no influence on the magnitude of the ckm matrix elements , we can choose @xmath50 without any loss of generality .",
    "thus , we can represent all the arbitrary weak phases of ( [ mass matrix ] ) with only two parameters , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    in the work of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", the choice of the weak basis plays a special role .",
    "their specific background does not allow for any natural basis and they must fit the sm parameters by some specific configuration of the mass matrix . in our pattern ,",
    "the localization of the higgs field brings about a more natural texture .",
    "we can effectively choose a weak basis where the diagonal elements are decreasing according to the higgs profile , and where the off - diagonal elements are also suppressed by the fermionic overlap .",
    "this leads to the following texture : @xmath53 where , in general , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 in magnitude .",
    "however , the off - diagonal elements can not be much smaller than the diagonal elements . effectively , as most of the down quarks are lighter than the up quarks , we need to have @xmath57 to obtain this difference of masses as well as the ckm matrix .",
    "( another possibility to render the down quarks lighter would be to have @xmath16 ( the yukawa coupling of ( [ yukawa ] ) ) smaller for the down quarks .",
    "however , we see from ( [ ckm ] ) that to have a non - trivial ckm matrix , the matrix elements of @xmath58 and @xmath59 can not be proportional . )",
    "the difference @xmath57 is allowed by the fact that the up - type and the down - type singlets are generated by different five - dimensional fields which can be coupled to the brane in different ways . with this mechanism ,",
    "the elements of @xmath59 are in general smaller than the elements of @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the special feature of the sm quark masses to have @xmath60 while we have @xmath61 and @xmath62 requires for our mechanism to obtain this case with an adequate behavior of the off - diagonal elements of the mass matrices .",
    "this forces us to have the off - diagonal elements of the same magnitude as the diagonal elements .",
    "first of all , we need to run the quark masses to a common scale .",
    "we choose this scale to be @xmath63 , but a further running to a higher scale can be contained in the arbitrary power of the five - dimensional yukawa coupling ( [ scale ] ) and thus plays no role .",
    "we used the running constants @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "the different values of @xmath68 were computed to one loop in qed and three loops in qcd @xcite and are given by @xmath69 for the allowed sm experimental values , we used @xcite @xmath70 where the @xmath71- , @xmath72- and @xmath73-quark masses are the current quark masses estimated in the @xmath74 scheme at a scale @xmath75 gev and the @xmath76- , @xmath77- , @xmath78-quark masses are the running masses in the @xmath74 scheme evaluated at a scale equal to their @xmath74 mass .",
    "the running of the ckm matrix elements is small comparing to their incertitude and , thus , we do not take it in account . from @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath79 .",
    "we used ( [ mass matrix ] ) for the mass matrix with the arbitrary value of @xmath80 , where @xmath40 is a dimensionful parameter .",
    "it means that all parameters are given in units of @xmath40 , which can be chosen according to the theory considered .",
    "this could be probably @xmath81 tev .",
    "one condition on this scale is to have the distances between the branes @xmath82 much bigger than the brane widths , in order to justify the approximation of the exponential function .",
    "( this particular choice of @xmath36 , equal for the matrices @xmath58 and @xmath59 , also means that we implicitly consider different five - dimensional yukawa couplings for the up and the down fields . )    after a couple of attempts , we found for the three brane locations : @xmath83 where the higgs brane is localized at @xmath84 .",
    "for the parameters setting the widths of the zero modes we have @xmath85 this gives the mass matrices @xmath86 when taking in account the running constants @xmath87 ( [ eta ] ) , we obtain the quark masses : @xmath88 this is in the range of values allowed by ( [ smvalues ] ) .",
    "our results ( [ results1 ] ) and ( [ results2 ] ) are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ graph2 ] .",
    "this solution is probably not unique .",
    "furthermore , with the choice of weak phases @xmath89 we find the following ckm matrix : @xmath90 with the strength of _",
    "cp_-violation @xmath91 which agrees with the experimental value @xcite @xmath92 .",
    "we see that we can produce a correct amount of _",
    "cp_-violation with only one extra dimension , as opposed to the situation of @xcite , where only two extra dimensions were found to be adequate @xcite .",
    "one last comment regarding the results ( [ results1 ] ) and ( [ results2 ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath93 one might then argue that the gaussian parts of the wave functions inside the branes could play a role , since the brane width @xmath94 can usually be related with the dispersion coefficient such as @xmath95 .",
    "however this influence should not be an obstacle since it will only give a little bit more suppression which can be compensated by putting the branes closer .",
    "a detailed analysis of the situation depends on the underlying higher - dimensional theory and , thus , must be done during the building of a concrete model . in any case , our study demonstrates compatibility of such models with the quark masses and mixing .",
    "with the set of parameters ( [ results1 ] ) and ( [ results2 ] ) , we see that models with localized fields in extra - dimensional theories could be an explanation for the hierarchies of the sm yukawa couplings .",
    "we see that the particular sm situation of @xmath60 is a non - trivial configuration for the process of producing hierarchy with exponentially small wave functions overlap but is nevertheless compatible with such process . it is encouraging to find a possible way of producing the correct hierarchy in a rather natural way and it should be a motivation to search a full realistic model .",
    "the study of the lepton case represents a challenge for the future .",
    "the relatively large mixing of the lepton sector comparing to the neutrino masses , as well as the possible majorana nature of these particles , must be studied in detail to see whether the ds approach to the hierarchy problem can provide a sufficient explanation .",
