    "galaxy clusters are comprised of dark matter , cluster galaxies , and hot plasma .",
    "when two clusters collide , it is believed that the galaxies and dark matter temporarily dissociate from the hot plasma because the latter is collisional and subject to ram pressure .",
    "eventually , the dark matter of the cluster , the gravitationally dominant component , pulls the hot plasma back into its potential well , and the dissociation disappears .",
    "therefore , in general we have a narrow time - window ( a few gyrs after the core pass - through ) to witness observationally significant offsets between collisional and collisionless constituents of the clusters .",
    "detailed studies of these  dissociative \" mergers ( dawson 2012 ) provide unique opportunities to enhance not only our astrophysical understanding of the cluster formation and evolution , but also our understanding of fundamental physics on the nature of dark matter . because a direct lab detection of dark matter particles may not happen within the current decade , these merging clusters with large offsets among the different cluster constituents are receiving growing attention ( e.g. , springel & farrar 2007 ; randall et al .",
    "2008 ; dawson 2012 ) .    to date",
    ", only a few merging systems are known to possess such large dissociative features ( e.g. , dawson et al .",

    "2011 , bradac et al . 2008",
    "; okabe & umetsu 2008 ; soucail 2012 ) , and only two systems , namely 1e0657 - 56 at @xmath4 ( markevitch et al .",
    "2002 ; hereafter the  bullet cluster \" ) and a520 at @xmath5 ( markevitch et al .",
    "2005 ) , are known to possess prominent x - ray `` bow - shock '' features , which serve as the definite evidence for a recent high - speed collision and allow us to estimate the relatively stable transverse velocity of the collision .",
    "clowe et al . ( 2006 ) showed that the mass distribution of the bullet cluster revealed by weak - lensing closely follows the cluster galaxies , which themselves are offset from the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the observation is claimed as proof of dark matter , and some studies ( e.g. , markevitch et al .",
    "2004 ; randall et al . 2008 ) use the result to constrain an upper limit of the dark matter self - interaction cross - section .",
    "mahdavi et al .",
    "( 2007 ; hereafter m07 ) reported a more puzzling case based on their weak - lensing analysis of a520 with canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) and subaru images .",
    "the mass distribution of m07 generally follows the cluster galaxies as seen in the bullet cluster .",
    "however , what separates a520 from the bullet cluster is the presence of a `` dark core '' , which coincides with the location of the peak of the x - ray emission .",
    "the dark core region does not contain any luminous cluster galaxies unlike the other mass peaks in m07 .",
    "although the initial independent analysis of a520 with subaru images by okabe & umetsu ( 2008 ) did not support the presence of the dark core , their final study carried out with the subset of their data ( taken with the auto guider of the telescope turned on ) agrees with m07 in that their weak lensing data shows the dark peak near the peak of the x - ray emission .",
    "this study of okabe & umetsu ( 2008 ) serves as a good example to illustrate that the investigation of cluster substructures is prone to instrumental systematics such as imperfect point spread function models .",
    "a logical extension of these studies is a follow - up investigation with space - based images , which provide a much higher density of source galaxies . if the dark core had appeared as an `` unfortunate statistical fluke '' due to fortuitous alignment of source galaxies , mass reconstruction with a much higher source density must reduce the probability of this chance alignment and thus the significance of the feature . in jee",
    "( 2012 ; hereafter j12 ) , we presented a _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) weak lensing analysis of a520 and confirmed the results of m07 and okabe & umetsu ( 2008 ) .",
    "both the two - dimensional mass map and the aperture mass results of j12 are consistent with m07 , except for the detection of two additional mass peaks , which were not reported in m07 .",
    "one of the two new peaks ( labeled as p5 in j12 ) resolves one of the questions raised in m07 , who considered the absence of any significant mass peak around this location also discordant with our common light - traces - mass hypothesis along with the presence of the significant mass in the dark core region .",
    "the other new peak ( labeled as p6 in j12 ) is detected @xmath6  kpc south of the dark core and coincides with the spatial distribution of the cluster galaxies .",
    "as for the dark core both j12 and m07 discuss a number of possibilities that may lead to the observation , but neither study could exclusively single out one definite scenario responsible for these observations .",
    "the scenarios considered in j12 and m07 are : 1 ) a possible presence of a background high - redshift ( @xmath7 ) cluster at the location of the dark peak , 2 ) a rejection of cluster galaxies during a complex multi - body collision , 3 ) a filament elongated along the line - of - sight direction , 4 ) self - interacting dark matter , and 5 ) a compact high m / l group .",
    "we reject the first scenario because our spectroscopic survey data do not indicate the presence of a possible @xmath7 cluster at the dark peak , the x - ray emission line is consistent with the a520 redshift , and the dark peak is seen in ground - based weak - lensing , where the mean source redshift is lower than @xmath8 .",
    "scenario 2 is discarded because no numerical simulations have shown that brightest cluster galaxies are ejected during three - body encounter , although it can happen to faint satellite galaxies .",
    "the third possibility is unlikely because the filament must be very thin in such a way that most of the projected mass is confined to the central @xmath9kpc region around the dark peak .",
    "the fourth scenario is highly disfavored because the anticipated collisional cross - section of dark matter by m07 is much higher than the values estimated from the bullet cluster .",
    "the last scenario has not been completely ruled out yet .",
    "however , the implied m / l value of the group is too high to be bracketed by the values found in the literature .",
    "the improved sampling resolution and sensitivity of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) allow for a more efficient coverage of a520 reaching a higher source density in principle .",
    "recently , clowe et al . ( 2012 ; hereafter c12 ) presented the results from their weak lensing analysis of a520 , this time using such acs data .",
    "they reported that no such dark peak is seen in their analysis .",
    "the rest of the weak lensing substructures of c12 closely resemble those of j12 including the aforementioned two new mass peaks of j12 .",
    "although this claim of c12 , if true , may resolve the `` mystery '' reported by j12 , m07 , and okabe & umetsu ( 2008 ) , the discrepancy raises a different kind of puzzle , namely why is the result of the c12 weak lensing study so different from those of three previous independent studies .    to address this issue , we perform an independent weak lensing analysis of a520 using the same acs data used by c12 .",
    "we provide a detailed comparison of the results with those from c12 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the data and our analysis .",
    "correction of instrumental effects is detailed in  3 .",
    "the mass reconstruction is discussed in  4 and mass estimates are presented in  5 .",
    "we compare our results to those of c12 in  6 and examine whether the new observations can constrain the interaction cross - section of dark matter in  6 . throughout this paper",
    "we use @xmath10 for cosmology unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "this gives a plate scale of @xmath11  kpc/@xmath12 at the redshift ( @xmath5 ) of abell 520 .",
    "all the quoted uncertainties are at the 1-@xmath13 ( @xmath14% ) level .",
    "we retrieved the _ hst_/acs images of a520 ( pi : clowe ) from the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) in 2012 july after the new charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) for details . ]",
    "correction of ubeda and anderson ( 2012 ) had become available .",
    "the cluster was observed in the cycle 18 ( 2011 february and april ) and the raw data are severely affected by cti .",
    "the images are comprised of four pointings in f435w , f606w , and f814w to cover the approximately @xmath15 central region of the cluster .",
    "the exposure time per pointing is 4,600 s for f814w whereas it is a factor of two smaller for both f435w and f606w .",
    "a similar exposure time per pointing ( 4,400 s ) was used for the wfpc2 observation ( pi : dalcanton ) of a520 , although the acs image is in general @xmath161.4 magnitude deeper because of its higher ( more than a factor of 3 ) sensitivity . however , around the dark core the wfpc2 image provides comparable depth because the wfpc2 observation was designed in such a way that the footprints overlap substantially in that region , although the acs weak lensing analysis benefits from the improved sampling .",
    "we use the f814w data as the primary data set for the lensing analysis . however , we verify that a parallel weak - lensing analysis with the f606w image gives a consistent result yet with slightly increased noise because of the shallower depth .",
    "we combine the four acs pointings into a single mosaic image , which is used to measure the galaxy shapes ( note that we keep track of the combined psf ) .",
    "as discussed in more detail in  2 , a careful treatment of the impact of the cti is critical .",
    "to investigate this , we created three different versions of mosaic images .",
    "the first mosaic was generated with the flt files processed by the calacs pipeline ( hack et al .",
    "these images are corrected for the bias stripping noise with no cti correction applied .",
    "the second mosaic is made from the flc files also processed by the calacs pipeline , which removes both bias stripping noise and cti trails using the latest 2012 cti model of ubeda and anderson ( 2012 ) .",
    "this latest model was not available to c12 .",
    "finally , for our third mosaic image , we use the pixctecorr script to correct the cti effects as per the 2009 cti model ( anderson & bedin 2010 ) .",
    "this old model is considered inferior to the latest model for the accuracy of the correction in the low - flux regime .",
    "we defer the detailed comparison to [ section_cti_impacts ] .",
    "the image offsets are computed by comparing the coordinates of common astronomical sources .",
    "this process can be easily automated for the image set observed at the same pointing with an accuracy of @xmath17 pixels .",
    "however , the offsets between different pointings are difficult to determine reliably using automated algorithms because the small overlapping areas ( @xmath6 pixels ) and the dense distribution of cosmic rays make only a few objects available for shift estimation .",
    "therefore , we choose to create a separate stack for each pointing as an intermediate step and to use the catalog from the resulting image ( where cosmic rays are removed and fainter sources are available ) to determine accurate offsets between different pointings ( @xmath18 pixel ) .",
    "the final full @xmath19 mosaic is generated by the multidrizzle software ( koekemoer et al .",
    "2002 ) with the lanczos3 drizzling kernel and an output pixel scale of @xmath20 .",
    "the lanczos3 kernel closely approximates the theoretically ideal sinc ( @xmath21 ) interpolation kernel by truncating the oscillation beyond the third pixel from the center . in jee",
    "et al . ( 2007a ) , we demonstrate that this lanczos3 drizzling kernel is superior to the `` square '' kernels in minimizing both aliasing and noise correlation and gives the sharpest psf .",
    "we note that c12 used a square kernel with an output pixel scale of @xmath20 to drizzle the acs images , which may not be optimal for measuring accurate shapes of small galaxies .",
    "the key ingredient in any weak lensing analysis is the accurate measurement of the shapes of the source galaxies .",
    "a number of observational effects prevent us from simply using the observed shapes .",
    "instead we need to characterize these instrumental distortions and correct for them .",
    "in addition to the usual correction for the psf ( both size and anisotropy ) , the analysis of acs data needs to account for the trailing of charge due to cti .",
    "since charge trapping happens every time charges are transferred from one pixel to another , cti is greater for pixels farther from the readout register .",
    "after the trapped charges in one transfer are released , a fraction of them remain trapped during the next transfer .",
    "this cascading effect leads to trails , leading to a change in the shapes of galaxies . both photometry and shape measurements",
    "are affected by cti , although both are sensitive to different species of traps .",
    "although this undesirable artifact happens in every ccd , it is an especially serious concern for space telescopes where the ccds are subject to constant space radiation and the sky background is very low .",
    "the number of defects increases roughly linearly with time , and the a520 data taken in the cycle 18 ( 2011 february and april ) are severely affected by this cti problem .",
    "j12 discussed the potential impact of uncorrected cti in the wfpc2 analysis .",
    "although wfpc2 at the time of the observation of a520 was in orbit longer than acs at the time of the current observation , the much smaller size of the readout distance ( 800 pixels vs. 2048 pixels ) makes the overall impact less severe .",
    "in addition , the direction of the cti trails differs for the three ccds of wfpc2 , which results in a more effective mixing of any residual cti pattern .",
    "we measure the cti utilizing warm pixels and compact cosmic rays present in the same science data ( jee et al . 2009 ; jee et al . 2011 ; j12 ) .",
    "these sub - psf features ( hereafter spfs ) suffer from the charge transfer efficiency degradation but are not affected by the anisotropic psf of the instrument .",
    "hence we can single out cti and perform a statistical analysis of their ellipticity as a function of charge transfer distance and flux .",
    "we quantify the elongation of spfs due to cti using the ellipticity defined as @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the semi - major and -minor axis , respectively .",
    "@xmath27 is the orientation of the ellipse . for the current cti measurement ,",
    "we choose the serial readout direction as our @xmath28-axis and the parallel readout direction as our @xmath29-axsis .",
    "the plot on the left panel of figure  [ fig_cti_ellipticity ] shows the @xmath30 component of the spf ellipticity as a function of a charge transfer distance ; because the @xmath28-axis is defined to be orthogonal to the readout direction , the sign of @xmath30 becomes negative for cti trails .",
    "different colors represent different ranges of flux counts ( after background being subtracted ) .",
    "several features are worth noting in comparison with previous work .",
    "first , the cti is still linear with transfer distance , as was observed in our previous studies ( jee et al .",
    "2009 ; jee et al . 2011 ; hoekstra et al . 2011 ) .",
    "second , even the brightest spfs are severely affected by cti . compared to our 2009 data",
    ", the slope of the spfs at the flux range 2500 - 4000 @xmath31 has increased by more than a factor of two , showing that the farthest ( @xmath32 pixels ) spfs suffer from a net ellipticity distortion of 0.2 whereas it was at the @xmath33 level for the data taken in the year 2009 .",
    "third , the flux - dependence of the slope is more complicated . in jee",
    "et al . ( 2009 ; 2011 ) , we observed that the cti slope becomes more negative for decreasing flux until it sharply turns around at @xmath34 ( see figure 31 of jee et al .",
    "2011 ) , which would affect objects fainter than @xmath35 .",
    "however , the a520 images show that the slope becomes less negative for decreasing flux initially and then suddenly turns around at @xmath36 . at the faintest limit ,",
    "it turns around again , and the cti is mitigatied once more .",
    "anderson & bedin ( 2010 ) developed a so - called pixel - based cti correction method , and their standalone script pixctecorr is publicly available and can be applied to regular flt files .",
    "the results shown in the middle panel of figure  [ fig_cti_ellipticity ] are obtained from these images ( hereafter we refer to this method as the y2009 model ) when we repeat the above experiment .",
    "the y2009 model reduces the cti effects substantially , and the performance is excellent especially in the brightest regime ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the model does under - correct the cti in the intermediate flux range ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "however , the most interesting feature is the behavior of the spfs at the faintest end ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the cti slopes are @xmath40 in this flux range because the model @xmath41 the cti .",
    "this also serves as proof of the cti mitigation at the faint limit first reported in jee et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and later supported by schrabback et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "a new cti correction method has been proposed by ubeda and anderson ( 2012 ) and it is now part of the default stsci pipeline .",
    "this method ( hereafter the y2012 model ) is an important improvement over the earlier method in that it includes both time and temperature dependence .",
    "in addition , ubeda and anderson ( 2012 ) state that the performance in the low flux regime has been significantly improved .",
    "we display the results obtained from this new correction in the right panel of figure  [ fig_cti_ellipticity ] .",
    "it is clear that the undercorrection problems ( e.g. , see the slope for the range @xmath42 in the middle panel ) seen in the old model nicely disappear in this case .",
    "however , unfortunately , the overcorrection problem at the faint limit still remains ( perhaps becoming even slightly worse ) .",
    "nonetheless the performance of this correction is the best and we use the y2012 cti - correction algorithm for our actual weak lensing analysis .",
    "the remaining concern is the treatment of the overcorrection problems at the faint limit .",
    "the flux range @xmath39 corresponds roughly to @xmath43 .",
    "however , this blind conversion is not accurate mainly because galaxy profiles are much less steep than those of the spfs .",
    "thus , any naive attempt to merely correct the ellipticity of these sources at the catalog level will likely fail . as in jee",
    "( 2011 ) , we correct for these residual cti - correction errors by modifying our model psf by treating the distortion of the psf due to cti as an additional convolution .",
    "this assumption should hold better in the current study than in jee et al .",
    "( 2011 ) because most significant cti - effects are already fixed by the pixel - based method ( thus , the residual cti effect on psf can be approximated by slightly stretching the psf ) .",
    "we find that about 15% of our source galaxies need this additional correction .",
    "because the residual correction is small and the ellipticities of these faint galaxies are already down - weighted , the impact due to the imperfection of our residual correction on weak lensing analysis is negligibly small    another method to address the overcorrection would be simply to discard the sources at the faint end that are likely to be over - corrected by the y2012 algorithm .",
    "we verify that our weak - lensing result obtained with this scheme is highly consistent with those from the full catalog , albeit with a slightly higher noise level .",
    "although the psf of acs is small , a careful effort must be made to model and remove the smearing effect of the psf . in particular , when one desires to utilize sources near the 5@xmath13 detection limit and the size of the psf , the complex spatial variation of the acs psf should be fully considered to avoid bias due to the psf anisotropy ( the sizes of these faint sources are comparable to that of the psf ) .",
    "about 10 - 20 high s / n ( @xmath44 ) stars are found in the individual exposures of the a520 data .",
    "since the acs psf is both time- and position - dependent , it is impossible to use this small number of stars to derive a reliable psf model at the location of galaxies across the field .",
    "therefore , we utilize the psf library of jee et al .",
    "( 2007a ) constructed from dense stellar fields .",
    "the psf pattern of acs is repeatable ( jee et al .",
    "2007a ) , and thus can be estimated for each exposure by measuring the shape properties of the stars in the a520 data and comparing them with those from the psf library .",
    "we keep track of the model psfs at the locations of source galaxies in individual exposures to compute the final psf on the stack image .",
    "this requires a rigorous propagation of the image stacking history including offset , rotation , and weight applied to individual exposures .",
    "we refer readers to our previous publication ( e.g. , jee et al .",
    "2011 ) for details .",
    "figure  [ fig_psf_model ] compares the psf ellipticity pattern of the stars and the model psfs in the a520 f814w images , where we measure shears .",
    "the comparison shows that our psf model reasonably mimics the observed psf pattern .",
    "any significant registration error is supposed to create spurious stellar ellipticities not observed in the model .",
    "we do not find any hints of such a large discrepancy .",
    "the residual psf ellipticity rms per component is small ( @xmath45 ) , and thus the impact of the residual anisotropy on shear is negligible .",
    "our ellipticity is defined by @xmath46 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the semi - major and minor axes , respectively is often used in the literature .",
    "one should remember that this so - called polarisation needs to be divided by 2 to obtain an estimate of the shear . ] .",
    "we determine the ellipticity of an object by fitting a psf - convolved elliptical gaussian .    because the elliptical gaussian is not the best representation of real galaxies , it is important to correct for this  underfitting \" ( bernstein 2010 ) together with other shear calibration issues such as the dilution of the signal by noise and spurious sources .",
    "our internal shear calibration utilizing the hubble ultra deep field ( beckwith et al .",
    "2006 ; hudf ) data shows that the average correction factor is @xmath47% .",
    "this average value is greatly influenced by low - surface brightness galaxies at @xmath48 , which require a slightly larger ( @xmath49% on average ) correction factor , but still contain a useful lensing signal . this s / n - dependent correction is often called noise bias ( melchior & voila 2012 ; refregier et al .",
    "2012 ) , and is an important factor affecting cosmic shear results . in this paper , we multiply a s / n - independent average correction factor 1.11 to our galaxy ellipticity .",
    "however , we verify that analysis using a s / n - dependent correction scheme yields virtually indistinguishable weak - lensing results .",
    "note that this multiplicative bias affects the amplitude of the lensing signal , but should not affect features in the mass map . to maximize the s / n of the lensing signal ,",
    "the ellipticity of galaxies must be properly weighted by taking into account both the source ellipticity distribution and measurement errors .",
    "we employ the following simple inverse - variance weighting scheme :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the dispersion of the source ellipticity distribution ( @xmath52 per component for the a520 data ) , and @xmath53 is the @xmath54 galaxy s ellipticity measurement error per component .    for bright galaxies ( f814w@xmath55 )",

    "this gives a total of 447 objects , and we use them to estimate the cluster luminosity .",
    "for the source galaxy sample , we select galaxies between @xmath56 and remove the bright ( f814w@xmath55 ) cluster members . we do not attempt to remove cluster members at f814w@xmath57 because the above color - based selection is not efficient in this regime ( in [ section_redshift ] we demonstrate that in fact the contamination from faint cluster members is negligible at f814w@xmath57 ) .",
    "stars are identified utilizing both half - light radius and shape measurement results . because delta - function - like features should arise for point sources after deconvolution",

    "the most noteworthy difference in the weak lensing results between our current acs and the wfpc2 study is the large shift of the centroid of the dark peak from p3 to p3@xmath103 by @xmath1 .",
    "since this shift is much larger than the centroid uncertainty determined from the bootstrapping experiment ( table  1 ) , it is difficult to attribute the shift to mere shot noise .",
    "here we examine whether the shift originates from a systematic difference between the two source catalogs of acs and wfpc2 .",
    "we first carry out a galaxy - by - galaxy comparison of the two catalogs .",

    "[ fig_ks93_wfpc2_mass ] ]    to examine whether any systematic shape error might be localized near the dark peak we perform a weak lensing mass reconstruction using the shapes of the acs data but based on the source selection in j12 . in our wfpc2 catalog there are more ( less ) source galaxies in the p3 ( p3@xmath103 ) region than in our acs catalog .",
    "thus , the number density distribution of the common source galaxies does not exactly match the source density distribution of the wfpc2 data .",
    "we return to the issue of source density below .",
    "figure  [ fig_ks93_wfpc2_mass ] shows the convergence field obtained from this source catalog using the ks93 method .",
    "interestingly , the location of the dark core now coincides with that of p3 in j12 in this mass reconstruction .",
    "this demonstrates that the shape catalogs based on either wfpc2 or acs data give consistent results when a similar source selection is made .",

    "it is clear that in the wfpc2 catalog the density in the p3 region is much higher than the surrounding area .",
    "this is mainly because the wfpc2 observation was planned in such a way that much deeper imaging is performed in this region ( see also figure 2 of j12 ) .",
    "although we still hold to the claim of j12 that the spatial variation of the source galaxy number density does not cause any spurious substructure , it appears that the centroid of the dark peak is influenced by this large inhomogeneity of the source galaxy distribution .",
    "we suspect that the elongation of the substructure in the dark peak region along the merger axis also facilitates the centroid shift .",
    "this particular shape of the substructure should make its centroid more uncertain along the p3-p3@xmath103 orientation and sensitive to the source density fluctuation near the dark peak region .",
    "the cfht location of the dark peak in m07 is similar to that of j12 , although it is closer to p3@xmath103 by @xmath119 than in j12 .",

    "the current acs selection based on three filters approximately increases the number of the cluster member candidates by @xmath121% ( 295 vs. 474 candidates ) .",
    "most of this increase comes from increasing the number of relatively faint blue cluster member candidates whose f435w - f606w colors are less than @xmath122",
    ". however , this improvement in the cluster member removal has a negligible impact on the weak lensing analysis for the following reasons .",
    "first , the blue cluster member selection is still unreliable even when one uses three broadband photometry .",
    "second , we find that the spatial distribution of these additional blue cluster candidates does not correlate with the substructures .",
    "third , most importantly , our mass reconstruction using the source galaxy catalog where we only remove the red - sequence is very similar to the results presented in figure  [ fig_massmap_contour ] .",
    "it is possible to use the two - dimensional mass map to measure substructure masses , but the results are sensitive to the algorithm used .",
    "more importantly , on small scales the result depends on details such as smoothing scheme , treatment of non - linearity , etc .",
    "also , one can consider fitting halo models ( e.g. , nfw ) to all mass clumps simultaneously .",
    "this is feasible when the substructures are simple and sufficiently massive such as those of the  el gordo \" cluster ( jee et al .",
    "we find that this simultaneous fit becomes unstable when applied to a520 , which consists of at least five mass clumps within the @xmath123  mpc region .",
    "therefore , we report our mass estimates based on the aperture mass densitometry ( fahlman et al . 1994 ; clowe et al . 2000 ) , which provide a more direct estimate of the projected mass by measuring the tangential shear as a function of radius around the position of interest .",
    "the aperture mass densitometry also allows us to take full advantage of the large field of view provided by our ancillary canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) data , which is important for efficiently breaking the so - called mass - sheet degeneracy .",

    "as is done in j12 , we combine the shape catalogs from the cfht and acs images by preferring acs shapes wherever available . the difference in the effective source plane redshift between acs and cfht",
    "is accounted for by scaling up the cfht shears by the amount required for the difference in the redshift .",

    "according to the current selection , the @xmath190-band luminosities of p3 and p4 increase by @xmath206% and @xmath168% , respectively . on the other hand ,",

    ", their results imply a value of @xmath214 for the cluster .",
    "the average asymptotic value for the range in richness is @xmath215 .",
    "sheldon et al . ( 2009 ) examine the m / l as a function of distance from the bcg and their results suggest that within the inner 150 kpc , the mean",
    "m / l is about 40 - 50% of the asymptotic value .",
    "the values listed in table  2 for the luminous substructures are in good agreement with this finding if we consider the m / l values from hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the m / l values of p3 and p3@xmath103 are much higher . compared to the global value @xmath216 in m07 ,",
    "the m / l in p3 is higher by @xmath217 , but value for p3@xmath107 is more than @xmath218 higher .",
    "our acs weak lensing analysis therefore supports the claim of m07 and j12 for the presence of substantial dark mass in this region . in figure",
    "[ fig_ml_comparison ] , we compare the m / l values of the substructures in a520 .",
    "we have compared the results from our weak lensing analysis of acs data to the results from j12 which was based on wfpc2 observations . in this section",
    "we present a more detailed comparison with the results presented in c12 .",
    "we start by noting that the overall large - scale distribution of the c12 mass map is similar to our acs result . however , there are a few differences worthy of further discussion .",
    "the c12 mass map shows some indication of overdensity at the location of p3@xmath103 , but it appears more as an extension of p4 , rather than a definite peak as seen in our mass reconstruction ( figure  [ fig_massmap_contour ] ) .",
    "however , our tests of the cti correction suggest that this may be the main cause of this difference .",
    "c12 also noticed a substructure about @xmath219 north of p4 and labeled it as `` peak 7 '' ( figure 2 of c12 ) .",
    "however , this mass peak does not appear in our mass reconstruction , although there is a weak indication of an overdensity around the location in our mass map .",
    "the m / l values of the substructures are slightly different .",
    "l value of the p3 region ( @xmath220 ) from c12 is lower than the current value ( @xmath221 ) by @xmath188% , although the two error bars marginally overlap .",
    "this happens because 1 ) their aperture mass of p3 is lower than ours by @xmath1615% and 2 ) their gas mass estimate @xmath222 is higher than our value @xmath223 by @xmath1633% .",
    "the error bars of the aperture mass of p3 between c12 and this paper also overlap . nevertheless , because these two results are derived from the same acs data , it is difficult to attribute this 15% difference solely to statistical noise arising from different source galaxy selection .",
    "c12 argue that the main difference in the m / l values between c12 and j12 comes from the discrepancy in the luminosity estimates , claiming that their luminosity estimate around p3 is a factor of two higher than that of j12 because their cluster member selection based on three acs filters includes more blue cluster members that j12 might have missed .",
    "however , as already mentioned in [ section_luminosity ] , we find that the factor - of - two discrepancy in luminosity arises mainly from the difference in the passband and the omission of the due @xmath197-correction",
    ". using the c12 selection criteria , we estimate @xmath224 in the rest - frame @xmath190 , which is only @xmath206% higher than the estimate of j12 . ignoring the @xmath197-correction",
    ", we obtain @xmath225 in the rest - frame f814w , which is in good agreement with the estimate of c12 .",
    "c12 presented their bootstrap resampling experiments and claimed that any substructure resembling the dark peak only happens in @xmath162% of the total realizations .",
    "c12 speculated on the possibility that some chance alignment of the sources might have led to the detection in previous studies .",
    "however , the source number density in j12 data is significantly higher than that of m07 and okabe & umetsu ( 2008 ) .",
    "furthermore , our acs study is based on a higher source density compared to c12 and we confirm the presence of an overdensity .",
    "a caveat is that c12 focused on the location of the dark peak defined in j12 , which is @xmath1 offset from the current centroid .",
    "c12 might have obtained different results if they had examined the region near p3@xmath107 . as stated in [ section_mass_reconstruction ] ,",
    "our bootstrapping test shows that the dark peak p4@xmath103 appears @xmath226% of the random realizations at the @xmath114 significance .",
    "we note that similar levels of m / l and mass discrepancy are present in other substructures as well .",
    "for instance , c12 quotes an aperture mass of @xmath227 for p4 whereas we estimate @xmath228 .",
    "this @xmath229 difference for p4 is in fact larger than the contrast in p3 .",
    "figure  [ fig_mass_comparison ] shows the comparison for the rest of the substructures .",
    "the error bars of c12 are on average a factor of two larger than ours , and here we provide detailed analysis of the discrepancy . c12 present analytic expression for estimating the @xmath230 statistic as follows : @xmath231 where @xmath232 is the effective number of sources per logarithmic bin .",
    "the summation is carried out over these logarithmic bins .",
    "note that we correct for the typographical error in c12 , where the exponent of the @xmath233 term should have been two ( as above ) not one . the equation is an approximation because 1 ) the integral in the @xmath230 statistic is treated as summation , 2 ) the aperture mass is estimated using @xmath234 rather than @xmath230 , and 3 ) the nonlinearity @xmath116 is ignored .",
    "we compare the results of this analytic error propagation with those obtained from our direct monte - carlo analysis and find that the approximation overestimates the errors by @xmath235% for the @xmath112  kpc aperture mass given the same source density .",
    "the remaining discrepancy comes from the difference in the number density of source galaxies .",
    "the number density in c12 is 56 per sq .",
    "arcmin whereas it is 109 per sq .",
    "arcmin in this study .",
    "de - weighting low s /",
    "n galaxies being considered , the rms shear of c12 is @xmath236% higher than ours ( [ section_source_selection ] ) .",
    "we find that the small source galaxy density of c12 is rather surprising because the typical source density in our previous weak lensing studies with hst / acs images comfortably exceeds @xmath237 per sq .",
    "arcmin whenever the number of orbits per pointing is two or higher as in the current a520 data ( jee et al .",
    "2005a ; 2005b ; 2006 ; 2007 ; 2011 ; dawson et al .",
    "2012 ) . also , even for acs images with the depth of a single orbit , our typical number density of usable galaxies is above @xmath238 per sq .",
    "arcmin ( jee et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the source number density also depends on shape measurement and image reduction method .",
    "it is possible that the c12 implementation of ksb together with the use of the square drizzling kernel gives a smaller number of usable galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , schrabback et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who also use a ksb technique , still quote @xmath1676 galaxies per sq .",
    "arcmin from their analysis of the cosmos data , where the mean number of orbits per pointing is about one .",
    "finally , we carry out a catalog - level comparison between this study and c12 .",
    "c12 kindly agreed to exchange each team s shape catalogs to enable a detailed comparison .",
    "the total number of sources in c12 is 2,507 whereas it is 4,788 in this study . by looking for pairs within the distance of @xmath239",
    ", we identify 2,148 common objects between the two source catalogs .",
    "one of the most basic sanity checks is to compare ellipticities of identical sources , and we display the results in figure  [ fig_e_com_with_c12 ] . because the shape catalog provided by c12 already includes their shear calibration , we also apply our independent ( determined from image simulation ) shear calibration to our source ellipticity to enable a fair comparison .",
    "figure  [ fig_e_com_with_c12 ] shows that there is no major shear calibration difference .",
    "the mean slope is consistent with unity .",
    "having found no major systematic difference at least in global shear calibration between the two studies , we compare mass reconstruction results obtained from the common 2,148 sources .",
    "we use the fiatmap code without the nonlinear updating @xmath116 because this may amplify the difference and hamper a fair assessment of the difference .",
    "figure  [ fig_map_com_with_c12 ] shows the comparison .",
    "it is clear that our mass map created with the c12 shape ( middle ) shows the mass overdensity at p3@xmath103 .",
    "this result is slightly different from figure 2 of c12 , where the authors perform the mass reconstruction using the combined shapes from hst and magellan . their hst only mass reconstruction is presented in the right panel of figure 6 in c12 , which shows more mass in the dark peak region and",
    "hence is more similar to our mass map created with the c12 shapes ( middle panel of figure  [ fig_map_com_with_c12 ] ) .",
    "our bootstrap experiment with the c12 weak - lensing catalog shows that a significance mass is found in the dark peak region for their weak - lensing data ( figure  [ fig_sig_darkpeak ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the c12 mass map supports the presence of the significant mass in the dark peak region in a520 , although the slightly weaker significance might make the overdensity appear as an extension of p4 rather than a separate peak .        ]",
    "remember that the above comparison is limited to the common sources found in both the current and c12 studies .",
    "thus , an important question is how much the source galaxies not used by c12 ( but included in our study ) affect the results . in figure",
    "[ fig_mass_only_in_j13 ] , we present the mass reconstruction from these sources . note that this is a completely independent mass map .",
    "the result is similar to the one presented in figure  [ fig_map_com_with_c12 ] .",
    "we can see the same substructures ( including the dark peak ) in this version .",
    "this illustrates that the faint galaxies discarded by c12 but included in the current study contains significant lensing signals .",
    "in addition , the comparison verifies that the dark peak in a520 is not caused by any potential systematic shape errors in the low s / n galaxies .",
    "our acs weak lensing analysis supports the finding of m07 and j12 of a significant amount of dark matter in a520 at a location where there are few luminous cluster galaxies . as in j12",
    "we identify a peak , but its position has shifted ( as explained in  4.3 ) and now coincides well with the peak in the x - ray emission .",
    "l value within the r=150 kpc aperture of this new centroid is estimated to be @xmath240 after the gas mass is subtracted .",
    "this value is much larger than what is typically observed in clusters and either points to a pile - up of dark matter or a reduction in cluster galaxies in that region .",
    "m07 and j12 discussed a number of scenarios , and readers are referred to these two papers for details .    here",
    "we revisit the subject of collisional dark matter as a potential origin of this dark substructure .",
    "our motivation is not that the current acs analysis result favors this scenario , but that it is worth investigating it given the updated centroid and substructure properties .",
    "we do note that the new location of the dark peak is in better agreement with the densest part of the x - ray emission and the morphology of this substructure is extended along the merger axis toward p2 , which may support the collisional dark - matter hypothesis for the nature of the substructure .",
    "m07 assumed a toy model , where peaks 1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 each contributed @xmath241% of the total mass observed in the central dark peak .",
    "thus , the model assumes that the chance of dark matter scatter per particle during this encounter is 1 in 4 or    @xmath242    where @xmath243 is the effective scattering depth viewed by a particle moving along the merger axis .",
    "m07 used the mass of p3 to estimate this effective depth , and obtained @xmath244 , which is about 4 @xmath13 higher than the @xmath245 constraint from the bullet cluster ( markevitch et al .",
    "2003 ; randall et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we revise the m07 model as follows .",
    "we decompose the mass of the dark peak into the contributions from the p2 and p4 halos , the gas mass , the dark matter associated with the cluster galaxies found within the @xmath112kpc aperture , and the excess dark matter due to self - interaction . on the other hand , m07 considered the possibility that the entire mass of the dark peak originates from self - interaction .",
    "our acs mass reconstruction indicates that the overall pre - merger cluster mass distribution might be approximately bimodal , dominated by two massive halos ( p2 and p4 ) when we hypothesize that the dark peak in the center is produced after the collision .",
    "we estimate the contribution from the wings of these two halos by assuming an nfw profile with a scale radius of 100 kpc .",
    "the second parameters of the nfw model are determined by the lensing masses within the @xmath112 kpc aperture centered on each halo . the total contribution to the p3@xmath103 mass",
    "is determined to be @xmath246 with p2 and p4 providing @xmath247 and @xmath248 , respectively . using the cauchy - schwarts inequality ,",
    "we obtain a generous upper limit of @xmath249 for the plasma mass within the @xmath112kpc radius of p3@xmath103 .",
    "the @xmath191-band luminosity of @xmath250 is converted to @xmath251 using the average m / l of the rest of the subclusters , and we assume this to represent the dark matter mass associated with the few cluster galaxies around the region .",
    "then , the net excess mass attributed to the collisional deposit becomes @xmath252 .",
    "now the most uncertain part of this scenario is how this excess dark matter is contributed by the subclusters of a520 , and this dominates our uncertainty in the estimation of the collisional cross - section .",
    "if we assume p2 and p4 contribute equally to this excess mass through dark matter self - interaction , the mass loss fraction for each substructure is @xmath253% . the lower limit of the scattering depth @xmath243 is the surface mass density of p2 or p4 before the mass loss ( we assume spherical symmetry ) .",
    "in this case , we obtain @xmath254 by averaging the surface mass density of p2 and p4 and multiplying the result by 1.13",
    ". then , from the scattering probability of @xmath253% we estimate @xmath255 .",
    "this value does not violate the bullet cluster estimate @xmath256 of markevitch et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . of course ,",
    "the required cross - section decreases if we assume that the scattering depth is higher than the adopted value .",
    "this would happen if the dark matter particles in p4 have passed through more than p2 before it arrived at the current observed location .",
    "in fact , the location of the bow - shock feature indicates that p4 may correspond to the `` bullet '' of the bullet cluster and have experienced the most acceleration , which implies that the other gravitational potential may have been deeper than that of p2 .",
    "if we assume that p4 passed through p1 , p2 , and p5 on its way to the current location , the scattering depth increases to @xmath257 , which gives a cross - section @xmath258 .    although the above constraint on the dark matter cross - section is based on simplistic assumptions of the unobserved pre - merger configuration , the result is interesting because it shows that the current observation of a520 may be explained by self - interaction of dark matter without creating any serious tension with previous values . tighter constraints may become possible if the cluster is followed up with detailed numerical studies",
    "we have presented a re - analysis of hst / acs images of a520 .",
    "our acs weak lensing study confirm the presence of a region of very high mass - to - light ratio , first reported in m07 with cfht data and subsequently supported by obake & umetsu ( 2008 ) and j12 with subaru and wfpc2 data , respectively .",
    "we are able to reproduce the results from j12 when we match the selection of our acs weak lensing catalog to that of the wfpc2 analysis , but find no clear peak at the location where they reported one .",
    "our detailed comparison suggest that this is caused by a variation in the source number density , which leads to additional systematic noise in the mass map .",
    "the acs analysis shows less variation , owing in part to the overall higher number density , and thus should be more reliable .",
    "the analysis presented here indicates a peak that is shifted by @xmath259 compared to j12 .",
    "its position now coincides well with the location of the peak of the x - ray emission .",
    "our mass reconstruction compares well with that of c12 , although we identify a number of differences .",
    "in particular , c12 do not identify such a clear peak , although we note an extension of p4 in their map towards p3@xmath107 .",
    "a comparison of cti correction algorithms , including one used by c12 , suggest that the density contrast at the location of p3@xmath107 is affected by cti ( see figure  [ fig_cti_mass_reconstruction ] ) .",
    "we use the latest algorithm from ubeda & anderson ( 2012 ) which performs best as demonstrated in figure  [ fig_cti_ellipticity ] . note that this cti correction method was not available to c12 .",
    "our shape measurement analysis is able to reach a source number density of @xmath0 arcmin@xmath260 , which is considerably higher than the @xmath58 arcmin@xmath260 used by c12 .",
    "this may be explained by differences in the reduction of acs data and how measurements in the different filters are combined .",
    "the three - filter acs data allow for an improved membership determination which increases the luminosity by @xmath261 compared to j12 .",
    "we find that our luminosity estimates are consistent with c12 when we compare to the same band .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios ( after subtracting the x - ray gas mass ) of the dark peak using the old and new centroids are @xmath262 and @xmath263 , respectively ( in the rest - frame @xmath190-band , @xmath264 and @xmath265 , respectively ) .",
    "our @xmath266 test shows that the constant mass - to - light ratio hypothesis is rejected at least at the @xmath267 level .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio is therefore much higher than is typically observed in clusters and could be due to a reduction in cluster galaxies or an increase in the amount of dark matter in that region .",
    "although we still can not single out a scenario that explains the observations , we revisit the case of collisional dark matter . with the updated substructure properties and consideration of other physical factors for the contribution to the dark peak mass , we find that the net excess mass of the dark peak region can be explained with a more conventional range of dark matter self - interacting cross - section @xmath268 , where the uncertainty is dominated by unknown scattering depth along the merger axis .",
    "this range is consistent with the results obtained from the bullet cluster .",
    "detailed numerical simulations must be carried out to draw more physically meaningful constraints from the current a520 observation .",
    "nevertheless , our analytic study hints at the possibility that a520 can be used to investigate the lower limit of the self - interacting dark matter .",

    "<S> arcmin , which improves both resolution and significance of the mass reconstruction compared to a previous study based on wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images . </S>",
    "<S> we take care in removing instrumental effects such as the trailing of charge due to radiation damage of the acs detector and the position - dependent point spread function ( psf ) . </S>",
    "<S> this new acs analysis confirms the previous claims that a substantial amount of dark mass is present between two luminous subclusters . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the distribution of cluster galaxies and observe very little light at this location . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the centroid of the dark peak in the current acs analysis is offset to the southwest by @xmath1 with respect to the centroid from the wfpc2 analysis . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this new centroid is in better spatial agreement with the location where the x - ray emission is strongest , and the mass - to - light ratio estimated with this centroid is much higher ( @xmath2 ) than the previous value ; the aperture mass based on the wfpc2 centroid provides a slightly lower , but consistent mass . although we can not provide a definite explanation for the presence of the dark peak , we discuss a revised scenario , wherein dark matter with a more conventional range ( @xmath3 ) of self - interacting cross - section can lead to the detection of this dark substructure . </S>",
    "<S> if supported by detailed numerical simulations , this hypothesis opens up the possibility that the a520 system can be used to establish a lower limit of the self - interacting cross - section of dark matter . </S>"
