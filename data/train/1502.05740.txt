    "* ) , red - giants  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the motivation behind our work is that , as the number of putative observations grows , more simulations are needed to interpret the wealth of observational data .",
    "modeling was pioneered by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these studies were first in pointing out that , for the most likely scenario of the disruption of a main - sequence star by a @xmath3 an uv / x - ray flare followed by a @xmath0 decay in luminosity should be expected .",
    "the flare and decay are produced by the accretion of bound stellar debris returning to the . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath0 decay was singled - out as a ubiquitous signature for the presence of massive .",
    "subsequent studies have incorporated detailed micro - physics  @xcite , considered a wider variety of stellar objects , such as white - dwarfs and red - giants  @xcite , covered longer dynamical times  @xcite , and included better descriptions of gravity for ultra - close encounters  @xcite .",
    "a challenging aspect of studies is modeling the formation of the accretion disk  @xcite .",
    "the complication arises because , in canonical , the time between the disruption of the star and the formation of the accretion disk amounts to several orbital periods of the stellar debris in highly eccentric orbits .",
    "this translates into years for a solar - type star disrupted by a @xmath4 for reference , numerical simulations in these cases cover at most a few tens of hours .",
    "recent papers have addressed the circularization of the returning debris with a variety of methods .",
    "@xcite found that the debris circularizes at a larger radius than previously thought , and that the accumulation of mass in the ensuing ring is fairly slow . @xcite",
    "considered the self - intersection of thin post - disruption streams for an ensemble of events and concluded that streams _ typically _ self - intersect at large distances from the leading to a long viscous time , hence a long delay before the onset of rapid accretion .",
    "@xcite and @xcite pointed out the importance of cooling on the rate of circularization of the debris , concluding that efficient cooling leads to very long circularization time scales , hence a delay in the onset of accretion .",
    "the picture emerging from the studies is that , although accretion could be prompt under the right conditions , it is likely that the onset of accretion is delayed by an appreciable amount of time , perhaps of order a year .",
    "our study introduces a new class of , for which a puffed disk or torus forms promptly after disruption .",
    "furthermore , the accretes at a steady and highly super - eddington rate of about @xmath5 for a few days .",
    "this highly super - eddington rate resembles those found by  @xcite .",
    "our involve ultra - close encounters between low mass ( @xmath6 ) stars and a @xmath7 . with intermediate mass , but larger separation encounters , have been also studied by  @xcite .",
    "our simulations are in a regime where accounting for full general relativistic effects is needed , including those from the spin of the in these ultra - close encounters , the star is effectively disrupted as it arrives at periapsis , with the tidal debris plunging into the almost instantaneously ( on the timescale of one orbital period ) .",
    "moreover , given the extreme proximity of the debris to the general relativistic precession is very efficient in circularizing stellar material to form an expanding torus .",
    "the inner material in the torus spirals into the and is accreted at a constant rate until the supply of bound debris is exhausted .",
    "a star of mass @xmath8 and radius @xmath9 approaching a of mass @xmath10 , likely in a highly eccentric or parabolic orbit  @xcite , will be disrupted by tidal forces if it wanders within a distance to the @xmath11 called the _",
    "tidal radius_. it is customary to characterize the strength of a encounter by its _ penetration factor _ @xmath12 , which is defined as @xmath13 with @xmath14 the periapsis distance . the fourth length scale in the problem is the gravitational radius @xmath15 , which is equal to half the horizon radius for a non - spinning and the full horizon radius for a maximally rotating .",
    "given @xmath16 and @xmath17 , it is useful to identify the domain of astrophysical relevance of  . in the @xmath12",
    "_ vs _ @xmath10 plane , this domain is the triangle shown in figure  [ fig : beta ] , whose demarcations are obtained by interpreting @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta ] ) as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "the base of the triangle is @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath19 . below this line ( @xmath20 )",
    "there is no disruption .",
    "the left side of the triangle is the line obtained by setting @xmath21 ; that is , @xmath22 to the left of this line ( @xmath23 ) lie very close encounters where _ the enters the star _ in the process of disrupting it .",
    "this process has many similarities to the high - speed collisions of stellar - mass and red giants as studied by @xcite .",
    "finally , the right side of the triangle is the line when @xmath24 ; that is , @xmath25 to the right of this line ( @xmath26 ) are events where the _ star enters the _ before it is disrupted .    according to figure  [ fig : beta ] , for a solar - type star ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , the maximum mass to disrupt the star is @xmath29 . moreover ,",
    "the maximum penetration factor with disruption is @xmath30 , which involves a @xmath31 .",
    "the edges of the triangle of astrophysical relevance are , of course , not sharp due to variations in the definition of of relevant length scales arising from the spin of the , the space - time curvature in the neighborhood of the and the internal structure of the star .",
    "after disruption , the receding debris spreads , with roughly half of the material remaining bound to the the most bound material has specific binding energy given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the spread of the debris with @xmath34 a deformation factor , and @xmath35 = \\frac{r_t}{\\beta } f(\\beta , n)\\,\\ ] ] is the distance to the hole when the spread in specific binding energy of the debris freezes - in . in the original estimates  @xcite , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , and thus @xmath38 .",

    "the sign denotes whether the spin of the is aligned ( plus ) or anti - aligned ( minus ) with the orbital angular momentum of the star .",
    "the disruptions involve main - sequence stars injected in parabolic orbits with masses @xmath61 and @xmath62 , modeled as polytropes with equation of state @xmath63 and @xmath64 . during the evolution , we use a gamma - law equation of state @xmath65 .",
    "table  [ table : parms ] provides the parameters of the simulations : the penetration factor @xmath12 , the spin parameter @xmath66 , and the mass of the star @xmath8 .",
    "the simulations were carried out with our maya code and fully account for general relativistic effects .",
    "this code was also used in our previous general relativistic study  @xcite .",
    "the maya code is 4th order accurate in solving the einstein equations and 2nd order in the hydrodynamics equations .",
    "the general convergence of the code is slightly above 2nd order .",
    "we employ nine levels of mesh refinements .",

    "although the value of @xmath14 suggests that the star could potentially swing by the without the entering the star , the combination of large @xmath12 and general relativistic effects produce an outcome dramatically different from the situations with @xmath75 and @xmath76 mass ( next section ) .    with @xmath77 and intermediate mass , the star will be effectively disrupted and stretched to a few times its original size by the time it reaches periapsis passage .",
    "a deformation factor @xmath78 was found to be common in our simulations .",
    "therefore , from eqs .",

    "we focus this discussion chiefly on the accretion rates onto the figure  [ fig : mass - effect ] shows the accretion rates of tidal debris through the horizon .",
    "the time axis is such that @xmath87 s denotes periapsis passage .",
    "three distinct accretion epochs or stages are identifiable in most of the cases .",
    "the first phase is a narrow spike or flare in the accretion rate .",
    "the spike is due to the portion of the stellar debris that immediately plunges into the an estimate of this accretion rate is given by @xmath88 where we have used @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the values for @xmath92 reported in table  [ table : parms ] .",
    "after the accretion flare there is a decay phase , which for a non - spinning ( see top panel in figure  [ fig : mass - effect ] ) loosely resembles a power - law decay .",
    "the duration of this decay seems to depend on the spin of the and the penetration factor @xmath12 .    finally , as new material returns to the it circularizes and forms an accretion torus on a timescale of @xmath93  @xcite , with the accretion eventually reaching steady state at about @xmath94 , as noted in the last column of table  [ table : parms ] .",
    "the steady state accretion will cease when the mass supply from the bound debris is depleted .     grouped by the spin parameter of the , with @xmath95 and 0.65 corresponding to panels a , b and c , respectively .",

    "to illustrate the effect of the mass of the star , panels a , b and c in figure  [ fig : mass - effect ] show the accretion rate for @xmath99 , grouping the cases with the same spin parameter .",
    "since the accretion rate seems to be insensitive to the mass of the star , we will focus on the @xmath96 star given that we have a wider variety of simulations for this star .    in figure",

    "interestingly , the case with a counter - rotating orbit ( i.e. spin anti - aligned with the orbital angular momentum ) yields the largest peak accretion rate . for the @xmath100 simulations , the post - flare accretion rate depends on the spin magnitude but not its orientation , which is consistent with similar findings for the steady - state , subsonic accretion onto a moving  @xcite .",
    "the late - time accretion rate seems to increase with the spin of the another difference between the @xmath102 and the @xmath60 cases is that for the latter , the time scale for flare decay is shorter ; that is , the late constant accretion phase , which signals the formation of the torus , is reached after a couple of hundred seconds .",
    "the corresponding @xmath101 cases show that the spin of the does not play a role in determining the late - time , constant accretion rate . furthermore , as with the @xmath97 cases with spinning , the constant accretion phase is reached within a few hundred seconds . for both the @xmath100 and @xmath101 cases ,",
    "the late - time accretion rate is @xmath2 .    in summary",
    ", we found that the accretion rate is not very sensitive to @xmath8 , and that the rate reached during the flare depends on both @xmath103 and @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , the late accretion rate for @xmath104 is not sensitive to the spin of the , and for both penetration factors is approximately @xmath105 . with the exception of the cases with @xmath97 and @xmath106 ( panels a and c in figure  [ fig : mass - effect ] ) ,",

    "self - intersection of debris and subsequent formation of the accretion torus are evident .",
    "the increase in temperature and entropy as a result of shocks due to self - intersection of material is also evident .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : massdistribution ] shows histograms of the mass per unit binding energy as a function of binding energy for the same case and times as in figure  [ fig : composite_10 ] .",
    "it is evident that @xmath108 is not flat , as is required to achieve the @xmath0 power - law decay .",
    "@xcite were first to suggest a tidal compression perpendicular to the orbital plane @xmath109 @xmath110 that would yield an increase in the central density and temperature of the star @xmath109 @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "we do not observe such extreme compression . as mentioned before",
    ", the star arrives at periapsis effectively disrupted , with its central density decaying and undergoing only a mild compression , adequately handled with the resolution used in our simulations .",

    "these involve ultra - close encounters with a @xmath113 .",
    "the accretion rates are highly super - eddington .",
    "additionally , there is no evidence of a @xmath0 decay in the accretion rate .",
    "this is likely due the strong influence of general relativistic effects in these ultra - close encounters .",

    "the should be able to accrete the majority of the bound tidal debris in just a few days .",
    "a word of caution is needed regarding the accretion rate quotes in this study .",
    "our simulations did not include effects from radiation , which could potentially decrease the rates .",
    "however , it is not likely that radiation effects would diminish the rates enough to make them sub - eddington , since the eddington rate in these situations is @xmath114 ( assuming 10% efficiency ) .    in a subsequent study",
    ", we will expand the parameter space of our simulations and investigate the emission properties of the tidal debris .",
    "it will be important to investigate further the role of shocks in heating and circularizing the debris as well as the overall role of cooling effects .",
