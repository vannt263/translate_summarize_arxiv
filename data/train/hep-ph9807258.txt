    "the 1995 data from the na50 collaboration @xcite show an anomalous @xmath1 suppression , i.e. a suppression larger than the one expected in a nuclear absorption model .",
    "this model describes the @xmath1 suppression both in proton - nucleus interactions and in nucleus - nucleus interactions with a light projectile @xcite . following the original proposal of @xcite ,",
    "the anomalous @xmath1 suppression has been interpreted as a signal of a deconfining phase transition @xcite . however , an explanation by a more conventional mechanism , namely , the interaction of the @xmath1 ( or the @xmath6 pair ) with comovers , is also possible @xcite .",
    "a very spectacular feature of the 1996 data by the same collaboration @xcite , is the presence of a break in the ratio @xmath7 of @xmath1 over drell - yan ( @xmath8 ) cross - sections at @xmath9 55 gev .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that this break is a signal of deconfinement  although there is no general consensus on this point @xcite .",
    "it is , however , fully recognized that a break in the @xmath1 cross - section would rule out any conventional model , such as the one based on comover interaction .",
    "( other approaches to @xmath1 suppression can be found in @xcite . )    at present , the evidence for this break is weakened by the presence of fluctuations in the ratio @xmath7 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 13e ] ) for a precise definition ) at large values of @xmath0 @xcite , which are generally regarded as spurious .",
    "also , it is necessary to assess whether this break , if confirmed , is due to a genuine break in the @xmath1 cross - section or rather to fluctuations in the @xmath1 and @xmath8 ones . of course , a definitive answer to these questions can only come from data .",
    "however , in view of the interest of the subject , it is important to examine the available data in a theoretical framework in order to gain some insight on these questions , while waiting for a complete analysis of the 1996 na50 data , and above all , for the 1998 results .",
    "the aim of the present work is to perform such an analysis in the framework of a model based on nuclear absorption plus comover interaction .",
    "this work is a continuation of the one in ref .",
    "we use the same formalism and the same values of the parameters which were determined in @xcite from the best fit to the ratio @xmath7 in @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath2 collisions .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we describe the model . in section 3",
    "we compute the @xmath0 distributions of minimum bias , @xmath8 and @xmath1 , and compare them with available data . in section 4",
    "we compute the ratio @xmath7 and compare it with the na50 data . in section 5",
    "we compute the @xmath0 dependence of the average @xmath12 of the @xmath1 and compare it with recent na50 data .",
    "section 6 contains our conclusions and prospects at higher energies .",
    "our model is formulated in a conventional framework @xcite based on two different mechanisms of @xmath1 suppression : nuclear absorption of the pre - resonant @xmath6 pair with nucleons of the colliding nuclei and absorption by comoving partons or hadrons produced in the collision . for completeness",
    "we recall its main ingredients :    5 truemm    in nucleus - nucleus collisions , the survival probability of the @xmath1 at impact parameter @xmath13 and transverse position @xmath14 is given by @xcite s^abs(b , s ) = [ 1 - ( - a  t_a(s )  _ abs ) ] [ 1 - ( - bt_b(b - s )  _ abs ) ] _",

    "note that @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "5 truemm    this absorption is due to the interaction of the @xmath6 pair ( or of the @xmath1 itself ) in the dense medium produced in a nucleus - nucleus collision  which results in the production of a @xmath21 pair .",
    "the @xmath1 survival probability is given by @xcite s^co(b , s ) =  .",
    "[ 2e ] here @xmath22 is the initial density of comovers per unit transverse area @xmath23 and per unit rapidity at impact parameter @xmath13 , and @xmath24 is the corresponding freeze - out density . in order to have a smooth onset of the comovers , it is natural to take for @xmath24 the density of hadrons per unit rapidity in a @xmath25 collision , i.e. @xmath26\\ dn^-/dy|_{y^ * = 0 } = 1.15 \\ { \\rm fm}^{-2}$ ] .",
    "this coincides with the value introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . with this choice of @xmath24 , the @xmath27-function in eq .",

    "( [ 2e ] ) is the result of an integration in the proper time @xmath29 from the initial time to freeze - out time .",
    "( one assumes @xcite a decrease of densities with proper time in @xmath30 . )",
    "a large contribution to this integral comes from the few first fm / c after the collision  where the system is in a pre - hadronic stage .",

    "the drell - yan cross - section ( obtained from ( [ 3e ] ) with @xmath35 ) is proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "the cross - section for minimum bias ( @xmath37 ) events is given by [ 5e ] _ ab ( b ) = 1 -  , with @xmath38 .    in order to compute these cross - sections",
    "we need to know the comover density @xmath22 in the na50 dimuon spectrometer . moreover ,",
    "comparison with experiment requires to compute the above cross - section at a given transverse energy @xmath0  measured in the na50 calorimeter .",
    "this requires the knowledge of the @xmath39 correlation function @xmath40 . in the following we proceed to calculate these two quantities .",
    "5 truemm    it is commonly assumed in the literature that the density of comovers is proportional to that of participating ( or wounded ) nucleons @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called wounded nucleon model ( wnm ; for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "in asymmetric systems and , in particular , in @xmath10 collisions , this model provides a reasonable description of the data but only for the average multiplicity  or at negative rapidities , close to the maximum of the rapidity distribution . for symmetric @xmath41 collisions , the model seems to be valid in a broader rapidity range .",
    "( this can be understood from the arguments in ref .",
    "@xcite ; see p. 26 . )",
    "however , for central @xmath2 collisions ( and also for other central nucleus - nucleus collisions at sps ) there is experimental evidence of a violation of this scaling law at mid - rapidities @xcite .",
    "moreover , models such as the dual parton model ( dpm ) @xcite , in which unitarity is fully implemented , contain an extra term proportional to the average number of collisions .",
    "this term is small at present energies but its relative size increases with energy .",
    "moreover , it contributes mostly at mid - rapidities .",
    "the origin of this term is the following . in dpm one",
    "has both baryonic strings of type diquark - quark and bosonic ones of type @xmath42-@xmath43 .",
    "the latter contribute mainly at mid - rapidities . since the number of diquarks available is equal to the number of participating nucleons , the number of baryonic strings is equal to the number of participants . on the other hand ,",
    "the total number of strings is proportional to the number of collisions .",
    "therefore , the number of @xmath42-@xmath43 strings increases , with increasing centrality , much faster than the number of participants .",
    "the wnm is obtained from dpm by neglecting the contribution of the @xmath42-@xmath43 strings .    in the following calculations",
    "we will use the density of comovers given by dpm .",

    "experimentally , it is indeed found to be close to a straight line but shows a clear concavity . in dpm",
    "this correlation has a concavity due to the contribution of the @xmath42-@xmath43 strings .",

    "it turns out that this is not the case and , therefore , a more accurate description of the @xmath62 correlation is needed .",
    "the failure of the dpm at low @xmath5 can be attributed to the effect of the intra - nuclear cascade , which is not included in ( [ 6e ] ) .",
    "this well known phenomenon consists in the production of extra particles in the fragmentation regions of the two colliding nuclei due to the rescattering of slow secondaries ( in the rest frames of the two nuclei ) with spectator nucleons .",
    "obviously this effect has to vanish for central collisions when no spectator nucleons are left .",
    "it is also absent at mid - rapidities . however , the rapidity region of the @xmath5 calorimeter @xmath65 is affected by the intra - nuclear cascade ( which is known to have an extension of about 1.5 rapidity units ) . in order to incorporate the intra - nuclear cascade in a phenomenological way",

    "moreover , there is a significant disagreement both with dpm and wnm at @xmath87 gev which was not present when comparing with the 1995 data .",
    "there is also a significant difference in shape between dpm and wnm .",

    "we turn next to the @xmath5 distribution of the @xmath1 .",
    "we have computed it using @xmath90 mb , @xmath91 mb .",
    "the result of our calculation is compared with the 1995 data @xcite of the na50 collaboration in fig .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is reasonable .",
    "however the data seem to decrease slightly faster than the theoretical curve .",
    "note that these data show no break in the @xmath1 cross - section at any value of @xmath5 .",
    "5 shows also the @xmath5 distribution obtained with nuclear absorption alone ( @xmath92 mb ) both for dpm ( eq .",
    "( @xmath75 ) ) and for the wnm .",
    "we see that the shape of the @xmath5 distribution is very sensitive to the effect of the comovers .",
    "thus , a slightly steeper decrease of the @xmath1 cross - section , if confirmed , could possibly be obtained with a small increase in the absorption parameters .",
    "( the constraint on these parameters coming from the @xmath11 data is now significantly smaller due to an increase by a factor 2.8 of the statistical errors ; see section 6 . )",
    "note also that , with nuclear absorption alone , the wnm has a faster increase with @xmath5 than the dpm",
    ". therefore the extra @xmath1 suppression required in order to reproduce a given shape of the @xmath1 distribution , must be considerably stronger in the wnm than in dpm .",
    "this is even more clearly seen in fig .",
    "6 where we compare the theoretical predictions with the @xmath1 @xmath5 distribution from the 1996 data in a linear scale . in this comparison",
    "we observe some deviations at @xmath93 gev .",
    "this region should be studied with great care in the 1998 high statistics run . in our opinion",
    ", this is a most interesting region to look for eventual signs of new physics , i.e. for the onset of a truly anomalous suppression at @xmath94 gev . on the contrary , in the region @xmath95 gev ( where the break in the ratio @xmath17 occurs ) , there is no strong disagreement between theory and experiment .",
    "however , there is no perfect agreement either and , therefore , it is not possible to draw a clear conclusion at present . in particular a sudden drop of the @xmath1 cross - section at @xmath96 gev",
    "has been claimed @xcite .",
    "even if further data show that this drop is statistically significant , our analysis suggests that it can not be easily attributed to a sudden increase of @xmath1 suppression due to deconfinement .",
    "indeed , in the next four @xmath5 bins the measured @xmath1 cross - section is consistent with the predictions of a model which does not have deconfinement .",
    "the @xmath1 suppression is described by the ratio @xmath17 of @xmath1 and @xmath8 cross - sections in different @xmath5 bins .",
    "the advantage of taking this ratio is that systematic errors common to both systems do not appear in this ratio .",
    "the inconvenient , however , is that the results are sensitive to the shape of the @xmath8 @xmath5 distribution . in our opinion , it is of utmost importance to have good data on the @xmath5 distribution of the @xmath1  as illustrated by the analysis of the previous section .",
    "the ratio @xmath17 is given by [ 13e ] r(e_t ) = d^2b _ ab^(b )  p(e_t , b ) d^2b   _",

    "this ratio has been calculated , within the present model , in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the values of the parameters ( the same ones used here , including the absolute normalization but excepting the value of @xmath79 which , as discussed in the previous section , has practically no effect on @xmath17 ) were determined from the best fit to @xmath17 in @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath2 collisions . at that time , however , the 1996 data were not available .",
    "the comparison of the model results with both the 1995 and 1996 data @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "the model reproduces the qualitative behavior of the ratio @xmath97 . however , there are disagreements at a quantitative level .",
    "the overall suppression , both from the 1995 and the 1996 data , is somewhat larger than the theoretical one .",
    "more important , the 1996 data seem to show a break at @xmath98 gev which is not present in the model calculation . here ,",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "first , as seen in fig . 7 , the experimental data for the first @xmath5 bin is higher than the one obtained with nuclear absorption alone ( with a normalization extracted from a fit to @xmath10 and @xmath11 data @xcite ) .",
    "this is difficult to explain in any model .",
    "second , the relevance of the break at @xmath98 gev is weakened by the existence of fluctuations in @xmath17 at large @xmath5 of a comparable size .",
    "these fluctuations , which are generally regarded as spurious , are an example of systematic errors that do not cancel when taking the ratio of @xmath1 and @xmath8 cross - sections and have to be understood .",
    "third , the failure of the model to describe quantitatively the ratio @xmath17 in the region @xmath99 gev is in sharp contrast with the conclusions reached in section 3 from a direct comparison of the model results with the @xmath5 distribution of the @xmath1 which showed reasonable agreement in this @xmath5 region . in order to understand the origin of this contradiction we have plotted in fig .",
    "8 the theoretical curve of fig . 7 ( full curve ) , and compared it with the @xmath1 suppression obtained from the ratio @xmath100 of the experimental @xmath5 distribution of the @xmath1 ( for the 1996 na50 data ) over the theoretical one for the @xmath8 ( full curve of fig . 5 ) .",
    "we see that the agreement in shape between theory and experiment has considerably improved ; the remaining drop , strongly reduced compared with that of @xmath17 , can be attributed to a local minimum in the @xmath1 cross - section at @xmath101 gev ( difficult to explain in any model , see comments at the end of the previous section ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath100 is now rather well described in the region @xmath95 gev  except for the first @xmath5 bin . moreover , in the ratio @xmath100 the break at @xmath98 gev has practically disappeared .",
    "8 indicates that the ratio @xmath17 is very sensitive to the shape of the @xmath8 distribution .",
    "we would like to stress that fig .",
    "8 contains no new information .",
    "however , it is useful since its comparison with fig .",
    "7 shows the effect on the ratio @xmath17 of smoothing out the @xmath8 cross - section .    before concluding this section we would like to comment on the modifications in the ratio @xmath17 when using the comover density computed in the wnm , rather than the one based on dpm , eq .",
    "( [ 8e ] ) .",
    "as discussed in section 2 , the wnm underestimates the number of negative particles in a central @xmath2 collision at @xmath102 by @xmath103 % .",
    "the corresponding dpm value is 30 % larger than the wnm one and in better agreement with the na49 data ( see section 2 ) .",
    "if we would decrease the density of comovers by 30 % for the most central @xmath5 bin , the value of @xmath17 would decrease by about 10 % .",
    "actually , the net effect would be significantly smaller , since the wnm multiplicity is smaller than the dpm one also in @xmath11 , and this can be compensated by a corresponding increase of @xmath28 .",
    "although a difference would remain , it would not basically change the conclusions of the present analysis . on the contrary , our results",
    "would be changed if we were to use the wnm in the calorimeter rapidity region , in order to determine the @xmath62 correlation . in this case",
    "we would obtain an @xmath5 distribution for the @xmath1 which would be too large in the upper half of the @xmath5 interval .",
    "a mechanism producing an increase of the @xmath104 of any type of particle produced in @xmath10 or @xmath36 collisions with increasing nuclear sizes or centrality has been known for a long time @xcite .",
    "it is due to initial state rescattering .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath1 production this increase is due to rescattering of the projectile and target gluons , before fusion , with target and projectile nucleons respectively , encountered in their path through the nuclei .",
    "the average broadening of the intrinsic gluon distribution in each collision is denoted by @xmath105 . in ref . @xcite it has been shown that the @xmath106 broadening of the @xmath1 is affected by @xmath1 absorption .",
    "in particular the suppression in @xmath2 collisions in a deconfining approach @xcite , produces a maximum in the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath107 at @xmath108 gev followed by a decrease with increasing @xmath5 .",

    "however , after this maximum , @xmath140 is practically constant and only slightly smaller than the one obtained with nuclear absorption alone .",
    "this is in contrast with the sharper decrease at large @xmath5 found in a deconfining scenario @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of this decrease is the same in both approaches . at large @xmath5 ,",
    "corresponding to large comover or energy density , the @xmath1 , with large @xmath141 due to a large number of initial @xmath142 collisions , is suppressed by either the comover or the deconfining mechanisms . however , this effect turns out to be numerically much lower in the former approach .",
    "unfortunately , with the present data it is not possible to clearly discriminate between these two predictions .",
    "we have presented a direct comparison of the available na50 data for the @xmath5 distribution of the @xmath1 with the results obtained in a conventional framework based on nuclear absorption plus comover interaction .",
    "our analysis suggests that the presence of new physics in the region @xmath95 gev is unlikely . on the contrary ,",
    "the region @xmath143 gev is very interesting and should be studied with great care in the 1998 high statistics run .",
    "agreement of the @xmath1 cross - section with the comovers results for @xmath99 gev together with a significantly sharper decrease for @xmath143 gev ( for which there might be some hint in the 1996 data ) , would signal the onset of a truly anomalous @xmath1 suppression .",
    "is it possible with the present data to distinguish a deconfining phase transition scenario from the more conventional one described here ? in order to answer this question we have to distinguish between deconfining scenarios producing sharp breaks in the ratio @xmath17 @xcite from others leading to a smooth behavior of this ratio @xcite . for",
    "the former , a clear - cut answer will probably come from the 1998 data . on the contrary",
    ", it will be more difficult to distinguish the second type of deconfining models from the comover approach presented here .",
    "a very clear way to do so would be to show that the onset of the anomalous suppression is abrupt , i.e. it is not present below some critical density  for instance the maximal one reached in @xmath11 collisions @xcite .",
    "up to a recent date , there was some evidence for that @xcite .",
    "indeed , the effect of the comovers in @xmath11 produced a somewhat larger suppression @xcite than the measured one . at present , however , the experimental errors in the ratio @xmath17 in @xmath11 collisions have been increased by a factor 2.8 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ; also the experimental errors for @xmath2 have increased , by a factor 1.4 , which has been taken into account in this work ) . in view of that , it is no longer possible to claim that the @xmath1 suppression in @xmath11 is too large in the comover approach @xcite or that the onset of the anomalous suppression is an abrupt one .    as we have shown in section 5 ,",
    "there is a difference between comovers and deconfining scenarios regarding the behavior of @xmath144 versus @xmath5 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , in a deconfining scenario this quantity has a maximum at @xmath145 gev and decreases at larger @xmath5 values . in the comover approach presented here ,",
    "this drop is practically absent and the @xmath5 dependence is close to the one obtained with nuclear absorption alone . although no such drop is seen in the data , the present experimental errors are rather large and a clear conclusion is not possible .    a promising possibility is the measurement of the @xmath1 suppression at higher energies .",
    "the @xmath1 suppression due to either comover interactions or deconfinement , is expected to increase substantially with increasing energy . in the first case , this is due to the increase of the density of comovers with increasing energy . in the second case ,",
    "it is due to the corresponding increase of energy density  while the critical value of this quantity is unchanged .",
    "therefore , it is important to make predictions at higher energies in both approaches , using the values of the parameters determined from present data .",
    "one can hope that the differences in the predictions of the two approaches will be sufficiently large to be experimentally measurable .",
    "the main uncertainty in the determination of the absolute value of the suppression at high energies resides in the value of @xmath146 at @xmath102 .",
    "for instance , in central @xmath2 collisions , at rhic energies , one expects in dpm a value @xcite for negative particles @xmath147 , and 3500 at @xmath148 tev . on the contrary , from the scaling in the number of participants ( wnm ) one expects a value @xmath149 at @xmath150 gev and 800 at @xmath148 tev . in the first case , there is an increase by roughly a factor 5 at rhic ( 17.5 at lhc ) with respect to the value at @xmath151 gev . in the second case",
    ", there is only an increase by a factor 2 at rhic ( 4 at lhc ) , which is due to the corresponding increase of @xmath152 in @xmath25 collisions .",
    "an estimate at rhic ( lhc ) of the @xmath1 survival probability in central @xmath2 collisions is given in table 1 .",
    "the numbers in this table , for comover absorption alone , are obtained from eq .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) by rising the comover absorption , computed at @xmath153 gev for a central @xmath5 bin ( @xmath154 gev ) , to a power 2 ( 4 ) in the case of the wnm and to a power 5 ( 17.5 ) in the case of dpm .",
    "the corresponding numbers for the total @xmath1 suppression are obtained by multiplying the ones for comovers alone given in table 1 , by the nuclear absorption .",
    "the latter is expected to depend little on energy @xcite .",
    "these estimates illustrate the important increase of the @xmath1 suppression with energy and also the dramatic uncertainties associated to the value of @xmath155 .",
    "clearly , a more detailed calculation is needed which takes into account the modifications of parton densities inside nuclei ( usually neglected at sps energies ) and also the changes in the glauber formulae due to the increase with energy of @xmath156 .",
    "however , it is obvious that the @xmath1 suppression will increase strongly with increasing energies and it is very unlikely that the results will be the same in the comover and in the deconfining frameworks .      * acknowledgments : * it is a pleasure to thank a. b. kaidalov , a. krzywicki , c. a. salgado , yu . m. shabelski and j. tr@xmath157n thanh v@xmath157n for discussions , and f. bellaiche , b. chaurand , c. gerschel , m. gonin , c. loureno and a. romana for discussions and useful information on the experimental data .",
