    "many recent efforts have been devoted to global well - posedness for small initial data @xcite and blowup examples of some navier  stokes type equations @xcite .    driven by the various applications ,",
    "many numerical methods have been proposed for solving the navier ",
    "stokes equations , such as the finite element methods @xcite , finite difference methods @xcite , spectral methods @xcite , the lagrange  galerkin method @xcite , and the projection method for time discretization @xcite .",

    "stokes equations is inadequate . in most practical situations , the numerical solution looks smooth and does not change much if the mesh is refined .",
    "a natural question is , given a bounded numerical solution , what can we say about the smoothness of the true solution without assuming well - posedness of the navier ",
    "stokes equations ?",
    "we answer this question in this paper : for any given smooth initial data , if the numerical solution is bounded in a certain norm for a small mesh size , then the navier  stokes equations have a unique smooth solution and , simultaneously , the numerical solution successfully approximates the solution of the navier ",
    "stokes equations .",
    "it is remarkable that we only need one numerical solution to draw the conclusion , instead of a sequence of numerical solutions .",
    "to illustrate our idea , we consider the navier - stokes equations @xmath0 in a convex polyhedron @xmath1 with the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath2 on @xmath3 and the initial condition @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the viscosity constant ) , and we impose the condition @xmath6 for uniqueness .    for simplicity ,",
    "we focus on a simple linearized finite element method for the discretization of the navier  stokes equations .",
