    "studies on collective motion of coupled oscillators have attracted considerable attention over the last few decades@xcite .",
    "it is commonly seen that a population of autonomous elements performs certain biological functions by behaving collectively@xcite .",
    "it has in fact been pointed out that collective motion is crucial to information processing and transmission in living organisms@xcite .    in the brain ,",
    "the neurons are exclusively coupled through chemical synapses , i.e. , the neurons communicate by pulses of transmitter@xcite .",
    "chemical synapses commonly form dense and complex networks . for mathematical modeling of neuronal networks , homogeneous all - to - all ( or , global ) coupling",
    "is often adopted .",
    "although the global coupling may be a little too idealistic , the corresponding networks share a lot of properties in common with systems with complex and dense networks .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider a population of neural oscillators with delayed , all - to - all pulse - coupling .",
    "the oscillator we use is called the leaky integrate - and - fire ( lif ) model .",
    "there are a large amount of papers concerning lif in physics and neuroscience , e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "this is because lif is a quite simple model still capturing some essential characteristics of neuronal dynamics , i.e. , it represents an integrator with relaxation , and resets after it fires .",
    "though our population model is commonly used , ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , its collective dynamics does not seem to have been studied so carefully .",
    "we are particularly concerned with peculiar collective dynamics called slow switching@xcite .",
    "the study of collective dynamics in the original form of the model is not easy to handle because the coupling involves a long term memory .",
    "we thus develop an asymptotic theory and reduce our model into a form without memory , by which an analytical study of collective dynamics becomes possible .",
    "the population model we consider consists of @xmath0 identical elements with delayed , all - to - all pulse - coupling .",
    "the dynamics of each elements is described by a single variable @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) which corresponds to the membrane potential of a neuron .",
    "the equation for @xmath1 is given by @xmath3 the parameter @xmath4 is the so - called resting potential to which @xmath1 relaxes when the coupling is absent .",
    "it is assumed that when @xmath1 reaches a threshold value which is set to @xmath5 , it is instantaneously reset to zero .",
    "this event is interpreted as a spiking event .",
    "the dynamics is thus called lif .",
    "when a neuron spikes , it emits a pulse toward each neuron coupled to it , and the latter receives the pulse with some delay called a synaptic delay .",
    "the coupling is assumed to be homogeneous and all - to - all , so that its effect can be represented by one global variable @xmath6 , given by @xmath7 here , @xmath8 represents a series of times at which the @xmath9-th neuron spikes and @xmath10 denotes a summation over the series of such spikes ; @xmath11 is the synaptic delay , and @xmath12 is a _ pulse function _ , given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the heaviside function ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 are constants satisfying @xmath17 . in the limit @xmath18 , @xmath12 becomes @xmath19 , which is called the alpha function@xcite .",
    "@xmath20 is called the reversal potential to which @xmath1 relaxes when @xmath21 is positive , i.e. , while the neuron receives the pulses .",
    "@xmath22 is a positive constant characterizing the strength of the coupling .",
    "the coupling assumed above is characteristic to the synaptic coupling . the coupling become excitatory ( epsp ) if @xmath23 , and inhibitory ( ipsp ) if @xmath24 .    if @xmath25 , lif becomes an excitable neuron ,",
    "while if @xmath26 , it repeats periodic spikes , namely , it represents a neural oscillator .",
    "we assume @xmath26 throughout the present paper , and call each element an _",
    "oscillator_. then , we can define a variable @xmath27 varying smoothly with time , which turns out useful in the following discussion .",
    "we call @xmath27 the _ phase _ of the @xmath28-th oscillator , and define it by @xmath29 which varies between @xmath30 and the intrinsic period of oscillation @xmath31 given by @xmath32 note that @xmath27 satisfies @xmath33 in the absence of coupling .",
    "by numerically integrating our model under random initial distributions of @xmath1 , we find various types of collective behavior . among them , we are particularly interested in the slow switching phenomenon , which can arise when @xmath34 and @xmath35 . as displayed in fig .  [",
    "fig : slowswitching ] , the whole population , which was initially distributed almost uniformly , splits into two subpopulations , each of which converges almost to a point cluster .",
    "however , after some time the phase - advanced cluster starts to scatter .",
    "then , this scattered group starts to converge again as it comes behind the preexisting cluster . in this way",
    ", the preexisting cluster becomes a phase - advanced cluster . after some time , again , this phase - advanced cluster begins to scatter , and a similar process repeats again and again .",
    "in other words , the system switches back and forth between a pair of two - cluster states . for larger times , the system comes closer to each of well - defined two - cluster states and stays near the state longer . theoretically , these switchings repeats indefinitely , although in numerical integrations the system converges at one of the two - cluster states in a finite time and stops switching due to numerical round - off errors@xcite .",
    "the slow switching phenomenon occurs within a broad range of parameter values provided that @xmath22 is small , and the time constants @xmath36 and @xmath11 are small compared with @xmath31 . for larger @xmath36 and @xmath11 , the slow switching phenomenon becomes less probable , and the appearance of steady multi - cluster states becomes more probable instead . for @xmath37 , we find no two - cluster states involving slow switching , while steady multi - cluster states are observed in most cases .",

    "it should be noted that the reduced model is free from memory effects , but the effect of delay has been converted to a phase shift in the coupling function .",
    "similar form of the phase model is generally obtained in delayed coupled oscillators when the coupling is sufficiently weak@xcite .",

    "in this section , we study a two - oscillator system , or , @xmath77 . although the two - oscillator system is not directly related to the main subject of the present paper , one may learn some basic properties of our phase model from this simple case .",
    "defining @xmath78 , we obtain @xmath79 phase locking solutions are obtained by putting @xmath80 , and the associated eigenvalues are given by @xmath81 .",
    "figure [ fig : diagram ] shows a bifurcation diagram of the phase locking solutions , in which we take @xmath11 as a control parameter .",
    "we find that for small @xmath11 the trivial solutions @xmath82 ( in - phase locking ) and @xmath83 ( anti - phase locking ) are unstable , while there are a pair of stable branches of non - trivial solutions .",
    "the point @xmath84 is close to the bifurcation point where the in - phase state loses stability .",
    "the bifurcation occurs at @xmath85 , where @xmath86 corresponds to the minimum of @xmath60 ( see fig .  [",

    "because @xmath86 is negative , the in - phase state can not be stable for small or vanishing delays ( while it can be stable for delays comparable to @xmath31 due to the @xmath31-periodic nature of our phase model ) .",
    "@xmath87 is extremely small , which is due to the sudden drop of @xmath45 at @xmath46 and the particular rule employed in our model , i.e. , a neuron is assumed to spike and reset simultaneously .",
    "the width of the stable branches of the trivial solutions is the same as that of the decreasing part of @xmath60 . owing to the peculiar shape of @xmath45 ,",
    "the width is of the same order as the width of @xmath12 , which is @xmath88 .",
    "the stability of the in - phase state is identical with that of the state of perfect synchrony .    in terms of the original model",
    ", we now present a qualitative interpretation of why the in - phase locking state is unstable for small or vanishing delays . we consider the dynamics of two neurons which are initially very close in phase .",
    "the effect of a pulse on the phase @xmath27 is larger for smaller @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath89 is monotonously decreasing except when it is reset ( which reflects on the property of @xmath45 that it is increasing except @xmath46 ) .",
    "thus , the neuron with larger @xmath1 makes a larger jump in phase when it receives a pulse , by which the phase difference between the two neurons becomes larger when they receive a pulse . on the other hand , the situation becomes different if two neurons lie before and after the resetting point , i.e. , if the phase - advanced neuron has smaller @xmath1 . in that case , the phase difference becomes smaller when they receive a pulse . according to our dynamical rule , however , resetting and spiking",
    "occur simultaneously , so that they receive pulses when the phase - advanced neuron has larger @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the in - phase state becomes inevitably unstable even without delay .",
    "if we want to obtain a stable in - phase state for small delays , we should employ a rule such that a neuron spikes before it is reset , which would be more physiologically plausible than the rule employed here .",

    "we explain how a _ heteroclinic loop _ between the @xmath96 and @xmath111 is stably formed in our model .    similarly to the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : two - oscillator ] , the stability property mentioned above can also be understood in terms of the original model .",
    "every neuron inside the phase - advanced cluster always receives pulses when its membrane potential is increasing . then",
    ", the phase - difference between two neurons inside the cluster , if any , always increases , so that the phase - advanced cluster is inevitably unstable . on the other hand , the neurons inside the phase - retarded cluster can receive pulses ( emitted by the phase - advanced cluster ) during their resetting .",
    "then , the phase - differences between neurons inside the phase - retarded cluster , if any , become smaller , so that the phase - retarded cluster can be stable .",
    "we first note that there is a particular symmetry of our model which turns out crucial to the persistent formation of the heteroclinic loop .",
    "the symmetry is given by @xmath112 due to this symmetry , the units which have the same membrane potential at a given time behave identically thereafter . in other words , once a point cluster is formed , it remain a point cluster forever .",
    "we assume that a pair of two - cluster states ( called a and b ) exists and has the same stability property as that discussed in sec .",

    "a heteroclinic loop is thus formed between the pair of the two cluster states a and b.    in terms of the phase model , the above argument can be reinterpreted in a little more precise language . in the phase model given by eq .",
    "( [ pm ] ) , a symmetry property similar to eq .",
