    "many astrophysical observations support the existence of cold dark matter ( cdm ) in our universe , but its properties , such as its mass , spin , and interactions , are still largely unknown .",
    "several decades of experimental work have been spent trying to detect dark matter particles coming to earth ( direct detection ) , or more generally products of dark matter reactions in outer space ( indirect detection ) . in the both cases , very interesting signals , which might be originated by dark matters , were observed , but we could have not yet concluded that they are really the evidences of dark matters .    on the other hand , it is well known that the standard model ( sm ) describes the particle physics , up to the weak scale . except for the higgs sector",
    ", the sm has been investigated very well and we know that it can realize most of all the experimental results at high accuracy",
    ". however , one of the insufficient points of the sm might be dark matter physics .",
    "the sm does not include a heavy neutral stable particle which could be a cdm candidate , so that the extension of the sm may be required .    in this letter",
    ", we propose the extension to gauged @xmath0 symmetric models , motivated by cdm . in our models ,",
    "the additional gauged symmetry is assigned to the sm fermions and extra chiral fermions are also added to satisfy the anomaly conditions . some of the extra fermions become neutral and stable after the electro - weak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . furthermore , an extra scalar which is only charged under @xmath0 is required to avoid stable extra quarks .",
    "it also becomes stable because of the remnant global symmetry after @xmath0 symmetry breaking , and interacts with the sm fermions through the @xmath0 gauge boson exchanging .",
    "when we consider the extension of our models to the supersymmetric , we could realize another cdm candidates such as the superpartner of the additional scalar and neutralino .",
    "this letter is devoted as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce our @xmath0 models , where the sm particles are charged under @xmath0 symmetry and extra fermions are added for the anomaly conditions .",
    "we also see that some of the extra particles become neutral and good cdm candidates in the section 3 .",
    "the cdms interact with the sm particles through the new gauge boson exchanging , and could achieve the correct relic density and predict the signal of direct detections . as an illustrative model , we consider a supersymmetric gauged @xmath1 model  @xcite in the section 4 , and estimate the thermal relic density and the cross section of direct detection with proton .",
    "we start with @xmath0 gauge models with the following flavor - dependent charge assignments :    ccccccc & @xmath2 & @xmath3 & @xmath4 & @xmath0 + @xmath5 & @xmath6 & @xmath7 & @xmath8 & @xmath9 + @xmath10 & @xmath6 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & @xmath13 + @xmath14 & @xmath6 & @xmath11 & @xmath15 & @xmath16 + @xmath17 & @xmath11 & @xmath7 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 + @xmath20 & @xmath11 & @xmath11 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 + @xmath23 & @xmath11 & @xmath7 & @xmath24 & @xmath25 + @xmath26 & @xmath11 & @xmath11 & @xmath27 & @xmath28 +    with @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are generation indices .",
    "@xmath26 is a sm - gauge singlet with nonzero @xmath0 charge which is required to break @xmath0 spontaneously and generate nonzero masses for @xmath32 and extra fermions .",
    "the flavor - dependent @xmath0 models generally become anomalous without extra chiral fields .",
    "one of the simplest ways to construct anomaly - free theory is to add one extra generation and two sm gauge vector - like pairs as follows :    ccccccc & @xmath2 & @xmath3 & @xmath4 & @xmath0 + @xmath33 & @xmath6 & @xmath7 & @xmath8 & @xmath34 + @xmath35 & @xmath6 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & @xmath36 + @xmath37 & @xmath6 & @xmath11 & @xmath15 & @xmath38 + @xmath39 & @xmath11 & @xmath7 & @xmath18 & @xmath40 + @xmath41 & @xmath11 & @xmath11 & @xmath21 & @xmath42 + @xmath43 & @xmath11 & @xmath7 & @xmath18 & @xmath44 + @xmath45 & @xmath11 & @xmath7 & @xmath18 & @xmath46 + @xmath47 & @xmath11 & @xmath7 & @xmath18 & @xmath48 + @xmath49 & @xmath11 & @xmath7 & @xmath18 & @xmath50 +    @xmath33 , @xmath35 , @xmath37 , @xmath39 , and @xmath41 are like the extra sm fermions of the fourth generation and their chiralities are opposite .",
    "the @xmath0 charges are defined to satisfy the conditions for @xmath0 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we just assume that they also satisfy the condition for @xmath54 , but there might be not so many simple solutions , if one requires rational numbers for all the @xmath0 charges .",
    "@xmath55 contribute to only @xmath56 , and we can easily find the solution with @xmath57 , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one can replace the @xmath3 doublets @xmath58 @xmath59 with @xmath2 triplets , whose @xmath4 charges are @xmath12 and @xmath0 charges are the same .",
    "one can also replace them with fields charged or not charged under @xmath60 .",
    "as discused in the section 4 , we can also consider the case with @xmath61 and @xmath62 where the anomaly condition for @xmath56 is satisfied without the sm gauge vector - like pairs .",
    "we also have constraints on the @xmath0 charges from the yukawa couplings which generate masses of the sm fermions and extra fermions .",
    "furthermore , our charge assignment may allow the mixing between the sm fermions and the extra fermions , which causes the flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) .",
    "for example , in the case that @xmath25 , @xmath19 and @xmath22 are set to @xmath27 , we can generally write down the mixing terms between sm leptons and extra leptons , such as @xmath63 .",
    "we assume that such tree - level mixing terms are controlled to avoid the fcnc problem .",
    "as we discuss in the above , we require the extra fermions , depending on the charge assignment . in this section ,",
    "we comment on the possibility that the required chiral fields give rise to cdm candidates , based on ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first , let us focus on models with @xmath3 doublet pairs , @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 are chiral fields charged under @xmath66 like the left - handed lepton , so we can expect one component to be charged and the other to be neutral after ewsb .",
    "the yukawa couplings corresponding to the mass terms are given by the extra scalar , @xmath26 with @xmath0 charge , @xmath28 .",
    "when @xmath28 is set to @xmath11 , mass terms of@xmath58 ( or ( @xmath67 ) are linear to the @xmath68 , because the solution with @xmath57 is found in any cases .",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 do not have yukawa couplings with the sm fermions because of @xmath0 symmetry , so that @xmath69 global symmetry , which is phase rotation of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , could be assigned , and their stabilities are guaranteed by the global symmetry .",
    "after ewsb , one component is charged and the other is neutral .",
    "their masses are degenerate before ewsb , but especially the charged particles get enough large radiative corrections and then heavier than the neutral . if the mass split is bigger than the electron mass , the charged can decay to the neutral , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 through the weak interaction .",
    "we conclude that the light neutral components could be good cdm candidates .",
    "the cdm can annihilate to 2 light sm fermions through @xmath32 and @xmath72 boson exchanging , and 2 gauge boson in the @xmath73-channel , so that the thermal relic density could be achieved by the gauge interactions .",
    "the mass of the cdm is constrained by the search for extra leptons , that is , it should be heavier than @xmath74 gev , where the direct searches for dark matters shows negative results . even if we consider the scenario that @xmath32 interaction is negligible in the direct scattering , @xmath75 boson exchanging will work at the higher order .",
    "such heavy cdm scenario is not favored by the direct searches , such as xenon100  @xcite .",
    "next , we discuss the case with extra @xmath2 triplets , @xmath76 or only the extra family , such as @xmath77 , @xmath37 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the mass terms of @xmath76 are give by @xmath26 like the masses of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the masses of the extra family are given by the @xmath3 doublet higgs like the sm fermions .",
    "those extra colored particles would be stable because of the @xmath0 symmetry and the chirality . in order to allow the decay of the extra colored particles ,",
    "we introduce mixing term between the extra quarks and the sm quarks according to adding @xmath78 , where @xmath78 is a sm gauge - singlet scalar with @xmath0 charge .",
    "@xmath78 has the yukawa couplings , such as @xmath79 , and the extra quarks could decay to @xmath78 and the sm quarks if @xmath78 is lighter that the extra quarks .",
    "if @xmath78 does not get nonzero vev , we can avoid tree - level fcnc and expect @xmath78 to be stable because of the remnant global symmetry after @xmath0 breaking .",
    "this type of dark matter has been well investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we discuss the dark matter physics in the gauged @xmath80 model , in the next section .",
    "as an illustrative model , we discuss the supersymmetric gauged @xmath1 model , which has been proposed in ref .",
    "the gauged @xmath81 is anomalous in the @xmath82 and the @xmath83 products , so that the extra generation , which was introduced in sec .  2 ,",
    "is required .",
    "based on the argument in sec .  3",
    ", the extra scalar , @xmath78 , with nonzero @xmath81 charge should be added and @xmath78 will be a good cdm candidate @xcite . if we consider the extension to the supersymmetric , we can realize several cdm candidates , such as @xmath78 , the superpartner of @xmath78 , @xmath84 , and the neutralino , because of the remnant global @xmath69 symmetry , which is originated by the gauged @xmath81 , and the r - parity , which could be realized spontaneously after @xmath1 breaking @xcite .",
    "the cdms , @xmath78 and @xmath84 , could annihilate to the sm particles through the @xmath81 gauge boson ( @xmath85 ) exchanging , and the new gauge interaction could be strong , compared with the well - known gauge symmetry , such as @xmath86 .",
    "this is because such leptophobic charge assignment can evade the strong bound from the drell - yang process , assuming that the kinetic mixing is enough small . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the dark matter physics and introduce the constraints on the leptophobic gauge interaction .    in this model , @xmath78 and @xmath84",
    "can annihilate to the sm quarks though the @xmath85 exchanging .",
    "if the yukawa couplings with the extra quarks and the sm quarks are sizable , the cdms can also annihilate in the @xmath73-channel .",
    "however , the yukawa couplings should be controlled to avoid the fcncs , so that we simply assume that the yukawa couplings are enough small , compared with the gauge interaction .",
    "depending on the mass spectrum of @xmath78 and @xmath84 , we can describe the each scenario : @xmath78 or @xmath84 is a cdm .",
    "the thermal relic density is given by the annihilation cross section of the cdm to the sm particles , and it is well known that the cross section should be @xmath87pb to explain the wmap data .",
    "@xmath78 and @xmath84 annihilate to the sm quarks through the @xmath85 exchanging : the cross section , @xmath88 , could be estimated as @xmath89 in the scalar case and @xmath90 in the dirac case , if the each cdm mass is far from the resonance , @xmath91 . on the other hand ,",
    "the experiments of the direct detections succeed in limiting the scattering cross section of the cdm with nuclei .",
    "for example , if @xmath92 is @xmath93gev , the spin - independent cross section , @xmath94 , should be smaller than @xmath95@xmath96  @xcite .",
    "now @xmath94 is also linear to @xmath97 , so that @xmath98 will be less than @xmath11pb , which induce the overproduction of the cdm .",
    "if @xmath92 is lower than the energy threshold of the direct detections , the upper bound on @xmath99 would be relaxed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we discussed the scenario that @xmath100gev and @xmath101gev , motivated by the @xmath102 excess which was reported by the cdf collaboration  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the dotted pink line also corresponds to the @xmath103gev case with @xmath104 .",
    "the cresst experiment @xcite gives the strongest bound and the bound is just below the dotted pink line .",
    "furthermore , it has been pointed out that the mono - jet signals , @xmath105 , strongly constrain the heavy @xmath85 scenario @xcite .",
    "in fact , the bound seems to appear at the order , @xmath106@xmath96 in fig .  [ fig1 ] , which totally cover the dotted - pink line @xcite .    on the other",
    "had , we could consider the scenario with very small @xmath107 and small @xmath108 , because of the leptophobic charge assignment . in this case , the mono - jet bound could be relaxed because of the small gauge coupling . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the strongest bounds come from the invisible and hadronic decay widths of the @xmath109 meson @xcite .",
    "contour lines of @xmath110 in the @xmath92@xmath111 plane are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for light @xmath85 .",
    "the parameter @xmath112 changes along each line .",
    "below each line , one has @xmath113 .",
    "the thick red and purple contours correspond to @xmath11412 gev@xmath115 and 20 gev@xmath115 , respectively .",
    "each contour shows a dip at @xmath116 due to the annihilation through the @xmath85 resonance .    even in this case ,",
    "the contour lines are just above the upper bound from the cresst experiment , except for the resonance . on the other hand , around the resonance",
    ", we see that the contour lines sweep the dama / cogent region @xcite for @xmath85 masses in the range @xmath117 to @xmath118 gev@xmath115 , touching the dama / cogent region on the left at the lowest @xmath119 and on the right at highest @xmath119 .     for several values of the @xmath85 boson mass @xmath119  @xcite . on each contour , the cosmic density of particles @xmath78 ( fermions in panel ( a ) , and scalars in panel ( b ) ) equals the cosmic density of cdm .",

    "we discussed @xmath0 models , especially motivated by cdm .",
