    "the choice for a bpl model is based on the time - integrated spectroscopy results of  ( v12 ) , and time - resolved spectroscopy of sgr  j0501 + 4516 @xcite which indicated a more complex relation between @xmath0  and flux than a pl ( e.g. , see figure  [ epkexa ] ) .",
    "an f - test showed an improvement in the fit , with a @xmath3199.99% non - chance occurrence , for 19 out of the 49 bursts . a more relaxed f - test criterion of @xmath3195% results in 37 out of the 49 bursts being better represented by a bpl than a pl ( see e.g. , figure  [ epkexa ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the flux values at which the break occurs for these 37 bursts seem to cluster around a common value and does not depend on any of the burst parameters , e.g. , @xmath32 , average flux , etc . a gaussian fit to the distribution of these break flux - values results in @xmath33 erg  s@xmath3  @xmath4 ( figure  [ breakvsflux ] , upper - left panel ) .    for the remaining 12 bursts ,",
    "a single pl model was a better fit to the @xmath0  versus flux evolution .",
    "however , examining these bursts closely , we noticed that none of them had more than 5 data points above ( 7 out of 12 ) or below ( 5 out of 12 ) the break flux level of the majority of events . figure  [ breakvsflux ] displays these single pl trends of the 7 and 5 events in the lower - left and lower - right panels , respectively .",
    "it is unclear whether these events would have followed the same break trend described above , had they had more intense or faint data points , respectively .",
    "finally , we studied the correlation between @xmath0  and flux for all 49 bursts simultaneously , and we show this result as dark - grey points in the upper - right panel of figure  [ breakvsflux ] .",
    "here we binned the data in flux requiring 40 individual data points in each bin , with the last bin ( at the highest fluxes ) having a slightly lower number of points .",
    "each black dot in figure  [ breakvsflux ] represents the weighted averages ( in flux and @xmath0 ) of these 40 individual measurments , while the error bars correspond to their 1@xmath30 deviations . although not shown here , we also binned the data sorted by @xmath0 , and tried different number of data points per bin ( from 20 to 60 ) , and we obtained consistent results .",
    "a bpl fit to the binned data is preferred at the @xmath34 level over a single pl model .",

    "we used the same approach as for the compt model parameters to identify the trends of these different correlations , fitting them for each burst separately to a pl and a bpl model , and performing f - tests to evaluate the improvement in the fits .    for 26 of the 48 bursts , we find that the temperatures of the low@xmath7 bb versus high@xmath7 bb are best fit with a bpl ( @xmath3195% probability for an improvement from a pl fit to occur by chance ) with indices and breaks consistent with each other .",
    "the rest of the bursts follow similar but not statistically significant trends , due to low number of data points . figure  [ ktvskt ] , upper - left panel , shows the relation between low@xmath7 and high@xmath7 values for all 48 bursts simultaneously . here",
    "( and in all panels of figure  [ ktvskt ] ) , we binned the data at 50 points per bin ( black dots ) .",
    "we find that a bpl is a better fit to the data ( black - solid line ) compared to a single pl , at the @xmath34 confidence level . above the break ,",
    "the relation is much steeper than below the break with slopes of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding break is at ( @xmath52 )  kev .",
    "these results are different than the time - integrated spectroscopy of these bursts , which showed only a positive correlation between the low- and high@xmath7s , with a very weak hint for a possible break at low temperatures ( v12 ) ; in that work , the slope of the single pl fit was much steeper , i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "to rule out any systematic effect as the origin of the break , and in particular the fact that the temperature of the low@xmath7 bb falls below the _ fermi_/gbm energy coverage , we looked at @xcite , who studied the combined spectra of the bursts simultaneously seen with _",

    "this could be attributed to the fact that only very few bursts showed an average flux above the flux break - limit that we establish here ( i.e. , @xmath106  erg  s@xmath3  @xmath4 ) . on the other hand ,",

    "finally , the @xmath123 correlation that @xcite found is similar to the one we find here but only for their brightest events with luminosities @xmath124  erg  s@xmath3 , where the area of the low@xmath7 decreases with temperature , at a slower pace than the area of the high@xmath7 component . below this luminosity ,",
    "the relation for both the low- and high@xmath7 areas changes sharply .",
    "although we see a change in the area@xmath7 correlation with flux for ( figure  [ 2bbvsflux ] , lower panels ) , it is more gradual than the sharp turnover that @xcite reports for sgr @xmath108 .",
    "@xcite studied the time - resolved spectra of the five brightest _",
    "fermi_/gbm bursts emitted by sgr  j@xmath110 , fitting them with a compt model and a 2 bb model .",
    "the authors found a clear double correlation between @xmath0 and flux with a break at a flux value of @xmath43  erg  s@xmath3  @xmath4 .",

    "moreover , the slopes of the bpl of the @xmath0-flux relation for sgr  j@xmath110 are in agreement , within uncertainties , to the values we report here for  ( section  [ compmod ] ) . for the 2bb model",
    ", @xcite found ( similar to @xcite and our results ) that the high@xmath7 area decreases faster than the low@xmath7 area as a function of temperature .",
    "the authors did not find a correlation between @xmath85 or area and flux , although , the quality of the data was not constraining .    finally , we note that the large amount and superb quality of data that we have in hand helped reveal new trends between the fit parameters of the compt and , especially , the 2bb model , showing the spectral evolution during short bursts with unprecedented detail . for the compt model , we established for the first time a strong positive correlation between the index and flux , above the break flux - value of @xmath43  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath3 ; the exact value of the @xmath0-flux relation turnover .",
    "noteworthy new trends for the 2bb model are , ( 1 ) the increase in area with flux , accompanied with a decrease in temperature , for the high@xmath7 component , ( 2 ) the increase in low@xmath7 area with flux while @xmath85 remains constant , until they reach a common break point in flux where the area starts to saturate and @xmath85 starts increasing , and ( 3 ) the smooth change in the slopes of the bpl fit to the area@xmath7 relation , and disappearing at the lowest fluxes where a pl is sufficient to explain the area@xmath7 relation , with a slope of @xmath125 .",
    "we discuss the physical interpretation of these new results in the context of the magnetar model in the next section .      in the following subsections ,",
    "we interpret our results in the context of the magnetar model .",
    "we would like to note first that the similarity in the evolution of the 2bb and compt model parameters with flux for all  bursts indicates that they were all triggered , more or less , by the same mechanism .",
    "moreover , all the correlations that we find here do not seem to depend on the intrinsic parameters of a given burst , i.e. , independent of the average flux , @xmath126 , fluence , etc .",
    ", implying that the radiative region is developing , and subsequently cooling , in similar fashion during all bursts .",
    "there are several models that describe the triggering mechanism of magnetar short bursts , most famously , the model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* td95 hereafter , see also @xcite ) .",
    "td95 considered the possibility that departure from magnetostatic equilibrium in the internal magnetic field of a magnetar , due for instance to hall drift and ambipolar diffusion , will cause a build up of crustal stresses .",
    "these stresses , with the presence of the ultra - strong magnetic field , will result in the cracking of the crust , and the injection of an alfven wave into the magnetosphere .",
    "energetic particles are accelerated throughout the region of the alfven wave , creating a trapped fireball of photon - pair plasma in the magnetosphere .",
    "another model for triggering sgr bursts involves a magnetospheric reconnection caused by magnetic instability in the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "this model can lead to the formation of a plasma fireball trapped inside magnetospheric flux lines @xcite , and also to thermal emission from heating of the magnetar surface .",
    "we note that the crust cracking model can lead to significant magnetospheric reconnection , since the external magnetic field will feel any instability in the internal one .",
    "regardless of the triggering mechanism , the trapped fireball formed during sgr bursts is hot , @xmath127kev , with an extremely high density ( td95 ) .",
    "hence , the radiative mechanism of short sgr bursts is the cooling of a hot , optically thick plasma , confined by an ultra - strong magnetic field ( b@xmath31b@xmath128 ) . in this regime ,",
    "the dominant energy exchange process is compton scattering , and due to the high optical depth in the fireball , photons will most likely be thermalized .",
    "the diffusion time - scale across the fireball at a distance @xmath56 from the ns surface is much larger ( @xmath129  s , td95 ) than the typical sgr burst time - scale ( @xmath130  s ) due to the enormous optical depth through the pair plasma .",
    "hence , the fireball likely loses energy as its cool surface layer propagates inwards ( td95 ) .",
    "a gradient in the magnetic field is expected throughout the fireball due to its large coronal volume ( @xmath131 , @xmath132 depending on the twist of the external dipole field , and @xmath56 is the distance from the ns surface , @xcite ) , causing a gradient in the effective temperature of the fireball at different heights above the ns surface ( td95 ) . the true spectrum",
    "would then be a distorted multi - color bb .",
    "alternatively , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) attributed the 2bb model , which they used to fit the sgr  @xmath108 bursts , to the effect of the strong magnetic field ( @xmath133 ) on the scattering cross - sections of the two polarization states of the photons @xcite . in super - strong magnetic fields , e - mode photons ( photons with electric vector perpendicular to b )",
    "have a much reduced cross - section and can potentially diffuse out from deep inside the magnetosphere very close to the ns surface , equivalent to the high@xmath7 component .",
    "o - mode photons , on the other hand , have a much higher cross - section and diffuse out from further out in the magnetosphere at large radii , correpsonding to the low@xmath7 component ( td95 , @xcite )",
    ". however , @xcite , modeling hydrostatic atmospheres in super - strong magnetic fields , showed that the e- and o - mode photospheres are very close in both temperature ( @xmath134  kev ) and location , in sharp contrast to our findings ( and those of @xcite ) between the low- and high@xmath7 components .",
    "we note that the true picture is even more complicated due to the fact that the evolving fireball during a given burst will sample a large range of field strengths and orientations , thereby mixing the radiative transfer elements of compton opacity .",
    "one way of overcoming the complications mentioned above , is if the 2bb components represent two physically , and geographically distinct emitting regions , each with their own e - mode and o - mode photospheres . according to the distribution of areas and temperatures of our 2bb modeling",
    ", one would expect a hot one located close to the ns surface ( or a hot spot on the surface ) , and a cooler one located further out in the magnetosphere . the large spatial separation between the two emitting areas ( @xmath62 orders of magnitude in @xmath55 ) will most likely induce a profound difference in magnetic field morphology between these two zones .",
    "nonetheless , the strong positive correlations that we find between the areas and fluxes of these two regions indicate that they are very strongly connected , and emitting at similar rates .    how do these two emitting regions evolve during a burst ? for the high@xmath7 emitting region , the decrease in temperature ( although small ) and increase in area with flux ( figure  [ 2bbvsflux ] , upper - panels , which is also true within each burst ) is a clear indication of an adiabatically expanding emitting region , in line with the fireball model .",
    "the area of this emitting region ranges from a small hot spot on the ns surface ( @xmath130  km ) up to a radius of @xmath135  km .",
    "this radius is consistent with the size of the effective radiative zone of the footpoints of the plasma fireball according to td95 ( considered to be the e - mode photosphere ) , which is about @xmath136 . also , the temperature of this emitting region varies slightly , ranging on average from 10  kev to 15  kev ( figures  [ ktdist ] and [ 2bbvsflux ] ) , although fluxes vary by more than 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "this is also in line with the cooling fireball model , which predicts a slight spectral variation of the emergent spectrum from the emitting region ( td95 ) .",
    "the evolution of the low@xmath7 component with flux is not straightforward to interpret .",
    "the temperature of this emitting region appears constant at very low fluxes while the area increases at a similar rate as the high@xmath7 area ( i.e. , with the same slope of @xmath107 , figure  [ 2bbvsflux ] , upper - panels ) . at @xmath137",
    "erg  s@xmath3  @xmath4 , the area starts to saturate while the temperature starts increasing . since both bb components emit radiation at the same rate ( figure  [ ktvskt ] , lower - left panel ) , an increase in temperature for the low@xmath7 component with increasing flux , while its area starts saturating ,",
    "is inevitable in order to maintain the same energy density as the high@xmath7 component .    at the highest fluxes , the radius of the low@xmath7 emitting area seems to reach a maximum of @xmath138  km ( see section  [ 2bbmod ] , and upper - left panel of figure  [ 2bbvsflux ] ) .",
    "this radius is much bigger than the ns radius ( assuming surface emission ) , even if we include the effect of gravitational lensing , @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the apparent radius of the ns at infinity , @xmath56 and @xmath141 are its radius and mass @xcite . in fact , considering even the largest and most massive neutron stars allowed by theoretical equation of states @xcite , we have @xmath142  km ( figure  3 in @xcite ) , much lower than the saturation radius of the low@xmath7 emitting region . on the other hand , in the context of the fireball model , where the surface area @xmath143 is a closed magnetospheric magnetic field bundle that anchors the emitting plasma , the saturation at such a level is expected since , for obvious geometrical reasons , it is difficult for the emitting region to be significantly larger than the ns area .    in the crust - cracking model for triggering sgr bursts ( td95 ) , this saturation radius , @xmath138  km , of the high@xmath7 component has very important consequences .",
    "the frequency of the alfven wave responsible for the creation of the photon - pair plasma fireball is , @xmath144  hz is greater than the corresponding maximum energy density of the burst . @xmath145",
    "( considering @xmath146  g , see above ) , while @xmath147  erg  @xmath148 , with @xmath149  erg . ]",
    "( which is consistent with a characteristic seismic mode frequency for neutron star crusts ; @xcite ) .",
    "this harmonic excitation of the magnetosphere , like any other , has a minimum characteristic excitation radius , @xmath150 ( td95 ) .",
    "this excitation radius can not exceed the radius of the magnetic loop , @xmath151 , trapping the plasma fireball , @xmath152 , as this will result in an inefficient excitation ( td95 ) .",
    "the maximum effective area of the low@xmath7 component , @xmath153 , could be assumed to be a fraction , @xmath154 , of the expected projected area of the relevant magnetic field loop , @xmath155 , where @xmath156  cm is the length - scale of the surface crack ( td95 ) , and @xmath157 is the ns radius ( assumed to be 10  km ) .",
    "this implies that    @xmath158    assuming @xmath159  km .",
    "this @xmath154 scaling comes from the fact that the derived radius , @xmath11 , of the low@xmath7 effective area spans magnetic field lines anchored over a large angle of order unity on the stellar surface , whereas in the case of a magnetic loop with small area footpoints ( corresponding to the hot bb effective area ) , a smaller angle of order @xmath160 is expected .",
    "finally , according to the star - quake model , the minimum excitation radius of the alfven wave is ( td95 ) ,    @xmath161    where @xmath162  g is the core magnetic field strength , @xmath163 is the yield strain of the crust @xcite , and @xmath164  cm  s@xmath3 is the shear wave velocity @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , since @xmath165  km , this yields a crustal internal magnetic field ,    @xmath166    we note that we used the limits on @xmath167 and @xmath168 that yield the stringent lower limit on the crustal internal magnetic field @xmath169 . a more reasonable values for @xmath167 ( @xmath170  cm  s@xmath3 , @xcite ) , and @xmath168 ( @xmath171 , @xcite ) , and",
    "substituting @xmath151 with @xmath11 results in ,    @xmath172    we could also derive an upper - limit on the crustal internal magnetic field considering that the maximum observed energy , @xmath173  erg , where @xmath174 is the bin time - interval , does not exceed the maximum magnetic energy possibly released in an area @xmath175 on the crust , which is @xmath176  erg ( td95 ) . taking @xmath177 ,",
    "the above implies ,    @xmath178    another interesting finding in our analysis is the @xmath123 relation , and its dependence on flux , which is once again a complicated result to interpret qualitatively ( figure  [ 2bbvsflux ] , lower - panels ) .",
    "for instance , at the lowest fluxes ( @xmath179  erg  s@xmath3  @xmath4 ) we find that @xmath180 , i.e. , following lines of constant luminosities ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "the relation breaks from the above with increasing flux .",
    "this indicates that at the lowest fluxes , photons emitted by both components follow a perfect planckian distribution , and starts deviating from it with increasing flux .",
    "one possible way to achieve a purely thermal spectrum is if photon splitting @xcite is the dominant source of photon number changing ( td95 ) . at the lowest fluxes ,",
    "the size of the high@xmath7 component is extremely small ( some tens of meters ) , and very likely most of the emitted radiation is in the form of e - mode photons . at such small distance from the ns ,",
    "the magnetic field is super - critical , and due to the high temperature of the high@xmath7 component at these lowest fluxes , photon splitting is very efficient ( low@xmath182  kev@xmath183  kev , where @xmath184 is the bb temperature at which the photon splitting rate is sufficient to maintain lte , td95 ) , leading to complete thermalization of the high@xmath7 component",
    ". with increasing flux , the high@xmath7 temperature starts dropping and the spectrum starts deviating from a pure planckian , perhaps due to other radiative processes coming into play , e.g. , double compton scattering ( @xmath185 ) and bremsstrahlung .",
    "for the low@xmath7 component , the picture is not clear , mostly due to the variation in field morphology and opacity for both scattering and photon splitting at high altitudes .",
    "however , since these two components appear to be strongly coupled ( figure  [ ktvskt ] ) , we speculate that a deviation in the high@xmath7 photon distribution from a pure planckian model would lead to the deviation in the low@xmath7 component as well .",
    "the compt model that we use here in our time - resolved spectroscopy is meant to mimic classical problems of unsaturated comptonization ( see @xcite for more details ) . in this model",
    ", photons scatter repeatedly inside a corona of hot electrons , until they reach the plasma temperature , @xmath186 .",
    "further heating is impossible and a spectral turnover ( @xmath0 ) emerges .",
    "the power - law index below the turnover ( @xmath187 ) depends on the mean energy gain per collision and the probability of photon loss from the bubble @xcite .",
    "hence , the index @xmath187 depends only on the magnetic compton@xmath188 parameter ( @xmath189 ) , @xmath190 , with @xmath191 .",
    "here @xmath192 is the effective optical depth inside the scattering medium , modified by the strong magnetic field , and @xmath193 is the mean number of scatterings per photon .",
    "we note that in magnetars , such a corona of hot electrons could develop in the inner magnetosphere , caused by the twisting of the external magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "the magnetic reconnection model of @xcite for triggering sgr bursts fits this picture well , with any reconnection event being accompanied with magnetic field line twists .",
    "the correlation that we find between the index @xmath187 and flux is interesting in the context of the compt model ( figure  [ indexvsflux ] ) . at low fluxes , @xmath194  erg  s@xmath3  @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath187 is distributed around @xmath195 , i.e. , the flattest possible spectra .",
    "such spectra are achieved through repeated compton upscattering with @xmath196 .",
    "however , with increasing fluxes , @xmath187 starts increasing to reach @xmath107 at the highest fluxes .",
    "compton upscattering of soft photons has difficulty generating such spectra .",
    "these high values for @xmath189 suggest high opacity , and strong thermalization might be taking place inside the corona .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0-flux relation enforces this conclusion . the anti - correlation that we see between these two parameters below the break at @xmath2  erg  s@xmath3  @xmath4",
    "( figure  [ breakvsflux ] , which roughly corresponds to the break we see in the @xmath197flux and @xmath104flux relations for the low@xmath7 component ) could be explained if there were coronal radius expansion ( exactly the case of the high@xmath7 bb component , see above ) . on the other hand",
    ", the switch in this relation above the break and the hardening of the spectra with flux , indicates a saturation radius of the coronal volume , again corresponding to the saturation radius that we see for the low@xmath7 component . in the light of the above results",
