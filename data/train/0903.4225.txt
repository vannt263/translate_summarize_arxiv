    "the entanglement dynamics of open quantum systems has attracted considerable interests over recent years @xcite . by investigating a system of two qubits interacting independently with their corresponding vacuum reservoirs , ref .",
    "@xcite has pointed out the sudden termination of the entanglement initially owned by the two qubits at a finite interval , which is called entanglement sudden death ( esd ) .",
    "this intriguing phenomenon has recently been demonstrated experimentally by linear optics systems exp - lo1,exp - lo2 and by atomic ensembles @xcite .",
    "a great deal of theoretical investigations of esd have so far been reported yu1,lopez , ikram , asma , davidovich , ficek1,ficek2,bellomo1,bellomo2,zeno , bellomo3,paris , cao , wang .",
    "for example , based on the same model as in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that esd regarding the qubits would always occur under the thermal and squeezing reservoirs @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , studies of esd have been extended to multi - particle systems @xcite , which indicated the delay of esd time with more qubits involved .",
    "in addition , some studies have also showed that entanglement of qubits will revive in the case of a commonly shared reservoir @xcite or of independent non - markovian reservoirs @xcite .",
    "a question naturally arises : where has the lost entanglement gone when esd occurs ?",
    "an answer to the question has been given recently by @xcite .",
    "considering the systems and the reservoirs as a whole , ref .",
    "@xcite presented the lost entanglement to be transferred to reservoir degrees of freedom , which is called `` entanglement sudden birth '' ( esb ) of the reservoirs .",
    "intriguingly , esd of the systems and esb of the reservoirs are of some symmetry and esb might be occurring before , simultaneously with or even after esd , depending on different initial states .",
    "however , the discussions in @xcite are restricted to the weak coupling regime under the markovian approximation , which only works when the reservoir correlation time is small compared to the relaxation time of the system @xcite .",
    "if the qubit is strongly coupled to its environment or the characteristic time of the system is shorter than the environmental correlation time open - book , solid , such as in recent experiments with cavity qed system exp - qed or solid - state systems @xcite , the situation would be much complicated and we have to give up the markovian approximation in treatment .",
    "the present paper is focused on the study of entanglement dynamics without the markovian approximation for two qubits interacting , respectively , with two independent reservoirs . for the initial condition with the two qubits entangled",
    ", we will study esd and esb , and show their different variation from the markovian treatment .",
    "we consider a two - qubit system coupling to two uncorrelated vacuum reservoirs at zero temperature . since there is no interaction between the two pairs of qubit - reservoir ,",
    "the dynamics of the whole system can be obtained simply from the evolution of the individual pairs lopez , bellomo1 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the individual qubit - reservoir pair under the rotating wave approximation is given by ( @xmath0@xmath1where @xmath2 is the resonant transition frequency of the qubit between levels @xmath3 and @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 are the frequency , creation ( annihilation ) operator and the coupling constant for the _ _ k__th mode of the reservoir . for simplicity in our treatment , only one excitation of the reservoir will be considered .",
    "consequently , the initial state @xmath11 will evolve to    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the reservoir state with one excitation in the _",
    "_ k__th mode and other states in vacuum . assuming the initial conditions @xmath15 and @xmath16 we could obtain the following equation by solving the schrdinger equation of eq .",
    "( 2)@xmath17@xmath18 where the correlation function @xmath19 in the limit of @xmath20 is of the form @xmath21 with @xmath22 the spectral density of the reservoir . in what follows , we will consider in our calculation the lorentzian spectral distribution @xmath23 open - book@xmath17 in which @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 the qubit relaxation time and the reservoir correlation time , respectively open - book . in a non - markovian regime , @xmath28 i.e. , the reservoir correlation time is longer than the relaxation time of the qubit , and @xmath29 means a markovian regime @xcite@xmath30 as a result , in the non - markovian regime , the probability amplitude can be easily solved as@xmath31 ,   \\label{4}\\ ] ] with @xmath32 if we set @xmath33 , eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be rewritten as@xmath34 with @xmath35 /\\tilde{c}(t)$ ] ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we will employ concurrence @xcite to assess entanglement . in the case of the density matrix with the `` x '' type@xmath37 the concurrence",
    "could be easily calculated by @xcite@xmath38    we consider that the two qubits are initially entangled and the two reservoirs are in zero - temperature vacuum states , which is described as yu - esd,@xmath39using eq .",
    "( 5 ) , we could straightforwardly reach the reduced density matrices for the two qubits,@xmath40for the two reservoirs,@xmath41for the qubit-1 and reservoir-1,@xmath42and for the qubit-1 and reservoir-2,@xmath43 as eqs .",
    "( 9)-(12 ) are all of the `` x '' types , the concurrence of the partitions @xmath44 @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be calculated directly using eq .",
    "in addition , eq .",
    "( 7 ) also implies that the esd time of the qubits or the esb time of the reservoirs can be obtained from @xmath48 and @xmath49 however , as we could not solve them in an explicitly analytical way , numerical calculations are given below instead .",
    "1 shows the entanglement dynamics of @xmath50 , @xmath45 , @xmath51 and @xmath47 in the non - markovian regime with @xmath52 in fig .",
    "1(a ) , there are three regimes for entanglement variance regarding the two qubits : for @xmath53 no esd will occur ; for @xmath54 there will be entanglement revival after esd takes place ; as for @xmath55 entanglement will vanish forever at a finite interval @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the behavior regarding the two qubits , there are only two @xmath56dependent regimes for entanglement variance regarding the two reservoirs : esb or no esb , as shown in fig . 1 ( b ) . but no matter in which regime , the two reservoirs will finally be entangled in a time - dependently oscillating manner .",
    "the entanglement transfer is done step by step from the qubits to the reservoirs , which is reflected in figs .",
    "1(c ) and 1(d ) with the entanglement variance regarding the partitions @xmath46 ,",
    "@xmath47 etc . .",
    "the partitions @xmath46 , @xmath47 behave as something like relays , which get and release entanglement in an oscillating way .",
    "meanwhile the @xmath45 entanglement is enhanced also in the oscillating way .        to see more clearly and also to make comparison with the markovian treatment ,",
    "we have plotted fig . 2 for the entanglement dynamics with @xmath57 @xmath58 in the non - markovian regime , e.g. , @xmath59 when esd occurs at @xmath60 ,",
    "the entanglement of the qubits has been transferred to other partitions , e.g. , @xmath61 , @xmath62 @xmath47 etc . .",
    "in more details , we may first visualize that within an interval @xmath63 in which the entanglement transfer from qubit - qubit to qubit - reservoir is greater than that from qubit - reservoir to reservoir - reservoir degrees of freedom , and the entanglement of qubit - reservoir and reservoir - reservoir are both increasing .",
    "then from the critical point @xmath64 the qubit - reservoir entanglement begins to be decreasing until @xmath65 at which the entanglement of qubit - reservoir has been totally transferred to the reservoir degrees of freedom .",
    "however , in contrast to the case of markovian reservoirs with the entanglement fully transferred to the reservoirs at one time , due to the memory effect of the non - markovian reservoirs , entanglement will partially be recoiled to the qubit - reservoir degrees of freedom , or even back to the qubit - qubit degrees of freedom . as a result ,",
    "revival of entanglement takes place bellomo1,bellomo2 .",
    "this back and forth process will repeat until the entanglement of the qubits have been completely moved to their corresponding reservoirs .",
    "finally , the reservoirs are entangled .",
    "moreover , fig .",
    "2 also presents that , the stronger the qubits coupling to their reservoirs , the more evident the non - markovian memory effects .",
    "in summary , * *  * * we have investigated two - qubit entanglement affected by the decoherence from non - markovian reservoirs .",
    "in contrast to the smooth decay of the qubit entanglement in the case of markovian reservoirs , the entanglement of the qubits will revive after esd occurs in the non - markovian case .",
    "meanwhile , by means of the qubit - reservoir partitions as the relays , the reservoirs will be asymptotically entangled in an oscillating manner , which is a good interpretation of entanglement revival of qubits in the non - markovian reservoirs .",
    "we argue that our present study would be useful for quantum information science .",
    "for example , the solid - state qubits in systems with strong correlation always experience strong decoherence solid , exp - solid , exp - spin .",
    "so quantum information processing on any qubit in such systems should be affected by detrimental influence from the non - markovian reservoir . moreover ,",
    "fast logic gating is necessary in quantum information processing .",
    "as the characteristic time of the system during the fast gating is very short , we have to consider the non - markovian effect from environment in assessing the operational fidelity .",
    "we have noticed recent studies on non - markovian reservoir from the microscopic way zhang1,zhang2 .",
    "our present work from the phenomenological viewpoint , however , could explain some experimental observations of entanglement loss regarding qubits more straightforwardly .",
    "on the other hand , entanglement is the unique resource in quantum information science . as no system could be completely isolated from external noise",
    ", it is of interest to understand what happens in the entanglement transfer from the system to the environment , although whether the reservoirs are entangled or not is actually of no practical application with current technology .",
