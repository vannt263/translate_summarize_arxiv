    "the high power output from quasars is usually attributed to the combination of a supermassive black hole with a surrounding accretion disk .",
    "this belief is supported by a number of observations that indicate the presence of a deep gravitational potential well or a hot gas disk at the center of quasars or other active galactic nuclei ; e.g. , measurements of stellar velocity dispersion clearly showed a peculiar increase toward the center ( young et al .",
    "1978 ; sargent et al . 1978",
    "; see also ford et al .",
    "1994 ; harms et al . 1994 ) .",
    "malkan ( 1983 ) found that the optical to uv spectra are well fitted by the standard - type accretion disk model ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "recently , by far the best evidence of a supermassive black hole has been found by radio observations of nuclear h@xmath0o maser sources in ngc4258 ( miyoshi et al .",
    "alternatively , we can infer the presence of a relativistic object from the asymmetric fe line profile ( tanaka et al .",
    "these observational results are all attractive , but still the real vicinity of a putative black hole has not been resolved .",
    "q2237 + 0305 ( e.g. , huchra et al .",
    "1985 ) is the first object , in which the quasar microlensing events were detected ( corrigan et al .",
    "1987 ; houde & racine 1994 ; see also ostensen et al .",
    "these observations suggest that microlensing events take place roughly once per year .",
    "this rather high frequency is consistent with the microlens optical depth of @xmath1 obtained by the realistic simulation of the lensing galaxy ( i.e. , wambsganss & paczyski 1994 ) .",
    "we consider , here , specifically the microlensing events of this source caused by the so - called ` caustic crossings ' ( see yonehara et al .",
    "1997 for single - lens calculations ) .",
    "several authors have already analyzed this ` caustic ' case based on a simple model for quasar accretion disk ( e.g. , wambsganss & paczyski 1991 ; jaroszyski , wambsganss & paczyski 1992 ) .",
    "so far , however , only the standard - type disk , which is too cool to emit x - rays , has been considered , and thus the property of an x - ray microlensing of quasar , e.g. , q2237 + 0305 , has not been predicted .",
    "we stress here the significance of x - ray observations to elucidate the physics of the innermost parts of the disk , since x - rays specifically originate from a deep potential well .",
    "the observations allow us to assess the extension of hot regions on several au scales and resultantly to deduce the mass of a central massive black hole .    in this @xmath2 , we propose to investigate quasar central structure by using x - ray microlensing of q2237 + 0305 . in section 2 , we describe the method for resolving x - ray emission properties of the inner disk structure on a scale down to a few au . in section 3 , we calculate the disk spectra and light curves during microlensing .",
    "we here use realistic disk models : the optically - thick , standard disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) and the optically - thin , advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf , abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ; narayan & yi 1995 ; see also ichimaru 1977 ) .",
    "using microlensing , it is possible to discriminate the structure of quasar accretion disks , and possibly to map them in detail .",
    "broad band photometry will be able to detect the color changes , thereby revealing the structure of quasar accretion disks .",
    "fortunately , such observations do not require very high time resolution , if the lens is far from the observer . in the case of q2237 + 0305 , furthermore , all the four images are very close , @xmath3 , to the image center of the lensing galaxy ( e.g. , irwin et al .",
    "this situation and the almost symmetric image pattern permits us to neglect time delay between images ; e.g. , time delay between images a and b is @xmath4 for @xmath5 ( wambsganss & paczyski 1994 ) .",
    "we can thus easily discriminate intrinsic variability from microlensing ; if only one image exhibits peculiar brightening over several tens of days superposed on intrinsic variations which the other three also show , we can conclude that the event is due to microlensing . on the other hand , variations caused by superposition of other variable objects ( e.g. , supernovae and cataclysmic variables )",
    "are distinguishable in terms of their characteristic light curves shapes ( e.g. , sharp rise , reccurency , etc . ) .",
    "one important length scale for lensing is the _ einstein - ring radius _ on the source plane , @xmath6 , where @xmath7^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath8 is the typical mass of a lens star , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 represent the angular diameter distances from the lens to the source , from the observer to the source , and from the observer to the lens , respectively ( see paczyski 1986 ) . for q2237 + 0305",
    "( e.g. , irwin 1989 ) , the redshifts corresponding to the distances from the observer to the quasar , from the observer to the lens , and from the lens to the quasar are , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively . for these",
    "the einstein - ring angular extension and the radius on the source plane are @xmath15 and @xmath16 cm , respectively , where we assume an einstein - de sitter universe and hubble s constant to be @xmath17 , according to kundi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "we , however , emphasize that an even more important length is the _",
    "caustic crossing scale _ on the quasar image plane ( @xmath18 ) ; @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the time over which the caustic moves on the quasar disk plane and @xmath21 is the transverse velocity of the lens , including the transverse velocity of the peculiar motion of the foreground galaxy relative to the source and the observer .",
    "surprisingly , this is comparable to the schwarzschild radius , @xmath22 cm , for a @xmath23 black hole and is much smaller than @xmath24 . in other words , by daily monitoring , we can hope to resolve the disk structure with a resolution of @xmath25 2.7 au or @xmath26 , if a microlensing event takes place .",
    "we can then place a limit on the depth of the potential well at the center of a quasar from x - ray observations of the microlensing light curve .",
    "since an x - ray emitting plasma is within the potential well , we can conjecture @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 being the boltzmann constant , @xmath29 being electron temperature and @xmath30 being the proton mass ) ; this leads to a constraint for the central hole mass as @xmath31 if we observe every 6 days , we can achieve an effective spatial resolution of @xmath32 cm on the disk plane and thus set a lower mass limit of @xmath33 for @xmath34 in such a compact region .",
    "the maximally attainable resolution is , therefore , over two orders of magnitude better than what was obtained by @xmath35 maser observation .",
    "although x - ray observations alone are very informative , by simultaneous x - ray and optical observations allow us to obtain more detailed information concerning au - scale disk structure",
    ". we can set good constrain to the model parameters , such as @xmath21 from optical observations , because the standard - type disk , emitting the optical flux , is well studied .",
    "we demonstrate this bellow (  3.3 ) .",
    "let us next calculate expected x - ray variations based on specific disk models .",
    "the observed flux from a part of the disk at ( @xmath36 ) during a microlensing event is calculated by @xmath37}{4\\pi d_{\\rm os}^2(1+z_{\\rm os})^3 }   r_i dr_i \\varphi_j .\\ ] ] the integral @xmath38 over the disk plane gives the total observed flux .",
    "here , @xmath39 is the luminosity of a part of a disk , @xmath40 represents the amplification factor as a function of the angular separation ( @xmath41 ) between the source and a caustic , and @xmath42 is the redshift between the observer and the source . the amplification factor is calculated in the following way .",
    "we consider the idealized situation of a straight caustic with infinite length passing over the disk .",
    "this is a crude but reasonable approximation , since the size of the source ( i.e. , disk ) of interest is smaller than the einstein - ring radius on the source plane .",
    "then , the following analytical approximate formula can be used ( see schneider , ehlers , & falco , 1992 ) : @xmath43 where @xmath41 is the angular separation from a caustic in units of @xmath44 , and @xmath45 represents a constant amplification factor due to the initial amplification by the caustic ( i.e. , when the source lies outside the caustic ) and also due to the effects of other caustics . in the present study , we set @xmath46 so as to reproduce observed microlens amplitudes @xmath47 .",
    "the positive ( or negative ) angular separation , @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , means that the source is located inside ( outside ) the caustic ( see figure 1 ) .    to calculate @xmath39",
    ", we consider a hybrid disk model which is composed of an optically thick standard disk and an optically thin adaf .",
    "optical - uv flux come from optically thick parts while x - rays originate from optically thin adaf parts . for the optically thick part ,",
    "we assume blackbody radiation @xmath50 ( with @xmath51 being frequency ) , where temperature @xmath52 is given by @xmath53^{1/4 } { \\rm k},\\ ] ] if relativistic effects , irradiation heating , and compton scattering effects are ignored . here , @xmath54 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath55 is the black hole mass , and the inner edge of the disk ( @xmath56 ) is set to be @xmath57 .",
    "the fractional luminosity from a tiny portion of the disk at @xmath58 with surface element @xmath59 is then @xmath60 \\delta s$ ] .    in the optically thin ( adaf ) parts ,",
    "radiative cooling is inefficient due to the very low density . as a result",
    ", accreting matter falls into a central object without losing its internal energy via radiation .",
    "hence , the disk can be significantly hotter with @xmath61k , producing high energy ( x-@xmath62 ray ) photons .",
    "we use the spectrum calculated by manmoto , mineshige , & kusunose ( 1997 ) and derive luminosity , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is emissivity .",
    "included are synchrotron , bremsstrahlung , and inverse comptonization of soft photons created by the former two processes ( see narayan & yi 1995 for details ) .",
    "photon energy is thus spread over a large frequency range ; from radio ( due to synchrotron ) to hard x-@xmath62 rays ( via inverse compton ) . unlike the optically thick case , radiative cooling",
    "is no longer balanced with viscous heating ( and with gravitational energy release ) .",
    "consequently , emission from regions within a few tens to hundreds of @xmath65 from the center contributes to most of the entire spectrum ( see yonehara et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in the present study",
    ", we assign the viscosity parameter to be @xmath66 .",
    "the mass of the central black hole is @xmath67 and the mass - flow rates are @xmath68 g s@xmath69 .",
    "we focus our discussion on the relative changes of the radiation flux and variation timescales , and are not concerned with the absolute flux .",
    "it is easy to confirm that the parameters associated with the accretion disk only affect non - microlensed flux , and do not affect the timescale of microlensing events .",
    "although the only influential parameter is @xmath21 , it can be estimated by analysis of the optical light curves , since the theory of the optically thick disk is relatively well established . for simplicity , we assume that the accretion disk is face - on to the observer ( @xmath70 ) . if we change the inclination angle ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) , the timescale will be shortened by @xmath72 because of the apparently smaller size of the emitting regions , but the basic properties are not altered significantly .",
    "any how , a quasar is believed to be more or less close to a face - on view .",
    "the inclusion of the relativistic effects ( e.g. , doppler shifts by the disk rotation , beaming , or gravitational redshifts ) in the disk model could reveal the detailed disk structure in the real vicinity of a central black hole , which will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "first , we calculate the predicted spectra for the cases with the angular separation ( @xmath73 ) between the caustic and the source center normalized with @xmath44 at @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "the resultant spectral modifications by the lens are shown in figure 2 .",
    "for the optically - thick parts , not only disk brightening but also substantial spectral deformation are expected for @xmath79 .",
    "the spectral shapes critically depend on whether the emitting region is inside the caustic or not , since a large amplification is expected only when the emitting regions are inside ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : ampli ] ) .",
    "consequently , totally distinct spectra are expected for the cases with @xmath80 and @xmath81 , unlike the single - lens calculations ( yonehara et al .",
    "1997 ) . in the former case , higher - energy parts ( i.e. , _",
    "u_-band ) as well as lower - energy parts ( _ i_-band ) are effectively amplified , giving rise to a sharply modified spectrum . in the latter , in contrast , the higher - energy part is not substantially amplified , since the hotter parts are outside the caustic .",
    "this produces a relatively flat spectrum . as a result ,",
    "frequency - dependent , time asymmetric microlensing light curves are produced ( see  3.3 ) .    for the optically thin parts , on the other hand ,",
    "there are not large spectral modifications produced by microlensing ; the total flux is amplified more strongly over the entire energy range , although spectral modifications are bit smaller in the x - ray range .",
    "this is because in adafs the large emissivity is achieved only at several tens to hundreds of @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , timescales for x - ray variation are somewhat shorter .",
    "such unique spectral effects lead to interesting behaviors in the microlensing light curves .",
    "we continuously change the angular separation between the caustic and the center of the accretion disk ( @xmath73 ) according to @xmath82 and calculate the flux at each frequency , assuming optical - uv flux coming from the optically thick parts ( standard disk model ) and x - rays from the optically thin parts ( adaf ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the light curves of the microlensing events for the optically thick and thin parts .",
    "there are two interesting noticeable features .",
    "first , the light curves of the optically thick parts show strong frequency dependence in the sense that higher - energy radiation ( i.e. , _",
    "u_-band ) shows more rapid changes than lower - energy ( _ k_-band ) .",
    "second , the shapes of the light curves are different between the two models ; the changes are gradual in the optically thick parts , on a timescale of a few tens of days , while the variation timescales are somewhat shorter for the optically thin parts .",
    "this feature reflects the different emissivity distributions of the two disk models in the radial directions .",
    "that is , we can infer the radial disk structure ( i.e. , radial dependence of emission properties ) from the microlensing light curves at different bands . for this purpose , simultaneous monitoring by ground - based photometry",
    "is indispensable ; namely , we can obtain a good guess for the model parameters , such as the transverse velocity , by using the standard - disk model for optical emission .",
    "we can then determine the distance between the caustic and the disk center as a function of the observing time .",
    "on the basis of these data , we can clarify the radial dependence of x - ray emission properties .",
    "since the standard - disk model is fairly well established , and since it predicts that the effective temperature varies as @xmath83 , irrespective of the magnitude of viscosity , it is easy to tell the transverse velocity from the time changes of estimated effective temperature of the region brightened by a caustic .    in summary ,",
    "we have studied microlensing of a quasar disk by a caustic crossing using realistic models of an accretion disk . as a result",
    ", we have obtained the basic properties of microlens light curves of a quasar like q2237 + 0305 .",
    "future calculations , which incorporate the effects of caustic curvature and caustic networks , will tell more precisely how the amplitudes are determined .",
    "the authors would like to express their thanks to joachim wambsgan for valuable suggestions , and acknowledge matt malkan for helpful comments .",
