    "the mechanical contractions of the heart muscles are mediated by electrical waves of activation in cardiac tissue .",
    "disturbances in the normal propagation of these electrical waves can be arryhthmogenic because of the excitation of pathological re - entrant waves , such as spiral waves , in two dimensions ( 2d ) , and scroll waves , in three dimensions ( 3d ) .",
    "spiral waves are linked to cardiac arrhythmias , such as ventricular tachycardia ( vt ) and ventricular fibrillation ( vf ) .",
    "ventricular tachycardia is known to be associated with the existence of a single spiral ( or scroll ) wave in the medium  @xcite ; life - threatening vf is associated with multiple or broken spiral ( or scroll ) waves  @xcite .",
    "some studies indicate that episodes of vf are preceded by vt  @xcite , suggesting the possibility of an initial onset of a spiral wave , which then degenerates to a multiple - spiral - wave turbulent state ( vf )  @xcite .",
    "given that vf can prove to be fatal , it is important to understand this transition from vt to vf .",
    "many factors can affect the stability of a spiral wave ; hence multiple mechanisms have been proposed for this vt - vf transition  @xcite . here",
    ", we discuss the effects of inhomogeneities in the fibroblast density distribution on the stability of spiral and scroll waves of electrical activation in a state - of - the - art mathematical model for cardiac tissue , in which we also include fibroblasts .",
    "fibroblast proliferation ( fibrosis ) occurs in the heart during myocardial remodelling in , e.g. , ischemic hearts or hypertensive hearts  @xcite ; such proliferation is part of the wound - healing process after injuries caused , e.g. , by myocardial infarction . when fibroblasts are coupled to a cardiac myocyte , they can change the electrophysiological properties of the myocyte @xcite .",
    "this modulation of the electrophysiological properties of myocytes can , in turn , alter the dynamics of waves of electrical activation in cardiac tissue .",
    "also , because of the heterocellular coupling between fibroblasts and myocytes , the presence of fibroblasts modulates the conduction properties of cardiac tissue .",
    "therefore , the interposition of fibroblasts between myocytes in cardiac tissue can lead to the fragmentation of the electrical waves  @xcite and even waveblock @xcite .",
    "many studies have investigated the effects of fibroblasts on wave dynamics in cardiac tissue  @xcite . some of these studies model the fibroblasts as inexcitable obstacles @xcite ; others take into account the fibroblast - myocyte coupling and consider either ( a ) a random distribution of fibroblasts , with an average density that is uniform in space  @xcite , or ( b ) localized fibroblast inhomogeneities  @xcite .",
    "however , in real diseased hearts the distribution of fibroblasts may not be uniform , even on average , but , rather , there may be a gradient in fibroblast density ( gfd ) , as has been observed in aged - rabbit hearts  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in hearts that have been injured , say because of myocardial infarction , the fibroblast density may vary from a high value in the infarcted region to a lower value in the normal region of the heart  @xcite , with intermediate values in interfaces between these regions .",
    "it is important , therefore , to understand what role such gfd can play in inducing and then , perhaps , destabilizing re - entrant waves , like spiral or scroll waves .",
    "we show that a state - of - the - art mathematical model for cardiac tissue , based on the ohara - rudy model ( ord ) for a human ventricular cell  @xcite , provides us with a natural platform for ( a ) incorporating fibroblast - myocyte interactions and ( b ) imposing gfd in a controlled way so that we can study , _ exclusively _ , its effects on spiral- and scroll - wave dynamics , without other complicating factors that can be present in real cardiac tissue , such as scars , which lead to conduction inhomogeneities  @xcite .",
    "we carry out such a controlled study of the effects of gfd by using the ord model , for a human ventricular cell @xcite , with passive fibroblasts , as in the model of maccannell , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which interact with myocytes ( see materials and methods ) .",
    "we introduce fibroblasts in such a way that we can control gfd systematically .",
    "before we present the details of our study , we give a qualitative overview of our principal results .",
    "we find that gfd can destabilize spiral or scroll waves , i.e. , lead to the break up of a spiral or scroll wave into multiple waves .",
    "our _ in silico _ studies help us to uncover the principal mechanism of this gfd - induced spiral- or scroll - wave instability .",
    "the myocyte - fibroblast coupling changes the action potential duration ( apd ) of the attached myocytes .",
    "we show first how the spiral - wave frequency @xmath0 , in a homogeneous domain with randomly distributed fibroblasts , depends inversely on the apd of the myocytes in the medium , a result that is consistent with dimensional analysis .",
    "roughly speaking , gfd induces a gradient in the mean apd , i.e. , @xmath1 , in the medium ; therefore , if a spiral wave forms , with its core in a high-@xmath1 region , its rotation frequency near the core is low .",
    "such a low-@xmath0 region can not support wave trains that come from a high-@xmath0 region , say because of a spiral wave there .",
    "we find that the greater the variation of @xmath1 with gfd the more readily does spiral- or scroll - wave instability set in .",
    "we build on this qualitatively appealing argument by carrying out detailed numerical investigations of gfd - induced spiral- and scroll - wave break up , in two- and three - dimensional simulation domains , respectively , and in three models , the first with a uniform distribution of fibroblasts , and two others in which the mean density of fibroblasts changes either ( a ) linearly along one spatial direction or ( b ) as a step function .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the effects of other fibroblast parameters , like the resting membrane potential @xmath2 and the number @xmath3 of fibroblasts attached to myocytes , on the stability of such spiral and scroll waves . for a given gfd",
    ", we find that the larger the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the more readily does spiral- or scroll - wave instability set in .",
    "finally , we show how the presence of gfd can lead to the formation of re - entrant waves , like spiral waves , when we pace an edge of our simulation domain at a high frequency .",

    "we apply 20 pulses with this pcl , and we observe that a spiral wave is induced by such high - frequency pacing , as shown in figure  [ pcl250 ] ( see also the supplementary video s7 ) .",
    "thus , gfd not only provides a substrate for spiral- or scroll- wave instabilities in cardiac tissue , but it can also be a source of such re - entrant waves if the tissue is paced at sufficiently high frequency .",
    "such pacing - induced spiral waves occur with high - frequency pacing ( low pcl ) but not with low - frequency ( large pcl ) pacing . in the stability diagram of figure  [ phase ] , we show the region in which we observe such pacing - induced re - entry in the @xmath2-pcl plane in the presence of the gfd .",
    "the black - colored region indicates the region in which we obtain spiral waves , and the red - colored region is the region in which we do not see spiral waves .",

    "the wavebacks of the travelling waves repolarize ( come back to the resting state ) slowly in the low-@xmath0 regions , which are in the top part of our simulation domain in figure  [ pcl250 ] , because @xmath1 is large in these regions .",

    "by contrast , when we use high - frequency pacing , the wavefronts of the succeeding waves interact with the wavebacks of the preceding waves , and , because of the anisotropic repolarization that arises from the gfd , the succeeding wavefronts become corrugated , which leads to re - entry and the formation of spiral waves .     showing the pacing - induced occurrence of a spiral wave , in a 2d simulation domain with gfd (",
