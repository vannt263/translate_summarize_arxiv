    "<S> the @xmath0 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on a kagome lattice is studied using the density - matrix renormalization group method . to identify the ground state , </S>",
    "<S> we take four kinds of clusters into account ; periodic , cylindrical , and two open ones . </S>",
    "<S> the hexagonal singlet solid ( hss ) and triangular valence bond solid ( tvbs ) states are artificially generated by modulating edge shapes of the open clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the energy par sites of the hss state is @xmath1 , which is readily lower than that of the tvbs state ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees well with those of the cylindrical ( @xmath3 ) and periodic ( @xmath4 ) clusters , where no assumption as to the ordering is posed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that the hss picture is consistent to describe the ground state of the @xmath0 kagome heisenberg model . </S>",
    "<S> this is further confirmed by finding non - symmetry - breaking state in the calculations of the dimer - dimer correlation functions as well as the entanglement entropy of cylindrical clusters . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we estimate the single - triplet energy gap : the hss ground state has @xmath5 , while the tvbs excited state has a larger one @xmath6 .    for a long time </S>",
    "<S> , frustrated spin systems have been fascinating subjects of research for discovering new physics @xcite . among them </S>",
    "<S> a system attracting the most attention in recent years is kagome antiferromagnetic heisenberg ( kah ) model , and a lot of experimental and theoretical studies on the kagome system have been carried out , assisted by the improvement of research techniques .    in the @xmath7 kah system , </S>",
    "<S> one of the most striking finding is the fact that this ground state is characterized as a @xmath8 spin liquid @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental realization of spin liquid has been also demonstrated in the herbertsmithite zncu@xmath9(od)@xmath10c@xmath11 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , it is still debated whether the ground state is gapless @xcite or gapped with very small energy gap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another notable feature is the appearance of a series of plateaus in the magnetization process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest is a possible @xmath12 spin liquid plateau at 1/9 magnetization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the @xmath7 kah model exhibits a variety of phases , although it is a simple heisenberg system consisting only of the nearest - neighbor exchange couplings .    </S>",
    "<S> we here turn our attention on an @xmath0 version of the kah model . </S>",
    "<S> it would be a natural continuation of the study on the kah system . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a spin - one operator at site @xmath15 , and the summation is taken for nearest neighbours @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 is the antiferromagnetic exchange integral and we set @xmath18 hereafter . from the theoretical point of view , </S>",
    "<S> a very interesting point is an extension of valence - bond solid ( vbs ) picture @xcite to two - dimension . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the triangular vbs ( tvbs ) state was suggested as a ground state by the perturbation expansion around the complete tvbs limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after that , according to the analysis based on the exact diagonalization and variational method , it was claimed that hexagonal - singlet solid ( hss ) ground state is realized @xcite ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ states ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a resonating aklt loop ( ral ) state has been recently suggested as an alternative candidate  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of the @xmath0 kah model is still an open issue . </S>",
    "<S> so far , several materials have been synthesized as possible realizations of the @xmath0 kah system , e.g. , @xmath19-mpynn@xmath20bf@xmath21 @xcite , kv@xmath9ge@xmath22o@xmath23 @xcite , [ c@xmath10n@xmath22h@xmath24[nh@xmath21]@xmath22[ni@xmath9f@xmath10(so@xmath21)@xmath22 ] @xcite , and nav@xmath9(oh)@xmath10(so@xmath21)@xmath22 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> kagome antiferromagnetic heisenberg model : ( a ) the hexagonal - singlet solid ( hss ) and ( b ) the triangular vbs states . </S>",
    "<S> blue ( red ) line indicates a spin - singlet formation in six ( two ) @xmath7 variables . ]     </S>",
    "<S> sites . </S>",
    "<S> other pbc clusters are shown in the supplemental material . </S>",
    "<S> ( c),(d ) open clusters for obtaining the tvbs and hss states , respectively . ]    in this letter , the ground state of the @xmath0 kah model is determined . </S>",
    "<S> we use the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method , which enables us to study large - size clusters . for this aim , </S>",
    "<S> we exploit four kinds of clusters shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lattice ] . up to about 10000 </S>",
    "<S> density - matrix eigenstates are kept in the renormalization procedure and the discarded weight is below 10@xmath27 even for the most difficult case , namely , 36-site cluster under the periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , by calculating the dimer - dimer correlation functions and entanglement entropy with the cylindrical clusters , we find that the translational symmetry is not broken in the ground state.it is further confirmed with the pbc cluster . </S>",
    "<S> next , we _ intentionally _ produce the hss and tvbs states by modulating the edge condition of open clusters ( see below for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> it enables us to compare their energies directly . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest - state energy calculated with the hss cluster is @xmath28 and it is in good agreement with those of the cylindrical ( @xmath3 ) and pbc ( @xmath4 ) clusters . </S>",
    "<S> it is quite reasonable because the hss state is a non - symmetry - breaking one . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is striking that the energy estimated with the tvbs cluster ( @xmath2 ) is decidedly higher than the others . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we verify the hss state to be the ground state of the @xmath0 kah model . finally , we estimate the single - triplet gap . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state , i.e. , the hss state , has a gap @xmath5 ; while , the tvbs state as an excited eigenstate has a larger gap @xmath6 .        </S>",
    "<S> let us start with the cylindrical cluster [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lattice](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> we here use a type of cylinder denoted as xc6 - 3 , the notation of which was defined in previous works on the @xmath7 kah system  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for choosing it is related to the shape of both edges . in general , an open edge exerts a critical influence on the formation of plaquette or bond singlets . </S>",
    "<S> if the edge consists of either triangles or hexagons , the tvbs or hss state may be artificially favoured in our system ( [ ham ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a signature was also identified in the @xmath7 kah model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this problem should be avoided by choosing a xc@xmath29-(@xmath30 ) or yc@xmath29 type of cylinder , where both triangles and hexagons are _ equally _ arranged at the open edges ( see supplement ) . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the tvbs and hss states could be intentionally stabilized by modulating the shape of open edges in a ( small ) cluster </S>",
    "<S> . this _ technique _ is used in the latter part of this letter . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the same technique was used to detect the plaquette vbs state in the @xmath31-@xmath32 honeycomb heisenberg model  @xcite .    in order to check the configuration of singlet valence bonds , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the dimer - dimer correlation functions defined by @xmath33.\\ ] ] in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dimerdimer](a ) the values of the dimer - dimer correlation for each bond are shown with fixing one reference dimer bond . </S>",
    "<S> blue and red links denote positive and negative correlations . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that the patterns for the sign of correlations does not exhibit any spatial periodicity . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the correlation decays exponentially with distance of two bonds , as plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dimerdimer](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it clearly indicates the absence of symmetry - breaking order associated with dimer formations . </S>",
    "<S> a similar feature is also observed in the pbc clusters [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dimerdimer](d ) ] moreover , to make sure , we examine the von neumann entanglement entropy ( ee ) @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the reduced density matrix of the subsystem and @xmath36 is the full density matrix of the whole system  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we plot the value of @xmath37 as a function of the circumference of the cylinder @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the values should follow a relation @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a constant and @xmath41 is the topological entropy with dimension @xmath42  @xcite . by the fitting of our data with the equation , we obtain @xmath43 in the @xmath44 limit . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the system is in a topologically trivial phase , i.e. , a unique ground state , and it is consistent to the results of the dimer - dimer correlation functions .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we consider the tvbs state . as mentioned above , an ordered state like the symmetry - breaking tvbs state can be forcibly stabilized as the lowest state in a small cluster by taking a proper edge condition . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have to take notice the following two points to determine if the lowest state is really the ground state when this artificial technique is applied : ( i ) the ordering survives in the thermodynamic limit , ( ii ) the energy of the ordered state remains lowest among all eigenstates in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> if it is not the case , a level crossing with the true ground state occurs at some larger cluster . </S>",
    "<S> one possible realization of the tvbs cluster is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lattice](c ) . for this cluster </S>",
    "<S> we present the values of the nearest - neighbour spin - spin correlations @xmath45 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dimerdimer](e ) . </S>",
    "<S> a link with larger ( smaller ) value than that of the next bonds is coloured in red ( blue ) . </S>",
    "<S> a tvbs configuration is obviously seen . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , with increasing the system size , the spin gap is smoothly scaled to a finite value @xmath6 at @xmath46 ( see the inset of fig .  [ dimerdimer](f ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spin gap is evaluated as the energy difference between the lowest singlet and the first excited triplet states . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the tvbs state is confirmed to survive in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> we also make certain that this state is indeed of the tvbs with triangular three - dimer formations . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose , we modulate the exchange couplings as @xmath47 and @xmath48 for red and blue bonds in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dimerdimer](e ) , respectively ( @xmath49 ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ dimerdimer](f ) shows the spin gap as a function of @xmath50 . in the isolated triangle limit ( @xmath51 ) , the lowest state is exactly described by a direct product of triangular haldane - gap dimers with three @xmath0 spins ; as @xmath50 decreases , </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations between the triangles are increased and the original hamiltonian is recovered at @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting the spin gap is scaled perfectly by that assuming an isolated triangle , @xmath53 , for a wide range of @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the triangular haldane - gap dimers are quite robust against the inter - triangle fluctuations and the product state may be a good approximation of the tvbs state even at smaller @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> we can further see that no gap closing point exists from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , suggesting that the product state is intermittently connected to the tvbs state in the original model ( [ ham ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can confirm that the tvbs state indeed exists as an eigenstate of the @xmath0 kah model .     </S>",
    "<S> for the cylindrical cluster and of @xmath55 for the tvbs , hss , and pbc clusters . </S>",
    "<S> for the cylindrical cluster the @xmath56 limits are already taken . ]    for identifying the true ground state , it would be a natural step to compare the lowest - state energies calculated with different clusters . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gsenergy ] the finite - size scaling analysis of the energy per site for each cluster is presented . for the tvbs and pbc clusters , </S>",
    "<S> the energy is plotted with @xmath55 as usually assumed for two - dimensional systems . for the cylindrical cluster , </S>",
    "<S> we first take the @xmath57 limit followed by the @xmath58 limit . only the scaling with @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gsenergy ] . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the energy for the tvbs cluster in two different ways ; one is simply the total energy divided by the total number of sites ( @xmath60 ) and the other is an average of the neighbouring spin - spin correlations ( @xmath61 , where the factor 2 comes from the ratio of the number of sites and bonds in the thermodynamic limit ) . </S>",
    "<S> since one of them is extrapolated from the higher energy side with decreasing @xmath59 and the other from the lower side , as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gsenergy ] , this should make the scaling analysis more reliable . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolated values from the both ways agree very well in the thermodynamic limit and it is estimated as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the energies for the cylindrical and pbc clusters seem to converge rather faster with the system sizes , and they are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the energy of the tvbs state is high in number ( @xmath62 ) compared to those for the other two clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we thus argue that the tvbs state exists as an eigenstate but it is not the ground state .    in a similar way as the tvbs state </S>",
    "<S> , we can also stabilize the hss state in a small cluster . </S>",
    "<S> one possible realization is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lattice](d ) , where the hexagons are placed at the corners of open cluster . </S>",
    "<S> note that the outer @xmath0 spins are replaced by @xmath7 spins not to hold extra free spins when all hexagons form singlet plaquettes . by doing this </S>",
    "<S> we can easily detect the first excited triplet state by one spin - flip from the lowest state . </S>",
    "<S> for the hss cluster we estimate the energy as an averaged value of the neighbouring spin - spin correlations between the @xmath0 spins , namely , the outer bonds are excluded . </S>",
    "<S> the size - scaling is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gsenergy ] . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolated value to the thermodynamic limit is @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> it agrees to those of the cylindrical and pbc clusters within the error bars . </S>",
    "<S> since the hss state is a non - symmetry - breaking one , it is utterly reasonable .    </S>",
    "<S> although it is not possible to study a ral state with our method , our estimation of the energy of the hss state is readily lower than the variational energy of the pure ral state @xmath64 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the hss state is the ground state of the @xmath0 kah model . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that the tvbs state is the ground state when a certain amount of the second- and third - neighbour antiferromagnetic exchange interactions are taken into account  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely to happen because a frustration induced by the second - neighbour interactions naively lifts up the energy of the hss state .     for the cylindrical cluster , of @xmath65 for the tvbs , hss , and of @xmath55 for the pbc clusters . for the cylindrical cluster </S>",
    "<S> the limit for @xmath56 are already taken . ]    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we study the spin gap . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gap ] the finite - size - scaling analyses of the spin gap for the used four kinds of clusters are performed . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolated values to the thermodynamic limit are @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 for the cylindrical , pbc , and hss clusters , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> as expected from the above discussion , the three numbers are very close to each other . </S>",
    "<S> we thus determine the spin gap of the hss state , which is the ground state , is @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> it is considerably smaller than that of the tvbs state , i.e. , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this may imply that the triangular haldane - gap dimers in the tvbs state is more robust than the hexagonal singlet in the hss state . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in the tvbs state the spins are strongly screened and the energy gain from the quantum fluctuations between the triangles might be small . here </S>",
    "<S> we shall comment on the spin gap observed in a related material @xmath19-mpynn@xmath20bf@xmath21 . from the fitting of measured susceptibility with @xmath70 at low temperature @xmath71 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 was obtained as @xmath73k  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this system can be mapped to the @xmath0 kah model with @xmath74 k. by our analysis the spin gap is estimated as @xmath75k . this value seems to be reasonably close to the experimental one .    in summary , we have studied the @xmath0 kah model using the dmrg technique . </S>",
    "<S> four kinds of clusters have been used to determine the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we have succeeded in extracting the ordered hss and tvbs states by taking unique open clusters . </S>",
    "<S> it enabled us to extrapolate their low - lying energies individually to the thermodynamic limit . as a result , we have found that the ground state of the @xmath0 kah model is the hss state and the tvbs state is an excited one </S>",
    "<S> . however , their lowest - lying - state energies are very close , and the near degeneracy seems to make it more difficult to detect the true ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the dimer - dimer correlation functions and the entanglement entropy for the cylindrical and pbc clusters , where no assumptions for ordering are posed , suggest a non - symmetry - breaking ground state . </S>",
    "<S> it also supports the hss ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the singlet - triplet gap of the tvbs state is larger than that of the hss state . </S>",
    "<S> it means that the triangular singlet dimers are more robust than the hexagonal singlet , and the spin are strongly screened . </S>",
    "<S> it may prevent lowering of the energy derived by quantum fluctuations between triangular singlet dimers .    </S>",
    "<S> we acknowledge max - planck - institut fr festkrperforschung where a part of the numerical calculations has been done .    </S>",
    "<S> _ note added _  in preparing this manuscript we noticed two preprints on the dmrg study of the @xmath0 kah model  @xcite . although they argued different ground state from our conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , the ground - state energy in their calculations agrees with ours very well .    </S>",
