    "the stability of differentially rotating gas disks depends sensitively upon whether or not a magnetic field is present .",
    "a weak ( subthermal ) magnetic field undermines the stabilizing influence of coriolis forces ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) , and the resulting turbulence greatly enhances internal angular momentum transport ( hawley , gammie , & balbus 1995 ; balbus & hawley 1998 ) . this important behavior , which we refer to here as the standard magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , probably is the underlying cause of `` anomalous viscosity '' in accretion disks .",
    "while other modes of transport ( e.g.  waves ) are certainly possible , the classical enhanced _",
    "turbulent _ transport associated with @xmath0 disks is almost surely mhd turbulence ( balbus & papaloizou 1999 ) .",
    "protostellar disks remain problematic .",
    "they seem too dense and too cool to be magnetically well - coupled over their full radial extent .",
    "understanding how protostellar and protoplanetary disks behave is an ongoing theoretical challenge .",
    "it has also been recently noted ( gammie & menou 1998 , menou 2000 ) that the outer regions of dwarf novae disks may have a very low ionization fractions . that protostellar disks and dwarf novae both show episodic eruptions may be no coincidence ; in both systems the question of magnetic coupling ( and therefore the presence of mhd turbulence ) is a delicate one .",
    "this paper addresses a very small but fundamental part of this problem : the linear effects of hall electromotive forces ( hemfs ) on disk dynamics . while the results are more broadly applicable , protostellar disks will be the focus of this paper .",
    "the importance of the hall effect in modifying the mri was pointed out in a recent paper by wardle ( 1999 ; hereafter w99 ) , who analyzed the linear stability of a protostellar disk in the presence of a vertical magnetic field .",
    "such disks are generally in the hall regime .",
    "that is , their combination of densities , temperatures and ionization fractions places them in a realm of parameter space in which departures from ideal mhd are important , which are strongly influenced by hemfs .",
    "the hall effect tends to be important simultaneously with finite conductivity .",
    "numerical simulations of low ionization disks ( e.g. , fleming , stone , & hawley 2000 ) have not yet included hall terms , but have focused rather exclusively on finite conductivity .",
    "w99 found that standard , locally unstable mri modes may either be stabilized or destabilized depending upon whether @xmath1 is positive or negative .",
    "( here , as usual , @xmath2 is the local angular velocity vector of the disk , and @xmath3 is the magnetic field . ) in other words , hemfs appear to introduce a helicity effect into the problem .",
    "this immediately raises an interesting question : what happens if @xmath4 ? would the hall effect disappear ?",
    "since the w99 analysis was restricted to axial fields and axial wavenumbers , it could not address this problem .",
    "clearly hemfs do not simply vanish when the magnetic field lies in the disk plane , and the identification of @xmath5 as the fundamental hall stability parameter therefore seems suspicious .",
    "identifying this key parameter more precisely is important , for it is at the heart of mhd stability in low ionization disks .",
    "we are motivated , therefore , to examine the stability of hall regime accretion under very general circumstances .",
    "we restrict neither the local field geometry , nor the local wavenumber direction .",
    "furthermore , we have chosen to couch the analysis in a dynamical context , instead of ascribing the inductive hall terms to effective conductivities ( w99 ) .",
    "the effective conductivity approach offers terseness and mathematical economy ; the dynamical approach makes the physics of the coupling between the magnetic field and the disk coupling more transparent .",
    "both methods must of course ultimately be equivalent .",
    "it is enlightening , however , to view this important problem from a different physical perspective , and we have accordingly chosen this route .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in  2 , we discuss the basic formulation of the problem .",
    "this includes the various physical and compositional parameters , the fundamental equations , and an order of magnitude estimate for the relative sizes of the ohmic , hall , and ambipolar diffusion terms in the induction equation .",
    "section 3 presents the linear dispersion relation for a uniformly rotating disk , because this is the simplest setting to see the interplay between rotation and the hall emfs .",
    "section 4 is a detailed and extensive analysis of differentially rotating disks for arbitrary field geometries and perturbation wavenumbers .",
    "section 5 summarizes the findings of this paper .",
    "a typical protostellar disk consists of molecular gas with cosmic abundances , and spans a temperature range from 10 k in its outer regions to a few @xmath6 k near the central star",
    ". the characteristic disk size may be up to of order 100 au , and its total mass will typically be less than roughly 0.1 of the central star s mass .",
    "if 0.01 @xmath7 is spread over a cylinder of radius 1 au and height 0.1 au , this would yield an average mass density @xmath8 g @xmath9 , and an integrated column density of @xmath10 g @xmath11 , fiducial numbers one should bear in mind .",
    "the dynamics of the disk is likely to be dominated by the keplerian orbital velocity @xmath12 : v_k^2 = gmrr^2 ^2 where @xmath13 is the central mass , @xmath14 the cylindrical radius , and @xmath15 the angular velocity .",
    "the disk is assumed to be thin ; the characteristic temperature @xmath16 is much less than any virial temperature .",
    "the scale height @xmath17 ( defined below ) satisfies @xmath18 .",
    "the number density of species @xmath19 is denoted @xmath20 .",
    "the h@xmath21 and he number densities are assumed to be related by n_he = 0.2 n_h_2 , which implies a total neutral number density n = n_h_2 + n_he = 1.2 n_h_2 , and a neutral mass density = 2.8 n_h_2 m_p , where @xmath22 is the proton mass .",
    "this gives a mean mass per particle of = /n = 2.33 m_p , and isothermal and adiabatic sound speeds respectively of c_s^2 = 0.429 k t / m_p , a^2 = 0.6 kt / m_p , where @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "for simplicity we will define the disk scale height @xmath17 by @xmath24 . under conditions of interest",
    ", the dominant ion will generally be once - ionized potassium k@xmath25 , and accordingly we take a mean ion mass of m_i = 39m_p in molecular cloud studies , @xmath26 is more typically used ( e.g. , draine , roberge , & dalgarno 1983 ) .",
    "the coupling between ions and neutrals depends upon the rate coefficient , denoted @xmath27 .",
    "in essence , this is the the product of a cross section with the component of the relative velocity along the drift axis , averaged over the electron maxwellian distribution ( spizter 1978 ) .",
    "similarly , there is an electron - neutral coupling rate , @xmath28 .",
    "we follow draine et al .",
    "( 1983 ) and blaes & balbus ( 1994 ) , adopting the values v_in = 1.9 10 ^ -9 cm^3 s^-1 v_en = 10 ^ -15 ( 128kt9m_e ) ^1/2= 8.2810 ^ -10 t^1/2 cm^3 s^-1 the force per unit volume on the neutral fluid due to ion drag is given by an expression of the form ( shu 1992 ) = - _ i ( - ) , where @xmath29 is the ion mass density , @xmath30 the neutral velocity , @xmath31 the ion velocity , and @xmath32 is the so - called drag coefficient , = v_inm_i + = 2.75 10 ^ 13 cm^3 s^-1 g^-1 .",
    "our numerical value differs somewhat from draine et al .",
    "( 1983 ) because we use the potassium value for the ion mass @xmath33 .    electron - neutral coupling results in a finite electrical conductivity for the disk gas ( krall & trivelpiece 1973 ) : _ e = n_e e^2m_e _ en = n_e e^2m_e n v_en , where @xmath34 is the magnitude of the electron charge , @xmath35 is the electron number density , and @xmath36 is the electron - neutral collision frequency .",
    "the associated resistivity is = c^24 _ e = 234 ( nn_e ) t^1/2 cm^2 s^-1 , where @xmath37 is the speed of light .",
    "the dimensionless measure of the relative importance of resistivity is the magnetic reynolds number , re_m = v_a h , where @xmath38 is the magnitude of the alfvn velocity = , and @xmath3 is the magnetic field vector .",
    "finally , the cyclotron frequencies of the electrons , ions , and neutrals are denoted _ c = ebm_c where @xmath0 is respectively @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "although the neutrals are of course not directly affected by the magnetic field , the neutral cyclotron frequency is an important characteristic frequency of the analysis .",
    "the fundamental dynamical equations are mass conservation , @xmath43 the dynamical equation of motion , [ mom ] + ( ) = - ( p + b^28 ) - + ( 4 ) and the induction equation , = ( - ) . here",
    ", @xmath30 is the velocity of the neutrals , and @xmath44 is the electron velocity , and @xmath45 is the central gravitational potential .    in equation ( [ mom ] ) , which is dominated by the neutral component , we have made implicit use of the low inertia limit for the ions .",
    "ion momentum balance is set by balancing the ion - neutral drag force with the lorentz force , [ i_mom ] 1c = , since all other terms in the ion momentum equation are small .",
    "it is actually @xmath46 that appears on the right hand side of equation ( [ mom ] ) ; the low ion inertia approximation consists of instantaneously balancing this force against the lorentz force .",
    "note the appearance of the electron velocity @xmath44 in the induction equation . in ideal mhd ,",
    "the distinction between the fluid velocity and the electron velocity is unimportant .",
    "but in fact , in the absence of resistance , it is the electron fluid in which the magnetic field is `` frozen , '' since the electrons are the mobile charge carriers .",
    "the difference between ion and neutral velocities is responsible for ambipolar diffusion , and the difference between ion and electron velocities gives rise to the hall effect ( e.g. , wardle & knigl 1993 ) .",
    "in general , [ ve ] = + ( - ) + ( - ) = - n_e e+ _ i c , we are assuming that any ions present are singly ionized ( which is appropriate for a very low ionization gas ) , so that the electron and ion number densities are equal .",
    "in the ideal mhd limit , both @xmath47 and @xmath48 are assumed to be negligibly small .",
    "retaining them in the full induction equation leads to    [ ind ] t = ( - 4 c - n_e e + c _ i ) , where we have used the standard mhd approximation = c4 .",
    "the four terms on the right side of the induction equation can be arranged by order of magnitude .",
    "reading from left to right , we denote them @xmath49 ( inductive ) , @xmath50 ( ohmic ) , @xmath51 ( hall ) , and @xmath52 ( ambipolar ) .",
    "assume that typical fluid velocities are of order @xmath38 , and that typical gradients are of order an inverse scale - height @xmath53 .",
    "then , the relative sizes of these terms are ~1re_m , ~_ce _ en , ~_ci the first ratio just reflects the familiar fact that when the magnetic reynolds number approaches unity , ohmic losses are important . the results of  2.1 give ~1re_m = 4.210 ^ -14 ( nn_e ) ( c_sv_a ) ( 1 r)^3/2 ( 10 ^ 3 t ) ^1/2 ( mm_)^1/2 , and ~_ce _ en ( 810 ^ 17n)^1/2 ( v_ac_s ) , ~_ci ( 910 ^ 12n ) ^1/2 ( t10 ^ 3)^1/2 ( v_ac_s ) . under interstellar conditions",
    "@xmath54 is tiny , even though @xmath55 may be large .",
    "( note that in equation [ 13 ] , @xmath17 would be a characteristic interstellar length , not a disk thickness . ) in this case , neither the @xmath50 nor the @xmath51 term is important .",
    "but the ambipolar diffusion @xmath52 term may be non - negligible .",
    "this leads to a regime of ideal mhd in the ions , which then couple the magnetic field to the neutrals via ion - neutral collisions .",
    "in protostellar disks , our interest here , the far smaller ionization fraction can reduce @xmath56 to the point where resistivity can affect the dynamics .",
    "this reynolds number need not be of order unity in an mhd - turbulent fluid before it is significant ; some field configurations are affected when @xmath56 is larger than @xmath57 ( fleming , stone , & hawley 2000 ) . the key point here , however , is not the well - known result that resistivity is important in protostellar disks , it is the less appreciated fact that hemfs will generally be important in a magnetized disk whenever resistivity is .",
    "the two should be treated on the same footing ( w99 ) .",
    "the importance of the hall term relative to ohmic losses is noteworthy because it is surprisingly general . as formulated above , for a given ratio of magnetic to thermal energy , the relative importance of the hall term",
    "is _ independent _ of the ionization level , and depends only upon the number density of the dominant neutrals .",
    "furthermore , the relative importance of the hall term is not a feature unique to gases of low ionization fraction . using a nominal resistivity value of @xmath58 @xmath59 s@xmath60 for a fully ionized plasma ( spitzer 1962 )",
    ", we find ~_ce_ei 4 ( v_ac_s ) ( t10 ^ 5)^2 ( 10 ^ 16n)^1/2 , where @xmath61 is the electron - ion collision rate .",
    "we see that if ohmic dissipation is of interest ( as it would be for magnetic reconnection ) , the temperature and density regimes of ionized accretion disks imply that the hall effect can not be ignored .    at typical disk protostellar disk densities ,",
    "ambipolar diffusion can be neglected , though it may become important in the outermost regions of the disk . since = - b^2 ,",
    "if the currents and fields are perpendicular , ambipolar diffusion acts like a field - dependent resistivity .",
    "this is the case for the special vertical field geometry treated by w99 and in  4.2 below : all of ambipolar diffusion may be incorporated into an effective resistivity .",
    "but for the more general field geometries we consider , no such simplification is possible .",
    "we shall accordingly assume a neutral number density much in excess of @xmath62 @xmath9 , and ignore ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the form of the induction equation we shall use henceforth is [ finind ] t = ( - - c 4n_e e ) .",
    "hall currents introduce novel elements into the mhd of astrophysical disks , and to develop an intuitive understanding , we consider a very simple problem : hall - modified alfvn waves in a uniformly rotating disk threaded by a vertical magnetic field , @xmath63 . here",
    "we shall ignore finite resistivity and vertical structure , work in the boussinesq limit , and use standard cylindrical coordinates @xmath64 with the origin at the disk center . finally , we consider plane wave perturbations that depend only upon @xmath65 . linearized quantities ( indicated by @xmath66 notation ) are proportional to @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the angular frequency and @xmath23 is the vertical wave number",
    ".    under these circumstances , pressure , density , vertical velocity and vertical magnetic field perturbations all vanish .",
    "we solve for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the linearized radial and azimuthal equations of motion are [ aaa ] -i v_r - 2 v_- ikb4 b_r = 0 , [ bbb ] -i v_+ 2 v_r - ikb4 b_=0 .",
    "the same components of the linearized induction equation are -ib_r + k^2 bc4e n_e b_- ikb v_r = 0 , -i b_- k^2 bc4e n_e b_r - ikb v_= 0 , note the symmetry of the problem , in particular the introduction of a `` coriolis term '' into the magnetic field equations .",
    "these , of course , are the electromotive forces of the hall effect .",
    "the combination @xmath73 will be recognized by students of plasma physics as the electron whistler frequency . at characteristic wavenumbers satisfying @xmath74",
    ", this frequency is @xmath75 .",
    "hence , the ionization fraction below which the whistler branch couples with the disk dynamics is @xmath76 .",
    "the `` whistler drift '' of the field lines with respect to the bulk of the fluid is caused by the motion of the current - bearing electron charge carriers .",
    "perturbing the magnetic field induces local currents , and it is the electron motion in the currents relative to the ions that causes the field lines to move relative to the ion - neutral fluid .",
    "( recall that ambipolar diffusion is ignored , so the ions are locked with the neutrals . ) note the sense of the field line drift : if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are both upward ( say ) , the induced whistler circular motion of the field lines is right - handed , following the electrons , _ opposite _ to motion induced by the dynamical coriolis force .    how does all this affect the wave response of the fluid ? consider first the case of aligned @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "the sense of the field line motion is to slow the dynamical epicycles . the easiest way to see",
    "this is to note that in the absence of rotation , equations ( [ aaa ] ) and ( [ bbb ] ) show that the perturbed velocity vector is proportional to the perturbed magnetic field vector .",
    "the whistler waves would impart a circularly polarized component to the velocity response .",
    "this response is counter to the direction that the dynamical epicyclic motion is trying to impart , and hence it effectively lowers the coriolis force . as for the magnetic tension , the additional hall response is @xmath77 out - of - phase with respect to this force , and we therefore expect these two to add in quadrature . if , in addition , the dynamical epicycle is slowed by hall currents , the return magnetic tension force should effectively increase .",
    "if the field and angular velocity are counter aligned , the signs of these effects should switch .",
    "these expectations are born out in the dispersion relation , which is most transparently written [ disp1 ] ^2 2(1-k^2v^2_h/4 ^ 2 ) - k^2(v_a^2 + v_h^2 ) = 0 , where we have introduced the _ hall velocity _ defined by v_h^2 . note that",
    "although this quantity has dimensions of ( velocity)@xmath78 , _ it may be positive or negative .",
    "_ it is positive ( negative ) if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are oriented in the same ( opposite ) sense .",
    "we address more general orientations in subsequent sections .    in the dispersion relation ( [ disp1 ] ) , the upper @xmath79 sign corresponds to left - handed polarization relative to the magnetic field , the lower @xmath80 sign to right - handed polarization .",
    "whistler waves exist only for the right - handed branch , and correspond to the limit @xmath81 .",
    "there are no instabilities in a uniformly rotating disk , since there is no free energy source .",
    "we postpone until later sections ( which include differential rotation ) a full discussion of the solutions to the dispersion relation , but this is a convenient spot to make contact with waves in a magnetized plasma . in the limit @xmath82 , the dispersion relation becomes ^2 + k^2 v_a^2 = 0 , this is precisely the dispersion relation for a uniformly magnetized plasma with the displacement current and electron inertia ignored ( e.g. , krall & trivelpiece 1973 ) .",
    "( the alfvn speed in the above is dominated by the neutrals , whereas in standard fully ionized plasma treatments it is determined by the ions , of course . ) without loss of generality , we may take @xmath83 , allowing @xmath84 to determine the propagation direction .",
    "the positive frequency solutions are = + ( k^4 b^2 c^264 ^ 2 n_e^2 e^2 + k^2 v_a^2 ) ^1/2 . for small wavenumbers ( low frequencies ) both of the above solutions reduce to alfvn waves . at large wavenumbers , right - handed waves ( @xmath79 sign )",
    "go over to the high frequency whistler wave branch , whereas large @xmath23 left - handed waves ( @xmath80 sign ) are cut off at a frequency given by = ebc ( n_en ) = _ c ( n_en ) , analogous to the ion - cyclotron cut - off in a fully ionized plasma .",
    "the characteristic ionization fraction at which the cut - off frequency drops below the disk rotation frequency is once again @xmath85 .",
    "we consider next the local stability of a differentially rotating disk threaded by a weak vertical field .",
    "we assume that finite resistivity and hall currents are both present ; we neglect ambipolar diffusion . as in the previous section ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to plane wave disturbances of the form @xmath86 . in the boussinesq limit",
    ", this corresponds to fluid displacements in the plane of the disk , so vertical structure is unimportant .",
    "this problem has been considered by w99 , but it bears re - examination for several reasons .",
    "it is an important baseline for understanding the effects of hall currents in protostellar disks , and is worth understanding from more than one perspective .",
    "our approach emphasizes dynamical couplings rather than conductivity tensor formalism , and is physically quite distinct .",
    "it is also somewhat simpler .",
    "finally , we shall examine a qualitatively new feature of the hall effect that has not been discussed before : hemfs can destabilize _ outwardly _ increasing differential rotation . in the process",
    "we show that the maximum growth rate of the instability is always the local oort a value of the rotation ( in magnitude ) , whether the angular velocity is increasing or decreasing outward .        the key issue of the analysis is the local stability criterion of a disk with an axial field . whereas the dispersion relation is somewhat complex , the limit @xmath87 is simple , and this is relevant for understanding local stability .",
    "( in principle , local overstability may occur , but for self - consistency we wish to focus on nonpropagating , evanescent , local modes .",
    "for these , the transition between stability and instability must proceed through the point @xmath88 . )    including the effects of differential rotation and finite resistivity along with the hall terms , we find that the linearized , @xmath88 , radial and azimuthal equations of motion are now    [ ad ] - 2 v_- ikb4 b_r = 0 , [ ac ] ^2 2 v_r - ikb4 b_=0 , where @xmath89 is the epicyclic frequency , defined by ^2 = 4 ^ 2 + d^2dr .",
    "the same components of the linearized induction equation are [ ab ] k^2b_r + k^2 bc4e n_e b_- ikb v_r = 0 , [ aa ] k^2 b_- ( k^2 bc4e n_e + ddr ) b_r - ikb v_= 0 , notice that in equation ( [ aa ] ) , the whistler frequency hall term introduces a coupling that is equivalent to changing the shear rate @xmath90 .",
    "it arises becauses the @xmath91 component of the perturbed electron velocity ( @xmath92 ) differs from the dominant neutral velocity by a term involving @xmath93 .",
    "this produces a radial field component , @xmath71 .",
    "the effect is present whether or not there is differential rotation , but it is most striking when such motion is present , because it couples exactly like @xmath90 . in effect , it is the magnetic `` epicyclic '' term , combining a coriolis - like coupling with a background angular velocity gradient .",
    "if we ignore resistivity for the moment , our problem decouples into two very simple subproblems , one with @xmath70 coupled only to @xmath71 , and one with @xmath94 coupled only to @xmath95 .",
    "the torque must vanish , so equations ( [ ac ] ) and ( [ ab ] ) combine to give ( k^2 v_a^2 + ^2 k^2 v_h^24 ^ 2 ) b_= 0 , or the tidal and excess centrifugal forces must vanish , in which case equations ( [ ad ] ) and ( [ aa ] ) yield ( d^2dr + k^2 ( v_a^2 + v_h^2 ) ) b_r = 0 . if we are not to have a trivial solution , then ( v_a^2 + ^2 v_h^24 ^ 2 ) ( d^2dr + k^2 ( v_a^2 + v_h^2 ) ) = 0 . in the standard mri ,",
    "the torque is always purely alfvnic , and therefore it always has the same sign : a restoring negative torque for a positive angular displacement .",
    "this means that instability depends only upon the direction of the excess centrifugal force .",
    "the hall effect renders the problem more interesting , allowing an interplay between the torque and centrifugal force .",
    "inwardly _ directed centrifugal force can destabilize if accompanied by a positively directed torque .",
    "the inclusion of resistivity couples @xmath71 and @xmath72 , but gives only a slight modification to the above result : [ stab1 ] ( v_a^2 + ^2 v_h^24 ^ 2 ) ( d^2dr + k^2 ( v_a^2 + v_h^2 ) ) + ^2 ^2 k^2 = 0 .",
    "this is the desired critical stability condition . to determine the sign for instability",
    ", one may take the limit @xmath96 , which returns us to the simple mri .",
    "it then easily follows that the left hand side should be negative for instability , that is [ inequ ] k^2 v_a^2 < - where x is the dimensionless _ hall parameter . _ the terms in square brackets",
    "incorporate the additional physics of hemfs and resistivity ; they become unity for the standard @xmath97 mri ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) . the dimensionless resistivity parameter may be expressed in terms of the magnetic reynolds number : = ( ) ( c_sv_a ) re_m^-1 .",
    "the behavior of the polynomial d(x ) = ( 1+x ) ( 1 + ^2 x4",
    "^ 2 ) + ^2 ^ 2v_a^4 determines the nature of the instability . we may write the instability criterion [ fifty ] sgn(d ) k^2 v_a^2 < - ( 1 + ^2 x/4 ^ 2 ) d^2/dr |d| .",
    "it is not difficult to show that if [ window ] re_m^-1 < 14 ( ^2 ^ 2 ) ( v_ac_s ) | d^2dr| there will be a finite range of @xmath98 for which @xmath99 . in this window ,",
    "all wavenumbers , no matter how large , are unstable , even in the presence of resistivity : the right hand side of the inequality ( [ inequ ] ) is positive , while the left hand side is negative . clearly , the zeroes of @xmath100 are critical for understanding the behavior of disks in the hall regime .    for a keplerian disk ,",
    "the window occurs when @xmath98 falls approximately between @xmath101 and @xmath102 for large @xmath56 .",
    "roughly speaking , there is a match between the response frequency of the magnetic tension and the `` epicyclic '' frequency of the field line drift through the fluid caused by hemfs .",
    "these tend to cancel each other s dynamical response .",
    "qualitatively , it is as though the restoring tension were not present as a radial force , leaving the destabilizing dynamical tide to do its work . within the window , going to larger wavenumbers does not change the sign of the radial forces on a fluid element .",
    "the azimuthal torque , however , is still dominated by the alfvn term , and this allows for angular momentum transfer .    in figure ( [ wfig1 ] ) , we show a stability plot for an @xmath103 keplerian disk in the @xmath104 plane .",
    "the shaded regions correspond to instability .",

    "this corresponds to resistive stabilization . in general",
    ", when resistivity becomes dominant , the instability criterion ( [ fifty ] ) leads to @xmath109 .",
    "but the the right hand side of the inequality is a function of @xmath98 , and at its maximum we find @xmath110 .",

    "it is straightforwardly proven in the limit of vanishing resistivity that @xmath138 leads to stability ( since the analysis reduces to the roots of a quadratic ) , and the presence or resistivity will almost certainly cause further stabilization .",
    "numerical analyses are all consistent with ( [ genins ] ) as a necessary and sufficient criterion for instability .",
    "the most important difference between strictly axial geometry and the present calculation lies with the form of the coupling of the hall term and wavenumber . whereas the axial result makes it appear that the hall term stabilizes or destabilizes according to whether @xmath139 is positive or negative , equations ( [ gendisp])([gendisppp ] )",

    "the significance of this form of the coupling is that under conditions of marginal stability , if there is any finite radial field component , there will _ always _ be wavenumbers which make this term negative ( destabilizing ) .",

    "then , a necessary condition for instability is [ necc ] ( ) ^2 + c k_z ( ) 2 e n_e < - k_z^2k^2 d^2dr , which differs from the standard mri only by an additive hall term on the left hand side .",
    "( this is a necessary condition because it omits resistivity . )",
    "the effect of this is shown schematically in figure ( 7 ) .",
    "we have introduced the dimensionless hall parameter , ha , the characteristic whistler frequency normalized to @xmath15 .",
    "let us finally note that hemfs will tend to stabilize geometries with vanishing axial field . in the absence of the hall term , the standard @xmath142 mri , has its maximum growth rate for disturbances with @xmath143 . but with hall emfs included , arbitrarily large axial wavenumbers will not allow @xmath144 . instead , these modes become stable waves .",
    "one of the most important reasons for obtaining this general axisymmetric formula ( [ gendisp ] ) is that it provides a basis for understanding the behavior of local _ nonaxisymmetric _ disturbances , to which we now turn .",
    "we shall work in the local shearing coordinate system introduced by goldreich & lynden - bell ( 1965 ) in their pioneering study of local gravitational disk instabilities , and used in a magnetic context by balbus & hawley ( 1992b ) and terquem & papaloizou ( 1996 ) .",

    "in essence , we find that the nonaxisymmetric evolution unfolds as a series of axisymmetric problems . in going from axisymmetry to nonaxisymmetry , the only term in the @xmath119 stability criterion that acquires a time - dependence is @xmath23 .",
    "consider the evolution of a strongly leading disturbance , @xmath147 large and negative .",
    "as @xmath147 initially moves towards zero , the factor @xmath158 goes from much less than , to nearly unity ( assuming @xmath159 is small ) . the right hand side of ( [ necc ] ) starts out very small , and grows to its maximum value of @xmath160 . at this stage ,",
    "the formal instability criterion must be satisfied , or it will never be satisfied over the entire course of the evolution . then , as @xmath147 grows from zero to large and positive , the right hand side of ( [ necc ] ) once again diminishes with time , and eventually the flow will stabilize .",
    "the situation is summarized in figure  ( [ fig1 ] ) , which shows the stability and instability regions of a keplerian disk in the @xmath161 plane .",
    "we have adopted the nominal values @xmath162 and @xmath163 , and for comparison have also displayed the magnetorotational instability results ( @xmath164 ) of balbus & hawley ( 1992b ) . note that despite the complexity of the full system of equations , in the end the hemf simply slides the hyperbolic stability curve up and down along the ordinate . since @xmath165 is constant ,",
    "the evolving path of a perturbation is along a horizontal line in this plane , since only the abscissa coordinate changes with time .",
    "the nature of the unstable response is then determined entirely by how long this horizontal trajectory remains inside the instability region .    in figure  ( [ fig2 ] ) , both the hall effect and resistivity are included . from equations ( [ inst1 ] ) and ( [ inst2 ] )",
    ", we see that the marginal stability curves in the @xmath166 plane depend on the resistivity only through the parameter @xmath167 .",
    "we have adopted @xmath168 . to orient oneself",
    ", this would correspond to a disk with aspect ratio @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 .",
    "we see clearly in figure  ( [ fig2 ] ) that the resistivity stabilizes small radial wavelengths . in figure  ( [ fig3 ] ) , to allow for direct comparison , we have plotted both the resistive and nonresistive cases .",
    "figures  ( [ fig1])([fig3 ] ) have been obtained strictly by numerically solving equations  ( [ nax1 ] ) and ( [ nax2 ] ) . nevertheless , each of these curves is almost indistinguishable from those obtained simply by setting @xmath172 , where @xmath119 is defined by ( [ inst1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , although the criterion ( [ inst2 ] ) has been derived for axisymmetric perturbations , it is very accurate for nonaxisymmetric disturbances also , with @xmath173 varying with time .",
    "note that the curves displayed in figures  ( [ fig1])([fig3 ] ) depend on @xmath174 only implicitly , through the ratio @xmath173 .",
    "the role of @xmath174 is limited to determining the evolution of @xmath173 , not the properties of the stability curves .    in figure  ( [ fig4 ] ) , we show the evolution of the perturbed radial field @xmath71 ( the curves for @xmath175 and @xmath176 are similar ) for the same @xmath177 values as above , and for both @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "the value of @xmath180 is chosen because it lies in the unstable regime for an axisymmetric @xmath122 disk , for all the hall parameters .",
    "initially @xmath173 is very nearly unity , and the perturbation grows until the wavevector moves out of the relevant unstable region in the @xmath181 plane . when @xmath178 , explosive growth is achieved for the three values of @xmath177 considered . as expected , the cases @xmath162 and @xmath163 are respectively more and less unstable than the case @xmath164 .",
    "the effect of the resistivity is to suppress the growth of the perturbation at large wavenumbers , corresponding to very early and very late times in the evolution .",
    "the dramatic reduction of peak amplitudes is evident .",
    "the @xmath182 case , however , remains quite unstable even with @xmath183 .    to conclude",

    "( large @xmath174 disturbances are stable . ) whether growth occurs or not depends upon the instantaneous location of the wavenumber in the @xmath185 plane .",
    "shear causes the wavenumber to retrace a horizontal line in this plane , first from right to left ( for an initially leading distrubance ) , then the reverse .",
    "if this path takes the wavenumber into an _ axisymmetrically _ unstable zone , the disturbance grows .",
    "the effect of resistivity , not surprisingly , is to dampen growth , with the smallest wavelengths being the most affected .",
    "in a gas which is at least partially ionized , the magnetic field is , but for resistivity , frozen into the electron fluid .",
    "the difference in the mean electron velocity and the center - of - mass fluid velocity gives rise to hemfs in the gas .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , in astrophysical environments these can often be more important than ohmic dissipation , even in a fully ionized plasma .",
    "this point is often not appreciated . in protostellar disks ,",
    "the hall effect is small compared with resistivity only if the _ neutral _",
    "density is much in excess of @xmath186 @xmath187 , or if @xmath188 .",
    "the dynamical consequence of hemfs is the appearance of whistler waves as a mode of the gas response .",
    "these waves are carried nominally by the electrons , but inductive electron - ion coupling and ion - neutral collisional coupling together assure that the bulk of the fluid is involved .",
    "it is the interplay between these right - handed circularly polarized whistlers and the coriolis driven epicycles that affects the stability of magnetized disks .",
    "whistler waves become dynamically important when the ionization fraction drops below @xmath189 .",
    "the hall effect allows disks with either decreasing outward or increasing outward angular velocity profiles to become unstable . by way of contrast",
    ", the standard mri affects only those disks with a decreasing outward profile , even though any angular velocity gradient increases the rotation energy for fixed angular momentum .",
    "the maximum growth rate is always found to be the oort a value , @xmath190 .    whether hemfs stabilize or destabilize a disk depends not upon @xmath1 , but upon @xmath191 .",
    "the latter should be negative for destabilization .",
    "if @xmath3 has a radial component , then it is always possible to find a wavenumber to make this parameter whatever value is desired .",
    "thus , hall physics will always tend to make some wavenumbers more unstable .",
    "whether or not the disk actually become unstable will depend on the value of the resistivity .",
    "the nonlinear consequences of hemfs are likely to be particularly important for our understanding of transitions between active and quiescent states in both dwarf novae and fu orionis outbursts .",
    "neither of these systems is presently understood at a fundamental level .",
