    "are the dark matter halos of lsb galaxies `` cuspy '' nfw halos , or are they `` cored '' isothermal halos ?",
    "nfw halos can be fit to the observations , but the cosmological parameters implied by the fits are inconsistent with the standard lcdm picture .",
    "isothermal halos provide much better fits , but they have no cosmological dependence or theoretical basis .",
    "we address this question with new data that is both high resolution and two - dimensional .",
    "we observed 12 lsb galaxies using the densepak integrated field unit on the wiyn telescope at kitt peak .",
    "densepak is comprised of 3  diameter fibers arranged in a 43  @xmath1 28  rectangle .",
    "velocities of the h@xmath2 , [ ] @xmath36584 , [ ] @xmath36717 , and [ ] @xmath36731  emission lines were measured in each fiber .",
    "rotation curves were derived from the two - dimensional velocity fields using the nemo program rotcur .",
    "we combined the densepak rotation curves with previous longslit and hi   curves .",
    "we fit the combined data with isothermal and nfw@xmath4 halos .",
    "we also fit an nfw@xmath5 halo which was required to match the velocities at the outer radii of each galaxy , in effect , constraining the concentrations to agree with cosmology .",
