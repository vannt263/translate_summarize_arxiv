    "this work deals with two apparently unrelated , main topics in the study of planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "the first one is the role of binary evolution , which is the favoured explanation of the diverse morphologies displayed by pne ( e.g. @xcite ) , but which may even be the cause of their mere existence @xcite .",
    "the second issue is the so - called _ abundance discrepancy problem_. it is well known ( see e.g. osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) that in photoionized nebulae  both pne and h  ii regions  optical recombination lines ( orls ) provide abundance values that are systematically larger than those obtained using collisionally excited lines ( cels ) .",
    "this a long - standing problem in nebular astrophysics , and has obvious implications on the measurement of the chemical content of the universe , often done using cels from emission regions and the ism . the _ abundance discrepancy factor _ ( _ adf _ ) between orls and cels is usually between 1.5 and 3 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but in pne it has a significant tail extending to much larger values .",
    "the nebula with the largest known _ adf _",
    "( @xmath370 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is hf  22 , which has a close binary central star @xcite .    in our recent study of the new galactic pn iphasxj211420.0 + 434136",
    "( ou5 ) , which also has a binary central star @xcite , we noticed the unusual strength of recombination lines such as c  ii4267    and the 4650    o  ii+n  iii  blend .",
    "this points to large _",
    "values also in this object , as well as in other binary pne such as abell  46 @xcite and abell  63 @xcite in which strong c  ii  emission was detected @xcite .",
    "the short orbital periods , between 8 and 11 hours , indicate that the central stars of these pne have gone through a common  envelope ( ce ) phase in their previous evolution .",
    "therefore , we decided to obtain deep spectroscopy of these three nebulae to investigate whether the abundance discrepancy problem in pne is in some way related to the binary nature of their central stars . that this is indeed true is demonstrated by the results presented in the following .",
    "h@xmath9+n  ii  images of a  46 and a  63 were retrieved from the archives of the isaac newton group of telescopes and eso .",
    "the image of a  46 is an 1-hr exposure from the 2.5 m  isaac newton telescope on la palma obtained in 2008 with the wide field camera ( pixel size 0.33 ) .",
    "seeing was 1.0 fwhm .",
    "the image of a  63 was obtained in 1995 at the 3.5 m eso / ntt with emmi ( exposure time 30  min , pixel size 0.27 , seeing 0.9 ) .",
    "the image of ou5 is the one described in @xcite .",
    "the inner regions of the nebulae are displayed in figure  [ f - neb ] .",
    "spectra of a  46 , a  63 and ou5 were obtained on august 1618 2014 with the 4.2 m wht telescope and the double - arm isis spectrograph .",
    "the long slit of isis was opened to 1  width and positioned through the brightest parts of the nebulae as indicated in figure  [ f - neb ] and in table  [ t-4neb ] . in the blue arm of isis ,",
    "grating r1200b was used , providing a dispersion of 0.22    pix@xmath7 and a resolution of 0.8   . in the red arm ,",
    "grating r316r gave a dispersion of 0.92    pix@xmath7 , and a resolution of 3.4   .",
    "two different grating tilts were adopted in different nights in order to have a global wavelength coverage from 3610 to 5050    in the blue , and from 5400 to 9150    in the red , with little vignetting at the wavelength ends .",
    "the spatial scale was @xmath10  pix@xmath7 in the blue , and @xmath11  pix@xmath7 in the red .",
    "depending on the wavelength setting , total exposure times were of 2 hours for a  46 , 2 to 3.3 hours for a  63 , and 2 to 4.7 hours for ou5 .",
    "the spectrophotometric standards bd+28  4211 , bd+33  2642 , and feige 110 from @xcite , and hr  718 from @xcite were observed for flux calibration .",
    "seeing varied significantly during observations , and only data obtained with a seeing value @xmath12@xmath13 fwhm were retained .",
    "images and spectra were reduced using packages _ ccdred _ and _ twodspec _ in iraf .",
    "to increase the signal from these low surface brightness nebulae , 1-d spectra were extracted by integrating all the nebular emission included in the long slit . note",
    "that in a  46 , at the position indicated by the arrow in figure  [ f - neb ] , the slit intersects an elongated knot . in the spectra",
    ", this feature clearly stands out for its strong [ n  ii ] 6548,6583 , [ s  ii ] 6716,6731 , and more moderate [ o  ii ] 3726,3729 emission relative to the surrounding nebula , from which it seems to be blue - shifted by @xmath1410  km  s@xmath7",
    ". it could be a low - ionization small - scale structure ( lis ) as often found in pne @xcite .",
    "other similar blobs are seen in the image , but it should also be noted that the field is also rich in small background galaxies . this feature does not affect the following analysis , and is not considered any further in this work .    figure  [ f - spectra ] shows an illustrative portion of the spectra of the nebulae , in a wavelength range where some of the most relevant orls and cels are located .",
    "emission - line fluxes were measured by means of multi - gaussian fit using _",
    "splot_. both in the blue and red , fluxes measured in the two spectrograph settings were rescaled using the emission lines in the overlapping spectral range .",
    "the flux differences in these overlapping lines ( after scaling ) were used to estimate the errors in the flux measurement .",
    "identification of the observed lines , their fluxes and errors are presented in table  [ t - fluxes ] .",
    "all line fluxes are normalised to h@xmath15=100 , where the observed h@xmath15  flux integrated along the slit is 3.53@xmath1610@xmath17 , 1.80@xmath1610@xmath17 , and 1.37@xmath1610@xmath17 erg  @xmath18  s@xmath7 for a  46 , a  63 , and ou5 , respectively .",
    "the nebular reddening was computed from the hydrogen line ratios , specifically the balmer h@xmath9 , h@xmath15 , h@xmath19 , and h@xmath20  lines and the paschen 103 , 11 - 3 and 123 transitions .",
    "the reddening law of @xcite was adopted .",
    "the theoretical hydrogen line ratios have a small but non - negligible dependence on the electron density and temperature @xmath21  and @xmath2 .",
    "as discussed below , in addition to a standard nebular component at @xmath2@xmath310@xmath4  k , in these nebulae there is evidence for a much colder component at @xmath1410@xmath5  k , as for instance indicated by the balmer jump in a  46 ( sect .",
    "[ s - physchem ] ) .",
    "we therefore computed the reddening by adopting either @xmath2=12500  k , characteristic of the cels , or @xmath2=1000  k , as suggested by the orls indicators .",
    "the mean values of the logarithmic extinction at h@xmath15  of each nebula ( @xmath22(h@xmath15 ) ) are listed in table  [ t - phys1 ] for both temperature assumptions .",
    "those derived using the cels temperature are 0.17  dex larger , and in good agreement with the previous estimates by @xcite and @xcite , as expected considering that they were determined under the same assumption . in the case of a  46 , they are also consistent with the reddening maps of @xcite , which indicate a total foreground dust column corresponding to @xmath22(h@xmath15)=0.17 . in the following ,",
    "we conservatively use the @xmath22(h@xmath15 )  values determined with the cels temperature to deredden the observed line fluxes , as the orls temperature are more uncertain , especially for a  63 and ou5 .",
    "however , we also repeated the whole analysis with the lower @xmath22(h@xmath15 )  values resulting from the orls temperature .",
    "differences in the results are small and do not affect our conclusions .",
    "errors on the dereddened fluxes includes the contribution of the uncertainty in the @xmath22(h@xmath15 )  value .",

    "the computations of physical conditions were done with pyneb @xcite , a python based package that allows derivation of the physical conditions and ionic and elemental abundances from emission lines .",

    ", we adopted the weighted average of @xmath21([o  ii ] ) and @xmath21([s  ii ] ) for a  46 and a  63 , and of @xmath21([o  ii ] ) , @xmath21([s  ii ] ) and @xmath21([ar  iv ] ) for ou5 .",
    "note that the main results are almost independent on the assumed @xmath21 .",
    "the intensity of the auroral [ n  ii ] @xmath235755 line and the trans - auroral [ o  ii ] @xmath23@xmath237320 + 30 lines were corrected for the contribution of recombination using equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in @xcite .",
    "a preliminary calculation of the n@xmath0/h@xmath1 and o@xmath0/h@xmath1 abundance ratios by means of n  ii multiplet 3 and o  ii multiplet 1 was used to compute the recombination contribution to [ n  ii]5755 and [ o  ii ] 7320 + 30 , respectively .",
    "this resulted ( table  [ t - recombcontrib ] ) in relatively small corrections for the [ n  ii ] line flux , but very large corrections for the [ o  ii ] line fluxes .",
    "this means that @xmath2  from the corresponding temperature diagnostics would be lower than computed neglecting recombination . in particular , the fact that recombination dominates the trans - auroral [ o  ii ] emission ( 100%  in a  46 and ou5 , and 56%  in a  63 ) , no reliable @xmath2  estimation can be derived using these lines",

    "the values obtained for @xmath2 with and without recombination correction are summarized in table  [ t - phys1 ] .",
    "owing to the large uncertainties in @xmath2([n  ii ] ) and @xmath2([o  ii ] ) , and considering the overall high excitation of the nebulae , we finally adopted @xmath2([o  iii ] ) as representative of the whole nebula , ( see table  [ t - phys1 ] and discussion below ) .    to test whether in these nebulae part of the orls emission comes from a cold , high - metallicity gas component ( e.g.",
    "* ) , we also checked some @xmath2 diagnostics from orls .",
    "unfortunately , the most widely used diagnostics , that is the ratio between the balmer discontinuity at 3646    and the balmer decrement ratio , could only be measured in a  46 ( figure  [ f - a46bal ] ) . in this nebula ,",
    "the balmer continuum temperature ( in k ) was determined following the equation by @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the he@xmath1/h@xmath1 and he@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratios respectively , and @xmath29/h11 is the ratio of the discontinuity of the balmer jump in erg @xmath18 s@xmath7",

    "additionally , for a  46 we could measure the @xmath2 sensitive ratio o  ii 4089/4649 @xcite . as it can be seen in table  [ t - phys1 ] , all these diagnostics give values of the electron temperature that are much lower than those derived from cels diagnostics .",
    "all this clearly points to the presence of a nebular component of cold ionized gas where most of the orl emission arise , as it has been claimed by e.g. @xcite .",

    "this is the value that we finally adopt as representative of the o@xmath0/h@xmath1 orls abundance ratio ( table  [ t - ionic ] ) .    additionally , we computed the @xmath21 that minimizes the dispersion of individual abundances obtained from the o  ii multiplet 1 lines .",

    "finally , in ou5 we also computed the o@xmath1/h@xmath1 orls ratio ( see table  [ t - ionic ] ) , as we detected an emission line that we identify as the blend of three o  i orls at @xmath37772   ( see tab  [ t - fluxes ] ) .",
    "these lines are hardly detected in deep emission spectra of other pne and h  ii regions , mainly because they are intrinsically faint and frequently blended with strong telluric emission lines ( which is not the case in the spectrum of ou5 ) .",

    "it is clear that the _ adf_s  of these nebulae and especially in a  46 and ou5 are very large , independently of adopting or not a correction for recombination in the calculation of @xmath2 . a detailed discussion on the possible origins of the large _",
    "adf_s  of these objects , the largest ones found in pne and two orders of magnitude larger than in h  ii  regions , is presented in sect .",

    "total abundances are presented in table  [ t - totab ] .",
    "the low surface brightness of these nebulae does not allow us to study in detail spatial variations of the chemical abundances and _ adf_s .",
    "useful insights can however be gained by inspecting the spatial distribution of selected cels and orls along the spectrograph slit .",
    "they are presented in figs .",
    "[ f - a46prof ] and [ f - ou5prof ] for a  46 and ou5 . to decrease the noise in the faintest emission lines , profiles were smoothed with a boxcar average of 5 pixels ( 1 ) width for a  46 , and 3 pixels ( 0.6 ) for ou5 .",
    "profiles have been arbitrarily scaled in flux to plot all lines using the same display .",
    "a  63 is not shown because of the low s / n of several of these lines .    in the light of h@xmath9  ( figure  [ f - neb ] ) ,",
    "a  46 looks amorphous and diffuse .",
    "even so , its brightest regions seem to trace the outline of a low surface brightness inner `` cavity '' with a bipolar shape whose long axis is approximately oriented at position angle p.a.=45 .",
    "figure  [ f - a46prof ] shows that hi , he  i  and strong cels such as [ o  iii ] 4959 have a similar spatial distribution that follows what is seen in figure  [ f - neb ] . on the other hand , the orls emission , illustrated by c  ii 4267 and o  ii 4649 , peaks in the innermost regions , inside the low surface brightness h@xmath9  `` cavity '' .",
    "their peak is indicated by a green cross in figure  [ f - neb ] .",
    "this central enhancement is a standard characteristic of the orls abundances @xcite .",
    "most of the fluctuations observed in the orls spatial profiles are noise in these faint lines , which prevents the detection of small - scale spatial variations such as for instance done by @xcite in ngc  7009 .",
    "more puzzling is the behaviour of the auroral line [ o  iii ] 4363 , which shows a very similar spatial distribution to the orls , even if its peak is displaced to the west by a couple of arcseconds .",
    "the marked difference between the [ o  iii ] 4959 and [ o  iii ] 4363 spatial profiles apparently indicates that @xmath2([o  iii ] ) decreases from 20000  k in the innermost regions to 11000  k in the outer parts .",
    "however , in the previous section we have shown that auroral lines can be significantly affected by recombination .",
    "table  [ t - recombcontrib ] provides some crude estimates for the integrated spectrum , but the actual contribution of recombination to each line as a function of position can only be roughly estimated with the present data .",
    "the spatial profile of [ o  iii ] 7330 , whose emission should be dominated by recombination , is also very similar to that of the orls and qualitatively supports the hypothesis that at least part of the apparent @xmath2([o  iii ] ) radial gradient could be spuriously produced by variable contribution of recombination to the auroral lines .",
    "this is confirmed by the following exercise .",
    "we extracted the spectrum within 7 arcsec of the orls peak in the spatial profiles of a  46 .",
    "even if some line fluxes are one order of magnitude smaller than in the integrated spectra , most of the critical lines could be measured . by proceeding as for the integrated spectra , 48%  of the [ o  iii]4363 flux",
    "is estimated to be produced by recombination and was corrected accordingly . the value @xmath2([o",
    "iii])=17800@xmath301900  k that would be obtained by neglecting recombination is then lowered to 12950@xmath301150  k when it is instead taken into account . a @xmath2(o  ii  v1/f1 ) of 3840@xmath30200  k",
    "is computed , which is only slightly lower than for the integrated spectrum .",
    "densities are about twice as high , namely @xmath21([s  ii])= 560@xmath35 cm@xmath6 and @xmath21([o  ii])=5750@xmath36 cm@xmath6 .",
    "total abundances determined from cels only vary slightly compared to those found using the integrated spectrum .",
    "but , as far as the o@xmath0 abundance is concerned , the cels abundance slightly decreases to 7.70@xmath300.11 while the orl one more markedly increases to 10.21@xmath37 .",
    "this results in an _",
    "adf_(o@xmath0 ) over 300 in the inner regions of a  46 !    ou5 , which has a clean bipolar geometry @xcite , shows similar results ( figure  [ f - ou5prof ] ) .",
    "hi , he  i , [ o  iii]4959 , and [ n  ii]6583 have a similar spatial distribution , peaking at the limb - brightened edges of the bipolar lobes .",
    "on the other hand , orls such as c  ii  and o  ii , as well the auroral lines of [ o  iii ]  and [ o  ii ]  are more concentrated toward the center , and are mutually similar .",
    "therefore recombination should be carefully considered when the auroral lines are used to determine the physico - chemical conditions in this kind of nebulae .",
    "a  63 and ou5 were observed by the iphas h@xmath9  photometric survey of the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "therefore their iphas h@xmath9+[n  ii ]  images can be flux calibrated using the information in the iphas second data release @xcite .",
    "the observed , total h@xmath9  fluxes of these nebulae , after removing the contribution of [ n  ii]6548,6583 to the iphas h@xmath9  filter using our spectroscopy , are listed in table  [ t-4neb ] .",
    "errors are of the order of 10% . taking advantage of the fact that the image of a  46 in figure  [ f - neb ] was obtained with the same instrumentation and filter in a clear night , we adopted the mean value of the zeropoint of the iphas survey to also calibrate this image .",
    "the additional error introduced by this assumption is another 10% .    with the total h@xmath9  flux and the physical parameters determined from spectroscopy , and adopting the distances quoted in table  [ t-4neb ] ,",
    "the nebular ionized mass can be estimated .",
    "the total ionized mass of hydrogen was computed by applying the expression : @xmath38 where @xmath39(h@xmath15 ) is the dereddened h@xmath15 flux , d is the distance to the object , @xmath40 is the proton mass , @xmath21 is the electron density , @xmath41 is the energy of an h@xmath15 photon and , finally , @xmath42(@xmath43 , @xmath2 ) is the effective recombination coefficient of h@xmath15 . the usual dependence on the square of the distance appears in the formula . in this respect",
    ", it should be noted that the distances of a  46 and a  63 were originally computed through the stellar parameters of the central binaries , which should provide more reliable determinations than any statistical method , especially when the peculiar nature of these nebulae is considered .    as @xmath44@xmath2@xmath45 ,",
    "the total mass is roughly proportional to the adopted electron temperature @xmath2  and inversely proportional to the electron density @xmath21 .",
    "the dual - component nature of these nebulae prevents a precise mass determination , as the relative amounts of hi  emitting at the low @xmath2  indicated by the balmer jump and the he  i  or o  ii  orls , and that emitting at the much higher cels @xmath2  is not known . strictly speaking , at least for a  46 one",
    "would be tempted to consistently adopt for hydrogen the temperature computed using the balmer jump , namely 1000  k. as with densities , there is also a clear difference ( by up to a factor of 8) between those computed from [ o  ii ]  and those computed from [ s  ii ] . assuming @xmath2=1000  k and the average @xmath21   from cels , we determine an h@xmath1 mass of 1@xmath1610@xmath6 , 5@xmath1610@xmath46 , and 5@xmath1610@xmath6  m@xmath8  for a  46 , a  63 , and ou5 , respectively .",
    "however , even if the total amount of metals in the hot and cold gas phases is comparable as for instance estimated for hf  22 @xcite , the much higher metallicity of the cold component implies that the majority of hydrogen must be in the hot component .",
    "it seems therefore reasonable to adopt @xmath2([o  iii ] ) , which would imply h@xmath1 masses almost one order of magnitude larger , namely 8@xmath1610@xmath6 , 4@xmath1610@xmath6 , and 5@xmath1610@xmath47  m@xmath8  for a  46 , a  63 , and ou5 , respectively .    finally , in the less likely case that all hydrogen comes from a plasma with @xmath2([o  iii ] ) and the lowest electron density measured ( @xmath21([s  ii ] ) )",

    "these should be just taken as conservative upper limits to the total amount of h@xmath1 in these nebulae ( for the adopted distances ) .",
    "@xcite found a similarly low h@xmath1 mass of 1.4@xmath1610@xmath47  m@xmath8  for hf  22 .",
    "therefore , in spite of the large uncertainties in these calculations , the clear conclusion is that these nebulae with large _",
    "adf_s  and close binary central stars have a very small total ionized mass , one or more orders of magnitudes lower than typical of galactic pne ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the total nebular mass could in principle be larger if part of it is in neutral / molecular form .",
    "however , spectral indicators such as the absence of [ o  i]6300 emission @xcite , which is thought to be produced at the interface between ionized and neutral gas via charge exchange reactions , point to optically thin , density bounded nebulae .",
    "two of the three pne that we studied , namely a  46 and ou5 , have abundance discrepancy factors that are among the largest ones found in pne .",
    "in particular , a  46 has the largest _ adf _  ever measured , with the exception of the hydrogen - deficient knots that are directly observed in abell 30 @xcite .",
    "our third target , a  63 , has a lower _ adf _  ( @xmath310 ) , but still above the average value in pne .",
    "our three target pne have close binary central stars with orbital periods around ten hours .",
    "therefore these observations , together with the additional case of hf  22 @xcite , reveal a clear connection between the most extreme representatives of the abundance discrepancy problem and the binarity of the central sources .",
    "the abovementioned abell 30 ( and the morphologically similar abell  58 aka v605  aquilae , which experienced a nova - like outburst in 1905 ) were also proposed to contain a close binary @xcite , but no direct evidence has been found yet .    our spectroscopic analysis supports the previous interpretation that two different gas phases coexist in these nebulae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : hot gas at 10@xmath4  k with standard metallicity where the cels can be efficiently excited , and a much cooler ( 10@xmath5  k ) plasma with a highly enhanced content of heavy element abundances ( which cause the cooling ) where only orls form .",
    "how much each component contributes to the total mass , and how they are distributed and mixed , is poorly known , because existing data are not able to spatially resolve them .",
    "one common characteristic , also shared by the nebulae studied in this work , is that the orls emission is enhanced in the central regions of the nebulae , where the _ adf _  reaches a value over 300 in a  46 .",
    "@xcite estimated that similar amounts of metals are in the hot and cold gas of hf  22 , but the amount of h and he in each component can not be determined .",
    "this prevents the calculation of precise x@xmath48/h@xmath1 abundances for each gas phase individually @xcite , and therefore all values in table  [ t - totab ] should be taken with caution .",
    "for instance , the large helium content that is measured in a  63 and ou5 may not be completely real ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "only ionic abundance ratios , such as for example n@xmath1/o@xmath1 , are free of this bias . in this respect",
    "a  46 , and to a lesser extent a  63 ( because of its large errors ) and ou5/o@xmath1 ratio for this nebula computed by @xcite was caused by the use of the auroral [ o  ii]7320,7730 lines , that we have shown here to be severely affected by recombination processes .",
    "] , have low n@xmath1/o@xmath1@xmath14n / o cels abundance ratios , typical of low - metallicity smc pne , or alternately indicating substantial oxygen enhancement compared to nitrogen .",
    "but even this ratio should be taken with caution , considering the high excitation of the nebulae .",
    "we have also noticed that cels temperature gradients within a nebula can be at least partly spurious , caused by a varying contribution of recombination to the emission of the auroral lines .",
    "this additional uncertainty also affects the determination of the cels abundances .",
    "the main result of this work is that any explanation of the abundance discrepancy problem must include the fact that _",
    "the most pathological cases are planetary nebulae with a close binary central star .",
    "_ this casts light on the origin of the problem .",
    "let s consider previously proposed and new scenarios , and their _ pro et contra_.    a key point to understand the evolution of these systems is the small ionized mass of the nebulae ( sect .",
    "[ s - mass ] ) .",
    "let s take 10@xmath47  m@xmath8  as a representative figure of the nebular mass for the systems that we have considered .",
    "the total mass in the high - metallicity component would then be a ( likely small ) fraction of it .",
    "these low masses dispute the usual interpretation of the origin of these nebulae .",
    "it is generally thought that pne with close binary central stars went through a common - envelope phase when the radius of the primary star increased in the agb phase and engulfed the companion .",
    "the ce interaction caused the shrinkage of the orbit to the current small separations ( @xmath32  r@xmath8  for the four objects in table  [ t-4neb ] ) and provoked the complete ejection of the envelope , forming the pn .",
    "however , the nebular masses that we have estimated are far too low compared to the agb envelope masses expected for 0.5 - 0.6  m@xmath8  cores and standard initial - to - final mass relationships , even if some mass loss prior to the agb is allowed @xcite .",
    "the exercise has been done by @xcite and @xcite for a  46 and a  63 , for which stellar parameters are known ( table  [ t-4neb ] ) . in @xcite , consistency between the stellar evolution and binary parameters is reached for ce masses of 0.4  m@xmath8  for a  46 and 1.2  m@xmath8  for a  63 , i.e. one to three orders of magnitude larger , respectively , than what we measured .",
    "the similar or only slightly larger nebular masses of ou5 and hf  22 add strength to this conclusion , even if the stellar parameters for these two systems are not precisely known .",
    "this missing - mass problem is even more severe considering that the whole ce is thought to be ejected in a very short timescale ( @xmath3few years , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , limiting the possibility that the pn is dispersed over a large volume .",
    "as it is evident that the systems at some point went through a ce phase ( given the present small orbital separation ) , the envelope of the primary star would have been ejected a long time ago and would have now vanished in the interstellar medium .",
    "note that the @xmath49  m@xmath8  mass of the central star of a  46 is at the limit between rgb and agb core masses .",
    "it can not be excluded that in this case ( but can be ruled out for a  63 which has a typical agb core mass of 0.63  m@xmath8 ) the ce interaction , ejection , and orbital shrinking occurred in the rgb phase of the primary .    then the currently observed low ",
    "mass nebulae would be produced much after the ce phase , in post  ce mass loss episodes when the massive agb envelope has already dispersed .",
    "even so , their central stars have to be still hot and luminous to be able to ionize the nebulae , as it is indeed observed ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this hypothesis has been discussed in several articles @xcite . in general , thermal pulses in the post  agb phase are expected to be relatively frequent @xcite . in",
    "the best studied case , sakurai s object , the estimated ejected mass is 2@xmath1610@xmath6  m@xmath8  @xcite , i.e. , in the possible range of what we have measured .",
    "gas falling back from the ejected envelope , accreting on the post - agb star , and perhaps triggering a vltp was predicted and discussed by , e.g. , @xcite . in those specific calculations , however , the total amount of fallback material , 10@xmath50 to 10@xmath6  m@xmath8 , seems on the low side of what we observed , and the timescale for accretion is too short to allow the massive , ejected ce to vanish completely .",
    "the vltp ejecta are expected to basically represent the intershell abundances , with c / o@xmath511 . in the case of ou5 , the orl c / o ratio could be estimated as c / o=@xmath52(c@xmath0/o@xmath0 ) , where @xmath52=1.12 is the icf from @xcite that could be consistently computed using the orl o@xmath53 and o@xmath0 abundances .",
    "we obtain c / o=0.55@xmath300.24 for this nebula . for a  46 and a  63",
    ", no orl o@xmath53 abundance determination is available , and therefore the icf can only be estimated using cels which would indicate values very close to unity .",
    "we obtain c / o=0.78@xmath300.11 for a  46 , and 1.66@xmath300.47 for a  63 which is the only nebula where the c / o ratio seems to be above unity .",
    "therefore , in spite of the uncertainty involved in the use of the faint orls , the low c / o ratios estimated in a  46 and ou5 , as well as in hf  22 @xcite , argue against vltps as the origin of the high - metallicity ejecta causing the large observed _ adf_s .",
    "nova outbursts are natural phenomena in interacting binaries",
    ". they result from thermonuclear runaways on the surfaces of white dwarfs ( wds ) accreting hydrogen - rich matter in binary systems ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nova ejecta are metal enriched by mixing between the accreted envelope and the wd core .",
    "therefore , in principle , the metal - rich gas in our target nebulae could be ejected in nova outbursts from the close binary central stars , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite for a  30 and a  58 . in these two cases ,",
    "the hypothesis of a nova eruption could explain the large neon enrichment of their hydrogen - deficient knots , if produced in a massive ( m@xmath541.2  m@xmath8 ) onemg wds .",
    "for a  58 , this scenario ( in combination with a final helium shell flash ) or the alternative possibility of a stellar merger are evaluated in @xcite .    however , there is no indication that mass transfer from the secondaries to the primaries is currently going on in the systems that we have studied , because the secondary stars  albeit inflated  do not fill their roche lobe @xcite . to feed the wd ,",
    "accretion must therefore come from circumbinary material left - over in the systems from the ce phase .",
    "a possibility is that the envelope is not removed completely in the ce interaction and part of it remains gravitationally bounded to the system .",
    "the non - accreted part of this circumstellar gas , with normal agb abundances , could then interact with the nova ejecta and partially mix with it producing the observed dual - component nebulae . in this respect",
    ", it should be noted that the existing simulations of the ce process fail to eject the entire envelope , a large fraction of which remains gravitationally bound to the system @xcite .",
    "this may result in a series of ce and fall - back events , and in the formation of a left over , low mass circumbinary disk ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* kuruwita , de marco & staff , in preparation ) , which could in turn form metal - rich dust as perhaps observed in the putative post - ce system v1309  sco @xcite .",
    "possible problems are the very low mass of classical nova ejecta ( @xmath3310@xmath6  m@xmath8 , but generally much smaller , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the short timescale ( a few years ) of their nuclear burning and high luminosity phase that are needed to light up the pne .",
    "long - lasting outbursts at high wd luminosity can be achieved if the mass accretion rate is higher than in classical novae , as for instance occurs in symbiotic ( very slow ) novae .",
    "the relevant parameters space should be explored in detail to see how this hypothesis can fit our post  ce pne ( cf .",
    "e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "an additional important parameter is the expansion velocity of the ejecta . in the pne that we have studied , the orl emitting gas phase",
    "does not show the large expansion velocities ( few to many hundred km  s@xmath7 ) typical of classical and symbiotic novae , which would be easily revealed at the resolution of our spectra . while more precise information is not available yet",
    ", a further constraint for the modeling is that both the hot and cold gas components have expansion velocities more typical of pne than of novae .",
    "a source of the metal - rich component in the nebulae might be planetary debris that survived the ce phase .",
    "indeed , about a quarter of _ single _ wds have considerable amounts of metals in their photosphere , that are explained by accretion of tidally disrupted planetesimals / asteroids / comets that survived through all previous evolutionary phases of the star ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the possible contribution of solid bodies to the metal - rich component in pne was first mentioned by @xcite and then investigated by @xcite .",
    "they conclude that solid bodies could provide the source of the high - metallicity gas only if they are meter - sized or larger , their evaporation process extends back to the final agb evolution , mixing with the gas component at `` normal '' agb metallicity is inefficient , and systems possess a much more massive population of comets than is found in our solar system .",
    "note also that @xcite and @xcite proposed that photoevaporating protoplanetary disks are the cause of the smaller _",
    "adf_s  found in h  ii  regions .",
    "another possibility is that these post - ce nebulae are produced by the destruction of one or more circumbinary jovian planets .",
    "there is increasing evidence that post - ce planets exist @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that planets in unstable orbits spiral in , are tidally disrupted , and collide with the post - agb star @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen - rich envelope of the planet would be stripped first , and then its metallic core .",
    "part of this material would be accreted by the wd : at high accretion rates , the gas can not be processed and inflates a red - giant envelope , producing a new ce phase and eventually the ejection of a new nebula with the dual nature ( h - rich from the planet envelope and metal - rich from its core ) that we have observed .",
    "the new ce would also favour the formation of highly bipolar nebulae such as ou5 and a  63 , by forcing the ce ejection toward the orbital plane , and/or producing jets from one of the two stars ( as observed in a  63 ) . a possible problem with this hypothesis",
    "is the apparently enhanced helium abundance of our target pne ( table  [ t - totab ] ) , which is not characteristic of planets .",
    "however , the he abundances in these high-_adf _  objects are likely to be overestimated @xcite .",
    "while this scenario should be taken as highly speculative at this stage , it has several positive aspects such as the fact that the process for planet collision is long enough ( @xmath5510@xmath56 year ) to allow the ce to vanish , the ejection could be split into different phases ( the planet s atmosphere and core ) , and the observed nebular masses are in a plausible range corresponding to 1 - 10 jupiter masses . in such case ,",
    "sir william herschel would have been right in coining the name _ planetary _ nebulae !      if our hypothesis of an intimate relation between binarity and large _",
    "adf_s  is correct , we predict that many  if not all  the pne where large _",
    "adf_s  have been measured are post  ce binaries .",
    "one already confirmed case is ngc  6778 which indeed contains a close binary with p@xmath57=0.15 @xcite .",
    "other primary candidates to search for binarity are m  1 - 42 , m  2 - 36 , m  3 - 26 , m  3 - 32 , ngc  6153 and ngc  1501 @xcite , as well as the already mentioned abell 30 and abell 58 .",
    "note that our conclusion does not imply the opposite hypothesis , i.e. that _ all _ post  ce pne have large _ adf_s .",
    "for example , ngc  5189 has a close binary central star @xcite but a low _ adf _  @xcite .",
    "also , no oxygen or carbon recombination lines are detected in relatively deep spectra of the necklace binary pn @xcite .",
    "if some of the post - ce nebulae are not genuine agb envelopes , but rather post - ce mass loss events or post - rgb systems , the total fraction of close binary pn central stars would be smaller than presently estimated ( @xmath315% * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and perhaps more consonant with the fraction of main - sequence binaries ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but also see @xcite ) .    concluding , we have added new ingredients to the discussion of the nature of pne with close binary central stars , the ce evolution , and the abundance discrepancy problem .",
    "the main result of this work is the clear link between binary stellar evolution and the formation of high _",
    "adf_s  in pne .",
    "at the moment , none of the proposed scenarios to explain this result clearly stands out , but this is likely because observations provide still limited constraints . to further progress",
    ", a larger sample of objects should be analyzed to highlight the basic relationships among the numerous parameters involved .",
    "in particular , more precise determinations of crucial quantities such as the nebular masses and chemical compositions for each ( normal and enriched ) nebular components , and the binary parameters ( to better reconstruct the evolution of the systems ) , are needed .    finally , even if the binary nature of the central stars seems to be an essential ingredient to understand the abundance discrepancy problem in pne , it is hard to envisage its relevance to other astrophysical contexts such as h  ii  regions .",
    "this may imply that different causes should be sought to fully understand this long - standing astrophysical problem , as proposed by @xcite . on the other hand , as discussed in the previous sections , some related phenomena may be involved , like for instance the possible contribution of protoplanetary disks in h  ii  regions and of planetary debris in pne .",
    "this work is based on observations obtained with the 4.2 m wht and 2.5 m int telescopes of the isaac newton group of telescopes , operating on the island of la palma at the spanish observatories of the roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias .",
