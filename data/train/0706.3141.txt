    "calculus of variations on time scales ( we refer the reader to section  [ sec:2 ] for a brief introduction to time scales ) has been introduced in 2004 in the papers by bohner @xcite and hilscher and zeidan @xcite , and seems to have many opportunities for application in economics @xcite . in both works of bohner and hilscher&zeidan , the euler - lagrange equation for the fundamental problem of the calculus of variations on time scales , @xmath0=\\int_{a}^{b}l(t , y^\\sigma(t),y^\\delta(t))\\delta t \\longrightarrow\\min , \\quad \\mbox{$y(a)=y_a$ , $ y(b)=y_b$},\\ ] ]",
    "is obtained ( in @xcite for a bigger class of admissible functions and for problems with more general endpoint conditions ) . here",
    "we generalize the previously obtained euler - lagrange equation for variational problems involving delta derivatives of more than the first order , for _ higher - order problems_.    we consider the following extension to problem : @xmath1=\\int_{a}^{\\rho^{r-1}(b ) } l(t , y^{\\sigma^r}(t),y^{\\sigma^{r-1}\\delta}(t),\\ldots , y^{\\sigma\\delta^{r-1}}(t),y^{\\delta^r}(t))\\delta t\\longrightarrow\\min , \\\\",

    "assumptions on the time scale @xmath5 are stated in section  [ sec:2 ] ; the conditions imposed on the lagrangian @xmath6 and on the admissible functions @xmath7 are specified in section  [ secprinci ] . for @xmath8 problem ( [ problema ] )",
    "is reduced to ( [ eq : el : b ] ) ; for @xmath9 we get the classical problem of the calculus of variations with higher - order derivatives .    while in the classical context of the calculus of variations , when @xmath10 , it is trivial to obtain the euler - lagrange necessary optimality condition for problem ( [ problema ] ) as soon as we know how to do it for ( [ eq : el : b ] ) , this is not the case on the time scale setting .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation obtained in @xcite for ( [ eq : el : b ] ) follow the classical proof , substituting the usual integration by parts formula by integration by parts for the delta integral ( lemma  [ integracao partes ] ) . here",
    "we generalize the proof of @xcite to the higher - order case by successively applying the delta - integration by parts and thus obtaining a more general delta - differential euler - lagrange equation .",
    "it is worth to mention that such a generalization poses serious technical difficulties and that the obtained necessary optimality condition is not true on a general time scale , being necessary some restrictions on @xmath5 . proving an euler - lagrange necessary optimality condition for a completely arbitrary time scale @xmath5 is a deep and difficult open question .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec:2 ] a brief introduction to the calculus of time scales is given and some assumptions and basic results provided . then , under the assumed hypotheses on the time scale @xmath5 , we obtain in section  [ secprinci ] the intended higher - order delta - differential euler - lagrange equation .",
