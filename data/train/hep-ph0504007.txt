    "the unusual nature of neutrino mixings as compared to the quark mixings has inspired a large amount of speculation regarding symmetries in the quark - lepton world as well as other kinds of new physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "a particularly intriguing clue is the observation that the leptonic mixing angle @xmath1 and the cabibbo angle @xmath0 ( which provides the quark 1 - 2 mixing ) seem to satisfy a relation , @xmath6    in the context of inverted hierarchy models it was observed some time ago that the predictions for the neutrino mixing angles of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , may receive corrections from the charged lepton mixing angle of order the cabibbo angle , @xmath9 , resulting in the lepton mixing angle @xmath10 being in the lma msw range , with @xmath11 close to its current experimental limit ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however the possibility of a precise relation such as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qlcrelation ] ) was not considered .    while it is quite possible that eq .",
    "( [ eq : qlcrelation ] ) is purely accidental , recent papers @xcite have speculated that this could be a signal of some high scale quark - lepton unification .",
    "indeed the structure of the standard model ( sm ) itself may be said to already provide some indirect hints of such a high scale unification , for example from the universality of weak currents , and the su(2)@xmath12 assignment of fermions .",
    "however the question of how to extend the sm in such a way as to lead to a rather precise qlc relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qlcrelation ] ) is far from clear , and this is the subject of this paper .    the general strategy we shall follow here is to start from an inverted hierarchy structure of the neutrino mass matrix , which predicts @xmath7 , @xmath8 , then look for corrections from the charged lepton sector which can not only give acceptable corrections to the lepton mixing angles as suggested in @xcite , but can accurately give rise to the qlc relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qlcrelation ] ) . in order to achieve this",
    ", it seems necessary to relate the charged lepton mixing angle @xmath13 to the cabibbo angle @xmath0 , and this in turn only seems possible within the framework of a quark - lepton symmetry . as we shall see , it is highly non - trivial to obtain the qlc relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qlcrelation ] ) for several reasons . on the other hand ,",
    "if such a relation is in fact realized , then this potentially tells us a great deal about the detailed structure of the unified theory , as we shall see .",
    "a smoking gun signature of the class of models that we propose here is the additional qlc relation : @xmath14 which enables the approach presented here to be verified or excluded by the present generation of neutrino experiments .    in a recent paper @xcite a model based on the pati - salam gauge group su(2)@xmath15 su(2)@xmath16 su(4)@xmath17 that unifies quarks and leptons @xcite",
    "was proposed in an attempt to realize the qlc relation .",
    "it was pointed out that an inverted hierarchy model based on the @xmath18 symmetry imposed on single bi - doublet pati - salam model could be a good starting point for realizing qlc in a natural gauge theory framework .",
    "it was realized in @xcite that obtaining realistic models for both the quark and lepton sector is highly nontrivial in such models and inevitably leads to nontrivial constraints on the nature of the theory . in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite could lead only to a modified form of qlc ( see discussion below ) as well as the scale of quark lepton unification to be at the multi - tev scale .",
    "furthermore , the relation between the cabibbo angle and the solar mixing angle obey a complementarity relation that is different from that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qlcrelation ] ) ( although it is consistent with observations at 2@xmath19 level ) .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to discuss models for qlc that are more in the spirit of grand unified theories ( guts ) so that quarks and leptons unify at the gut scale of @xmath20 gev .",
    "our strategy will be to construct from the see - saw mechanism a form of neutrino mass matrix consistent with an inverted hierarchy , using the approach of @xcite .",
    "note that in this approach it is possible that the effective neutrino mass matrix has a form which is invariant under @xmath21 without ever imposing this symmetry in the high energy theory .",
    "in fact we shall instead rely on a different @xmath22 family symmetry as playing a leading role in achieving this structure . in order to achieve qlc ,",
    "it is necessary to achieve this within the framework of quark - lepton unification , which we shall assume here to be provided by a high energy pati - salam theory , broken near the unification scale .",
    "the presence of the pati - salam gauge group is necessary to relate the charged lepton mixing angles to the down - quark mixing angles , which in turn dominate the contribution to the cabibbo angle , allowing the qlc relation to emerge , albeit in a non - trivial way .",
    "our approach in this paper is to list explicitly a set of higher dimensional operators in a minimal supersymmetric pati - salam type theory that after symmetry breaking leads to the required form for the mass matrices .",
    "we have not attempted to seek a set of discrete symmetries that would enable us to generate the right set of higher dimensional operators , nor have we addressed the question of the orderings of the index contractions of these operators , since both questions would take us well beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however we have identified a @xmath22 family symmetry which controls the leading operators , which would facilitate the construction of a future theory from the building blocks that we present here .",
    "the purpose of this paper is therefore to present the first elements of a unified model at the gut scale capable of predicting the qlc relation .",
    "this paper has been organized as follows : in sec .  2",
    ", we discuss generic problems with realizing qlc relation in models where the @xmath23 quark - lepton unification scale is close to the gut scale ; in sec .",
    "3 , we review a way of generating inverted hierarchy ( different from that in ref .",
    "@xcite which uses @xmath18 symmetry ) ; in sec .  4 , we present a the set of operators that enables us to realize the inverted hierarchy for neutrinos and eventually , helps us realize the qlc relation . in appendix",
    "a we specify our conventions , and in appendix b we briefly discuss an alternative class of qlc models with a lopsided charged lepton mass matrix .",
    "we shall see that it is not enough to simply postulate a pati - salam symmetry and an inverted hierarchical effective neutrino mass matrix : there are a number of additional hurdles one must clear before the qlc relation will emerge .",
    "the purpose of this section is to outline the main challenges facing qlc .",
    "these challenges can be regarded as a chain of logic , that must remain unbroken at each stage in order to achieve the desired result of qlc .",
    "we shall find that there are non - trivial obstacles facing this approach .",
    "the basic starting point of our approach is to assume that the low energy neutrino mass matrix @xmath24 accurately predicts @xmath25 .",
    "we have already observed that this is possible if the neutrino mass spectrum is inverted , with a majorana parity for @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in the see - saw scenario , @xmath24 is given via the see - saw formula @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the neutrino yukawa matrix , @xmath30 the mass matrix of the right - handed neutrinos and @xmath31 is the vev which leads to masses for the up - type quarks .",
    "we will discuss the construction of see - saw models with inverted hierarchy in sec .",
    "[ sec : inverted ] . for the time being",
    "let us assume that nearly maximal neutrino mixing @xmath32 is generated from @xmath24 , which is then subsequently corrected by charged lepton mixing angles in forming the final leptonic mixing angle @xmath1 .",
    "clearly these corrections coming from the charged lepton sector must have a rather special form , if qlc is to emerge .    in our conventions , which are specified in the appendix ,",
    "the mns matrix is given by @xmath33 .",
    "if we parameterize @xmath34 and @xmath35 in standard parameterization , we obtain ( neglecting the very small mixings @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) : @xmath38 in general , small contributions from the charged lepton mixing angles @xmath39 lead to the following corrections to the mixings from the neutrino sector @xcite :    [ eq : yecontributions ] @xmath40    where we have neglected phases for simplicity .",
    "assuming @xmath41 , we obtain    [ eq : yecontrtexture1 ] @xmath42    we immediately see one problem for realizing qlc : with maximal atmospheric mixing @xmath43 from @xmath24 , shifting the rotation @xmath44 to the right side of @xmath45 induces a factor of @xmath46 for the correction to @xmath1 coming from the charged leptons .",
    "therefore the charged lepton mixing angle @xmath47 needs to be about @xmath48 larger than @xmath49 in order to compensate for this .",
    "note eq .",
    "( [ eq : chargedlcontrtot12_example ] ) implies that the correction to @xmath50 from the charged lepton sector is also equal to @xmath46 times the charged lepton angle @xmath47 .    in our approach",
    "it is necessary that that the cabibbo angle be dominated by the down quark 1 - 2 mixing angle , @xmath51 , with the up - quark 1 - 2 mixing angle @xmath52 being essentially irrelevant .",
    "this is because we shall subsequently use quark - lepton symmetry to relate @xmath47 to @xmath53 .",
    "consider a symmetric texture for the quark yukawa matrices of the form @xmath54 with parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 determined from the quark masses of the second and third generation at the unification scale @xmath57 , @xmath58 it allows to fit the quark data .",
    "constraints from the ckm matrix can be satisfied by taking e.g.@xmath59 the other parameters , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are rather unconstrained .",
    "the texture zero in the ( 1,1)-entry of @xmath62 and @xmath63 leads to the famous gst relation @xcite which connects the quark masses and the cabibbo angle @xmath64 with @xmath65 . for the above parameter",
    "set it is seen to be the case that the cabibbo angle is numerically approximately given from the down quark sector only , @xmath66 which satisfies our necessary condition of qlc .",
    "having argued that it is plausible that @xmath51 , the next link in the chain of logic leading to qlc is to relate the down quark mixing angle @xmath67 to the charged lepton mixing angle @xmath13 .",
    "the well known observation is that the above texture can accommodate the charged lepton data as well , if a clebsch factor ( georgi - jarlskog factor @xcite ) of -3 in the ( 2,2)-entry of @xmath63 is introduced .",
    "the yukawa matrix @xmath68 leads to correct mass ratios for the charged leptons at low energy .",
    "similar textures have been discussed intensively in the literature and have been used for the construction of successful fermion mass models in the framework of unified theories . here",
    "we see an obstacle for qlc with a charged lepton yukawa matrix @xmath39 similar to the one given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : yetextureexample ] ) : because of the georgi - jarlskog factor of -3 in the ( 2,2)-entry of @xmath39 , @xmath47 is not equal to the cabibbo angle , but appears to be three times smaller .",
    "recall that in order to achieve qlc , we would require @xmath47 to be @xmath48 larger than the cabibbo angle , whereas we have just found it to be three times smaller !",
    "putting these arguments together we find @xmath69 which with eq .",
    "( [ eq : yecontrtexture1_t12_example ] ) gives a total correction of @xmath70 in total , the deviation of the lepton mixing @xmath1 from maximal is only @xmath71 .",
    "these , then , are the challenges that must be overcome , if we are to achieve qlc .",
    "in fact it is possible to overcome these challenges , and we will see in sec .  [",
    "sec : models ] how these problems can be solved and how a qlc relation @xmath72 can be realized within the framework of quark - lepton - unified models .",
    "the lesson , however , is that the qlc relation is non - trivial to achieve , and if it is realized in nature , and is not accidental , then we potentially stand to learn a great deal about the structure of the underlying unified theory .",
    "as noted in @xcite , a good starting point towards obtaining qlc is a majorana mass matrix for neutrinos that leads to inverted hierarchy for neutrinos as well as maximal solar mixing angle .",
    "the mass matrix ought to have the form : @xmath73 one way to get this form for the mass matrix is to have an @xmath21 symmetry @xcite .",
    "one may however start with a more general mass matrix , following a procedure introduced in @xcite , which we now briefly review .",
    "it has been shown that naturalness suggests a pseudo - dirac structure of the mass matrix @xmath74 of the right - handed neutrinos .. ] we begin by writing @xmath74 and the neutrino dirac mass matrix @xmath75 as @xmath76 we then impose the condition that the pseudo - dirac right - handed neutrino pair dominates in the see - saw mechanism @xcite : @xmath77 in @xcite it was shown that one of the two possibilities @xmath78 then leads to a natural class of inverted hierarchy models . for the example @xmath79 , leads to an inverted hierarchy with mixing angles , @xmath80 ( and analogous , with primed quantities interchanged with non - primed ones , for @xmath81 ) .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath82 for instance , @xmath74 and @xmath83 of the approximate forms @xmath84 would lead to the neutrino mass matrix of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mllinverted ] ) .",
    "of course , small perturbations have to be added in both cases in order to generate the required small solar mass splitting @xcite .",
    "note that , although the resulting effective neutrino mass matrix respects the symmetry @xmath21 , it is not necessary to assume this symmetry in the construction of this matrix . in the framework of pati - salam models , we will give a possible choice of u(1)-charges which lead to mass matrices similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : invhierarchyexample ] ) .",
    "we will assume that the symmetry group of our theory contains the pati - salam gauge group @xmath85 , plus an additional flavour symmetry group @xmath86 , which we shall only partly specify , but which contains a family symmetry @xmath87 .",
