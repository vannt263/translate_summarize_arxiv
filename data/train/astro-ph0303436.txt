    "the dusty center of our galaxy harbors a compact massive object , most likely a black hole ( genzel et .",
    "1997 , ghez et .",
    "al .  1998 ) .",
    "the galactic center is also host to a numerous population of young stars ( see genzel et .",
    "al .  2000 , hereafter g00 , and references therein ) .",
    "such a combination is a puzzle as the tidal field of should suppress star formation in its vicinity ( phinney 1989 ) .",
    "interestingly , g00 have found that most young stars move clockwise on the sky around the putative black hole .    in this letter",
    "we analyze and interpret the three - dimensional ( 3d ) velocity data of g00 . in the next section ,",
    "we show the available sample of 13 stars and find that 10 of them revolve in a thin disk .",
    "we discuss this result in   3 and propose that a burst of star formation occurred recently within a dense gaseous disk . in   4 , we consider the orbit of s2 , the young star closest to ( schdel et al .",
    "2002 ; ghez et al .",
    "its orbital plane is inclined by @xmath6 to the stellar disk .",
    "we show that the orbital plane of s2 is turning around the black - hole spin axis due to the lense - thirring precession , and thus it is possible that s2 was born in the plane of the stellar disk . within this hypothesis ,",
    "we are able to constrain the magnitude of the black - hole spin .",
    "for 13 young stars with strong he - emission lines , g00 were able to measure 3d velocities .",
    "eleven of them were found to move clockwise on the sky .",
    "we find that 10 velocity vectors of the clockwise - moving stars from this sample lie in one plane within the measurement errors .",
    "figure  1 shows the full available sample of 13 vectors in two projections : ( a ) as viewed by an observer on earth and ( b ) as viewed by an observer located in the found plane .",
    "one can see that ten vectors lie in the plane within at most @xmath7 .",
    "the sample is clearly inconsistent with a stellar population of randomly oriented orbits .",
    "indeed , what would be the probability to have 10 out of 13 random vectors clustering so tightly near a single plane ?",
    "a monte - carlo simulation demonstrates that this probability is @xmath8 . if we limit our sample to stars 111 that move clockwise on the sky , then @xmath9 .",
    "the pattern of velocities observed in figure  1b suggests that the stars are divided into two groups .",
    "( 1 ) stars 110 with nearly co - planar velocities belong to a thin disk ; note that they all move clockwise on the sky .",
    "( 2 ) stars 1113 with velocities far from the disk plane ( @xmath10 ) ; they have a random sense of rotation on the sky ( stars 12 and 13 move counter - clockwise ) .",
    "we fitted vectors 110 by one plane using the @xmath11 test .",
    "the reduced @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of stars , @xmath14 is a unit vector normal to the plane , @xmath15 is the velocity vector of the @xmath16th star , and @xmath17 are the measurement errors of the components of @xmath15 .",
    "the best fit has the reduced @xmath18 .",
    "if we added the 11th star then @xmath11 would jump to 3.2 .",
    "unit vector @xmath19 normal to the best - fit plane is @xmath20 in conventional galactic coordinates : @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the coordinates on the sky ( right ascension and declination , respectively ) and @xmath23 axis is directed along the line of sight away from us .",
    "the @xmath11 test also shows that the uncertainty in @xmath19 is small : @xmath11 increases by a factor of two if one rocks @xmath24 through @xmath25 .",
    "although the data is consistent with stars 110 having orbits exactly in the best - fit plane , the measurement errors allow modest orbital inclinations relative to this plane , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , i.e. the stellar disk can have a modest openning angle .",
    "we now evaluate the upper limit on this angle .",
    "suppose the ten stars are drawn from a rotating stellar system with orbital planes pivoting around the best - fit plane with a dispersion @xmath28 . to check the consistency of a given @xmath28 with the data we use the monte - carlo technique .",
    "we simulate a random realization of ten orbital planes @xmath27 drawn from the model population , and choose in each plane a vector @xmath15 with the absolute value equal to the corresponding real @xmath29 and a random direction on the generated vectors .",
    "their mean deviations @xmath30 are taken equal to those of the real measurements of g00 . ] . then , using equation  ( 1 ) , we fit @xmath15 by one plane . with many realizations of the artificial sample",
    ", we find the probability that @xmath31 .",
    "in other words , we find the probability that the artificial sample allows as good co - planar fit as the one we found for the real data .",
    "this probability @xmath32 is a measure of the data consistency with assumed @xmath28 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  2 .",
    "we find @xmath8 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the half - opening angle of the stellar disk does not exceed @xmath36 .",
    "the existence of the young stellar disk provides a new insight into the puzzle of star formation in the galactic center .",
    "normal star formation via fragmentation of a molecular cloud is impossible there , since the cloud would be ripped apart by the tidal forces it would encounter so close to the black hole ( phinney 1989 ) .",
    "one solution to this problem was proposed by gerhard ( 2001 ) . in his picture ,",
    "a stellar cluster was born @xmath37  pc away from , and then spiraled in due to gravitational interaction with ambient stars . as it spiraled in ,",
    "the cluster was stripped and finally its core was disrupted by the tidal field of .",
    "the young stars left from the disintegrated cluster would continue to move in orbital planes close to that of the parent cluster , within an angle @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is mass of the cluster core and @xmath40 is the black - hole mass .",
    "this is consistent with the observed thickness of the stellar disk if @xmath41 , which also agrees with gerhard s estimate for @xmath39 .",
    "however , this scenario has a problem : the cluster should be disrupted relatively far from , at about 0.4  pc ( gerhard 2001 ) .",
    "in contrast , many of the young stars are located within 0.1  pc , thus their origin remains unexplained .",
    "we propose that the stars were born in a dense gaseous disk that existed around in the past .",
    "such a disk can form when an infalling molecular cloud is tidally disrupted by the central black hole . alternatively ,",
    "the disk can grow gradually by accumulating gas from the ambient medium . in either case , the disk orientation is determined by the gas angular momentum .",
    "accumulation of gas in one plane leads to a significant increase of its density .",
    "when the density exceeds @xmath42 at a radius @xmath43 , the disk become unstable with respect to its own gravity , and its fragments collapse ( paczynski 1978 )",
    ". the clumping instability can lead to formation of stars , and this process is believed to occur in active nuclei of other galaxies ( kolykhalov and sunyaev 1980 , shlosman and begelman 1987 , collin and zahn 1999 ) .",
    "detailed models of self - gravitating disks show that the fragmentation takes place at radii @xmath44 ( goodman 2003 ) , which is consistent with the proximity of the young stellar population to sgr  a@xmath45",
    ". the dense accretion disk can also trap old stars from initially inclined orbits ( artymowicz , lin , and wampler 1993 ) .",
    "the trapped stars would then accrete the disk material and grow to large masses , so that now they would appear as young stars .",
    "no dense gaseous disk is currently observed around , which implies that it is a transient phenomenon .",
    "after the onset of the clumping instability and the burst of star formation , the disk can be drained quickly : partly it is blown away by the stellar winds and partly it is accreted onto the central black hole .",
    "a major remnant of the past activity near are the young stars .",
    "the estimated ages of stars indicate that the burst of accretion took place @xmath46 millions of years ago .",
    "the stellar disk is immersed in the ambient spherical cluster of old stars , and is being stirred by their gravitational fields . with time , the disk will get thicker and , in approximately @xmath47 million years , it will become indistinguishable from the spherical cluster ( see g00 for the estimate of the cluster relaxation time ) .",
    "the present age of the young stars is significantly smaller and the disk can be well preserved .",
    "the fact that a fraction of the young stars do not belong to the disk remains to be explained .",
    "in particular , 3 stars with measured 3d velocities are out of the disk plane , and 2 of them are on counter - rotating orbits .",
    "the available sample used in our work does not include a comparable number of stars that are even closer to but whose 3d velocities remain unmeasured . in the accretion - disk scenario , they could have migrated inward as a result of tidal interaction with the dense disk ( ward 1986 , gould and rix 2000 ) .",
    "the lack of 3d velocity measurements of close stars does not allow us to check whether their orbits are in the disk plane .",
    "recently , it became possible to map out the 3-dimensional orbit of star @xmath48 , which is closest to the black hole ( schdel et .",
    "2002 , ghez et .",
    "al .  2003 ) .",
    "its sense of orbital rotation is similar to that of the stellar disk , however , the orbital plane is different .",
    "there is no inconsistency here : s2 is so close to that the black - hole spin can make the orbital plane of s2 turn slowly around the spin axis .",
    "this is a general - relativistic effect known as lense - thirring precession ( misner , thorne , and wheeler 1973 ) . using the measured orbit eccentricity @xmath49 and semimajor axis @xmath50  pc , we find the period of precession , @xmath51 where @xmath3 is the dimesionless spin of the black hole , with @xmath52 corresponding to a maximal spin .",
    "thus , even though s2 orbit is not presently in the plane of the stellar disk , it could have been there a few million years ago .",
    "the current angle between the disk and s2 orbital plane is about @xmath6 , and the disk origin of s2 would require @xmath53 where @xmath5 is the age of @xmath48 .",
    "once the orbits of other close stars are mapped out , the hypothesis that they were born in the stellar disk and later precessed out of the disk plane can be tested .",
    "just one additional orbit will be sufficient to determine the direction of the black - hole spin , and two additional orbits would allow one to confirm or rule out the precession hypothesis .",
    "we are grateful to reinhard genzel for the update on the stellar velocities , and to norm murray , marten van kerkwijk , and chris matzner for discussions .",
    "we thank sarah levin for her advise on the prose .",
