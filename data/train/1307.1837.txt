    "several different acceleration mechanisms may operate in the outflow regions as a result of the explosive energy release by reconnection , involving either the kinetic effects of small amplitude electromagnetic fluctuations or the spatial - temporal variations of the large scale magnetic fields . among these mechanisms , the model of stochastic acceleration ( sa ) , also known as the second - order fermi process @xcite , has achieved considerable success in interpreting the high energy features of solar flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the shape of the accelerated electron spectrum is a result of the interplay between the competing processes involved in the leaky box fokker - planck equation ( [ eq : fpeq ] ) .",
    "conversely , we can gain some insight into these physical processes from the electron spectra as we have shown above .",
    "both @xmath67 and @xmath23 primarily depend on the ratio @xmath87 . by eliminating @xmath87 from equations ( [ eq : tesc2 ] and [ eq : dee2 ] ) , we relate the timescales for the physical processes as below , @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 . if the ( non - relativistic ) x - ray radiating electron spectra @xmath65 and @xmath63 in solar flares are nearly power laws , then both @xmath91 and @xmath92 vary very slowly with energy .",

    "as mentioned above , @xcite first inverted the electron flux visibility spectrum from the count visibility spectrum .",

    "@xmath126 if we also assume the sa model ( assumption ii ) , in which @xmath23 and @xmath22 are related by equation ( [ eq : aede ] ) , then we find that _ the energy diffusion time increases with energy _ and is roughly parallel to the escape time for both flares ( except in the few low energy bins ) . the same is true for the direct acceleration time .",
    "this behavior is what is expected when the fp sources are stronger than the lt source ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "clearly knowledge thus gained from observations can then be used to directly compare with theoretical model predictions .",
    "it should , however , be emphasized that the derivation of the electron escape time does not involve assumptions about any specific acceleration mechanisms and thus it may impose the most severe constraint on the theoretical models .",
    "we now discuss whether the above results , specifically the discordant energy dependences of the acceleration and scattering time , can be reconciled with the predictions of the sa model .",
    "this is a test of the above assumption ii while keeping assumption i.    as described in the quasilinear theory , the momentum and pitch angle diffusion coefficients are related to the turbulence energy density spectrum @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the wave number , plasma dispersion relation @xmath130 , and resonance conditions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : pp97times ] , there is a considerable variation of the model timescales at low energies , especially for the energy diffusion ( or direct acceleration ) time .",
    "the scattering time from the models increases or is nearly constant with energy at the non - relativistic regime .",
    "it generally obeys an approximate relation , @xmath133 @xcite , so that a steep turbulence spectrum with @xmath134 is needed for a scattering time that decreases with energy .",
    "thus , for the two flares studied above , we need @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively .",
    "however , for such steep turbulence spectra , the diffusion and acceleration timescales will most likely decrease with energy .",
    "@xcite provided another approximate expression , @xmath137 , which is valid in a limited non - relativistic range .",
    "this would disagree with our results under the random walk approximation .",

    "we therefore conclude that the observational results from the intense x3.9 class flare on 2003",
    "november 3 is not consistent with the sa model predictions as presented above .",
    "while the results from the weaker m2.1 class flare on 2005 september 8 with weaker and softer lt emission have less severe disagreement with the sa model if electrons are interacting with a steep portion of the turbulence spectrum , possibly in the damping range beyond the inertial range ) in the damping range has been adopted by @xcite to explain the spectral hardening of hxr spectra above 300 kev in solar flares involving a termination shock . ]",
    "however , a steep turbulence spectrum will require more energy in the turbulence unless its spectral range of the steep part is narrow .",
    "obliquely propagating waves will have different energy dependences for these timescales , but limited information on perpendicularly propagating waves seems to give similar energy dependences for the momentum and pitch angle diffusion timescales @xcite .",
    "we should emphasize that the two intense events on 2003 november 3 and 2005",
    "september 8 are not representative of typical flares .",
    "as mentioned above , the escape time and energy diffusion time are primarily determined by the ratio @xmath87 .",
    "the discrepancy between the above observational results and the sa model predictions is related to the relatively bright lt source with a flat spectrum . on the contrary",
    ", imaging spectroscopic observations have indicated that for most flares , the lt source is much weaker and has a steeper spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , spectral studies of the over - the - limb solar flares with their fp sources occulted from _",
    "@xcite and from _ rhessi _ @xcite found that their spectral index on average is larger than that from the disk flares by 1.5 and 2 , respectively .",
    "thus , for those more common flare events , we can expect flatter energy dependences for the escape time , energy diffusion time , and scattering time as determined from observations , which would be closer to the sa model predictions .",
    "addition of acceleration by a shock does not seem to help in this regard .",
    "if a standing shock exists at the acceleration region with a high speed @xmath145 , it may dominate the acceleration rate , @xmath146 with an acceleration time @xmath147 @xcite .",
    "if the escape of particles is again diffusive in nature ( @xmath148 , then we expect a simple inverse relation between the escape time and shock acceleration time , @xmath149 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if shock acceleration is dominant , then from integration of the fokker - planck equation ( with @xmath150 ) , we obtain @xmath151 therefore the acceleration rate by a shock , which now depends only on the pitch angle diffusion rate , is similar to the energy diffusion coefficient derived above ( equation [ eq : dee ] ) .",
    "we can then express the shock acceleration timescale in terms of observables as @xmath152 .",
    "for the case @xmath153 , our observations indicate that roughly @xmath154 ( equation [ eq : timescales ] ) , which is in direct disagreement with the above inverse relation expected from the shock acceleration model .",
    "thus for both sa and shock acceleration , we encounter contradiction with the above assumption i that the long escape time is due to the random walk approximation expected in the strong diffusion limit ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "alternatively , a long escape time may arise in a magnetic mirror geometry as we discuss next ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "assumption i involves the use of equation ( [ eq : tesc ] ) , which in the strong diffusion limit gives the random walk relation , but in the weak diffusion limit ( @xmath156 ) gives @xmath157 .",
    "however , in addition to plasma waves or turbulence , magnetic reconnection may restructure the the large scale magnetic fields into a configuration that can also trap and accelerate particles in the lt region ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the newly reconnected , cusp - shaped magnetic field lines relax and shrink to the underlying closed loops and may form a magnetic mirror geometry in the corona .",
    "a cusp - shaped geometry is often seen from soft x - ray and euv images and coronal hxr sources in many events have been found to be located near such a structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the magnetic field lines converge from the center of the lt acceleration region to where the particles escape into the loop legs , then the escape time will be affected . in the strong diffusion limit",
    "we would still expect a random walk process . while in the weak diffusion limit , instead of @xmath157",
    ", we expect an escape time @xmath158 , which is the time needed to scatter particles into the loss cone @xcite .",
    "the proportionality constant depends on several factors but primarily on the pitch angle distribution and the mirroring ratio @xmath159 , the ratio of the magnetic field intensity from the boundary to the center of the acceleration region .",
    "as well known from the conservation of the magnetic moment ( the first adiabatic invariant ) , only particles with a pitch angle smaller than the mirroring angle , or a pitch angle cosine @xmath160 , can escape from this magnetic trap and penetrate to the loop fps . in absence of scattering",
    ", the rest of the particles will be trapped in the mirror .",
    "but when there is scattering , the particles with high pitch angles will be scattered into the loss cone , perhaps after several bounces back and forth between the mirroring points . for example , for an isotropic pitch angle distribution , we can obtain an average escape time as @xmath161 which for strong convergence @xmath162 ) would give @xmath163 .",
    "@xcite showed that for electrons injected into the trap with @xmath164 , one has a proportionality constant of @xmath165 .",
    "for strong convergence , they also identified an intermediate range @xmath166 , where @xmath167 .    in summary , in a converging field geometry , we expect the escape time first decreases with an increasing scattering time , but instead of becoming equal to the crossing time , it then reaches a minimum and begins to increase linearly with the scattering time when the latter exceeds the crossing time .",
    "thus , a long escape time can arise not only from a short scattering time in the strong diffusion scenario , but also from a long scattering time in a converging magnetic field configuration",
    ". some earliest mechanisms that were proposed to produce a distinct coronal hxr source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) basically adopted the second scenario with coulomb collisions as the scattering agent for the suprathermal electrons .",
    "in addition , an observed escape time that increases with energy requires a scattering time that also increases with energy . for scattering due to coulomb collisions in a fully ionized hydrogen plasma in the non - relativistic limit , the electron pitch angle scattering time follows @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "therefore , if coulomb scattering is the agent that scatters electrons into the loss cone and cause their escape , the escape time will be comparable to the energy loss time and scales with energy as @xmath169 .",
    "this is in disagreement with the above observational results from both events .",
    "even if the scattering time is comparable to the crossing time , then we would be in the intermediate regime and the escape time would vary like the crossing time as @xmath170 , which also disagrees with observations .",
    "on the other hand , if scattering is dominated by wave - particle interactions , then because the above observations gives roughly similar energy dependences for the energy diffusion time and escape time , this would mean similar dependences for the scattering time and energy diffusion time .",
    "this would be in better agreement with theoretical expectations in the sa model by turbulence .",
    "but for the shock acceleration model , our observations imply a relation @xmath171 , and in a converging field configuration , we expect @xmath172 . while the shock acceleration model predicts @xmath173 ( section [ sec : shock ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that this very first non - parametric determination of the sa model characteristics directly from the observed data could be reconciled with stochastic acceleration by turbulence , if the lt acceleration region is surrounded by a cusp - shaped magnetic geometry with a relatively large mirroring ratio . on the other hand",
    ", our results do not seem to be consistent with what is expected in acceleration in a standing shock at the lt region of the flare , regardless of whether there is strong field convergence .",
    "the exact treatment of the acceleration and transport of electrons in a more realistic geometry can not be treated by the leaky box model and requires inclusion of the kinematic effects of a magnetic mirror in a dynamic flare environment that is more complicated and will be treated in future works .",
