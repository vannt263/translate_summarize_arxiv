    "the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) in low - dimensional structures attracts a great deal of interest since it opens up the possibility to manipulate the electron spin in nonmagnetic structures using electrical means .",
    "@xcite in this view , semiconductor heterostructures with 2d electrons are very promising since the rashba soi is effectively controlled  @xcite by varying applied bias or gate voltages .",
    "in recent years , predominant interest was paid to effects appearing when the soi modifies propagating electron modes with energy above the conduction band bottom .",
    "suffice it to mention the spin - hall effect ,  @xcite or spin manipulation in strained semiconductors  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that interesting effects of the soi arise also when the electron energy is lower than or near to the conduction band bottom and evanescent states are involved .",
    "these states determine electron tunneling .",
    "they are important in 2d structures with laterally inhomogeneous potential landscape .",
    "we find that such structures can effectively polarize the transmitted electron current .",
    "3d tunnel structures , in which spin polarization arises due to the soi , were considered in a number of recent works .",
    "zakharova et al  @xcite studied the interband tunneling , voskoboynikov et al  @xcite considered a tunnel structures with the rashba soi at the interfaces . in these cases",
    "the electron flow acquires a spin polarization if the structure is asymmetric . in symmetric tunnel structures",
    "the spin polarization arises , if the barrier material is noncentrosymmetrical .",
    "@xcite the polarization mechanism , proposed by perel et al  @xcite , consists in a spin - dependent renormalization of the electron effective mass owing to the dresselhaus soi in the barrier .",
    "however , all these structures have a common property restricting their capability to generate spin polarization .",
    "the polarization is absent if the electron current is perpendicular to the barrier .",
    "in other words , for the spin polarization to appear the momentum distribution function of incident electrons must be asymmetric with respect to the momentum component parallel to the barrier .",
    "the effective mass renormalization occurs if the hamiltonian of the soi is quadratic in longitudinal momentum .",
    "however , the dispersion relation of electrons in the presence of the soi is generally much more complicated and therefore a more careful analysis of the complex band structure and evanescent states should be carried out to study the spin - dependent tunneling . in the 3d case ,",
    "such calculations were recently carried out for some specific materials and qualitatively new features were found .",
    "@xcite    2d tunnel structures are scantily studied to date . in particular ,",
    "as far as we know , even the complex band structure of 2d electrons was not explored .",
    "though the presence of evanescent states is obvious , only a few of works touched upon these modes .",
    "usaj , reynoso and balseiro  @xcite attracted evanescent states to study the electron scattering at the edges of 2d samples , but the total spectrum of evanescent states was not considered .",
    "the importance of evanescent modes in quasi - one - dimensional systems in the presence of the soi was pointed out in a number of works .",
    "@xcite    khodas , shekter , and finkelstein  @xcite studied the electron beam propagation in 2d electron gas with spatially inhomogeneous soi .",
    "they considered the transmission through a strip , in which the soi strength differs from that in the rest of the 2d electron gas , to show that an initially unpolarized beam splits into two beams with different spin polarizations propagating in different directions .",
    "the consideration was restricted by propagating states since only the case of uniform potential landscape was studied .",
    "spin - dependent reflection of electrons from a lateral barrier in 2d system was observed in insb / inalsb heterostuctures  @xcite and described theoretically in ref .  .",
    "silvestrov and mishchenko  @xcite demonstrated the possibility to achieve spin - polarized currents in a 2d system with smooth potential barrier and spatially - uniform soi by considering propagating modes within semiclassical approach .    in this paper",
    "we show that strong polarization effect appears in 2d structures when electrons pass through a lateral potential barrier , in which the soi is stronger than in the outside 2d electron gas regions ( reservoirs ) .",
    "the polarization arises even if the electric current is normal to the barrier .",
    "the highest polarization is attained when the electron energy is close to the conduction band bottom in the barrier . in this case",
    "the fact becomes important that the soi effectively splits the barrier height so that some part of electrons passes through the barrier via propagating states while others do this via the evanescent modes .",
    "since the spin and orbital degrees of freedom are coupled , rather strong spin filtering occurs .",
    "we study the total spectrum of electron states in 2d bounded system with soi to find that there are two type of evanescent states .",
    "the first - type states are characterized by an imaginary longitudinal wavevector .",
    "they fill in a gap in the propagating state spectrum .",
    "the states of the second type lie in the forbidden gap .",
    "they are described by a complex wavevector .",
    "the electron tunneling through a lateral barrier with soi via these evanescent states exhibits unusual features , such as an oscillatory behavior of the transmission coefficient with the barrier width .",
    "but of most interest is the spin polarization of the electron current .",
    "the polarization efficiency is high enough even if the distribution function of incident electrons is symmetric with respect to the transverse momentum .",
    "we explore the polarization efficiency in a wide range of electron energy to find that most effective spin filtering occurs if the fermi energy is close to the barrier height .",

    "all the above results are generalized to the case of dresselhaus soi . for a 2d system oriented along [ 001 ]",
    "crystallographic direction , the soi hamiltonian is  @xcite @xmath179 it is well known that dresselhaus and rashba hamiltonians are unitary equivalent .",
    "@xcite an unitary matrix @xmath180 transforms the rashba hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltr ] ) to the dresselhaus one : @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , the dresselhaus soi case does not require separate calculations .",
    "it is enough to carry out this transformation .",
    "taking into account that matrix ( [ r - d_matrix ] ) transforms the spin matrices as follows : @xmath182 , @xmath183 , and @xmath184 , we arrive at the conclusions : ( i ) the dispersion equation is the same as in the rashba case  ( [ zeta ] ) ;    \\(ii ) the spin functions differ from those defined by eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) by a simple substitution @xmath185 ;    \\(iii ) the spin components of transmitted electrons in the incident states @xmath103 and @xmath104 differ from those of sec.[tunneling ] by replacements : @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 ;    \\(iv ) the spin polarization of the current transmitted through a barrier with soi has only @xmath17 component , if the distribution function is even with respect to the transverse momentum .",
    "in particular , figs  [ polar - d_3 ] , [ polar - e ] are valid for the spin polarization normal to the barrier , @xmath189 .",
    "of course , if the rashba and dresselhaus mechanisms act simultaneously the results change qualitatively .",
    "we have found the total spectrum of electron states in a bounded 2d electron gas with soi .",
    "it addition to well known propagating states it contains two branches of evanescent states .",
    "their wavefunctions decay with the distance in the direction @xmath17 perpendicular to the boundary . one branch ( `` purely decaying '' evanescent mode ) is described by an imaginary wavevector .",
    "the energy of this state is splitted by spin , so that there are two subbranches .",
    "they fill in the gap , which opens in the propagating state spectrum at @xmath190 .",
    "other branch ( `` oscillating '' evanescent mode ) is characterized by a complex wavevector @xmath77 .",
    "these states lie in the forbidden gap .",
    "we have studied the electron transmission through a lateral potential barrier with the soi . in the energy range , where electrons tunnel via the oscillating evanescent states",
    ", the tunneling reveals unusual features , such as an oscillatory dependence of the transmission coefficients on the barrier width and the energy .",
    "but of most importance is the spin polarization of the electron current .",
    "the value and direction of the polarization depend on the angle of incidence and the energy of incident electrons .",
    "the polarization appears even if the distribution function of incident electrons is symmetric with respect to the transverse momentum . in this case",
    "the polarization is directed parallel to the barrier ( in the rashba soi case ) or perpendicular to it ( for dresselhaus soi ) .",
    "the highest efficiency of the spin polarization is attained when the fermi energy is close to the barrier height . in this case , electrons pass through the barrier partially via the propagating states and partially via the purely decaying evanescent states . under this condition",
    "the most effective spin filtering occurs .",
    "the maximal polarization efficiency depends on the barrier height and can exceed 0.5 if the barrier width is on the order of @xmath143 .",
