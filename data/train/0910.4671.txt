    "cro@xmath0 is one of only a few known ferromagnetic oxides , and is the only material which has been experimentally shown to be a ferromagnetic `` half - metal''@xcite .",
    "a half - metal is a material which is a metal for one spin channel and an insulator for the other .",
    "cro@xmath0 crystallizes in the rutile crystal structure ( figure  [ rutile ] ) , as do tio@xmath0 , vo@xmath0 , mno@xmath0 , ruo@xmath0 , and sno@xmath0 .",
    "the existence of isostructural oxides with a variety of different electronic and magnetic properties makes the rutile system interesting for theoretical investigations of spintronics because one can envisage the growth of layered devices with the same crystal structure throughout .",
    "since cro@xmath0 offers such special opportunities for understanding oxide spintronics , it is important to establish how well our standard electronic structure tools work in dealing with the electronic and magnetic structure of this material .",
    "it is well known that they encounter difficulties in dealing with many transition metal oxides , including the very similar oxide vo@xmath0 , which dft also predicts to be a half - metal at 0k , @xcite but is observed to be an insulator .",
    "an additional motiviation for understanding exchange interactions in cro@xmath0 is the fact that its curie temperature ( @xmath2 k)@xcite is sufficiently close to room temperature that its magnetic properties are significantly degraded at room temperature , hindering potential spintronics applications . a better understanding may point the way to improvement .",
    "the electronic structure and density of states were calculated using density functional theory@xcite ( dft ) .",
    "our calculated density of states is similar to previous calculations.@xcite the electronic structure of cro@xmath0 can be understood by comparing the dos of cro@xmath0 with that of tio@xmath0 .",
    "rutile tio@xmath0 is a non - magnetic insulator . in the rutile structure , as in many transition metal oxides , each transition metal atom is surrounded by six oxygen nearest - neighbors .",
    "each oxygen atom has three transition metal ( tm ) nearest neighbors .",
    "the tm ions form a body - centered tetragonal lattice , with a @xmath3 ratio of approximately @xmath4 .",
    "the oxygen ions form rows collinear with the cr ions .",
    "the rows containing the body - center cr ions can be considered to run in the ( 110 ) direction , in which case the rows containing the corner cr ions run in the ( 1@xmath50 ) direction .",
    "in addition to the lattice constants ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , a single internal parameter is sufficient to describe the structure . this parameter may be taken to be the distance in the @xmath8-@xmath9 plane between a cr ion and its neighboring oxygen ions .",
    "the oxygen atoms in the top and bottom faces of the tetragonal cell form a rectangle with a cr ion at the center .",
    "the @xmath3 ratio and the internal parameter usually conspire such that the environment of each cr ion is an approximate octahedron of oxygen ions . however , the octahedron is distorted because the square base of the octahedron with the cr ion at its center is actualy a rectangle .",
    "in addition , the distance from a cr ion to the oxygen ions at the apices of the octahedron may differ from the distance to the four equatorial oxygen ions that form the rectangular base . as shown in figure  [ rutile ] , the edges of distorted octahedra form `` ribbons '' along the ( 001 ) direction .",
    "it is straightforward to show that if we treat this system in a tight - binding approximation in which the tm atoms only interact directly with the oxygen atoms ( i.  e.  hopping matrix elements only connect nearest neighbors ) , there will be an energy gap separating the oxygen @xmath10-states and the tm @xmath11-states .",
    "the gap extends from the o-@xmath10 onsite energy to the o-@xmath11 onsite energy .",
    "this gap is apparent in tio@xmath0 , for which the oxygen @xmath10-states are filled and the ti @xmath11-states are empty ( fig .",
    "[ dostio2 ] ) .",
    "when an energy gap occurs at the fermi energy , it contributes significantly to reducing the energy of the structure , because all occupied states are pushed down in energy , while all unoccupied states are pushed up . in cro@xmath0 ,",
    "there are two additional electrons per tm atom compared to tio@xmath0 , so some of the @xmath11-states above the gap must be occupied .    , we use @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( experimental parameters ) . ]    ]    let us consider three possibilities for the occupation of the @xmath11-states in cro@xmath0 .",
    "the first possibility is that the system remains non - magnetic , similar to tio@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ dosnmcro2 ] ) . in this case",
    "each cr atom will have one spin - up and one spin - down @xmath11-electron . from fig .",
    "[ dosnmcro2 ] we can see that there remains a gap between the o-@xmath10 states and the cr-@xmath11 states , but it is significantly smaller than for tio@xmath0 .",
    "if the interactions are strictly nearest neighbor connecting only o ions with ti or cr ions , then the o-@xmath10 on - site energy in a tight - binding model would be at the top of the o-@xmath10 states and the transiton metal @xmath11 on - site energy would be at the bottom of the @xmath11-states .",
    "it should be understood that both states below the gap and the states above the gap are hybrids of o-@xmath10 and tm-@xmath11 .",
    "however , the lower set of states are predominantly o-@xmath10 , and there are 3 of them per spin channel per o ion , and the higher lying states are predominantly tm-@xmath11 , and there are 5 of them per spin channel per tm ion .    . ]",
    "a second possibility is that the system becomes ferromagnetic , the experimentally - observed ground state . in this case",
    "there will be @xmath14 majority spin electrons and @xmath15 minority spin electrons ( fig .",
    "[ dosferrocro2 ] ) . in this spin configuration ,",
    "energy is gained from the intra - atomic `` hund s first rule '' energy , which in most versions of dft is primarily a potential proportional to the local magnetization .",
    "additional energy can be saved if @xmath16 , because this restores the gap for the minority spin channel .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ dosferrocro2 ] that the system chooses @xmath16 for the ferromagnetic case .",
    "the system does this by lowering the on - site energy of the majority of cr @xmath11-states and raising the on - site energy of the minority cr @xmath11-states .",
    "if we were confident that there were only nearest neighbor interactions , the majority density of states would imply that the cr majority @xmath11 on - site energy was essentially degenerate with the o-@xmath10 on - site energy .",
    "in reality , there are next - nearest - neighbor interactions that spread the o-@xmath10 states above the o-@xmath10 on - site energy and spread the cr-@xmath11 states below the cr-@xmath11 onsite energy .    . ]",
    "a third possibility is to maintain two electrons of the same spin on each cr atom , but to make the system antiferromagnetic  for example , by having opposing moments on the corner and body - centered tm atoms of the 6-atom primitive cell ( fig .",
    "[ dosafcro2 ] ) . in this case , the spin - dependent dos of the corner and body - center cr ions are mirror images of each other . assuming that the corner cr ion moment is `` up , '' its @xmath11 on - site energy for spin up is pushed down while its @xmath11 on - site energy for spin down is pushed up .",
    "the opposite will happen for the body - center cr ion .",
    "the result is that there is no gap in the _ total _",
    "dos for either spin channel , but if one looks only at the dos for one of the cr ions , one can see an approximate gap in one of the spin channels .",
    "thus for this anti - ferromagnetic configuration , there would be a relatively large density of states at the fermi energy for a given spin channel , but only on alernate cr ions .    .",
    "]    comparing these three possibilities , it is not surprising that the ferromagnetic state has the lowest energy , the nonmagnetic state the highest ( 1.02 ev above ferromagnetic ) with the anti - ferromagnetic intermediate between the two ( 0.30 ev above ferromagnetic ) .",
    "thus , the tendency to form a moment in cro@xmath0 is very strong , and the energy associated with the ferromagnetic alignment of moments based on this initial test is moderately large within dft . it should be recognized that other more complicated spin arrangements ( e.  g.  , different antiferromagnetic states ) may have lower energy than the simple one calculated here .",
    "in order to investigate interatomic exchange interactions in cro@xmath0 in more detail , we have calculated the near - neighbor exchange interactions along the ( 100 ) , ( 001 ) , and ( 111 ) directions by rotating moments within specially - constructed supercells .",
    "we fit the resulting relationship between the energy of the system and the angle of rotation to the heisenberg model @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the spin moment , @xmath19 is the electron spin @xmath19-factor , @xmath20 is the spin number , and @xmath21 is the bohr magneton . to make contact with the standard heisenberg model , we can pull the magnitude of the spin moment ( @xmath22 ) into the value of @xmath23 and treat the spins as unit vectors .",
    "in addition to this supercell approach , we have taken advantage of a recently developed feature in the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package@xcite ( vasp ) to calculate a so - called helimagnetic state in which the moment in the @xmath24 magnetic layer is canted by an angle @xmath25 with respect to the @xmath26 layer . in so doing , we are able to calculate several orders of @xmath27 of the form @xmath28 via fourier analysis .",
    "all of the calculations in this study were performed within dft@xcite in the generalized gradient approximation@xcite ( gga ) and in the local ( spin ) density approximation with onsite coulomb interactions ( lsda+u)@xcite using the dudarev method,@xcite for which we use @xmath29 = 3 ev .",
    "we perform all calculations using the vasp software@xcite and pseudopotentials generated by kresse _",
    "_ e__t al.@xcite . to calculate the near - neighbor exchange interactions",
    ", we created a supercell containing two rutile unit cells ( using both experimental and dft - relaxed lattice parameters ) , stacked in either the ( 100 ) ( fig .",
    "[ 100fig ] ) or ( 001 ) ( fig .",
    "[ 001fig ] ) direction as appropriate . in all of the following calculations , we use an energy cut - off of 500 ev . for cells stacked along the ( 100 ) direction",
    ", we use a @xmath30 monkhorst - pack@xcite grid of k - points , a @xmath31 grid for supercells stacked along ( 001 ) , and a @xmath32 grid for the 6-atom cell used in the spin - spiral calculations .",
    "we also make use of the spin interpoloation method of vosko - wilk - nusair.@xcite each of the 12-atom supercells has four cr ions , whose magnetic moments we can individually constrain within the calculation .",
    "we chose three distinct magnetic configurations , designed to probe the exchange coefficients .",
    "in the first configuration , we rotated the moment of a corner cr atom and held all other moments fixed using the constraining field method in vasp . in the second , we rotated the two cr moments in the centers of their respective unit cells , and in the third we rotated a corner atom and its nearest center atom .",
    "a summary of the configurations can be found in table  [ exchtab ] .    .",
    "the bottom half of the structure in figure  [ rutile ] has been projected onto the ( 010 ) plane . ]",
    "has been projected onto the ( 010 ) plane . ]",
    ".magnetic configurations used to calculated exchange coupling .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     using our calculated @xmath33s , we can predict the low - temperature spin - wave contribution to the magnetization as a function of temperature .",
    "a relatively straight - forward generalization of the argument found in kittel@xcite for a cubic system allows one to write the spin - wave dispersion relation for small excitations and long wavelengths as @xmath34 integrating over a surface of constant @xmath35 in @xmath36-space , one obtains a density of states given by @xmath37 using this expression and the planck distribution , we can calculate the coefficient @xmath38 in the @xmath39 model @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of magnetic ions per unit cell ( 2 , in this case ) , @xmath43 is the volume of the cell , and @xmath44 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "fitting the experimental@xcite m(t ) curve yields @xmath45 k@xmath46 . using the spin - wave stiffnesses shown in table  [ tab : stiff ] , we have , for supercells , @xmath47k@xmath46 , @xmath48 k@xmath46 , @xmath49 k@xmath46 , and @xmath50 k@xmath46 . for the spin spiral approach , @xmath51 k@xmath46 , @xmath52 k@xmath46 , @xmath53 k@xmath46 , and @xmath54 k@xmath46 .",
    "thus , the coefficient obtained from gga is within a factor of two , while that derived from lsda+u is off by about a factor of four .",
    "assuming that dft overestimates each exchange energy equally , this implies that our calculated values of @xmath23 may differ from experimental values by about 50% for gga and a factor of about @xmath55 for lsda+u ( with @xmath56 ev ) . in each case , the spin spiral numbers are slightly closer to experiment .",
    "figure  [ fig : magnon ] shows the low - t m(t ) curves from the calculated spin - wave dispersion compared to that from a fit to the experimental m(t ) curve .          in light of the favorable agreement between calculated and experimental spin stiffness",
    ", we subsequently attempted to calculate the magnetic ordering temperature of cro@xmath0 , comparing a mean field prediction to monte carlo simulations .",
    "a mean - field model using the calculated exchange parameters yields a curie temperature several times larger than the measured value of 386.5 k.@xcite the mean - field expression is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is equivalent to half of the energy difference between a ferro- and an antiferromagnetic configuration in a 6-atom ( 2-cr ) cell . using this expression",
    ", we obtain a mean - field curie temperature for cro@xmath0 of 1160 k or 1240 k for the experimental and dft - relaxed lattice parameters in the supercell method , respectively .",
    "this is somewhat surprising given the above analysis of our estimation of the exchange .",
    "however , it is not sufficient to consider only the low - temperature behavior , especially when the system in question has a magnetic ordering temperature above room temperature . in order to gain a simple yet ideally illuminating picture of the temperature dependence",
    ", we utilized a monte carlo simulation using the metropolis - hastings algorithm@xcite with random numbers generated using the mersenne twister method@xcite .",
    "for this simulation , we used a cubic grid of @xmath59 unit cells , where a unit cell consists of a corner and body - centered cr ion .",
    "only cr ions are considered , and they are treated as simple constant - magnitude magnetic moments that initially point along the z axis .",
    "our calculations indicate that the constant - magnitude approximation should be valid as long as the angle between adjacent moments is less than @xmath60 .",
    "we begin with a random spin configuration with the spin vectors chosen to be uniformly distributed on the unit sphere . in the metropolis method , an iteration consists of a randomly chosen cr ion being assigned a magnetic moment in a random direction .",
    "this will result in a change in energy @xmath61e from the old configuration .",
    "if @xmath61e is negative , meaning the new energy is lower , the new direction for that moment is kept .",
    "otherwise , the new direction still has a probability of @xmath62 of being kept in its new orientation to simulate thermal agitation . if neither condition for keeping the moment s new direction is met , then the change is undone , and the lattice of spins remains unmodified until the next iteration .",
    "the calculation of @xmath61e at each step considers all nearest neighbors along ( 100 ) , ( 010 ) , ( 001 ) , and ( 111 ) directions , using a heisenberg interaction between moments with the calculated exchange constants for gga and lsda+u with experimental and dft - relaxed lattice parameters .",
    "figure  [ heiscurie ] shows the simulated results for the magnitude of the net magnetization versus temperature compared to reported values.@xcite when interpreting these data , one must must be cognizant of the fact that the monte carlo simulations exhibit several shortcomings  namely , that it will necessarily not be able to predict the correct low - temperature t - dependence ( as it uses a classical model ) , that there exists an unphysical tail on the curve arising from finite - size effects in the lattice , and that we assume that exchange remains constant with temperature , likely leading to an overestimation of the curie temperature .",
    "the errors in the shape of the curve at low temperature should not have an impact in the accuracy of the result , as each value of @xmath63 is run independently .",
    "further , the high - temperature tail can be accounted for assuming we know where to look for it .",
    "the remaining discrepancy , that the exchange will reduce in strength as temperature rises , is a limitation of exploring this behavior with first - principles calculations . considering these issues , we can attempt to scale the experimental curve to match the calculated one , as we do in fig .",
    "[ heiscurie ] . by matching the portions of the curves at lower temperatures",
    ", we can determine with some confidence where the curve ought to go to zero and thus the true prediction of the model .",
    "by so doing , we find that the monte carlo simulation predicts a curie temperature of between 450 k ( for the gga spin spiral method ) and 650 k ( for the lsda+u supercell method ) , which , even in the latter case , is in much better agreement with experiment than the mean - field model .",
    "we have calculated the near neighbor exchange interactions for bulk cro@xmath0 in the ( 100 ) , ( 001 ) , and ( 111 ) directions , finding them to be @xmath64  mev , @xmath65  mev , and @xmath66  mev respectively . from our calculated spin stiffness parameters and the results of our classical heisenberg metropolis method",
    ", we obtain some confidence that dft and vasp can determine the exchange interaction of cro@xmath0 with reasonable accuracy . examining the calculated exchange parameters , we find that the sign of @xmath67 , both in the supercell and the equivalent spin spiral calculations , indicates the possibility of non - collinear behavior in cro@xmath0 if the exchange parameters are modified .",
    "thus , a mixed interface between cro@xmath0 and another material ( such as ruo@xmath0 ) might lead to non - collinear spins if the ratio between nearest and next - nearest neighbor interactions is pushed into a `` favorable '' zone .",
    "we investigate this possibility explicitly for cro@xmath0-ruo@xmath0 interfaces in a companion paper by k.  chetry _ _ et al__@xcite .",
