    "these single , random and discontinuous events can not be described within the density matrix formalism which gives the ensemble evolution of a collection of independent identical quantum systems or , which is the same , describes the lack of knowledge about the evolving system before a measurement is performed on it .",
    "indeed , if a system evolves from time @xmath29 to time @xmath18 under the effect of the interaction with an environment , and we do not perform any kind of measurements before @xmath18 , we do not have access to any kind of information about the state of the system and all we can do is to describe its state in terms of generally mixed density matrices . on the other hand ,",
    "if the evolution of a system is continuously monitored through measurements on its environment , information about single quantum events are collected all along the dynamics ( and not just at the final time @xmath18 ) and we have at our disposal more information about the state of the open system .",
    "this information , which clearly depends on the measuring scheme employed to monitor the environment , is the core of the physical difference between density matrix formalism and the stochastic wave function method , which is nothing but the theoretical description of such a continuous measuring process on the environment .",
    "results based on this method provide then new insight into the dynamics of a system , and do not trivially just reproduce the knowledge of the density matrix .",
    "the choice of a measuring scheme corresponds to the choice of a particular set of pure states into which to decompose the density matrix itself - and such a set does not need to be orthogonal . in both classical and quantum contexts ,",
    "choosing a pure state decomposition of a mixed state naturally leads to quantify the information content of such a decomposition by employing the so - called shannon entropy , which is well known to be different from the von neumann entropy and to depend on the decomposition itself .    in fts contexts",
    ", it is common to define a backward trajectory as the dissipative process generated by a time inversion of the hamiltonian .",

    "since we decided to extract information about the system by only measuring the environment , one only detects transitions of the open system .",
    "therefore , the backward trajectory is fixed by the requirement that the open system performs transitions at the same time instants as the forward one with rates @xmath35 and jump operators @xmath36 .",
    "the reason is that the lindblad operators in the markovian master equation  ( [ me ] ) and in the weak coupling limit can be divided into two classes @xmath37 and @xmath38 satisfying the conditions @xmath39=\\pm\\epsilon_ia_i^{\\pm}$ ] and @xmath40 @xcite and they thus describe jumps in which an energy quantum @xmath41 is absorbed ( @xmath6 , forward trajectory ) or emitted ( @xmath42 , backward trajectory ) by the open system from / into the environment ( see section  [ examp ] for explicit examples ) .",
    "this is the case in many important experimental setups such as , e.g. , the many photodetection schemes often employed . on the other hand ,",
    "the action of the nonunitary operator @xmath43 on a state during the drift interval @xmath44 $ ] reduces its norm in time , describing the decrease of probability of the no - jump event . therefore , as the backward process itself is a physical dissipative process detected by measurements , its associated drift operator @xmath45 has to describe such a decrease of probability along the backward drifts , taking into account that a backward drift propagates the state of the system from time @xmath9 to time @xmath8 such that @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the hermitian part of the operator generating backward evolutions has to be unchanged , but its nonhermitian part has to be sign - reversed : this is achieved if one defines @xmath47 .",
    "this means , however , that the final state of the backward process may be different from the initial state of the forward one , as in general @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    in this paper",
    "we denote by @xmath50 the normalized state of the forward ( backward ) process right before the jump at time @xmath14 , and by @xmath51 the normalized state of the forward ( backward ) process right after the jump at time @xmath14 .",

    "therefore , we aim at giving explicit expressions for entropy contributions along pdps .     jumps ( vertical red arrows ) .",
    "the backward process is characterized by jumps through the channels @xmath57 and by deterministic evolution periods according to @xmath58 . ]",
    "a single quantum trajectory ( either forward or backward ) , being a nonequilibrium process , is characterized by a nonzero entropy production . in the ensemble picture ,",
    "the entropy of a system is given by its von neumann entropy @xmath59 .",
    "however , as commented in section  [ stochwave ] , when employing a quantum unraveling procedure , one describes a single realization of the system dynamics under a particular , fixed measurement scheme .",
    "therefore , one has to quantify the amount of information extractable about a particular system when its environment is monitored or , which is the same , the amount of information available in a particular pure state decomposition of a density matrix ( such a pure state decomposition corresponds to the set of all possible trajectories generated by the fixed measuring scheme ) . in quantum contexts , a natural way to quantify the information content of such a decomposition is the so - called shannon entropy @xmath60\\ln p[\\psi , t]$ ] .",
    "consequently , the single trajectory contribution to the entropy can be defined as @xmath61=-\\ln p[\\psi , t]$ ] .",
    "such an entropy , which clearly depends on the chosen decomposition , has been used in various contexts @xcite to quantify information beyond the standard von neumann one : it is worth stressing that a given decomposition yields more information on the system than the one available in the density matrix only @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we will refer to such a quantity as _",
    "quantum entropy_. note that its mathematical definition is formally analogous to the one employed for entropy in classical stochastic processes @xcite . on the ensemble level the time derivative of the open system quantum entropy",

    "it describes the knowledge about the open quantum system , extracted by an external observer measuring the environment and , as single realizations of quantum dynamics are fundamentally different from their classical counterpart , the information thus extracted can not in general be given any classical interpretation . exploiting the explicit form of the master equation for @xmath17 $ ] @xcite , it is possible to show that the single trajectory contribution to eq .",

    "since both quantum jumps and drifts are detected by measurements , each of these terms describes a change in knowledge of the external observer about the open system .",
    "in addition , we show in what follows that both the jump and the drift entropic terms contribute to entropy production along the nonequilibrium process .      as @xmath64\\mathrm{d}t$ ] and @xmath65\\mathrm{d}t$ ] only take into account the difference of entropy between initial and final states , but not the features of the transition connecting them , these terms then do not fully describe the information content of unraveling measurements : there are indeed two corresponding terms describing information about transitions , detected in the environment , and which correspond then to entropy flowing from the open quantum system to its bath . since the full system is out of equilibrium the changes in open quantum system entropy and the flux to the bath are not the same in absolute value .",

    "@xmath177 is very close to @xmath201 in the case of a weakly decaying and driven system ( @xmath202 ) and increases smoothly with @xmath73 with a power - law like shape .",
    "also in the case of the homodyne - like scheme a clear increasing trend is detected which suggests a monotonic increase of @xmath177 with @xmath187 , properly described by a quadratic function of @xmath203 .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that , in the case of a thermal bath , @xmath177 increases quadratically with the average photon number @xmath190 but does not tend to @xmath201 for @xmath204 , since also in the case of a zero temperature bath the system can perform quantum jumps and undergoes nontrivial drifts , resulting in a nonvanishing nonthermal entropy flux .",
    "these features may reasonably be employed to properly engineer a class of nonequilibrium processes with particular stochastic properties of entropy production .",
    "we have obtained an expression for stochastic entropy production along a purely quantum trajectory of a driven open system , defined through continuous measurements on the environment only .",
    "the quantum entropy thus defined , which is fundamentally different from the commonly employed von neumann entropy , describes the observer s gain / loss of information about the open system along single realizations of quantum dynamics and , contrarily to previous approaches to quantum fts , does not require any knowledge on the ensemble dynamics of the open system , given by the solution of the master equation  ( [ me ] ) .",
    "we showed that the flux of such an entropy is not only associated to energy flux from / into the bath , defying common classical thermodynamic expectations .",
    "the additional information term results from purely quantum fluctuations of the transition operators along a trajectory . due to this additional term",
    ", the quantum entropy of a stochastic trajectory does not obey the usual form of integral fluctuation theorem : the quantum correction @xmath127 in eq .",
    "( [ totft ] ) depends on the set of jump operators employed to unravel the master equation , and ultimately describes the difference between the physical backward trajectory and the fictitious reversed processes . in other words ,",
    "such a correction is due to the lack of symmetry between forward and backward processes , which in turn originates from the existence of an external observer performing measurements on the bath to detect transitions .",
    "in the main manuscript we showed that nonthermal contributions to entropy flux originate from purely quantum fluctuations of a certain kind of operators , either jump operators @xmath205 or drift operators @xmath206 . here we want to analyze the structure of these fluctuations along nonunitary evolutions . during a drift interval",
    "@xmath207 $ ] , information is extracted by measuring the environment at a constant rate @xmath208 . therefore the total information extracted is given by a sum of small contributions , each of which originates from one of the @xmath209 measuring processes and originates from the quantum fluctuations of the operator @xmath210 .",
    "we assume here the most general situation , in which @xmath211 depends on time and @xmath212\\neq 0 $ ] so that the use of the time - ordering operator @xmath213 is needed .",
    "since in the stochastic wave function method one always assumes @xmath79 to be very small ( @xmath214 ) , one can keep only terms up to order @xmath116 in the dyson expansion of the drift operator . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we introduce the hermitian operator @xmath215 , so that @xmath216 , and the operators @xmath217    with these notations one obtains @xmath218 and , up to order @xmath116 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 with simple calculations one can now evaluate @xmath221}(\\delta t)\\equiv\\mathrm{var}_1^{[\\psi]}(u(\\delta t)^{\\dag}u(\\delta t))$ ] on a generic state @xmath21 .",

    "it is worth stressing that in eq .",
    "( [ varudu ] ) the first non vanishing contribution is of order @xmath116 , while the term @xmath225 has also contributions of order @xmath226 and @xmath79 : this means that the drift entropy flux can be made vanishingly small by choosing a very high measurement rate , such that all terms of order @xmath116 become negligible .",
    "note however that there are at least two lower bounds to @xmath79 : one is given by the measurement speed of the experimental apparatus , which is not infinite .",
    "the other one is given by the requirement that the dynamics is not frozen due to zeno effect : therefore @xmath79 has to be always greater than the zeno time of the total system .",
    "these two limitations , in some cases , may lead to a nonvanishing drift entropy flux , which is then a quantity of real physical interest .",
