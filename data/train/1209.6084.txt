    "the einstein condition is essential here , as opposed to mere negativity of the ricci curvature @xmath30 : in fact , leite and dotti @xcite constructed ( non - einstein ) left - invariant riemannian metrics with @xmath31 on @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "also , all noncompact lie groups known to admit left - invariant riemannian einstein metrics are solvable .",

    "we study left - invariant connections on @xmath19 , which are also holomorphic when @xmath62 , as well as left - invariant metrics on @xmath19 , assuming the latter to be pseuriemannian if @xmath63 , and holomorphic ( in the sense of being @xmath64-bilinear , symmetric and nondegenerate ) if @xmath62 .    in this section",
    "we skip the term ` left - invariant ' and simply speak of connections in @xmath38 and metrics in @xmath34 .",

    "the set @xmath82 of all weakeinstein connections in @xmath38 thus contains the set @xmath35 of einstein connections in @xmath34 , defined here to be the lecivita connections @xmath80 of ( left - invariant ) einstein metrics @xmath83 on @xmath19 . by the latter we mean , as usual ,",

    "we choose to look for weakeinstein connections in @xmath34 . by ( [ nde ] )",
    ", the latter question is only slightly more general than the former .",
    "it can , however , be phrased in much simpler algebraic terms : for @xmath90 given by @xmath91 ( the left - hand side in ( [ nnn ] ) with @xmath74 ) , @xmath92while @xmath93 is a ( nonhomogeneous ) cubic polynomial mapping , due to the quadratic dependence of @xmath77 on @xmath78 .    enlarging the space of unknowns , we rewrite the cubic condition @xmath94 as a system of quadratic equations .",

    "in addition , @xmath142 one specific vector @xmath143 , given by formula ( [ fhz ] ) , has @xmath144 in section  [ mr ] we use @xmath145 to define a family @xmath41 of einstein connections by @xmath146:a\\in\\mathfrak{g}\\hs\\,\\mathrm{\\ and\\   } \\,a^2\\nh=0\\})\\hh,\\ ] ] which appears as formula ( [ cdl ] ) ; @xmath147 is the cartesian projection .    that every @xmath148 is a weakeinstein connection ( or , equivalently , @xmath149 for the corresponding @xmath150 , cf .",

    "evaluating @xmath77 and using ( [ nde ] ) we now conclude that every @xmath161 is in fact an einstein connection .",
    "the most important further step consists in showing , in section  [ ra ] , that @xmath162 assertion ( [ thf ] ) easily implies the crucial part of our main result ( theorem  [ mnres ] ) : @xmath163 for @xmath164 , ( [ sfc ] ) states that a positive - definite multiple of the killing form is isolated among suitably normalized left - invariant riemannian einstein metrics on @xmath165 .",
    "the mechanism which reduces proving the inclusion in ( [ sfc ] ) to establishing the analogous claim ( [ thf ] ) for real - analytic  curves is a version of milnor s selection lemma @xcite , stated below as corollary  [ equal ] , and applicable in our case since both @xmath41 and @xmath82 are algebraic sets .",
    "the rest of this section is devoted to summarizing the proof of ( [ thf ] ) given in section  [ ra ] .",
    "the argument is based on the fundamental formula ( [ fin ] ) along with the following fact ( lemma  [ neglg](ii ) ) : suppose that a vector - valued polynomial function @xmath166 of ( [ abg ] ) is negligible and ( [ abg ] ) are themselves @xmath167 functions of a variable @xmath168 , with @xmath169 , which turns @xmath166 into a function of @xmath170 , and @xmath171 is an integer .",

    "our polynomial mapping @xmath188 takes values in @xmath189 , as its first component is @xmath155 , while @xmath190 at our point @xmath145 with @xmath191 .",

    "thus , when @xmath1282 and @xmath102 is odd , @xmath1291 is an @xmath1296 bundle over @xmath1273 , with the bundle projection @xmath1297 and the fibre @xmath1298 over @xmath1299 . for @xmath1300 and even @xmath894",

    "in fact , all equalities in ( [ sys ] ) except ( [ sys].iv ) , and the values of @xmath1332 , are easily verified by treating @xmath1333 as arbitrary and substituting @xmath1334 for @xmath1335 in ( [ sys].vii ) .",
    "we then also have @xmath1336 and @xmath1337 .",
    "since @xmath1338 in ( [ nsl ] ) , the assumption ( [ ahx ] ) in theorem  [ xmpls ] amounts to requiring that @xmath1339 be a specific positive multiple of @xmath801 .",
    "such @xmath1009 exists for any triple ( [ lie ] ) as long as @xmath1340 is even .",
    "consequently , ( [ nsl ] ) with @xmath1341 and any even @xmath861 gives rise , via theorem  [ xmpls ] , to examples of unimodular connections @xmath80 such that @xmath1342 .",
    "they are not , however , einstein connections , since @xmath1343 is degenerate and nonzero .",
    "namely , as explained below , @xmath707 lies in the nullspace of @xmath1344 ( and @xmath1083 by ( [ ahx ] ) with @xmath1345 ) , while @xmath1346 .    specifically , since @xmath1347 , @xmath1348 , and @xmath1349 by ( [ cea ] ) , using the three steps of remark  [ trsln ] to evaluate traces , we get @xmath1350 therefore @xmath1081 , if nonzero , is an eigenvector , for the eigenvalue @xmath1351 , of the linear endomorphism of @xmath38 corresponding to @xmath1352 via ( [ sgv ] ) , while the trace of that endomorphism is @xmath1353 , with @xmath382 as in ( [ inp].i ) .",
    "the claim concerning the eigenvalue is obvious here from ( [ taa ] ) , the equalities @xmath1354 and @xmath1355 , immediate from the assumption @xmath1007 ( that is , ( [ ahx ] ) ) and ( [ bec ] ) or , respectively , from ( [ dsh ] ) and lemma  [ neglg](i ) .    the above conclusions about the eigenvalue and trace apply to @xmath1356 for all connections @xmath80 arising from theorem  [ xmpls ] . in the special case ( [ nsl ] ) , with @xmath1333",
