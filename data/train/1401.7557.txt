    "( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) provide a good fit to these data , albeit with a somewhat too small exponent @xmath121 . in view of this discrepancy",
    "one should keep in mind the rather complex electrostatic properties of polyelectrolytes .",
    "the reduction observed for both napss and dna can not be explained by hydrodynamic effects .",
    "interchain interactions are of little significance because of the low dilution .",
    "indeed , the effective volume fraction of the polymer coils hardly attains a few percent , @xmath122 ; thus nearby chains do not overlap and leave both the viscosity and the diffusion coefficient unchanged .",
    "regarding hydrodynamic interactions of beads of the same molecule , it is known that they enhance the electrophoretic mobility in ( [ 1b ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) with increasing chain length .  yet",
    "this effect occurs for short polyelectrolytes and saturates for chains longer than the size of the screening cloud @xcite ; for the examples studied here , it would enhance @xmath2 in the range @xmath123 .",
    "we conclude that hydrodynamic effects may ruled out as an explanation for the reduction shown in fig .",
    ". finally we discuss electrostatic single - particle effects . the electrophoretic mobility in saltfree solution has been found to decrease slightly at higher concentration , because of the increase of the overall ionic strength and the shorter screening length @xcite . in the present case , however , the weight fraction of the polyelectrolyte is constant , and so is the overall charge density .",

    "the negative sign of the measured @xmath2 indicates that the thermoelectric contribution @xmath125 to ( [ 2 ] ) overtakes the ruckenstein term @xcite @xmath126the negative surface potential @xmath7 implies that the thermopotential parameter of the sulpho - rhodamine solution is positive , @xmath127 .    the curves in fig .",
    "2b are calculated from ( [ 4a ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) with @xmath128 mv , which is comparable to common salts and weaker than the values of naoh and tetraethylammonium @xcite .",

    "the dashed line gives the mobility @xmath69 in the zero - dilution limit , whereas the solid lines are given by ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the explicit concentration dependence in terms of the parameter @xmath82 , one has to take into account that , even at moderate colloidal volume fraction , the einstein coefficient @xmath77 is not constant.indeed , cooperative diffusion of charged particles arises from the electrostatic pair potential @xmath132 and , to a lesser extent , from hydrodynamic interactions @xcite . to linear order in the concentration , the virial expansion for the einstein coefficient reads as@xmath133with the parameter @xmath134for hard spheres the virial coefficient is given by the particle volume , @xmath135 with @xmath136 .  the electrostatic pair potential results in an effective interaction volume @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the debye length and @xmath139 a numerical factor @xcite",

    "unfortunately there are no mobility data for micelles ; thus at present it is not possible to determine whether their @xmath2 is subject to collective effects similar to those of polyelectrolytes and solid beads .",
    "in summary , charged colloids in a non - uniform temperature show collective transport behavior mediated by the seebeck effect of both colloidal and salt ions . for large particles and macromolecules , cooperative effects set in at rather low concentration , where hydrodynamic interactions are absent and where the charge ratio @xmath82 is much smaller than unity .",
    "the criterion for the onset of collective behavior , @xmath153 in ( [ 8 ] ) , involves the ratio of the electrophoretic mobility and the einstein coefficient ; by contrast , the criterion for cooperative diffusion , @xmath154 , depends on the pair potential of the solute particles .",
    "the discussed examples suggest that the collective thermoelectric effect is generic for colloids at ordinary concentrations .",
    "this issue could be relevant for microfluidic applications of thermophoresis .",
    "we conclude with a remark on the thermoelectric field given in eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) . both its magnitude and its sign can be tuned by chosing the appropriate electrolyte and adjusting the charge ratio . with a thermal gradient of less than one kelvin per micron , @xmath11 may attain values of 100 v / m .",
