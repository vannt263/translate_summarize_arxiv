    "cubic graphs naturally fall into two classes depending on whether they do or do not admit a @xmath6-edge - colouring . besides the trivial family of graphs with bridges , which are trivially uncolourable ,",
    "there are many examples of @xmath7-edge - connected cubic graphs that do not admit a @xmath6-edge - colouring .",
    "such graphs are called _ snarks _ ; sometimes they are required to satisfy additional conditions , such as cyclic @xmath8-edge - connectivity and girth at least five , to avoid triviality .    in their many attempts to understand snarks better ,",
    "researchers have come up with various measures that refine the notion of `` being close to 3-edge - colourable '' . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we introduce a new such measure closely related to oddness and resistance .",
    "we follow @xcite in our presentation of these two concepts .",
    "every bridgeless cubic graph has a @xmath9-factor @xcite and consequently also a @xmath7-factor .",
    "it is easy to see that a cubic graph is @xmath6-edge - colourable if and only if it has a @xmath7-factor that only consists of even circuits .",
    "in other words , snarks are those cubic graphs which have an odd circuit in every @xmath7-factor .",
    "the minimum number of odd circuits in a @xmath7-factor of a bridgeless cubic graph @xmath1 is its _ oddness _ , and is denoted by @xmath4 . since every cubic graph has even number of vertices , its oddness must also be even .",
    "the relevance of oddness stems from the importance of snarks .",
    "the crux of many important problems and conjectures , like the tutte s @xmath10-flow conjecture or the cycle double cover conjecture , consists in dealing with snarks .",
    "while most of these problems are exceedingly difficult for snarks in general , they are often tractable for those that are close to being @xmath6-edge - colourable . for example , the @xmath10-flow conjecture has been verified for snarks with oddness at most @xmath7 ( jaeger @xcite ) and for cyclically @xmath11-edge - connected snarks with oddness at most @xmath8 @xcite , and the cycle double cover conjecture has been verified for snarks with oddness at most @xmath8 ( huck and kochol @xcite , hggkvist and mcguinness @xcite ) .",
    "snarks with large oddness thus remain potential counterexamples to these conjectures and therefore deserve further study .",
    "another natural measure of uncolourability of a cubic graph is based on minimising the use of the fourth colour in a @xmath8-edge - colouring of a cubic graph , which can alternatively be viewed as minimising the number of edges that have to be deleted in order to get a @xmath6-edge - colourable graph .",
    "surprisingly , the required number of edges to be deleted is the same as the number of vertices that have to be deleted in order to get a @xmath6-edge - colourable graph ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.7 ) ) .",
    "this quantity is called the _ resistance _ of @xmath1 , and will be denoted by  @xmath3 .",
    "observe that @xmath12 for every bridgeless cubic graph @xmath1 since deleting one edge from each odd circuit in a @xmath7-factor leaves a colourable graph .",
    "the difference between @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be arbitrarily large in general @xcite .",
    "a _ factor _ of a graph @xmath1 is a subgraph containing all vertices of @xmath1 .",
    "the most commonly encountered factors are those defined by vertex degrees : for instance , a @xmath9-factor is a spanning subgraph whose all vertices have degree @xmath9 .",
    "there is , however , an almost endless list of other variants of factors ; we refer the reader to the excellent surveys @xcite for an overview . one important kind of factors are _ even factors _ , that is , factors with all vertices of even degree @xcite . even factors play a profound role in the areas of flows and cycle covers where snarks are especially relevant .",
    "it is , therefore , very natural to introduce a measure of uncolourability based on even factors : the _ weak oddness _ of a cubic graph @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath13 , is the least number of odd components in an even factor of @xmath1 .",
    "( we do not need to avoid graphs with bridges in the definition since every graph has an even factor containing just isolated vertices . )    in a cubic graph , an even factor is comprised of circuits and isolated vertices , thus it can be viewed as a relaxation of @xmath7-factor where `` degenerated '' circuits of length @xmath9 are allowed . since every @xmath7-factor is an even factor , @xmath14 . on the other hand ,",
    "we can remove a vertex from each odd component of an even factor of a graph @xmath1 , and thus obtain a @xmath6-edge - colourable graph , so @xmath15 .",
    "the new invariant @xmath0 thus approximates resistance from above more tightly than oddness , and approximates oddness from below more tightly than resistance . of course",
    ", the enhanced approximation potential materializes only if weak oddness differs from both oddness and resistance .",
    "we demonstrate that this is indeed the case in section  [ construction ] .",
    "besides that , there are several reasons why we think weak oddness is useful .",
    "first , weak oddness does not change when we contract a triangle . on the other hand , as we will show in section  [ conc ] , contracting a triangle can increase oddness arbitrarily .",
    "we hope that this property might improve the chance of developing inductive methods based on oddness .",
    "second , many results for graphs with small oddness can be easily transformed to results for graphs with small weak oddness .",
    "as @xmath16 might be larger than @xmath0 , the modified statements comprise a larger family of graphs . as a potential example we give the following .    [ cdcthm ] graphs with weak oddness at most @xmath8 have a cycle - double cover .",
    "let @xmath1 be a graph with weak oddness @xmath8 .",
    "let us replace each vertex of @xmath1 with a triangle , obtaining a graph @xmath17 .",
    "every even factor of @xmath1 can be naturally extended to a @xmath7-factor of @xmath17 , thus the oddness of @xmath18 is at most @xmath8 . as graphs with oddness at most @xmath8 have a cycle double cover @xcite , the graph @xmath17 has a cycle double cover .",
    "this cover reduced to the edges of @xmath1 is a cycle double cover of @xmath1 .",
    "it is known that if @xmath19 ( and thus @xmath20 ) , then @xmath21 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.5 ) and thus @xmath22 . for graphs with resistance more than @xmath7 , resistance and oddness may be distinct @xcite . in section  [ construction ]",
    "we find a graph with weak oddness @xmath23 and oddness @xmath24 which illustrates that weak oddness and oddness can differ .",
    "we do not know , however , whether weak odness and oddness can be different for graphs with weak oddness smaller than @xmath23 . in particular , the following is an open problem .",
    "does there exist a cubic graph with weak oddness @xmath8 and oddness at least @xmath11 ?    if the answer to this question is affirmative , then theorem  [ cdcthm ] is more general than the original theorem requiring oddness at most @xmath8 .",
    "our construction utilizes smaller blocks to build larger graphs . a _ @xmath7-pole _ is a triple @xmath26 , where @xmath1 is a graph and @xmath27 , @xmath28 are two different vertices of @xmath1 which both have degree one ; we will call them _ terminals _ and the edges incident to them _",
    "terminal edges_. each terminal of a @xmath7-pole serves as a place of connection with another terminal .",
    "two terminal edges of two disjoint @xmath7-poles can be naturally joined to form a new nonterminal edge by identifying the terminal vertices incident to them and suppressing the resulting @xmath7-valent vertex .",
    "a standard way to create terminal vertices is by _ splitting off _ a vertex @xmath29 from a graph  @xmath1 ; by this we mean removing @xmath29 from @xmath1 and attaching a terminal vertex to each dangling edge originally incident with @xmath29 .",
    "the first step in our construction is to create the @xmath7-pole @xmath30 depicted in fig .",
    "[ diamond ] .",
    "let @xmath31 be the @xmath7-pole obtained from the petersen graph by inserting a new vertex into one of its edges and then splitting the new vertex off .",
    "( the petersen graph is edge - transitive , so the result of our operation is uniquely determined . )",
    "we take two copies @xmath32 , @xmath33 of @xmath31 , identify @xmath34 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 with @xmath37 , and attach a new terminal edge to both of @xmath34 and @xmath36 .",
    "-pole @xmath30 ( its terminal vertices are marked by empty circles ) .",
    "]    the next step is to create the @xmath7-pole @xmath38 by taking two copies of @xmath31 and joining a terminal edge of the first copy to a terminal edge of the second copy .",
    "finally , we take the complete graph on four vertices @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and remove all edges incident with @xmath39 . then , for each @xmath43 , we take a new copy of @xmath38 and identify one of its terminals with @xmath39 and the other with @xmath44 .",
    "we denote the resulting cubic graph @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ thegraph ] ) .    .",
    "]    if an even factor @xmath45 of @xmath1 contains a cycle @xmath46 passing through a non - terminal vertex of a copy @xmath47 of @xmath30 , but not lying in @xmath47 , then @xmath47 contains at least three odd components of @xmath45 different from @xmath46 . [ passing ]",
    "if @xmath46 passes through @xmath30 , it passes through non - terminal vertices of exactly one copy of @xmath31 contained in @xmath30 .",
    "in that copy , there is at least one odd component of @xmath45 apart from @xmath46 . in the other copy of @xmath31",
    ", there must be at least two odd components , because the petersen is not @xmath6-edge - colourable .",
    "the resistance , weak oddness , and oddness of the graph @xmath1 are @xmath48 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "[ main ]    first , we determine the resistance of @xmath1 .",
    "consider a copy of @xmath31 included in @xmath30 . if we remove a vertex at distance @xmath6 from both terminals from it , the rest is @xmath6-edge - colourable in such a way that the colours of terminal edges of @xmath31 are different ( one possible colouring is presented in fig .",
    "[ colouring ] ) .",
    "consequently , it is possible to remove two vertices of @xmath30 ( one from each copy of @xmath31 ) and properly colour the edges of the remaining graph with @xmath6 colours so that the terminal edges of @xmath30 have the same colour . in other words",
    ", @xmath30 behaves just like an edge for our purpose , and so does @xmath38 , so we are essentially colouring just @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , by removing @xmath48 vertices from @xmath1 ( two from each copy of @xmath31 ) , we obtain a @xmath6-edge - colourable graph . on the other hand ,",
    "if we do not remove a vertex from @xmath31 , it is not @xmath6-edge - colourable .",
    "this proves that @xmath50 .",
    "assume that @xmath45 is an even factor of @xmath1 with minimum number of odd cycles .",
    "if @xmath39 is an isolated vertex in @xmath45 , then there are at least @xmath48 odd circuits in the copies of @xmath31 , and one more triangle in the rest of the graph .",
    "if @xmath39 is not isolated in @xmath45 , then some four copies of @xmath30 are passed through by a circuit of @xmath45 , so , by lemma  [ passing ] , they contain at least @xmath51 odd circuits .",
    "each of the remaining two copies of @xmath30 contain at least two odd circuits . in either case , @xmath45 has at least @xmath23 odd components , and so @xmath52 .",
    "next , we describe an even factor @xmath45 of @xmath1 which contains @xmath39 as an isolated vertex and has @xmath23 odd components .",
    "no copy of @xmath30 is passed through by @xmath45 .",
    "the petersen graph has a @xmath7-factor comprised of two @xmath10-circuits , and thus @xmath30 has a @xmath7-factor composed of two @xmath10-circuits ( one in each copy of @xmath31 ) and one @xmath48-circuit .",
    "altogether , @xmath45 is comprised of six @xmath48-circuits , twelve @xmath10-circuits , one triangle @xmath53 , and one isolated vertex .",
    "consequently , @xmath54 .",
    "finally , we determine the oddness of @xmath1 . in every @xmath7-factor of @xmath1 , the vertex @xmath39 belongs to a circuit of @xmath45 , and this circuit must thus pass through four copies of @xmath30 . according to lemma  [ passing ] ,",
    "those copies of @xmath30 contain at least @xmath48 odd circuits of @xmath45 , and each of the remaining two copies of @xmath30 contains at least two odd circuits of @xmath45 .",

    "-edge - colouring of @xmath31 without a vertex . ]",
    "as can be easily seen from the proof of theorem  [ main ] , the construction can be modified by using more copies of @xmath30 in @xmath38 , which would lead to an arbitrarily large difference between oddness and weak oddness .",
    "if we also insert one copy of @xmath38 into each of the edges @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the difference between weak oddness and resistance grows to @xmath8 : it is enough to delete one vertex in each copy of @xmath31 in order to get a @xmath6-edge - colourable graph , but we have to include all the isolated vertices @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 in an even factor to have only one odd component in each copy of @xmath31 . for an even larger difference , we can take a large @xmath6-edge - colourable cubic graph and insert a copy of @xmath38 into each of its edges .",
    "besides showing that resistance , weak oddness , and oddness can be all distinct , we can also make the following observation .",
    "if we expand the vertex @xmath39 of @xmath1 into a triangle , the resulting graph will have oddness @xmath23 , while @xmath1 has oddness @xmath24 .",
    "thus expanding a vertex into a triangle can decrease oddness . by using more copies of @xmath30 to produce @xmath38",
    "we can obtain a graph in which the expansion of @xmath39 into a triangle can decrease the oddness by as much as we wish ( without changing its parity , of course ) .",
    "while we have demonstrated that weak oddness might differ from oddness , we have very little insight into a characterisation of graphs for which @xmath59 .",

    "on the one hand , a snark with edge cuts of size @xmath7 can have vastly different values of @xmath16 and @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
