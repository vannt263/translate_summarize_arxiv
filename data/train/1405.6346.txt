    "the purpose of our spectroscopic survey of selected objects associated with the dark cloud ldn1655 ( lynds 1962 ) is threefold : i ) to detect its concomitant pre - main sequence stars , if any ( i.e. to our knowledge , no such young stars have been reported in the literature ) , mainly the stars associated with iras06548 - 0815 , ii ) to derive a photometric distance to the cloud ldn1655 on hand of its associated ( young blue ) nebulous stars and iii ) to locate its presumed young stars in the hertzprung - russell diagram . on the following ,",
    "we give a brief review of previous findings of the region .",
    "a quick inspection of the red poss image of the region revealed a diffuse hii region obscured by a `` hammer - shaped '' dust lane in its foreground , the latter containing and , among other infrared sources and stars associated with reflection nebulosity ( n- or r - stars , see figure  1 ) .",
    "star ( @xmath4 , an a2v star at a distance @xmath5pc , this paper ) is the apparent brightest optical object of the region shown in figure  1 , located at its top - center section .",
    "the infrared source stands out from the other sources of the region because of its mid infrared colors and morphology : it is a compact orion - like trapezium entangled in reflection nebulosity ( magnier et al .",
    "the trapezium contains at least five nebulous stars , reminiscent of other similar very young stellar ensembles studied by our group ( e.g. chavarra - k et al .",
    "1987 , 1989 , 2005 ; moreno - corral et al .",
    "1993 , 2002 , 2006 ; see also gyulbudaghian 1995 ) , its stellar constituents could be medium and low - mass young stars . in support of this and",
    "considering that such clusters are loosely bound and hence subject to disruption by gravitational pull , the tightness of iras06548 - 0815 stellar aggregate ( angular and linear dimeter @xmath6 , @xmath7 pc , respectively , assuming a distance to ldn1655 @xmath8 kpc , see @xmath9 ) signalizes us that gravity has not had the time to disperse it .",
    "in addition , t tauri stars are known to drift from their birth places typically with @xmath10 ( e.g. herbig 1977 ) .",
    "thus , the cluster crossing time for the case of iras06548 - 0815 is @xmath11 yr ( i.e. about the time required by an adiabatic perturbation to cross the primitive knot ) , which is to be considered approximately the age of the complex .",
    "yet no report about the nature of its constituyents was found in the literature by us , except for two failed studies in radio wavelengths searching for massive ( young ) star formation ( codella et al .",
    "1995 ; magnier et al .",
    "moreover , a closer inspection of the _ 2mass _ near - infrared ( nir ) images of iras06548 - 0815 revealed us a tight spherical cluster of @xmath12 stars tightly packed into a small volume ( stellar density @xmath13pc@xmath14 , see figure  2 ) , remembrancing other ( bright h@xmath15 ) knots of known youth .",
    "little is known about the region . besides the information given in the dark nebulae catalog ( ldn , lynds 1962 ) and the iras point source catalogue ( neugebauer et al .",

    "regarding iras06547 - 0810 , besides the dark cloud nebulae and the iras catalog , no other references were retrieved by simbad . only a single star is seen to be associated with the source in both poss ( blue & red ) prints , and in the off - set guider monitors of the 2.1 and 0.84 m telescopes , as well as in the _",

    "spectroscopy of iras06547 - 0810 , together with that of other r- or n - stars in the region and their corresponding near infrared photometry enables us to directly estimate the distance to ldn1655 , which has not been done previously .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : @xmath16 describes the observations and reduction techniques ; @xmath17 contains the spectroscopic results of the optically bright stars associated with iras06548 - 0815 , and of the ( single ) stars exciting iras06547 - 0810 , nj065703.0 - 081421 and nj065714.1 - 081016 ; in @xmath18 we derive a distance to ldn  1655 , based on our spectroscopic results and the _ 2mass _ photometry ; in @xmath19 we locate the bright stars associated with iras06548 - 0815 and ldn  1655 in the hertzprung - russell diagram ; in @xmath20 we discuss the expected errors ; and finally , in @xmath21 we discuss our results and give our conclusions .",
    "in january 2006 we acquired low - resolution spectra ( @xmath22 at h@xmath15 ) of the brightest stars associated with iras06548 - 0815 .",
    "we used the _",

    "the detector was masked for our convenience to a width of 275 pixel perpendicular to the dispersion or right ascension axis .",
    "the plate scale is 0.347 \" /pix .",
    "this ccd detector is linear over a wide dynamical range , with no significant fringing  even by @xmath25  .",
    "the slit had an effective aperture of 150 @xmath26 m ( or @xmath27 , sky projected ) .",
    "a diffraction grating with a 600 lines mm@xmath28 ruling and blazed at @xmath29 was used in the first order for the observations .",
    "the grid angle was fixed at @xmath30 , optimizing the spectral resolution by the h@xmath15 region ( spectral resolution = 3.9   ) . the central wavelength of the spectrograms was @xmath31   and the spectral range covered was @xmath32@xmath33 , with a dispersion of 2.07   @xmath34 , but since the detector s surface normal was tilted with respect to the optical axis in the dispersion direction , the spectral resolution degraded accordingly and the spectrograms became noiser and wider at wavelengths shorter than about 5500  , concentrating our analysis at longer wavelengths than this .",
    "the spectral region observed was leaned to the yellow - red spectral region where the nai - d , h@xmath15 , lii@xmath35  , cai@xmath36  , the [ oi ] , [ nii ] and [ sii ] nebular lines are , as well as the tio bands .",

    "stars g and g1 ( see figure  2 ) seemed to be nebulous in the off - set guider monitor with an integration time of 15 s and were included in the present survey .",
    "a second run was allotted to the program in february 2008 with the spmo 84 cm telescope ( f/15 ) .",
    "the b&ch spectrograph ( model 26767 ) was attached to its cassegrain focus , provided with a bausch & lomb diffraction grid ( ruled to 400 lines mm@xmath28 and blazed at @xmath39 to optimize first - order observations ) .",
    "the ccd site # 3 and its respective housing were used to register the spectrograms .",
    "the spectrograph s slit had discrete width settings : we used the 80 @xmath26 m ( 131 sky - projected ) slit width , since it met better our requirements .",
    "the seeing was measured from the ( guided ) fwhm intensity tracings and was @xmath405 , normally 10 .",
    "the grid angle was set at @xmath41 to embrace the spectral range of the 2006 observing run at the 2.1 m telescope .",
    "the same cuhenear arc lamp was used to calibrate in wavelength the dispersion axis .",
    "the resulting dispersion and resolution at h@xmath15 were 3.07  / pixel and 6.1  , respectively .",
    "the same alignment issue of the detector we had in the previous run at the 2.1 m telescope persisted , combined with more serious alignment problems of the dewar with spectrograph . as a result of this , the spectrogram tracings flared for shorter wavelenghts , making them useless for our purposes at wavelenghts @xmath42 .",
    "the sky - projected pixel size was 0393 at h@xmath15 .",
    "s / n ratio of the spectrograms was typically @xmath43 ( i.e. @xmath44 m  precision in the line equivalent width measurements ) , about 10 for the weaker stars . in the 2008 run the observations were near their limit of detection in a reasonable integration time ( @xmath45 sec ) for a useful spectrogram .",
    "the reduction of the spectrograms was done following standard procedures with iraf software package ( massey et al .",
    "the resulting spectrograms were normalized for spectral classification purposes .",

    "( 1984 ) and the spmo libraries of spectrograms of stars with known mk spectral types was carried out , and when necessary , assisted by the moore ( 1945 ) multiplet table for line identification purposes ( see also chavarra - k et al .",
    "the tio band heads were also considered , particularly for the noisier spectrograms of the cooler stars . except for the balmer lines and the nai - d and cai resonance lines , the ratio of different lines for an even finer effective stellar temperature or luminosity determination were senseless because of the noise of the spectrograms ( see figures 3 to 5 ) .",
    "the resulting spectral types of program stars are given in table  1 , column 4 .",

    "the spectrogram of the late type star  j   is too noisy to draw any conclusion about its nature .",
    "the main error in the determination of the mk spectral type of a given star lies in the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of the spectra of both the program stars and comparison stars , and in the assigned spectral classification of the program and comparison stars .",
    "best achievements result when the two sets of spectra have reasonable signal to noise ratios ( s / n@xmath128 ) , and about the same spectral dispersion and resolution , which is usually not the case .    after a first coarse estimate of spectral type of the program star in question that depends on the more conspicous lines",
    "/ features present ( or absent ) in its spectrum , the normilized spectrogram of the program stars were interpolated between two or more ( normalized ) & similar spectrograms from a library of spectrograms of stars with known mk spectral types taken with a similar resolution , until a reasonable overall match between the program and comparison stars is achieved in temperature and luminosity classes .",
    "we mainly used the jacoby et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and the spmo spectrogram libraries of stars with known mk spectral types to cross correlate them with the program stars until an ( eyeball ) overall best fit of the two was reached .",
    "it is our experience that following this procedure , an uncertainty of one spectral subclass or even less is expected for the brighter stars and about two subclasses for the fainter stars ( e.g. alcal et al .",
    "1996 , chavarra - k et al . 1979 , 2005 , moreno - corral et al .",
    "2002 , 2006 ) . because the later spectral type program stars were almost at the limit of the 84 cm telescope , and the signal to noise ratio of the resulting spectrograms degraded accordingly , an accuracy of 2.5 subclasses in the determination of their spectral class is more realistic .",
    "spectral types of young stars derived this way by us and in common with other authors ( e.g. cohen & kuhi 1979 ; herbig 1977 ; herbig & bell 1988 ) compare well within the above given uncertainties . on the other hand , regarding the determination of luminosity class , the overall s / n ratio of the spectrograms of the program and comparison stars made them unsuitable for a reliable luminosity classification in terms of line ratios or the presence of luminosity sensitive photospheric lines .",
    "an exception are the ( profiles of the ) balmer and strong h - like resonance cai and nai - d lines for early or intermediate and later type stars , respectively . in general , we assumed luminosity class v for the program stars ( given between parenthesis in table  1 ) .",
    "we justify this assumption in terms of the youth of the star members of ldn  1655 and on the results obtained here .",
    "the main sources of error in the distance estimate for the dark cloud ldn  1655 are , in order of importance ,    1 .   the uncertainties in the assigned spectral types of the associated nebulous nj- or r - stars .",

    "typical errors in the _",
    "2mass _ infrared magnitudes of the brighter stars are @xmath129 ( about twice as large for the fainter stars ) and we consider them negligible when compared to other uncertainty sources involved . fortunately , the interstellar extinction law for wavelengths @xmath130 m is practically the same for any sky region involved ( e.g. chavarra - k et al .",
    "1987 , mathis 1990 , and references therein ) , so we can consider it _ universal _ , and its contribution to the distance uncertainty is small .",
    "we expect a final visual magnitude error of the r - stars @xmath131 for stars earlier than f0v and @xmath132 for stars later than k1v when correcting their @xmath89 magnitude for reddening and then fitting them with the appropriate spectral energy distribution to obtain their average unreddened visual magnitude @xmath95 . on the other hand , an uncertainty of ( at the most ) 1.5 subclasses , for an average of the r - stars studied here ( @xmath116 b2 v ) ,",
    "reflects an uncertainty of @xmath133 , and the error of the bolometric corrections with the stellar temperature is @xmath134 .",
    "the above uncertainties add up to an expected error @xmath135 in the distance modulus of a single star ; however , four stars were involved in our distance estimate for the dark cloud , so the final uncertainty would be @xmath136 in its distance modulus , or an uncertainty of @xmath137 kpc for the photometric distance estimate for ldn  1655 of 1.88 kpc derived here , in contrast with the earlier estimates of 1.1 kpc with a formal error bar of @xmath138 kpc .",
    "assuming a distance of 1.1 kpc , except for stars g , iras06548 - 0815 e and h1 , all other stars studied here ( see table  1 ) would be below the zams by 0.28 dex ( @xmath139v@xmath140 ) or more . with @xmath141 kpc",
    ", they fall on or above the zams , giving support to the distance derived here .",
    "the accuracy of the photometric distance estimate given here can be significantly improved if the spectral type of nj065714.1 - 081016 is redetermined , and more r - stars associated with ldn  1655 are observed spectroscopically ( i.e. and the two nebulous stars located at @xmath142 and , respectively .",

    "spectroscopy to confirm the mk spectral type of is recommended .",

    "spectroscopy of the region about @xmath143 south - west of nj065714.1 - 081016 may be rewarding .",
    "considering typical values of @xmath144 and @xmath145 for a given contraction phase towards the main sequence of the young stars classified here , as derived from the observational data ( cohen & kuhi 1979 ) , herbig ae / be stars contract with a helmholtz - kelvin time scale yr . ] @xmath146 yr , ctts are expected to cover their full convective or hayashi evolutionary phase towards the main - sequence in a time scale @xmath147 yr , whereas the less active weak - line t tauri stars ( w(h@xmath148 ) cover their ( radiative or henyey ) evolutionary phase towards the main sequence with a time - scale @xmath149 yr .",
    "low - mass lithium - rich stars are young main sequence stars that still have their primal lithium content ( @xmath150 yr@xmath151 yr ) .",

    "although the age estimates of a significant portion of the project stars are of about the dynamical time scale of the iras06548 - 0815 knot , the evolutionary models predict larger ages fot the rest of them .    nevertheless , given the time - scales in each evolutionary phase for the pre - main sequence and lithium - rich stars , a such admixture of objects constrained in such a small space ( @xmath153 ) ,",
