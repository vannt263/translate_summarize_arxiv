    "in this paper , by a _ differential structure _ we mean a c@xmath1 differential structure for any @xmath2 .",
    "recall , @xcite , that every c@xmath1 structure contains a c@xmath3 structure for any @xmath4 satisfying @xmath5 .",
    "hence we are not concerned about the value of @xmath6 .",
    "it is well - known that euclidean space , @xmath7 , possesses a unique differential structure up to diffeomorphism for @xmath8 but @xmath9 has @xmath10 mutually non - diffeomorphic differential structures ; see @xcite for early details and @xcite for a recent survey .",
    "thus @xmath9 possesses many _ exotic differential structures _ ,",
    "i.e. , differential structures which are not diffeomorphic to the 4-fold product of @xmath11 with the usual structure ( or the 2-fold product of @xmath12 with the usual structure ) . of course",
    "exotic differential structures were discovered more than half a century ago by milnor in @xcite where there is given the first construction of a differential structure on the 7-sphere @xmath13 which is not diffeomorphic to the usual ( product ) differential structure inherited from @xmath14 .",
    "the existence of two mutually non - diffeomorphic differential structures on a manifold is not possible for metrisable manifolds in dimension up to 3 , @xcite : this result is due to rad in dimensions 1 and 2 and moise in dimension 3 .    on the other hand in @xcite it is shown that when we relax the metrisability condition then even in dimension 1 there are @xmath0 mutually non - diffeomorphic differential structures ( on the long ray , hence also the long line @xmath15 ) . as a result",
    "there are also @xmath0 mutually non - diffeomorphic differential structures on the long plane @xmath16 . in this paper",
    "we address the question : does the long plane support differential structures which are not diffeomorphic to any product structure ?",
    "our answer is `` yes . ''    as usual we denote by @xmath17 the set of countable ordinals with the order topology .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the _ closed long ray _",
    ", ie the set @xmath19 with the lexicographic order topology , and let @xmath20 denote the _ long line _ which is obtained from two copies of the closed long ray with their initial points identified to @xmath21 .",
    "the _ ( open ) long ray _ is the 1-manifold @xmath22 .",
    "identify @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "we will exhibit non - product differential structures on @xmath25 . as in @xcite similar structures",
    "may then be deduced on @xmath16 .",
    "the following result is well - known and is found in many books introducing set theory but we include it for completeness .",
    "note that it does not matter whether we are considering @xmath26 and @xmath27 as subsets of @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",

    "choose @xmath36 such that @xmath37 . because @xmath11 has a unique differential structure up to diffeomorphism and @xmath38 is homeomorphic to @xmath11 we may choose a diffeomorphism @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the usual differential structure on @xmath11 restricted to @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore we may assume that @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "next let @xmath44 be a diffeomorphism ( relative to @xmath40 ) such that @xmath45 for all @xmath46 .",

    "then @xmath52 is a closed unbounded set .",
    "[ nice submanifolds ] suppose that @xmath53 is a differential structure on @xmath25 and that @xmath53 is diffeomorphic to the product of two structures .",

    "there are two differential structures , say @xmath56 , on @xmath29 and a diffeomorphism @xmath57 .",
    "interchanging the roles of @xmath32 and @xmath58 if necessary we may assume @xmath50 preserves orientation . by proposition [ lineup ] , @xmath59 is a closed unbounded set .",
    "thus @xmath60 is a differentiable submanifold of @xmath61 for each @xmath62 .",
    "interchanging the coordinates leads to the other half .",
    "we also require the following folklore result , cf ( * ? ? ?",

    "[ extend diffeomorphism ] let @xmath63 be a compact topological manifold with boundary , @xmath64 a compact subset which contains the boundary of @xmath65 and suppose that @xmath66 is a homeomorphism which is a diffeomorphism on a neighbourhood of @xmath67",
    ". then @xmath50 can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a homeomorphism which is a diffeomorphism on @xmath68 and agrees with @xmath50 on a neighbourhood of @xmath67 .",
    "we now present a method of constructing from two differential structures on the long ray a differential structure on @xmath25 which is not diffeomorphic to the product of any two differential structures on @xmath29 .",
    "the construction allows us to verify that there are @xmath0 many non - diffeomorphic such structures .",
    "we require an auxiliary shearing homeomorphism @xmath69 ^ 2\\to[0,5]^2 $ ] .",

    "we modify these maps inductively so that they do agree , at least on enough of @xmath114 . to effect this we construct a sequence of homeomorphisms @xmath115 ^ 2\\to[0,3]^2\\ra$ ] , where @xmath116 .",

    "it is here that we require precision in the approximation of the homeomorphism @xmath126 by the diffeomorphism as required in the last inductive assumption for @xmath118 .",
    "the approximation must improve as @xmath146 increases so that any sequence @xmath147 in @xmath148 converging to @xmath149 $ ] is mapped by @xmath143 ( @xmath150 increasing with @xmath146 ) to a sequence which also converges to @xmath151 .",

    "we now address the question : how many exotic differential structures does @xmath25 support ?",
    "the argument presented in @xcite that @xmath29 supports no more than @xmath0 many mutually non - diffeomorphic differential structures applies as well to @xmath25 . on the other hand ( *",
    "* theorem 5.2 ) exhibits exactly @xmath0 many mutually non - diffeomorphic differential structures on @xmath29 .",
