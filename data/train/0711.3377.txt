    "coherently transferring a quantum state of light to an atomic ensemble enables us to implement quantum memory for photons @xcite , generate a nonclassical state of an atomic ensemble , and manipulate a quantum state of light @xcite .",
    "a coherent transfer can be made by using a phenomenon called electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .",
    "recently , storage and retrieval of nonclassical light and generation of entanglement between two distant atomic ensembles have been demonstrated @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "raman scattered photons generated from atomic ensembles were used as nonclassical light @xcite .",
    "another method of generating nonclassical light , the parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) process , has been widely used in fundamental experiments in quantum optics @xcite and for demonstrating various quantum information protocols @xcite .",
    "light fields produced by the pdc process have been used as rich nonclassical photonic states such as conditional single photon state , antibunched state @xcite , hyperentangled state @xcite ghz state @xcite , @xmath0 state @xcite , and cluster state @xcite , that is , the pdc photon pair is a fundamental resource for creating various nonclassical light fields . storing the pdc photons in atomic ensemble ,",
    "therefore , enables us to store and manipulate various nonclassical lights and can be utilized in the present photonic quantum information processing .",
    "storing nonclassical light generated from the pdc process , however , has a problem in that the bandwidth of the light is not matched by the atomic interaction width @xcite .",
    "the spectral bandwidth of the pdc photons is typically the thz order , whereas the spectral widths for the atomic dipolar transition is the mhz order .",
    "this problem becomes crucial for photon counting , since a photon interacting with atoms can not be selectively counted .",
    "frequency filtering of pdc photons is thus required to solve this problem @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that frequency filtering does not impose fundamental limitations to the current protocols on photonic quantum information , while it does have a disadvantage in that the filtering decreases the photon counting rate .",
    "the storage of pdc photons has been demonstrated by using time - filtering in our previous study @xcite .",
    "however , the nonclassicality of the incident and the retrieved lights was not confirmed in the study .",
    "furthermore , there was a large difference of frequency bandwidth between the incident and the retrieved lights .    in this paper , we demonstrated storage and retrieval of pdc photons , where we avoided the problem on the bandwidth mismatch between pdc photons and eit spectral width by using frequency filtering technique .",
    "preservation of nonclassicality of the retrieved pdc photons was confirmed by using the photon counting method , where we introduced an inequality which is only satisfied for classical light fields . the pdc photons exhibit pair correlation , since a single pump photon is converted to two photons .",
    "this pair correlation is essential for preparing single photons conditionally .",
    "therefore , we also checked preservation of the single photon property through the storage process by using triggered pdc photons .",
    "in our experiment , we used single - mode pdc photons ( degenerate parametric fluorescence ) because of the experimental simplicity of the frequency filtering .",
    "there are several methods for estimating the nonclassicality of the single - mode pdc photons @xcite . especially in ref @xcite , nonclassical photon statistics has been successfully observed by using photon counting .",
    "this method , however , can not be applied to our experiment because of the low overall photon detection efficiency which is caused by frequency filtering , eit , and photon counters .",
    "we thus introduce a different type of inequality here . when the glauber s p function @xcite @xmath1 is non - negative , the following inequality is obtained .    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is any real number .",
    "left part can be expanded in series on @xmath3 . to satisfy the inequality for any @xmath3",
    ", the discriminant should be negative and the following inequality is obtained .",
    "@xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the annihilation and creation operators of the single - mode light .",
    "the violation of this inequality ( 2 ) means that the non - negative p function does not exist , that is , the light is nonclassical .    in our experiment",
    ", we also prepared single photon state by using the single - mode pdc photons .",
    "the single photon property can be estimated from the anticorrelation parameter @xcite .",
    "@xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the annihilation ( creation ) operators of the signal and trigger photons , respectively .",
    "the anticorrelation parameter @xmath10 corresponds to conditionally estimated intensity correlation function . in this sense , when @xmath10 is less than 1",
    ", the resultant signal light is a nonclassical field .",
    "especially , when @xmath10 is close to 0 , the resultant signal light can be regarded as the conditional single photon state .",
    "when the single - mode parametric fluorescence with low excitation is split into two beams ( trigger and signal beams ) and one photon is detected at the trigger beam , the resultant signal light can also be regarded as the conditional single photon state .",

    "optical pulse ( full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the pulse temporal width = 50 ns ) were generated by an acousto - optic modulator ( aom1 ) from the linearly polarized continuous output of a ti : sapphire laser ( tis1 ) tuned to the @xmath24 transition .",
    "the pulses were coupled to ln1 with 60% efficiency and generated second harmonic pulses , the polarizations of which were the same as the fundamental light .",
    "the second harmonic light were separated from the fundamental light by using a pellin broca prism ( pbp ) and a dichroic mirror ( dm ) .",

    "the total transmittance of the frequency filtering at the center frequency of the pdc light ( resonant on @xmath24 transition ) was about 20% .    in order to achieve the long term stability of the frequency filtering , we utilized both the locking and the alignment beams ( not shown in fig.1 ) .",
    "a part of the output beam from tis1 ( locking beam ) was phase modulated by an electro - optic modulator and its frequency was adequately shifted by an acousto - optic modulator .",
    "the locking beam was incident on fc and the resonant frequency of fc was actively stabilized to @xmath25 transition by using a piezo electric transducer attached to the cavity mirror , where conventional fm - sideband locking technique was utilized and the fluctuation of the resonant frequency was suppressed less than 1 mhz . in order to prevent the locking beam being mixed to the pdc light , the beams were in opposite circulations of the cavity .",
    "a fraction of the laser beam diffracted by the aom1 was tapped by a beam splitter and was used as the alignment beam .",

    "the resonant frequency of the et was tuned to @xmath25 transition by monitoring the transmittance of the alignment beam and adjusting the temperature of the et .",
    "once the proper resonance was obtained , it was stable for one day and the alignment beam was thus cut off when the data was acquired for the pdc light .",

    "it should be noted that the spectrum of the frequency - filtered pdc photons is not gaussian but close to lorentzian , since the probe pdc pulse passed through the filtering cavity ( fc ) .",

    "this result suggests that the atomic ensemble storing the photonic information was in a nonclassical state .",
    "we also prepared the conditional single photons by using the pdc photons and performed the storage and retrieval of the single photons .",
