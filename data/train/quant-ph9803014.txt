    "in this paper we are concerned with quantum fields in _ open _ cavities  the obvious example of ultimate interest would be electromagnetic fields in optical cavities @xcite and the associated problem of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) .",
    "such systems are open because energy leaks to the outside ( e.g. , via output coupling ) , and as dissipative systems can not normally be quantized on their own @xcite ; rather , one must also consider the bath into which energy escapes , so that the total universe is conservative .",
    "thus such cavities , say of linear dimension @xmath0 , can be embedded in a universe of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "one can then quantize on the modes of the universe , which are labeled by a wavenumber @xmath2 spaced by @xmath3 .",
    "the field quanta are then created or destroyed by operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and higher - order processes involve integrals @xmath6 .",
    "on the other hand , these cavities often have a very small amount of leakage , characterized by a parameter @xmath7 , where the quality factor of the cavity can be as high as @xmath8 or more .",
    "if this is the case , the intuition developed from a _ closed _ cavity , also of length @xmath0 , should be relevant .",
    "a closed cavity is a conservative system , with normal modes ( nms ) labeled by a _",
    "index @xmath9 , where the wavenumber is @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "field quanta in such a closed cavity are created and destroyed by operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and higher - order processes involve discrete sums @xmath14 .",
    "can quantum fields in an _ open _ cavity be described in a similar way  in terms of discrete modes and the corresponding operators ? if this is possible , computations will be simplified and will correspond to physical intuition , with each term @xmath15 associated with a cavity  mode \" .",
    "the connection with the limit of a closed cavity ( @xmath16 ) would also become manifest .",
    "quantization of a closed system relies on its nms ; the counterparts in an open system are the quasinormal modes ( qnms ) , which are again factorized solutions    @xmath17    where @xmath18 because of the loss of energy .",
    "each qnm corresponds to a resonance , with a width @xmath19 .",
    "the purpose of this paper , in short , is to develop a formalism whereby field quantization can be implemented in terms of these qnms , and to define and study operators @xmath12 , @xmath20 for these modes .",
    "specifically , one wishes to express field correlation functions , feynman propagators and other quantities in terms of the qnms .",
    "the dissipative nature of the system is then contained in the qnms themselves .    the advantages for cqed would be obvious . the simplest phenomenon to which such a formalism can apply is the well - known enhancement ( or suppression ) of spontaneous decay rates when the emitted radiation falls on ( or between ) resonances @xcite .",
    "resonance domination of these processes has been discussed starting with the heuristic argument due to purcell  @xcite .",
    "he proposed that the fermi golden rule should be generalized : the density of states per unit volume , instead of the usual @xmath21 for vacuum ( where @xmath22 is the velocity of light ) , is to be replaced by @xmath23 for a @xmath24-fold degenerate qnm of width @xmath25 in a cavity of volume @xmath26 .",
    "this leads to an enhancement factor of @xmath27 for spontaneous emission on resonance , where @xmath28 is the wavelength of light emitted and @xmath29 is the quality factor of the cavity .",
    "the essence of this argument is that each resonance counts as one state , i.e. , in a suitable sense it carries unit weight . while intuitively plausible , this statement is difficult to justify formally  since the entire concept of a state , i.e. , an nm , falls apart in an open system .",
    "however , this argument , and its many variants and extensions , would find natural expression in a framework that quantizes on the qnms , and we shall in particular show explicitly below that each resonance carries unit weight .    in section [ class ] , the qnm expansion of _ classical _ fields outgoing from a cavity is reviewed .",
    "the classical results may be organized into two levels .",
    "first , under conditions to be specified , the green s function @xmath30 can be expanded in terms of qnms .",
    "second , one can try to expand the outgoing classical fields @xmath31 in terms of qnms , and to establish a linear space structure similar to that for conservative systems . in order to do so",
    ", it turns out to be necessary to make use of a two - component formalism , dealing with @xmath31 and the conjugate momentum @xmath32 at the same time .",
    "the linear space formalism is more elegant , but in its simplest form is limited to only 1 d.    the quantum formalism can likewise be approached in two ways . in the first , which we shall call the green s function method ( section [ 1comp ] ) , one focuses on @xmath22-number correlation functions and propagators without explicitly expanding the field operator @xmath31 in terms of qnms .",
    "the key idea is that the retarded propagator @xmath33 of the quantum theory is exactly the same as the classical green s function @xmath30 , and the latter has a qnm expansion .",
    "once @xmath33 is obtained , it is straightforward to derive a qnm expansion for the correlation function @xmath34 as well .    in the second , which we shall call the field expansion method , one tries to establish an expansion of the quantum field @xmath31 , in parallel with the linear space structure established for classical fields",
    "this allows us to interpret the expansion coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 , roughly speaking , as generalized creation and annihilation operators for the discrete qnms @xmath15 .",
    "however , before doing so , it has to be recognized that quantum fields can not be constrained by the outgoing wave condition  for the simple reason that zero - point ( and thermal ) fluctuations must contain an incoming component .",
    "thus , the first step in developing this method , presented in section [ incoming ] , is to generalize the field expansion to handle _ incoming _ waves as well . with this generalization",
    ", one can then subject the fields to canonical quantization in section [ quant ] .",
    "this is done by starting with the universe , a closed hermitian system for which the quantization is unambiguously defined .",
    "then , in parallel with the usual removal of bath oscillators @xcite , the outside degrees of freedom are eliminated from the equations of motion  @xcite",
    ". the results will be equations of motion and commutation relations for the _ discrete _ operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 , in which the effects of the outside bath are clearly displayed : the loss of energy of each mode by leakage , and the pumping of each mode by the thermal or quantum fluctuations from the outside .",
    "the formalism is then used to evaluate the correlation function @xmath34 in section [ correl ] , and the results are compared with those obtained from the green s function method .",
    "interestingly , the results appear to be different  those derived from the green s function method contain a single sum @xmath35 over the qnms , while the field expansion method yields a double sum @xmath36 with off - diagonal terms .",
    "the two are , however , shown to be equal through an identity on @xmath33 . recalling that the expansion of the classical field is unique only when the second component  @xmath32 is considered at the same time , we next show that the expansion of the correlation function @xmath34 is also unique if we consider @xmath32 as well , giving the non - diagonal form .",
    "the density of states  @xmath37 , which is intimately related to the correlation function , is also expressed in terms of qnms ; in particular it is shown that up to corrections of @xmath38 , each resonance carries unit weight in the density of states .",
    "the results on the correlation function are then used , in section [ feyn ] , to evaluate and discuss the feynman propagator @xmath39 , which is the fundamental building block for cqed . again , equivalent diagonal and non - diagonal forms are obtained .",
    "particular attention is paid to the equal space propagator @xmath40 , whose imaginary part is related to the life - time of an excited atom placed at @xmath41 .",
    "this quantity is discussed in the approximation of domination by a single resonance , providing justification for purcell s heuristic argument @xcite on the enhancement of spontaneous decay rates . the advantage of using the non - diagonal expression is again emphasized .    in section [ example ] ,",
    "a very simple example is studied explicitly , and its correlation function and energy density are expressed in terms of a sum over qnm contributions .",
    "some final remarks are then given in section [ remarks ] .",
    "we stress that this paper is concerned entirely with _ free _ fields , either as a model of the free electromagnetic field in an optical cavity , or as the zeroth - order building blocks in an interacting theory , e.g. , the propagators as ingredients in higher - order feynman diagrams .",
    "the development of the interacting theory and its application to cqed phenomena will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a partial account of the present theory has been given in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we summarize the qnm expansion for classical fields . in this paper",
    ", we deal with scalar fields in 1 d only .    for closed ,",
    "linear systems , eigenfunction expansions , based on the eigenfunctions or nms of their evolution operators , are a tool of vital importance in theoretical physics",
    ". however , open systems are not directly amenable to an nm analysis .",
    "examples of open systems include optical cavities @xcite , and finite regions of space near astrophysical objects , from which gravitational waves can escape @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "any initial state decays in time , so stationary nms do not exist . as the simplest example , we shall be concerned with the scalar wave equation in one space dimension ,    @xmath42    studied in a  cavity \" @xmath43 , with the nodal boundary condition    @xmath44    at one end but with the outgoing one    @xmath45    at the other .",
    "the latter condition states that , just outside the cavity boundary , the field @xmath46 is an outgoing wave @xmath47 ; the condition is specified at @xmath48 because , as we shall see below , one is often concerned with models in which there is a singularity in @xmath49 at @xmath50 , leading to possible discontinuities in @xmath51 or @xmath52 . the boundary condition ( [ bc - right ] ) turns the cavity into a dissipative system that is leaky but not absorptive . the model ( [ wave - eq ] )",
    "has been widely used as the scalar model of electromagnetism in an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "more physically , the 1-d nature is realized in fabry - perot cavities with lengths much smaller than the lateral dimensions , and the scalar field model is rigorously applicable to the transverse electric sector .    for the system ( [ wave - eq])([bc - right ] )",
    ", the eigensolutions , labeled by an index @xmath15 , have the form ( [ eigensol ] ) , with the qnms or cavity resonances @xmath53 satisfying    @xmath54 \\mskip0.5\\thinmuskip f_j = 0 \\label{def - qnm}\\ ] ]    and the boundary conditions ( [ bc - left ] ) , ( [ bc - right ] ) translating to    @xmath55    it is easily verified that @xmath56 , so that the solution ( [ eigensol ] ) is indeed decaying in time .",
    "furthermore , the frequencies @xmath57 , which we suppose to be ordered according to increasing real parts , are spaced by @xmath58 , approximately as for a conservative system of size @xmath0 . with the possible exception of modes with @xmath59",
    ", the qnms always occur in pairs with @xmath60 , and one can choose @xmath61 .",
    "the usual formalism concerning eigenfunction expansions relies on the hermiticity of the evolution operator , which only holds in the conservative case , and therefore breaks down for open systems .",
    "one possible resolution is to embed the cavity into a  universe \" @xmath62 with a nodal condition at @xmath63 , and study its nms  the modes of the universe .",
    "namely , the system ( [ wave - eq])([bc - right ] ) is the restriction to @xmath64 of the problem ( [ wave - eq ] ) on the half line",
    "@xmath65 , if one sets    @xmath66    and with the extension of the initial conditions to the  outside \" @xmath67 obeying @xmath68",
    ". however , this has the obvious disadvantage of having to work with a continuum of states ( spaced by @xmath69 ) as opposed to the discrete set of eigenfunctions in the conservative case . besides , the closed system of equations ( [ wave - eq])([bc - right ] ) shows that even in the presence of dissipation the time evolution of the cavity can be studied _ without _ explicit reference to the outside , which is the principal goal of the program of second quantization of the open system .",
    "previous work ( see @xcite and references therein ) has established that , in spite of the lack of hermiticity in the conventional sense , an eigenfunction expansion for outgoing waves in classical open wave systems can be formulated in terms of the cavity degrees of freedom only , overcoming the disadvantages of the modes of the universe approach . the sufficient conditions for this qnm expansion are as follows .    * the function @xmath49 has at least a step discontinuity at @xmath50 .",
    "this demarcates a well - defined cavity region . *",
    "the function @xmath49 has no tail outside the cavity , i.e. , @xmath70 .",
    "this condition ensures that the outside does not reflect outgoing waves back into the cavity , enabling the complete elimination of the environment from the equations of motion .",
    "these conditions are satisfied for optical cavities bounded from extended vacuum by a sharp material interface .",
    "the completeness of the qnms can be pursued at two levels .",
    "first , one shows that the retarded green s function of the system has the representation    @xmath71    for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where the @xmath53 s are normalized according to ( [ normal ] ) below .",
    "thus , the dynamics is contained entirely in the qnms , leading to a simple method of obtaining the retarded propagators and quantum correlation functions , as sketched in section [ 1comp ] .",
    "second , realizing that the wave equation ( [ wave - eq ] ) , like any classical hamiltonian problem , requires both position and momentum to be specified as initial data , one introduces function _ pairs _",
    "@xmath74 with the conjugate momentum @xmath75 , so that for eigenfunctions @xmath76 .",
    "the space of all function pairs satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ bc - left ] ) and  ( [ bc - right ] ) will be denoted as @xmath77  the space of outgoing waves .    using these pairs",
    ", one can prove that the time evolution generated by ( [ greenfie ] ) can be recast in the form @xcite",
    "@xmath78    where the expansion coefficients are given by    @xmath79    with @xmath80 and the _ bilinear scalar product _    @xmath81    + \\phi(a^+)\\mskip0.5\\thinmuskip\\chi(a^+ ) \\right\\ } \\;. \\label{scalarprod}\\ ] ]    by simply letting @xmath82 in ( [ evolve ] ) one arrives at a _ two - component expansion _ for an arbitrary @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "this expansion makes the completeness of the qnms manifest .",
    "the normalization used in ( [ greenfie ] ) to ( [ a_n1 ] ) can be concisely expressed as    @xmath84    it is seen that ( [ normal ] ) in general is not real , underlining the difference between the product ( [ scalarprod ] ) and a conventional one involving complex conjugation . the fact that ( [ normal ] ) is bilinear also serves to establish a phase convention for the wavefunctions .    upon introducing the two - component evolution operator    @xmath85    the cavity evolution ( [ wave - eq ] ) can be written as @xmath86 , in striking analogy with quantum mechanics . in this notation ,",
    "the definition ( [ def - qnm ] ) of @xmath53 takes the form @xmath87 .",
    "the operator @xmath88 can be shown to be symmetric with respect to the form ( [ scalarprod ] ) , i.e. ,    @xmath89    for any @xmath90 .",
    "this analog of hermiticity holds even though the system is not conservative .",
    "the symmetry of @xmath88 yields the orthogonality relation    @xmath91    in an immediate transcription of the usual proof , leading to the uniqueness of the expansion .",
    "incidentally , an expansion such as ( [ evolve ] ) but involving the first component alone would not be unique .",
    "it is appropriate to contrast the two methods of approaching the classical theory , since they respectively underpin the two methods for dealing with the quantum case .",
    "the expansion of the green s function is easy to derive , and is readily generalized to higher dimensions ; however , in itself it does not lead to a _",
    "unique _ expansion of the field , nor to concepts of orthogonality .",
    "the two - component approach based on ( [ evolve ] ) is more elegant , exhibits a deeper resemblance to conservative systems , and most importantly leads to a _",
    "unique _ expansion in terms of orthogonal functions .",
    "the two - component expansion can in principle be generalized to higher dimensions by treating each angular momentum sector @xmath92 as a 1-d radial problem  @xcite , but the degree of complexity increases with @xmath92 .",

    "this relationship between @xmath33 and @xmath30 follows from the commutation relation ( [ ccr ] ) .    in terms of @xmath33 , it is straightforward to compute the equilibrium correlation function    @xmath102    we shall devote attention to @xmath34 , because the physical quantities of interest in quantum field theory can often be formulated in terms of correlation functions , at either zero or finite temperatures .",
    "for example , the casimir force is merely the vacuum expectation value of the electromagnetic stress tensor , which is an equal - time equal - space correlation function of two field operators",
    ". the spontaneous decay rate of an atom in an excited state is , in the golden rule approximation , related to the correlation function of two electric field operators .",
    "since the correlation function is related to the retarded propagator @xcite , one gets    @xmath103    the real - time correlator can be obtained from ( [ f - d ] ) by contour integration , yielding    @xmath104\\;. \\label{f - realt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first term in this formula is due to the qnm poles in @xmath105 ; the second term , which has no counterpart in @xmath101 , is caused by the matsubara poles in @xmath105 at frequencies @xmath106 .",

    "there are of course many ways to understand why the correlator is non - diagonal ; one of the most direct is via ( [ eqom - a_n ] ) , which shows that all the mode coefficients @xmath13 are driven by the same force @xmath139 , so in general different coefficients will have phase coherence and hence a nonzero correlation .",
    "incidentally , this non - diagonal nature is _ not _ a quantum effect , since the property survives at high temperatures , e.g. , @xmath230 in ( [ ff - corr ] ) .",
    "however , all the propagators and correlation functions become diagonal in the conservative limit , as they should . in fact , applying ( [ ortho ] ) to ( [ a_n - a_m ] ) in this limit readily yields    @xmath231    in agreement with the creation ",

    "<S> the second - quantization of a scalar field in an open cavity is formulated , from first principles , in terms of the quasinormal modes ( qnms ) , which are the eigensolutions of the evolution equation that decay exponentially in time as energy leaks to the outside . </S>",
