    "the concept of holography has proven to be enormously fruitful for demonstrating interesting new connections between disparate areas of physics .",
    "the basic idea is that gravitational dynamics in a given dimensionality can be mapped onto some other ( non - gravitational ) field theory of a lower dimensionality .",
    "holography has been most thoroughly explored in the context of the ads / cft correspondence conjecture , in which a large volume of calculational evidence indicates that a ( relativistic ) conformal field theory ( cft ) can be mapped to gravitational dynamics in an asymptotically anti de sitter ( ads ) spacetime of one larger dimension @xcite .    over the past few years",
    "it has become clear that holographic concepts cover a much broader conceptual territory .",
    "for example holographic renormalization has been shown to be a useful tool for understanding conserved quantities and gravitational thermodynamics in both asymptotically de sitter @xcite and asymptotically flat spacetimes @xcite .",
    "much more recently holography has been extended to describe a duality between a broad range of strongly coupled field theories and gravity in the context of qcd quark - gluon plasmas @xcite , atomic physics , and condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "gravity - gauge duality is evidently a robust concept , and its full implications for physics ( for example in elucidating the strong coupling behaviour of the non - gravitational theories noted above ) remain to be understood",
    ". one line of investigation has been concerned with lifshitz field theories , which have an anisotropic scaling of the form @xmath0 exhibited by fixed points governing the behaviour of various condensed matter systems .",
    "such scaling offers some promise for further extending holographic duality between condensed matter physics and gravity . while for @xmath1",
    "this scaling symmetry is the familiar conformal symmetry , for @xmath2 , theories with this type of scaling are power - counting renormalizable , possibly providing a uv completion to the effective gravitational field theory @xcite . for lifshitz gravity , the natural asymptotic spacetime metric is @xmath3 noted earlier in a braneworld context @xcite .",
    "a @xmath4-dimensional anisotropic scale invariant background using an action that couples gravity to a massive gauge field ( or alternatively to 2-form and dualized @xmath5-form field strengths with a chern - simons coupling ) can be constructed that has solutions with the asymptotic behaviour ( [ lifmet ] ) @xcite .",
    "an early example @xcite for an extended class of vacuum solutions for a sort of higher - dimensional dilaton gravity with general @xmath6 was soon followed by the discovery of black hole solutions , both exact ( for @xmath7 ) @xcite and numerical ( for more general values of @xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "since in general one expects quantum - gravitational effects to induce corrections to the einstein action , it is natural to consider modifying the gravitational part of the action with higher - derivative terms due to additional powers of the curvature .",
    "such terms must be considered on the gravity side of the duality conjecture in order to study cfts with different values for their central charges . here",
    ", lovelock gravity theories play a special role in that the number of metric derivatives in any field equation is never larger than 2 . furthermore , third - order lovelock gravity is supersymmetric , and therefore one can define superconformal field theories via the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "the addition to the action of a term cubic in curvature is not new , but asymptotic lifshitz solutions in lovelock gravity coupled to a massive abelian gauge field were only recently discovered @xcite . for",
    "a suitable choice of coupling constant one can dispense with this massive gauge field , since the additional lovelock terms can play the role of the desired matter .",
    "some new exact black hole solutions were obtained as well as a broad class of numerical solutions , and asymptotic lifshitz solutions with curvature - squared terms in the action have also been investigated @xcite . somewhat remarkably , the relationship between the energy density , temperature , and entropy density is unchanged from einsteinian gravity @xcite even though the sub - leading large-@xmath8 behaviour of lovelock - lifshitz black branes differs substantively from their einsteinian lifshitz counterparts @xcite .",
    "the relationship between entropy and temperature is also the same as the einsteinian case , apart from a constant of integration that depends on the lovelock coefficients .",
    "the hallmark feature of lovelock theories is that no field equation has more than two derivatives of any metric coefficient .",
    "however , a new cubic curvature term was recently introduced that can perhaps be regarded as a generalization of lovelock gravity in five dimensions @xcite .",
    "the generality arises from a spherical symmetry requirement : the field equations will generally reduce to second - order system of differential equations when the metric is spherically symmetric .",
    "this particular class of correction terms has been coined quasi - topological gravity , since in some ways they behave like topological invariants in 6 dimensions , yet for nonspherical geometries , they contribute nontrivially to the action . furthermore , there are no lagrangians that are cubic in curvature in four dimensions for spherical symmetry that lead to second order differential equations .",
    "quasi - topological gravity has been previously studied in the case of planar ads black holes . in this paper",
    "we investigate the implications of this new term for asymptotically lifshitz spacetimes .    specifically , we examine the effects of higher - curvature modifications to einsteinian gravity to asymptotically lifshitz metrics , both with and without massive background abelian gauge fields .",
    "we find that quasi - topological lifshitz gravity replicates the field equations from third - order lovelock - lifshitz gravity @xcite , provided the quasi - topological parameter @xmath9 is appropriately renormalized .",
    "we find that indeed , asymptotic lifshitz black holes exist in both cases .",
    "we obtain both exact solutions and numerical ones , the latter obtained via the shooting method .",
    "we close with a short discussion of the relevant thermodynamics and conserved quantities of our black hole solutions .",

    "<S> we investigate the effects of including a quasi - topological cubic curvature term to the gauss - bonnet action to five dimensional lifshitz gravity . we find that a new set of lifshitz black hole solutions exist that are analogous to those obtained in third - order lovelock gravity in higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> no additional matter fields are required to obtain solutions with asymptotic lifshitz behaviour , though we also investigate solutions with matter . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we examine black hole solutions and their thermodynamics in this situation and find that a negative quasi - topological term , just like a positive gauss - bonnet term , prevents instabilities in what are ordinarily unstable einsteinian black holes . </S>"
