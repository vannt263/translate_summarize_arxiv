    "<S> we demonstrate the emergence of luttinger liquid physics at low energies for a variety of static correlation functions as well as for thermodynamic properties . the characteristic power law suppression of the momentum distribution @xmath1 function at @xmath2 can be directly observed over several orders of magnitude . at finite temperature </S>",
    "<S> , we show that @xmath1 obeys a scaling relation . </S>",
    "<S> the luttinger liquid parameter and the renormalized fermi velocity can be extracted from the density response function , the specific heat , and/or the susceptibility without the need to carry out any finite - size analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate that the energy scale below which luttinger liquid power laws manifest vanishes as the half - filled system is driven into a gapped phase by large interactions . </S>"
