    "in the impulsive phase of a solar flare , precipitations of nonthermal electrons from the corona generate radiation from denser layers , such as the transition region and/or the upper chromosphere .",
    "this radiation is often observed in hard x - rays ( hxrs ) or microwaves .",
    "precipitations of nonthermal electrons also cause radiation sources in h@xmath0 because of rapid thermalization or other mechanisms . therefore , h@xmath0 kernels and hxr sources show a high correlation in their locations and light curves @xcite .",
    "however , the difference between the spatial distributions of h@xmath0 kernels and hxr sources is also well known .",
    "h@xmath0 images sometimes show elongated brightenings , called h@xmath0 flare ribbons , with many h@xmath0 kernels within them .",
    "the size of elemental h@xmath0 kernels is considered to be about @xmath1 or even smaller @xcite , which is larger than the spatial resolution achieved with h@xmath0 instruments ( @xmath2 ) but is smaller than that with hxr instruments of about @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "hxr images show very few sources , sometimes only one .",
    "hxr sources are accompanied by h@xmath0 kernels in many cases , but many h@xmath0 kernels are not accompanied by hxr sources . the only exception to this `` lack of radiation sources in hxrs '' that is known , is the bastille day event on 2000 july 14 @xcite .",
    "this event shows a clear two - ribbon structure in hxrs such as in h@xmath0 .",
    "this difference of spatial distributions may be explained by the difference in radiation mechanisms between hxrs and h@xmath0 .",
    "the hxr intensity is proportional to the number of accelerated electrons , and is thought to be proportional to the energy release rate @xcite .",
    "therefore , only compact regions where the largest energy release occurred are observable as hxr sources . on the other hand ,",
    "the mechanisms for h@xmath0 radiation are much more complicated than those for hxr radiation , and to derive the effect of electrons is quite difficult @xcite .",
    "some weaker h@xmath0 kernels may be caused by a secondary effect of precipitation or thermal conduction .",
    "however , as we mentioned above , the light curve of each h@xmath0 kernel has a high correlation with that of the total hxr intensity , even if their intensity is not so strong and they do not have an hxr counterpart .",
    "we suggest that the difference between the spatial distributions of h@xmath0 kernels and hxr sources is caused by the low dynamic range of the hxr data . in the hxr images only the strongest sources are seen , and the weaker sources are buried in the noise .",
    "we use the hxr data taken with the hard x - ray telescope ( hxt ; kosugi et al .",
    "1991 ) onboard _ yohkoh _ ( ogawara et al . 1991 ) in this paper .",
    "the dynamic range of the hxt images is about 10 .",
    "therefore , if the released energy at the h@xmath0 kernels associated _ with _ hxr sources is at least 10 times larger than that at the h@xmath0 kernels _ without _ hxr sources , then the difference of appearance can be explained .    in this paper , we measured the photospheric magnetic field strengths at each radiation source seen in h@xmath0 images which have much higher spatial resolution than hxr images .",
    "we also estimated the energy release rates based on the magnetic reconnection model @xcite at each radiation source .",
    "then we compared the energy release rates with the spatial distribution of radiation sources in an hxr image since they suggest the site where the strong energy release occurred . to examine the difference of the amount of the released magnetic energy",
    ", we measured the photospheric magnetic field strengths at each radiation source . in ",
    "2 we summarize the observational data and the results . in ",
    "3 we discuss the amount of energy release at each radiation source . in ",
    "4 the summary and the conclusion are given .",
    "we observed a large two - ribbon flare ( x2.3 on the goes scale ) which occurred in the noaa active region 9415 ( s22@xmath4 , w01@xmath4 ) at 05:10 ut , 2001 april 10 with the sartorius refractor telescope ( _ sartorius _ ) at kwasan observatory , kyoto university .",
    "the highest temporal and spatial resolutions of the _ sartorius _ data are 1 s and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the details of the flare were reported in several papers @xcite . to compare the locations of the hxr radiation sources with those of the h@xmath0 kernels",
    ", we used the hxr data taken with hxt , whose temporal and spatial resolutions are 0.5 s and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we also used a magnetogram obtained at 05:18 ut with the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ; scherrer et al .",
    "1995 ) onboard the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _",
    "( _ soho _ ; domingo , fleck , and poland 1995 ) to measure photospheric magnetic field strengths .",
    "the spatial resolution of the mdi image is about @xmath6 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the images of the flare at 05:19 ut in h@xmath0 and hxr .",
    "we overlaid the hxr contour image on the h@xmath0 image ( in panel b of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , to compare the spatial distribution of radiation sources in these two wavelengths .",
    "there are many h@xmath0 kernels inside the flare ribbons . in panel",
    "a of figure 1 we can identify ten h@xmath0 kernels by eyes , which are numbered from e1 to e6 and from w1 to w4 . here , `` e '' and `` w '' , mean the eastern and the western flare ribbons , respectively .    on the other hand , the hxr image ( panel b in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) shows only two sources even at the contour level of 10% of the peak intensity .",
    "these hxr sources are associated with the h@xmath0 kernels e2 and w2 .",
    "we confirmed that those h@xmath0 kernels , e2 and w2 , are conjugate footpoints in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "the soft x - ray images of the flares taken with the soft x - ray telescope onboard _",
    "yohkoh _ also show the flare loops which connect e2 and w2 .",
    "such differences between the spatial distributions of the h@xmath0 kernels and the hxr sources may be caused by the differences in energy release rates at each radiation source .",
    "we measured the magnetic field strengths at each h@xmath0 kernel , both with and without hxr sources , and estimated their energy release rates .",
    "then we compared these rates with the spatial distribution of the hxr sources .",
    "the estimation is discussed in the next section . here",
    ", we examine the relation between the photospheric magnetic field strength and the radiation sources .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the h@xmath0 image in which the flare ribbons are clearly seen ( _ left _ panel ) , and the photospheric magnetogram of the same region obtained with mdi ( _ right _ panel ) .",
    "the outer edges of the h@xmath0 flare ribbons are plotted by cross signs in both the panels of figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the magnetic reconnection model indicates that the newest energy release occurs on the outermost flare loops , and the h@xmath0 kernels and hxr sources appear at the footpoints of the flare loops , say , at the fronts of the h@xmath0 flare ribbons .",
    "therefore , we measured the photospheric magnetic field strengths along the outer edges of the flare ribbons .",
    "the source e4 is excluded from the discussion , because it is not located on the ribbon - front .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the photospheric magnetic field strengths along the outer edges of both the h@xmath0 flare ribbons .",
    "the _ left gray _",
    "plot shows the magnetic strengths for the east ribbon with positive magnetic polarity , and the _ right black _ plot is for the west ribbon with negative magnetic polarity .",
    "the magnetic field strengths at the h@xmath0 kernels are higher than in the other non - kernel regions , 300 g on average , and those at the hxr sources ( e2 and w2 ) are especially high ( @xmath7 1000 g ) .",
    "we summarize the magnetic field strengths at each h@xmath0 kernel in table 1 .",
    "the photospheric magnetic field strengths of the h@xmath0 kernels accompanied by hxr sources are about 3 times larger than the other h@xmath0 kernels .",
    "in this section , we examine the energy release rates in the flare ribbons , and discuss the relation between the rates and the spatial distribution of the h@xmath0 kernels and hxr sources .",
    "we assume that the hxr intensity observed with the hxt is proportional to the energy release rate @xmath8 due to magnetic reconnection .",
    "the energy release rate is written as the product of the poynting flux into the reconnection region @xmath9 and the area of the reconnection region @xmath10 @xcite as follows ; @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the magnetic field strength in the corona and @xmath13 is the inflow velocity into the reconnection region . for simplicity , we assume that the area of the reconnection region does not change much during the flare and is independent of the magnetic field strength .",
    "therefore , the energy release rate is simply written as @xmath14 . here , we use magnetic field strengths at the the photosphere @xmath15 instead of those at the corona @xmath12 to estimate the energy release rates , since to measure @xmath12 directly is difficult .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 is proportional to @xmath15 in the same ratio all over the flaring region .",
    "if this assumption is true , the differences of the energy release rates estimated with @xmath15 are the same as those with @xmath12 . from now on ,",
    "we estimate the energy release rate by using the photospheric magnetic field strength , and we write it simply as @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath13 has no dependence on @xmath16 , the energy release rate is directly proportional to the square of the magnetic field strength , @xmath17 .",
    "since the h@xmath0 kernels accompanied by hxr radiation have magnetic field strengths about 3 times larger than those without the hxr radiation , the energy release rates at the former are about 9 times larger than those at the latter .",
    "the difference in the energy release rates is just comparable to the dynamic range of the hxt ( @xmath7 10 ) , but is not enough for weaker radiation sources to be buried in noise . at other h@xmath0 kernels ,",
    "hxr sources should be observed .",
    "therefore , under this assumption the spatial distribution of radiation sources can not be explained .",
    "this result suggests that @xmath13 may have some dependence on @xmath16 as some authors have suggested . @xcite and",
    "@xcite give the relation @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the magnetic reynolds number , and @xmath20 is the alfvn velocity .",
    "here , @xmath20 is expressed as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the mass density .",
    "@xmath19 is defined as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the characteristic length of the flare region and the magnetic diffusivity , respectively .",
    "therefore , we can derive the relation @xmath26 , and then @xmath27 .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite suggests that @xmath13 hardly depends on @xmath19 , and indicates @xmath28 .",
    "hence , we can derive the relation @xmath29 .",
    "since @xmath16 at the hxr sources is 3 times larger , these two models of magnetic recconection predict that the energy release is 16 and 27 times stronger for the h@xmath0 sources accompanied by hxr sources than for the other h@xmath0 kernels , respectively .",
    "this is sufficiently larger than the dynamic range of hxt , and the difference between the spatial distributions can be explained .",
    "we have examined the difference between the spatial distributions of h@xmath0 kernels and hxr sources .",
    "the hxr sources indicate where large energy release has occurred , while the h@xmath0 kernels show the precipitation sites of nonthermal electrons with higher spatial resolution .",
    "we measured the photospheric magnetic field strength at each h@xmath0 kernel , and found that the magnetic field strengths at the h@xmath0 kernels accompanied by hxr sources are about 3 times higher than those at the other h@xmath0 kernels ( without any hxr sources ) .",
    "we also estimated their energy release rates , by using the photospheric magnetic field strengths and by considering the dependence of @xmath30 on @xmath16 as derived by some authors ( e.g. sweet 1958 ; parker 1957 ; petschek 1964 ) .",
    "the estimated energy release rates at the hxr sources are large enough to explain the difference of appearance of the h@xmath0 and hxr images .",
    "the gap in our understanding of large scale structure such as h@xmath0 flare ribbons and compact radiation sources has been well known not only in hxrs , but also in microwaves . even in sxrs",
    ", flare loops often appear only in a part of the whole flaring region and/or seem to connect only a few radiation sources .",
    "the lack of radiation sources does not mean that no energy release occurs there .",
    "we just can not `` observe '' the radiation because of the dynamic ranges of the instrument for those wavelengths .",
    "we compared the photospheric magnetic field strenghts at each h@xmath0 kernel with the spatial distribution of hxr sources , and found that hxr sources appear at strong magnetic regions .",
    "however , our result was based on only one event , and the statistical studies about the relation between hxr intensities and magnetic field strengths are needed",
    ". we will be able to perform more detailed analysis in the near future by using hxr images , with a higher dynamic range , obtained with the _ reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager _ ( _ rhessi _ ) .",
