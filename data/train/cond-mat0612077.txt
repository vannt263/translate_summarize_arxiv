    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "the heston model , which describes the dynamics of stock prices @xmath2 as a geometric brownian motion with the volatility given by the cir mean - reverting process , is defined by the following ito stochastic differential equations    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the time - dependent volatility , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are uncorrelated wiener processes with the usual statistical properties    @xmath7    in eq .",

    "this generalization represents a fictitious `` _ _ brownian particle _ _ '' moving in an _ effective _ potential with a metastable state , in order to model those systems with two different dynamical regimes like financial markets in normal activity and extreme days  @xcite .",
    "the equations of the new model are    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the _ effective _ cubic potential shown in fig .",

    "cm    let us call @xmath22 the abscissa of the potential maximum and @xmath23 the cross point between the potential and the @xmath24 axes .",
    "the intervals @xmath25 and @xmath26 $ ] are clearly regions of instability for the system . in systems with a metastable state , the random fluctuations can originate the noise enhanced stability ( nes ) phenomenon , an interesting effect that increases the stability , enhancing the lifetime of the metastable state  @xcite . the mean escape time @xmath27 for a brownian particle moving throughout a barrier @xmath28",
    "is given by the the well known exponential kramers law  @xcite    @xmath29 , \\label{eqn : kramers}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 is a monotonically decreasing function of the noise intensity @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is a prefactor which depends on the potential profile .",
    "this is true only if the random walk starts from initial positions inside the potential well .",
    "when the starting position is chosen in the instability region @xmath32 , @xmath27 exhibits an enhancement behavior , with respect to the deterministic escape time , as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "this is the nes effect and it can be explained by considering the barrier `` _ _ seen _ _ '' by the brownian particle starting at the initial position @xmath33 , that is @xmath34 .",

    "therefore for a brownian particle starting from an unstable initial position it is more likely to enter into the well than to escape from , once the particle has entered .",
    "so a small amount of noise can increase the lifetime of the metastable state . for a detailed discussion on this point and",

    "this last case corresponds to the usual parametric constant volatility regime .",
    "in fact , apart from an exponential transient , the volatility reaches the asymptotic value @xmath10 .",
    "the nes effect should be observable in the latter case as a function of @xmath10 , which is the average volatility .",
    "in fact , in this case we recover the motion of a brownian particle in a fixed cubic potential with a metastable state and an enhancement of its lifetime for particular initial conditions .",

    ", the initial plateau is an artifact of the calculus . indeed in the theoretical solution for the constant volatility case",
    ", @xmath27 diverges as the noise intensity approaches zero  @xcite .",
    "with such a noise intensity the escape from the well is a very unlikely event .",

    "once again we can not draw any conclusions for the constant behavior of @xmath27 , when the values of the parameter @xmath12 are very small , because of the finite number of simulation steps  @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile pointing out that the nes effect is not observable as a function of the parameter @xmath12 , if @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the presence of the reverting term affects the behavior of @xmath27 in the domain of the noise term of the volatility and it regulates the transition from nonmonotonic to monotonic regimes of met .",
    "moreover in this noise - only regime the volatility is proportional to the square of the wiener process and therefore the fluctuations during the monotonic decreasing behavior of @xmath27 are very large .",
    "we see three different dynamical regimes : ( i ) for low values of the parameter @xmath12 , with respect to the height of the potential barrier , we have a constant behavior , ( ii ) for intermediate values of @xmath12 we have fluctuations with decreasing monotonic behavior , ( iii ) for values of @xmath12 greater than @xmath53 , which is exactly the height of the barrier , we get very small and constant values of @xmath27 close to zero .",
    "this behavior is mainly due to the presence of the ito term in eq .",
    "( 5 ) for the log - returns @xmath16 . in fact , because of this term we have a fluctuating potential , obtained by the previous one by adding a linear term : @xmath54 .",
    "the effect of the positive linear term is to modify randomly the potential shape in such a way that the potential barrier disappears for greater values of the volatility @xmath40 . specifically for values of @xmath55",
    "the potential barrier is always present , while for @xmath56 it disappears .",
    "this produces a random enhancement of the escape process with a consequent decreasing behavior of the average escape time .",

    "the curves have a monotonic shape with a plateau .",
    "moreover , if one of the parameters is so big to push the system into a region where the noise is greater than the barrier height of the effective potential , the effect is no more observable at all . in the revert - only regime , instead , the nes phenomenon is recovered . with its regulatory effect",
    ", the reverting rate @xmath37 can be used to modulate the intensity of the stabilizing effect of the noise observed by varying @xmath10 and @xmath12 . in this parameter region",
    "the probability density function of the escape times of the returns fits very well that obtained from the experimental data extracted by real market .",
