    "these biases , searching for nearby dwarf galaxies with methodologies beyond the standard optical star count methods are essential .",
    "this motivates searches for dwarf galaxies using the 21 cm emission line of neutral hydrogen ( ) .",
    "while such searches can not identify passive dwarf galaxies like most local group satellites , which lack @xcite , they have the potential to find gas - rich , potentially starforming dwarf galaxies .",
    "this is exemplified by the case of the leo p dwarf galaxy , found first in and later confirmed via optical imaging @xcite .",
    "here we describe two faint dwarf galaxies identified via emission in the first data release of the galactic arecibo l - band feed array ( galfa - hi ) survey @xcite .",
    "as described below , they are likely within the local volume ( @xmath0 mpc ) but just beyond the local group ( @xmath5 mpc ) , so we refer to them as pisces a and b. this paper is organized as follows : in , we present the data used to identify these galaxies . in , we consider possible distance scenarios , while in we provide context and some conclusions .",
    "where relevant , we adopt a hubble constant of @xmath6 from wmap9 @xcite .",
    "the two galaxies we report on here were identified initially as cold clouds with possibly galaxy - like properties in dr1 of the galfa - hi survey @xcite .",
    "confirmation of these clouds as galaxies required additional optical imaging and spectroscopy , which we describe below .",
    "galfa - hi was performed with the arecibo observatory 305-m telescope , using the alfa feed array and the galspect spectrometer .",
    "galfa - hi dr1 @xcite includes velocities @xmath7 , covers 7520 square degrees of sky from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , has a channel spacing of @xmath10 , and a spatial resolution of @xmath11 .",
    "the sensitivity of dr1 varies with position , but the majority of the objects cataloged would have @xmath12 if at @xmath13 .",
    "the two candidate dwarfs were first found in a galfa - hi dr1 catalog that identified clouds with sizes @xmath14 and velocity @xmath15 @xcite . from the @xcite sample of 1964 clouds",
    ", @xcite identified 51 candidate galaxies with fluxes and sizes similar to the known gas - rich local group dwarf galaxies ( particularly leo t ) .",
    "the two candidates presented here were also identified by @xcite as being likely galaxies because they can not be easily associated with known high velocity cloud ( hvc ) complexes or galactic gas in position - velocity space .",
    "we performed follow - up optical imaging of 22 of the clouds from @xcite .",
    "these observations were performed with the podi instrument on the wiyn telescope in the @xmath16 and @xmath17-band filters , with integration times of 600 - 1200 sec per filter per target .",
    "standard imaging reductions were performed by the odi portal , pipeline , and archive facility .",
    "these include bias subtraction , flat - fielding , and alignment of individual orthogonal transfer array ( ota ) cells into chips .",
    "the swarp program @xcite was used to combine the individual exposures , and daophot @xcite was used to perform psf - fitting photometry on stars in the field .",
    "most of the clouds did _ not _ have optical counterparts with morphologies like nearby galaxies within the @xmath18 galfa - hi beam .",
    "those in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) footprint show neither diffuse features like the galaxies described below , nor point source overdensities to the limit of the dr 10 catalog .",
    "similarly , our deeper podi imaging showed neither overdensities nor red giant branch ( rgb ) features in the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) down to @xmath19 ( an rgb tip distance @xmath20 ) for any of the targets we observed other than the two described below .",

    "further comparisons require the answer to a crucial question : what is the distance to pisces a and pisces b ?",
    "we consider this question for each galaxy in turn below .",
    "we consider two scenarios for the distance to pisces a. the first is based on the assumption that pisces a is in the hubble flow .",
    "that is , its distance is simply @xmath60 .",
    "this case is considered in the first column of . in this scenario , pisces a is not part of the local group , but nearby , well within the local volume .",
    "our second scenario is based on the presence of resolved stars in pisces a ( upper - left panel of ) .",
    "the imaging shows the presence of blue point sources suggestive of young main sequence stars .",
    "if we consider leo p as a template for this galaxy , the brightest main sequence stars in leo p are comparable in magnitude to the pisces a stars ( @xcite , using the color transformations of @xcite ) .",
    "hence , for our second distance scenario , detailed in the second column of , we assume a distance equal to that of leo p ( @xmath61 , * ? ? ?",
    "pisces a is relatively close in projection to m31 , so in this scenario , @xmath62 .",
    "this is comparable to the local group s zero - velocity distance ( @xmath63 from @xcite ) , placing pisces a just beyond the edge of the local group .",
    "pisces b has a higher radial velocity than pisces a ( @xmath64 from the ) , yielding a larger distance in the hubble flow scenario ( @xmath65 ) . in this case ,",
    "pisces b is still within the local volume , but somewhat more luminous than leo p or pisces a , possibly akin to a blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) .",
    "this is further suggested by its higher line width ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "this scenario is considered in the third column of .    in the podi imaging ( upper - right panel of [ fig : images ] ) , pisces b appears to contain several potential point sources .",
    "however , pisces b has more diffuse light than pisces a , making it difficult to obtain accurate photometry and estimate a distance based on stellar cmds .",
    "additionally , the much stronger h@xmath23 emission apparent in ( lower - right panel ) , as well as its detection in the uv with _ galex _",
    "( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , donovan meyer et al . ,",
    "submitted ) , means that at least some of the brighter point sources may be unresolved regions rather than distinct stars .",
    "that said , if these point sources are resolved stars , it is possible that pisces b is somewhat closer than the hubble flow distance implies , and instead has a substantially positive peculiar velocity . in the absence of deeper and higher - resolution imaging to resolve this question , in the fourth column of , we simply consider the _ limiting _ case that pisces b is as close as the hubble flow scenario for pisces a.     upper panel : comparison of pisces a and pisces b to nearby dwarf galaxies in size vs. luminosity .",

    "the shield sample of low - mass -rich nearby dwarfs is from @xcite .",
    "the shaded bars show the properties of pisces a ( cyan ) and pisces b ( blue ) between the two distance scenarios discussed in the text . for the upper panel ,",
    "we use the @xcite transformations to convert from @xmath17-band magnitudes for pisces a and pisces b. for the lower panel , we make the estimate @xmath56 . ]",
    "in , we show pisces a and b in the context of nearby dwarf galaxies . these include the local group dwarfs ( as compiled in @xcite ) , the shield sample of nearby @xmath70 -rich galaxies @xcite , and leo p. the upper panel demonstrates that , depending on the distance , the galaxies described here may be among the faintest known star - forming galaxies .",
    "they also overlap in their basic structural properties with local group dwarfs , although they are somewhat more compact . unlike the local group galaxies , however , they are well beyond the virial radii of any large dark matter halo like that of the mw or m31",
    ". hence , they are crucial data points both for understanding how star formation functions at the lowest luminosities and as possible progenitors of the faint ( predominantly passive ) dwarf satellites of the local group .    additionally , the lower panel of shows they have a slightly higher mass relative to typical dwarfs of the same luminosity .",
    "the resulting gas fractions ( last row of ) , while high , are not necessarily surprising , as both the mean and scatter in gas fractions increase for fainter dwarfs ( @xcite , bradford et al . in prep ) .",
    "furthermore , these galaxies were discovered initially via , so detection biases favor higher masses .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of a significant nearby population of faint galaxies with high content may offer significant constraints on dwarf galaxy formation models .",
    "motivated by the existence of these galaxies , we are identifying further candidate nearby , faint , starforming dwarfs in the sdss . as discussed in , pisces a and pisces b have blue point sources in the sdss catalog ( although it mis - classifies them as galaxies due to the surrounding diffuse light ) .",
    "we conducted a search in the dr10 catalog for similar clusters of blue objects not associated with known galaxies or galactic structures .",
    "while most such overdensities turn out to be artifacts , @xmath71 show morphologies potentially consistent with nearby dwarf galaxies .",
    "an ongoing spectroscopic follow - up campaign on these objects shows that some do indeed have h@xmath23 emission consistent with local galaxies , and we will present these results in a future paper .",
    "detailed use of these galaxies as data points for galaxy formation will require more firm distances , only possible with deeper and/or higher resolution photometry ( which will be obtained by our approved cycle 22 _ hubble space telescope _ program ) .",
    "however , the detection of pisces a may have interesting interpretations in a cosmological context . to demonstrate this",
    ", we consider simulations from the elvis suite , designed to resemble the milky way / m31 pairing of the real local group @xcite .",
    "we mock observe dark matter halos in a frame with @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( relative to the host halo ) .",
    "galfa - hi can distinguish high velocity cloud complexes from galaxy candidates at @xmath74 @xcite , so we only consider halos with corresponding mock @xmath75 .",
    "we also ignore halos _ inside _ the host s virial radius , and with stellar masses @xmath76 .",
    "this yields @xmath77 halos .",
    "the first data release of galfa - hi covers @xmath78 of the sky , so we expect of order @xmath79 galaxies to be found in galfa - hi based on the above estimate of the number of elvis halos .",
    "if pisces a is anywhere in the distance range we consider here , it is the only one in the galfa - hi dr1 that falls in that range .",
    "( the most likely distances for pisces b place it beyond the edge of most of the elvis simulations . )",
    "this implies there is at least not an order - of - magnitude discrepancy between the expectations of @xmath2cdm and the observations .",
    "while only one object , this also hints that because the number density of -selected faint dwarfs is roughly the same as that of corresponding elvis halos , even these low - mass halos typically have if they are beyond the local group .",
    "we report two new nearby dwarf galaxies discovered from their emission , pisces a and b. they provide new opportunities to study some of the faintest starforming galaxies . while detailed interpretation of the galaxies depends on the ( uncertain ) distance , rough estimates of number density",
    "suggest broad consistency with @xmath2cdm .",
    "they also suggest that these galaxies could represent a larger population of nearby faint starforming dwarfs at the limits of detectability .",
