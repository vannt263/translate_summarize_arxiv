    "bose - einstein condensates with spin degrees of freedom  @xcite attracted in recent years great interest due to the unique possibility of exploring fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics in a remarkably controllable and tunable environment . the ability to generate spin squeezing and entanglement  @xcite makes spinor bose gases promising candidates for applications as quantum simulators  @xcite , in quantum information  @xcite , and for precise measurements  @xcite .",
    "moreover , spinor condensates were successfully used to recreate many of the phenomena of condensed matter physics in experiments displaying an unprecedented level of control over the quantum system . in particular ,",
    "spin domains  @xcite , spin mixing  @xcite , and spin vortices  @xcite were predicted and observed .",
    "the ground states of spin-1 condensates in homogeneous magnetic field have been studied in a number of previous works @xcite .",
    "the typical procedure consists of minimization of the total energy under constraints on the number of atoms and the longitudinal magnetization , which is well conserved in typical experimental conditions  @xcite .",
    "most of the studies , however , considered the condensate in the single - mode approximation , which assumes that the spin components share the same spatial profile @xcite , ignoring the possibility of phase separation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the breakdown of the single - mode approximation was shown numerically for a condensate confined in a harmonic potential . in a recent paper  @xcite",
    ", we studied the possibility of phase separation in the case of an untrapped condensate , and demonstrated that this phenomenon can take place in an antiferromagnetic condensate , leading to the splitting into two distinct phases . on the other hand ,",
    "ferromagnetic condensates were found not to display phase separation for any values of parameters .",
    "however , the trapping potential , present in any experimental realization , can strongly influence the structure of the ground states .",
    "indeed , in the context of binary condensates , it was previously shown that spatial separation of components can be induced by an external potential  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was called `` potential separation '' as opposed to `` phase separation '' which occurs spontaneously also in the untrapped case . moreover",
    ", the external potential determines the spatial structure of phase separated states . in general , phases that are characterized by energetically unfavorable interatomic interactions",
    "are moved towards the outer , low density regions , as demonstrated in spin - imbalanced fermi systems  @xcite and spinful bosons  @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate in detail the spatial separation of spin phases in the ground states of spin-1 condensates trapped in harmonic potentials .",
    "we find that the phase diagram of a trapped condensate is substantially different from the one of an untrapped condensate .",
    "we show that the external potential can make the antiferromagnetic condensate separate into three , and ferromagnetic condensate into two distinct phases .",
    "furthermore , we suggest an experimental method for the creation of these ground states by adiabatically changing the magnetic field strength .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec_model ] reviews the mean - field model of a spin-1 condensate in a homogeneous magnetic field and the possible spin phases .",
    "section  [ sec_tf ] presents analytical and qualitative results describing the structure of ground states in the thomas - fermi approximation . in section  [ sec_numerical ]",

    "we consider a dilute spin-1 bec in a homogeneous magnetic field pointing along the @xmath0 axis .",
    "we start with the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the wavefunctions of atoms in magnetic sublevels @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the atomic mass , @xmath6 is an external potential and @xmath7 is the total atom density .",
    "the asymmetric ( spin dependent ) part of the hamiltonian is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the zeeman energy shift for state @xmath10 and the spin density is , @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the spin-1 matrices  @xcite and @xmath13 .",
    "the spin - independent and spin - dependent interaction coefficients are given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the s - wave scattering length for colliding atoms with total spin @xmath17 .",
    "the total number of atoms and the total magnetization in the direction of the magnetic field @xmath18 are conserved quantities . the zeeman energy shift for each of the components",
    ", @xmath9 can be calculated using the breit - rabi formula  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the hyperfine energy splitting at zero magnetic field , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the bohr magneton , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the gyromagnetic ratios of nucleus and electron , and @xmath25 is the magnetic field strength .",
    "the linear part of the zeeman effect gives rise to an overall shift of the energy , and so we can remove it with the transformation @xmath26 this transformation is equivalent to the removal of the larmor precession of the spin vector around the @xmath0 axis @xcite .",
    "we thus consider only the effects of the quadratic zeeman shift .",
    "for sufficiently weak magnetic field we can approximate it by @xmath27 , which is always positive .    the asymmetric part of the hamiltonian ( [ ea ] )",
    "can now be rewritten as @xmath28 where the energy per atom @xmath29 is given by @xcite @xmath30 where the relative densities are @xmath31 .",
    "we also introduced the relative phase @xmath32 , spin per atom @xmath33 , and magnetization per atom @xmath34 .",

    "these quantities give the length scales of spatial variations in the condensate profile induced by the spin - independent or spin - dependent interactions , respectively .",
    "analogously , we define the magnetic healing length as @xmath41 .    in spin-1 condensates created to date",
    ", the @xmath42 and @xmath43 scattering lengths have similar magnitudes .",
    "the spin - dependent interaction coefficient @xmath44 is then much smaller than its spin - independent counterpart @xmath45 .",
    "for example , this ratio is about 1:30 in a @xmath46na condensate and 1:220 in a @xmath47rb condensate far from feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "consequently , changing the total density @xmath48 requires much more energy than changing the relative populations of spin states @xmath49 . in our considerations",
    "we will treat the total atom density profile @xmath50 as a constant , close to the thomas - fermi profile for a given potential @xmath51 .",
    "we recall the possible phases of spin-1 condensates in magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the stationary solutions in the case of a vanishing potential , @xmath52 , have the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a constant .",
    "these solutions are stationary in the sense that the number of atoms in each magnetic sublevel @xmath49 is constant in time , but the relative phases may change as a result of an additional spin precession around @xmath0 , as long as the phase matching condition @xmath55 is fulfilled @xcite . because the symmetric part of the hamiltonian in  ( [ en ] ) is constant , the relevant part of the hamiltonian is given by eq .",
    "( [ ea2 ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ en ] ) and gp equations  ( [ gp ] ) are invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath56 and rotation around the @xmath0 axis @xmath57 , which transform the wavefunction components according to @xmath58 hence the solutions can be classified using the relative densities @xmath31 and a single relative phase @xmath59 , with the chemical potentials @xmath60 given as solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ gp ] ) .",
    "we note that for stationary solutions with all three components populated the relative phase must take one of two values , @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "we call the former  phase - matched \" states ( pm ) and the latter  anti - phase - matched \" ( apm ) states .",
    "the names derive from the fact that within the continuum of states satisfying the spin rotations ( [ rotations ] ) there is a set @xmath63 with all components in phase for the pm states , and a set with @xmath64 and @xmath65 in phase but with @xmath66 @xmath67 out of phase for the apm states .",
    "in general , the possible stationary states can be classified as follows    1 .",
    "nematic state ( @xmath68 ) , with all the atoms in the @xmath69 component , @xmath70 .",
    "the chemical potential , spin density and energy per atom are equal to @xmath71 2 .",
    "magnetized states ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) , with all the atoms in the @xmath74 or in the @xmath75 component , @xmath76 or @xmath77 @xmath78 3 .   two - component or stretched states ( 2c ) , with @xmath79 and arbitrary magnetization @xmath80 4 .",
    "phase - matched states ( pm ) , where all three sublevels are populated , @xmath81 , and the relative phase is equal to @xmath82 .",
    "anti - phase - matched states ( apm ) , similar as the pm state but with @xmath83 .    the parameters of the pm and apm phases can not be expressed by analytical formulas in the general case .",
    "since all three components are populated in these states , the magnetization perpendicular to the magnetic field direction , @xmath84 , is nonzero .",
    "hence the axial symmetry of the system is broken  @xcite .",
    "these above classification is also applicable to inhomogeneous condensates within the single - mode approximation ( sma ) , which assumes that the spin components share the same spatial profile @xcite , after replacing @xmath48 with @xmath85 .",
    "this assumption is true eg .  when the condensate size is much smaller than the spin healing length @xmath86 and the magnetic healing length @xmath87 .",
    "in this section , we investigate the structure of the ground states in harmonic potential within the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation ( or local density approximation ) , neglecting the kinetic energy in the hamiltonian  ( [ en ] ) .",
    "this approximation is justified when the spatial variation of the condensate wavefunction gives a contribution that is relatively small , in particular when the size of the condensate is much larger than both @xmath86 and @xmath87 .    within our assumptions ,",
    "the asymmetric part of the energy  ( [ ea ] ) is a small contribution to the total energy .",
    "the profile of the total density is determined by the minimization of the symmetric part of the free energy with a fixed particle number @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the lagrange multiplier corresponding to the chemical potential .",
    "the minimization of this functional gives the well known thomas - fermi profile @xmath90 .",
    "analogously , to determine the spin structure , we minimize the asymmetric part of the energy @xmath91 with a fixed total magnetization @xmath5 @xmath92 the minimum of this functional requires that @xmath93 when moving from one point in space to another .",
    "this condition is not applicable to the completely magnetized @xmath73 , @xmath72 and the unmagnetized @xmath68 phase , for which @xmath94 is undefined  @xcite .",
    "since we work within the thomas - fermi approximation and neglect the spatial derivatives , at each point in space the local phase corresponds to a ground state of a homogeneous condensate  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the change of local parameters ( density and magnetization ) in space may lead to the change of the local ground state and the appearance of spatial domains .    in the case of an antiferromagnetic condensate ,",
    "there are five possible local ground state phases : @xmath73 , @xmath72 , @xmath68 , 2c and apm  @xcite .",
    "the last two of them allow for a variation of the local magnetization . in the case of the 2c phase",
    ", the condition  ( [ dem ] ) gives @xmath96 hence the difference in the density of atoms in the @xmath97 and the @xmath98 components is constant .",
    "for the apm state , the asymmetric energy ( further on we call it simply the energy ) is not an analytical function of @xmath48 and @xmath99 , and we approximate it with the formula @xmath100 , which gives less than @xmath101 error for any @xmath48 and @xmath99 .",
    "the condition  ( [ dem ] ) gives @xmath102 which obviously can not be fulfilled if the density profile is not homogeneous .",
    "consequently , the apm phase is unstable , because the transfer of magnetization from the central , high density area to the outer regions is always energetically favorable .",
    "hence , the ground state can contain @xmath73 , @xmath72 , @xmath68 , and/or 2c domains , the latter fulfilling the condition  ( [ 2c_cond ] ) .",
    "the other question is the placement of the domains .",
    "since the local ground state depends on the density , the domains arrange according to the distance from the center of the trap , as in fig .",
    "[ structure](a ) .",
    "let us consider two domains , one of them composed of phase x placed at the area 1 and the other composed of phase y placed at the area 2 , containing equal number of atoms .",
    "if the energy per atom of the phase x is constant , ( which is the case for the @xmath68 phase ) , then swapping of the domains as in fig .",
    "[ structure](a ) will not lead to the change of its energy @xmath103 on the other hand , if the energy per atom of the phase y is proportional to the number of atoms , @xmath104 , as for the @xmath105 or 2c phases , the difference in its energy is @xmath106 in result , it is energetically favorable for the @xmath68 phase to stay in the high density area in the center of the trap .",
    "moreover , the @xmath73 or @xmath72 phase will be moved further than the 2c phase to the outer areas , since their coefficient @xmath107 is larger .",
    "we obtain the general domain structure depicted in fig .",
    "[ structure](b ) , shown for positive @xmath5 ( for negative @xmath5 , the local magnetization is opposite and the @xmath73 state is replaced by @xmath72 ) .",
    "the boundary between the phases @xmath68 and 2c corresponds to a first order phase transition , and the boundary between the phases 2c and @xmath73 to a second order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "we note that not all of the phases must be present .",
    "if all three domains are present , we can derive the relation between @xmath108 and @xmath109 by calculating the change of the total energy when changing the domain sizes @xmath107 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "since the magnetization is conserved , we have @xmath112 and consequently @xmath113 .",

    "the possible ground state phases are @xmath73 , @xmath72 , @xmath68 , and pm  @xcite . since it is difficult to propose a simple analytical formula for the energy of the pm phase , we resort to a qualitative analysis using the condition  ( [ dem ] ) .    .",

    "the energy per atom in the @xmath68 phase is constant , while the energy in the pm phase is a decreasing function of density , due to the spin - dependent atomic interaction with a negative @xmath44 .",

    "the conventional imaginary time method is not suitable for this problem since the normalization of the wavefunction effectively imposes that the chemical potentials @xmath60 are equal , thus failing to take into account some of the ground states .",
    "we note that the direction of the magnetic field with respect to the trap orientation does not influence our results , since only the contact interactions are taken into account in our model .",
    "the setup consists of a highly elongated cigar - shaped harmonic trap , the longitudinal size of the condensate being much larger than other length scales , i.e.  the spin and magnetic healing lengths @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "this ensures that the contribution of the kinetic energy ( e.g.  at the boundaries between domains ) is small compared to other energy scales in the system , which is the requirement for the application of the thomas - fermi approximation .",

    "this can be understood by noting that the zeeman energy of the @xmath151 component is decreased with respect to the @xmath122 components when increasing the magnetic field strength .",
    "this is the reason for the appearance of the @xmath68 domain which eventually replaces the 2c phase completely , in accordance with the condition  ( [ eq_3p ] ) .",

    "<S> we consider a spin-1 bose - einstein condensate trapped in a harmonic potential under the influence of a homogeneous magnetic field . we investigate spatial and spin structure of the mean - field ground states under constraints on the number of atoms and the total magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the trapping potential can make the antiferromagnetic condensate separate into three , and ferromagnetic condensate into two distinct phases . in the ferromagnetic case , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization is located in the center of the harmonic trap , while in the antiferromagnetic case magnetized phases appear in the outer regions . </S>",
    "<S> we describe how the transition from the thomas - fermi regime to the single - mode approximation regime with decreasing number of atoms results in the disappearance of the domains . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the ground states can be created in experiment by adiabatically changing the magnetic field strength . </S>"
