    "we model a number of different orbit categories arising from orientations of tree graphs @xmath7 in geometric terms .",
    "the description we propose here is based on the idea of doubling the set of oriented diagonals in a given regular polygon and combine the dynamics of these two sets in an appropriate way .    among the additive categories we can model in this way we find cluster categories of type @xmath7 , as well as other triangulated categories of various calabi - yau dimension .",
    "all these categories arise as mesh categories of a translation quiver whose vertices are single coloured oriented and paired diagonals in a polygon @xmath8 .",
    "we will see that polygons of different sizes yield different categories and these are calabi - yau of dimension two only in few exceptional cases .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that we can model the combinatorics of these various categories in terms of configurations of diagonals in @xmath8 .    for a tree diagram @xmath7",

    "we have the following equivalences of additive categories : @xmath13    when @xmath7 is not of dynkin type we obtain an equivalence from the category @xmath14 associated to the infinite sided - polygon @xmath15 to the full subcategory of the cluster category @xmath9 with indecomposable objects in the transjective component of the ar - quiver of @xmath9 .",

    "all 833 cluster tilting sets of @xmath17 can be expressed as configurations of six non - crossing coloured oriented single and paired diagonals inside two heptagons .",
