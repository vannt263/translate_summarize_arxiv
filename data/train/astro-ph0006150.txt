    "m87 is one of the most famous radio galaxies , mainly due to studies of its non - thermal jet and activity in its nucleus .",
    "however , most of the radio emission responsible for its discovery in the 1940 s @xcite comes from a much larger scale with a projected end - to - end length of about 80 kpc @xcite .",
    "the large scale structure has been studied more recently @xcite .",
    "nevertheles , the connection of the larger radio structure to the jet and the inner lobes has remained obscure .",
    "m87 sits at the center of the x - ray luminous atmosphere of the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "the x - ray atmosphere has a simple , apparently undisturbed morphology with a central luminosity peak .",
    "this atmosphere has been interpreted as a cooling flow @xcite , but the situation may be more complex @xcite .",
    "in addition , the inner region of the x - ray atmosphere has an unusual structure @xcite .",
    "once again , the connection of the radio source to the x - ray atmosphere has remained obscure .    in this paper",
    "we report new 90 cm observations with the vla of the large scale radio emission with much higher dynamic range and resolution than has been achieved previously . based on these new data ,",
    "we propose that the radio halo is alive , rather than being a relic of some previous activity , and it is interacting strongly with the inner regions of the cluster s x - ray atmosphere .",
    "the observations were made over a period of many years with the vla in spectral line mode .",
    "the earlier data comes from dual frequency observations at 74 and 321 mhz in the a , b and c configurations .",
    "images from these data were encouraging , so the bulk of the data in the current image were collected in the 1998 a and b arrays at 321 and 327 mhz , also in the spectral line mode .",
    "the use of narrow channels of 0.1 mhz or less reduces the systematic instrumental errors , which often limit such observations , and the radial smearing of the confusing sources , which makes them easier to remove and scatters less real power into the noise .",
    "it also facilitates editing of intermittent , mainly external , narrow - band rfi .",
    "the observations used 3c286 for initial amplitude and phase calibration and to set the standard vla flux density scale which derives from @xcite .",
    "the entire field was imaged using the aips program imagr in 3d mode and selfcalibrated using calib .",
    "the confusing sources were then subtracted from the _ uv _ data and the remaining imaging and calibration was performed on just the central field containing m87 .",
    "further editing , imaging and self - calibration were then carried out .",
    "the final image was produced using the maximum entropy program , vtess . in figure",
    "[ m87color ] , we show the resulting image as a false - color representation of the full image . in figure [ m87pc ] , we show a grey - scale blowup of the central region showing the complex structure of brighter features more clearly . in figure [ minpfig ]",
    "we show a greyscale of the full source as well as the locations of minimum pressure measurements discussed later in the paper .",
    "several features of this image are striking .",
    "the very inner region ( which appears as the red / orange patch in the center of figure [ m87color ] ) contains the well - known jet , which points to the northwest .",
    "this inner region ( or inner `` lobes '' ) extends about 2 kpc from the core .",
    "two collimated flows emerge from this region , one directed almost exactly eastward , and the other directed slightly north of west .",
    "the initial direction of the westward flow is roughly aligned with the direction of the inner jet , although the flow quickly bends and twists once it leaves the inner region .",
    "the flows appear to consist of a mass of bright , curved structures , which we call filaments .",
    "the eastern flow ends in a well - defined pair of edge brightened circular lobes .",
    "this ear - shaped structure is reminiscent of a subsonic vortex ring .",
    "the western flow develops a gradual but well - defined southward twist , starting only a few kpc beyond the inner lobes .",
    "finally , both flows are immersed in a larger structure which might be described as two overlapping `` bubbles '' , each extending about 40 kpc from the nucleus .",
    "the coherent flows appear to be continuous , from the point at which they emerge from the inner lobes , to the outer edge of the radio halo . after reaching the halo , the flows gradually",
    "disperse  the westward flow particuarly  and appear to be filling the entire halo with radio - loud , filamented plasma .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ m87color ] , the bubbles end abruptly , with well - defined outer boundaries which are slighly limb brightened around perhaps half of the periphery .",
    "the brightest filaments stand out clearly from the general emission , suggesting higher minimum pressures than the average over the source .",
    "the results of minimum pressure analysis for the magnetic fields and relativistic particles in the filaments are given in table [ minp ] as calculated at the positions indicated in figure [ minpfig ] .",
    "we have assumed a frequency range of 10 mhz to 10 ghz ; a spectral index , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , a proton - to - electron energy ratio @xmath2 , and that the factor @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the ratio of the true magnetic pressure to @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the fraction of the volume occupied by relativistic electrons that is also occupied by magnetic field .",
    "for the geometry of each feature we have assumed a cylinder parallel to the line of sight with radius equal to the vla clean beam fwhm and a length equal to the projected width on the sky ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we take a distance of 17 mpc , so that 1 asec corresponds to 85 pc .    in table",
    "[ xrayp ] we give estimated values of the density , temperature and pressure from @xcite scaled to our assumed distance of 17 mpc .",
    "comparison of tables [ minp ] and [ xrayp ] shows that all the filaments have somewhat lower minimum pressures than the surrounding thermal gas .",
    "if the filling factor , @xmath8 , is near one , the more diffuse regions of the source have minimum pressures an order of magnitude below the thermal pressures .",
    "this could imply that the synchrotron emitting regions are far from the minimum pressure case , that the filling factor of the emitting regions is @xmath9 , or that the thermal gas is mixed with synchrotron emitting regions and provides much of the pressure inside the filaments .",
    "virgo a does not fit neatly into the morphologies usually assigned to radio galaxies . it is clearly not an fr type ii , because it does not have outer hot spots .",
    "this has led people to describe it as an fr type i. while it may fit the strict definition of an fr i ( being brightest closest to the core ) , it has little in common with most fr i radio galaxies .",
    "type i sources generally contain coherent jets which slowly become wider and fainter the further out one looks from the parent galaxy nucleus . virgo a , at least as we see it projected on the sky , does not match this description .",
    "we suspect that virgo a is more closely related to a class of amorphous , steep spectrum sources , e.g. @xcite , which are found only in dense cores of galaxy clusters .",
    "we are aware of several comparable radio sources , e.g. in a133 , a2052 , a2626 @xcite , and a2199 @xcite ; all are attached to central dominant galaxies in strong cooling cores .",
    "the fact that all such sources are found in a special position relative to their parent cluster ( as well as their parent cluster being special in having a strong cooling core ) argues against them being simply normal , fr type i , tailed sources seen in severe projection .",
    "it seems more likely that the interaction of the jet with the dense , high - pressure external medium is more extreme than in most radio galaxies , and that the jet is bent or disrupted as it tries to flow through the dense external medium .",
    "the virgo a radio halo is our best opportunity to study such an interaction .",
    "the m87 radio halo , virgo a , looks like two bubbles which are supported by the energy of poorly collimated outflows from the core .",
    "three observations support this idea .",
    "first , the radio halo is the same size at all observed frequencies , from 74 and 330 mhz @xcite , to 10.6 ghz @xcite .",
    "second , the outer boundary is relatively sharp and is slightly limb brightened over about half of its circumference .",
    "third , the new images show what seem to be two directed outflows which connect the inner jet and inner lobes to the full scale of the halo .    from this evidence we can immediately eliminate two possible models .",
    "the halo is not due to single - particle diffusion through the cluster gas ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a picture predicts the size would depend on frequency , due to synchrotron aging . nor is the measured size of the halo limited by fading surface brightness in a simple outflow , as in many type i radio tails .",
    "this hypothesis would again predict frequency - dependent sizes , and also disagrees with the sharp rise at the edge , described in  2 .",
    "it is also apparent that the halo region is inhomogeneous .",
    "the halo plasma is highly filamented .",
    "the radio - loud filaments can be regions with high field strength , high relativistic particle density , or both .",
    "we can not uniquely describe the interfilament regions .",
    "they could simply be low - field , or low - particle - density , regions .",
    "alternatively , they could be regions dominated by thermal plasma from the cluster atmosphere . despite the fact that the outer edge of the radio halo is sharp and well defined",
    ", there is no strong evidence of a `` hole '' in the x - ray image .",
    "kpc , suggestive of some interaction ; we have found this in archived rosat data , and it can also just be seen in the density profile from @xcite . ]",
    "this suggests that the x - ray loud plasma has managed at least partially to penetrate the halo region .",
    "we draw an important conclusion from the   kpc from the galactic core .",
    "previous workers have assumed that the inner halo is the only active region of the source .",
    "there is , indeed , a sharp drop in surface brightness between the inner and outer haloes , making imaging of the transition very hard .",
    "however , there is no observational evidence for a well - defined outer edge to the inner halo , such as there is for the outer edge of the outer halo .",
    "we thus differ with recent models of m87 @xcite , which assume the inner halo traps all of the energy coming through the jet .",
    "we can imagine two possibilities for the inner halo .",
    "one is that it is a quasi - steady part of the flow , resulting from some choking of the flow which leads to a high - pressure , radio - bright inner region .",
    "if this is the case , the inner halo must be a porous structure , with most of the jet power flowing through it to the outer halo .",
    "another possibility is that the inner halo is a recent transient , short lived compared to the outer halo ( which we show below is @xmath10 100 myr old ) , possibly due to a recent change in the activity level of the core .",
    "if this is the case it may have trapped a significant part of the recent output from the jet , and be acting like a small bubble within a larger bubble .",
    "returning to the outer halo , and our picture of it as a large expanding bubble , what can we say about the details ?",
    "the magnetic fields and relativistic particles have minimum pressures somewhat less than the thermal gas .",
    "however , the uncertainities in such analyses , especially the filling factor of the synchrotron emitting plasma , allow the possibility of a much larger relativistic component .",
    "thus , there are two possible models for what we are seeing , depending on whether the region is dominated by thermal or relativistic pressure .",
    "it is possible that the synchrotron emitting regions are far from the minimum pressure case , with either the field or the relativistic particles strongly dominating",
    ". this can happen if the radio - loud region is inhomogeneous on scales smaller than the resolution of our image ( that is , if the radio - loud plasma has a small filling factor within our resolved filaments ) , or if the relativistic protons carry much more energy than do the relativistic electrons .",
    "it can also happen if the region is simply dominated by pressure from one of the components , either relativistic particles or magnetic field .",
    "if this is the case , then virgo a is primarily a relativistic bubble .",
    "the boundary apparent in the images is between the primarily relativistic , radio - loud plasma and the thermal plasma further out in the cluster .",
    "the ongoing energy input to the plasma within this region will drive an expansion of the entire bubble .",
    "if this is the case , thermal material inside the bubble must come from leakage through the boundary over the period of expansion .",
    "we are reminded of the semi - porous nature of the terrestrial magnetopause , which allows partial penetration of the solar wind through local , intermittent magnetic reconnection .",
    "if this is the case , the mixing of thermal and relativistic plasma internal to the halo is most likely macroscopic  resulting in relativistic , radio - loud filaments with only low thermal gas density , surrounded by interfilament regions dominated with thermal gas .",
    "it is also possible that the synchrotron emitting regions are close to the minimum pressure case .",
    "the results of the minimum pressure analysis , taken at face value , are most consistent with a thermally dominated model . in order to maintain pressure balance with the x - ray atmosphere",
    ", the emitting regions must contain a significant amount of thermal gas .",
    "if this is so , the emitting regions represent only a small fraction of the total energy inside virgo a. in this case the jet must deposit its material and energy directly in the thermal material .",
    "this picture requires more effective mixing , on the microscopic scale , of the relativistic radio - loud plasma and the ambient thermal plasma .",
    "if this is the case , the simple expanding bubble model can still describe the more complex physical processes which are taking place .",
    "one possibility is that the jet is depositing its matter , and energy , on scales @xmath10 tens of kpc from the core , in the form of turbulence and heat .",
    "some of the turbulent energy may then be transformed into magnetic energy through the turbulent dynamo process .",
    "the heated thermal gas will expand to maintain balance with the unheated igm outside this region .",
    "thus the bubble is formed .",
    "the well - defined edge seen in the images is then the interface between the heated , expanding , mixed thermal - relativistic gas , and the undisturbed x - ray atmosphere ahead of the expansion surface .",
    "whichever picture best describes the m87 halo , the energy input into the bubbles comes from the energy carried in the outflow from the nucleus .",
    "we can use a simple model to describe the dynamics and estimate the age of virgo a. following our analysis of a2199 @xcite , we model virgo a as a single spherical bubble , with a steady energy input given by @xmath11 , the total energy flux from the nucleus and jet .",
    "we assume the bubble is in approximate pressure balance with the ambient medium , and expands due to its internal energy .",
    "this system can be analyzed through simple energetics , without needing detailed knowledge of the composition of the plasma inside the bubble .",
    "we do need to estimate the jet power , however .",
    "this is easier to do for m87 than for more distant , less well - studied radio sources .",
    "the total flux of useable energy carried by matter in a relativistic jet is ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) p_j = r_j^2 v_j if @xmath12 and @xmath13 describe the jet pressure , mass density , lorentz factor and velocity , respectively .",
    "we do not know enough about the jet in m87 to estimate a good value for @xmath11 , but we do know enough about the jet to estimate its minimum value , @xmath14 .",
    "we do this by considering only the internal pressure in the jet plasma , which can be constrained by observations .",
    "we thus ignore both the plasma inertia , @xmath15 , and any magnetic field exceeding that corresponding to the minimum - pressure measurement .",
    "( @xcite also argue from their specific instability models that @xmath16 . )",
    "the flow velocity in the inner jet , on scales @xmath17 kpc , is very likely relativistic , with @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we can thus estimate @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the jet radius can be measured directly from high - resolution images , such as in @xcite ( ohc ) .",
    "the jet pressure can not be found directly , but we can use the minimum pressure derived from radio and optical observations .",
    "@xcite ( bsh ) derive minimum pressures by assuming the jet is uniformly filled with radio - loud plasma .",
    "alternatively , ohc argue that the radio emission comes from thin helices on the surface of the jet ; this small volume gives them minimum pressure values several times higher than given by bsh .",
    "( their model would require a comparable pressure throughout the jet , in order to maintain a stable structure . )",
    "we can thus use the bsh value to estimate the minimum likely @xmath11 , noting that it may be higher . for knot",
    "d , we measure a radius of 22 pc ; bsh give @xmath21dyn/@xmath22 , and ohc give @xmath23dyn/@xmath22 . for knot",
    "a , we measure a radius of 62 pc ; bsh give @xmath24dyn/@xmath22 , and ohc give @xmath25dyn/@xmath22 .",
    "these result in a minimum jet power @xmath26 erg / s at knot d , and @xmath27 erg / s at knot a. we conclude that a conservative estimate of the jet power is @xmath28 erg / s , and we use this to scale our modelling in what follows .    finally , we compare this to the total power radiated by m87 .",
    "the total radio power of the source is @xmath29 erg / s ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mhz - 150 ghz , scaled to 17 mpc distance ) .",
    "this is not the total luminosity , however ; the jet is a strong optical and x - ray source . from bsh",
    ", we estimate the total jet power @xmath30 erg / s ; giving a total luminosity @xmath31 erg / s for m87 .",
    "interestingly , this is @xmath10 1% of our conservatively estimated jet power , which in consistent with the general picture of radio galaxies as low - efficiency radiators .",
    "we picture the halo as a region of hot plasma , undergoing steady energy input from the jet at rate @xmath11 .",
    "let the halo plasma have adiabatic index @xmath32 , pressure @xmath33 , volume @xmath34 and internal energy @xmath35 .",
    "radiative losses from the halo are @xmath36 .",
    "energy conservation tells us that the expansion is governed by @xcite @xmath37 if @xmath36 is small compared to @xmath11 ( as is true for m87 ) , this relation can easily be solved for @xmath38 . to be specific",
    ", we assume the halo is a spherical bubble of radius @xmath39 , containing plasma with adiabatic index @xmath32 , expanding due to its own internal energy . in a slow expansion ,",
    "during which the pressure of the bubble does not greatly exceed that of the surroundings , we can make the approximation that the inteior pressure remains comparable to the exterior pressure .",
    "if the exterior pressure decays with radius , the governing equation becomes @xmath40 the x - ray data , summarized in table 2 , can be represented as @xmath41 dyn @xmath42 , with @xmath43 kpc . using this in equation ( 2 ) , we find @xmath44 we scale the jet power to @xmath45erg / s .",
    "we take @xmath46 kpc as the current size of the source .",
    "kpc to allow for modest projection effects . ]",
    "details of the expansion are sensitive to @xmath32 , the internal adiabatic index .",
    "the two possibilities are @xmath47 , which describes a non - relativistic plasma ( assuming most of the plasma in the bubble is thermal ) , and @xmath48 ( appropriate if the bubble is dominated by relativistic particles and magnetic field ) .",
    "the current age of the radio halo is @xmath49 myr , if @xmath47 ; this increases to @xmath50 myr if @xmath51 .",
    "we can estimate the current expansion rate of the outer edge , from equation ( 3 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath52 km / s if @xmath48 , and @xmath53 km / s if @xmath47 .",
    "for comparison , the sound speed in the external gas is @xmath54 km / s , so that the expansion is subsonic .",
    "the internal energy of the bubble at time @xmath55 is @xmath56 .",
    "thus , a fraction @xmath57 of the total jet power goes to internal energy if @xmath47 ; this fraction becomes @xmath58 if @xmath48 . the rest of the jet power goes to @xmath59 work ( and a small fraction to radiation ) .      to summarize , we find that the radio halo is still alive , rather than being a relic of previous activity .",
    "it is expanding at about 1/4 of the local sound speed , and is significantly younger than the galaxy that hosts it .",
    "however , this is not the end of the story ; several interesting questions remain unanswered .",
    "what is the origin of the bright radio filaments ?",
    "there are at least three possibilities .",
    "the first is that they are highly compressed regions , or shocks , in transonic turbulence .",
    "the second is that they are the intermittent magnetic flux tubes seen in mhd turbulence at even low turbulent mach numbers @xcite .",
    "the third is that they are similar to the filaments seen in numerical simulations of passive - field radio sources @xcite .",
    "all three possibilities will lead to regions of high field and possibly high particle density , which will be bright in synchrotron radiation .    what is the nature of the `` ear '' at the east edge of the source ?",
    "deyoung ( 1998 , private communication ) pointed out to us that it resembles a subsonic vortex ring .",
    "this is an interesting possibility .",
    "little is known about vortex rings in compressible , magnetized plasmas , but one might expect them to retain their basic characteristics .",
    "its reason for existence , however , remains unclear .",
    "further , are the east and west flows fundamentally different , so that one disrupts and one creates a vortex ring , or is the different environmental ?    is _ in situ _ electron acceleration necessary ? in the bright filaments , with @xmath60 g , electrons radiating at 1 ghz live only @xmath61 myr , which is a bit less than the age of the halo .",
    "this result suggests either that the electrons undergo _ in situ _ re - acceleration in the filaments , or else that they spend most of their life in a weaker magnetic field , possibly in the interfilament region .",
    "what is the nature of the outer edge , and how efficient is the mixing across it , of external gas with radio - loud plasma ?",
    "the x - ray profile , together with the apparent integrity of the radio edge , suggests there has been partial mixing .",
    "should we look to the earth s magnetopause for an analogy ( where patchy reconnection allows some fraction of the incoming plasma to mix across the boundary ) ? this may be a good analogy if the edge of the bubble is defined by a quasi - parallel magnetic field .",
    "alternatively , should we look to the outer edges of old supernova remnants ( which have highly filamented outer shells , and are thus more `` open '' to mixing with the ambient gas ) ?",
    "this may be a better analogy of the edge of the bubble is governed by fluid , not magnetic , processes .    finally , why is this radio galaxy so unusual ? most radio galaxies at this power are supported by jets which remain collimated and directed for scales @xmath62 kpc .",
    "however , the m87 jet continues undisturbed for only a few kpc .",
    "what is the reason for the jet disruption so close the galactic center ? is it connected somehow to the dense cooling core in which the source sits , and with the existence of a small set of amorphous central radio galaxies in other , similar , cooling - core clusters ?",
    "the virgo x - ray halo is smooth , centrally peaked , and nearly circular ( ellipticity @xmath63 on large scales @xcite . using spherical deprojection of rosat data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also table 2 ) , one derives densities and temperatures which suggest that the cooling time is less than the hubble time for the inner @xmath64 kpc .",
    "the smooth x - ray structure and short central cooling time have led various authors to suggest that m87 sits in the center of a modest cooling flow . in the simple cooling - flow model ,",
    "radiative losses are balanced by slow settling of the gas in the cluster gravitational potential ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "for m87 , the cooling inflow has been estimated as @xmath65/yr ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , again scaled to 17 mpc ) .",
    "such a smooth , spherically symmetric inflow , with the densities given in table 2 , will be very slow : it will have inflow velocity @xmath66 km / s at 50 kpc .",
    "consideration of the radio data shows that the picture is more complex than a simple cooling - driven inflow .",
    "this is demonstrated by several pieces of evidence .    _ the radio image _",
    "itself shows evidence of a disturbed inner halo .",
    "the filaments suggest both directed and disordered flows .",
    "these flows are magnetized and possibly transonic ( which we suggest based on the enhanced radio emission from the filaments , which are probably regions of strong magnetic field ) .    _ high - resolution x - ray data _ @xcite show complex structure in the inner @xmath67 kpc of the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "this gas has a very asymmetric distribution , with approximately the same extent as the radio halo .",
    "in addition , new work by @xcite shows that the x - ray excess is enhanced in a narrow ridge which crosses the jet close to knot a , the brightest knot in optical and radio .",
    "this strongly suggests that the jet and the x - ray gas are interacting on this scale .",
    "_ the dynamic radio halo _ is being supplied with energy from the jet .",
    "it should be expanding outwards , into the thermal gas , driven by its own internal energy .",
    "our simple model predicts an expansion speed @xmath68 km / s , which is approximately 1/4 of the local sound speed .",
    "this must have an impact on the ambient cluster gas .    _ the inner few kpc _ of m87 , at least , are magnetized and turbulent .",
    "emission line clouds embedded in the gas are moving at @xmath69 km / s @xcite .",
    "it is very likely that these clouds share the velocity field of the hotter gas in which they sit .",
    "in addition , faraday rotation data reveal dynamically significant , ordered magnetic fields in this region @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is probably supported by transonic turbulence @xcite . taken together , these observations suggests that the very inner part of the m87 halo is turbulent , probably at transonic levels .",
    "the evidence shows that the virgo core is a complex place . on scales",
    "@xmath70 kpc , it contains a dynamic mixture of relativistic particles , thermal plasma and magnetic fields .",
    "we suspect that the entire halo is similar to the inner few kpc , being turbulent and magnetized at significant levels .",
    "it follows that this region can not be described as a simple cooling flow .",
    "this can be demonstrated by basic energetics .",
    "the bolometric x - ray luminosity from the region occupied by the radio source , roughly the central 40 kpc , is @xmath71erg / s .",
    "( to derive this , we use the densities and temperatures from table 2 , with the cooling curve given by westbury and henriksen 1992 ) .",
    "the central cooling can also be found using the value given by @xcite for @xmath72 within cooling core , scaling that value to 17 mpc , and then using the deprojected density structure from table 2 to find the luminosity within 40 kpc ) . in the absence of a comparable energy input ,",
    "the central gas must indeed cool , and collapse in the gravitational well of the system .",
    "however , the picture is not so simple for virgo .",
    "the black hole in the galactic nucleus is currently supplying @xmath73 erg / s to the radio halo .",
    "only a small fraction of this is leaked to radio emission .",
    "the bulk of this energy must be deposited in kinetic or internal energy of the composite plasma in the virgo core .",
    "this input is at least as large , and probably much larger , than the radiative losses from the core .",
    "it follows that the region is more complex than a simple cooling flow .",
    "@xcite has already pointed this out , and we agree with him",
    ".    what effects might we expect ?",
    "the energy from the core is being deposited on a scale @xmath74 kpc , throughout the radio halo .",
    "some fraction of the jet energy will go to turbulence or bulk flows ( such as the @xmath68 km / s expansion of the bubble ) , while the rest will go directly to heating .",
    "the heat will directly drive an outwards expansion of the heated gas into the cooler , lower - pressure gas sitting above it .",
    "the turbulence will enhance magnetic fields , through dynamo effects , which may in turn enhance the turbulence through magnetic buoyancy .",
    "we can not predict the exact fraction of energy deposited in flows or in heat ; recalling the energetics estimated in  3.2.2 , we might estimate that approximately half the energy goes into each mode .",
    "the thermal state of the gas will be determined by all of these competing processes  heating , radiative cooling , thermal conduction , expansion , turbulence and turbulent dissipation .",
    "x - ray data find a component of gas at @xmath75 kev in the inner arcmin , and warmer gas at @xmath76 kev outside of @xmath76 arcmin @xcite .",
    "our simple arguments here can not predict the full temperature structure of the core .",
    "previous steady - state , spherically symmetric models @xcite , provided interesting first attempts but also can not address the complexity of the region . more detailed , time - dependent simulations will be required .    in the absence of full numerical simulations ,",
    "simple lifetime considerations can be helpful .",
    "the current energy content within @xmath77 kpc is @xmath78 erg ( again using data from table 2 ) .",
    "if the jet maintains an average energy input of @xmath79 ergs s@xmath80 , we can expect something like half of that power to be deposited in the cluster gas , perhaps shared equally between direct heating , and turbulence ( which will eventually decay into indirect heating ) .",
    "it follows that it will take @xmath81 myr to deposit an amount of energy comparable to that currently in the region . for comparison ,",
    "the radiative lifetime of the region is @xmath82 gyr .",
    "thus , based on our estimated lower limit for the jet power , its energy input clearly dominates radiative losses at present .",
    "we estimated above that the current age of the radio halo is @xmath83 myr .",
    "thus , the radio halo is young compared to the age of the galaxy , but `` just right '' compared to the energy turnover times in the virgo core .",
    "this suggests to us an on - off duty cycle for the central engine in m87 .",
    "the engine may have been active for only 100 - 200 myr , which happens to be comparable to the energy turnover times for the core . as long as the engine remains active at its current level",
    ", it will have a strong effect on the local cluster core .",
    "it will heat the core and support turbulence , bulk flows and magnetic fields in that core .",
    "these extra pressure sources will in turn offset radiative cooling , support the gas against gravitational infall , and possibly drive the central regions outwards in a local expansion .",
    "once the central engine turns off , the gas will cool and return to a quasi - static state as the turbulence and bulk flows dissipate . @xcite",
    "have simulated a similar situation for a smaller galaxy ( with the differences that they assumed the energy was all deposited at the very center of the flow , and in their spherically symmetric model they could not include turbulent flows or magnetic fields ) .",
    "their calculation shows the cyclic response of the ambient gas as it heats and cools , expands and collapses , in response to the activity cycle of the central energy source .",
    "we have obtained new and wonderful radio images of virgo a , the large - scale m87 radio halo .",
    "our images clearly show that the halo is a complex and active object .",
    "comparison of our data to recent x - ray images shows that the radio - loud and x - ray - loud plasmas are interacting strongly in the core of the virgo cluster .",
    "simple energetics shows that the input to the region , from the active nucleus in m87 , exceeds radiative losses at the present epoch .",
    "we thus arrive at a new picture of m87 and the virgo cluster .",
    "we find a competition for dominance between the slow , cooling - driven inflow of the hot cluster gas , and the violent outflow of energy from the black hole in the galactic nucleus . at present",
    "the black hole appears to be winning in the inner region of the system .",
    "the detailed processes taking place on scales from a few kpc to 40 kpc are likely to arise from this complex competition . however , both the timescales we have derived and the general wisdom about radio galaxy lifetimes suggest that the current outflow is likely to be transient .",
    "if the agn activity diminishes or stops altogether , then the physical processes which can create a cooling flow would dominate",
    ". it may be that m87 , like other central active galaxies in cooling cores , has gone through several heating / cooling cycles during its lifetime .",
