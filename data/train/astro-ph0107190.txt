    "several years ago we proposed @xcite a combined scenario which explained self - consistently the star - to - star abundance variations of c , n , o , na , al and mg in globular cluster red giants ( gcrgs ) . this scenario has two components : a `` deep mixing '' ( or `` evolutionary '' ) and a `` primordial '' one .",
    "the deep mixing component demonstrates that the overabundances of n , na and al correlating with the deficiencies of c and o can be produced inside the gcrgs themselves via the hydrogen - shell burning in the concurrent cno- , nena- , and mgal - cycles .",
    "it requires that some extra - mixing bridges the outer wing of the h - burning shell ( hbs ) with the base of the convective envelope ( bce ) .",
    "the decline of [ c / fe ] with decreasing @xmath3 in m92 red giants reported for the first time by @xcite and confirmed recently by @xcite is convincing evidence of deep mixing in gcrgs .",
    "moreover , @xcite have shown that extra - mixing resulting in considerable changes of the surface c , n and li abundances in low - metallicity field red giants is rather the rule than the exception .",
    "however , in order to reproduce the large ( @xmath4dex ) variations of [ al / fe ] \\equiv \\log_{10}(n({\\rm a})/n({\\rm b}))_{\\rm star } - \\log_{10}(n({\\rm a})/n({\\rm b}))_\\odot$ ] , where @xmath5 is the number density of species a ] and the o - al anticorrelation in @xmath6  cen red giants found by @xcite we assumed _ ( i ) _ that the initial abundance of @xmath7 mg had been increased up to [ @xmath7mg / fe]=1.1 primordially , and _",
    "( ii ) _ that the rate of the reaction @xmath0al@xmath1(p,@xmath8si , which leads to @xmath2al via @xmath2si(@xmath9al , was @xmath10 times faster than that given by @xcite .",
    "the first assumption  being the primordial component of our combined scenario  was supported by our accepted model of globular clusters self - enrichment . in this model ( based on the earlier ones of @xcite and @xcite ) type ii supernovae",
    "are considered to enrich globular clusters with fe and @xmath11-elements ( e.g. @xmath12o and @xmath13 mg ) , and intermediate - mass ( @xmath14=3 - 8@xmath15 ) asymptotic giant branch stars ( hereafter , i m  agb stars ) with @xmath16 mg and , to a lesser extent , with na and al .",
    "the second assumption concerning the @xmath0al@xmath1(p,@xmath8si reaction was permissible because the uncertainty factor in this rate was as large as @xmath17 @xcite at that time , at least for typical h - shell burning temperatures .    since the publication of paper  i the following important results related to the problem of the origin of the o - na and o - al anticorrelations in gcrgs have been obtained : _",
    "( i ) _ the globular cluster self - enrichment model has received new observational support @xcite and has been developed further by @xcite ; _ ( ii ) _ detailed calculations of nucleosynthesis in i m  agb stars of low metallicities have confirmed our earlier conclusion about their ability to produce considerable amounts of @xmath7 mg and @xmath0 mg @xcite ; _ ( iii ) _ a compilation of new thermonuclear reaction rates ( nacre ) has been published @xcite ; the new rate for the @xmath0al@xmath1(p,@xmath8si reaction is constrained much tighter , with an upper limit of only @xmath1850 times that of @xcite at the temperatures relevant to the outer wing of the hbs in gcrgs ( @xmath19=40 - 50@xmath20  k ) ; _ ( iv ) _ in addition to @xmath6  cen the observations by @xcite provided a second cluster ",
    "m4  for which four abundance correlations ( the o - na , o - al , c - o and c - n ones ) have been observed simultaneously for a number of red giants , and also in this cluster al is found to be strongly overabundant ; _ ( v ) _ quite recently the o - na anticorrelation ( and , possibly , also the o - al one , both seen before only in gcrgs ) has been detected in stars below the main - sequence turn - off ( msto ) in the cluster ngc6752 @xcite .",
    "@xcite have proposed an interpretation for these latter observations : they have taken advantage of the globular clusters self - enrichment model and their finding that at very low metallicity the so - called hot bottom burning , i.e.  thermonuclear processing at the bce , in i m  agb models occurs at @xmath21  k ; @xcite emphasize that at such high temperatures o should be depleted and na enhanced , therefore they infer that the o - na anticorrelation in gcrgs most likely is a consequence of accretion of material lost by i m  agb stars of a previous generation by low - mass ms stars ( i.e.  a pure primordial effect ) .",
    "work is in preparation ( denissenkov & weiss 2001 , in preparation ) to examine this hypothesis with detailed models and within the framework of our own approach for solving the abundance anomalies .    while the first two new results support the ideas of paper  i , fact _",
    "( iii ) _ is in clear contradiction to our original combined scenario which required that the critical reaction rate for @xmath0al@xmath1(p,@xmath8si was set to the highest possible value .",
    "therefore , we modify our scenario in the present _ letter _ in such a way that it agrees with the new experimental results listed above , for example that it can explain the observations concerning m4 as well . to anticipate our main result",
    ", we find that the al - anomalies observed can not be understood in terms of the stable isotope @xmath2al , but can be explained self - consistently and naturally within the deep mixing scenario if they are due to @xmath0al ( in ground state ) .",
    "in this section we will present new models concerning the abundance anomalies in @xmath6  cen and m4 . the method and details of the calculations ( both of the evolutionary models and of the nucleosynthesis )",
    "have been described elsewhere ( e.g.  in paper  i ) and will not be repeated here .",
    "we just recall the important fact that the deep mixing and nucleosynthesis calculations are done on background models obtained from interpolation of the envelope and h - shell structure of several selected sequences of full stellar evolution models .",
    "the models have mass ( @xmath22 ) and initial chemical composition appropriate for the two clusters ( @xmath23 for @xmath6  cen and @xmath24 for m4 ) .",
    "the deep mixing is assumed to be of diffusive nature and is characterized by two parameters : mixing depth and speed ( expressed as a diffusion constant ) .",
    "the difference to our earlier work is the use of the new nacre @xcite rates . concerning the al - nucleosynthesis , we fully take into account the two states of @xmath0al ( ground and metastable state indicated by additional superscripts `` g '' resp .",
    "`` m '' ) and treat them as two independent species in our network .",
    "the new nacre - rate of the reaction @xmath0al@xmath1(p,@xmath8si is not fast enough for producing @xmath2al ( the @xmath25-decay product of @xmath2si ) in gcrgs even if its upper limit ( approximately a factor 50 above the given rate ) was used .",
    "almost all initial @xmath7 mg , whose abundance is assumed to be increased primordially , is transformed into @xmath0al@xmath1 which in turn decays to @xmath0 mg rather than captures protons to produce @xmath2al .",
    "this implies that our combined scenario presented in paper  i is no longer feasible , since it worked only due to the fact that it was possible at that time to increase the proton capture rate by a factor of 1000 .",
    "figure  [ hshell ] illustrates the abundance profiles due to proton - capture nucleosynthesis within a red giant model typical for @xmath6  cen .",
    "we point out to the reader that the abundance of @xmath0al@xmath1 rises steeply in layers farther outside the shell than does @xmath2al , with a peak abundance almost half a magnitude larger .",
    "it is important to emphasize that we used all nacre reaction rates as published without changing them within the possible error limits .",
    "this offers the attractive possibility to explain the o - al anticorrelation in gcrgs by assuming that the observed variations of [ al / fe ] are in fact manifestations of the surface @xmath0al@xmath1 abundance variations produced by deep mixing ! in figs .",
    "[ omcennacre ] and [ m4nacre ] we illustrate that _ all known abundance variations and correlations _ can be explained simultaneously both for @xmath6  cen and m4 , with parameters for the deep mixing which are similar but not identical for the two clusters .",
    "it is also shown that the prediction for @xmath2al clearly fails to reproduce the observations .",
    "given this , the question arises why the obvious possibility that the observed al is actually the isotope @xmath0al has not been tried before ?",
    "one reason might be that @xmath0al is unstable against @xmath26-decay to @xmath0 mg ( emitting the famous 1.8  mev @xmath27-line ) with a life - time of @xmath28  yrs ; therefore the survival of this isotope at the surface over the much longer lifetime of a red giant might appear unlikely",
    ". however , within the deep mixing scenario this argument does not hold necessarily .",
    "indeed , the following simple estimate supports our hypothesis :    the typical size of the radiative zone between the hbs and the bce in gcrgs is @xmath29=1 - 2@xmath30 . for a deep mixing rate ( a diffusion constant ) of @xmath31 @xmath32s@xmath33 , with which the four abundance correlations in the globular clusters @xmath6  cen and m4 are reproduced simultaneously ( figs .  2 and 3 )",
    ", the extra - mixing turnover time is @xmath34 years .",
    "this is comparable with the life - time ( @xmath35 years ) of @xmath0al@xmath1 .",
    "hence , part of the freshly synthesized @xmath0al@xmath1 can survive the transport from the hbs to the bce .",
    "our detailed deep mixing calculations confirm this simple estimate ( figs .",
    "2b and 3b ) .",
    "it should be noted that in spite of the rather long life - time of stars on the rgb ( @xmath36 years for gcrgs ) the surface @xmath0al@xmath1 abundance may be growing steadily ( its absolute value reaching @xmath37=9.4@xmath38@xmath39 in fig .  2b , solid line ) because during all this time we have an active source of @xmath0al@xmath1 at the bottom of the deep mixing zone and assume continuing deep mixing .",
    "some increase of the @xmath2al abundance occurs only later on ( fig .  2b , dashed line ) .",
    "the presence of s - process elements in @xmath6  cen and m4 red giants @xcite implies that agb stars did contribute to the abundance anomalies seen in gcrgs .",
    "we have used this to argue for a primordial enhancement of @xmath7 mg in the models presented in the previous section .",
    "similarily , the correlating c , n , na and o abundance variations in stars below or around the msto in some globular clusters @xcite are apparent signs of primordial pollution or accretion and not the result of deep mixing , which we assume to happen only in evolved red giants .",
    "@xcite have suggested that these anomalies are the result of nucleosynthesis in and pollution by an earlier generation of i m  agb stars .",
    "we will investigate this idea elsewhere ( denissenkov & weiss 2001 , in prepartion ) .",
    "here we propose an alternative interpretation of the o - na ( and o - al ) anticorrelation in stars below the msto in ngc6752 which does not preclude deep mixing in gcrgs but instead takes advantage of it : we assume that some ms dwarfs in globular clusters might accrete material lost by red giant primary components of close binary systems during the so - called common envelope event @xcite .",
    "if these red giants had experienced deep mixing before they filled their roche - lobes then their ejected envelopes could be enriched in na and al and be deficient in o. potentially any primary with 0.8@xmath40@xmath41@xmath402.5 can play a rle in this scenario because in such stars the hbs erases the molecular weight discontinuity left behind by the bce ( which is thought to prevent deep mixing from operating ) before these stars will reach the rgb tip .",
    "forced by new and better constrained proton - nucleosynthesis reaction rates we modified our combined ( primordial plus deep - mixing ) scenario ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper  i ) and reinvestigated the results of deep mixing between the convective envelope and the hydrogen - burning shell in gcrgs .",
    "we found that quite naturally , _ all _ ( anti-)correlations in @xmath6  cen and m4 can be explained simultaneously if the observed al - isotope is in fact the unstable @xmath0al@xmath42 one .",
    "this is possible only within the deep mixing scenario and in fact necessitates ongoing exchange of matter between the @xmath0al@xmath42-source in the shell and the convective envelope . as the primordial component we have ( as before ) to assume an enrichment in @xmath7 mg by pollution with i m  agb debris .",
    "anomalies found around the msto clearly can not be explained within our scenario and require additional ( primordial ) sources for which we tentatively suggest common - envelope effects in close binaries , where the donor star has experienced deep mixing .    to verify our explanation for the al - anomalies in gcrgs one could either try to identify the isotope ratios of al or make use of the @xmath27-line emitted during the decay of @xmath0al@xmath42 (",
    "@xmath0al@xmath43 is present only in vanishing amounts ) .",
    "estimates have shown that the @xmath27-flux from @xmath6  cen is expected to be of order @xmath44  photons/@xmath45sec and therefore 2 orders of magnitude below the comptel detection limit , but might be within reach of the planned `` advanced comptel telescope '' . however , we hope that the ingenuity of observers might lead to the identification of the al - isotope to clarify this question",
