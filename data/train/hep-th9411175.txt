    "in 1949 w.  eherenberg and r.  e.  siday @xcite discussed the effects of electromagnetic vector potentials on the phases of quantum mechanical wave functions .",
    "ten years later , y.  aharonov and d.  bohm @xcite analyzed , from a theoretical point of view , the physical consequences of the introduction in the empty space of an infinite solenoid whose radius tends asymptotically to zero while the total flux of the magnetic field inside it is kept constant .",
    "one of the results of this work was the anticipation of the phenomenon of interference ( later called aharonov - bohm effect ) that occurs when two coherent electron beams pass by each side of a very long , very tiny solenoid and are subsequently recollected .",
    "furthermore , the ab scattering of a plane wave by such a flux tube ( a vortex - like magnetic potential ) was studied in the same work and the scattering amplitude found for every value of the scattering angle @xmath0 except the forward direction where it seemed to diverge . in the following years , the aharonov - bohm problem became very popular because of its physical and philosophical implications on the ( discussed ) reality of the electromagnetic potentials @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the ab interaction is re - encountered in other fields of physics : its planar dynamics reappears in the chern - simons electrodynamics of two interacting point - like particles @xcite , and in the quantized hall effect @xcite . in @xmath1-dimensional gravity , the scattering of a particle on a cone ( closely related to the scattering by infinite cosmic strings ) has been shown to be formally equivalent to the particle - vortex system @xcite .    in spite of the fact that the time - independent quantum mechanical scattering theory for the ab problem has been investigated by many different approaches , only very few works on the time - dependent scattering appear in literature @xcite . here",
    "we carry out the analysis of what happens to a localized wave packet with generic impact parameter when it is scattered by a magnetic vortex . as a new result ,",
    "we show that there are no discontinuities in the time - dependent wave function and that an `` auto - interference '' effect occurs in the forward direction . owing to this phenomenon",
    ", the probability density current of the transmitted wave packet varies dramatically according to the values of the magnetic flux ; for example , in case of odd half - integer values it practically vanishes ( for the stationary case see @xcite ) .",
    "it thus seems that the ab problem does not satisfy the usual definition of `` scattering '' so that , as it will be later shown , a plane wave description of the incident flux no longer succeeds in describing correctly the physics in the forward direction .    in quantum mechanical schrdinger theory ,",
    "the time - evolution of the wave function @xmath2 , representing the physical system , is governed by @xmath3 the hamiltonian @xmath4 in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath5 is @xmath6 thanks to the cylindrical symmetry of the ab set - up , one can reduce the analysis to a two dimensional problem , disregarding the coordinative along the solenoid axis .",
    "if @xmath7 is the flux of the magnetic field @xmath8 @xmath9 then the particle - vortex interaction is described by means of the following vector potential , diverging at the origin of the xy - plane , @xmath10 with @xmath11 and the magnetic field is expressed by a delta - function @xmath12 the solution of ( [ schr ] ) with a certain initial condition is formally given in terms of the aharonov - bohm propagator @xmath13 @xmath14 the kernel @xmath13 can be evaluated using a basis @xmath15 in the hilbert space @xmath16 of the wave functions ; for example @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath19 .",
    "then , setting the initial time @xmath20 , depend upon the choice of the particular gauge for @xmath21 only through a phase factor . for a suitable choice of the gauge it is also possible to make the vector potential `` disappear '' altogether from ( [ hami ] )",
    "; in this case , however , the non - trivial boundary conditions that must be satisfied by functions in @xmath16 prevent ( [ schr ] ) from being the equation describing the non - interacting case . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we shall choose the gauge in which @xmath21 is expressed by ( [ vpot ] ) and the angular momentum operator ( z - component ) by @xmath22 ; this implies that the kernel @xmath13 and the wave function @xmath23 are single - valued ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "] @xmath24 after performing the integration in the linear momentum @xmath25 and replacing @xmath26 by @xmath27 , the propagator appears as a sum over the angular momentum eigenvalues @xmath28 it is also possible to evaluate the propagator using path - integral techniques over multiply - connected spaces ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we shall first suppose that the particle at the initial time @xmath29 is described by a ( normalized ) gaussian wave packet centered in @xmath30 , with an average wave vector @xmath31 , that is with a vanishing impact parameter ( @xmath32 ) @xmath33 then , the propagating wave function is given by @xmath34    a rough estimate for the spatial and kinematical extensions of the gaussian packet is given by the corresponding variances    @xmath35    and the condition of minimal uncertainty holds @xmath36    in a typical experimental set - up for non relativistic electrons , we can assume that the particle is very well localized around @xmath30 at a macroscopical distance from the scatterer @xmath37 so that @xmath38 and @xmath39 therefore @xmath40 the request that the spreading of the wave function is negligible during the whole experiment is translated into @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the total length of the particle flight from its source to the detector .    in the present experiment @xmath43 ; when @xmath44 , the condition of negligible spreading is thus seen to be largely fulfilled .",
    "in this situation , the wave packet remains localized along the direction of motion and all together propagates with group velocity @xmath45 .",
    "after it passes the origin , its peak will be found at a distance @xmath46 from the scatterer when @xmath47 therefore , we shall assume that @xmath48    finally , simple arguments suggest us to look at the integral ( [ wavefun ] ) as if the integration were in fact restricted to values of @xmath49 such that ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 are both positive ) @xmath52\\otimes[\\pi-\\varepsilon,\\pi+\\varepsilon]\\ ] ] with @xmath50 the same order of magnitude as @xmath53 and @xmath51 as @xmath54 . outside these limits",
    "the gaussian function causes the integrand to vanish . as a consequence @xmath55",
    "hence we shall replace the exact expression of the propagator by its asymptotic approximation in the limit @xmath56 .",

    "we have thus separated the propagator into three parts , according to their positive , negative or zero angular momentum eigenvalues respectively .",
    "it is possible to turn these sums into integrals , exploiting appropriate properties of the bessel functions @xcite .",
    "for example , ( [ tardi ] ) becomes @xmath70 where we set the constant of integration to zero because the positive order bessel functions in the series vanish at the origin .",
    "next , split the integration in @xmath69 as follows @xmath71 with @xmath72 where the superscript ( 1 ) denotes that the expressions refer to @xmath69 .",
    "correspondingly @xmath73      the integral @xmath76 is known @xcite ; however , since @xmath67 ranges over a @xmath77-interval , we have to generalize the solution available for a @xmath78-interval .",

    "performing an analysis similar to that one of the previous section , it is also easy to show that , in the case of negligible spreading , the branch number @xmath79 is to be set to zero unless the impact parameter @xmath147 is close to the spatial variance @xmath53 of the initial wave packet ; that is , the auto - interference effect is not noteworthy unless the `` overlap '' between the incoming localized wave packet and the source of the potential ( the origin ) is relevant .",
    "therefore , if @xmath163 the initial wave packet can be considered to propagate freely ( still taking the overall phase factor that accounts for the presence of the magnetic vector potential @xcite ) .",
    "the time - dependent analysis of the aharonov - bohm problem points out that along the forward direction an auto - interference effect occurs between the components of the incoming wave packet that have positive and negative eigenvalues of the angular momentum respectively or , more intuitively , that `` pass '' to the right or to the left of the solenoid .",
    "one can split the wave function in these two parts ( see also @xcite ) @xmath164 the superposition of these two components generates the `` differential cross section '' when the scattering angle is far from the forward direction , while in this direction ( and in a neighborhood of it ) also the auto - interference effect becomes evident , deeply modifying the probability density current and the shape of the transmitted wave packet .",
    "therefore it seems that the classical definitions of differential and total cross section are no longer meaningful in the ab set - up .    on the other hand ,",
    "the time - dependent wave function is continuous and single - valued and reduces to the free - propagating wave packet when its impact parameter is larger than its spatial extension ( that is just the classical result ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the `` differential cross section '' does not diverge along the forward direction .",
    "furthermore , the time - dependent wave function can not be reduced to a superposition of stationary eigenfunctions ( multiplied by the corresponding temporal phase factors ) @xmath165 such as @xmath166 with @xmath167 and not even if phase factors are to be introduced in the `` plane '' wave .",
    "finally , we wish to remark that the introduction of the branch number in the angular variable , responsible in our discussion for the single - valuedness of the propagator , has also been considered through a time - independent approach in a recent work @xcite ."
