    "it has long been recognized ( brown , 1971 ; brown and emslie , 1988 ; johns and lin , 1992 ) that even spatially integrated spectra @xmath0 of flare hard x - ray ( hxr ) collisional bremsstrahlung bursts carry crucial information on flare electron acceleration , transport , and energy budget .",
    "even the absence of spectral features , such as in an ( energy - scale - free ) pure power - law , is likely to indicate stochastic multi - scale processes . on the other hand ,",
    "any features which exist in the acceleration spectrum are smeared out in the propagation and radiation process so that any features detected in @xmath0 have potentially very strong implications for the propagation ( kontar et al , 2003 ) and acceleration processes , and for the electron energy budget in terms of any low energy cut - off .",
    "the large data base of high resolution spectra from the rhessi mission ( lin et al , 2002 ) has made possible a thorough search for such special hxr spectral diagnostic properties .",
    "care has to be taken , however , not to misinterpret features as entirely real solar ones , such as the @xmath1 kev electron spectral feature in the july 23 , 2002 event ( piana et al , 2003 ) .",
    "this can be attributed partly to pulse pile - up at the high count rate in this event .",
    "two approaches are used in interpreting @xmath0 data .",
    "one is to adopt a parametric form for the mean radiation source electron spectrum ( or for the electron injection spectrum ) and predict @xmath0 , using an accurate bremsstrahlung cross - section @xmath2 , and search for the best fit in the model parameter space .",
    "this is commonly done using a source - mean flux spectra @xmath3 containing an isothermal maxwellian , @xmath4 , defined by an emission measure @xmath5 and temperature @xmath6 , plus a non - thermal @xmath7 parameterized as a single or double power - law with a sharp low energy cut - off , @xmath8 ( holman et al , 2003 ) .",
    "such best fits tend to yield an @xmath9 kev , well above @xmath10 kev , but with @xmath5 large enough that @xmath8 is buried in the @xmath4 tail and it is impossible to be sure whether @xmath7 has an actual cut off or blends smoothly with @xmath11 , especially if there is some spread in @xmath6 .",
    "recently , schwartz et al ( 2003 ) have reported , for the august 20 , 2002 flare that a best fit requires an @xmath12 kev in @xmath7 seen clearly above the isothermal best fit @xmath4 . to evaluate whether such a real feature",
    "/ cut - off is demanded by the data , as opposed to simply being compatible with it , it is essential to adopt a non - parametric approach to interpreting @xmath0 - i.e. to infer from @xmath0 what range of functions @xmath13 allows a statistically acceptable fit to @xmath0 .",
    "this inverse / inferential approach has been adopted , developed and applied to data by a number of authors ( craig and brown 1986 , johns and lin , 1992 ; thomson et al . , 1992 ; piana et al , 2003 ; kontar et al , 2004 ; kontar et al , 2005 ) .    in this paper",
    "we apply one of the best available inversion algorithms of kontar et al ( 2004 ) to several events we have found in the rhessi database to show real gaps or dips in @xmath14 probably demanded by , and not just consistent with , the data .",
    "the proposed implications of these results for flare electron acceleration , propagation , and energy budget are briefly discussed .",
    "in this section we generalize to arbitrary cross - section @xmath15 discussions of bremsstrahlung spectrum constraints for models discussed earlier by various authors .",
    "following brown ( 1971 ) and brown , emslie and kontar ( 2003 ) we emphasize that the electron distribution function which can be inferred from @xmath0 without source model assumptions ( apart from optical thinness and isotropy ) is the density weighted mean radiation source electron flux spectrum @xmath13 ( electrons @xmath16 s@xmath17 kev@xmath17 ) defined by @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the local electron flux spectrum and source proton density at position @xmath21 in radiating volume @xmath22 with mean target proton density @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath13 uniquely defines the bremsstrahlung spectrum at the earth by @xmath24 where @xmath15 is the cross - section differential in @xmath25 ( haug , 1997 ) . in general @xmath15",
    "should include angle averaging to allow for anisotropy of the electron distribution function .",
    "the only correction we do not discuss explicitly here is for photospheric back scatter , though it might be important for our results .",
    "the general approach to equation ( [ def ] ) is to treat it as an integral equation to reconstruct @xmath13 from @xmath0 by deconvolution through @xmath15 using regularization techniques e.g. ( craig and brown , 1986 ; kontar et al , 2004 ) .",
    "limitations can be placed on @xmath0 for a physically acceptable solution of ( [ def ] ) to exist . in particular , generalizing ( brown and emslie , 1988 ) , @xmath26}{d\\epsilon } = - { \\bar n v}\\left.{\\bar f(e ) \\epsilon q(\\epsilon , e)\\,\\over 4\\pi r^2 } \\right|_{e=\\epsilon}+\\cr\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; + { { \\bar n v } \\over 4\\pi r^2 } \\int_\\epsilon ^\\infty   \\bar f(e ) \\ ,",

    "\\label{inequality}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since any physical @xmath13 should be nonnegative and since @xmath27 @xmath28 for the relativistic cross - section of haug , ( 1997 ) , we immediately have that @xmath29 , @xmath28 .",
    "it is useful to consider the shape of @xmath0 in terms of the local spectral index @xmath30 defined by @xmath31 ( note that definition ( @xmath32 ) does not correspond to @xmath33 except for constant @xmath34 ( conway et al , 2003 ) ) . then in terms of the spectral index the condition @xmath35 can be expressed @xmath36 i.e. any bremsstrahlung emission spectrum @xmath0 should decrease with a logarithmic gradient larger than @xmath37 .",
    "if the condition ( [ gamma1 ] ) is violated then the spectrum @xmath0 is not from an optically thin bremsstrahlung source .    to date",
    "no hxr spectrum from a solar flare violating condition ( [ gamma1 ] ) has ever been reported , so there is no challenge to the belief that flare hxr burst spectra are consistent with optically thin bremsstrahlung . however",
    ", more stringent spectral compatibility conditions apply to specific models of how @xmath38 is formed from an injection spectrum @xmath39 .",
    "a _ thick target _ is a source in which electrons injected into the source decelerate to rest under the action of energy loss processes , within the observed integration time and volume .",
    "the terminology thick is similar to optical depth , a thick target being a medium where plasma electron column density is sufficient to stop energetic electrons , or , equally , the mean free path of the fast electrons is much less than the system length .",
    "in other words , for energy loss cross section @xmath40 , @xmath41 within the column density @xmath42 of @xmath22 at all @xmath43 of interest . the resulting mean electron flux spectrum is then the density - weighted average of the flux spectrum of the electrons along their energy loss path @xmath44 , as governed by @xmath45 for all the energy loss processes involved .",
    "the assumptions in inferring @xmath39 from the total @xmath46 are that : ( a ) the bremsstrahlung emission from acceleration region can be neglected , and ( b ) physically distinct acceleration and target ( deceleration ) regions exist .",
    "let us consider the motion for an electron in the target from an injection spectrum @xmath39 ( @xmath47 ) for a given background plasma density profile @xmath48 , and introduce the column depth @xmath49 of the plasma so that @xmath50 .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath44 is an electron path .",
    "therefore , a column depth can be also defined as @xmath51 . comparing with the original thick target model ( brown , 1971 ) where only collisional losses have been taken into account we get , for that case @xmath52 where @xmath53",
    ", @xmath54 is the electron charge , and @xmath55 is the coulomb logarithm .    assuming that we can find the solution of the equation of motion of an electron in the form @xmath56 we can write down the mean electron flux in the following form @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the injected area .",
    "the evolving electron spectrum @xmath59 can then be expressed in terms of the initial or injected electron spectrum using the continuity equation @xmath60 .",
    "after the change of variables @xmath61 in ( [ fbar1 ] ) one has for the mean electron spectrum with arbitrary energy losses .",
    "@xmath62 ( the mean electron flux given by ( [ fbar2 ] ) makes use of deterministic electron propagation ignoring collective and diffusion effects ) . in previous papers ( brown and mackinnon , 1985 )",
    "it was also assumed that the upper limit in the integral ( [ fbar2 ] ) is infinity , for any non - collisional losses described by the equation of the type @xmath63 e.g. @xmath64 , which is true for purely collisional losses .",
    "equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ fbar2 ] ) become @xmath65      we now consider the case of a purely collisional thick target ( [ fbar3 ] ) , when the injection spectrum takes the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the spectral index of the density weighted mean electron flux distribution . from equation ( [ f0 ] )",
    "it follows that , for a photon spectrum @xmath0 to be produced by a purely collisional thick target with a physical ( nonnegative ) injection spectrum @xmath68 , the mean electron flux @xmath69 derived from the photon spectrum @xmath0 must have a logarithmic slope @xmath70 ( or @xmath71 ) .    in the next section",
    "we report rhessi @xmath0 data in which the above condition appears to be violated , and a purely collisional thick target interpretation is impossible .",
    "equation ( [ fbar3 ] ) also explicitly says that if the injected spectrum @xmath39 has a low energy cut - off at energy @xmath72 , then the purely collisional thick target mean spectrum @xmath69 can have a spectral index @xmath73 , for @xmath74 i.e. a logarithmic slope of @xmath75 ) which is the lowest @xmath76 value that can be explained by a collisional thick target .",
    "however , if the spectral index at some point is less than -1 , then condition ( [ delta ] ) is violated , and non - collisional models must be involved .",
    "there are flares observed by rhessi ( lin et al , 2002 ) with unusually flat photon spectra resulting in peculiar mean electron distribution functions @xmath77 . unlike the july 23 , 2002 flare ( piana et al , 2003 ) , in these flares the count rate in the front segments of the rhessi detectors were too low for pulse pile - up ( smith et al , 2002 ) to be important .",
    "forward fits applied to this data show that the x - ray spectra can be best fitted by a broken power - law with a low energy cutoff in the range between 15 and 35 kev .",
    "this suggests that there are no injected nonthermal electrons in the range below a few tens of kev . to verify this we used a recently developed regularization algorithm ( kontar et al .",
    "2004 ) to infer model - free electron spectra for these events .",
    "the mean electron flux spectrum inferred shows a clear dip at energies between 15 and 35 kev .",
    "a similar feature , though less clear and at the energies around @xmath1kev , has been recovered by piana et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "the main results are presented in fig 1 - 3 .",
    "the observed spectrum of the flare is the convolution of the cross - section and mean electron flux .",
    "the problem of inferring the mean electron spectrum is ill - posed ( craig and brown , 1986 ) .",
    "thus , one has to avoid unphysical behaviour in @xmath78 using some constraints .",
    "this process is called regularization .    to infer the mean electron spectrum we used the following recently developed regularization algorithm of kontar et al , ( 2004 )    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is a regularization parameter",
    ", @xmath81 is a regularizing first order derivative operator , and @xmath82 is the matrix representation of the cross - section operator @xmath58 in @xmath83 i.e. comprises binned integral components @xmath84 . for our calculations we used the haug ( 1997 ) cross - section .",
    "one should note that if we try to infer the electron spectra without additional constraints , e.g. setting to zero the penalty term in eq .",
    "[ mproblem ] , the resulting @xmath85 would be a violently oscillating function .",
    "such unphysical results come from the ill - posedness of the problem , since small noise perturbations in @xmath0 will be strongly amplified .      for our analysis",
    "we have selected three flares with unusually flat local spectra .",
    "the data reduction has been performed in the same way as in kontar et al ( 2005 ) .",
    "then the regularization algorithm has been applied to find the mean electron flux and its spectral index .",
    "figures 1 - 3 show flat mean electron flux spectra with a positive derivative in the range 15 - 35 kev .",
    "the depth of the dip and the resulting electron spectral index is different from flare to flare , though qualitatively similar .",
    "the april 25 event ( figure 1 ) has a dip at 19 kev but the error bars do not allow us to conclude that this dip is real .",
    "( upper panel ) , mean electron flux @xmath3 and electron spectral index @xmath86 ( lower panel ) for 25 april 2002  05:55  ut flare using first order regularization .",
    "the photon spectrum has been accumulated over the impulsive phase of the flare.,width=453 ]    the confidence intervals on the regularized solution and spectral index ( figures 1 - 3 ) have been calculated as a maximum deviation from the solution in a set of 30 random realizations of photon data within a @xmath87 range . the distribution of errors has been discussed in piana et al 2003 ; kontar et al , 2004 . to allow for instrumental uncertainties ,",
    "@xmath88 was taken to be not less than @xmath89 of the photon flux , and thus can be treated as an upper estimate of the error .    the august 2002 ( figure 2 )",
    "flare shows an extremely clear gap around @xmath90 kev in the mean electron flux .",
    "forward - fit to the data shows an unambiguous low energy cut - off at @xmath91 kev ( kasparova et al , 2005 ) . to verify the reality of this feature",
    ", we used different orders of regularization for the inversion of the corresponding flare x - ray spectra .",
    "all zero , first , and second order regularization methods produce the dip ( figure 2 ) .",
    "figure 3 also shows that at least three successive points have @xmath76 less than @xmath92 with @xmath93 confidence and 4 points less than zero .",
    "the former suggests that the thick - target model is unacceptable while the latter indicates a low energy cut - off in the injected electron spectrum .",
    "though we have used the @xmath88 criterion , the result is much more significant than that @xmath94 of a single @xmath88 deviation since there are three successive such deviations .",
    "while a more rigorous statistical analysis is necessary , this should be significant at roughly the level of @xmath95 or about @xmath96 which makes it highly suggestive at least .",
    "our analysis of the observed photon spectra shows features that have not been observed before .",
    "johns and lin ( 1992 ) reported the downturn of the derived electron spectrum for earlier balloon data , though the errors were too big to be conclusive . in the results presented in this paper we are much more confident that a dip in the electron distribution is required by the photon spectra , though we caution that the photon spectrum itself is subject to additional corrections for photospheric albedo , directivity , and instrument effects ( smith et al , 2002 ) .",
    "one of the important implications of our result if upheld is related to the accelerated spectrum @xmath39 .",
    "as can be seen from the results , the photon spectra require a low energy cut - off in the injected spectra @xmath39 to be produced , e.g. the absence of electrons in the range below 20 - 30 kev .",
    "this is quite a strong requirement on acceleration models , that often produce extended power law spectra above thermal energies of a few kev .",
    "the cut - off poses physical challenges to electron acceleration and transport since an electron beam with a velocity distribution function such that @xmath97 should be unstable to the generation of plasma waves if @xmath98 .",
    "we stress that , if the existence of a low energy cut - off in the injected electron spectrum @xmath39 is confirmed , its implications for total flare electron power , acceleration and propagation are profound",
    ". moreover , the evidence of a steep turn over in @xmath77 would reject the long - standing collisional transport thick - target model of flare electron propagation ( brown , 1971 ) where the accelerated electron spectrum @xmath39 is modified solely by coulomb collisions along the electron path .",
