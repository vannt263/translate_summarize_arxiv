    "quantum chromodynamics , qcd , is the theory of quarks , gluons and their interactions .",
    "it is central to all modern colliders .",
    "and , for the most part , it is what we are made of .",
    "qcd bears a number of similarities to quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "just as electrons carry the qed charge , i.e. , electric charge , quarks carry the qcd charge , known as colour charge .",
    "whereas there is only one kind of electric charge , colour charge comes in three varieties , sometimes labelled red , green and blue .",
    "anti - quarks have corresponding anti - colour .",
    "the gluons in qcd are a bit like the photons of qed .",
    "but while photons are electrically neutral , gluons are not colour neutral . they can be thought of as carrying both colour charge and anti - colour charge .",
    "there are eight possible different combinations of ( anti)colour for gluons .",
    "another difference between qcd and qed lies in its coupling @xmath0 . in qcd",
    "it is only moderately small , it tends to zero at high momentum scales ( asymptotic freedom , qed does the opposite ) , it blows up at small scales , and in between its evolution with scale is quite fast : at the lhc its value will range from @xmath1 at a scale of @xmath2 , to @xmath3 at a scale of @xmath4 .",
    "these differences between qcd and qed contribute to making qcd a much richer theory .    in these lectures",
    "i will attempt to give you a feel for how qcd works at high momentum scales , and for the variety of techniques used by theorists in order to handle qcd at today s high - energy colliders .",
    "the hope is that these basics will come in useful for day - to - day work with the qcd facets of hadron collider physics . in the fifty or so pages of these lectures",
    ", it will be impossible to give full treatment of any of the topics we will encounter .",
    "for that the reader is referred to any of the classic textbooks about qcd at colliders @xcite .",
    "let us start with a brief reminder of the components of the qcd lagrangian .",
    "this section will be rather dense , but we will return to some of the points in more detail later .",
    "as already mentioned , quarks come in three colours .",
    "so rather than representing them with a single spinor @xmath5 , we will need the spinor to carry also a colour index @xmath6 , which runs from @xmath7 , @xmath8 the quark part of the lagrangian ( for a single flavour ) can be written @xmath9 where the @xmath10 are the usual dirac matrices ; the @xmath11 are gluon fields , with a lorentz index @xmath12 and a colour index @xmath13 that goes from @xmath14 .",
    "quarks are in the fundamental representation of the su(3 ) ( colour ) group , while gluons are in the adjoint representation .",
    "each of the eight gluon fields acts on the quark colour through one of the ` generator ' matrices of the su(3 ) group , the @xmath15 factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lquark ] ) .",
    "one convention for writing the matrices is @xmath16 with @xmath17 @xmath18 by looking at the first of these , together with the @xmath19 term of @xmath20 , one can immediately get a feel for what gluons do : a gluon with ( adjoint ) colour index @xmath21 acts on quarks through the matrix @xmath22 .",
    "that matrix takes green quarks ( @xmath23 ) and turns them into red quarks ( @xmath24 ) , and vice versa . in other words , when a gluon interacts with a quark it",
    "_ repaints _ the colour of the quark , taking away one colour and replacing it with another .",
    "the likelihood with which this happens is governed by the strong coupling constant @xmath25 .",
    "note that the repainting analogy is less evident for some of the other colour matrices , but it still remains essentially correct .",
    "the second part of the qcd lagrangian is purely gluonic @xmath26 where the gluon field tensor @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 =      i f_{abc}t^c}\\,,\\ ] ] where the @xmath29 are the structure constants of su(3 ) ( defined through the commutators of the @xmath30 matrices ) .",
    "note the major difference with qed here , namely the presence of a term @xmath31 with two gluon fields .",
    "the presence of such a term is one of the major differences with qed , and , as we will discuss in more detail below , it will be responsible for the fact that gluons interact directly with gluons .",
    "for now , note simply that it has to be there in order for the theory to be gauge invariant under local su(3 ) transformations : @xmath32 where , in the second line , we have dropped the explicit subscript @xmath33 indices , and the @xmath34 are eight arbitrary real functions of the space - time position @xmath35 .",
    "there are two main first - principles approaches to solving qcd : lattice qcd and perturbative qcd .",
    "the most complete approach is lattice qcd .",
    "it involves discretizing space - time , and considering the values of the quark and gluon fields at all the vertices / edges of the resulting 4-dimensional lattice ( with imaginary time ) . through a suitable monte carlo sampling over all possible field configurations ,",
    "one essentially determines the relative likelihood of different field configurations , and this provides a solution to qcd .",
    "this method is particularly suited to the calculation of static quantities in qcd such as the hadron mass spectrum .",
    "the results of such a lattice calculation are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice - spectrum ] , showing very good agreement .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    lattice methods have been successfully used in a range of contexts , for example , in recent years , in helping extract fundamental quantities such as the ckm matrix ( and limits on new physics ) from the vast array of experimental results on hadron decays and oscillations at flavour factories .",
    "unfortunately lattice calculations are nt suitable in all contexts .",
    "let us imagine , briefly , what would be required in order to carry out lattice calculations for lhc physics : since the centre - of - mass energy is ( will be ) @xmath36 , we need a lattice spacing of order @xmath37 to resolve everything that happens .",
    "non - perturbative dynamics for quarks / hadrons near rest takes place on a timescale @xmath38 . but",
    "hadrons at lhc have a boost factor of up to @xmath39 , so the extent of the lattice should be about @xmath40 .",
    "that tells us that if we are to resolve high - momentum transfer interactions and at the same time follow the evolution of quark and gluon fields up to the point where they form hadrons , we would need about @xmath41 lattice units in each direction , of @xmath42 nodes . not to mention the problem with high particle multiplicities ( current lattice calculations seldom involve more than two or three particles ) and all the issues that relate to the use of imaginary time in lattice calculations",
    "of course , that s not to say that it might not be possible , one day , to find clever tricks that would enable lattice calculations to deal with high - energy reactions .",
    "however , with today s methods , any lattice calculation of the properties of lhc proton ",
    "proton scattering seems highly unlikely . for this reason",
    ", we will not give any further discussion of lattice qcd here , but instead refer the curious reader to textbooks and reviews for more details  @xcite .",
    "perturbative qcd relies on the idea of an order - by - order expansion in a small coupling @xmath43 .",
    "some given observable @xmath44 can then be predicted as @xmath45 where one might calculate just the first one or two terms of the series , with the understanding that remaining ones should be small .",
    "the principal technique to calculate the coefficients @xmath46 of the above series is through the use of feynman diagrammatic ( or other related ) techniques .",

    "it is the fact that gluons carry colour charge that means that they must interact with other gluons . in terms of colour flows",
    ", we have the repetition of the idea that the emission of a gluon can be seen as taking away the colour from the gluon ( or anti - colour ) and replacing it with a different one .",
    "because of the double colour / anti - colour charge of a gluon , one can anticipate that it will interact with ( or emit ) other gluons twice as strongly as does a quark . before coming to mathematical formulation of that statement ,",
    "let s comment also on the 4-gluon vertex of fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman - interactions ] . this comes from the product of two @xmath54 type terms in @xmath55 and is order @xmath56 whereas the two other interactions are order @xmath25 .",

    "we see that the phase space also factorizes .",

    "though derived here in the specific context of @xmath145 production , these soft and collinear divergences are a very general property of qcd and appear whenever a gluon is emitted from a quark , regardless of the process .      if we want to calculate the @xmath146 corrections to the total cross section , the diagrams included in eq .",

    "the production of hadrons must be finite .",
    "the integral over the gluon - emission correction has two non - integrable , logarithmic divergences .",
    "these divergences must therefore somehow be cancelled by corresponding divergences in the virtual term .",
    "this is the requirement of _ unitarity _ , which is basically the statement that probability of anything happening must add up to @xmath149 . the most straightforward way of doing the full calculation for the total cross section is to use dimensional regularization in the phase space integral for the real emission diagram and for the integration over the loop momentum in the virtual diagram .",
    "however , in order just to visualize what is happening one can also write @xmath150 where the first term , @xmath149 , is the ` born ' term , i.e. , the production of just @xmath61 , the second term is the real emission term , and the third term is the loop correction .",
    "since we need to integrate gluon emission beyond the soft and collinear region , we have introduced a function @xmath151 , which parametrizes the deviation of the matrix - element from its soft limit when @xmath152 , with @xmath83 the centre - of - mass energy of the process .",

    "the statement that real and virtual divergences cancel means that @xmath156 should be identical to @xmath153 in the soft or collinear limits @xmath157 thus the corrections to the total cross section come from the region of hard ( @xmath158 ) , large - angle gluons ( for which perturbation theory is valid )",
    ". there s a good reason for this : soft and collinear emission takes place on a time - scale @xmath159 that is long compared to that , @xmath160 , for the production of the @xmath61 pair from the virtual photon .",
    "anything that happens long after the production of the @xmath61 pair can not change the fact that there will be a qcd final state ( though it can change the properties of that final state ) , and so it does not affect the total cross section . similarly , whatever dynamics is involved in effecting the transition between partons and hadrons is also expected to occur on a long time - scale ( @xmath161 ) and so should not modify the total cross section .",
    "this is important because it allows us to neglect the issue that we can not directly compute the properties of hadron production .",
    "the fact that the corrections to the total cross section are dominated by a region of hard gluon emission is reflected in a reasonable behaviour for the perturbative series @xmath162 where we have expressed the result in terms of @xmath0 evaluated at a renormalization @xmath163 and the coefficients correspond to @xmath164 ( for all known terms in the series , including electroweak effects , see refs .",
    "@xcite as well as references therein ) .      as a first step towards asking questions about the final state",
    ", our next exercise is to attempt to determine the mean number of gluons that are emitted from a quark with energy @xmath165 .",
    "if the emission probability is small ( @xmath166 ) then to first order in the coupling the mean number of emitted gluons is equal to the probability of emitting one gluon @xmath167 the integral diverges for @xmath168 and @xmath143 , however , we can reasonably argue that the divergent structure only holds as long as perturbation theory is valid .",

    "this is an active research topic , and here we will just outline the ideas behind two well - established merging tasks : combination of different multiplicity lo matrix elements with parton showers ; and combination of nlo and parton shower predictions .",

    "however , if one showers both @xmath94+parton and @xmath94 + 2-parton events , then one is faced with a double - counting issue , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : me+ps - double - counting ] . in some events ( left )",

    "two main methods exist to avoid this double counting : ckkw matching  @xcite and mlm matching  @xcite .",
    "the latter , named after its inventor , m.  l.  mangano , is the one we will describe here ( it is the simpler of the two ) .",

    "the numbers of events that one generates in the different samples are in proportion to their cross sections with these cuts . * for each tree - level event from these samples , say one with @xmath185 partons , shower it with your favourite parton - shower program . *",

    "in contrast the middle event , which also has two jets above @xmath489 , was generated from a @xmath94 + 2-parton event and is accepted .",
    "so is the leftmost event with only one jet , starting from a @xmath94 + 1-parton event .    by providing a remedy for the double - counting issue , ensuring that the hard jets always come just from the matrix element",
    ", the mlm procedure also ensures that hard jets above @xmath489 have distributions given by the tree - level matrix - element calculations .",
    "the rejection of extra jets also plays another important role : when there are big differences in scales between the jets and @xmath489 ( or between different jets ) , the monte carlo showering would want to ` fill up ' that phase space with emissions . however , whenever it does so , the event gets rejected by the matching procedure . as long as the monte carlo is carrying out a reasonable showering of these multi - parton events ,",
    "then the procedure is equivalent to the introduction of a sudakov form factor encoding the probability of not emitting radiation .",
    "the above ` mlm ' merging of matrix - elements and parton showers ( meps ) is the main procedure available with alpgen , for use with both herwig and pythia . it is also provided ( in a variant form ) within madgraph .",
    "the sherpa monte carlo also has its own matrix - element generator(s ) and provides ` ckkw ' meps matching  @xcite , which instead of the veto steps of mlm matching , uses an analytical calculation of the sudakov form factors . these and other matrix - element / parton - shower merging schemes are discussed in detail in ref .",
    "they all share the feature of a matching scale to separate the region under the ` responsibility ' of matrix elements and that delegated to the parton shower . in all cases physics predictions well above the matching scale",

    "one might think that since we ve had nlo predictions and parton shower predictions for a couple of decades , such a task should not be too hard .",
    "the main difficulty comes from the fact that nlo predictions involve divergent event weights ( cf .",

    "two approaches are in use to get around this problem , the mc@nlo @xcite and powheg  @xcite methods .",

    "the characteristic of these processes is that they are nearly all free of light jets at lo ( except for one of the single - top processes ) , because this simplifies the set of divergences that need to be dealt with .",
    "very recently one pythia  @xcite and a couple of herwig++ processes ( ref .",

    "an alternative to mc@nlo is powheg  @xcite .",
    "it aims to avoid the ( small fraction of ) negative weights that are present in mc@nlo and also seeks to be less tightly interconnected with a specific monte carlo program .",

    "this single - emission monte carlo is designed in such a way as to be sufficient to give the correct nlo result .",

    "right : in a collinear unsafe algorithm such as the ic - pr type cms cone , the splitting of the central hard particle causes the leftmost particle to become the hardest in the event , leading to a two - jet rather than a one - jet event . ]",
    "there is one major drawback to the above procedure : the use of the particles @xmath414 s to decide which one to take as the first seed .",
    "this is problematic , because particle @xmath414 s are not collinear safe quantities . as illustrated in the two right - hand events of fig .",
    "[ fig : coll - unsafety ] , in an ic - pr algorithm , if the hardest particle undergoes a collinear splitting then this can result in another particle in the event becoming the ` new ' hardest particle , giving a different set of final jets as compared to events without the splitting . thus in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : coll - unsafety ] there is a divergent ( real , positive ) contribution to the 2-jet cross section and a separate divergent ( 1-loop virtual , negative ) contribution to the 1-jet cross section .",
    "in contrast , for a collinear - safe algorithm ( two leftmost events ) , the collinear - splitting of the hardest particle does not change the set of final jets .",
    "then the real and virtual divergences both contribute to the 1-jet cross section and so cancel each other .",
    "collinear unsafety means that certain cross sections can not be calculated at nlo ( or sometimes nnlo )  one will only obtain nonsensical infinite answers .",
    "furthermore , even if one is working at some low perturbative order which is not divergent ( e.g. , lo ) , the fact that higher orders diverge means that the convergence of the whole perturbative series becomes questionable , compromising the usefulness even of the low orders .    over the past two decades",
    "there has been significant discussion of such problems .",
    "there are many other variants of cone algorithm , and nearly all suffer from problems either of collinear safety , or infrared safety .",
    "one class that has been widely used at the tevatron avoids the ordering of initial seeds , and instead obtains stable cones using all possible particles as seeds : stable cones are not immediately converted into jets , but instead , once one has the list of the stable cones found by iterating from all possible seeds one then uses a ` split  merge ' procedure to decide how particles that appear in multiple stable cones should be unambiguously assigned to a single jet .     and two hard partons .",
    "the addition of a soft gluon converts the event from having two jets to just one jet .",
    "in contrast to fig .  [",
    "fig : coll - unsafety ] , here the explicit angular structure is shown ( rather than @xmath414 as a function of rapidity ) . ]",
    "this procedure avoids the collinear - safety issue ( the order of particles @xmath414 s no longer matters ) , however , it turns out that it instead introduces an infrared - safety issue : adding an extra soft particle creates a new seed , which can lead to an extra stable cone being found , which feeds through the split  merge procedure , altering the final set of ( hard ) jets .",
    "this tends to happen when two hard particles are separated by a distance @xmath519 that satisfies @xmath520 ( so that a cone centred on either fails to capture the other and each hard particle leads to its own jet ) and one adds a soft particle in between the two ( so that a cone centred on the soft particle includes both hard ones , which then end up in a single jet ) , as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : ir - unsafety ] .",
    "a partial fix for the problem was given in ref .",
    "@xcite ( adopted by the tevatron in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which involves adding extra seeds at the midpoints between all pairs of stable cones and uses those as new starting points for finding additional stable cones before starting the split  merge step .",
    "a full fix involves a non - seed - based approach to exhaustively finding all possible stable cones in an event , in an algorithm known as the seedless infrared safe cone ( siscone )  @xcite .",
    "sequential - recombination jet algorithms take a bottom - up approach to constructing jets , as if they were inverting the sequence of splittings of the parton shower . of course",
    "that sequence does nt really exist unambiguously , since gluon emission is a quantum - mechanical process involving coherent emission from all colour sources in an event .",
    "however , for collinear emissions the picture that there is a single ` emitter ' is not a poor approximation .",
    "the most widely used sequential recombination algorithm to date is the @xmath292 algorithm , originally formulated for @xmath93 events  @xcite .",
    "recall , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fs - universal - splitting ] ) , that the soft and collinear limit of the gluon - emission probability for @xmath521 is @xmath522 where @xmath523 is @xmath524 ( @xmath525 ) if @xmath6 is a gluon ( quark ) , and where we ve written @xmath526 in the denominator to avoid specifying which of @xmath109 and @xmath402 is the soft particle .",
    "the essential idea of the @xmath292 algorithm is to define a ` distance measure ' @xmath527 between every pair of particles @xmath528 , @xmath529 in the collinear limit , @xmath527 reduces to @xmath530 , which is the relative transverse momentum between particles @xmath109 and @xmath402 ( hence the name @xmath292 algorithm ) , normalized to the total visible ( or sometimes centre - of - mass ) energy @xmath83 .",
    "apart from the normalization , this is just what appears in the denominator of the splitting probability , eq .",
    "( [ eq : splitting - again ] ) , so that pairs of particles that would arise from a splitting with a strong divergence are considered very close together .",
    "the algorithm works by identifying the pair of particles that has the smallest @xmath527 and recombining them into a single particle ( also called a ` pseudojet ' ) .",
    "it then recalculates all @xmath527 distances taking into account the new particle , and again recombines the pair that s closest .",
    "the procedure is repeated until all @xmath527 distances are above some threshold @xmath531 , at which point the pseudojets that remain become the event s jets .      for hadron collisions and deep - inelastic scattering , the version of the @xmath292 algorithm that is most commonly used reads as follows  @xcite . for every pair of particles",
    "define a ( dimensionful ) inter - particle distance @xmath532 , @xmath533 where @xmath153 is a parameter whose role is similar to that of @xmath153 in cone algorithms . also define a beam distance for every particle , @xmath534 the algorithm proceeds by searching for the smallest of the @xmath532 and the @xmath535 .",
    "if it is a @xmath532 then particles @xmath109 and @xmath402 are recombined into a single new particle .",
    "if it is a @xmath535 then @xmath109 is removed from the list of particles , and called a jet .",
    "this is repeated until no particles remain .",
    "note that the distance in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dij - kt ] ) just reduces to that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : yij - kt - alg ] ) in the collinear limit ( modulo @xmath224 normalization ) .",
    "so one is still dealing with the relative transverse momentum between pairs of particles . as with cone algorithms , in this ` inclusive longitudinally invariant @xmath292 algorithm , ' arbitrarily soft particles can form jets .",
    "it is therefore standard to place a @xmath536 cutoff on the jets one uses for ` hard ' physics .",
    "one can verify that @xmath153 in the @xmath292 algorithm plays a similar role to @xmath153 in cone algorithms , using the following observations : if two particles @xmath109 and @xmath402 are within @xmath537 of each other , i.e. , @xmath538 , then @xmath539 and so @xmath109 and @xmath402 will prefer to recombine rather than forming separate jets . if a particle @xmath109 is separated by more than @xmath153 from all other particles in the event then it will have @xmath540 for all @xmath402 and so it will form a jet on its own .",

    "the hardest jets all appear circular , as expected given the use of cones in the definition of the algorithm ( in cone algorithms with split  merge steps , the jets are often not circular , because of the less trivial mapping from stable cones to jets ) . for the @xmath292 algorithm ,",
    "the jets have quite irregular ( or jagged ) edges , because many of the soft particles cluster together early in the recombination sequence ( owing to their small @xmath414 and hence @xmath532 ) in patterns that are determined by the random distributions of those particles in @xmath414 and rapidity and azimuth .",
    "the irregularity of the jet boundaries has often been held against the @xmath292 algorithm .",
    "one reason is that it makes it harder to calculate acceptance corrections : for example , if you know that some part of a detector is misbehaving , it is not obvious how far a @xmath292 jet must be from that part of the detector in order not to be affected by it .",
    "another reason relates to the linearity of the dependence of the jet momentum on soft - particle momenta : in the ic - pr algorithm , the hard core of the jet essentially determines the jet boundary , and the algorithm depends linearly on the momenta of any soft particles within the boundary , and is independent of particles outside it . in the @xmath292 algorithm , varying the momentum of one soft particle in the vicinity of the jet core can affect whether it and other soft particles get clustered with that core or not .",
    "this can complicate energy calibrations for the jet algorithm , though techniques exist to correct for this to some extent ( jet - area - based subtraction  @xcite , which leaves just a residual term known as back - reaction  @xcite ) .",
    "a feature of the @xmath292 algorithm that is attractive is that it not only gives you jets , but also assigns a clustering sequence to the particles within the jet .",
    "one can therefore undo the clustering and look inside the jet .",
    "this has been exploited in a range of qcd studies ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and also in discussions of searches of hadronic decays of boosted massive particles such as @xmath376 , @xmath541 , or @xmath94 bosons , top quarks , or new particles ( early examples include refs .  @xcite ; for more recent examples , see the reviews in refs .",
    "jet substructure studies are also often carried out with the cambridge / aachen ( c / a ) algorithm  @xcite , which essentially replaces @xmath542 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dij - kt],[eq : dib - kt ] ) but is otherwise like the @xmath292 algorithm .",
    "it turns out that it is possible to design a sequential - recombination algorithm with many of the nice properties of cone algorithms via a simple modification of the @xmath292 algorithm s distance measures  @xcite :    @xmath543    the correspondence with the divergences of eq .",
    "( [ eq : splitting - again ] ) is partially lost : objects that are close in angle still prefer to cluster early , but that clustering tends to occur with a hard particle ( rather than necessarily involving soft particles ) .",
    "this means that jets ` grow ' in concentric circles out from a hard core , until they reach a radius @xmath153 , giving circular jets just as with the ic - pr cone , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : antikt ] .",
    "however , unlike the ic - pr cone , this ` anti-@xmath292 ' algorithm is collinear ( and infrared ) safe , meaning that it is safe to use with fixed - order qcd predictions .",
    "this , combined with the fact that it has been implemented efficiently in the fastjet jet - finding code  @xcite , has led to it being adopted as the default jet algorithm by both the atlas and cms collaborations .    , but shown for the anti-@xmath292 algorithm ]    note that the anti-@xmath292 algorithm does not provide useful information on jet substructure : if a jet contains two hard cores , then the @xmath292 ( or c / a ) algorithms first reconstruct those hard cores and merge the resulting two subjets",
    ". the anti-@xmath292 algorithm will often first cluster the harder of the two cores and then gradually agglomerate the contents of the second hard core .      because of the intricacies of calibrating jets , past experiments have tended to concentrate their efforts on just one or two jet definitions , which are used across the board for qcd studies , top - quark studies , higgs and new physics searches . typically the choices have been for cone - type algorithms with @xmath153 values in the range 0.40.7 .    at the lhc there are prospects of experimental methods ( for example topoclusters at atlas and particle flow at atlas ) that make it easier to use a broad range of jet definitions .",
    "we ve already mentioned , above , the use of jet substructure in new physics searches .",
    "these methods will definitely benefit from experiments flexibility in choosing different jet definitions ( for example , many of the proposed searches use quite a large jet radius , @xmath544   11.5 ) . more generally , when using jets , it is important to establish what you are trying to get out of the jet algorithm , what it is that you re trying to optimize .",
    "different studies will want to optimize different things .",
