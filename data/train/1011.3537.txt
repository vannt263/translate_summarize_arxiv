    "it was not until a few years ago when the axps , known for their x - ray flux variability and glitches , started showing bursting behaviour . according to the magnetar model ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) , axp outbursts are caused by ns fracturing owing to internal magnetic stresses accompanied by external surface and magnetospheric disturbances .",

    "the xrt data were accumulated in the windowed timing ( wt ) and photon counting ( pc ) mode , however , we considered only the pc mode data which provides full spatial and spectral resolution with a time resolution of 2.5  s. the data were processed using the ftools task _ xrtpipeline _ v0.12.4 . the axp spectra were extracted from a circular region of radius 20 pixels ( 1 pixel=2.36@xmath28 ) encompassing 90% of the encircled energy and the background events were extracted from an annular region of radius between 30 and 50 pixels , centered on the axp .",

    "we created light curves with 100  s bins and the bins with count - rates greater than 0.35 and 0.4 counts  s@xmath9 were rejected for mos1/2 and pn , respectively , thus filtering out spurious and heavy proton flaring events .",

    "the axp spectra were extracted from a 20@xmath28 circular region from mos1/2 and pn encompassing 77% of the encircled energy and the background spectra were extracted from an annular region of radius between 20@xmath28 and 30@xmath28 , centered on the axp .",
    "these extraction radii were chosen to maximize the emission from the pulsar using all three detectors while also avoiding contamination from the surrounding bright snr kes  73 .",
    "we found that a larger extraction radius for the pulsar clearly showed emission lines characteristic of a young snr ( see zhu & kaspi 2010 for their analysis of the pn data in the 410 kev ) , thereby introducing uncertainties in accurately determining the spectral properties of the pulsar .",

    "spectral fitting for all data was performed using xspec v12.6.0 and the errors quoted are at the 90% confidence level .",

    "_ swift_-bat spectral fitting was restricted to the 15100 kev band since the spectrum above 100 kev was contaminated by noise .",
    "we fitted the time - averaged burst spectrum with simple models : a pl model with @xmath1=2.6@xmath110.4 ( reduced chi - squared @xmath32=1.531 ( 36 ) where @xmath33 is the number of degrees of freedom ) and a bb model with @xmath14=8.7@xmath111.3 kev ( @xmath32=1.292 ( 36 ) ) .",
    "neither model gave a good fit , however there were hints of spectral features ( figure  2 ) .",
    "hence , we added gaussian emission lines to the pl model and found that the addition of three broad lines at energies 26.7@xmath34 kev , 39.6@xmath35 kev and 59.8@xmath36 kev improves the fit ( @xmath32=0.963 ( 27 ) ) with an @xmath37-test probability of 7@xmath410@xmath38 , and @xmath1=3.2@xmath2 .",
    "the best - fit parameters are summarized in table  1 .",

    "the addition of a second bb - component to the above mentioned models was ruled out statistically owing to higher @xmath32 values . at a distance of 8.5 kpc ( tian & leahy 2008 ) , we estimate a burst fluence of 1.1@xmath3@xmath410@xmath5 ergs  @xmath6 , a peak luminosity of 2.9@xmath7@xmath410@xmath8 ergs  s@xmath9 and a total energy of 7.2@xmath3@xmath410@xmath10  ergs in the 15100 kev band",

    "in order to further address the statistical significance of the spectral features , we performed a monte carlo simulation in xspec .",

    "we first fitted the data with an absorbed bb model which did not provide an acceptable fit ( @xmath32=1.419 ( 87 ) ) yielding a low @xmath45=(0.8@xmath110.2)@xmath410@xmath46 @xmath6 and @xmath14=0.85@xmath110.05  kev , with the high - energy end of the spectra poorly characterized .",

    "we also considered the inclusion of a second bb - component ( generally required to describe the magnetar persistent spectra ) to the pl model which gave an @xmath45=(2.2@xmath110.1)@xmath410@xmath46 @xmath6 , @xmath1=2.6@xmath47 , and @xmath14=0.55@xmath48  kev with @xmath32=1.034 ( 85 ) .",

    "a pl+bb model yields a good fit ( @xmath32=0.931 ( 1267 ) ) with the following parameters : @xmath45=(2.2@xmath110.1)@xmath410@xmath46 @xmath6 , @xmath1=1.9@xmath110.2 , and @xmath14=0.45@xmath110.03  kev ( inferred radius @xmath49=5.0@xmath50  km ) .",
    "the best - fit spectral parameters and spectra are shown in table  1 and figure  3 , respectively .",
    "the pre - burst spectra were further explored using a bb+bb model which provided acceptable fits ( @xmath32=0.942 ( 1267 ) ) , but with a lower column density @xmath45=(1.9@xmath110.1)@xmath410@xmath46 @xmath6 , soft @xmath14=0.47@xmath51  kev , and hard @xmath14=1.46@xmath52  kev . here ,",
    "we adopt pl+bb as the best - fit model since the @xmath45 derived in this case is closer to that obtained for its associated snr kes 73 ( kumar et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "the spectral parameters obtained for the pre - burst quiescent emission are in good agreement with those obtained in previous studies ( morii et al .",
    "2003 ; nakagawa et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the 0.510 kev unabsorbed pre - burst and post - burst fluxes are @xmath53=4.3@xmath15@xmath410@xmath13 ergs  @xmath6  s@xmath9 ( @xmath54=3.7@xmath55@xmath410@xmath56 ergs  s@xmath9 ) and @xmath57=9.1@xmath12@xmath410@xmath13 ergs  @xmath6  s@xmath9 ( @xmath58=7.8@xmath59@xmath410@xmath56 ergs  s@xmath9 ) , respectively .",
    "this represents a 2.1 times increase in the unabsorbed flux following the burst , consistent with the pulsed flux increase ( 2.02@xmath110.06 ) reported using a rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) too observation in the 211 kev band ( dib et al .",
    "thanks to _ swift _ , the first burst from 1e  1841045 and outbursts from two other axps ( cxou  j164710.2455216 , 1e  1541.05408 ) have been detected , enabling a detailed study of their burst activity with bat in the hard x - ray band and of the underlying prompt persistent emission immediately after outburst with xrt in the soft x - ray band .",
    "such studies are vital to understanding the physics of the outburst and for testing the predictions of the magnetar model .    as an extension to the magnetar model , thompson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggest that the twisted internal @xmath16-field stresses the crust in turn twisting the external dipole field . when a static twist is implanted , currents flow into the magnetosphere . as the twist angle grows",
    ", electrons provide an increasing optical depth to resonant cyclotron scattering building up a flatter photon power - law component .",
    "meanwhile , returning currents provide an extra heating of the star surface increasing the x - ray flux .",
    "hence , a correlation between x - ray flux and spectral hardness is expected .",
    "bursts arise from the sudden small - scale surface reconfiguration owing to a magnetospheric twist and the activity increases with increasing twist angle .",
    "beloborodov ( 2009 ) suggests that the twisted magnetosphere gradually untwists by producing radiation where the thermal component is expected to survive the time - scale required to dissipate the twist energy , while the non - thermal component is short - lived since the resonant scattering is no longer possible when the current - carrying bundle becomes too small .",
    "the burst observed from 1e  1841045 is short ( 32  ms ) , symmetric , and well - fit by a pl model in the 15100 kev range .",
    "these characteristics fit the description of type a axp bursts , similar to those seen in sgrs , which are short , symmetric , and uncorrelated with pulse phase as opposed to type b bursts , seen exclusively in axps , with long extended tails ( lasting tens to hundreds seconds ) , thermal spectra , and occurring at pulse maximum ( woods et al . 2005 ) .",
    "furthermore , type a and b bursts are believed to be produced by different mechanisms with the former interpreted as due to a reconnection in the upper magnetosphere ( lyutikov 2002 ) while the latter predominantly due to a rearrangement of the @xmath16-field lines anchored to the surface after a crustal fracture ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) .",
    "it is also notable that 1e  1841045 , showing hard x - ray emission up to 150 kev ( @xmath1=1.32@xmath110.11 ; kuiper et al .",
    "2004 ) and interpreted as originating from the magnetosphere , exhibited a soft burst spectrum ( @xmath1=3.2@xmath2 ; 15100 kev ) possibly due to a renewed magnetospheric activity in the external @xmath16-field .",
    "we studied the 0.510 kev pre- and post - burst persistent emission of 1e  1841045 using _ xmm - newton _ and _ swift_-xrt data , respectively .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ spectra were described by a bb - component ( @xmath14=0.45@xmath110.03  kev , @xmath49=5.0@xmath50  km ) possibly originating from a hot spot on the ns surface , plus a pl - component ( @xmath1=1.9@xmath110.2 ) likely associated with the magnetosphere .",
    "our xrt spectral analysis reveals that the source spectrum softened during the burst with the persistent spectra well fitted by a single pl model ( @xmath1=2.6@xmath110.2 ) accounting for the total flux , which increased by 2.1 times compared to its pre - burst value . by including a bb - component to the pl model ( though not required statistically ; table  1 ) , we find that the pl flux increased by 35@xmath60 with an increase in @xmath1 , while the bb flux decreased by 22@xmath60 with a slight increase in temperature ( @xmath14=0.55@xmath48  kev , @xmath49=1.6@xmath61  km ) with respect to its pre - burst values . if the blackbody emission originates from a hot spot , we find that it has become slightly hotter and smaller post - burst , possibly associated with the burst activity following a small - scale rearrangement of the @xmath16-field .",
    "but , overall the spectrum softened and the total flux increased .",
    "next , we compare our results with those seen in the two other _ swift _ observed axps : cxou  j164710.2455216 and 1e  1541.05408 .",
    "the cxou  j164710.2455216 burst appears similar to that seen in 1e  1841045 in terms of the light curve ( symmetric ) , duration ( @xmath1720  ms ) , and energy ( @xmath1710@xmath62 ergs ) .",
    "the xrt observations taken @xmath1713 hrs past the burst showed a dominant pl - component for @xmath1710 days with the bb - component dominating ( 80@xmath6090@xmath60 ) the total flux in the observations taken a month later ( israel et al . 2007 ) .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observations taken 4.3 days prior to and 1.5 days post this outburst suggest spectral hardening accompanied by 100 times luminosity increase , interpreted as due to a plastic deformation of the ns s crust which induced a slight twist in the external @xmath16-field causing the x - ray burst ( muno et al .",
    "however , a reconnection activity in the 1e  1841045 magnetosphere might have caused the x - ray burst .",
    "on the other hand , the bursts from 1e  1541.05408 were characterized by long extended tails in some of its 2008 bursts and the xrt spectra ( spanning 100  s since the bat trigger until 3 weeks post - burst ) were described by either a pl or a bb model , with the initial hard ( @xmath1@xmath172 or @xmath14@xmath171.4  kev ) outburst spectrum steepening ( @xmath1@xmath174 or @xmath14@xmath170.8  kev ) within one day from the bat trigger ( israel et al .",
    "when fitted with a bb+pl model , the spectrum taken 100  s after the bat trigger was totally dominated by a pl - component , while in the observations taken 0.05 and 0.2 days after the trigger , the bb - component becomes dominant and one day later , the pl - component becomes undetectable ( israel et al . 2010 ) .",
    "similarly , the 1e  1841045 post - burst emission , taken 0.5  hr and 1.9  hr since the bat trigger , is also dominated by the pl - component even though the timescales are different .",
    "unfortunately , xrt stopped observing 1e  1841045 within 3  hrs of the bat trigger and hence , we can not make a judgement about the evolution of its spectrum in comparison with the other two axps .",
    "however we note that while both cxou  j164710.2455216 and 1e  1541.05408 had shown a flux - hardness correlation associated with the burst , we see a flux - hardness anti - correlation in 1e  1841045 ( or steepening of the spectrum immediately post - burst ) , a result that is contradictory to the twisted magnetosphere predictions .",
    "however , in a globally twisted magnetosphere , the x - ray spectrum can soften following the burst as the magnetosphere becomes more transparent to cyclotron scattering ( thompson et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the _ swift_-bat burst spectrum of 1e  1841045 is further intriguing in that it showed emission line features at energies 26.7@xmath34  kev , 39.6@xmath35  kev and 59.8@xmath36  kev , at the @xmath1723 sigma level .",
    "magnetars spectral features ( often interpreted as proton cyclotron lines from @xmath16-fields@xmath1710@xmath1810@xmath19  g ) have been reported , although not always with high statistical significance , using _ rxte _ from sgrs 1900 + 14 , 180620 , and axps xte j1810197 , 1e  1048.15937 , 4u  0142 + 61 ( strohmayer & ibrahim 2000 ; ibrahim et al .",
    "2002 ; woods et al . 2005 ; gavriil et al .",
    "2002 , 2010 ) .",
    "the features reported here are interestingly multiples of the 1314 kev line reported with @xmath63 in 3 other axps ; and so , if interpreted as the second , third , and fourth harmonics of a proton cyclotron line at @xmath171314 kev , they would yield @xmath16=(3.53.7)@xmath410@xmath19  g , which is close to the axp s dipole @xmath16-field ( 7.1@xmath410@xmath18  g ) .",
    "however , the detection of harmonics would argue against a proton cyclotron origin since higher harmonics should be suppressed for proton resonances ( s. zane , private communication ) . on the other hand ,",
    "electron cyclotron lines from magnetar - strength @xmath16-fields would fall in the mev energy range .",
    "we have further investigated whether any of these lines could be instrumental background and consulted with the bat team ( c. markwardt , private communication ) .",
    "the bat cdznte detectors have escape lines and instrumental k - edges at 27 kev ( cd ) , 32 kev ( te ) , and @xmath64am lines at 59.5  kevdigest.html . ] .",
    "while the mask - weighting technique and systematic error correction should take care of these lines , they can be still present though will be only a percentage of the source flux ; and for a short burst of 32  ms , background line features will be negligible .",
    "we however note that the background subtraction that comes from mask - weighting depends on the assumption of gaussian statistics , which likely breaks down at low count levels .",
    "unfortunately , the low statistics limit is a realm which the _ bat _ team has not explored for understanding statistics of the mask - weighting technique ( c. markwardt , private communication ) .",
    "we conclude that the origin of these spectral features is unclear and a confirmation of their presence is needed with other instruments .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the _ swift _ observations of the first burst detected from the axp 1e  1841045 . the 15100 kev time - averaged burst spectrum and the 0.510 kev persistent spectra obtained with _",
