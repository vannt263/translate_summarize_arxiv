    "<S> the boltzmann equation for excess cooper pairs above @xmath0 is derived in the framework of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) theory using langevin s approach of the stochastic differential equation . </S>",
    "<S> the newton dynamic equation for the momentum - dependent drift velocity is obtained and the effective drag force is determined by the energy dependent life time of the metastable cooper pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the newton equation gives just the drude mobility for the fixed momentum of cooper pairs . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the comparison with the well - known result for aslamazov - larkin paraconductivity and bcs treatment of the excess hall effect can give the final determination of all the coefficients of tdgl theory . as a result </S>",
    "<S> the intuitive arguments used for an interpretation of the experimental data for fluctuation kinetics are successively introduced . </S>",
    "<S> the presented simple picture of the degenerated bose gas in @xmath1-approximation near the bose - einstein condensation temperature can be used for analysis of fluctuation conductivity for the cases of high frequency and external magnetic field for layered and bulk superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the work of the boltzmann equation is illustrated by frequency - dependent aslamazov - larkin conductivity in nanowires , in the two - dimensional case and in the case of strong electric field where the tdgl equation is solved directly . </S>",
    "<S> there are also derived explicit formulas for the current in the case of arbitrary time dependence of electric field up to thz range , the distribution of fluctuation cooper pairs for nonparabolic dispersion , the influence of the energy cut - off and the self - consistent equation for the reduced temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the general theory is illustrated by formulas for fluctuation conductivity in nanowires and nanostructured superconductors . </S>"
