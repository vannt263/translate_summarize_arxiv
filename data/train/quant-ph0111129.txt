    "quantum error correction protects quantum information against environmental noise @xcite . after the initial discovery of quantum error correction codes @xcite",
    "significant progress has been made in the development and understanding of these codes .",
    "of particular significance has been the discovery of minimal codes @xcite , which are the simplest codes able to correct amplitude and/or phase errors @xcite .",
    "also the possibility of encoding and decoding in presence of noise has been demonstrated @xcite . however , these fault - tolerant schemes are extremely complicated and involve many more qubits than simple codes .",
    "their experimental implementation is therefore unlikely , at least in a near future .    on the other hand , the issue of errors arising during",
    "encoding and decoding has been partially investigated in the simplest error correcting codes @xcite .",
    "these are the codes that would , hopefully , be implemented in a near future . along this line",
    ", we would address the question of how timing problems affect the performances of simple codes .",
    "as matter of fact , encoding and decoding procedures , even for simple codes , take place in several steps requiring turning on and off given interactions .",
    "hence , it should be natural to deal with time uncertainties leading to noisy effect .",
    "these may be due , for instance , to the timing of laser pulses @xcite , or rf fields @xcite , and might compromise the correction procedure .",
    "thus , the aim of this work is to study the circumstances under which a simple correcting code results beneficial notwithstanding temporal imperfections during encoding and decoding . to this end",
    "we shall exploit a quantum mechanical consistent approach @xcite .",
    "let us consider a single qubit in a two dimensional hilbert space . a convenient basis is given by the eigenstates of the pauli matrix @xmath0 . we denote them as @xmath1 .",
    "then , the environmental effects on the qubit can be described by means of the lindblad master equation ( in natural units ) @xmath2 + \\sum_j\\left(l_j\\rho l_j^{\\dag } -\\frac{1}{2}l_j^{\\dag}l_j\\rho -\\frac{1}{2}\\rho l_j^{\\dag}l_j\\right)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the system hamiltonian and @xmath4 are the lindblad operators representing the interaction with the environment .",
    "we are now going to consider the free hamiltonian @xmath5 having unit frequency .",
    "furthermore , the most general interaction is represented by the isotropic noise with lindblad operators @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ; @xmath9 being the decoherence rate .    for a generic initial state @xmath10 ) , in case of isotropic noise , reads @xmath11    \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left[\\frac{|c_0|^2}{2}\\left(1-e^{-4\\gamma t}\\right ) + \\frac{|c_1|^2}{2}\\left(1+e^{-4\\gamma t}\\right)\\right ]    \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left[\\frac{c_0c_1^*}{2}\\left(e^{-2\\gamma t } + e^{-6\\gamma t}\\right)\\right ]    \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left[\\frac{c_0^*c_1}{2}\\left(e^{-2\\gamma t } + e^{-6\\gamma t}\\right)\\right ]     in the following we shall consider a simple information process , i.e. the information storage . thus the single qubit dynamics is exactly described by eq.([me ] ) .",
    "the probability that the qubit ( [ psi ] ) remains error free ( for isotropic noise ) after a time @xmath12 , is given by @xmath13 where the subscript @xmath14 means the evolution under the reversible part of the master equation ( i.e. only that containing @xmath3 ) , while @xmath15 means the average overall possible states ( all possible values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "it results , for a storage time @xmath18 , that @xmath19    consider now the @xmath20-qubit encoding and decoding procedure @xcite which is able to correct perfectly for a single error in one of the @xmath20 qubits , but fails if there are two or more errors .",
    "then , the probability of survival of a single encoded qubit state for time @xmath18 is the sum of the zero error and one error probabilities ; that is @xmath21 ^ 5 + 5[{\\cal p}_s(t)]^4 \\times[1-{\\cal p}_s(t)]\\,,\\ ] ] where we assumed each qubit suffering the same decoherence rate .",
    "the star superscript on @xmath22 reminds us that the probability refers to the encoded qubit .",
    "consider now the case where encoding and decoding procedures are not immune from the noise . specifically",
    ", we wish to consider the case where only timing problems occur ; so , we assume the isotropic noise to be negligible during this stages",
    ". this could be reasonable if the decoherence rate is very small and the encoding ( decoding ) time is much smaller than the storage time .",
    "then , we denote with @xmath23 the time for the encoding procedure .",
    "the same is also true for the reverse process , the decoding . so that the total encoding+decoding time would be @xmath24 with @xmath25 .    to account for timing problems we exploit a recent theory developed by one of us @xcite .",
    "namely , the evolution of a system is averaged on a suitable probability distribution @xmath26 where @xmath27 represents all possible times within the ensemble .",
    "let @xmath28 be the initial state , then the evolved state would be @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the solution of the liouville - von neumann equation .",
    "one can write as well @xmath31 where the superoperator @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 in ref .",
    "@xcite , the function @xmath26 has been determined to satisfy the following conditions : i ) @xmath34 must be a density operator ; ii ) @xmath35 satisfies the semigroup property .",
    "these requirements are satisfied by @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the gamma function and the parameter @xmath39 naturally appears as a scaling time .",
    "its meaning can be understood by considering the mean @xmath40 , and the variance @xmath41 .",
    "hence , @xmath39 rules the strength of time fluctuations , or , otherwise , the characteristic correlation time of fluctuations . when @xmath42 , @xmath43 so that @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the usual evolution .",
    "coming back to our problem , we consider the reversible evolution in eq.([rhot ] ) ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) , and we then average obtaining @xmath47 accordingly to eq.([rhobar ] ) .",
    "therefore , the probability that the system remains unaffected by timing errors is @xmath48 roughly speaking , this can be used to calculate the probability of no errors per qubit during encoding+decoding procedure , that is @xmath49    thus , the probability that there is no error in the @xmath20-qubit system is the product of the probability ( [ ptted ] ) of all @xmath20 qubits surviving @xmath24 with the probability ( [ pss ] ) of zero or one error ( which can be corrected ) during the time @xmath18 .",
    "this leads to @xmath50 ^ 5\\times { \\cal p}_s^*(t)\\,.\\ ] ] we now introduce a parameter which markers the efficiency of the correction procedure .",
    "namely , we introduce the ratio of the mismatch without correction to the mismatch with correction @xmath51 ^ 5}{1-p(t_{ed},t)}\\,.\\ ] ] provided that @xmath52 stays above unit value , there should be benefit from error correction even though timing errors occur during encoding+decoding .    in figure 1",
    "we show the contours of @xmath52 in the plane of parameters @xmath39 and @xmath24 . from bright to dark region",
    "the correction procedure becomes less efficient . in the black zone",
    "it results useless since @xmath53 .",
    "the number of correction procedures applied during the time @xmath18 can be varied .",
    "consider the problem of optimizing error correction to achieve the greatest probability success for the storage of a qubit state , given the freedom to apply an arbitrary number @xmath54 of encoding+decoding procedures during @xmath18 .",
    "assume that these are spaced out equally . in case of perfect error correction",
    ", it is obviously beneficial to apply as many corrections as possible .",
    "the probability of success for @xmath54 applications is @xmath55^n\\,.\\ ] ] this maximizes for @xmath56 , tending to unity .",
    "such behavior is like the zeno or watchdog effect ; there is no change at all from the initial state as @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "however , in case of timing errors , there should be an optimum value of @xmath54 .",
    "the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ pcal ] ) to @xmath54 equally spaced corrections is @xmath57^{5n}\\times[{\\cal p}_s^*(t / n)]^n\\,.\\ ] ]    then , in figure 2 we plot @xmath58 as function of @xmath54 .",
    "we see that the optimum number @xmath54 which maximize the probability decreases by increasing the value of @xmath39 . in figure",
    ", we pass from @xmath59 for @xmath60 , to @xmath61 for @xmath62 , and @xmath63 for @xmath64 . beyond that value",
    "the error correction becomes useless .",
    "in conclusion we have considered the problem of temporal imperfections in building up correcting codes . to this end",
    "we have exploited a quite ductile model based on random time evolution .    in ref .",
    "@xcite non - dissipative decoherence bounds for ion - trap based quantum computation were established by estimating @xmath65 . in such a case @xmath39",
    "gives an estimate of the pulse are fluctuations for the laser inducing transitions .",
    "this value of @xmath39 gives the restriction @xmath66 for the success of the above considered code .",
    "finally , we recognize that our approach is somewhat rough since the reversible dynamics during encoding and decoding has been identified with the free dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , it allows an estimation of realistic performances of simple challenging codes .",
    "a more accurate study is left for future work .",
    "we are indebted to david vitali for his useful comments ."
