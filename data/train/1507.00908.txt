    "matrix rank minimizing  @xcite is ubiquitous in machine learning , computer vision , control , signal processing and system identification .",
    "for instance , low - rank representation based subspace clustering @xcite and matrix completion @xcite methods have achieved great success recently .",
    "subspace clustering @xcite is one of the fundamental topics with numerous applications , e.g. , image representation @xcite , face clustering @xcite , and motion segmentation @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that high - dimensional data is more likely a union of low - dimensional subspaces rather than one individual subspace .",
    "for example , different subspaces are needed to describe trajectories of different moving objects in a video sequence .",
    "subspace clustering is an intrinsically difficult problem , since we need to simultaneously cluster all data points into multiple groups and find a low - dimensional subspace fitting each group of points .",
    "subspace clustering has been an active research topic over the past decades .",
    "four main categories of methods are proposed @xcite : iterative , algebraic , statistical , and spectral clustering - based methods .",
    "the first three kinds of approaches are sensitive to initialization , noise and outliers ; in addition , they are difficult to optimize @xcite .",
    "spectral clustering - based methods have achieved promising performance , where the key is to learn a good affinity matrix of data points .",
    "for instance , the algorithms of local subspace affinity ( lsa ) @xcite , locally linear manifold clustering ( llmc ) @xcite , and spectral local best - fit flats ( slbf ) @xcite , use local information around each point to construct the affinity matrix , while spectral curvature clustering ( scc ) @xcite method preserves the global structures of the whole data set in deriving the affinity matrix .",
    "subsequently , k - means @xcite or normalized cuts ( ncut ) @xcite are applied to the affinity matrix to obtain clustering results .",
    "recently , some spectral clustering based methods , such as sparse representation ( ssc ) @xcite , low - rank representation ( lrr ) @xcite , have been proposed to obtain state - of - the - art results in subspace clustering .",
    "ssc represents each data point as a sparse linear combination of the other points and solves an @xmath0-norm regularized minimization problem for sparsity .",
    "ssc shows promising results if the subspaces are either independent or disjoint @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of lrr is to learn a low - rank representation of data by capturing the global euclidean structure of the whole data . in this scheme , each data point is represented as a linear combination of the examples in the data matrix itself , and a convex nuclear norm minimization is used as a surrogate of the rank function to obtain the desired low - rank representation . though its optimization is well - studied and has a global optimum , its performance may be far from optimal in real applications because the nuclear norm might not be a good approximation to the rank function . compared to the rank function to which all nonzero singular values have equal contributions , the nuclear norm treats those values differently by simply adding them together . as a result , the nuclear norm may be dominated by a few very large singular values and significantly deviated from the true value of the rank .",
    "several papers have considered this problem of using the nuclear norm and designed methods to alleviate it by either thresholding or removing some of the singular values ; for instance , singular value thresholding @xcite and truncated nuclear norm @xcite both considerably enhance the performance of matrix completion .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to use a log - determinant ( logdet ) function for rank approximation and study its minimization in subspace clustering .",
    "different from the nuclear norm - based approaches which minimize the summation of all singular values , our approach aims to minimize the rank by making the contribution to be much closer to one from a big singular value , while zero from a small singular value . in this way",
    ", we can get closer and more robust approximation to the rank function than the nuclear norm . since the logdet function is non - convex ,",
    "we apply the method of augmented lagrange multipliers ( alm ) to solve the associated optimization for potentially large - scale applications , in which the subproblem for minimizing the logdet function in each iteration has a closed - form solution .",
    "to demonstrate the effectiveness of our logdet minimization + method , we apply it to subspace clustering . by employing a rather simple formulation based on the logdet function",
    ", we obtain a low - rank representation for subspace clustering .",
    "subsequently , we exploit the angular information of principal directions of such a representation to further enhance the separation ability of the affinity matrix . in summary ,",
    "our main contributions of this work include :    * more accurate and robust rank approximation is used to obtain the low - rank representation , which is able to capture the global structure of the dataset . *",
    "an iterative optimization algorithm is designed for minimizing this rank approximation - based objective function .",
    "theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm converges to a stationary point .",
    "specifically , the proposed optimization method is applied to subspace clustering . *",
    "angular information of principal directions of the low - rank representation is employed to further exploit the intrinsic local geometrical structure relevant to the membership of data points . *",
    "extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed logdet minimization method for rank approximation .",
    "especially , when used for subspace clustering , our simple formulation shows favorable performance compared to other state - of - the - art methods , although we do not explicitly account for outliers in our model .",
    "this demonstrates the robustness of our approach .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : section [ relatedwork ] provides a brief review of lrr and ssc . in section [ proposedmodel ] ,",
    "we present the proposed approximation and design an efficient optimization scheme .",
    "we give convergence analysis in section [ convergence ] .",
    "experimental results are shown in section [ experiment ] .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we give a brief review of ssc and lrr .",
    "let @xmath1\\in \\mathbf{\\mathcal{r}}^{d\\times n}$ ] be a set of @xmath2-dimensional data points drawn from an unknown union of @xmath3 linear subspaces @xmath4 .",
    "the task of subspace clustering is to segment data points into @xmath3 subspaces .",
    "lrr tries to seek the lowest rank representation among many possible linear combinations of the bases in a given dictionary , which typically is the data matrix itself .",
    "the problem can be formulated as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 $ ] is the coefficient matrix with each @xmath7 being the representation of @xmath8 .",
    "the above problem is np - hard due to the combinatorial nature of the rank function .",
    "the tightest convex relaxation of the rank function @xcite is the nuclear norm . for a matrix @xmath9 ,",
    "its nuclear norm is defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 means the @xmath12-th singular value of @xmath13 . using this relaxation",
    ", lrr solves the following problem : @xmath14 after obtaining @xmath15 , the affinity matrix @xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 then the spectral clustering algorithm , normalized cuts @xcite is used to produce the final segmentation .    ssc aims to find a sparse representation of @xmath18 by solving the following convex optimization problem : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is a sparse matrix containing the gross error , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 is a matrix of fitting residuals . after obtaining @xmath15 ,",
    "subsequent procedures are similar to lrr .",
    "a function @xmath24 $ ] is absolutely symmetric if @xmath25 is invariant under arbitrary permutations and sign changes of the elements of @xmath26 . based on this function @xmath25 , we have the following theorem @xcite .",
    "function @xmath27 is unitarily invariant if @xmath28 , where @xmath29 whose singular value decomposition is + @xmath30 , @xmath31 are singular values of @xmath18 , and @xmath32 . and the gradient of @xmath33 at @xmath18 is @xmath34 where @xmath35 .    equation ( [ theorem ] ) can be obtained directly from theorem 3.1 of @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we utilize unitarily invariant function logdet to achieve a closer , though not convex , rank relaxation than the nuclear norm .",
    "we apply the method of alm for logdet rank approximation associated minimization . to explain our method",
    ", we specifically consider using logdet as a rank surrograte in subspace clustering .",
    "we first obtain a low - rank representation of high - dimensional data based on the logdet optimization .",
    "then we construct an affinity graph matrix for spectral clustering by using the angular information of principal directions of the low - rank representation .",
    "we use @xmath36 as a surrogate of the rank function of @xmath15 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath37 . because it can be easily verified that @xmath38 for any @xmath39 , we always have @xmath40 ; especially ,",
    "if there are large nonzero singular values , the logdet function will be much smaller than the nuclear norm since @xmath41 for a large @xmath42 .",
    "it is noted that for small nonzero singular values , their contribution to the logdet function will be significantly reduced compared to the nuclear norm . because small nonzero singular values are often regarded as being from noise in the data",
    ", the logdet function reduces noise effect more compared to the nuclear norm .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that a similar function + @xmath43 was proposed in @xcite to approximate rank and iterative linearization was used to find a local minimum .",
    "however , @xmath44 is a very small constant ( e.g. , @xmath45 ) , which leads to biased approximation for small singular values .",
    "this logdet function is differentiable with respect to the singular values by theorem 1 , and even though it is non - convex , its minimization is rather simple by using our optimization method . to explain its minimization",
    ", we consider its specific application to subspace clustering . by employing the above logdet function",
    ", we simply formulate the subspace clustering into the following unconstrained nonconvex minimization problem : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the identity matrix .",
    "the first term of ( [ problemd ] ) is to minimize the rank of @xmath15 , while the second is a relaxation of @xmath48 , which is referred to as the self - expressiveness of @xmath18 with @xmath15 representing the similarity between data points .",
    "because the logdet function is not convex in @xmath15 , we resort to alm technique to solve ( [ problemd ] ) , by re - writing ( [ problemd ] ) as follows : @xmath49    we turn to minimizing the following augmented lagrangian function : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a penalty parameter and @xmath52 is the lagrangian dual variable . with a sufficiently large @xmath53 , the objective function converges to objective function in ( [ problemd ] ) .",
    "this can be solved by updating @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath52 alternatively while fixing the other variables .",

    "@xmath70 , assuming svd of @xmath71 is @xmath72 , @xmath73 , the optimal solution to the following problem @xmath74 is @xmath75 , with @xmath76 obtained by solving scalar minimization problems @xmath77    let @xmath78 be svd of @xmath79 , then @xmath80 . denoting @xmath81 which has exactly the same signular values as @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath82 , we have    & f(z)+z - a_f^2&[lower ] + & = f(x)+x-_a_f^2,&[unitary ] + & = f(_x)+x-_a_f^2,&[inva ] + & = f(_x)+(x_f^2+_a_f^2 - 2x,_a),&[von ] + & f(_x)+(_x_f^2+_a_f^2 - 2_x,_a),&[eight ] + & = f(_x)+_x-_a_f^2,&[nine ] + & = f(_z)+_z-_a_f^2,&[ten ] + & = _ i , & + & _ i f(_i^ * ) + ( _ i^ * - _ i , a)^2 .    in the above , ( [ unitary ] ) holds because the frobenius norm is unitary invariant ; ( [ inva ] ) holds because @xmath83 is unitary invariant ; ( [ von ] ) is true by von neumann s inequality ; and ( [ ten ] ) holds as @xmath84 . the inequality between ( [ unitary ] ) and ( [ nine ] )",
    "can also be obtained by the hoffman - wielandt inequality .",
    "therefore , ( [ ten ] ) is a lower bound of ( [ lower ] ) , where @xmath85 is obtained by minimizing ( [ ten ] ) .",
    "note that the equality in ( [ eight ] ) is attained if @xmath86 . because @xmath87 , the svd of @xmath15 is @xmath88 , which is the minimizer of problem ( [ eq : zobj ] ) .",
    "hence the proof is completed .",
    "the first - order optimality condition is that the gradient of ( [ scalar ] ) with respect to each singular value should vanish .",
    "thus for subproblem ( [ variablez ] ) , we have @xmath89 where svd of @xmath90 is @xmath91 .",
    "the above equation is cubic and gives three roots .",
    "in addition , we need to enforce the nonnegativity of @xmath92 .",
    "it is easily seen that there exists at least one nonnegative root .",
    "and there is a unique minimizer @xmath93 if @xmath94 .",
    "finally , we obtain the update of @xmath15 variable with @xmath95 .",

    "problem ( [ problemd ] ) is nonconvex .",
    "it is difficult to give a rigorous mathematical argument for convergence to a ( local ) optimum .",
    "we will provide a theoretical proof that our algorithm converges to an accumulation point and this accumulation point is a stationary point .",
    "our empirical experiments confirm the convergence of the proposed method on the benchmark datasets .",

    "now we will construct an affinity matrix @xmath16 for subspace clustering .",

    "first , we use the solutions from lrr as initial guess for scld .",
    "second , we just generate some random numbers .",
    "we find that we can still get the same results .",
    "actually , it is recommended to use convex relaxation solutions as initialization for nonconvex formulations @xcite .",
    "in this paper we propose to use a log - determinant function ( logdet ) as a rank approximation to recover the low - rank representation of high - dimensional data .",
    "when applied to subspace clustering , the proposed algorithm , called scld , exploits both global and local structures of the data through the logdet rank approximation and angle - based affinity matrix .",
    "consequently , it captures more intrinsic information of the data that benefits subspace clustering .",
    "our extensive experimental results show that it outperforms other low - rank representation algorithms based on the nuclear norm .",
    "therefore logdet appears to be an effective rank approximation function well suited to subspace clustering applications .",
    "although our model is simple and with no explicit modeling of outliers , it is resilient to various corruptions .",
    "our future research will consider modeling corruptions explicitly .",
