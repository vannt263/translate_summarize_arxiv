    "this is the case even after allowing for additional absorption ; including extra absorption in the model did not alter the fit and could not account for the roll - over in the soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "thus the observed roll - over in the soft excess must be intrinsic to the source and not an effect of line - of - sight absorption .",

    "below @xmath79  kev the spectrum becomes very hard , with @xmath80 , corresponding to the low energy roll - over in the soft excess .",
    "the models based around thermal continuum emission ( multiple blackbodies , comptonised blackbody , disc blackbody or bremsstrahlung ) provided comparably good fits and managed to account for some degree of the roll - over .",
    "unsurprisingly , given the lack of emission lines in the rgs spectrum , the mekal model gave a very poor fit using solar abundances . when allowed to be free the best - fitting abundance was zero , which essentially reproduced a thermal bremsstrahlung continuum .",
    "model @xmath81 , shown in fig  [ fig:3bb ] , provided the best fit of the thermal models , using three blackbodies to model the soft excess ( with temperatures of @xmath82  ev ) . the broad - band ( @xmath83  kev ) unabsorbed luminosity ( predicted by this three - blackbody model ) was @xmath84  erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the spectrum was also fitted with ionized reflection models including relativistic smearing .",
    "for all the reflection - based models the disc emission was very centrally concentrated ( e.g. @xmath85 for model @xmath86 and @xmath87 for model @xmath88 ) .",
    "in fact , the best - fitting emissivity index was often unreasonably steep ( @xmath89 ) and so the fits were performed with @xmath90 kept as a fixed parameter .",
    "furthermore , the steep emissivity meant the fitting was insensitive to the @xmath91 parameter , this was therefore kept fixed at @xmath92 .",
    "it was not possible to model the entire soft excess in terms of emission from an ionized accretion disc ( models @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) .",
    "a single ionized reflector ( model @xmath93 ) was unable to fit the soft and hard bands simultaneously .",
    "the spectrum above @xmath75  kev was well fitted with only weak ionization ( section  [ sect : refln ] ) , in which case the reflector does not produce enough soft x - ray emission to account for any of the soft excess . allowing for an additional , independent ionized reflector ( with much higher ionization ;",
    "@xmath95 ) still gave a poor fit to the data ( model @xmath94 ) .",
    "the primary reason for this failure is that the highly ionized reflector , while producing a strong soft excess , also produced very strong , broad spectral features in the fe k - band .",
    "thus the bulk of the soft excess can not be explained in terms of ionized reflection ( see also discussion in vaughan 2002 ) .",
    "ogle ( 2004 ) recently proposed that weak structures in the soft excess of the bright seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4051 can be explained by o  viii recombination emission ( both the lines and radiative recombination continuum , rrc ) from a relativistic accretion disc .",
    "models @xmath86 and @xmath88 work on a similar principle to the model of ogle ( 2004 ) , in that the bulk of the soft excess is accounted for using a continuum component ( thermal bremsstrahlung or power - law ) and the relatively weak residual structures are fitted using emission from an ionized , relativistic accretion disc ) .",
    "these models gave quite competitive fits to the data , superior to the ionized reflection models without an additional soft x - ray continuum component .",
    "in each case the disc was only mildly ionized ( @xmath96 ) and so the fits were performed with the ionization parameter kept fixed at @xmath97 . at this low level of ionization",
    "the reflector contributed modest equivalent width , broad emission features to the soft x - ray spectrum ( mainly from recombination to o@xmath98 and o@xmath99 ) .",
    "for example , the equivalent widths of the emissions lines predicted by model @xmath88 were @xmath100  ev and @xmath101  ev for o  vii he@xmath102 and o  viii ly@xmath102 , respectively .",
    "these models did provide reasonable fits to the data ( compared to the other models ) and so it is at least plausible that some spectral structure in the soft excess of could be accounted for by ionized disc emission .",
    "model @xmath86 accounts for the majority of the soft excess using a @xmath103  kev bremsstrahlung continuum whilst model @xmath88 used a @xmath104 power - law .",
    "notably the bremsstrahlung continuum provided a better fit to the soft x - ray spectrum than the power - law ( see table  [ tab : soft_fits ] ) .",
    "however , a problem with both these models is that the width of the observed fe k@xmath102 line in over - predicted ( see section  [ sect : iron ] ) by the strong gravitational redshift on the reflection spectrum ( implied by the small inner radius ) .",
    "it should be noted that the ross & fabian ( 1993 ) code was chosen to model the soft x - ray emission expected from an ionized disc , instead of fitting the o  viii emission independently as was performed by ogle ( 2004 ) .",
    "the model used by ogle ( 2004 ) neglected a number of effects that must be important in a realistic disc .",
    "firstly it did not account for emission lines from other species ( e.g. o  vii ) nor from other ions ( e.g. c , n , fe ) which should also contribute to the soft x - ray spectrum ( e.g. ballantyne , ross & fabian 2002 ) .",
    "secondly it did not include the associated compton reflection continuum .",
    "thirdly , the o  viii lyman series line ratios were calculated in the optically thin limit , whereas a realistic accretion disc is expected to be optically thick to the lines .",
    "this means that , before they can escape the disc , photons from higher - order lyman series lines ( e.g. ly@xmath105 etc . )",
    "will be degraded into lower energy photons from other series and ly@xmath102 photons . thus the higher - order lyman lines should be strongly suppressed , compared to the optically thin case , and the emission dominated by the ly@xmath102 line .",
    "therefore , a realistic accretion disc spectrum would be expected to produce negligible emission in the higher order lyman lines .",

    "the relative strength of the narrow line ( @xmath135  ev ) further suggests the sky covering fraction of the material is small ( @xmath136 ; nandra & george 1994 ) or the optical depth is small ( @xmath137 ; leahy & creighton 1993 ) or both .",
    "the broad component to the line has a velocity width @xmath138 km s@xmath2 , far broader than the broad optical lines ( e.g. @xmath139  km s@xmath2 ; wandel 1999 ) . however , there is no requirement for the line emitting region to extend into the region of strong gravity about the black hole ( @xmath140  ) which would produce an asymmetric redward tail on the line profile ( section  [ sect : iron ] ) .",
    "the best - fitting parameters of the disc line model are slightly unusual ; the inclination angle is high ( @xmath141 ) , the inner radius is rather large ( @xmath142 ) and the rest - frame energy is unusual ( @xmath143  kev ) .",
    "one plausible origin for this line is a weakly ionized accretion disc .",
    "the fact that the inner radius is greater than @xmath144 could mean the disc is truncated . however , the unusual energy of the line ( corresponding to mildly ionized iron ) might allow for a simpler alternative . if the disc survives down to the isco but rapidly becomes ionized with decreasing radius then , depending on the detailed ionization structure , the innermost regions may produce little observable line emission ( see e.g. ross , fabian & young 1999 ) .",
    "however , as demonstrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] there is sufficient leverage in the fit to allow for a smaller inner radius ( @xmath145 ) , and also lower inclination angle , provided the emissivity law is quite flat ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sect : iron ] a good fit can be obtained with @xmath147 and @xmath148 provided that there are two co - existing fe k@xmath102 emission lines arising in the disc ( at energies of @xmath149 and @xmath150  kev ) and no intrinsically narrow component .",
    "this may be feasible if the disc is clumpy or inhomogeneous ( ballantyne , turner & blaes 2004 ) .",
    "the required flat emissivity can be produced if the disc is illuminated from a great height .",
    "figure  [ fig : emissivity ] shows the effect of altering @xmath151 in a ` lamppost ' geometry [ i.e. the disc was assumed to be flat and illuminated by a central point source raised by a height @xmath152 , in which case the emissivity law is given by @xmath153 .",
    "this demonstrates that if the x - illumination is provided from a height @xmath154 the emissivity will be quite flat out to similarly large radii .",
    "illumination from a large height would require a non - standard geometry for the x - ray emitting region , one possibility is the ` aborted jet ' model of ghisellini , harrdt & matt ( 2004 ) .",
    "these new x - ray observations showed  to posses no evidence of an x - ray warm absorber and placed upper limits on the ionic column densities that are substantially lower than those of more typical , absorbed seyfert 1s .",
    "for example , ngc 3783 shows o  vii and o  viii absorption with column densities two orders of magnitude higher ( kaspi 2002 ) .",
    "kaastra ( 2000 ) observed ngc 5548 and measured c  vi , n  vi , o  vii and o  viii absorption lines with corresponding ionic column densities an order of magnitude higher than the limits obtained for .",
    "a last counter example is iras 13349 + 2438 ( sako 2001 ) which shows absorption lines of c  vi , n  vi , o  vii , o  viii , ne  ix and ne  x , with column densities an order of magnitude higher than .",
    "these x - ray observations therefore confirm that  is indeed a ` bare ' seyfert 1 nucleus , as suspected based on its broad band spectral energy distribution ( sed ; edelson & malkan 1986 ; ward 1987 ) and the lack of ultraviolet absorption seen in /fos spectrum ( crenshaw 1999 ) .",
    "other ultraviolet observations have been made with the goddard high - resolution spectrograph ( penton , stocke & shull 2000 ) and with  ( wakker 2003 ) . using these data wakker ( 2003 )",
    "showed that the line - of - sight through the galaxy towards  possesses a very low column of o  vi .",
    "a preliminary examination of these data suggest there may be weak traces of ionized absorption intrinsic to .    ) for a lamppost geometry .",
    ", width=6 ]      shortly after the original discovery of the x - ray warm absorber ( halpern 1984 ) , this phenomenon was found to be common in seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "low resolution spectra from  and suggested @xmath155 per cent of seyfert 1s showed evidence for warm absorption ( turner & pounds 1989 ; nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "subsequent observations with the better spectral resolution afforded by suggested the incidence of warm absorbers was possibly higher ( @xmath156 per cent ; reynolds 1997 ; george 1998 ) .",
    "similar results were found for the ultraviolet absorber based on  fos spectra ( crenshaw 1999 ) .    the increased sensitivity and resolution offered by  and",
    "have allowed for even more sensitive searches for absorption .",
    "these have confirmed that there remains a significant population of seyfert 1s that lack a strong x - ray warm absorber .",
    "in addition to , other seyfert 1s that show a distinct lack of warm absorption in both their  fos ultraviolet and /x - ray spectra include mrk 478 ( marshall 2003a ) , mrk 335 ( gondoin 2002 ) , fairall 9 ( gondoin 2001 ) and mrk 205 ( reeves 2001 ) .",
    "all four of these were in the sample of crenshaw ( 1999 ) and classified as having no intrinsic ultraviolet warm absorber .",
    "other objects known to lack x - ray absorbers include pks 0558504 ( obrien 2001a ) , mcg2 - 58 - 22 ( weaver 1995 ) and ton s180 ( turner 2001b ; vaughan 2002 ) .",
    "these objects are probably not completely without ionized absorption systems .",
    "kriss ( 2002 ) reported weak absorption by the o  vi @xmath157  resonance doublet in both ton s180 and mrk 478 based on high resolution  data ( see also turner 2002 for the  observation of ton s180 ) .",
    "such absorption is too weak to have been detected in the crenshaw ( 1999 ) ultraviolet survey .",
    "the corresponding x - ray warm absorbers in these objects may be present but so weak as to have a negligible effect on the available data .",
    "the reason for the lack of an x - ray warm absorber is unclear .",
    "the most obvious explanation is that overall column density is lower in these objects ( by at least an order of magnitude ) compared to more typical , absorbed seyferts .",
    "however , it is also plausible that a similar column of ionized gas exists but is either too highly ionized to show significant spectral features or lies out of the line of sight ( requiring a covering fraction less than unity ) .",
    "a detailed survey comparing the x - ray and ultraviolet emission / absorption line spectra of a large sample of bright seyferts may be able to answer this question ( see discussions in crenshaw 2003 ) . a more speculative solution , recently proposed by gierliski & done ( 2004 ) ,",
    "is that objects that lack narrow absorption lines may be dominated by a deep , broad absorption trough produced by an absorption system with such high dispersion velocity that no individual lines can be resolved .",
    "this model would require the underlying power - law continuum to be rather steep , which then makes explaining the upturn above @xmath158  kev more difficult to explain .",
    "these observations have clearly revealed a luminous soft excess in , in the sense that an extrapolation of the hard ( @xmath159  kev ) continuum into the soft x - ray band revealed a very significant upturn .",
    "steep soft x - ray spectra were first seen in seyferts using  data ( pravdo 1981 ) and subsequently seen as excesses over the hard power - law by  ( arnaud 1985 ) and  ( bechtold 1987 ) .",
    "early soft x - ray surveys ( e.g. the  survey of turner & pounds 1989 ) suggested that @xmath160 per cent of all seyferts possessed a soft excess component .",
    "the  survey of walter & fink ( 1993 ) also suggested a high incidence of soft excesses .",
    "these numbers were highly uncertain , however , because many of the sample members were absorbed .",
    "complex soft x - ray absorption can mask , or in some cases even mimic , the steeper soft x - ray spectrum indicative of a soft excess .    the recent  and  observations would seem to indicate that all seyfert 1s without strong x - ray warm absorption do show a strong soft excess .",
    "however , many of the well - known examples ( e.g. ton s180 , pks 0558 - 504 , mrk 478 , ngc 4051 and mrk 359 ) are narrow - line seyfert 1s ( nls1s ; osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) .",
    "nls1s are a subclass of seyfert 1s defined by their narrow permitted optical lines ( @xmath161  km s@xmath2 ) but noted for their often exceptionally steep soft x - ray spectra ( boller 1996 ; laor 1997 ; vaughan 1999 ; leighly 1999 ) . until recently it was possible that the soft excess appeared ubiquitous in unabsorbed seyferts only because many of the well - studied examples were nls1s ( i.e. the sample of unabsorbed seyferts was biased towards the soft nls1s ) .",
    "is an interesting counter example , being both unabsorbed and a ` normal , ' broad - line seyfert 1 ( bls1 ) with @xmath162  km s@xmath2 ( wandel 1999 ) .",
    "yet it too shows a strong soft excess .",
    "other notable bls1s that also lack absorption include mrk 205 ( reeves 2001 ) , mrk 335 ( gondoin 2002 ) and fairall 9 ( gondoin 2001 ) , all of which showed soft excesses in their observations .",
    "although a complete and unbiased survey of the soft x - ray spectra of seyfert 1s has yet to be conducted , it does seem highly plausible that all unabsorbed seyfert 1s ( whether nls1 or bls1 ) possess a soft excess .",
    "assuming that there is no fundamental difference in the underlying x - ray continuum spectra of absorbed and unabsorbed seyfert 1s then implies that soft x - ray excesses are ubiquitous to seyfert 1s .",
    "the mini - survey of  spectra by pounds & reeves ( 2002 ) showed that in all six seyfert 1s they studied , the soft x - ray spectrum ( @xmath163  kev ) was always @xmath160 per cent higher than an extrapolation of the hard x - ray power - law would predict .",
    "furthermore , detailed studies of seyfert 1s with complex , strong x - ray warm absorbers often conclude that an additional soft x - ray emission component is required behind the warm absorber ( e.g. collinge 2001 ; netzer 2003 ; blustin 2003 ) .",
    "this therefore underlines the need to understand the soft excess as a common ( perhaps ubiquitous ) and significant contributor to the luminosity of seyferts . in the case of  the best - fitting models",
    "are a doubly - broken power - law with an anomalously flat slope below @xmath164  kev , or multiple , soft blackbodies .",
    "the blackbody origin is difficult to explain as the temperatures are far too high to correspond to any standard accretion disc .",
    "the expected temperature for the inner region ( @xmath165 ) of a geometrically thin , optically thick disc about a @xmath12  black hole is @xmath166  ev if radiating at @xmath167 and @xmath168  ev if radiating at @xmath169 .",
    "this emission should therefore not contribute to the observed x - ray spectrum .",
    "the temperatures of the best - fitting blackbody components were at at least an order of magnitude higher than this .",
    "in addition , the size of the emission region implied by these high temperatures is far too small ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "the alternative models tested ( reflection , disc blackbodies and bremsstrahlung ) all produced the wrong spectral shape .",
    "at present there is no single model that can account for the known properties of the soft excess ( see also the discussion in vaughan 2002 ) .",
