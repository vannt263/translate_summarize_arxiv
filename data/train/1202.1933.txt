    "the understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in the segregation of an intruder in a granular fluid is perhaps one of the most important open challenges of granular flow research .",
    "this problem has spawned a number of important experimental , computational , and theoretical works in the field of granular media @xcite . among the different mechanisms proposed to describe ( size ) segregation ,",
    "thermal diffusion becomes the most relevant if the system fulfills the conditions of a granular gas . in this case , kinetic theory , properly modified to account for the inelasticity of collisions , has proven to be a reliable tool to analyze the dynamics of the intruder .    thermal diffusion ( or thermophoresis in its single - particle manifestation @xcite ) is the transport of matter due to the presence of a thermal gradient . as a result of the motion of the components of the mixture",
    ", a steady state can be reached in which the separating effect arising from thermal diffusion is balanced by the remixing effect of ordinary diffusion . as a consequence , partial segregation is observed and described by the so - called thermal diffusion factor @xmath0 . while this phenomenon has been widely studied in ordinary gases and liquids @xcite , much less is known in the case of granular mixtures .",
    "it must be noted that in the latter case thermal diffusion can appear in vibrated systems even in the absence of an external imposed temperature gradient , as a consequence of inelasticity . in this case ( energy supplied by vertical walls ) , the mean kinetic energy of the grains decays away from the vibrating plate giving rise to a ( granular ) temperature gradient .    in a non - convecting steady state with gradients only along the vertical direction ( @xmath2 axis ) , @xmath0",
    "is defined by the relation @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ( granular ) temperature , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the number densities of the intruder ( or tracer particles in a binary mixture ) and gas particles , respectively .",
    "if one assumes that gravity @xmath7 and the temperature gradient point in parallel directions ( i.e. , the bottom plate is hotter than the top plate , @xmath8 ) , then the intruder rises with respect to the gas particles if @xmath9 while the opposite happens if @xmath10 . when the intruder is larger than the gas particles , the former situation is referred to as the brazil - nut effect ( bne ) while the latter is called the reverse brazil - nut effect ( rbne ) .",
    "therefore , the sign of the thermal diffusion factor provides a criterion for the transition between the bne and the rbne by varying the parameters of the system ( intruder plus granular gas ) .    a segregation criterion based on the knowledge of the factor",
    "@xmath0 has been recently obtained @xcite from a solution of the ( inelastic ) enskog kinetic equation that applies to first order in the spatial gradients ( navier - stokes order ) .",
    "in contrast to previous theoretical attempts @xcite , the approach is not limited to near elastic particles and takes into account the combined effect of thermal gradient and gravity . on the other hand , the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite are based on two simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , although not explicitly stated , they were obtained by neglecting the dependence of the temperature ratio @xmath11 between the intruder and the gas particles on the volume fraction @xmath12 .",
    "this assumption might be more questionable as the gas becomes denser ( see for instance , fig .",
    "[ fign1 ] below ) .",
    "second , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite were derived by using the first sonine approximation to estimate the transport coefficients associated with the mass flux of intruder .",
    "however , recent results @xcite obtained in the tracer limit for an _ undriven _ granular gas clearly show that the accuracy of the first sonine solution can be worsen for small values of the coefficients of restitution and/or disparate values of the mass and size ratios @xcite .",
    "the question arises then as to whether , and if so to what extent , the conclusions drawn from ref .  @xcite may be altered when the above two new ingredients ( density dependence of the temperature ratio and second sonine correction ) are accounted for in the theory . in this paper",
    ", we address this question by determining the thermal diffusion factor from the first and second sonine approximations .",
    "it is important to remark that the density dependence of the temperature ratio affects to both sonine approximations . in this sense , what is new in the present paper is not only that the calculations are carried out to higher orders , but also that the contributions coming from the term @xmath13 are completely accounted for in the first and second sonine solutions .",
    "this fundamental dependence was not considered in the previous works on thermal diffusion for driven @xcite and undriven @xcite granular gases .",
    "as the results show , both improvements ( density dependence of temperature ratio and second sonine correction ) have a major impact on the physics of the system for large mechanical differences between host and intruder particles .",
    "on the other hand , it must be pointed out that the segregation criterion derived here considers the temperature gradient as an input and not created by the inelasticity of grains .",
    "thus , if the temperature gradient has a given form , then the segregation criterion has a resultant form .",
    "however , it is known @xcite for vertically vibrated granular systems that after the decrease in the value of the granular temperature as a function of height above the floor , the temperature profile possesses a minimum above which the temperature _ increases _ as a function of height . thus , given that @xmath14 in eq .",
    ", our segregation criterion can be useful to analyze situations where the system is sufficiently small ( shallow layers ) so that the minimum in the temperature profile is not reached or is very close to the top of the sample .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , the thermal diffusion factor @xmath0 is evaluated in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] by using a hydrodynamic description .",
    "this factor is expressed in terms of the pressure @xmath15 of the gas , the transport coefficients @xmath1 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 associated with the mass flux of intruder , and the ( reduced ) gravity @xmath18 .",
    "as for ordinary gases @xcite , the above transport coefficients obey a set of coupled linear integral equations that can be approximately solved by using a sonine polynomial expansion .",
    "these coefficients are determined in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] by retaining terms up to the second sonine approximation .",
    "some technical details of the calculations are relegated to the appendix [ appa ] . to assess the reliability of the first and second sonine approximations , we compare in sec .",

    "the knowledge of @xmath1 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 allows one to express the factor @xmath0 in terms of the parameter space of the system : the mass ( @xmath19 ) and diameter ( @xmath20 ) ratios , the solid volume fraction @xmath12 and the coefficients of restitution @xmath21 and @xmath22 characterizing dissipation of gas - gas and intruder - gas collisions , respectively . in order to assess the impact of the above parameters on segregation , in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] the form of the bne / rbne phase diagrams in the @xmath23-plane is investigated by varying the parameters of the system in the case of hard spheres with a common coefficient of restitution ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "two different limit situations are mainly analyzed : ( i ) absence of gravity and ( ii ) thermalized systems ( gravity dominates the temperature gradient ) .",
    "the paper is closed in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] with a discussion of the results .",
    "let us consider a binary mixture of inelastic hard disks ( @xmath25 ) or spheres ( @xmath26 ) where the concentration of one of the species ( of mass @xmath27 and diameter @xmath28 ) is very small compared to that of the other ( excess component of mass @xmath29 and diameter @xmath30 ) .",
    "the inelasticity of collisions among gas - gas and intruder - gas is accounted for by ( constant ) coefficients of normal restitution @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the system ( gas plus intruder ) is in presence of the gravitational field @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a positive constant and @xmath33 is the unit vector in the positive direction of the @xmath2 axis .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we consider an inhomogeneous nonconvecting _ steady _ state with only gradients in the @xmath2 direction . since no shearing flows are present , then the pressure tensor @xmath34 of the gas is diagonal , namely , @xmath35 , where @xmath15 is the hydrostatic pressure . in this case",
    ", the momentum balance equation for the gas becomes @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mass density of the gas particles . in the context of the enskog equation , the hydrostatic pressure @xmath15 is given by @xcite , @xmath38,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the contact value of the pair correlation function for the granular gas and @xmath40 n\\sigma^d$ ] is the solid volume fraction . according to the expression ,",
    "the spatial dependence of @xmath15 is through its dependence on the number density @xmath6 ( or equivalently , the volume fraction @xmath12 ) and the granular temperature @xmath4 .",
    "thus , in dimensionless form , eq .   yields @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is a dimensionless parameter measuring the gravity relative to the thermal gradient .",
    "in addition , since the mean flow velocity of the gas vanishes , the mass balance equation for the number density @xmath5 @xcite implies @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the mass flux of intruders .    to close the determination of the thermal diffusion factor @xmath0 , a constitutive equation for the mass flux @xmath46 is needed . to first order in the spatial gradients ( navier - stokes approximation ) , the constitutive equation for the mass flux",
    "@xmath46 is @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the kinetic diffusion coefficient , @xmath16 is the mutual diffusion coefficient , and @xmath17 is the thermal diffusion coefficient .",
    "the condition @xmath45 leads to the relation @xmath49 where we have introduced the reduced transport coefficients @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . here",
    ", @xmath53 is an effective collision frequency .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath0 can be finally obtained from eqs .   and .",
    "the result is @xcite @xmath54 it is quite apparent that in order to assess the impact of the parameters of the system ( masses , sizes and coefficients of restitution ) and the volume fraction @xmath12 on the thermal diffusion @xmath0 , the explicit forms of the diffusion coefficients @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are needed .",
    "this can be achieved by solving the enskog kinetic equation by means of the chapman - enskog method @xcite .",
    "in the tracer limit ( @xmath58 ) , it is expected that the state of the granular gas ( the solvent ) is not affected by the presence of tracer particles and that the mutual interactions of the latter can be neglected as compared with their collisions with the particles of the solvent .",
    "consequently , at a kinetic theory level , the tracer limit implies that the velocity distribution function @xmath59 of the granular gas obeys the ( closed ) nonlinear enskog equation while the velocity distribution function @xmath60 of the intruder obeys the enskog - lorentz equation @xcite .    moreover , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to maintain the granular medium in a fluidized state , an external energy source is coupled to each particle in the form of a thermal bath . here",
    ", we consider the situation of energy supply through random kicks @xcite : the particles of the system are submitted between collisions to an uncorrelated white noise .",
    "this external force is written as @xmath61 , where the corresponding stochastic acceleration @xmath62 is chosen to be the same for the intruder and the gas particles @xcite .",
    "the associated forcing term in the enskog equation is represented by a fokker - planck collision operator @xcite of the form @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the cooling rate associated with the granular temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the generalization of the force to the _ inhomogeneous _ case is essentially a matter of choice and here , for simplicity , we have assumed that the stochastic force has the same form as in the homogeneous case except that now @xmath64 and @xmath4 are in general functions of space and time .",
    "this simple generalization has been widely used for ordinary gases in shearing problems @xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized that this kind of forcing , which has been shown to be relevant for some two - dimensional experimental configurations with a rough piston @xcite , has been usually employed in computer simulations to analyze different problems in the case of monodisperse systems @xcite .",
    "the application of the chapman - enskog method leads to the constitutive equation for the mass flux where the transport coefficients @xmath16 , @xmath1 and @xmath17 are given by @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 as for elastic collisions , the quantities @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations [ see eqs .",
    "( a13)-(a15 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite for the driven case ] .",
    "the standard method consists of approximating the above quantities by maxwellians ( at different temperatures ) times truncated sonine polynomial expansions . for simplicity ,",
    "usually only the lowest sonine polynomial ( first sonine approximation ) is retained @xcite and the results obtained from this simple approach agrees in general well with monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "exceptions to this agreement are extreme mass and size ratios in the range of large inelasticity , although these discrepancies could be mitigated in part if one considers higher - order terms in the sonine polynomial expansion .",
    "this has been recently shown @xcite in the undriven case ( without thermostat ) at the level of the transport coefficient @xmath56 where the second sonine approximation yields a dramatic improvement ( up to 50 % ) over the first sonine approximation for some extreme cases .",

    "it is important to note that , unless the sonine expansion is convergent , the introduction of the second order in the sonine polynomial expansion does not guarantee _ a priori _ the improvement of the analytical results . in order to gauge the theoretical predictions one would have to compare the latter with computer simulations",

    "figure [ fig5 ] shows a phase diagram for @xmath113 and @xmath143 for this limit case .",
    "it is apparent that , in contrast to the case @xmath137 , the rbne regime appears essentially now for both large mass ratio and/or small diameter ratio . regarding the influence of the assumption @xmath139 in the first sonine approximation @xcite and of the order of the sonine approximation used , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows clearly that the form of the phase diagram is practically independent of the approach used since the three curves collapse in a common curve .",
    "next , we analyze the influence of inelasticity on thermal diffusion by considering only the most accurate approach ( the second sonine approximation ) . to illustrate this effect , two values of @xmath21 are considered in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] for @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "we see that , in the absence of gravity , the main effect of collisional dissipation is to reduce the size of the bne , in contrast to what happens for finite concentration @xcite .",
    "in addition , comparison with the results obtained for @xmath144 assuming energy equipartition ( @xmath145 ) shows that the impact of nonequipartition of granular energy on segregation is important ( when @xmath137 ) , especially as the size ratio increases . however , the influence of nonequipartition is smaller than the one previously found from the first sonine approximation ( see for instance , fig .  2 of ref .",
    "moreover , a comparison of the second sonine approximation ( not shown here ) with previous theories @xcite in the limit @xmath141 shows similar discrepancies as those previously reported ( see fig .  4 of ref .",
    "this is consistent with the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the first and second sonine solutions are practically indistinguishable .",
    "in spite of its practical importance , the understanding of particle segregation within polydisperse , rapid granular flows is still an open problem .",
    "this is due essentially to the complexities that arise during the derivation of kinetic theory models .",
    "most of the previous theoretical works are based on theories that consider systems constituted by nearly elastic particles @xcite , assume an equipartition of granular energy @xcite and/or they are restricted to dilute gases @xcite .",
    "this paper has addressed the problem of segregation by thermal diffusion of an intruder in a driven granular gas .",
    "the analysis is based on navier - stokes constitutive equations with diffusion coefficients derived from the revised enskog kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "the theory is not restricted to _ nearly _ elastic spheres , considers the influence of the nonequipartition of granular energy on segregation , and applies to _ moderate _ values of the solid volume fraction .",
    "in addition , in contrast to the previous attempt carried out by one of the authors of the present paper @xcite , the analysis incorporates the density dependence of the temperature ratio ( @xmath13 ) and considers the second sonine approximation ( two polynomials in the sonine polynomial expansion ) to the transport coefficients .",
    "these new results are the most significant contribution of the present work . in this context",
    ", this paper complements and extends previous papers on segregation of an intruder in driven @xcite and undriven @xcite dense granular gases .    in the steady state with gradients only along the vertical direction , the _ sign _ of the thermal diffusion factor @xmath0 [ defined by eq .  ]",
    "provides information on the tendency of the intruder to move towards the colder ( bne ) or hotter ( rbne ) plate .",
    "the factor @xmath0 has been evaluated by following two complementary approaches .",
    "first , by using the momentum balance equation along with the constitutive equation for the mass flux of the intruder , @xmath0 is expressed in terms of the pressure @xmath15 ( and its derivative with respect to the solid volume fraction @xmath12 ) and the transport coefficients @xmath1 , @xmath17 , and @xmath16 .",
    "then , the form of the diffusion transport coefficients has been determined by solving the enskog equation from the chapman - enskog method up to the second sonine approximation .",
    "this finally gives @xmath0 as a function of the mass and the diameter ratios , the volume fraction , the coefficients of restitution and the ( reduced ) gravity @xmath18 ( a parameter measuring the gravity relative to the thermal gradient ) .    in order to check the reliability of the first and second sonine approximations , a comparison with monte carlo simulations of the enskog equation for the kinetic diffusion coefficient",
    "@xmath1 has been performed .",
    "as for undriven gases @xcite , the comparison with simulation data shows the superiority of the second sonine solution over the first one specially when the gas particles are heavier than the intruder .",
    "however , the discrepancies found here between both sonine approximations are less important than those previously reported for undriven systems @xcite .",
    "the condition @xmath124 [ see eq .  ] provides the segregation criterion for the transition bne @xmath146 rbne . a systematic study of the form of the bne / rbne phase diagrams in the mass and diameter ratio plane has been carried out in sec .  [ sec5 ] for hard spheres ( @xmath26 ) in the case of a ( common ) coefficient of restitution @xmath24 . regarding the form of the phase diagrams , we observe first that the impact of the term @xmath13 on the first sonine approximation is very small ( see , for instance , figs .  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] )",
    "so that the conclusions made in ref .",
    "@xcite are not practically altered by the presence of this new term . with respect to the effect of the sonine approximation considered",
    ", the results reported here show that in general the influence of the order of the sonine solution is much more significant in the absence of gravity ( @xmath137 ) than in the opposite limit ( @xmath141 ) , where both approximations yield practically the same diagrams ( see , for instance , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath137 , the first sonine approach clearly overestimates the rbne region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , while it predicts a bigger influence of collisional dissipation on the phase diagram than the one obtained from the second sonine correction ( compare fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite with fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] of the present paper ) .",
    "although the accuracy of the second sonine approximation to the diffusion coefficients has been only tested in the case of the coefficient @xmath1 , it can be reasonably expected that the segregation criterion derived here in the second sonine approximation for a heated gas compares better with computer simulations than segregation criteria from previous works in the navier - stokes domain ( small gradients of density and temperature ) .",
    "a previous comparison @xcite for dilute gases confirms this expectation .",
    "given that the present results apply to moderate densities , it is hoped that this paper could stimulate the performance of such simulations .",
    "an important question addressed partially in this paper is about the convergence of the sonine polynomial expansions considered here .",
    "this is a quite difficult question , specially in the case of granular fluids where the studies of the impact of higher - order terms on transport are more scarce than for ordinary gases . in this latter case , for instance the analysis of transport properties of dense binary mixtures with one tracer component",
    "@xcite indicates that the convergence of the sonine expansion improves significantly with increasing values of the mass ratio @xmath147 .",
    "similar trends have been found here at the level of the tracer diffusion coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of available simulation data for the remaining diffusion transport coefficients @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the driven or undriven cases prevent us to assess the reliability of the first and second sonine approximations .",
    "since those coefficients are also involved in the expression of the thermal diffusion factor @xmath0 , no definitive conclusions on the accuracy of their second sonine forms can be drawn .",
    "however , the results displayed in section [ sec5 ] for thermal diffusion segregation seem to indicate that while the convergence of the sonine expansion for @xmath0 is quite good when @xmath141 ( see for instance fig .  [ fig5 ] where both sonine approaches lead practically to the same phase diagrams ) , it does not happen the same for a low - density gas in the opposite limit ( @xmath137 ) since there is an abrupt change in the form of the phase diagram for bne / rbne ( see for instance fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "in this situation one should perhaps consider higher - order polynomial terms ( even beyond the second sonine approximation ) or one should consider alternative analytical routes , such as the so - called modified sonine approximation @xcite .",
    "this latter method is based on a modified version of the first sonine approximation which replaces the gaussian distribution weight function ( used in the standard sonine method ) by the homogeneous cooling state distribution . in any case , more comparisons between segregation results derived in the driven case between computer simulations and the different approximate theories are needed before quantitative conclusions can be offered on the reliability of those kinetic theories .",
