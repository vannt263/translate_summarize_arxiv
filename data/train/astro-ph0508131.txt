    "line - of - sight velocity distributions are efficient probes of the dynamical structure of galaxies , and can be used to derive the mass distribution , intrinsic shape and the motions of stars and gas .",
    "non - axisymmetric components such as bars , or external triggers , can lead to significant galaxy evolution via , e.g. , redistribution of the angular momentum , triggering of star formation , or building of a central mass concentration ( e.g. , shloshman 1989 ; knapen 2000 ) .",
    "much can be learned about these processes by simultaneously studying both the stellar and gas dynamics of nearby galaxies by means of integral - field spectroscopy .",
    "here we summarize such a study for the spiral galaxy ngc  5448 , which was observed with sauron  as part of a representative survey of 72 nearby early - type galaxies ( de zeeuw 2002 ; falcn  barroso et al.2005 ) . a more comprehensive report can be found in fathi ( 2005 ) .",
    "we observed ngc  5448 with sauron  on april 14th 2004 .",
    "detailed specifications for the instrument , reduction procedure , and the data preparation procedure can be found in bacon ( 2001 ) ; emsellem ( 2004 ) ; sarzi ( 2005 ) . the sauron  flux map in fig .",
    "[ fig : datamaps ] displays a smooth stellar distribution and the presence of prominent dust lanes to the south of the nucleus .",
    "the stellar kinematics shows a global disk - like rotation with a smaller inner stellar disk within the central 7  radius . along the strong dust lanes",
    ", the gas shows a patchy distribution , with an asymmetric elongation of [ o@xmath0iii ]  gas towards the east as well as the galactic poles .",
    "the gas velocity map clearly shows a prominent ` s'-shaped zero - velocity curve with sharp edges indicating very strong non - circular gas motions .",
    "in order to study the gas velocity field , we apply the tilted - ring decomposition combined with the harmonic expansion formalism from schoenmakers ( 1997 ) .",
    "this formalism allows us to extract the gaseous kinematic information such as the rotation curve , kinematic position angle variation , and higher harmonic terms .",
    "wong ( 2004 ) derived the higher - order harmonics for an axisymmetric potential with an @xmath1 bar perturbation .",
    "this bar model depends on a set of parameters describing the potential , as well as the viewing angle .",
    "we construct libraries of models with different input parameters , and find that we can describe our observed velocity field with the bar model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : analysis ] .",
    "thus , the radial motions of the gas are associated with that of the large - scale bar ( see fathi 2005 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "ngc  5448 exhibits clear signatures of the presence of other components than a single bar , which affect the observed velocity field . inspecting the photometry and the central parts of the gaseous and stellar velocity field , we find signatures of a central stellar disk embedded in the larger disk ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : diskmodel ] ) .",
    "we approximate the stellar velocity field with an exponential thin disk to emphasize the kinematic signatures of the central disk .",
    "[ fig : diskmodel ] illustrates our simple inclined disk model , after subtraction of which we find that the inner stellar disk - like component rotates faster than the outer disk .",
    "fitting also an exponential disk to the region interior to the 7   radius , we find that the central disk - like structure is misaligned with respect to the outer disk by @xmath2 .",
    "the stellar kinematic maps show that the central disk rotates faster than the main disk , and our observed gas distribution and kinematics indicate that this central disk also hosts gas which rotates faster than its stellar counterpart .",
    "it is known that bars are efficient in transferring mass towards the inner regions of their host galaxies .",
    "the centrally concentrated matter may be able to form a secondary bar or a central disk .",
    "our analysis shows that the non - circular gas kinematics in ngc  5448 could be driven by the large - scale bar .",
    "the central disk could then have been formed as a result of the gas accumulation at the centre .",
    "+    it is a pleasure to acknowledge the entire sauron  team for their efforts in carrying out the observations and data preparation and for many fruitful discussions .",
    "kf thanks the conference organizers for all their efforts ."
