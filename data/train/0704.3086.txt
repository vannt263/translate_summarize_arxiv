    "gradient fields belong to a class of models that arise in equilibrium statistical mechanics , for example , as approximations of critical systems and as effective interface models .",
    "although their definition is rather simple and , in fact , quite a lot is known ( see the reviews by funaki @xcite , velenik @xcite or sheffield @xcite ) , there is still much to be learned . in this note , we study gradient fields on a lattice . here , the field is a collection of real - valued random variables @xmath6 and the distribution of @xmath7 on @xmath8 is given by the formal expression @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the lebesgue measure , @xmath11 refers to an unordered nearest - neighbor pair on @xmath12 and @xmath2 is an even , measurable function , called the _ potential _ , which is bounded from below and grows superlinearly at @xmath13 .    of course",
    ", to define the measure ( [ grad - field ] ) precisely , we have to restrict the above expression to a finite subset of @xmath12 and fix the @xmath7 s on its boundary ; @xmath14 is then the normalizing constant .",
    "another way to regularize the expression ( [ grad - field ] ) is to consider directly measures on all of @xmath8 whose conditional probabilities in finite sets take the above form . in our context , this standard definition is hampered by the fact that , due to the unbounded nature of the fields @xmath15 , no such infinite - volume measures may exist at all .",
    "however , if one restricts attention to ( the @xmath16-algebra generated by ) the gradient variables @xmath17 then infinite - volume measures exist under the above conditions on @xmath2 .",
    "since the measure depends only on gradients , we refer to such measures as _ gradient gibbs measures _ ( ggm ) , in accordance with funaki @xcite and sheffield @xcite .    throughout",
    ", we will focus on translation - invariant ggms .",
    "an important characteristic is their _",
    "tilt_. for a translation - invariant ggm @xmath18 , there exists a unique tilt vector @xmath19 such that @xmath20 for every edge @xmath21 of @xmath12 , which we regard as a vector in this formula .",
    "of course , this definition is only really meaningful for the ggms that are ergodic , that is , trivial on the @xmath22-algebra of events invariant under all lattice translations .",
    "indeed , in the ergodic case , @xmath23 represents the average incline of typical configurations .    for the case of quadratic @xmath2 , the _ massless free field _ , the measure ( [ grad - field ] ) is gaussian and so many desired characteristics are amenable to explicit computations .",
    "the challenge for mathematicians has been to develop an equivalent level of understanding for nonquadratic @xmath2 s .",
    "a good amount of progress in this direction has been made in the last ten to fifteen years : brydges and yau @xcite ( and also earlier works , e.g. , by gawdzki and kupiainen @xcite and magnen and snor @xcite ) studied the effect of analytic perturbations of the quadratic potentials and concluded that the large - scale behavior is that of the massless free field .",
    "naddaf and spencer @xcite proved the same nonperturbatively for strictly convex potentials @xmath2 and ggms with zero tilt .",
    "the corresponding extension to nonzero tilt was obtained by giacomin , olla and spohn @xcite .",
    "for the same class of potentials , funaki and spohn @xcite proved a bijection between the ergodic ggms and their tilt .",
    "sheffield @xcite characterized translation - invariant ggms by means of a gibbs variational principle and extended funaki and spohn s results to fields taking only a discrete set of values .",
    "we refer to the reviews by funaki @xcite , velenik @xcite and sheffield @xcite for further results and references .    as a unifying feature , all the ( nonperturbative )",
    "results mentioned are based on the strict convexity of the potential @xmath2 , be it for the use of the brascamp ",
    "lieb inequality @xcite , helffer  sjstrand random walk representation @xcite , coupling to langevin dynamics @xcite and the cluster - swapping algorithm @xcite .",
    "one would naturally like to have a nonperturbative approach that works even for nonconvex potentials . with this motivation ,",
    "biskup and koteck @xcite recently studied the ggms for nonconvex @xmath2 that are a log - mixture of centered gaussians , @xmath24 where @xmath4 is a positive measure with compact support in @xmath25 .",
    "surprisingly , already for the simplest nontrivial case , @xmath26 with @xmath27 , it was shown that , in @xmath28 , there is a value @xmath29 at which one can construct _ two _ distinct , translation - invariant , gradient gibbs measures of zero tilt .",
    "the relevant conclusion from @xcite for the general theory is that the one - to - one correspondence between ergodic ggms and their tilt breaks down once @xmath2 is sufficiently nonconvex . the next question which naturally arises is how to understand what happens to the scaling limit .",
    "the purpose of this note is to show that , regardless of the occurrence of phase transitions , for potentials of the form ( [ v - repr ] ) , every translation - invariant , ergodic ggm with zero tilt scales to a gaussian free field ( gff ) .    the proof is based on the fact  utilized already in @xcite  that ( [ v - repr ] ) allows us to represent every ggm as a mixture over gaussian gradient measures with a random coupling constant @xmath30 for each edge @xmath11 .",
    "its covariance is simply the inverse of the operator @xmath31,\\ ] ] where we take , once and for all , @xmath32 .",
    "fluctuations _ in the gaussian measure can be analyzed by invoking a random walk representation ; @xmath33 is the generator of a random walk with symmetric random jump rates , known , equivalently , as a _ random conductance model_. the name arises naturally from the electrostatic interpretation of this problem ( cf .",
    "doyle and snell @xcite , in which one views @xmath12 as a resistor network with _ conductance _",
    "@xmath30or resistivity @xmath34assigned to an edge @xmath11 ) . as it turns out",
    "( see lemma [ lemma - ergodic ] ) , if the initial ggm is ergodic , then so is the law of the conductances .",
    "this makes homogenization a possible tool .",
    "much work has been done in the past two decades on the problem of random walks with random conductances . for our purposes",
    ", it suffices to invoke two known results : kipnis and varadhan s @xcite invariance principle ( i.e. , scaling of the random walk to brownian motion ) and delmotte and deuschel s @xcite annealed derivative heat kernel bounds .",
    "( note that in the helffer  sjstrand random walk representation , as used in @xcite , one also has to study a random walk in a random environment .",
    "however , this random environment fluctuates in time , while , in our case , it is static . )",
    "this takes care of the fluctuations of the field ; an important technical issue is thus the control of the mean .",
    "this is where the zero - tilt restriction comes in ( see lemma [ lemma - gaussian ] , corollary [ cor - tilt ] and discussion in section [ sec7 ] ) .",
    "while this paper has been in the process of revision , further developments have occurred in the study of gradient models with nonconvex potentials .",
    "cotar , deuschel and mller @xcite have shown that for nonconvex perturbations of potentials @xmath2 where the size of the nonconvex region is small compared to typical fluctuations of the field , the conclusions are as in the convex case .",
    "( their precise condition is a bound on the @xmath35-norm of the negative part of the second derivative . )",
    "this is a high - temperature result ; work in progress by adams , koteck and mller @xcite addresses the low - temperature case when nonconvexities are allowed only sufficiently far away from the absolute minimum of @xmath2 .",
    "our contribution remains valuable despite these advances as it applies to all potentials of the type ( [ v - repr ] ) , including those for which phase coexistence occurs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we precisely define the concept of the gradient gibbs measure and state our main theorem . in section [ sec3 ] , we introduce the extended gradient gibbs measures and characterize their conditional marginals .",
    "this will naturally lead to the aforementioned connections with random walks in reversible random environments . to keep the main line of the argument intact ,",
    "we first finish proving our main result in section [ sec4 ] and only then expound on the random walk connections in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "section [ sec7 ] is devoted to the discussion of the limitations to zero tilt and some open questions concerning gradient gibbs measures .",
    "as mentioned above , infinite - volume measures on the field variables @xmath36 may not always exist , particularly in sufficiently low dimensions . to make our statements uniform in dimension , we will focus attention on the gradient variables . however , not even that will be entirely straightforward because the gradient variables satisfy a host of `` hard - core '' constraints which , in a sense , encapsulate most of the interaction . since @xmath37 is gradient , one has @xmath38 whenever @xmath39 are the vertices of a cycle in @xmath12 of length four",

    "@xcite , remark 4.9 ) .",
    "the restriction to zero tilt is actually a significant drawback of our analysis .",

    "+ moreover , by theorem 2.5 of @xcite , for @xmath131 , the transition in the @xmath28 model with ( [ two - deltas ] ) lies on a self - dual line , that is , @xmath132 the transition presumably stays on this line even as one slides the ratio @xmath133 toward one .",
    "however , it disappears before @xmath133 hits one because , for @xmath134 , the potential @xmath2 is convex and so there is only one ggm with zero tilt @xcite .",
    "at such a point of disappearance , physicists often expect nontrivial critical fluctuations .",

    "this definition is appealing in @xmath125 , where the limiting functional @xmath97 actually admits the integral representation @xmath135 with @xmath136 denoting a continuous diffusion with generator @xmath137 , but in @xmath126 , the corresponding field becomes less and less regular with increasing dimension and the appeal is lost .",
    "however , this context would be ideal if one wished to discuss the notion of tightness and convergence in law for the limit in theorem [ thm - main ] .",
    "both lemma [ lemma - cont ] and theorem [ thm - main ] are proved in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the key idea underlying the representation ( [ v - repr ] ) is that the auxiliary variable @xmath138 in the expression for @xmath2 may be elevated to a genuine degree of freedom associated with the corresponding edge .",

    "however , @xmath302 is also harmonic and so , in turn , lemma [ lemma - divergence ] forces @xmath488 .",
    "thus , @xmath489 , as desired .",
    "recall that @xmath449 is the extension of @xmath490 subject to the condition @xmath451 . with this object at hand",

    "the proofs in the present note often rely on the fact that the random walk with generator @xmath33 is uniformly elliptic .",
    "this enters via the assumption that @xmath4 , defining the potential @xmath2 , has support bounded away from zero .",
    "while we believe that the general picture carries over , even if we let the support extend all the way to zero , a number of steps in the proof become quite subtle . for instance , the pointwise heat kernel asymptotic for this walk may take a radically different form ( berger et al .",

    ", the desired result requires that the resistivities @xmath504 exhibit a specific correlation decay @xcite , theorem 7.6 .",
    "very little information concerning this is known in @xmath505 ; see mourrat @xcite for some recent progress in this direction .",
    "our final remark concerns a generalization to potentials @xmath2 , where ( [ v - repr ] ) has been modified to @xmath506 with @xmath507 denoting a family of strictly convex , even , measurable functions with uniformly superlinear growth at @xmath13 and a uniform lower bound . in this case",
