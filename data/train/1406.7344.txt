    "<S> twisted - bilayer graphene ( tblg ) exhibits van hove singularities in the density of states that can be tuned by changing the twisting angle @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath0-engineered optical response is shown to be consistent with persistent saddle - point excitons . </S>",
    "<S> separate resonances with stokes and anti - stokes raman scattering components can be achieved due to the sharpness of the two - dimensional saddle - point excitons , similar to what has been previously observed for one - dimensional carbon nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation power dependence for the stokes and anti - stokes emissions indicate that the two processes are correlated and that they share the same phonon .    </S>",
    "<S> * keywords * : graphene , raman scattering , optical reflectivity    saddle points in the electron dispersion of two - dimensional systems generate logarithmic diverging van - hove singularities ( vhs ) in the density of states ( dos ) @xcite . in single - layer graphene ( fig.[figmpoint]a ) , the vhs occur at the m point for both the valence ( @xmath1 ) and conduction ( @xmath2 ) bands ( fig.[figmpoint]b ) , and consequently in the joint density of sates ( jdos ) for optical properties . </S>",
    "<S> the jdos vhs falls into the ultra - violet frequency region in graphene @xcite , as well as the related peak in the optical conductivity ( @xmath3 ) , which is redshifter from the jdos vhs due to excitonic effects @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> twisted - bilayer graphene ( tblg ) are formed by adding a twist angle @xmath0 between two graphene layers on top of each other  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the expansion of the real lattice parameter when building a superstructured tblg ( see arrow in fig.[figmpoint]c ) generates a shrinking of the reciprocal space ( fig.[figmpoint]d ) , thus bringing the dirac ( k and k@xmath4 ) points close together and moving them closer to the m saddle point . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the vhs will shift in energy , thereby redshifting the jdos vhs to visible frequencies and even into the far - infrared , depending on the twisting angle @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this effect has been measured in tblg using scanning tunneling spectroscopy @xcite and it has been explored using raman spectroscopy @xcite .    up to date , the studied tblgs have been produced randomly , i.e. without controlling the twist angle @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the generated 2d vhs have been directly measured only by scanning tunneling spectroscopy@xcite , which is limited to energies near the fermi level and is usually more invasive and less accurate than optical measurements . here </S>",
    "<S> we report the production and optical characterization of a tblg with a previously selected @xmath0 angle , chosen specifically to explore stokes and anti - stokes resonance raman scattering effects . by mode </S>",
    "<S> - engineering the system to work in resonance with the anti - stokes line , we observe a quadratic power dependence of the anti - stokes process . </S>",
    "<S> this power dependence is indicative of stokes - induced anti - stokes scattering in which the phonon generated by the stokes scattering is consumed by the anti - stokes process .     and @xmath2 electrons at the edge of the brillouin zone , close to the dirac ( k and k@xmath4 ) and saddle ( m ) points @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> our tblg sample was prepared from mechanically - exfoliated single - layer graphene flakes with well - defined edges ( see fig.[figsample]a , b ) . </S>",
    "<S> after a first graphene flake had been transferred on top of a solid sio@xmath9 surface , a second flake is put down , rotated with respect to the first by an angle @xmath10 . then the @xmath10 tblg was transferred onto a 500 nm thick sin@xmath11 membrane perforated with holes of 10@xmath12 m diameter ( see optical image in fig.[figsample]c and schematics in fig.[figsample]d ) . notice </S>",
    "<S> that while well - defined edges are a sufficient indication of armchair or zigzag atomic structures , they can not be differentiated optically , and the procedure here has 50% chance of generating a ( @xmath13 ) angle , rather than the wanted @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also fabricated a reference sample with @xmath14 by directly depositing a mechanically exfoliated ab - stacked bilayer graphene ( ab - blg ) . </S>",

    "<S> the twisted bilayer graphene ( tblg ) is then deposited on top of a si substrate with a 500 nm thick layer of sin@xmath11 , perforated with @xmath15-diameter holes ( optical image in ( c ) and schematics in ( d)).,width=340 ]    figure[figreflectivity ] shows the reflectivity of the tblg shown in fig.[figsample]c , measured with a supercontinuum laser and normalized to the response of the ab - blg . </S>",
    "<S> the tblg reflectivity peak is observed at @xmath16 , in excellent agreement with the prediction for @xmath17 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetric reflectivity lineshape observed in the ultra - violet for graphene has been identified as a result of the convolution between a well - defined ( excitonic ) transition with a continuum density of electronic states , which results in a fano resonance feature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetric lineshape shown in fig.[figreflectivity ] is fully consistent with this picture , showing that many - body effects leading to the formation of two - dimensional saddle - point excitons are persistent , remaining in the modified structure of tblg .    </S>",

    "<S> c the samples were excited with the hene laser at @xmath19ev ( @xmath20 nm ) , while in fig.[figraman]b , d the samples were excited with a frequency doubled yag laser at @xmath18ev ( @xmath21 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> these two laser energies are marked in fig.[figreflectivity ] by the vertical dashed lines . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the two lasers are off resonance with respect to the saddle - point exciton , @xmath22 being blue- or red - shifted from @xmath3 by approximately the g band phonon energy ( @xmath23ev ) .    </S>",

    "<S> all spectra have been acquired with @xmath245mw reaching the sample through an air objective ( na = 0.8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the signal is collected in transmission by another air objective with larger na (= 0.9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the stokes spectra are displayed down to 1200@xmath25 to highlight the absence of the disorder - induced ( d ) band . </S>",
    "<S> the insets show the respective second - order g@xmath4 ( or 2d ) bands , characteristic for ab - stacked ( a , b ) and misoriented ( c , d ) bilayer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the anti - stokes signals are magnified for clarity ( magnification indicated on top of the respective peaks ) . </S>",
    "<S> all spectra have been corrected to account for detector ( charged coupled device from excelon - pixis 100b ) and spectrometer ( acton sp2300 from princeton instruments , equipped with a 600groves / mm grating blazed at 750 nm ) nominal efficiencies.,width=264 ]    in the ab - blg case ( fig.[figraman]a , b ) , the stokes and anti - stokes signals do not change significantly when changing the excitation laser energy . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra obtained with @xmath19ev and @xmath18ev are similar ( see fig.[figraman]a , b ) , and the @xmath26 ratio is basically unchanged . however , in the case of tblg , the spectra change significantly when changing the excitation laser energy . </S>",
    "<S> figure[figraman]c shows a stokes signal @xmath2710 times stronger than the average signal obtained from the ab - blg . </S>",
    "<S> figure[figraman]d , on the other hand , shows an anti - stokes signal @xmath2710 times stronger than in the ab - blg . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath26 ratio thus changes by two orders of magnitude when changing the measurements with @xmath19ev and @xmath18ev . </S>",
    "<S> this result happens because , while the @xmath19ev laser leads to a resonance with the anti - stokes photon emission , the @xmath18ev laser rise to a resonance with the stokes photon emission . </S>",
    "<S> similar results were observed in one - dimensional ( 1d ) carbon nanotubes @xcite , where sharp resonances are characteristics of the 1d band structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , similar effect can be observed in a two - dimensional graphene system due to the sharp saddle - point exciton resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> notice that in figure[figraman]d , the anti - stokes g band signal intensity is close to the stokes intensity . </S>",
    "<S> although similar result has been observed in carbon nanotubes before @xcite , an important question remains : where do these high energy g band phonons , which are being annihilated in the highly efficient resonant anti - stokes emission , come from ? to answer this question , we refer to the feynman diagrams shown in figure[figfeinman ] . </S>",
    "<S> the s diagram shows the stokes raman scattering event where a phonon and a stokes - shifted raman photon are generated . </S>",
    "<S> the as diagram shows the anti - stokes raman scattering process , where one existing phonon is annihilated , generating the anti - stokes shifted raman photon . </S>",
    "<S> the as process depends on the previous existence of the phonon in the lattice . in the case of graphene </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath23ev is much higher then the thermal ( room temperature ) energy . </S>",
    "<S> the last diagram in figure[figfeinman ] , which we call here the stokes - anti - stokes ( sas ) event , describes a non - linear process where a phonon created by the stokes process is subsequently annihilated in the anti - stokes process . </S>",
    "<S> the stokes and anti - stokes photons emerging from the sas event can be correlated and , as discussed by d. n. klyshko @xcite , the character of this correlation can be continuously varied from purely quantum to purely classical . in order to observe the sas scattering , </S>",
    "<S> we need to efficiently consume photo - generated phonons in the anti - stokes process . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the phonons will decohere via scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we also need high energy optical phonons that are unlikely to be populated at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these constrains are achieved in our @xmath0-defined tblg system .        to differentiate the anti - stokes signal originated from the sas event from that produced by the usual as process </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the excitation laser power ( @xmath28 ) dependence of the anti - stokes raman intensity ( @xmath29 ) . considering both the as and sas events in fig.[figfeinman ] separately </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath29 assumes the form : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are constants and @xmath33 $ ] is the temperature dependent bose - einstein phonon distribution function . in the thermal regime , the dependence of @xmath29 on @xmath28 reflects the material temperature through @xmath34 . in the regime where the sas event dominates , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 is proportional to @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure[figanal ] shows the power dependence of the stokes ( a ) and anti - stokes ( b ) signals from the tblg ( blue ) and from the ab - blg ( red ) , when excited with @xmath19ev . </S>",
    "<S> the intensities are normalized by the excitation laser power . </S>",
    "<S> figure[figanal]a shows that the stokes signal scales linearly with excitation power for both samples , which is indicative for the spontaneous scattering regime . </S>",
    "<S> however , the anti - stokes raman signals of the two samples show markedly different behaviors ( fig.[figanal]b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the anti - stokes intensity of the tblg excited at @xmath19ev shows a quadratic power dependence within the measured range ( 0 - 10mw , blue data in fig.[figanal]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data can be accurately fitted by eq.[eq1 ] considering @xmath34 constant at @xmath36k , with @xmath37w@xmath38s@xmath38 and @xmath39w@xmath40s@xmath38 . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the power - normalized anti - stokes intensity from the ab - blg reference standard shows a much less pronounced @xmath41 enhancement within the measured range ( see red data in fig.[figanal]b ) , with a clear non - linear power dependence behavior ( see inset ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ab - blg @xmath41 data can be fit with @xmath42w@xmath38s@xmath38 , assuming that the temperature depends linearly on the excitation laser power as @xmath43 , with @xmath44mw@xmath38k and @xmath45 . according with this latest equation , for @xmath46,mw the ab - blg temperature crosses 600@xmath47c . the ab - blg sample burns for laser powers above 12mw , while the tblg stands much higher powers , evidencing the cooling process induced by the efficient anti - stokes resonant emission . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to comment , however , that the presence of some heating in the tblg or the sas event in the ab - blg reference sample can not be ruled out from the results shown here , since a relatively small non - zero temperature increase for tblg or @xmath32 term for ab - blg can be added to the fitting curves without significantly compromising the fitting qualities .    ) and ( b ) anti - stokes ( @xmath29 ) raman intensities for the tblg ( blue ) and ab - blg ( red ) obtained with @xmath19ev . </S>",
    "<S> the g band peaks were fit with a lorentzian function . </S>",
    "<S> the raman intensities were obtained from the peak integrated areas and then normalized by the laser power ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) to clearly demonstrate the difference in behavior . </S>",
    "<S> circles are experimental data and lines are fitting functions according to eq.[eq1 ] ( see text for fitting values ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in ( b ) is a magnified version of the ab - blg data.,width=264 ]    the sas process has been measured in diamond @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments were carried out in the femtosecond pump regime , where the extremely high number of photons per pulse significantly enhances the sas probability . </S>",
    "<S> it is surprising that our results indicate the observation of the sas event in graphene with a significantly low power from a cw laser . </S>",
    "<S> lee _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite demonstrated the quantum nature of the sas correlation in bulk diamond at room temperature by measuring a non - classical sas second - order time correlation function @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this type of measurement has to be developed in graphene , so that the correlation nature of the sas event , as proposed by d. n. klyshko @xcite and observed for bulk diamond @xcite , could be explored .    </S>",
    "<S> we expect the sas event also to play a role in other low dimensional materials , like in carbon nanotubes . </S>",

    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite observed laser - induced phonon cooling in single - wall carbon nanotubes by introducing them into an external optical cavity . </S>",
    "<S> they discussed how this scheme can be used to remove high energy hot phonons , which play an important role in the thermal and electrical properties of low - dimensional structures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we designed a system that can perform like a cooling system , but the nanostructure itself is the cavity . because of the m - point engineering scheme used to build the tblg </S>",
    "<S> , the resonance can be tuned to work at any selected wavelength from the far - infrared up to the ultra - violet , in the amplifying or cooling mode , just by changing the tblg angle @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> also , multiple twisted bilayer graphenes can be stacked ( separated for example by hexagonal - bn ) to enhance the efficiency further .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , since raman spectroscopy is established as an important tool to study and characterize nanostructures , our findings indicate that the sas event has to be considered when using this technique to extract structural and transport properties of low - dimensional structures . in future work </S>",
    "<S> it will be interesting to study changes of the phonon ( g band ) linewidth and frequency as a function of detuning ( @xmath51 ) , which may change the influence of the kohn anomaly @xcite effects in the g band properties . </S>"
