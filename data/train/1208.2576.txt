    "the stationary ( @xmath12 ) and non - interacting spin - susceptibility function , @xmath65 , is given in eq .",
    "when the fermi - energy is at the hexagonal range and @xmath20 is close to one of nesting vectors , one of the eigenvalues of @xmath66 becomes much larger than the other two .",
    "we denote the largest eigenvalue of @xmath66 as @xmath67 .",
    "we found that @xmath67 is maximized at the nesting vectors of the fermi - surface .",
    "now , we would like the examine the temperature dependence of @xmath67 . in order to do so , we set @xmath19 . the ratio of @xmath68 and @xmath69 as a function of the temperature appears in fig .",
    "( [ fig : x_temp ] ) , where the temperature is measured in terms of @xmath70 .",
    "clearly , the susceptibility increases as the temperature decreases .",
    "however , it remains finite for all temperatures .",
    "the critical interaction strength scales as @xmath71 , hence , its zero - temperature values are doubled at @xmath26 .",
    "the values of @xmath72 at the other two nesting vectors are identical to fig .",
    "( [ fig : x_temp ] ) due to symmetry considerations . for other @xmath20 vectors ,",
    "the values of @xmath72 are different but the temperature dependence is similar .",
    "the magnetization of a skyrmion - lattice is : @xmath73 where the summation is over the nesting vectors @xmath74 , @xmath75 are the eigenvectors of the spin - susceptibility , @xmath76 is the total amplitude of the skyrmion - lattice and @xmath77 is the phase of each sdw .",

    "( [ mag ] ) as an expectation value of @xmath78 is : @xmath79 where @xmath43 are the fourier components of @xmath44 , and @xmath80 is the non - interacting part which can be approximated by the fu model .",
    "( [ h_mf ] ) can be solved numerically via bloch theorem .",
    "that introduces a band structure and a set of eigenvectors , @xmath81 , at each point in the lattice brillouin zone .",
    "the chern - number calculation can be done numerically by defining the projection matrix , @xmath82 , and using : @xmath83)\\ ] ] in order to perform the calculation , we must set the parameters of the problem .",
    "in particular , we must choose the exact form of the magnetization by setting the amplitude , @xmath76 , and the phases , @xmath84 , in eq .",
    "( [ mag ] ) .",
    "we found numerically that for any non - zero value of the amplitude @xmath76 , a gap is opened at the fermi - energy .",
    "hence , any two states with two different positive ( or two different negative ) values of @xmath76 can be connected continuously without closing the gap .",
    "consequently , they must share the same chern - number .",
    "moreover , two states that differ only in the sign of @xmath76 are two time - reversal - partners and therefore their chern - numbers are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign .",
    "hence , we conclude that the chern - number of the system can not depend on the magnitude of @xmath85 , and that the sign of @xmath76 affects only the sign of the chern - number . for that reason , we can choose a specific value of @xmath76 without losing the generality .",
    "for the actual calculation , we chose @xmath86 and @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the appropriate critical interaction .",
    "we set @xmath76 to be positive such that @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the average magnetic energy per unit - cell : @xmath91 where the integration is over a lattice unit - cell and @xmath92 is a unit - cell area .    the phases , @xmath84 , determine the origin of the skyrmion - lattice",
    ". clearly , the spectrum and the chern - numbers are independent of these phases .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , we set all the phases to be zero .",
    "after the determination of @xmath93 , @xmath25 and the exact form of @xmath40 , the numerical calculation of the chern - number is a straightforward task .",

    "<S> in this work we analyze the instability conditions for spin - density - waves ( sdw ) formation on the surface of strong topological insulators . we find that for a certain range of fermi - energies and strength of interactions the sdw state is favored compared to the unmagnetized and the uniform - magnetization states . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the sdw are of spiral nature and for a certain range of parameters a skyrmion - lattice may form on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this phase may have a non trivial chern - number even in the absence of an external magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> the gapless surface states of strong topological insulators have drawn a great deal of attention over the past few years . </S>",
    "<S> these metallic states arise from a topologically non - trivial band structure @xcite and are protected as long as time reversal symmetry is maintained . </S>",
    "<S> this topological feature may lead to novel quantum states on the surface of these materials , such as majorana fermions and fractional excitations @xcite .    in a previous work @xcite it was shown that for a strong enough electron - electron interaction , both of the short range and the coulomb types , the surface of a strong topological insulator is unstable to the formation of spontaneous uniform magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> other works @xcite suggested that a spin - density - wave state ( sdw ) is likely to occur due to a strong fermi - surface nesting . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we explore the conditions under which the sdw state is favored over the unmagnetized and the uniform - magnetization states . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find that for a certain range of parameters , a skyrmion - lattice may form on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> we also elaborate on the topological properties of this phase and claim that a network of one - dimensional chiral channels can be established on the surface .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by analyzing the spin - susceptibility function . </S>",
    "<S> the non - interacting hamiltonian of a @xmath0 topological insulator surface can be approximated by the fu model @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 are the pauli matrices , @xmath4 is the electron velocity near the dirac point and @xmath5 is the warping parameter which originated from the cubic dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling of the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : fu_h ] ) introduces an energy scale , @xmath6 . the fermi - surface , arising from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : fu_h ] ) , can be classified to three regions @xcite . a circular region for @xmath7 , a hexagonal region for @xmath8 and a snowflake region for @xmath9 . usually , the snowflake region coexists with the bulk states and therefore it is less interesting . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we assume that the fermi - energy lies in the circular or the hexagonal regions .    </S>",
    "<S> we denote the energies and normalized eigenstates of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : fu_h ] ) as @xmath10 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the stationary ( @xmath12 ) and non - interacting spin - susceptibility function is given by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fermi - dirac function at temperature @xmath15 with fermi - energy @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues of @xmath18 , for @xmath19 , as a function of the fermi - energy are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig1 ] ) . clearly , as the fermi energy increases , one of the eigenvalues becomes much larger than the other two . </S>",
    "<S> the maximal eigenvalue as a function of @xmath20 , for a fixed fermi - energy in the hexagonal region , is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the susceptibility is maximized at the nesting vectors of the fermi - surface in the hexagonal region .    by analyzing the susceptibility as a function of the temperature ( see supplementary ) , we find that the susceptibility increases dramatically as the temperature decreases . </S>",
    "<S> however , it remains finite for all temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this feature arises from the fact that the fermi - surface is not perfectly nested , otherwise we would expect the susceptibility to diverge at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the landau free - energy up to a second order , with the magnetization , @xmath21 , as an order parameter , is given by : @xmath22 without interactions , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig1 ] ) , the eigenvalues of the susceptibility are non - negative . </S>",
    "<S> hence , eq .  ( [ eq : fl ] ) is minimized by @xmath23 for every @xmath20 . however , in the presence of a contact interaction , the susceptibility can be expressed in terms of the non - interacting susceptibility using the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , @xmath24^{\\rho\\nu}$ ] , where @xmath25 is the contact - interaction strength . since the non - interacting susceptibility is finite for all temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a critical interaction at which one of the eigenvalues of the susceptibility becomes negative exists for all temperatures . above that critical value </S>",
    "<S> a second order phase transition to a sdw ground state occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the zero - temperature critical interaction for a formation of a sdw ground state as a function of the fermi - energy , as calculated in the rpa , appears in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the uniform state is favored . </S>",
    "<S> as the fermi - energy increases to the hexagonal range , the nesting becomes stronger and the sdw state is favored compared to the uniform one . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the values of the critical interaction for a formation of a sdw ground state are quite sensitive to temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the zero temperature values in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig3 ] ) are doubled at @xmath26 .    above the critical interaction </S>",
    "<S> a non - uniform magnetization will occur on the surface . by denoting the normalized eigenvectors of the susceptibility as @xmath27 , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization becomes @xmath28    since all the eigenvectors of the susceptibility contain both real and imaginary parts , each @xmath20 contributes to the magnetization a spiral sdw propagating in the @xmath20 direction . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the sdw is almost constant and its direction varies continuously in space . </S>",
    "<S> the relative phase between each pair of sdw , @xmath29 , is physical . </S>",
    "<S> only two of these relative phases are independent , and choosing them is equivalent to choosing the origin of the sdw . </S>",
    "<S> this freedom will be manifested as goldstone modes ( phonons ) .    near the phase transition , </S>",
    "<S> only the nesting vectors @xmath30 will contribute to the magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> however , these sdw do not necessarily coexist . </S>",
    "<S> the landau free - energy up to a fourth order is : @xmath31 are four - spin correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , by tuning the ratio between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the system can change its phase from a phase where all the spin - spirals coexist , to a stripes phase where only one of the spin - spiral has a magnitude that is different from zero . </S>",
    "<S> in general , @xmath32 and @xmath33 depend on the dimensionless parameter @xmath34 and on the dimensionless fermi - energy ( @xmath35 ) . </S>",
    "<S> though the exact calculation of @xmath32 and @xmath33 is difficult , a numerical mean - field calculation suggests that both phases may occur for different combinations of these parameters .    to the end of this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will focus on the situation where the ratio between @xmath32 and @xmath33 is such that the favored ground state is the coexisting phase . </S>",
    "<S> the superposition of the non - coplanar spin - spirals form then a triangular skyrmion - lattice on the surface @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the components of the magnetization form a periodic structure with a triangular symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> each unit cell of the triangular lattice holds a skyrmion with a unit pontryagin - number @xcite , @xmath36 , and a zero net magnetization . in the core of each skyrmion the magnetization points in the direction normal to the surface and it rotates continuously towards the opposite direction at the edges of the unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> an illustration of the magnetization direction in a unit cell appears in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig4 ] ) . clearly , the system chooses spontaneously one of the two time - reversal - breaking states which are characterized by opposite pontryagin - number , @xmath36 .    </S>",
    "<S> in the @xmath37 quantum hall state @xcite , the skyrmion - lattice phase breaks both the translation and the @xmath38 symmetry of the single - skyrmion state . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the quantum hall case , in this case there is no rotational symmetry and therefore we expect that the only massless goldstone modes will be the standard phonons of a two dimensional triangular lattice .    motivated by the rpa results </S>",
    "<S> , we now discuss the mean - field ( mf ) theory of the skyrmion - lattice phase . </S>",
    "<S> this mean - field treatment will allow us a better understanding of the skyrmion - lattice phase and its topological features . </S>",
    "<S> we consider eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : fu_h ] ) as the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume a non - vanishing expectation value of the magnetization : @xmath39 where @xmath40 describes the skyrmion - lattice that we found in the rpa , and @xmath41 are the nesting vectors of the fermi - surface in the hexagonal region . in the mean - field approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the interaction part of the hamiltonian becomes : @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the fourier components of @xmath44 and @xmath25 is the interaction strength of a contact interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the full mean - field hamiltonian , including the kinetic part eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : fu_h ] ) , can be solved now by using bloch theorem , to yield a band structure . to the end of this paper , </S>",
    "<S> we restrict the fermi - energy to be at the hexagonal range and we assume that the magnetization energy is much smaller than that scale . </S>",
    "<S> the two continuum branches of the dirac - cone split into a periodic band structure fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig5](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> we define the ground - state mf energy : @xmath45 where the summation of @xmath46 is over the first brillouin zone and the summation of @xmath47 is over the occupied bands . by minimizing eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : m_f_e ] ) with respect to the magnetization , we find that a critical interaction exists , above which there is a non - trivial minimum to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : m_f_e ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this critical interaction as a function of the fermi - energy appears in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that the mf values of the critical interaction agree quite well with the rpa results . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the phase transition to the gapped phase to be a second order phase transition where the gap grows as @xmath48 . as shown in @xcite , in the known topological insulators such as bi@xmath49te@xmath50 and bi@xmath49se@xmath50 , these values of critical interaction strength are too strong for an instability , albeit not by a large factor , making the instability an issue that may be relevant for other topological insulators .    </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the surface splits into many bands which , in general , cross each other . </S>",
    "<S> however , we found that the two bands near the dirac - point cross each other only at the dirac - point and are gapped from all the other bands . </S>",
    "<S> the two bands near the dirac - point for representative values of the parameters are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig5](b ) ) . clearly , </S>",
    "<S> while near the dirac - point the original branches of the dirac - cone are almost unchanged , at the fermi - energy the change is dramatic . </S>",
    "<S> a gap is opened at the fermi - energy and the surface spectrum becomes fully gapped . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the surface spectrum is not symmetric with respect to the dirac point , since the magnetization has a non - zero pontryagin - number ( winding ) which differentiates between states with different chirality .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to explore the topological properties of the surface . in the absence of interactions , </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the surface is gapless . by adding a mass term , which is equivalent to a uniform magnetization </S>",
    "<S> , a gap is opened at the dirac - point and a half - integer hall conductivity arises @xcite . for an infinite dirac - cone </S>",
    "<S> , this half - integer hall conductivity is precisely quantized . </S>",
    "<S> however , in real systems the dirac bands have an energy cutoff and therefore the half - integer hall conductivity is not precisely quantized . </S>",
    "<S> it deviates from the half - integer value by an amount which scales as the gap energy divided by the cutoff energy . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the gap at the dirac - point can be opened due to interactions or by applying an external magnetic field . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the gap that is opened is rather small ( @xmath51 ) which makes the observation of the half - integer hall conductivity a hard task , since experimentally , it is required to fine tune the fermi - energy to the narrow gap .    </S>",
    "<S> as opposed to this narrow gap , the hexagonal range is covering a wide energy window , both in the upper and in the lower branch . in the well known topological insulators </S>",
    "<S> this energy window , @xmath52 , is of the order of @xmath53 . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig3 ] ) , by tuning the fermi - energy to any value in the hexagonal range and for a strong enough interaction , a gap is opened at the fermi - energy and a quantum hall effect may be observed .    </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the skyrmion - lattice phase is always gapped at the fermi - energy and the lattice symmetry of this phase yields a brillouin zone and a wave - function of the form of a bloch wave - function . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to define a chern - number associated with each band : @xmath54)\\ ] ] where , @xmath55 is the projector to the @xmath56 band . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the two bands near the dirac - point as @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath57 is the lower band and @xmath58 is the upper band ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig5 ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> of course , there are many more bands above and below these two , both surface and bulk bands . however , the @xmath59 bands are gapped from all other bands and we will treat them as an isolated band inside the bulk gap . </S>",
    "<S> using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : chern ] ) , we find that when the fermi - energy is at the hexagonal range the chern - number of this band is @xmath60 ( see supplementary ) . </S>",
    "<S> this chern - number of the combined band is independent of the existence of a mass term that introduces an energy gap between them . in the presence of a mass term these two bands </S>",
    "<S> are separated and their total chern - number is unchanged .    </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to examine how transport on the surface of a thick slab depends on the fermi - energy when electron - electron interaction is strong enough for spontaneous magnetization to occur . </S>",
    "<S> when the fermi - energy is tuned to the hexagonal range in the lower branch , a gap is opened beneath the @xmath57 band and the occupied bands below the fermi energy contribute a chern - number @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath62 signs refer to the two possible time - reversal - breaking states . in general </S>",
    "<S> , the contributions to this @xmath47 come from the three dimensional bands within the bulk of the slab and the occupied bands on its surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the breaking of time - reversal - symmetry is limited to the surface , the bulk bands do not contribute . </S>",
    "<S> as the fermi - energy is increased , the chern - number does not change as long as the system is within the skyrmion phase , since the energy gap does not close . once the fermi - energy reaches the region where the magnetization becomes uniform , the gap shifts away from the fermi - energy to the dirac point , and the hall conductivity ceases to be quantized . </S>",
    "<S> it becomes quantized again when the fermi - energy is at the dirac point , in an energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> then , the hall conductivity of the entire slab is quantized to an integer , and that of each surface is approximately quantized to a half - integer . </S>",
    "<S> finally , when the fermi - energy is increased further , it passes through a gapless region in the circular range and gets to the hexagonal range on the positive side of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> again , the system chooses spontaneously between the two time - reversal - breaking states and the occupied bands will contribute a chern - number of @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the particular value of @xmath47 is not universal , and would depend on details of the band structure . </S>",
    "<S> we can , however , generally say that the difference in hall conductivity between the fermi - energy lying in the lower and upper hexagonal ranges is an odd integer . </S>",
    "<S> these two cases are illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig8 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis above points out to two types of situations where the hall conductivity on a surface may vary in space . </S>",
    "<S> first , that may happen when time - reversal is broken in opposite ways in different regions . and second , that may happen when the fermi - energy varies in space , due to a variation between local density of electrons . in both cases , the domain walls must carry one - dimensional chiral edge channels . </S>",
    "<S> notably , these chiral edge modes occur without an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> such one - dimensional edge channels on the surface of topological insulators may arise as a consequence of a magnetic field , as discussed in @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we point out that in the presence of strong enough interactions , they may appear without an external field and without the need to fine tune the fermi - energy . </S>",
    "<S> an illustration of this scenario is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig6],[fig7 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point is a topological insulator where the fermi - energy of all the surfaces is tuned to the hexagonal range at the lower branch . by tuning the fermi - energy of selected surfaces to the hexagonal range at the upper branch , one - dimensional edge channels will appear . </S>",
    "<S> this tuning may be done by an external voltage .    to summarize , we considered here the possibility that a non - uniform magnetization spontaneously appears on the surface of a three dimensional strong topological insulator due to interactions between surface electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we assumed that the fermi - energy is such that the fermi - surface arising from a @xmath64 effective dirac hamiltonian is strongly nested . </S>",
    "<S> we treated interactions within the mean - field and the random phase approximations . </S>",
    "<S> we found that for a strong enough interaction the surface may be unstable to the formation of a skyrmion - lattice phase which is a result of a multiple sdw states . </S>",
    "<S> we found the transition from the unmagnetized to skyrmion - lattice phase to be of second order as a function of interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that as long as the fermi - energy is located at the hexagonal range , the dependence of the critical interaction strength on fermi - energy is rather mild while the temperature dependence is rather strong . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that even in the absence of an external magnetic field a non - trivial chern - number arises from the mean - field bloch wave function of the surface in the skyrmion - lattice phase and that this chern - number can be controlled by tuning the fermi - energy . using this feature </S>",
    "<S> , we suggested that a network of one - dimensional chiral channels can be established on the surfaces of a strong topological insulator with a strong enough electron - electron interaction .    </S>",
