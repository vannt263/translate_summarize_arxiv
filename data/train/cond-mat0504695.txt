    "the reaction dynamics of particles that undergo pairwise mutual annihilation is of interest to various fields of physics , including diffusion controlled reactions @xcite , and exciton annihilation in molecular crystals @xcite . in these examples",
    "the particles are free to move or diffuse throughout the system , and when two complementary particles collide , they annihilate .",
    "this kind of dynamics can be modeled by adopting a network approach in which the particles , rather than moving across the system , are placed at the vertices of a given network .",
    "the edges of the network would represent direct interactions between the particles at a given time , or interactions that might occur during time as the particles diffuse throughout the system .",
    "this approach has proven to be useful in understanding the collective dynamical behavior in many - particle systems @xcite . in some other cases ,",
    "the annihilating particles can be accurately represented as being fixed on a lattice . as an example , consider the pycnonuclear reactions taking place in the interior of dense stars @xcite . in this case , the atom nuclei undergoing mutual annihilation become frozen into a regular crystalline lattice structure due to the high densities of the cores .",
    "other examples are the irreversible sequential adsorption and `` car parking '' analogues , where the system reaches a jammed state in which the lattice or space can not be filled completely @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the static pairwise annihilation problem on complex networks , generalizing previous results obtained for ordered lattices @xcite . as such , the annihilation problem on complex networks is interesting in its own right since it provides a dynamical probe of the topological properties of the structure on which it occurs .",
    "these properties will be different than , and complementary to , those associated with other physical processes in complex networks , such as random walks @xcite , ising spin dynamics @xcite , target annihilation @xcite , majority voter models and neural network dynamics @xcite , epidemic spreading @xcite , trapping @xcite , etc .",
    "it is precisely these complementary features which lead us to consider static annihilation as a probe of different complex networks , such as ordered lattices , erds - rnyi random networks ( also called poisson networks ) , scale - free networks and small - world networks .",
    "small - world networks are particularly interesting , since they can be considered as a class of networks lying at some intermediate point between ordered lattices and fully random networks .",
    "they possess a large degree of local clustering , but a relatively small minimal path length connecting nodes throughout the system . on the other hand ,",
    "scale - free networks are characterized by the presence of `` hubs '' or elements with an extremely high connectivity .",
    "these hubs hold the network together and produce a very small minimal path length .",
    "complex networks are currently under intense investigation as useful structures on which to model a variety of network related phenomena , including electrical power grids , the internet , human social relationships , proteomic and genetic interactions , to mention just a few examples @xcite .",
    "we are interested here in exploring the effects that arise on the static annihilation process from the different features associated with the different network topologies mentioned above .",
    "[ fig : ring ] several exact results have previously been obtained for the static annihilation problem on ordered lattices .",
    "kenkre and van horn , e.g. , considered a 1d ordered ring of @xmath0 sites , in which each site is initially occupied by a particle , as in fig .  [ fig : ring]a . at the onset of the annihilation process ,",
    "neighboring particles on the ring begin to undergo mutual annihilation with rate constant @xmath1 .",
    "as pairs of particles disappear from the ring , the possibility arises for particles at certain sites to become isolated .",
    "such particles end up surviving indefinitely , with no neighbors left on either side to annihilate with ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ring]b ) . for this model",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite were able to calculate exactly the average fraction @xmath2 of sites on the ring that remain populated at time @xmath3 .",
    "for an infinite 1d ring they found @xmath4 from which the exact stationary survival fraction @xmath5 follows .",
    "a dynamical mean - field theory for higher dimensional ordered structures was later given by kenkre @xcite .",
    "in that work , the long - time survival fraction on a square lattice in @xmath6 dimensions was found to decrease as the dimensionality @xmath6 ( and the number of potential annihilation partners ) increases , specifically , via @xmath7    of course , on a translationally invariant structure the connectivity of any site on the lattice is the same as that of any other .",
    "each site , moreover , has _ a priori _ the same probability of ultimately surviving the annihilation onslaught .",
    "it is interesting , therefore , to see what effects are generated in the annihilation dynamics by _ dispersion _ in the local site coordination number . in a sense , poisson ,",
    "scale - free and small - world networks are ideal structures on which to explore these questions .",
    "such structures allow , through a simple variation of the network parameters , significant changes in the average coordination number as well as a means to systematically change the associated dispersion in local coordination .",
    "this is especially true for scale - free networks , where the dispersion in the local coordination number can become infinite .    in the present paper",
    "we generalize the results of @xcite to a variety of complex networks that allow us to explore these connectivity - related issues .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : mean - field ] we present a mean - field theory of the annihilation process on disordered networks with arbitrary connectivity distributions .",
    "we then apply the general formalism to three specific cases : ( a ) random networks in which every element has exactly @xmath8 connections ( kronecker networks ) ; ( b ) erds - rnyi ( i.e. poisson ) networks with average connectivity @xmath8 ; and ( c ) scale - free networks .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the mean - field approach requires the statistical independence of the network elements .",
    "thus , our formalism applies neither to ordered lattices nor to small - world networks , where loops of connected sites are commonly found .",
    "such loops generate non - trivial correlations between the elements which are not taken into account in the mean - field approach .",
    "however , case ( a ) above can be considered as an approximation to ordered lattices with coordination number @xmath8 .",
    "the approximation becomes exact in the limit @xmath9 .",
    "additionally , as we show through numerical simulation in section  [ sec : small - world ] , the mean - field approach qualitatively describes the annihilation dynamics in ordered and small - world structures .",
    "we end this work in section  [ sec : conclusions ] with a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "in this section we develop a simple mean - field theory of particle annihilation in networks with an arbitrary connectivity distribution @xmath10 .",
    "this theory is exact as long as the connecting sites of each element in the network are randomly chosen from anywhere in the system .",
    "in such a case , the correlations that arise due to the occurrence of loops of connected sites can be neglected .",
    "the above is not true in general either for small - world networks or for ordered lattices .",
    "however , the mean - field approach presented here will allow us to gain insight into the effects that the overall connectivity of the system has on the annihilation dynamics .",
    "as we will see , since the infinite 1d ordered lattice with nearest - neighbor connections is loopless , our predictions recover the exact solution for this structure .",
    "we are interested in evaluating the fraction of surviving sites @xmath2 at time @xmath3 in a network in which dimers ( i.e. pairs of connected sites ) have been removed randomly .",
    "we assume that the network is initially full , and that the probability that a site has @xmath11 connections is given by @xmath10 .",
    "we denote by @xmath12 the fraction of surviving sites that are connected to @xmath11 surviving sites at time @xmath3",
    ". we will refer to these as @xmath11-sites .",
    "it is clear that @xmath13 .",
    "next , we determine the time evolution of these densities by considering the three different ways in which @xmath12 can change :    1 .   as we remove dimers , a @xmath11-site can become a @xmath14-site if one of its connecting sites is removed . to determine the rate",
    "at which this happens we focus on one of the @xmath11 connections of the @xmath11-site ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : network]b ) .",
    "the probability that this connection goes to an @xmath15-site is proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "stands for the fact that it is more probable to be connected to sites with a large number of connections than to sites with a small number of connections .",
    "] we have to normalize this probability by dividing between @xmath17 since the fractions @xmath18 change in time and they do not add up to 1 ( except at @xmath19 ) .",
    "therefore , the chosen connecting site in fig .",
    "[ fig : network]b will be an @xmath15-site with probability @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath15-site will be removed if the dimer formed by this site and any of the other @xmath21 sites to which it is connected ( not considering the @xmath11-site we started from ) is removed .",
    "adding over all @xmath15 and considering the @xmath11 connections of the @xmath11-site , the total rate at which @xmath11-sites become @xmath14-sites is @xmath22 2 .",
    "a @xmath23-site can become a @xmath11-site .",
    "for the same reasons as before , this happens with probability @xmath24 3 .",
    "finally , @xmath11-sites may also be removed if any of the @xmath11 different dimers to which they belong is chosen for removal , which occurs with probability @xmath25 .",
    "adding the three quantities above ( with the correct sign ) we find that the densities @xmath12 satisfy the following set of evolution equations :    @xmath26\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{m=0}^\\infty m(m-1 ) f(m , t ) } { \\sum\\limits_{m=0}^\\infty m f(m , t ) } - k f(k , t ) .",

    "it is also important to note that @xmath36 must be determined through the consistency equation ( [ eq : consistency - g ] ) .",
    "it is clear that at the end of the annihilation process , only isolated elements with @xmath37 will survive .",
    "therefore , the fractions @xmath12 should fulfill the condition @xmath38 the fraction @xmath39 of surviving elements at the end of the annihilation process is then given by @xmath40 in what follows we apply the general formalism presented in this section to obtain @xmath39 for networks with different topologies .",
    "we now apply the preceding formalism to the specific case in which every site of the initial network has exactly @xmath8 connections .",

    "as our mean - field formalism shows , a highly - connected site is very likely to annihilate quickly with one of its many partners , leaving the remaining sites to which it was connected more isolated than they would have been if they had been part of an ordered network .",
    "hence , it appears that dispersion in the local connectivity leads to enhanced survivability in the annihilation problem .",
    "in this work he have analyzed the static annihilation process on complex networks . in this problem ,",
    "pairs of connected particles annihilate at a constant rate . through a mean - field approach",
    "we were able to compute exact general expressions for the fraction of surviving particles with @xmath11 connections at time @xmath3 for random networks with arbitrary connectivity distribution @xmath10 .",
    "our results indicate that kronecker and poisson networks exhibit a similar behavior in that the final fraction of surviving particles @xmath39 asymptotically behaves as @xmath146 for large values of @xmath8 , the average connectivity of the initial network .",
    "numerical simulations show that this is also true for ordered lattices and small - world networks .",
    "so , although the mean - field approach is not exactly applicable to ordered latices and small - world networks , it predicts qualitatively the correct asymptotic limit @xmath144 for such systems .",
    "the situation is radically different in scale - free networks , characterized by the connectivity distribution @xmath147 . for this kind of network ,",
    "our theory predicts that @xmath148 for @xmath119 and that @xmath149 .",
    "thus , in the range @xmath119 in which the average network connectivity @xmath8 diverges , all the particles ( or almost all in finite systems ) survive the annihilation process .",
    "the above result is a consequence of the fact that highly connected sites annihilate faster than poorly connected ones .",
    "while this happens in every network , it has dramatic consequences in scale - free structures in which , once the hubs are annihilated , the network breaks apart and only isolated sites are left .",
    "this kind of behavior is reminiscent of the breakdown of scale - free networks when the highly connected sites are deliberately attacked @xcite .",
    "here we have shown that the annihilation of the hubs does not only break the network apart , but that it pulverizes the network .",
    "diffusion annihilation dynamics of the kind @xmath150 has recently been studied on complex networks using an analogous formalism as the one presented in this work @xcite . in diffusion annihilation ,",
    "the particles , rather than being fixed to the vertices , are free to move ( diffuse ) throughout the network .",
    "two particles annihilate if they collide at some vertex of the network for the first time .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite show that the fraction of surviving particles decreases in time as @xmath151 for poisson - like networks and as @xmath152 for scale - free networks , where @xmath153 depends on the scale - free exponent .",
    "obviously , contrary to what happens in the static case considered in this work , there are no surviving particles in diffusion annihilation .",
    "thus , our results describe situations that are , in some sense , complementary to those analyzed by ref .  @xcite .",
