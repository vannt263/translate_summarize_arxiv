    "the mechanical strength of real materials is usually controlled by the occurrence of grain boundaries , cracks , dislocations and other micro - structural defects .",
    "if such defects were not present , the strength would be limited by the stress at which the lattice itself becomes unstable with respect to a homogeneous strain .",
    "this stress referred to as the ideal strength or ideal tensile strength ( its ) is an upper bound strength of an ideal single crystal .",
    "the ideal strength is an inherent property of a defect - free material and can offer insight into the correlation between the intrinsic chemical bonding and the crystal symmetry , and has been accepted as an essential mechanical parameter of single crystal materials  @xcite .",

    "@xcite among the body - centered cubic ( bcc ) metals , fe received a great scientific interest .  @xcite it was reported that , the @xmath1 $ ] direction of fe is the weakest direction in response to an uniaxial stress .",
    "it has been shown , that a bifurcation from the primary tetragonal deformation path ( the bain path ) to a secondary orthorhombic deformation path occurs after the its on the primary path is reached .",

    "@xcite computed the ideal strength of fe in the [ 001 ] direction considering the fm order , a collinear anti - ferromagnetic structure ( afm , magnetic moment sequence @xmath37 ) and a collinear double layer anti - ferromagnetic structure ( dafm , magnetic moment sequence @xmath38 ) .",
    "their results show that fe remains fm up to the point of its elastic instability during uniaxial tension , which lies at approximately @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 denotes the experimental atomic volume of bcc fe ) .",

    "according to both references , fm order is the predominant magnetic order in the configuration space for @xmath43 and @xmath44 . both references hence indicate that the point of elastic instability of fe reported by clatterbuck _",

    "[ fig : fitting ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : alloysstress ] , it is immediately evident that the ideal strength of fe is most significantly affected by the fixed volume constraint , i.e. , it increases from @xmath2 gpa to @xmath46 gpa .",
    "this is unlike the fe - alloys with moderate solute concentrations , where the ideal strength increases are considerably smaller the higher the solute concentration are , e.g. , we obtained an increase from @xmath47 gpa to @xmath48 gpa for fe-@xmath49v .",
    "an answer to the observed correlation may be given by considering magnetism in fe and its alloys . in the following we chose fe-@xmath49v as a representative of all investigated binary alloys .",
    "the total energy and the spin magnetic moment of fe are opposed to those of fe-@xmath49v in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , where we plotted both quantities as a function of the tetragonal axial ratio ( @xmath50 ) and the wigner - seitz radius , @xmath51 .",
    "we also displayed the corresponding uniaxial deformation path in the range from @xmath52 .",
    "as visible from the contour plots , the magnetic moment increase of fe along the deformation allowing for a volume change from @xmath52 is much stronger than the one of fe-@xmath49v ; the numbers read @xmath53 and @xmath54 for fe and the fe-@xmath49v alloy , respectively .",
    "these numbers are in contrast to the deformation at constant volume ( in the range @xmath55 ) , where the changes are @xmath56 @xmath33 for fe and @xmath57 @xmath33 for fe-@xmath49v .",
    "that indicates that the increase of the atomic volume has a more pronounced influence on the relaxation of the magnetic moment than the structural change ( @xmath50 ) , a result which can be clearly associated with the contour lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath58 is at most 1.5% ( for one and the same material ) , i.e. , @xmath59 is quite similar to @xmath35 for fe and the present fe - alloys .",
    "now , alloying fe with any of the solutes under investigation in this work increases the equilibrium volume ( table  [ table : alloyslattice ] ) .",
    "unconstrained uniaxial tensile loading is also accompanied by an increase of the volume per atom , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : volume ] for fe and for the fe - based alloys with the highest considered solute concentrations . in the region of the maximum strains , both fe and the fe alloys have rather similar volumes as opposed to the situation at equilibrium .",
    "the volume change of fe due to the deformation is thus distinctly larger than those of the fe - based alloys . according to our numerical data ( also fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) , the larger volume increase of fe is paralleled by a larger magnetic moment increase along the uniaxial deformation from equilibrium to @xmath35 , despite the fact that fe contributes only by a factor of @xmath60 to the magnetic moment of the alloys .",
    "the comparatively large increase of the magnetic moment in fe along the uniaxial deformation path with unconstrained volume and the pronounced difference between @xmath61 and @xmath15 ( 5 gpa ) may , at least in parts , be related .",
    "we recall , that both the increase of the magnetic moment and the difference @xmath62 of all fe - alloys are smaller than the values of fe . to substantiate this correlation",
    ", we recalculated the itss for the previously determined unconstrained strain paths but with fixed magnetic moments , i.e. , the magnetic moments were not allowed to relax to self - consistency .",
    "we employed the respective ground state magnetic moments of fe and the fe - v alloys .    fixing the magnetic moment increases the resulting computed strengths , but",
    "the increase is strongly diminished with higher solute concentration , e.g. , approximately @xmath63 gpa for fe but only @xmath64 gpa for fe-10v .",
    "the previous numbers may be obtained by comparing @xmath15 from fig .",
    "[ fig : alloysstress ] with the itss obtained with the fixed - spin moment constraint depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fitting ] ( open pentagons ) .",
    "the latter strength values are plotted in comparison to the previously determined itss computed without a constraint on the magnetic moments but for fixed volume ( @xmath61 ) . the alloying trend that both curves for fe - v follow in fig .",
    "[ fig : fitting ] is alike , and the resulting stresses are essentially much larger than @xmath15 of fe ( @xmath63 gpa for the fixed - spin moment value and @xmath65 gpa for @xmath61 ) but only slightly to moderately larger than @xmath15 of fe-10v ( @xmath64 gpa for the fixed - spin moment value and @xmath66 gpa for @xmath61 ) .",
    "thus , fixing the volume but allowing for a relaxation of the magnetic moments produces essentially the same alloying effect than fixing the magnetic moment but taking into account structural relaxations .",
    "however , as we pointed out above , the magnetic moment is almost unchanged along the constant volume deformation owing to the weak influence of the @xmath50 ratio .",
    "thus , we conclude , that the main contribution to the difference of @xmath67 and @xmath15 originates from a magnetic contribution to the total energies which is associated with the relaxation of the spin magnetic moment to its self - consistent value .",
    "this magnetic contribution is accordingly the largest for fe , which can be partly ascribed to the comparatively small volume at equilibrium .",
    "both the reduced volume change and the involved reduced magnetic contribution to the stress bring forth the convergence of @xmath61 to @xmath68 for the investigated fe - alloys with 10% solute concentration .    returning in conclusion to eq .",
    ", the correlation between @xmath68 and @xmath69 fails due to magnetism in fe and the investigated fe alloys .",
    "that is , the alloying trend on the fcc - bcc seds at fixed volume can not capture the alloying trend on the energy - strain landscape and hence the its of the uniaxial deformation path as opposed to nonmagnetic v - ti - cr alloys .",
    "the ideal tensile strengths of bcc ferromagnetic fe and fe@xmath0 ( _ _ m__=cr , ni , al , co , mn , and v ) random alloys in the @xmath1 $ ] direction have been investigated using the all - electron exact muffin - tin orbitals method in combination with the coherent - potential approximation . the present calculated ideal strength value of fe and the branching point from the primary bct deformation path to the secondary orthorhombic deformation path of fe agree well with previously published results , which thus confirms that our methodology has the accuracy needed for such kind of calculations .",
    "for the fe - based alloys , we found that the ideal strength increases with increasing concentration of cr , co , and v and decreases with ni and al addition into pure fe .",
    "mn shows a non - monotonous alloying behavior . unlike the nonmagnetic bcc v - based alloys investigated in our previous paper ,  @xcite constant volume fcc - bcc structural energy differences",
    "can not entirely capture the alloying effect on the ideal tensile strength for the fm bcc fe - based alloys . by calculating auxiliary ideal strengths assuming a constant volume deformation ( @xmath61 ) and fixed - spin moment calculations along the ( kept unaltered ) tetragonal deformation paths",
    ", we showed that mainly the interplay between the volume increase and magnetic moment increase along the tetragonal deformation paths lead to a failure of the correlation between @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the present results offer a consistent starting point for further theoretical modeling of the micro - mechanical properties of fe - based alloys .",
    "based on these achievements , we conclude that the emto - cpa approach provides an efficient and accurate theoretical tool to design the mechanical strength of ferromagnetic bcc random solid solutions nevertheless , in such applications one should always monitor the basic muffin - tin and single - site cpa errors and make sure that they remain at acceptable level as a function of the lattice distortion and chemical composition .",
