    "<S> magnetoresistance ( mr ) of the bi@xmath0pb@xmath1sr@xmath2co@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath4=0 , 0.3 , 0.4 ) single crystals is investigated systematically . a nonmonotonic variation of the isothermal in - plane and out - of - plane mr with the field is observed . </S>",
    "<S> the out - of - plane mr is positive in high temperatures and increases with decreasing @xmath5 , and exhibits a pronounced hump , and changes the sign from positive to negative at a centain temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these results strongly suggest that the observed mr consists of two contributions : one _ negative _ and one _ positive _ component . </S>",
    "<S> the isothermal mr in high magnetic fields follows a @xmath6 law . while the negative contribution comes from spin scattering of carriers by localized - magnetic - moments based on the khosla - fischer model . </S>"
