    "the milky way is a gravitationally bound system of a few @xmath2 stars , but it also hosts some unbound stars . where these unbound stars come from is an open question .",
    "it is very difficult to explain unbound main - sequence stars by supernova explosions in close binary systems @xcite or by dynamical encounters between binaries @xcite , the mechanisms that explain disk `` runaway '' stars .",
    "simulations show that stars can not be launched at speeds greater than their binary orbital velocity , and this velocity can not exceed the escape velocity from a star s surface , since that would require the stars to be orbiting inside one another @xcite .",
    "the escape velocity from the surface of main - sequence stars is comparable to the 500  600  local galactic escape velocity @xcite . only dynamical interactions with an object more massive and compact than a star",
    "can easily explain unbound main - sequence stars .",
    "@xcite predicted that three - body exchange interactions between stars and the central massive black hole ( mbh ) will inevitably unbind stars from the galaxy , and he called such objects `` hypervelocity stars '' ( hvss ) .",
    "we therefore refer to unbound main - sequence stars in this paper as hvss .",
    "the first hvs was discovered by @xcite , and a couple dozen b - type hvss are now known in the milky way halo @xcite .",
    "these stars have radial velocities up to @xmath3 ; no star moving towards us with a comparable radial velocity has ever been observed . to date , detailed spectroscopic analyses of the b - type hvss find that they are main - sequence b stars at 10  100 kpc distances @xcite .",
    "the short lifetimes of b stars require that these unbound stars were ejected from a region with recent star formation , such as the galactic disk or the galactic center .",
    "full three - dimensional trajectories for the hvss are a crucial test of their origin .",
    "measuring the trajectories for the hvss , however , requires accurate distances and absolute proper motions .",
    "distance estimates to individual stars are determined by comparing either spectroscopic @xmath4  and @xmath5  or broadband colors to stellar evolution tracks .",
    "typical precision is 15% @xcite ; the accuracy depends on the choice of stellar evolution tracks ( i.e.  assumptions about metallicity ) .",
    "proper motions are equally difficult to measure , because hvss are distant and they should be on radial trajectories .",
    "expected hvs proper motions are typically @xmath6 mas yr@xmath7  and thus can not be measured with ground based surveys .",
    "the only unbound star with a statistically significant proper motion measurement to date is the runaway b star , a star that was ejected in the direction of galactic rotation from the outer disk @xcite .",
    "is another example of a high velocity b star with a significant proper motion measurement , but it is unbound at less than @xmath8 significance @xcite . here , we present _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ proper motion measurements for a sample of 16 stars with extreme radial velocities , 12 of which are unbound to the milky way in radial velocity alone .",
    "proper motions are important because they can discriminate between galactic center and galactic disk origins .",
    "the star ( hereafter ) , for example , is a helium - rich sdo star with a + 708  heliocentric radial velocity @xcite .",
    "sdo stars are the remnants of low mass stars ; helium rich sdo stars are possibly the merger product of two helium white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "if were ejected by the central mbh , its velocity vector will point away from the galactic center .",
    "if were ejected by a type ia supernova explosion @xcite , its velocity vector can point from anywhere in the milky way .    generally speaking , lower velocity stars are more likely to be disk runaways .",
    "the maximum ejection velocity in the @xcite supernova mechanism is the sum of the supernova kick velocity and the orbital velocity of the progenitor binary , or about 250  for an ejected main - sequence b star @xcite .",
    "velocities up to 500  may be possible for b stars ejected by extremely asymmetric core - collapse supernovae in contact binaries @xcite .",
    "the maximum ejection velocity in the dynamical mechanism depends on the most massive star in the encounter , and can also reach 500  in extreme scenarios @xcite .",
    "simulations suggest that 99% of dynamical ejections occur at velocities @xmath9200  @xcite .",
    "we test for the existence of @xmath1500  runaway ejections by including four bound velocity outliers in our sample .",
    "the star he 04375439 ( hereafter ) , an unbound 9 @xmath10   main - sequence b star located 16 deg from the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , presents another puzzle @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of this star is many times shorter than its flight time from the milky way , suggesting an lmc origin .",
    "an lmc origin requires a 1,000  ejection , however , and thus an unseen mbh in the lmc @xcite . a milky way origin",
    ", on the other hand , requires that be a blue straggler to account for its lifetime .",
    "in other words , the progenitor must have been a binary system ejected at  that subsequently merged as it traveled away from the milky way .",
    "a binary mbh could eject stellar binaries as hvss @xcite , or else a single mbh could eject binaries by triple disruption @xcite .",
    "all of these models have very low ejection rates .",
    "the lmc and galactic center origins for differ by 1.5 mas yr@xmath7  in proper motion . using two epochs of _ hst _ imaging",
    ", @xcite found that is moving away from the milky way .",
    "@xcite argue that both milky way and lmc origins , given the systematic uncertainties , are consistent with the measurements .",
    "a third epoch of imaging is needed .    in principle , _ hst _ proper - motion measurements have sufficient precision to determine the origin of our unbound stars . using the best data reduction and measurement techniques ,",
    "it is possible to achieve 0.01 pixel astrometric precision on well - exposed stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) wide - field channel has 50 mas pixels , and the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) ultraviolet - visible ( uvis ) channel has 40 mas pixels . for a pair of measurements separated by a 3 year time baseline , we can thus expect 0.2 mas yr@xmath7  precision .",
    "we must rely on background galaxies to define our absolute reference frame , however , and both the number and spatial distribution of useful background galaxies introduce a systematic uncertainty to the measurements . in some cases ,",
    "a sequence of short and long exposures is used to link faint background galaxies to bright hvss , adding additional uncertainty .    for the sake of clarity ,",
    "we quote proper motion uncertainties that are the sum in quadrature of the statistical ( stellar ) and systematic ( background galaxy ) proper motion uncertainties throughout this paper .",
    "our average total uncertainty is @xmath11 mas yr@xmath7 , a 6-fold improvement over existing proper motion measurements .    in section 2",
    "we define the sample of 12 unbound and four bound stars , and present new spectroscopy and stellar atmosphere fits for the four bound stars . in section 3",
    "we describe the _ hst _ imaging , image reduction , and proper motion measurements .",
    "twelve stars have proper motions statistically consistent with zero , and thus largely radial trajectories . in section 4",
    "we evaluate the constraints on a galactic center origin , accounting simultaneously for radial velocity , distance , and proper motion errors .",
    "thirteen stars have trajectories consistent with a galactic center origin given the measurement errors , while three stars are inconsistent with a galactic center origin at @xmath123@xmath0 confidence . in section 5",
    "we discuss the objects with significant proper motions , the runaway stars , b  711 , and b  733 .",
    "we also update our constraints on hvs 3 , consistent with either a lmc or milky way origin .",
    "we conclude in section 6 .",
    "we select our sample of 16 stars for their extreme radial velocities .",
    "we targeted all 12 unbound hvss known prior to 2008 march , plus four bound velocity outliers from the hvs survey of @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : hvs ] lists the coordinates and other observed properties of the stars .",
    "we refer to the 12 unbound stars as @xcite , = @xcite , he @xmath13 = @xcite , - @xcite , - @xcite , - @xcite , and - @xcite .",
    "we refer to the four bound velocity outliers as b  434 , b  485 , b  711 , and b  733 , corresponding to their target numbers in the hvs survey @xcite .",
    "detailed analyses of the unbound stars indicate that , except for , they are main - sequence b stars at 50 - 100 kpc distances . this conclusion is based on stellar atmosphere fits to high resolution echelle spectra of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and fits to moderate resolution , high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) spectra of the other hvss @xcite . here",
    "we describe spectroscopy of the four bound velocity outliers .",
    "we obtained 6.5 m mmt blue channel spectroscopy of the four bound velocity outliers in four different observing runs in 2006 february , 2008 february , 2010 march , and 2014 march .",
    "we used the 832 l mm@xmath7 grating in 2nd order with a 1 arcsec slit , providing 1.0   spectral resolution over the range 3600 - 4500  .",
    "in addition , we observed b  485 a second time with a 0.75 arcsec slit to test higher 0.75   spectral resolution .",
    "we paired every observation with a he - ne - ar comparison lamp exposure for wavelength calibration .",
    "we chose exposure times to achieve s / n=50 - 100 per resolution element in the continuum .",
    "we process and extract the 1d spectra using iraf .",
    "we measure radial velocities using the cross - correlation package rvsao @xcite .",
    "we then measure effective temperature @xmath4 , surface gravity @xmath5 , and projected rotation @xmath14  using stellar atmosphere models as described in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : spec ] compares the best - fit stellar atmosphere models to the observed spectra .",
    "all four bound velocity outliers are late b - type stars , and b  733 has significant projected rotational velocity @xmath14=@xmath15 .",
    "our sample contains 15 b - type stars plus the sdo star .",
    "figure [ fig : teff ] displays the adopted effective temperature @xmath4  and surface gravity @xmath5  for the 15 b - type stars in our sample , plotted in comparison to padova solar metallicity main - sequence tracks @xcite . does not appear because it is a @xmath4=45,560 k sdo star .",
    "the clumping of stars in figure [ fig : teff ] reflects the hvs survey target selection of stars with the colors of 3 @xmath10  main sequence stars .",
    "notably , all four stars with high resolution echelle spectroscopy are fast rotators .",
    "another five b - type stars have statistically significant @xmath14@xmath16  on the basis of our moderate resolution mmt spectroscopy .",
    "fast rotation is the unambiguous signature of a main - sequence b star . for reference ,",
    "the mean @xmath14  of late b - type stars is 150  @xcite",
    ". evolved horizontal branch stars of the same temperature and surface gravity , on the other hand , are slow rotators with @xmath14  @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "thus these b - type stars are main - sequence stars .",
    "we compare the measured stellar atmosphere parameters to padova main - sequence stellar evolution tracks to estimate luminosities @xcite . propagating the measurement uncertainties through the stellar evolution tracks",
    "implies that our luminosity estimates are precise to 30% in luminosity , or 15% in distance .",
    "the precision is relatively poor because surface gravity is our primary constraint on evolutionary status , and the luminosities of b stars increase with age .",
    "the choice of stellar evolution tracks is a source of systematic uncertainty .",
    "with the exception of and , which have solar iron abundance @xcite , the metallicity of the hvss is unconstrained .",
    "if the hvss are systematically metal - rich or metal - poor , our distance estimates could be systematically wrong by @xmath125% ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "given that the hvss are relatively short - lived main - sequence b stars , however , we consider solar metallicity a reasonable assumption .",
    "we calculate heliocentric distance using the de - reddened @xmath18-band point spread function apparent magnitudes from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 10 ( dr10 ) @xcite , except for which has a @xmath19-band measurement @xcite .",
    "the sdss magnitudes have a typical precision of 2% ; however in some cases the dr10 @xmath18-band magnitude differs from previous sdss data release values by as much as 10% .",
    "the sdss photometry is thus an additional source of uncertainty , but a small fraction of the total error budget .",
    "table [ tab : hvs ] summarizes the measured and derived properties for the 16 stars .",
    "we adopt parameters from published echelle spectra when available ; otherwise we adopt parameters derived from our mmt spectra .",
    "the stellar atmosphere parameters for the four bound velocity outliers are new .",

    ", the finite number of intermediate brightness stars limits the accuracy of this approach .",
    "we obtained a second epoch of observations with wfc3 in 2012 - 2013 ( proposal i d 12662 ) in the same way .",
    "the time baseline of the observations is 3.0 yrs for these 12 stars .",
    "we made an effort to use the same telescope orientation across all epochs of imaging in order to minimize the impact of changes in charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) and errors in the distortion solution .",
    "the effects of cte increase with time as on - orbit radiation damage creates more and more charge traps in the ccd silicon lattice .",
    "the result is that star and galaxy images are trailed along the ccd read - out direction .",
    "if we observe in the same orientation in all epochs , the cte systematic is in the same direction and we minimize its impact on our differential position measurements .",
    "unfortunately , we were unable to use the same guide stars for , , and in all epochs due to changes in the _ hst _ guide star catalog .",
    "this issue forced a change in orientation , which exacerbates the astrometric effects of cte .",
    "table [ tab : obs ] lists the position angle ( p.a . ) , defined as increasing east of due north , for each observation .",
    "we begin our data reduction procedure by downloading flat - fielded images from the mikulski archive for space telescopes .",
    "because the cte correction for wfc3/uvis images and acs subarrays is not integrated into the standard pipeline , we run the @xcite pixel - based correction by hand .",
    "the cte correction is calibrated on hot pixels and their charge trails , and is successful at removing the trails behind stars , cosmic rays , and hot pixels , and restoring the flux to the stellar images .",
    "we start our analysis with the first - epoch images .",
    "we use empirical models of the acs and wfc3/uvis point spread functions ( psfs ) to measure positions for stars in the cte - corrected frames of each first epoch exposure .",
    "we then correct the positions for geometric distortion using the model in @xcite for acs and the model in @xcite for wfc3/uvis .",
    "finally , we cross identify the stars and define a linear transformation from the distortion - corrected positions of each star in each exposure into the distortion - corrected frame of the first exposure .",
    "since all of the first - epoch images were taken in a single orbit , we can safely use the stars to define the transformations .",
    "this can not be done for the later epochs , since the stars are all moving , and we need to know the motion of each target star in an inertial frame .",
    "therefore , we use the background galaxies to define the transformation from each exposure into the reference frame .",
    "although all stars can be fit with the same psf , each galaxy has its own unique distribution of light and must be measured with its own template .",
    "an additional complication is that some images were taken at different orientations or with different instruments , such that the psf for a given object might be different from epoch to epoch , affecting the observed distribution of light .",
    "for this reason , we construct templates for each galaxy with a deconvolved model , such that when we fit the template to the pixels in an image , we first convolve it with the psf appropriate for that location in that detector .",
    "this approach ensures that the stars ( which are simply delta functions when deconvolved ) and galaxies are measured consistently within an exposure .",
    "we construct the star and galaxy templates from the exposures in the first - epoch data set .",
    "the transformations ( based on the stars ) enable us to accurately map the pixels of all exposures into the reference frame . for each source , we collect all the pixels that map to within the @xmath231 region about each source ( galaxies and stars ) .",
    "we then use iterative forward modeling to construct a deconvolved template for each source .",
    "the template for the stars is simply a delta function .",
    "the template for the galaxies is a smooth empirical image that , when convolved with the psf , best described the distribution of light in the contributing exposures .",
    "we allowed the galaxies to have an additional point source at their centers , but most did not need one .",
    "we then use these templates , convolved with the appropriate psf , to measure consistent positions for every source in every exposure in each epoch .",
    "we examine the fitting residuals for each source and reject the measurements that were clearly contaminated by cosmic rays or unidentified warm pixels .",
    "measured positions are in the raw frame and must be corrected for geometric distortion , as mentioned above .",
    "next , we use the positions for the galaxies to define the linear transformation from the distortion - corrected frame of each exposure into that of the first exposure of the first epoch .",
    "we examine the transformation residuals for each galaxy and reject those galaxies with unreliable and inconsistent positions .",
    "this leaves us with 10 to 15 high quality galaxies for each field . from the residuals",
    ", we infer that the transformations are typically good to @xmath232 mas , which corresponds to a 0.31 mas yr@xmath7  systematic uncertainty in the reference frame for a 3 yr time baseline .",
    "the systematic uncertainty is a noise floor to all of our measurements .",
    "finally , we use these galaxy - based transformations to map the position for each star in each exposure into the reference frame , and then solve for the proper motions .",
    "mathematically , the proper motion calculation boils down to a linear least squares fit to the x and y positions vs.  time of observation , which we know exactly .",
    "we convert the x and y pixel motions into mas yr@xmath7  using the appropriate camera pixel scale , image rotation angle , and time baseline of observations .",
    "proper motion uncertainties are determined from the scatter in x and y positions at each epoch , and added in quadrature to the uncertainty of the galaxy reference frame .",
    "total measurement uncertainties range from @xmath233 mas yr@xmath7  for the case of , which has a 6.36 yr time baseline of observations , to @xmath234 mas yr@xmath7  for the case of , which has only 8 useable reference galaxies .",
    "our final proper motion measurements are in table [ tab : hvs ] .",
    "our proper motion measurements are a 6-fold improvement over previous measurements .",
    "one of the most accurate proper motion catalogs available today is the ucac4 , which covers the entire sky to a depth of @xmath235 mag @xcite .",
    "one of our stars , b  733 , is bright enough to have a ucac4 measurement .",
    "the ucac4 total proper motion for b  733 , @xmath236 mas yr@xmath7 , agrees to within 1.5@xmath0 of our measurement @xmath237 mas yr@xmath7 .",
    "another catalog is ppmxl @xcite , which combines 2mass and usno - b astrometry .",
    "only b  733 is bright enough to have a 2mass measurement , and the ppmxl total proper motion @xmath238 mas yr@xmath7  is in perfect agreement with our measurement .",
    "the sdss survey probes much deeper and , when combined with usno - b astrometry @xcite , provides proper motion measurements for all of our sample except .",
    "the average sdss - usno - b proper motion uncertainty for our stars is @xmath239 mas yr@xmath7 , and only one star , , has a sdss proper motion that differs from zero at greater than 1.5@xmath0 significance .",
    "in contrast , our _ hst _ measurements have an average proper motion uncertainty of @xmath11 mas yr@xmath7 , and thus are 6.6 times more accurate .      at first glance ,",
    "the stars have small proper motions and thus largely radial trajectories .",
    "twelve of the stars have proper motions statistically consistent with zero . only , b  434 , b  485 , and b  733 have proper motions that differ from zero at better than 3@xmath0 significance .    for distant stars",
    ", however , the reflex motion caused by the sun orbiting the milky way can dominate the apparent proper motion .",
    "the direction and amplitude of solar reflex motion depends on the location and distance of the star .",
    "thus , a correct interpretation of the proper motion measurements requires that we calculate trajectories .    as a first step , we adopt a fixed distance , radial velocity , right ascension , and declination ( those listed in table [ tab : hvs ] ) for each star , and then calculate each trajectory backward in time for all possible proper motions that cross the galactic plane .",
    "we use the @xcite three component bulge - disk - halo potential model for the trajectory calculations .",
    "this potential model uniquely fits observed mass measurements from the galactic center to the outer halo , but was originally constructed for a 220  circular velocity @xcite . updating the disk mass @xmath240",
    "@xmath10  and disk radial scale length @xmath241 kpc yields a flat rotation curve of 235   consistent with the most recent circular velocity measurements @xcite .",
    "we refer to this potential model as the @xcite model , and use it in all of our trajectory calculations .    assuming a fixed distance , radial velocity , right ascension , and declination ( those listed in table [ tab : hvs ] ) , figure [ fig : pmall ]",
    "compares our measured proper motions to the results of our trajectory calculations .",
    "the green and blue ellipses show the locus of proper motions with trajectories that pass within 8 and 20 kpc , respectively , of the galactic center .",
    "statistically , all of our stars have proper motions consistent with a milky way origin .",
    "our strongest constraints are for the three closest stars that have significantly non - zero proper motions : , b  711 , and b  733 .",
    "to evaluate the likelihood of a more exact origin requires that we account for all of the measurement errors , in proper motion , radial velocity , and distance .",
    "with proper motions in hand , we can now address the question of origin .",
    "we expect that the fastest unbound stars , as discussed above , are most likely hvss ejected by the mbh in the galactic center .",
    "lower velocity stars can be explained by alternative scenarios , such as runaway ejections from the disk .",
    "importantly , runaways with unbound speeds are most likely to be those stars ejected in the direction of galactic rotation from the outer disk @xcite .",
    "thus we can distinguish between the runaway and mbh ejection scenarios if we know where the trajectories of our stars cross the galactic plane .",
    "the stars in our sample were selected on the basis of their extreme radial velocities .",
    "their trajectories in the galactic frame will therefore point away from the sun unless they have proper motions that significantly deviate from the solar reflex motion .    in reality",
    ", the errors in proper motion are too large to pinpoint the location of ejection with the desired accuracy . to put the measurement uncertainties in context , consider a star s tangential velocity @xmath242 , where @xmath243 is the heliocentric distance in kpc and @xmath244 is the proper motion in mas yr@xmath7 .",
    "the typical star in our sample has a median distance of 50 kpc and a proper motion error of @xmath2450.8 mas yr@xmath7 , thus an error in tangential velocity of @xmath245190 . for the median total space velocity of 650 ,",
    "the uncertainty in the angle of trajectory is @xmath246 . over a distance of 50 kpc ,",
    "the uncertainty in position is thus @xmath24515 kpc .    while we would like to test whether an observed trajectory goes exactly through the galactic center ,",
    "the errors preclude locating a trajectory to any one point .",
    "instead , we use the measurements to try to disprove a galactic center origin .",
    "our approach is to calculate the statistical consistency of the measurements with a galactic center trajectory .",
    "we obtain the same answer to this question whether we calculate trajectories from the star backward in time or from the galactic center forward in time , because the proper motion and distance errors are the same either way .",
    "measurement errors make either the galactic center or the star look very blurry .",
    "we use a monte carlo calculation to account for all of the measurement uncertainties , and visualize the results in a distribution of galactic plane - crossing locations . for each star ,",
    "we draw 1,000,000 current velocities and distances assuming that the measured proper motion , radial velocity , and distance have gaussian random uncertainties .",
    "we then calculate each trajectory backward in time and record where it crosses the galactic plane .",
    "figure [ fig : xyall ] presents the resulting distribution of galactic plane - crossing locations for our sample .",
    "a black star shows the present location of each star , and a solid black line shows its trajectory .",
    "magenta and cyan ellipses show the 1@xmath0 and 2@xmath0 likelihood plane - crossing regions , respectively .",
    "we determine these regions by calculating the density of plane - crossing locations in bins of x and y , and solving for the density level thresholds that contain 68.26% and 95.44% of all the crossings within them .",
    "the contours are centered on the mode of the plane - crossing distributions , which can differ from the mean trajectory ( black line ) .",
    "drawing both a large distance and a large proper motion can result in a very large tangential motion and thus an extreme plane - crossing location .",
    "we discard those trajectories that fail to cross the galactic plane within the main sequence lifetime of each star . for reference",
    ", a 3 @xmath10  star has a 365 myr main sequence lifetime in the padova tracks ; for the special cases hvs  2 and hvs  3 , we allow flight times of 1 gyr and 100 myr , respectively .",
    "these flight time constraints exclude fewer than 1% of trajectories for most of the sample .    because distance and proper motion are the most uncertain parameters , the size and shape of the galactic plane - crossing likelihood regions are driven by the distance and proper motion uncertainties .",
    "there is no visible change in the galactic plane - crossing likelihood regions if we use a different potential model , specifically the one based on @xcite and updated in @xcite .",
    "similarly , a triaxial halo potential model , like that expected from cosmological simulations , changes the trajectories very little .",
    "half of our stars have trajectories that formally cross the galactic plane at @xmath247 kpc , outside of the milky way disk , but all of our stars include a part of the milky way within their 1@xmath0 plane - crossing likelihood regions . only one star , , has a trajectory moving opposite to the direction of galactic rotation .",
    "is also our most uncertain proper motion measurement . because a counter - rotation trajectory requires an unphysically large galactic plane ejection velocity",
    ", we consider the astrometric link between the short- and long - exposures of suspect .",
    "many more stars , including , , , and b  485 , have very radial trajectories .",
    "we reject the galactic center origin hypothesis if the galactic center trajectory falls outside the 3@xmath0 ( @xmath248 ) threshold of the distribution ( figure [ fig : xyall ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath249 is determined as the fraction of all possible orbits with the density of plane - crossings below the value at the gc bin ( x=0,y=0 ) .",
    "this respresents the consistency of the galactic center trajectory with the measurement uncertainties . by this estimate of probability ,",
    "13 of our stars are consistent with a galactic center origin within about the @xmath250 ( @xmath251 ) confidence level . as a sanity check ,",
    "we obtain essentially the same result if we ignore the potential model and simply compare a perfectly radial trajectory against the observed tangential velocities .",
    "tangential velocity error drives the probability .",
    "only the stars , b  711 , and b  733 have measurements inconsistent with a galactic center origin at @xmath123@xmath0 ( @xmath248 ) confidence : they are runaways .",
    "we discuss these objects in more detail below .",
    "hvs  2 is a helium rich sdo star with a @xmath252  heliocentric radial velocity @xcite .",
    "the two proposed explanations for its extreme motion are an ejection by the central mbh @xcite or a type ia supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "hvs  2 has a significant proper motion of @xmath253 mas yr@xmath7 .",
    "our measurement is based on three epochs of imaging and therefore has a very well understood error distribution . given @xmath254 kpc heliocentric distance @xcite",
    ", the observed proper motion corresponds to a @xmath255  tangential motion .",
    "tangential motion is quite similar to its radial velocity .",
    "thus its space motion in the rest frame of the milky way is almost exactly 1,000 ( ! ) .",
    "the direction of proper motion takes its trajectory across the galactic plane at @xmath256 kpc .",
    "this result implies that originates from the stellar halo , possibly launched by a type ia supernova explosion as proposed by @xcite and @xcite . if distance and proper motion are 1@xmath0 smaller , however , its tangential motion is less extreme and it crosses the galactic plane around @xmath257 kpc ( see figure [ fig : xyall ] ) .",
    "thus an ejection from the disk is a viable possibility .    a galactic center origin for , on the other hand ,",
    "is ruled out at greater than 3@xmath0 confidence .",
    "closest approach to the galactic center , given the measurement errors , is @xmath258 kpc among our 1,000,000 monte carlo trajectory calculations . in other words , the extreme velocity of",
    "can not be explained by a dynamical interaction via gravitational interaction with the central mbh .",
    "instead , it is an example of a hyper - runaway star .",
    "@xcite perform ejection calculations for helium star companions to white dwarfs that explode in type ia supernovae . in this model ,",
    "the helium stars receive a kick perpendicular to their orbital velocity for total ejection velocities of 500  650 . similarly , @xcite calculate a 600  velocity from their type ia supernova ejection model . given these ejection velocities ,",
    "the type ia supernova model can not explain 1,000  motion with a disk ejection ; trajectory is not even in the direction of galactic rotation ( figure [ fig : xyall ] ) .",
    "@xcite s aysmmetric core - collapse supernova model can produce 1,000  velocities for low mass stars",
    ". however , there would not be enough time for a low mass star to evolve into an sdo star before its core - collapse companion launches it out of the galaxy .",
    "the remaining possibility is that was launched by a type ia supernova from a halo binary traveling at @xmath1400  in its current direction of motion .",
    "alternative origins seem less likely .",
    "for example , @xcite propose that the tidal disruption of a dwarf galaxy can explain unbound stars .",
    "this mechanism requires the close peri - center passage of a fairly massive @xmath259 @xmath10  dwarf to produce unbound stars @xcite .",
    "the non - galactic - center trajectory of , plus the absence of other unbound stars around it , would appear to rule out the dwarf galaxy tidal debris origin .",
    "additional evidence for a type ia supernova explosion , perhaps found in the abundance pattern of stellar atmosphere , would better support the supernova origin picture .",
    "b  711 and b  733 are both bound b - type stars at modest 9  17 kpc distances , and thus plausible candidates for being runaway b stars ejected from the disk .",
    "alternatively , they could be failed hvss on bound trajectories from the galactic center .",
    "their radial velocities in the galactic frame are 290 and 440 , respectively . in the absence of a positive @xmath14  measurement for b  711",
    ", it is also possible that b  711 could be an evolved low mass star ( i.e.  a hot horizontal branch star ) orbiting in the stellar halo .",
    "the fact that b  733 is a rapidly rotating 2.5 @xmath10  main - sequence star with a 349  heliocentric radial velocity , however , requires that it was ejected from a location in the galaxy with recent star formation .",
    "we measure proper motions that point to a disk runaway origin for both stars .",
    "the stars formally cross the galactic plane at @xmath260 kpc ( figure [ fig : xyall ] ) .",
    "a galactic center origin is ruled out at greater than 3@xmath0 confidence for both stars .",
    "the trajectories of b  711 and b  733 cross the galactic plane at angles nearly perpendicular to galactic rotation , however , implying disk ejection velocities of 533  and 441 .",
    "the supernova ejection mechanism is able to achieve 500  velocities for main - sequence stars only in extreme scenarios @xcite .",
    "the dynamical ejection mechanism can achieve 500  velocities for main - sequence stars but requires 3-body interactions with contact binaries containing 100 @xmath10  stars @xcite .",
    "stars with 100 @xmath10  are rare and short - lived .",
    "simulations suggest that perhaps 0.1% of dynamical ejections reach 500  velocities @xcite .",
    "the upshot is that we expect to find more galactic center ejections than disk runaway ejections at these speeds @xcite .",
    "the fact that b  711 and b  733 are @xmath230500  disk runaway ejections is thus quite intriguing .    because extreme runaway ejections require massive stars with relatively short lifetimes , we expect b  711 and b  733 to have flight times similar to their stellar ages .",
    "our proper motions correspond to trajectories with 20 - 40 myr flight times from the disk .",
    "our spectroscopic @xmath5  measurements favor young ages for both b  711 and b  733 ( see figure [ fig : teff ] ) , however the uncertainties are large and no statistically meaningful constraint is currently possible .",
    "high resolution echelle spectroscopy of b  711 and b  733 would thus be very interesting .",
    "b  733 is clearly a main - sequence star on the basis of its rapid rotation , and its trajectory is thus evidence for an extreme stellar dynamical ejection from the disk like that seen for @xcite and @xcite .",
    "hvs  3 is the unbound 9 @xmath10  main - sequence b star near the lmc on the sky @xcite .",
    "if comes from the lmc , then its speed is evidence for a mbh hidden somewhere in the lmc @xcite .",
    "if comes from the milky way , then its speed and stellar nature are evidence of a former binary hvs ejection @xcite .",
    "both origins are unlikely in terms of ejection rates .    in 2010",
    ", we published a proper motion for that pointed to a milky way origin @xcite . this measurement was based on two epochs of acs imaging with a 3.46 yr time baseline .",
    "the readout direction of the acs ccd was unfortunately aligned with the milky way - lmc direction , however , and added an additional systematic uncertainty .",
    "we now have a third epoch of wfc3 imaging , obtained at an orientation angle 90 deg from the previous data sets , that doubles our time baseline .",
    "our expectation is that intrinsic motion now dominates the errors .",
    "we re - process and re - analyze the epoch 1 and 2 data in the same way as the epoch 3 data , so that everything is in a common reference frame .",

    "we plot in panel a ) the position of , relative to its mean position , as measured in each individual image .",
    "different epochs are identified by color , and the scatter in positions reflects the underlying precision of our measurements .",

    "this motion is quantified in figure panels b ) and c ) , which plot the ra and dec positions of versus time .",
    "the solid lines in each panel show the linear least squares fit to the measurements .",
    "the proper motion of is @xmath262 mas yr@xmath7 .    as fate",
    "would have it , our proper motion corresponds to a physical trajectory that passes in - between the milky way and lmc .",
    "figure [ fig : hvs3 ] panel d ) is identical to figure [ fig : pmall ] except that we now draw the locus of proper motions with trajectories that pass within 3 kpc of the lmc ( red ellipse ) .",
    "a 3 kpc radius encompasses the full extent of the lmc bar and all of the young clusters proposed by @xcite for the origin of .",
    "we determine distance to the lmc in figure [ fig : hvs3 ] assuming that the lmc has a mass of @xmath263 @xmath10  moving on an orbit that reproduces the line - of - sight velocity from @xcite and the proper motion from @xcite in our milky way potential model .",
    "if we account for the uncertainties in and lmc distances , then both lmc and milky way origins are consistent with the measurements at the 1@xmath0 level .",
    "the ambiguity on origin is driven by our epoch 3 measurements , which exhibit a larger shift , and scatter , in position than seen in epochs 1 and 2 .",
    "this result is visually apparent in figure [ fig : hvs3 ] .",
    "fitting only the epoch 1 and 2 measurements yields @xmath264 mas yr@xmath7 , in 1@xmath0 agreement with our previously published value @xcite . fitting only epoch 2 and 3 measurements , on the other hand , yields @xmath265 mas yr@xmath7 .",
    "clearly , the third epoch drives the proper motion to larger values , and thus causes trajectory to move away from the milky way in physical space .",
    "we repeat our measurement and analysis for hvs  3 using only the 5 best galaxies and obtain essentially the same result .",
    "our reference frame thus appears robust .",
    "we speculate that the f850lp filter , chosen to maximize s / n on the background galaxies while not saturating the bright blue star , may be partly to blame .",
    "the f850lp filter has a less well - calibrated distortion solution than the f814w and f606w filters , which were used for all of our other observations .",
    "the other hvss with three epochs of data all have less scatter between epochs : the proper motions derived from epochs 1 and 2 and derived from epochs 2 and 3 agree at the @xmath8 level , except for the dec motion of hvs  2 that differs by @xmath250 .",
    "residual cte systematic error is also a possible problem for the hvs  3 observations .",
    "answering the question of origin will ultimately require a proper motion measurement with a longer time baseline of observations , or else a better instrument like _",
    "we present _ hst _ proper motion measurements for 16 stars with extreme radial velocities , 12 of which are unbound to the milky way . on the basis of spectroscopic stellar atmosphere",
    "fits , our sample consists of 15 main - sequence b stars and 1 helium - rich sdo star located at 10  100 kpc distances in the stellar halo .",
    "we expect that the fastest stars are likely hvss ejected by the central mbh , and that the lower velocity stars may be runaways ejected from the milky way disk .",
    "we process our images using the best geometric distortion solutions , cte corrections , and empirical point spread function fits .",
    "our final proper motions have an average uncertainty of @xmath11 mas yr@xmath7 , a 6-fold improvement over previous measurements .",
    "twelve of our stars have proper motions consistent with zero , and thus largely radial trajectories .    given the uncertainties in proper motion and distance , the data allow for a wide range of origin locations .",
    "we calculate the statistical consistency of the data with a galactic center trajectory in an attempt to disprove the galactic center origin hypothesis .",
    "we find that a galactic center trajectory remains consistent with the measurements for 13 of our stars within the 2@xmath0 confidence level .",
    "only the stars , b  711 , and b  733 are inconsistent with a galactic center origin at @xmath123@xmath0 confidence , and thus runaways .",

    "its 1,000  motion is in some tension with the supernova ejection model , but can be explained if was ejected from a halo orbit .",
    "b  711 and b  733 , on the other hand , are b stars with trajectories that clearly point from the stellar disk .",
    "these two stars are thus runaway stars , and their trajectories provide strong evidence for @xmath1500  ejections from the disk .",

    "better constraints on hvs trajectories and origin will come from improved proper motion measurements .",
