    "for chaotic systems the density of classical periodic orbits with a given length increases exponentially . in particular , for all constant negative curvature surfaces generated by discrete groups one has the universal asymptotics ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath0 much less is known about multiplicities of periodic orbits with exactly the same length .",
    "usually it is assumed that the mean length multiplicity of periodic orbits for generic systems depends only on exact symmetries and for models without geometrical symmetries the mean multiplicity @xmath1 equals @xmath2 or @xmath3 for systems respectively with or without time - reversal invariance .",
    "physically it means that , in general , there exists no reason that two different periodic orbits would have the same length except for time - reversal invariant systems where almost all trajectories can be traversed in two opposite directions which implies that @xmath4 . in semiclassical approach to spectral statistics of chaotic systems the distinction between these two classes of models is reflected in different behaviour of the two - point correlation form factor at the origin which agrees with the predictions of the random matrix theory @xcite , @xcite .    for the free motion on constant negative curvature surfaces generated by discrete groups",

    "periodic orbits are in one - to - one correspondence with conjugacy classes of group matrices and the length of a periodic orbit , @xmath5 , is directly related with the trace of a matrix @xmath6 representing each class ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath7 hence , any relations between traces of group matrices imply connections between periodic orbit lengths .",
    "the extreme case corresponds to the so - called arithmetic groups ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . for such groups traces of group matrices can take only quite restricted set of values and the number of possible traces less than a given value is asymptotically @xcite @xmath8 with a system dependent constant @xmath9 . because @xmath10 but not all possible values of traces really appear for group matrices , the number of periodic orbits with different lengths when @xmath11 has the following upper bound @xcite @xmath12 define the mean multiplicity of periodic orbit length as the ratio of the density of all periodic orbit to the density of periodic orbits with different lengths @xmath13 where @xmath14 .    from the above formulas one proves @xcite that for arithmetic groups the mean multiplicity is exponentially large and has the following estimate from below @xmath15 in classical mechanics such large multiplicities play a minor role but their interference changes drastically quantum mechanics of arithmetic groups . in particular , spectral statistics of arithmetic systems",

    "periodic orbits for the hecke group @xmath22 ( with unit determinant ) are free words of letters @xmath127 , the only restriction being that all cyclic permutations of a word give one orbit .",

    "we say that a function @xmath132 has the h - property with a separating point @xmath133 if @xmath134 the importance of this notion follows from the fact that if @xmath135 and @xmath136 both have the h - property with separating point @xmath133 then @xmath137 and @xmath138 also have the h - property with the same separating point .",

    "let us prove first that matrix elements @xmath139 with @xmath140 have the h - property with the separating point @xmath141 .",
    "indeed @xmath142 when @xmath143 the equality sign in this inequality holds at the points @xmath144 where @xmath145 is an odd integer @xmath146 .",

    "third , as was stated above , all matrix elements obtained by taking the products of arbitrary number of matrices @xmath127 also have the h - property with the separating constant @xmath160 .    combining all these arguments",

    "<S> it is demonstrated both numerically and analytically that at least for certain groups the mean multiplicity of periodic orbits with exactly the same length increases exponentially with the length . </S>",
    "<S> the main ingredient used is the construction of joint distribution of periodic orbits when group matrices are transformed by field isomorphisms . </S>",
    "<S> the method can be generalized to other groups for which traces of group matrices are integers of an algebraic field of finite degree . </S>"
