    "since the work of arratia  @xcite on annihilating random walks , it is known that , when starting with infinitely many supporters of each opinion , the one - dimensional voter model fluctuates , i.e. , the number of opinion changes at each vertex is almost surely infinite . in contrast , as a consequence of irreducibility , the process on finite connected graphs fixates to a configuration in which all the vertices share the same opinion .",
    "the objective of this paper is to study the dichotomy between fluctuation and fixation for a general class of opinion models with confidence threshold .",
    "the main novelty is to equip the set of opinions with the structure of a connected graph and use the induced graph distance to define mathematically a level of disagreement among individuals .",
    "based on this modeling approach , some of the most popular models of opinion dynamics can be recovered by choosing the structure of the opinion space suitably : the constrained voter model , independently introduced in  @xcite , is obtained by assuming that the opinion space is a path , while the axelrod model for the dissemination of cultures  @xcite and the discrete deffuant model  @xcite are closely related to our models when the opinion space is a hamming graph and a hypercube , respectively .",
    "* model description *  the class of models considered in this article are examples of interacting particle systems inspired from the voter model  @xcite for the dynamics of opinions .",
    "individuals are located on the vertex set of a connected graph and characterized by their opinion , with the set of opinions being identified with the vertex set of another connected graph .",
    "the former graph represents the underlying spatial structure and is used to determine the interaction neighborhood of each individual .",
    "the latter graph , that we call the opinion graph , represents the structure of the opinion space and is used to determine the distance between two opinions and the level of disagreement between two individuals . from now on ,",
    "we call spatial distance the graph distance induced by the spatial structure and opinion distance the graph distance induced by the opinion graph .",
    "individuals interact with each of their neighbors at rate one . as the result of an interaction ,",
    "an individual imitates her neighbor if and only if the distance between their opinions just before the interaction does not exceed some confidence threshold  @xmath0 .",
    "more formally , we let @xmath1 be two connected graphs , where  @xmath2 is also assumed to be finite . then",
    ", our opinion model is the continuous - time markov chain whose state at time  @xmath3 is a spatial configuration @xmath4 and with transition rates at vertex  @xmath5 given by @xmath6 here , the set  @xmath7 denotes the interaction neighborhood of vertex  @xmath8 , i.e. , all the vertices which are at spatial distance one from  @xmath8 , while  @xmath9 refers to the opinion distance between  @xmath10 and  @xmath11 , which is the length of the shortest path connecting both opinions on the opinion graph .",
    "note that the classical voter model is simply obtained by assuming that the opinion graph consists of two vertices connected by an edge and that the confidence threshold equals one .",
    "the general class of opinion models described by the transition rates   where the opinion space is represented by a finite connected graph equipped with its graph distance has been recently introduced in  @xcite .    * main results *  the main question about",
    "the general model is whether the system fluctuates and clusters , leading ultimately the population to a global consensus , or fixates in a highly fragmented configuration .",
    "recall that the process is said to    * * fluctuate * when  @xmath12 for all  @xmath5 , * * fixate * when  @xmath13 for all  @xmath5 , * * cluster * when  @xmath14 as  @xmath15 for all  @xmath16 .",
    "note that whether the system fluctuates and clusters or fixates in a fragmented configuration is very sensitive to the initial configuration .",
    "also , throughout this paper , we assume that the process starts from a product measure with densities which are constant across space , i.e. , @xmath17 only depends on opinion  @xmath11 but not on site  @xmath8 . to avoid trivialities ,",
    "these densities are assumed to be positive .",
    "sometimes , we will make the stronger assumption that all the opinions are equally likely at time zero .",
    "these two hypotheses correspond to the following two conditions : @xmath18 where  @xmath19 refers to the total number of opinions .",
    "key quantities to understand the long - term behavior of the system are the radius and the diameter of the opinion graph defined respectively as the minimum and maximum eccentricity of any vertex : @xmath20 to state our first theorem , we also introduce the subset @xmath21 that we shall call the  * @xmath22-center * of the opinion graph . the next result states that , whenever the confidence threshold is at least equal to the radius of the opinion graph , the infinite one - dimensional system fluctuates and clusters while the probability that the finite system reaches ultimately a consensus , i.e. , fixates in a configuration where all the individuals share the same opinion , is bounded from below by a positive constant that does not depend on the size of the spatial structure . here ,",
    "infinite one - dimensional means that the spatial structure is the graph with vertex set  @xmath23 and where each vertex is connected to its two nearest neighbors .    ",
    "[ th : fluctuation ] assume  . then ,    1 .",
    "the process on  @xmath23 fluctuates whenever @xmath24    assume in addition that  @xmath25 .",
    "then ,    1 .   the process on  @xmath23 clusters and 2 .   the probability of consensus on any finite connected graph satisfies @xmath26    we will show that the  @xmath22-center is nonempty if and only if the threshold is at least equal to the radius so the probability of consensus in the last part is indeed positive .",
    "in fact , except when the threshold is at least equal to the diameter , in which case all three conclusions of the theorem turn out to be trivial , when the threshold is at least equal to the radius , both the  @xmath22-center and its complement are nonempty , and therefore form a partition that satisfies  . in particular , fluctuation also holds when the radius is not more than the threshold .",
    "we also point out that the last part of the theorem implies that the average domain length in the final absorbing state scales like the population size , namely  @xmath27 .",
    "this result applies in particular to the constrained voter model where the opinion graph is a path with three vertices interpreted as leftists , centrists and rightists , thus contradicting the conjecture on domain length scaling in  @xcite .",
    "we now seek for sufficient conditions for fixation of the infinite one - dimensional system , beginning with general opinion graphs . at least for the process starting from the uniform product measure",
    ", these conditions can be expressed using @xmath28 which is the number of pairs of opinions at opinion distance  @xmath29 of each other . in the statement of the next theorem",
    ", the function  @xmath30 refers to the ceiling function .    ",
    "[ th : fixation ] for the opinion model on  @xmath23 , fixation occurs    1 .   when   holds and @xmath31 2 .",
    "for some initial distributions   when  @xmath32 .    combining theorems  [ th : fluctuation].a and  [ th",
    ": fixation].b shows that these two results are sharp when  @xmath33 , which holds for opinion graphs such as paths and stars : for such graphs , the one - dimensional system fluctuates starting from any initial distribution   if and only if  @xmath25 .    our last theorem , which is also the most challenging result of this paper , gives a significant improvement of the previous condition for fixation for * distance - regular * opinion graphs .",
    "this class of graphs is defined mathematically as follows : let @xmath34 be the * distance partition * of",
    "the vertex set  @xmath35 for some  @xmath36 .",
    "then , the opinion graph is said to be a distance - regular graph when the so - called * intersection numbers * @xmath37 only depend on the distance  @xmath38 but not on the particular choice of  @xmath39 and  @xmath40 .",
    "this implies that , for distance - regular opinion graphs , the number of vertices @xmath41 does not depend on vertex  @xmath10 .",
    "to state our last theorem , we let @xmath42 where by convention an empty sum is equal to zero and an empty product is equal to one , and where the coefficients  @xmath43 and  @xmath44 are defined in terms of the intersection numbers as @xmath45 then , we have the following sufficient condition for fixation .     [ th : dist - reg ] assume   and  .",
    "then , the process on  @xmath23 fixates when @xmath46    to understand the coefficients  @xmath43 and  @xmath44 , we note that , letting  @xmath39 and  @xmath11 be two opinions at opinion distance  @xmath47 of each other , we have the following interpretation : @xmath48    * outline of the proofs *  the lower bound for the probability of consensus on finite connected graphs follows from the optional stopping theorem after proving that the process that keeps track of the number of supporters of opinions belonging to the  @xmath22-center is a martingale .",
    "the analysis of the infinite system is more challenging .",
    "the first key to all our proofs is to use the formal machinery introduced in  @xcite that consists in keeping track of the disagreements along the edges of the spatial structure .",
    "this technique has also been used in  @xcite to study related models . in the context of our general opinion model",
    ", we put a pile of  @xmath29 particles on edges that connect individuals who are at opinion distance  @xmath29 of each other , i.e. , we set @xmath49 the definition of the confidence threshold implies that , piles with at most  @xmath22 particles , that we call active , evolve according to symmetric random walks , while larger piles , that we call frozen , are static .",
    "in addition , the jump of an active pile onto another pile results in part of the particles being annihilated . the main idea to prove fluctuation is to show that , after identifying opinions that belong to the same member of the partition  , the process reduces to the voter model , and use that the one - dimensional voter model fluctuates according to  @xcite .",
    "fluctuation , together with the stronger assumption  @xmath25 , implies that the frozen piles , and ultimately all the piles of particles , go extinct , which is equivalent to clustering of the opinion model .",
    "in contrast , fixation occurs when the frozen piles have a positive probability of never being reduced , which is more difficult to establish . to briefly explain our approach to prove fixation",
    ", we say that the pile at  @xmath50 is of order  @xmath51 when @xmath52 to begin with , we use a construction due to  @xcite to obtain an implicit condition for fixation in terms of the initial number of piles of any given order in a large interval .",
    "large deviation estimates for the number of such piles are then proved and used to turn this implicit condition into the explicit condition  . to derive this condition",
    ", we use that at least  @xmath53 active piles must jump onto a pile initially of order  @xmath54 to turn this pile into an active pile .",
    "condition   is obtained assuming the worst case scenario when the number of particles that annihilate is maximal . to show the improved condition for fixation   for distance - regular opinion graphs",
    ", we use the same approach but count more carefully the number of annihilating events .",
    "first , we use duality - like techniques to prove that , when the opinion graph is distance - regular , the system of piles becomes markov .",
    "this is used to prove that the jump of an active pile onto a pile of order  @xmath55 reduces / increases its order with respective probabilities at most  @xmath43 and at least  @xmath44 .",
    "this implies that the number of active piles that must jump onto a pile initially of order  @xmath54 to turn it into an active pile is stochastically larger than the first hitting time to state  1 of a certain discrete - time birth and death process .",
    "this hitting time is equal in distribution to @xmath56 the probabilities  @xmath43 and  @xmath44 are respectively the death parameter and the birth parameter of the discrete - time birth and death process while the integer  @xmath57 is the number of states of this process , which is also the maximum order of a pile .",
    "* application to concrete opinion graphs * ",
    "we now apply our general results to particular opinion graphs , namely the ones which are represented in figure  [ fig : graphs ] .",
    "first , we look at paths and more generally stars with  @xmath58 branches of equal length . for paths",
    ", one can think of the individuals as being characterized by their position about one issue , ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree .",
    "for stars , individuals are offered  @xmath58 alternatives : the center represents undecided individuals while vertices far from the center are more extremist in their position .",
    "these graphs are not distance - regular so we can only apply theorem  [ th : fixation ] to study fixation of the infinite system .",
    "this theorem combined with theorem  [ th : fluctuation ] gives the following two corollaries .",
    " [ cor : path ] when  @xmath2 is the path with  @xmath59 vertices ,    * the system fluctuates when   holds and  @xmath60 whereas * the system fixates when   holds and  @xmath61 .    ",

    "next , we look at the case where the individuals are characterized by some preferences represented by the set of vertices of a cycle . for instance , as explained in  @xcite , all strict orderings of three alternatives can be represented by the cycle with  @xmath72 vertices .    ",

    "these polynomials are obtained from the conditions in corollaries  [ cor : path][cor : star ] by only keeping the terms with degree two .",
    "to study the one - dimensional system , it is convenient to construct the process from a graphical representation and to introduce a coupling between the opinion model and a certain system of annihilating particles that keeps track of the discrepancies along the edges of the lattice rather than the opinion at each vertex .",
    "this system of particles can also be constructed from the same graphical representation . since the opinion model on general finite graphs",

    "the dynamics of the opinion model induces the following evolution rules on this system of particles . assuming that there is an arrow  @xmath131 at time  @xmath3 and that @xmath132 we have the following alternative :    * in case  @xmath133 , meaning that there is no particle on the edge",

    "similar evolution rules are obtained by exchanging the direction of the interaction from which we deduce the following description for the dynamics of piles :    * piles with more than  @xmath22 particles can not move : we call such piles * frozen piles * and the particles in such piles frozen particles . *",

    ", we first observe that opinions on the hypercube can be represented by vectors with coordinates equal to zero or one while the distance between two opinions is the number of coordinates the two corresponding vectors disagree on . in particular , the number of opinions at distance  @xmath29 of a given opinion , namely  @xmath427 , is equal to the number of subsets of size  @xmath29 of a set of size  @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , we have the symmetry property @xmath428 from which it follows that , for  @xmath429 , @xmath430 since in addition the function  @xmath431 is nondecreasing , a direct application of theorem  [ th : fixation ] gives the first part of the corollary .",
    "the second part is more difficult .",
    "note that , to prove this part , it suffices to show that , for any fixed  @xmath432 , fixation occurs when @xmath433 the main difficulty is to find a good upper bound for  @xmath434 which relies on properties of the hypergeometric random variable .",
    "let  @xmath435 and  @xmath436 be two opinions at distance  @xmath47 of each other . by symmetry ,",
    "we may assume without loss of generality that both vectors disagree on their first  @xmath47 coordinates .",
    "then , changing each of the first  @xmath47 coordinates in either one vector or the other vector and changing each of the remaining coordinates in either both vectors simultaneously or none of the vectors result in the same vector .",
    "in particular , choosing a vector  @xmath437 such that @xmath438 is equivalent to choosing  @xmath439 of the first  @xmath47 coordinates and then choosing  @xmath58 of the remaining  @xmath440 coordinates with the following constraint : @xmath441 in particular , letting  @xmath442 , we have @xmath443 where  @xmath444 . in order to find an upper bound for  @xmath434 and deduce fixation , we first prove the following lemma about the hypergeometric random variable .",
    "the proof is made challenging by the fact that there is no explicit expression for the cumulative distribution function of the hypergeometric random variable and the idea is to use a combination of symmetry arguments and large deviation estimates .",
    "symmetry is used to prove the result when  @xmath47 is small while large deviation estimates are used for larger values .",
    "note that the result is trivial when  @xmath448 since in this case the sum in the statement of the lemma is empty so equal to zero . to prove the result when the sum is nonempty , we distinguish two cases . + * small active piles *  assume that  @xmath449 .",
    "then , @xmath450 from which it follows that @xmath451 using   and again the second part of  , we deduce that @xmath452 in particular , we have  @xmath453 , which gives the result . + * larger active piles *  assume that  @xmath454 . in this case , the result is a consequence of the following large deviation estimates for the hypergeometric random variable : @xmath455 for all  @xmath456 , that can be found in  @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath457 for all  @xmath458 .",
    "it follows that @xmath459 which , together with   for  @xmath460 , gives @xmath461 since this tends to zero as  @xmath462 , the proof is complete .",
    "+   + it directly follows from the lemma that @xmath463 this , together with   and  @xmath411 and  @xmath419 , implies that @xmath464 finally , using again   and the fact that  @xmath465 , we deduce that @xmath466 the corollary follows once more from theorem  [ th : dist - reg ] ."
