    "the most precise determination of the properties of finite many - electron systems is usually done by means of a full - configuration - interaction ( fci ) method , where the solution of the corresponding schrdinger equation in a given one - electron basis is expressed in terms of a linear combination of all possible slater determinants .",
    "its application is naturally reduced to a bunch of small systems because of the enormous number of the involved determinants @xcite .",
    "let us highlight that for all fci approaches the correlation effects , which remain solely in the wave function , are not described by any correlation operator .",
    "moreover , these effects are usually numerically computed as a difference of two variational energy bounds .",
    "thus , up to now the electron correlation is widely and implicitly believed to be a purely methodical effect coming from the inadequate use of a trial wave function of multiconfiguration hartree - fock type ; so , lacking of physical reality .",
    "the application of quantum information ideas and techniques in electronic structure theory has recently allowed to conclude that the electron correlation is closely related to entanglement of electrons .",
    "indeed , it has been proved that while the single slater determinant in the monoconfigurational hartree - fock approximation is a disentangled state , the wavefunction of the multiconfiguration hartree - fock approximations ( such as , e.g. fci ) accounts for entanglement effects .",
    "therefore , entanglement plays an essential role not only in quantum communication between parties separated by macroscopic distances ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , but also it is essential to characterize quantum correlations at short distances .",
    "the latter problem , where one should necessarily consider the indistinguishable character of the involved particles , has received relatively less attention until a short time ago @xcite .",
    "this is a serious lack because of its relevance for quantum information processing in various physical systems ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , to gain deeper insight into non - classical correlations of atomic and molecular systems as well as to fully understand the course of their dissociation processes and chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty , however , stems from the fact that the schrdinger equation of most quantum many - body systems can not be solved analytically .",
    "even numerically , the determination of the wavefunction is , in general , a serious problem . in the last three years",
    "an intense effort has been made to determine the entanglement of some real atomic and molecular species such as helium - like atoms @xcite , of a few processes of diatomic molecules @xcite and elementary chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "these works basically focus on the entanglement of bipartite systems , mainly because the characterization of this phenomenon for systems of many indistinguishable constituents is much less known , even at the level of the very notion of entanglement measure @xcite .",
    "thus , the quantification of entanglement of bound states for model systems enabling analytic solutions of the associated schrdinger equation is being a promising way to investigate correlation phenomena .",
    "indeed , entanglement between the constituents of any bound system is most conveniently analyzed in such models , enabling to relate it to the bosonic or fermionic character . up to now",
    ", however , only entanglement of some models of two bound electrons have been determined .",
    "we refer to the 2-harmonium ( or moshinsky ) @xcite , crandall and hooke@xcite atoms .",
    "in all these models the electron confinement is harmonic , and the electron - electron interaction is of harmonic ( 2-harmonium ) , @xmath3 ( crandall ) , and coulombic ( hooke ) type .",
    "all of them show that when the spin degree of freedom and the indistinguishability of electrons are taken into account , new entanglement aspects@xcite are encountered as compared to the model of distinguishable particles , although some further clarification is needed .",
    "it is also worth noting that some entanglement features of the 2-harmonium atom are also qualitatively reproduced by the other two models , which give a good description for certain two - fermion systems ( e.g. , two electrons in a quantum dot is approximately described by the hooke model ) .",
    "namely , the growth of the entanglement when either the relative strength or the excitation energy is increasing .",
    "it is most interesting that recently the entanglement of some real helium - like atoms has been numerically shown to have an increasing dependence on the energy .",
    "this has been done both by the use of very accurate one - electron basis functions of hylleraas - kinoshita type @xcite and some gaussian or slater type orbital basis sets @xcite .",
    "as well it is observed from the models that the entanglement decrease of these systems in terms of the nuclear charge z can also be understood as the result of the relative decrease of the electron - electron - interaction .    in this work",
    "we will study the entanglement of the one - body reduced density matrix of the n - harmonium model for bosons and fermions analytically .",
    "von neumann ( for bosons ) and linear ( for fermions ) entropies will be used .",
    "the one - body reduced matrix for the spinless fermionic case has been previously computed @xcite .",
    "we obtain for the first time an explicit expression of the one - body reduced density matrix for the _ closed - shell _ spinned fermionic - case .",
    "this study will allow us to show that some entanglement features of finite many - particle systems can be understood by purely kinematical considerations to a certain extent .",
    "the n - particle harmonium is a completely - integrable system with an arbitrary number @xmath0 of particles where both the confinement and the two - particle interaction are harmonic .",
    "this model has also been used to study cold atoms @xcite and to gain further insight into numerous phenomena of a variety of physical systems up to black holes ( see e.g. , ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "first , in section [ sec : atom ] we briefly formulate the quantum - mechanical problem of the n - particle harmonium , showing its separability by using the appropriate set of normal coordinates @xcite , and fixing our notational settings .",
    "then , in section [ sec : bosones ] we discuss the general mathematical structure of the one - body reduced density matrix in the bosonic case , obtaining its explicit expression . moreover , we compute and discuss the analytical expression of the von neumann entropy of the one - body reduced density matrix for the n - boson harmonium .",
    "further , in sections [ sec : fermions ] and [ sec : spin ] we obtain explicit expressions for the one - body reduced density matrix of the spinned n - fermion harmonium and analyze the linear entropy of the one - body reduced density matrix , with and without the spin degree of freedom .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks and two appendices are given .",
    "the n - harmonium model is a system of @xmath0 interacting particles ( fermions or bosons ) which interact harmonically in a three - dimensional harmonic well .",
    "it is characterized by the hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the coupling constant of the harmonic well and @xmath7 the coupling of the harmonic interaction between the particles .",
    "the treatment of harmonically interacting bosons by means of this hamiltonian represents the first exact solution of a n - particle system using only conditions on the reduced space of two - particle density matrices @xcite .",
    "this system can be expressed in a separable form ( i.e. , as a system of uncoupled oscillators ) using the set of normal coordinates @xmath8 given by @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "this is an orthogonal transformation of the position variables . a similar change of coordinates for momenta results in a canonical transformation , preserving the symplectic form .",
    "let us call the new set of momenta @xmath11 .",
    "a direct calculation shows that @xmath12 so that the hamiltonian can be expressed in the following separable form @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 depending on the number of particles .",
    "then , the physical solutions of the associated schrdinger equation ( i.e. , the wave functions @xmath16 ) , can be readily obtained . here",
    ", let us first note that ( a ) there is a ground state whenever @xmath17 , and ( b ) the particles are no longer bound if the relative interaction strength @xmath18    on the other hand , let us comment here that the entanglement problem is formulated in terms of reduced density matrices . either directly from the resulting one - particle reduced density matrix or , since the particles are assumed to interact pairwise , in terms of the two - particle density matrix @xmath19 which carries all the necessary information required for calculating the quantum - mechanical properties of the whole system .",
    "the symbol @xmath20 stands for spatial and spin coordinates , @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , the ground state energy of the system can be computed by minimizing a simple linear functional of @xmath22 . in passing ,",
    "let us mention that the n - representability problem for this matrix has proved to be a major challenge for quantum chemistry @xcite .",
    "the one - body density matrix , which is the basic variable in reduced density matrix functional theory @xcite , is then given as @xmath23 by means of the spectral theorem , @xmath24 can be decomposed in terms of its natural spin orbitals @xmath25 and its eigenvalues @xmath26 , the _ natural occupation numbers _ : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , with ( for fermions ) @xmath29 .    for the case of an assembly of bosons we will compute the von neumann entropy of the one - body reduced density matrix finding explicitly the occupation numbers of the system , as described in the next section .",
    "recently , there has been a renewed interest in formulating the reduced density matrix theory using wigner quasidistributions @xcite .",
    "our treatment for bosons will be done by using the wigner function in phase space , what is a natural procedure for these systems .",
    "let us advance that there exists a critical value for the number of particles .",
    "below this critical value ( around 3.5 ) , we will show that for positive values of the coupling constant @xmath7 the first occupation number decreases ( and consequently the von neumann entropy grows ) as the number of particles is increasing . above this value ,",
    "the first occupation number increases as the number of particles is increasing .",
    "moreover , the first occupation number tends to 1 ( and the entropy tends to 0 ) in the limit when the number of particles tends to infinity .    later on , for fermions we use the one - body reduced density matrix to compute an explicit expression for its purity and its linear entropy as well .",
    "let us advance that we will show that in the region of negative coupling @xmath7 , the entropy grows when the number of particles is increasing .",
    "a similar situation is observed in the attractive case for small values of the coupling constant . for large values of @xmath30",
    "the situation is the opposite : when particles are added to the system the entropy decreases . in both bosonic and fermionic cases , we will show that it is possible to calculate these two measures of entanglement as a function of the coupling constant @xmath30 and the number of particles .",
    "in this section we determine the von neumann entropy of the n - boson harmonium ground state in terms of @xmath0 and the relative interaction strength @xmath30 . taking into account",

    "let us now diagonalize this expression by decomposing it into its set of natural orbitals as well as into its occupation numbers .",
