    "<S> topological degeneracy is , together with fractionalization , the hallmark of topological order . </S>",
    "<S> while fractionalization has been demonstrated both theoretically and in laboratories leading to deep insights into our basic understanding of matter , there has been no corresponding success in tracking the evolution of ground - state degeneracy due to the lack of tractable microscopic models with arbitrarily tunable topology of space . in this work however , by computer simulations , we show that lattice versions of multicomponent fractional quantum hall systems are novel playgrounds to fill this void . with wormhole - like defects that connect separated `` universes '' of different components , thus changing the global topology of space , we observe a nontrivial dependence of ground - state degeneracy on the number of defects , equivalent to adding exotic non - abelian quasiparticles called `` genons '' proposed recently in terms of effective topological field theory . </S>",
    "<S> we identify a number of different lattice genons in both abelian and non - abelian phases , with quantum dimensions exceeding those of fundamental quasiparticles in the host states , and provide a promising platform to study their intriguing behavior .        </S>",
    "<S> topologically ordered phases of matter have been a central theme of condensed matter physics in the last decades for both fundamental research @xcite and technological development @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a remarkable fingerprint of topological order is the robust ground - state degeneracy , being insensitive to local details but crucially depending on the global topology of space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a comprehensive study of this dependence on variable topologies was for long challenging in both computer simulations and experiments . </S>",
    "<S> taking two - dimensional systems as an example , the most accessible setups in laboratories only have planar geometry with zero genus . </S>",
    "<S> although the situation could be slightly improved in computer simulations , where various microscopic models can be easily adapted to periodic boundary conditions leading to a torus geometry with unit genus , further progress was extremely difficult due to the lack of tractability of arranging these models on surfaces with higher genus .     </S>",
    "<S> ( upper left panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> defects are introduced through branch cuts ( transparent grey ) where the particles switch layer ( green ) . </S>",
    "<S> we study systems with up to two such branch cuts corresponding to the topologies displayed in the right panel . ]    </S>",
    "<S> a crucial step forward was made in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in which it was proposed that appropriate defects in the system can effectively increase the genus of space , thus enabling us to track the enhancement of topological degeneracy by adding such defects , even though the original system only has planar geometry . </S>",
    "<S> these defects , which were further predicted to carry nontrivial quantum dimensions and obey projective braiding statistics , can be imagined as a new type of extrinsic non - abelian quasiparticle called `` genon '' @xcite : they are different from intrinsic quasiparticles of the host system , thus extending our knowledge of topological order and opening a new possibility of quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> however , this beautiful idea is only based on effective topological field theory , and its actual relevance to microscopic models remains open .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we fill this void by presenting the first evidence of genons in a microscopic lattice model which can favor lattice versions of fractional quantum hall states , i.e. , fractional chern insulators @xcite , and naturally host defects . with compelling results from computer simulations of exact diagonalization </S>",
    "<S> , we explicitly demonstrate the dependence of ground - state degeneracy on the genus of space effectively tuned by lattice defects to high numbers . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide a deep insight into the physical realization of genons in realistic lattice models and open the experimental accessibility of topological orders on high - genus surfaces .        </S>",
    "<S> our model ( see appendix ` tight - binding hamiltonian ' ) is located on a two - dimensional square lattice with two internal degrees of freedom @xmath0 on each lattice site and an effective magnetic flux @xmath1 piercing each elementary plaquette , with @xmath2 integer ( fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : lattice ] ) . for convenience , we refer to the internal degree of freedom as `` layer '' . in the absence of lattice defects </S>",
    "<S> , our model has @xmath3 symmetry associated with exchanging two layers , and its lowest band structure contains two copies of an exactly flat band at zero energy with chern number @xmath4 @xcite .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a specific class of defects into the lattice , which can be considered as @xmath3 twist defects @xcite in the sense that a particle s layer index is flipped when it moves around such a defect once . </S>",
    "<S> it is helpful to imagine that the layer flipping occurs precisely along a branch cut between a pair of defects . in case </S>",
    "<S> a straight hopping line intersects with @xmath5 branch cuts , the particle flips its layer index @xmath5 times . </S>",
    "<S> without loss of generality ( see appendix ` tilted branch cuts ' ) , we arrange a pair of defects at @xmath6 and @xmath7 with a branch cut denoted as @xmath8 along the @xmath9-direction ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lattice ] ) . under periodic boundary conditions in both @xmath10 and @xmath9 directions , </S>",
    "<S> the topology of our model strongly depends on the number of branch cuts ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lattice ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> each branch cut plays a role of a wormhole connecting two tori  @xcite , hence the presence of @xmath11 branch cuts leads to a surface with genus @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> we first diagonalize the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath13 on a periodic lattice of @xmath14 sites to analyze the effect of defects on the band structure . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath15 is divisible by @xmath2 ensuring integer number of unit cells in the @xmath10-direction . in the absence of defects , </S>",
    "<S> the lowest @xmath16 single - particle energy levels are exactly degenerate at zero energy . </S>",
    "<S> such a flatness is distorted by the presence of @xmath11 pairs of defects , and we identify @xmath17 levels with the most significant deviation from the original band structure : @xmath18 of them ( levels @xmath19 ) drop below the original lowest band , and another @xmath18 ( @xmath20 ) move into the original lowest band gap . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , they form nearly degenerate clusters respectively . </S>",
    "<S> an example of the band structure for @xmath21 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sp](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> we further examine the eigenvectors of these @xmath17 levels . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we find that all of them are strongly localized near the defects [ fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : sp](b ) ] , and the localization becomes weaker ( or completely disappears ) for other levels with less deviation from the original band structure . </S>",
    "<S> this localization enables us to do a controlled tuning of deviated energies by local potentials near the defects without significantly distorting the rest of the band structure , as we explain below .        </S>",
    "<S> next we consider @xmath22 bosons interacting via @xmath23body onsite repulsions @xmath24 on the lattice @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is an integer . in this setup , </S>",
    "<S> the ground state in the absence of defects is two copies of model @xmath27 read - rezayi ( rr ) states on the lattice , which reside in the lowest @xmath16 exactly degenerate eigenstates of @xmath13 with filling fraction @xmath28 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> adding defects should not change the filling fraction in the thermodynamic limit , hence the most promising candidate of the ground state for @xmath11 pairs of defects is the @xmath27 rr state on a single @xmath12 surface , residing in the lowest @xmath29 eigenstates of @xmath13 with the same filling fraction @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> in accordance with this we target @xmath31 which also agrees with the continuum prediction in the lowest landau level @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the extra offset @xmath32 is related to a topological quantity called the `` shift '' . to amplify the effect of the interaction , we consider the limit of @xmath29 degenerate eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , in the presence of @xmath11 pairs of defects , eq .  ( [ sg ] ) requires us to flatten the energy dispersion of the lowest @xmath33 eigenstates of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be readily achieved by local perturbations owing to the strong localization of the ingap states near the defects [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sp](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> a simple candidate of such a local potential is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 s and @xmath36 s are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath13 respectively , and @xmath37 is the truncation at a radius @xmath38 around each defect . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant terms in @xmath39 exactly correspond to the localized eigenstates of @xmath13 whose energy dispersion we want to flatten , because other eigenstates staying at @xmath40 have no contributions to @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> this flattening process by @xmath39 is asymptotically exact in the sense that the lowest @xmath41 eigenstates of @xmath42 at @xmath43 will become exactly degenerate again at zero energy and have the same eigenvectors as those of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , a very small @xmath38 is already sufficient to do the flattening very well , with negligible influence on the pertinent eigenvector subspace . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sp](c ) , we show the band structure @xmath44 of @xmath42 with @xmath21 and @xmath45 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the degeneracy between the lowest @xmath41 energy levels indeed becomes better with the increase of @xmath38 , with the flatness @xmath46 significantly increased to @xmath47 for @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding eigenvectors of @xmath42 have a total @xmath49 overlap with those of @xmath13 for @xmath50 and @xmath48 .    after ensuring that a suitably defined new lowest flat band can be recovered , we are now in the position to examine whether interactions can stabilize the @xmath27 rr states in the single high - genus surfaces created in our model , by tracking the evolution of ground - state degeneracy @xmath51 with @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the most realistic @xmath53 case . in the absence of defects , </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is two copies of @xmath54 laughlin states on the torus with degeneracy @xmath55 . after adding one pair of defects , we again get four - fold ground - state degeneracy , which is consistent with the @xmath54 laughlin state on a single @xmath56 surface . </S>",
    "<S> a nontrivial enhancement of the topological degeneracy from @xmath57 to @xmath58 occurs for two pairs of defects ( @xmath59 ) , characterized by eight approximately degenerate ground states at the bottom of many - body energy spectra for various system sizes [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lau](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> these states are separated from other excited states by an energy gap which is significantly larger than the ground - state splitting , and their degeneracy becomes better for larger systems . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the robustness of the topological degeneracy by the spectral flow [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lau](b ) ] : one can see that the eight ground states never mix with other excited states under twisted boundary conditions with the boundary phase . in order to further corroborate the topological nature of these ground states , we compute their particle entanglement spectra ( pes ) @xcite to probe the quasihole excitation property . </S>",
    "<S> we do find a clear gap in the pes , the number of states below which is exactly the same as the counting of corresponding quasihole excitations [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lau](c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> our evidence unambiguously indicates that the ground state in the presence of @xmath11 pairs of defects is the @xmath54 laughlin state on a single @xmath12 surface with degeneracy @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> note also that the splitting of low - lying `` genon '' states is reduced relative to the excitation gap as the system size  and thus the separation of genons  is increased .        </S>",
    "<S> the effect of defects is even more intriguing at higher @xmath61 s for which host systems have intrinsic non - abelian topological orders . in this case , unlike the situation with @xmath53 , one pair of defects can already lead to a nontrivial enhancement of the ground - state degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the case of @xmath62 , the ground state in the absence of defects is two copies of moore - read states on the torus , with a degeneracy @xmath63 for even @xmath64 and @xmath65 for odd @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , after adding only one pair of defects , we observe an enhanced topological degeneracy of ten - fold for all even @xmath66 , which becomes better for larger system sizes and is robust under twisted boundary conditions [ figs .  [ fig : na](a ) and ( c ) ] . by just adding another pair of defects , the ground - state degeneracy is futher enhanced to @xmath67 [ figs .  [ fig : na](b ) and ( d ) ] , with a faster growth rate than the @xmath53 case . the dependence of topological degeneracy on the number of defects convincingly suggests that , by introducing @xmath11 pairs of defects for @xmath62 , we indeed realize the @xmath68 moore - read state on a single @xmath12 surface with degeneracy @xmath69 @xcite . a similar enhancement of the topological degeneracy is also observed for @xmath70 , where the ground - state degeneracy is increased from @xmath71 to @xmath72 by adding @xmath21 pair of defects [ figs .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : na](e ) ] , which is consistent with the @xmath73 @xmath74 rr state on a single @xmath12 surface with degeneracy @xmath75 $ ] @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced topological degeneracy strongly indicates that the defects in our systems can indeed be thought of as genons . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , each genon ( or defect ) in our model carries a distinct nontrivial quantum dimension @xmath76 , i.e. , its average contribution to the total degeneracy in the thermodynamic limit , from the intrinsic quasiparticle of the corresponding host state . for example , we have non - abelian genons with @xmath77 at @xmath54 , although the laughlin state only has abelian quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> more saliently , genons at @xmath68 in our model have @xmath78 thus allowing for universal quantum computation , while the quasiparticles of moore - read state itself can not . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we obtain genons with even higher quantum dimension @xmath79 at @xmath73 . these differences , </S>",
    "<S> together with the distinctive projective braiding statistics of defects @xcite , imply the possibility that defects are more powerful tools for topological quantum computation than ordinary quasiparticles .    </S>",
    "<S> the key ingredients of our proposal are already experimentally available and their combined syntesis is plausibly within reach  especially for coupled laughlin states emerging from a particularly simple onsite two - body interaction . </S>",
    "<S> artificial gauge fields generated by lattice shaking techniques are compatible with multiple internal degrees of freedom as we require . </S>",
    "<S> the long - range hopping , which is chosen for theoretical elegance and numerical efficiency , is in fact not essential for the existence of lattice genons as we demonstrate in the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> hence the already realized hofstadter model in optical lattices @xcite can serve as an eminently promising candidate platform for creating genons , while its higher chern bands provide an additional variety of host quantum hall liquids @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a recent realization @xcite based on a quantum gas microscope already allows single - site addressing , and could be combined with holographic beam shaping methods @xcite that provide a natural route towards producing the branch cuts and local potentials necessary to realize lattice genons as we envision . </S>"
