    "significant experimental progresses in the study of semiconductor spin qubits in the past few years@xcite have reconfirmed the confined electron spins as one of the leading candidates for the building block of a solid state quantum information processor .",

    "decoherence of two - spin states in a coupled double quantum dot is crucial to the operation and scale - up of exchange - based spin quantum computer architectures.@xcite since nuclear spins are the main sources of single spin decoherence in gaas quantum dots , where most experimental progress has been made , existing theoretical studies have focused on the decohering effects of the nuclear spins.@xcite in addition , since exchange coupling is electrostatic in nature , exchange - coupled electrons are vulnerable to charge noise and other orbital fluctuations that have an electrical signature.@xcite for example , we have shown how gate noise @xcite and background charge fluctuations@xcite lead to pure dephasing by introducing noise into exchange splitting of a double dot .",
    "electron - phonon interaction is intrinsic to any solid state system,@xcite and semiconductor nanostructures are no exception .",

    "we show that this _ difference _ in electron charge density distribution leads to different dressing by the phonons , without the involvement of the excited states and/or spin - orbit interaction .",

    "is it important ? how do different substrate materials ( gaas and si ) compare to each other ? and how do different qubit architectures compare with each other ?",
    "below we show our results that provide the answers .",
    "let us first examine the dynamical behaviors of the dephasing factors @xmath95 and dephasing rate @xmath105 due to electron - phonon interaction when the double quantum dot is unbiased .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dephasing_nondissipative ] we show the typical behavior of the dephasing factor @xmath95 in the absence of phonon decay for various types of electron - phonon interactions in gaas and si .",
    "there are two interesting features shared by all the curves for acoustic phonons in fig .",
    "[ fig : dephasing_nondissipative ] . at very short times",
    "( @xmath109 ps ) , the increase of @xmath95 is quadratic , which originates from taylor expansion of the @xmath110 factor in the integrand at the small-@xmath111 limit . at long times ,",
    "all the curves saturate , which means that dephasing does not increase with time anymore , so that it corresponds more to a finite loss of contrast than the conventional complete decay of off - diagonal density matrix elements .",
    "the transition between the quadratic increase and the saturation happens between 1 and 10 ps for double dots with a dot separation of 40 nm and a single - dot radius of 20 nm because this time is essentially determined by the interdot distance divided by the speed of sound ( @xmath112 m / s in si and @xmath113 m / s in gaas ) : 40 nm / c @xmath114 10 ps .",
    "the saturation time for si is shorter because si has a larger speed of sound .",
    "the dephasing factor due to dp interaction with ta phonons in si is two orders of magnitude smaller than that due to la phonons , and is not plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dephasing_nondissipative ] .",
    "mathematically , the long - time saturation can be understood by writing @xmath115 as @xmath116 .",
    "since the acoustic phonon spectrum is continuous and nonsingular , the cosine term leads to a vanishing contribution to the integral at large times , which leaves the dephasing factor determined by a constant integral that is independent of time .",
    "physically , this saturation is due to the fact that long - time dephasing is determined by the low - frequency part of the spectrum of the bosonic reservoir , while the phonon density of states vanishes quadratically at low frequency . in other words ,",
    "non - dissipative acoustic phonons simply form an inefficient dephasing reservoir as compared to other charge fluctuation reservoirs such as fluctuating charge traps , which have a @xmath117 spectral density .",
    "this incomplete dephasing has been observed theoretically in a variety of calculations related to phonons , in the studies of general spin - boson decoherence behaviors , charge and spin coherence of single electrons , and exciton coherence.@xcite    for electron interaction with optical phonons in gaas , the dephasing factor @xmath95 takes on a particularly simple form because the optical phonon dispersion at the zone center is flat .",
    "take @xmath118 , we obtain @xmath119 which is a sinusoidal function of time . for a gaas double dot with a single - dot radius of @xmath120",

    "however , the relative magnitudes of the saturated dephasing shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dephasing_nondissipative ] do give a qualitative sense of the relative importance of various types of electron - acoustic - phonon interactions .",
    "specifically , in gaas pe coupling to ta phonons produces the strongest dephasing effect , while in si dp coupling to la phonons is the most important .",
    "in addition , as indicated in eq.([eq : dephasing_ideal ] ) , @xmath95 does have a strong temperature dependence as well . at higher temperatures more acoustic phonon modes contribute to dephasing , so that @xmath95 can eventually become an @xmath126 quantity and dephasing can be considered complete . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dephasing_t ] we plot the temperature dependence of the saturated @xmath95 for gaas and si quantum dots . at temperatures above 1",
    "k dephasing increases with temperature almost linearly . on the other hand , optical phonon induced dephasing",
    "does not have a pronounced temperature dependence even at @xmath127 k because @xmath128 mev is much larger than @xmath129 at low temperatures .",
    "when phonon decay is included , the most important effect is the added exponential dephasing @xmath130 , upon which we will focus in the rest of this study . to calculate @xmath105",
    ", we need to first identify the @xmath3-dependence of the phonon relaxation rate @xmath98 . qualitatively",
    ", lower energy ( lower frequency @xmath10 ) acoustic phonons have to decay slower ( smaller @xmath131 ) .",
    "for example , when phonon decay is due to anharmonicity , or more specifically the third order process of one phonon splitting into two , the phonon decay rate could vary as @xmath132 with @xmath29 between 1 and 4 depending on the lattice symmetry and phonon branches.@xcite in the case of a phonon cavity , it is not clear how the @xmath133-factor would vary with the phonon wave vector , although with @xmath134 [ where @xmath135 is the phonon reservoir density of states ] one could expect @xmath136 . in the following ,",
    "we calculate the acoustic - phonon - induced dephasing rate assuming that @xmath137 , with @xmath29 taking the value of 2 or 3 .",
    "taking @xmath138 for a ta phonon with an energy of @xmath139 mev , we obtain @xmath140 1/s .",
    "for la phonons , which have higher energies than ta phonons with the same @xmath141 , we take @xmath142 1/s .",
    "this is an arbitrary choice that is used to reflect the fact that la phonons generally have shorter lifetimes than ta phonons.@xcite for lo phonons we assume a constant relaxation time of 10 ps for all modes .",
    "the rationale here is that lo phonons have a flat dispersion , so that they should have a near constant relaxation rate near the brillouin zone center .",
    "the lo phonons also have a very short lifetime because of their large energy .",
    "zone center lo phonons have been measured to have a lifetime of 7 ps.@xcite    in fig .",

    "the radius of the single dot electron wave function is 20 nm for this figure and all the following figures .",
    "the strong dependence on @xmath92 for all data sets originates from the fact that the charge distribution difference between the two - electron singlet and triplet states in a symmetric dqd is directly dependent on interdot wave function overlap : @xmath143 ^ 2 $ ] , so that the smaller the overlap , the smaller the difference in charge distribution , and the smaller the phonon - induced dephasing .",
    "based on the data given in fig .",
    "[ fig : dephasing_dissipative_l ] , phonon - induced dephasing is not an important decoherence mechanism when @xmath144 in a symmetric dqd .",
    "an important feature of fig .",
    "[ fig : dephasing_dissipative_l ] is that dp coupling to la phonons is the most important dephasing channel for gaas , and produces about the same magnitude of dephasing in si . in gaas , dephasing due to dp coupling is about one order of magnitude larger than that by po coupling to lo phonons , and almost two orders of magnitude larger than that due to pe coupling to both la and ta phonons .",
    "this fact is somewhat surprising because in fig .",
    "[ fig : dephasing_nondissipative ] it is clear that pe coupling to ta phonons is by far the most important decoherence channel .",
    "however , notice that in the present calculation of @xmath105 the acoustic phonon decay increases rapidly as phonon energy increases , so that the contributions from higher - energy phonons are much more important in the calculation of @xmath105 than in @xmath95 .",
    "this tilt toward higher - energy phonons strongly favors dp coupling over pe couplings because of the factor of @xmath141 difference in the electron - phonon coupling matrix element . the similar values for dephasing for gaas and si within the dp mechanism is more of a coincidence : they have similar values in dp coupling strength , mass density , and speed of sound , and we chose the same @xmath145 for both materials , although si has the extra contribution from the shear dp constant @xmath33 . based on the results presented in this figure , phonon - induced dephasing is an essentially equivalent decoherence mechanism for si and gaas .",
    "another interesting aspects of fig .  [ fig : dephasing_dissipative_l ] is that lo phonons turn out to be a strong source of dephasing for the two - spin states in gaas , even though they have very high energy in gaas ( @xmath114 36 mev ) .",
    "this somewhat surprising result originates from the facts that lo phonons have a diverging density of states at the zone center ( as compared to the vanishing density of states for the acoustic phonons ) and a very fast relaxation rate ( experimentally measured at 7 ps@xcite ) , and that gaas has a reasonably strong polar interaction strength . in si , the conduction electrons do not interact with optical phonons , therefore this decoherence channel is completely removed .    for dp and pe interactions ,",
    "the different @xmath141-dependence of the phonon relaxation rate @xmath98 leads to quite different results in the two - spin dephasing rate @xmath105 . with dp interaction ,",
    "@xmath105 is not very sensitive to the exponent @xmath29 , and increasing @xmath29 in @xmath146 leads to a slight decrease of @xmath105 .",
    "on the other hand , for pe interaction , increasing @xmath29 leads to an approximately three - fold increase of @xmath105 .",

    "[ fig : merit ] , we plot the two - spin merit figure @xmath151 as a function of the interdot distance for double dots in gaas . here",
    "the merit figure is defined as the ratio between a typical exchange gate time given by @xmath152 ( @xmath153 is the exchange splitting ) and the two - spin decay time given by @xmath154 : @xmath155 .",
    "the exchange splitting @xmath153 is calculated within the heitler - london model with a quartic confinement potential @xcite .",
    "the increase of the merit figure at larger inter - dot distance reflects the fact that the exchange splitting and the phonon - induced dephasing have a different dependence on the interdot overlap integral @xmath156 : @xmath157 , while @xmath158 .",
    "the results shown in this figure indicate that for a two - dot exchange gate to operate with a low error rate , a slower operation with a smaller interdot overlap is preferable with regard to phonon - induced dephasing , and fault - tolerant two - qubit operations should be achievable for pretty strongly coupled dots , with @xmath159 .",

    "[ fig : dephasing_dissipative_l ] above indicates that phonon - induced dephasing is about the same order of magnitude in si as in gaas , while exchange coupling should only be somewhat smaller than in gaas .",

    "based on our results presented in this study , phonon induced two - spin dephasing in both symmetric dqd s and biased dqd s can be strongly suppressed by reducing the double - dot tunnel coupling .",
    "the strong overlap dependence of the dephasing rate dictates that phonon - induced dephasing is only important when the double dot is tightly coupled .",
    "dephasing for a biased double dot does increase with bias because of the admixture of the s(02 ) state in the singlet ground state , which introduces electric dipole coupling into phonon - induced decoherence .",
    "therefore , phonon - induced two - spin dephasing is generally stronger in biased dqd s , such as in the case of a singlet - triplet qubit .",
    "phonon - induced two - spin dephasing studied in this paper is related to the different dressing that singlet and triplet electronic states experience through interaction with the phonons . when phonons themselves decohere , this spin dephasing channel leads to true complete decoherence . on the other hand , ensemble average over phonon modes ( while each evolve coherently ) only leads to a finite degree of dephasing .",
    "a legitimate question here is whether this part of the dephasing ( due to phonon population average ) would disappear if we consider dressed electron spin states , especially considering that this finite dephasing generally saturates in the order of 10 ps , much faster than the electron spin initialization and manipulation processes in quantum dots .",
    "mathematically , the answer to this question may very well be `` yes '' , as long as one can identify the energies of the dressed states precisely .",
    "but to answer this question with confidence , one needs to clarify how the energies of the spin states are measured , and how electron - phonon interaction may be incorporated in the description of measurement . in the current generation devices , spin detection",
    "is achieved through charge sensing in the spin - blockade regime,@xcite which is insensitive to phonons , so that the phonon - induced dephasing due to ensemble averaging can not be removed . ultimately , though , this question is moot because phonons do relax and are not coherent forever .",
    "the phonon - induced pure dephasing mechanism we consider here originates from the charge distribution difference between states that have different spatial symmetry , and involves no real or virtual phonon emission or absorption .",
    "it is different from another mechanism of phonon - induced dephasing studied in ref .  , which is based on different level distribution of electron singlet and triplet states and involves virtual emission and absorption of phonons .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied phonon - induced pure dephasing between two - electron singlet and triplet spin states in a semiconductor double quantum dot .",
    "we find that this pure dephasing is important for tightly coupled double dots , but is strongly suppressed when the double dot separation increases , so that at relatively large dot separations ( @xmath144 ) fault - tolerant exchange gates can be realized .",
    "a biased double dot has stronger dephasing compared to a symmetric double dot with the same dot parameters due to the mixing of ( 11 ) and ( 02 ) singlet states and the resulting finite electric - dipole coupling .",
    "we have quantified two - spin dephasing in both gaas and si double dots , finding that deformation potential coupling to la phonons is the most important dephasing mechanism in both materials , and produces about the same magnitude dephasing in both materials .",
    "we also find that the lo phonon makes a non - negligible contribution to dephasing in gaas because of the very fast optical phonon relaxation .",
    "overall , phonon - induced two - spin dephasing is an equivalent decoherence mechanism for si and gaas , is stronger in a biased double dot than in a symmetric double dot , and can be suppressed by reducing the interdot overlap of the electron wave functions .",

    "we can model phonon relaxation by assuming that each phonon mode couples to a continuum of bosonic modes .",
    "this is identical to the description of a cavity photon mode coupling to a continuum.@xcite such a model is grounded in the development of phonon cavities in semiconductor heterostructures,@xcite but more importantly , it presents a clear physical picture about phonon relaxation .",
    "as we discuss below , the exact form of phonon - reservoir interaction does not change the general features of phonon relaxation .",

    "the langevin equation for the phonon annihilation operator ( in the heisenberg picture ) takes the form ( as is obtained in the discussion of cavity photon decay in any number of quantum optics books , e.g. , ref .  ,",
    "14.3 ) @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the slowly varying amplitude of the reservoir bosonic operator .",

    "@xmath3 has been replaced by an integration over energy , with @xmath195 being the density of state for the reservoir , and @xmath190 is assumed to be smooth in any narrow energy range so that it can be replaced by @xmath196 .    in a realistic system",
    ", phonon relaxation often originates from phonon anharmonicity .",
    "the lowest - order anharmonic interaction has each phonon mode coupled to pairs of other modes in the phonon reservoir ( three - phonon processes ) .",
    "we can choose any particular phonon mode as the system and consider its dynamics coupling to the rest of the phonon modes , @xmath197 \\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for simplicity and clarity , we have limited ourselves to normal processes for phonon relaxation.@xcite following the same standard procedure as above,@xcite we first obtain the heisenberg equations for the operator @xmath198 , then formally solve its equation of motion , and finally put the results back into the equation of motion for @xmath198 .",
    "the only significant difference here is that each phonon mode plays both the role of a higher energy phonon relaxing to two lower energy ones , and the role of a lower energy mode to which a higher - energy phonon can decay . keeping only the lowest order contributions , we obtain    @xmath199    where @xmath200 is again the slowly varying amplitude of the phonon operator . in obtaining the langevin equation ( [ eq : langevin2 ] ) for the phonon operator @xmath198 we have assumed that the population of the relevant reservoir phonon modes is not strongly perturbed by the phonon interaction , which allows us to factor out the phonon operators from the time integrals and replace number operator @xmath201 by a constant thermal phonon population number @xmath202 .",
    "notice that the expression for @xmath98 contains two parts .",
    "the first part is due to two - phonon emission and is proportional to @xmath203 , including both spontaneous and stimulated emissions .",
    "the expression is consistent with the population decay rate obtained using fermi s golden rule , which is also proportional to @xmath203.@xcite the second part of @xmath98 is due to the absorption process where the @xmath3-mode phonon and a @xmath204-mode phonon are converted into a higher - energy @xmath205-mode phonon .",
    "this contribution is always positive at thermal equilibrium since @xmath206 .",
    "another interesting feature is that while in the case of cavity phonon decay @xmath98 is only determined by the reservoir density of states and coupling strength [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) ] , here it is also influenced by the thermal occupation of the reservoir phonon modes .",
    "an important result above is that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : langevin2 ] ) and ( [ eq : langevin1 ] ) are of exactly the same form .",
    "this is not really surprising : both coupling to a bosonic reservoir through a cavity mirror and anharmonic interaction with other bosonic modes lead to relaxation , as has been clearly demonstrated in numerous experiments and clarified in many theoretical studies.@xcite we can therefore use eq .",
    "( [ eq : langevin ] ) to describe dissipative phonon dynamics , with appropriately chosen phonon relaxation rate @xmath98 and noise operator @xmath100 .",
    "the effective spin - boson hamiltonian for the two - electron - phonon interaction is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian_eff ] ) : @xmath207 this is a pure dephasing hamiltonian : the interaction with phonons does not change the two - electron eigenstates and there is no relaxation due to phonons .",
    "we derive the phonon induced dephasing following the approach presented in ref .  .",
    "the first step is to obtain the complete phonon langevin equation ( the heisenberg equation in ref .   because phonon relaxation is not considered there ) , which contains both the terms as derived in appendix [ app : langevin ] and a term from the electron - phonon interaction hamiltonian above .",
    "the phonon langevin equation now takes the form @xmath208 where @xmath99 for any particular phonon branch . this differential equation for the phonon operators",
    "can be formally solved .",
    "the solution is      this solution is formal because the noise operator @xmath108 contains a sum over all the phonon operators themselves .",
    "however , when we consider a phonon reservoir that is not driven far away from its equilibrium , which is the case studied in this work , the noise operator would then essentially be a mean field average over all the phonon modes and can be treated as independent from individual phonon mode properties .",
    "therefore , to a good approximation , eq .  ( [ eq : langevin_solution ] ) gives the phonon evolution in the presence of electron - phonon and phonon - phonon or general phonon - reservoir interactions .",
    "the time evolution of the phonon operators allows us to solve for the total density matrix of the electron - phonon system , because the electron - phonon interaction is diagonal ( i.e. pure dephasing spin - boson interaction ) , as discussed in ref .  .",
    "the phonon operators can then be traced out using a coherent - state representation for the phonon modes , assuming an initial thermal equilibrium distribution.@xcite one subtle point in the derivation of the total density operator is that there is a sign difference between the von neumann equation for density operators and the heisenberg equation for regular operators . while one can expand a density operator in terms of regular operators , @xmath210 , the time evolution is reversed : @xmath211 .",
    "thus we need to calculate @xmath212 before calculating the density operator .",
    "it is important to note here that for @xmath212 , the phonon decay term @xmath213 remains a decay term , because @xmath98 comes from a second - order perturbation calculation and is not affected by the change of time direction :      the key difference between the present calculation and the one in ref .",
    "is that here the solution to the phonon operator contains the additional terms for phonon decay and noises .",
    "the decay term is fully integrated in our calculation and leads to the exponential decay of the off - diagonal matrix element of the two - spin density matrix .",
    "the noise term , as we discussed before , represents an overall mean field noise that is independent of individual phonon modes or the electrons . with the assumption that the noise term commutes with the system density operator ( i.e. assuming the noise is classical ) , its effect would be to induce a phase shift in the evolution of the reduced electron density operator but not decay .    99 j.r .",

    "<S> we study electron - phonon interaction induced decoherence between two - electron singlet and triplet states in a semiconductor double quantum dot using a spin - boson model . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the onset and time evolution of this dephasing , and study its dependence on quantum dot parameters such as dot size and double dot separations , as well as the host materials ( gaas and si ) . at the short time </S>",
    "<S> limit , electron - phonon interaction only causes an incomplete initial gaussian decay of the off - diagonal density matrix element in the singlet - triplet hilbert space , a complete long - time exponential decay due to phonon relaxation would eventually dominate over two - spin decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze two - spin decoherence in both symmetric and biased double quantum dots , identifying their difference in electron - phonon coupling and the relevant consequences . </S>"
