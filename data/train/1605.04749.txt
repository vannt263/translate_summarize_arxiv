    "this results in a hamiltonian and consequentially quantum langevin equations that are explicitly periodic in time . solving those is more difficult than stationary ones , since in general solutions contain all multiples of the fundamental frequency .    in this article",

    "this enables us to understand dynamical effects that occur when the drives are not exactly on the sidebands , for example , how squeezing generation can fail or fail to be detected .",
    "we show that there is a special frame in which rotating components become part of the stationary spectrum and can be directly observed .",
    "the method also elucidates how information about the system can be extracted through a second , bichromatically driven `` readout '' mode , an approach used in the experiments reported in ref .",

    "second , we see that in this particular rotating quadrature the optical noise is reduced , which is also a feature of the exact equations of motion ( see minus sign on rhs of [ eq : b solution ] in [ app : full solution ] ) , and @xmath100 is the squeezed quadrature . if @xmath89 and @xmath97 do not have the same phase factor ( for @xmath101 ) , then as time @xmath1 evolves , their relative phase changes , such that sometimes the noises add and at other times they subtract , i.e. , the quadrature we consider rotates relative to the squeezed and antisqueezed quadratures .",
    "third , note that the noises only subtract because both lasers are driving the same mode and thus are subject to the same vacuum fluctuations .",

    "it is only non - zero if @xmath105 . essentially , the mechanical quadratures naturally rotate at the mechanical frequency @xmath16 , so the faster we rotate relative to @xmath16 the quicker we will catch up with the quadrature @xmath106 ahead . the resulting continuous",

    "for details see [ app : weak ] , where we also write down an effective master equation that treats the cavity as an extra bath .    using [ eq : weak aux funs , eq : fourier components ] we write down the components that make up the mechanical spectrum for general detuning @xmath110    @xmath111    integrating over the frequency @xmath112 , we arrive at    @xmath113    and we obtain the variance in the squeezed and antisqueezed quadratures ( which are rotating at the frequency @xmath114 ) @xmath115 where we have defined the detuning of the higher - frequency laser from the upper mechanical sideband as @xmath116 .",
    "term - by - term , the variance contains a reduced ( if @xmath117 ) occupancy due to the extra optical damping , a positive term due to the noise added by the drives , and a term that can be negative due to the aforementioned noise canceling effect of the two drives in one of the quadratures , see [ eq : weakeom1,eq : weakeom2 ] . in the antisqueezed quadrature , the noises add . the optically enhanced damping rate @xmath118 reduces to the one for sideband cooling for @xmath119 .",
    "in that limit the last term on the rhs of [ eq : weak squeezing formula ] vanishes and the two quadratures have equal variances . is then very close to the expected result , apart from the extra noise term @xmath120 , which at this level of approximation does not depend of the detuning @xmath121 .      in [ sec : weak ] we found that the quadrature in which the optical noises cancel most is the one rotating at half the laser frequency difference @xmath114 . with the analytical solution at hand",

    "there is one frame in which it is stationary , whereas in all other frames , the ellipse is rotating , and thus a measurement of the variance will return an average over both quadratures .",
    "note that rotating the ellipse by @xmath141 maps it onto itself , so we can take @xmath142 .",
    "the conclusion is that in order to detect the squeezing we have to follow the quadrature and make the measurement in a special rotating frame . the necessity to `` follow '' the quadrature has been mentioned in the discussion of qnd measurements in ref .",
    "the fact that we need to measure the rotating spectrum components to observe squeezing substantiates the claim that essential information can be hidden in rotating components of spectra . in the literature",
