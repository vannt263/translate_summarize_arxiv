    "the constant @xmath15 in the inequality is in fact optimal if @xmath16 @xcite , and can be seen as a measure of the loss of orthogonality of the eigenfunctions @xmath17 when restricted to @xmath11 .",
    "this inequality has various applications .",
    "it can be used to prove the null - controllability of the heat equation @xcite ( see also the review article @xcite ) , the null - controllability of the thermoelasticity system @xcite , the null - controllability of the thermoelastic plate system @xcite , and the null - controllability of some systems of parabolic pdes @xcite .",
    "it can also be used to estimate the @xmath18-hausdorff measure of the nodal set of finite sums of eigenfunctions of @xmath2 , in the case of an analytic riemannian manifold @xcite , recovering the result of @xcite , that generalizes a result of @xcite for eigenfunctions .",
    "it is quite natural to wish to obtain a similar spectral inequality for higher - order elliptic operators on @xmath12 , along with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the bi - laplace operator , that can be encountered in models originating from elasticity for examples , appears as a natural candidate for such a study .",
    "if the boundary conditions used for the bi - laplace operator precisely make it the square of the laplace operator @xmath2 ( with its boundary conditions ) then the spectral inequality is obvious as the eigenfunctions are the same for the two operators and @xmath19 is an eigenvalue of the bi - laplace operator if and only if @xmath20 is one for the laplace operator . to be clearer ,",

    "it is however often disregarded in the mathematical literature and replaced by the `` hinged '' bi - laplace operator for which analysis can be more direct , in particular for the reasons we put forward above .",
    "the main purpose of the present article is to show that a spectral inequality holds for the `` clamped '' bi - laplace operator and , more generally , to provide some analysis tools to carefully study fourth - order operators that have a product structure .",

    "the subject of the present article is connected to that of unique continuation , in particular through the use of carleman estimates .",
    "moreover , the spectral inequality of theorem  [ theorem : spectral inequality ] is a quantified version of the unique continuation property for finite sums of eigenfunctions .",
    "there is an extensive literature on unique continuation for differential operators ; yet , positive results require assumptions on the operator or on the hypersurface across which unique continuation is pursued . for instance , a simple - root assumption is often made following the work of a.  caldern @xcite or the celebrated strong pseudo - convexity condition is assumed following the work of l.  hrmander @xcite . for second - order elliptic operators ( with smooth complex coefficients ) these assumptions are fulfilled .",

    "an analysis framework is introduced , based on the weyl - hrmander calculus ( @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 18.418.6 ) ) , that allows one to describe the explicit dependency of carleman upon the second large parameter @xmath130 for general classes of operators . that analysis is carried out away from boundaries . here",

    "the introduction of the second large parameter @xmath130 allows us to handle some error terms in the derivation of the carleman estimate in @xmath97 .",

    "this is precisely done by extending some of the work of @xcite and introducing a weyl - hrmander , with three parameters : the large semi - classical parameter @xmath45 , the second large parameter @xmath130 , and this new parameter @xmath139 that controls the convexity of the level sets of the weight function .",
    "note that even in the case @xmath140 , the proof of the carleman estimate relies on taking the second parameter @xmath130 sufficientlylarge ( see the end of proposition  [ prop : microlocal estimate e0 ] below ) .",

    "this analysis follows in part from the different works @xcite .",
    "eventually , the various microlocal estimates we obtain need to be patched together .",
