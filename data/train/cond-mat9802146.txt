    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 wavefunctions of free atoms or ions are , besides kramers ( spin ) degenerate , also 5 and 7-fold orbital degenerate . in crystals",
    "this degeneracy may be lifted by the crystal field ( interactions with the ligands ) .",
    "there are , however , interesting situations where this degeneracy is only partially lifted , so that in a high symmetry situation @xmath0- or @xmath1-levels remain degenerate .",
    "the best known examples are cu@xmath2 ( d@xmath3 ) , mn@xmath4 ( d@xmath5 ) and cr@xmath2 ( d@xmath5 ) in cubic symmetry ( in octahedral surrounding ) . according to the famous jahn - teller theorem  @xcite this degeneracy",
    "should be lifted in the ground state . in a concentrated system",
    "this leads to the phenomenon known as the cooperative jahn - teller effect , or orbital ordering  @xcite .",
    "an interesting aspect of this phenomenon is the strong interplay between the orbital and spin ( magnetic ) ordering .",
    "the orbital occupation determines the character of the magnetic exchange interaction ( the goodenough - kanamori - anderson rules )  @xcite ; and , vice versa , modification of the magnetic structure , e.g. by an external field , may change orbital occupation and lead to a change in the crystal structure  @xcite .",
    "the existence of orbital degrees of freedom , strongly interacting with the spins , does not only determine the orbital and spin structure in the ground state .",
    "it should also have important consequences for the elementary excitations of such systems .",
    "thus , in addition to the collective excitations of the magnetic subsystem -magnons , or spin waves- , also orbital excitations -orbitons- may exist in this case .",
    "this was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite and was studied for a specific model for the manganites in ref .",
    "because of the intimate connection of spin and orbital degrees of freedom , one can also expect strong interaction and possible mixing of these two types of excitations .",
    "this problem was not addressed until now , and it is one of the aims of the present study .",
    "the systems with orbital degeneracy form a rather special class of compounds with very interesting and rich properties . among them are , in particular , many compounds containing cu@xmath2 ( like actually the high t@xmath6 superconductors ) , manganites of the type la@xmath7sr@xmath8mno@xmath9 with a colossal magneto - resistance , but also many other transition metal compounds containing vanadium ( livo@xmath10 , cav@xmath11o@xmath12 )  @xcite , trivalent nickel ( prnio@xmath9 )  @xcite etc .",
    "the study of the elementary excitations in these compounds , besides of being interesting on itself , may shed some light on their unusual properties .    in this work we consider the typical situation of materials containing localized electrons with spin s@xmath13 with doubly degenerate orbitals .",
    "we can describe this situation by the doubly degenerate hubbard model : @xmath14 with @xmath15 in which , besides the usual terms ( electron hopping and on - site coulomb repulsion ) , we also added the on - site ( hund ) exchange interaction .    in realistic situations the hopping matrix elements @xmath16",
    "depend on the type of orbital involved  @xcite .",
    "this leads to enormous technical complications .",
    "as here we are interested in the basic typical features of the excitation spectrum of our system , we treat a simplified symmetric model , assuming @xmath17 keeping only the nearest neighbor hopping for equal orbitals . at the end of the paper we comment which modifications of our results should occur for a more general choice of hopping integrals . in the case of strong interaction",
    "@xmath18 only the degrees of freedom of the localized electrons with spin @xmath19 and the orbitals are left .",
    "consequently we can reduce the electronic model  ( [ eq : ham_general ] ) to a model describing coupled spins and orbitals .",
    "for the doubly degenerate case we can describe the orbital degrees of freedom by an effective pseudo - spin t@xmath13 , so that e.g. an occupied orbital @xmath20 corresponds to t@xmath21 and orbital @xmath22 to t@xmath23 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian has the generic form @xmath24 where for the model with @xmath16 given by  ( [ eq : hop ] ) the exchange constants have definite values  @xcite .",
    "thus for this particular choice of hopping matrix elements the model  ( [ eq : ham_general ] ) reduces to a double - spin heisenberg model .",
    "the characteristic feature of our situation is the existence and strong interplay of spins @xmath25 and @xmath26 which emerges due to the third term of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham_general ] ) .",
    "as we shall see , this interaction leads to a significant mixing of spin and orbital interaction , giving rise , even , to the possibility of the formation of spin - orbiton bound states .",
    "note that the form of the interaction between the spins and orbitals in  ( [ eq : ham_general ] ) is a consequence of the coulomb and hunds rule interaction between electrons and is different from what one expects from simply coupling two heisenberg spin systems . as we want to study the generic features of the coupled spin - orbital system , we consider the general case , treating arbitrary values of the exchange parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "notice that in the general situation with hund s rule exchange included and with realistic values of the hopping integrals @xmath16 the resulting spin - orbital hamiltonian of the type  ( [ eq : hst ] ) can contain terms anisotropic in the @xmath26-operators  @xcite and even terms linear in @xmath26 .",
    "however , even with the more realistic hopping integrals there may exist situations  @xcite in which the symmetry in orbital space remains similar to that of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hst ] ) . for simplicity",
    "we consider such a symmetric double - heisenberg model because , as it turns out , the conditions for the existence of the bound spin - orbital excitations are the most stringent exactly in this case , and if , as we will show , they exist in this case , it will be even more so with the @xmath26-anisotropy taken into account .",
    "if our aim is to calculate the elementary excitations of a system described by the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hst ] ) , we first have to know the ground state wavefunctions .",
    "we can easily calculate a phase diagram within two different approximations : the mean - field and the two - site approximation . in the latter only two interacting spins and pseudo - spins",
    "are considered , so that the ground state is described in a way similar to a valence - bond state , which is a good starting point for low - dimensional spin systems .",
    "starting from ground state wavefunctions obtained within one of these approximations , one can test the stability of the ground state by calculating its response to for instance spin waves and combined orbital- and spin - excitations .      a common method used to gain some understanding of a hamiltonian is a mean field approximation . in our case",
    "it is possible to separate spin and orbital degrees of freedom by replacing operators we want to exclude from our consideration by the averages of their correlation function that appears in the hamiltonian . in this way we generate two mean - field hamiltonians @xmath30 and @xmath31    in hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hs_mf ] ) the orbital degrees of freedom are integrated out and in hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ht_mf ] ) the average over the spin degrees of freedom is taken . in this way",
    "the spin and orbital degrees of freedom are decoupled . after doing the mean - field averaging  @xcite we have , in some sense , thrown away the interesting part of our problem and returned to a renormalized heisenberg model , where the ground state properties and elementary excitations are well known . nevertheless , as in a first approximation it is still a useful approach . the phase diagram in this approximation",
    "is given in figure  [ fig : phases_mf ] .      in a mean - field approximation",
    "the short range interactions are averaged out , and if we want to go beyond this approximation and gain insight into local properties it is more useful to consider a few interacting particles .",
    "this is especially important here because the transformation properties of these terms of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hst ] ) are different , and the more accurate account of the real singlet correlations ( as compared to the mean field , essentially ising - like , treatment ) is essential . to this end case",
    "we consider two spins and two pseudo - spins and obtain the hamiltonian @xmath32 this simple case can be treated exactly , and using these results we obtain the modified phase diagram .",
    "the combinations of ( pseudo-)spin operators can either be singlet or triplet and the ground state energy of the various combinations correspond to the different phases in figure  [ fig : phases_2p ] , for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the character of the first excited state for the various phases for @xmath33 is shown in figure  [ fig : exc_2p ] .",
    "a similar picture can be made for @xmath34 . in spite of the relative simplicity of the hamiltonian , there is a rich variety of ground- and first - excited states , even in the two - site approach .    in the white , central part of this figure the ground state is singlet , both in the spins and orbitals .",
    "the first excited state , however , is not just the change of one singlet into a triplet , but corresponds to the state where both the spins and orbitals are in a triplet configuration .",
    "this is due to the interaction between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom and this very simple example shows that some of the excitations of a system with such an interaction , in this case the lowest one , carry both spin and orbital character .",
    "when @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are chosen in a range where both the spins and pseudo - spins order ferromagnetically , a ferro - ferro phase , we can obtain exact analytical expressions for the elementary excitations . in a ferromagnetic heisenberg model",
    "the exact ground state is the state with all spins pointing in the same direction , as opposed to a heisenberg hamiltonian with an antiferromagnetic exchange where quantum fluctuations affect the nel spin order .",
    "the coupling between the spins and pseudo - spins can lead to the formation of bound states of spin and pseudo - spin excitations .",
    "this is illustrated for the ferro - ferro system in figure  [ fig : sp_orb ] .",
    "let us consider ising spins ( and pseudo - spins ) and examine the energy of an excitation of one spin plus one pseudo - spin .",
    "if the two excited spins are far away from each other , the part of the excitation energy due to the spin pseudo - spin interaction ( the third term in  ( [ eq : hst ] ) ) is @xmath35 . when the excited spins are close to each other , on the nearest neighbor sites or on the same site , this excitation energy is @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "this means that a magnon and an orbiton ( orbital wave ) have an attractive interaction and that in principle , depending on dimensionality and strength of the attraction , the magnon and orbiton can form a bound state .      in order to establish whether it is indeed possible to obtain bound states that are combinations of orbital- and spin waves in the excitation spectrum of the model system , we use the equation of motion method , which provides a simple , and in the ferromagnetic case exact , way to calculate bound state energies . before addressing this issue ,",
    "let us first examine a single ( pseudo-)spin excitations .",
    "starting from hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hst ] ) and with a ground state @xmath38 with energy @xmath39 where all ( pseudo-)spins are aligned in the positive @xmath40 direction , a single spin is excited ( the derivation for single orbital excitations is equivalent ) .",
    "the equation of motion for this excitation is : @xmath41 \\ |0>. \\label{eq : eqm_spin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the evaluation of the commutator and transformation to fourier - space yields the following goldstone modes : @xmath42 where the lattice vectors are denoted by @xmath43 .",
    "the presence of the coupling between the spin and orbital degree of freedom , parameterized by @xmath29 , thus merely renormalizes the spin / orbital wave spectrum .",
    "the equation of motion for a combined spin and pseudo - spin excitation @xmath44 is @xmath45 \\",
    "|0>. \\label{eq : eqm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we find for the fourier transform of the equation of motion @xmath46 with @xmath47 where @xmath0 is the dimensionality of the system .",
    "the total momentum of the excitation is @xmath48 and the relative momentum of the combined spin and pseudo - spin excitation is @xmath49 . in order to check if there is a self - consistent solution of the equation of motion , equation  ( [ eq : f_eqm ] ) is iterated once .",
    "then a set of equations is found that can be represented in a matrix @xmath50 of order @xmath0 for hyper - cubic lattices . in a three - dimensional system @xmath51 .",
    "the set of equations has a solution if , and only if , @xmath52 with @xmath53 if the system is one - dimensional the condition above reduces to @xmath54 where the lattice spacing is set to unity .",
    "this expression resembles the condition for the existence of a two - magnon bound state in a pure ferromagnetic heisenberg model  @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the ferro - ferro phase , i.e. according to figure  [ fig : phases_2p ] , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and determine the bound state energies from condition  ( [ eq : det ] ) and  ( [ eq : bound ] ) .",
    "the integrals appearing in the latter equation are , as in the two - magnon problem , by no means trivial and can only be determined analytically in special cases . in general",
    "these equations can be solved numerically . +",
    "before examining the integrals in detail , let us first turn to the excitations that lie in the continuum .",
    "the continuum of excitations starts at the energy @xmath57 where the denominator of the matrix elements @xmath58 starts to diverge .",
    "the condition for this is : @xmath59 \\label{eq : cont}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the single ( pseudo-)spin wave excitation energy _",
    "always _ lies in the two - particle continuum : @xmath60 the explanation for this is that in a combined spin- and orbital - excitation the momentum is distributed over the two sub - systems and because the excitation spectrum in the ferro - ferro case is non - linear and concave ( @xmath61$]-like ) , the energy of two excitations with smaller momenta can be lower than the energy of one excitation with large momentum .",
    "first we consider the _ one - dimensional _ case .",
    "the integral in equation  ( [ eq : bound_1d ] ) can be reduced to the form @xmath62 which is known analytically .",
    "the condition that the integral be equal to unity is given by the roots of a third order polynomial .",
    "not so much is gained following this procedure , as the resulting expressions are very long and complicated .",
    "so let us consider some special momenta in the brillouin zone .",
    "+ @xmath63 + for @xmath64 the condition  ( [ eq : bound_1d ] ) for a bound state at @xmath65 reduces to : @xmath66 , which is exactly at the phase boundary of the ferro - ferro phase in the two - site phase diagram , figure  [ fig : phases_2p ]",
    ". a bound state at negative @xmath67 appears when @xmath68 .",
    "this simply means that the ground state is not stable ( by exciting it energy is gained ) , which can be expected as the two - site phase diagram shows that the antiferro - antiferro phase is the ground state in this parameter range .",
    "the ferro - ferro ground state is found to be exactly stable in the parameter ranges shown in figure  [ fig : phases_2p ] , indicating that the two - site approximation gives a good prediction for the ground state spin and orbital order , whereas the mean - field solution fails to predict the right ordering .",
    "+    @xmath69 + by treating this special case , we can prove that there is _ always _ a bound state in the ferro - ferro system , at least in one - dimension .",
    "when @xmath70 for all @xmath20 , at the corner of the brillouin zone , the equations simplify considerably .",
    "the off - diagonal matrix elements in equation  ( [ eq : det ] ) vanish so that @xmath71 .",
    "this yields @xmath72 + j_{st } ) , \\label{eq : pi_bound_1d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from these equations follows that @xmath73 for any @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , except when @xmath74 , where @xmath75 .",
    "this proves that at @xmath76 there is always a bound state .",
    "+ at @xmath77 in 1d + for energies approaching the continuum ( @xmath77 ) , the integrand in equation  ( [ eq : bound_1d ] ) , diverges as @xmath78 ( except for @xmath64 ) , making the integral logarithmically divergent .",
    "we can conclude from this that for any @xmath79 ( except for @xmath64 ) there is always a point between @xmath80 where the integral is equal to unity .    from the considerations above we",
    "can conclude that for the one - dimensional system in the range @xmath81 a spin - orbital bound state always exists and that this bound state is the lowest lying elementary excitation of the ferro - ferro phase of model  ( [ eq : hst ] ) .",
    "it is by definition lower in energy than the spin - orbital continuum , which in turn is lower than the single ( pseudo-)spin excitations . before illustrating the statement above with numerical examples ,",
    "let us consider one more special case , namely : + @xmath82 + for these parameters the system is exactly at the phase boundary of the ferro - ferro ground state .",
    "now equation  ( [ eq : bound_1d ] ) takes a particularly simple form , and the solution for the bound state for the one - dimensional system is @xmath83 for the lower bound of the continuum , the single - spin and the single - orbital excitations one obtains in this case @xmath84 in figure  [ fig : bound_sym ] the dispersion relations of these excitations are shown .",
    "the spin - orbital bound state is always the lowest energy excitation of the system .",
    "note that for small @xmath79 the spin - orbital continuum and the bound state are very close in energy and their energy difference is of the order of @xmath85 .",
    "the numerical solution of the bound state equation for a one - dimensional system is shown in figure  [ fig : bound_asym ] for two parameter sets . for small momenta",
    "the bound state is always very close to the two - particle continuum .",
    "when @xmath29 is reduced , the single spin , single orbital and continuum shift down in energy , approaching the bound state energy .",
    "this can be expected since in the case when @xmath86 and @xmath87 the lower bound of the continuum and the single spin and orbital excitation spectra all coincide .    in the right part of figure",
    "[ fig : bound_asym ] a case is shown where the single spin and single orbital excitations have a different dispersion , i.e. @xmath88 . the single orbital excitation is shifted up in energy with respect to the single spin excitation . the bound state , continuum and magnon excitations are close in energy , and in the limit that @xmath89 all three coincide , as can be expected .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bound_2d_sym ] a typical result for a two dimensional system is shown .",
    "it is found numerically that there always exists at least one bound state , also in two dimensions .",
    "similar to the 1d case , the bound state is only well separated from the continuum at the edge of the brillouin - zone . if @xmath90 it can be shown that @xmath91 and @xmath92 so that at these points the bound state is considerably lower than the continuum .      in the sub - sections",
    "above we assumed that the two atomic levels are completely degenerate .",
    "crystal fields generally split the two levels . within the approach above it",
    "is fairly easy to treat this energy splitting .",
    "suppose the energy difference between the orbitals @xmath20 and @xmath22 is @xmath93 .",
    "the hamiltonian to be added to equation  ( [ eq : ham_general ] ) is @xmath94 where the last equality follows from the definition of the t - operators .",
    "the level - splitting manifests itself in the pseudo - spin language as a magnetic field for the orbitals .",
    "carrying through the calculation for the excitations leads to renormalized spin - waves , orbital - waves and bound states : @xmath95    the spin - wave spectrum is not affected , but the `` magnetic field '' for the orbitals causes a gap in the orbital excitation spectrum .",
    "this can be expected since due to the magnetic field there is no breaking of a continuous symmetry in the orbital case , and hence no goldstone mode .",
    "this is reflected in the bound state energy being gapped .",
    "the equalities above permit a convenient generalization of the results derived for the fully degenerate system to the situation where the levels are non- ( or almost- ) degenerate , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : bound_sym_nondeg ] , where the dispersion of the bound state in the case of an orbital energy splitting of @xmath96 is shown .    from the results in this section one can also understand what will be the situation in the general case discussed at the end of the introduction .",
    "namely the orbital part of the effective spin pseudo - spin hamiltonian is in the general case anisotropic , containing both terms of the type  ( [ eq : orb_mag ] ) and ising - like terms @xmath97 .",
    "the situation then will be simular to the one discussed above : there will appear a gap in the orbiton spectrum ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the spin - orbital bound state can still exist below the combined spin - orbital continuum ( but in general above pure spin waves ) and one can show that the conditions for their existence will be even less stringent than in the case of gapless orbitons . however , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : bound_sym_nondeg ] , these bound states will not be the lowest excitations in the system , at least not in the whole brillouin zone .",
    "nevertheless they will lie lower then the orbital waves themselves , and they have definitely to be taken into account in a general treatment of properties of such systems .",
    "note also that the orbital spectrum may still be gapless , even with realistic hopping integrals @xmath98 due to the orbital - lattice symmetry ; this can lead to the particular features of such systems like quantum disorder  @xcite ; the nature of the elementary excitations plays a crucial role in this problem  @xcite .",
    "we studied the low energy excitations of a two - fold degenerate hubbard model in the strong coupling limit with on average one electron per site and symmetric hopping integrals .",
    "we observe that besides the separate spin and orbital excitations , combined excitations ( spin - orbiton bound states ) can exist and can even be the lowest lying elementary excitation of the system",
    ". in general overlap integrals explicitely depend on the symmetry of the orbitals ; this , together with the hund s rule coupling , may break the continuous rotational symmetry of the orbital channel . in this case",
    "one can expect that the eventual spin - orbital bound states , which are gappless in the simplest case , become gapped and may be the lowest lying excitation only at larger momenta .",
    "if not all interactions are ferromagnetic , there is a priori no reason to expect that the orbital and spin - orbital bound states behave qualitatively different from the ferro - case , although the quantum fluctuations might , or might not , destroy long range order  @xcite .",
    "this interesting aspect of the system with antiferromagnetic interactions still deserves further study .",
    "the low energy collective modes of the orbitally degenerate hubbard model certainly contribute to the thermodynamic properties of the system , and should be observable in for instance susceptibility and specific heat measurements",
    ". it should be stressed , however , that the elementary excitations with predominantly orbital character are in general gapped , and therefore lead only to moderate changes in thermodynamic quantities .",
    "experiments that are sensitive to higher energy scales might give direct evidence for the existence of orbitons and spin - orbital bound states .",
    "orbital excitations , however , are strongly coupled to phonons and it might be difficult to distinguish between these two contributions in experiment .",
    "one of the possibilities to pin them down may be connected with the possible anomalies of the phonon dispersion relations induced by the orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "another possibility might be that , since the orbital excitations also couple to the spin degrees of freedom , variations in the spin order , for instance induced by an external magnetic field , will be reflected in the energy and dispersion of the orbital related excitations and consequently in the properties of the phonons mixed with orbitons .    in conclusion",
    ", we studied a model hamiltonian that captures the low energy behavior of a two - fold degenerate hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "we presented the phase diagram in the mean - field limit and in a two - site approach , revealing a rich variety of phases where both the orbital and spin degrees of freedom can be ordered ( anti-)ferromagnetically . we have shown that in this case there may exist , besides usual spin waves ( magnons ) also orbital waves ( orbitons ) and , most interestingly , the combined spin - orbital excitation which can be visualized as bound states of magnons and orbitons . in a fully degenerate system the bound states are found to be the lowest lying elementary excitations , both in one- and two - dimensions .",
    "this shows that the elementary excitations in orbitally degenerate strongly correlated electron systems in general may carry both spin and orbital character .",
