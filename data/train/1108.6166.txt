    "rosenfeld s fundamental measures theory ( fmt ) for additive hard sphere mixtures @xcite has become a cornerstone of classical density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "fmt features in numerous applications to a wide variety of interesting phenomena in liquids @xcite . in additive",
    "hard sphere mixtures the interaction distance between unlike components is taken to be the arithmetic mean of the ( like - species ) diameters .",
    "additive mixtures are often considered as prototypical in the description of liquid mixtures .",
    "nevertheless , non - additivity is a generic feature @xcite that arises very naturally in effective interactions , e.g.  due to the depletion effect @xcite , or when integrating out solvent degrees of freedom in electrolytes @xcite .",
    "a generalization of fmt to binary non - additive hard sphere ( nahs ) mixtures @xcite was based on the scalar version of the additive hard sphere functional @xcite , and has been used successfully in the investigation of bulk @xcite and of interfacial @xcite phenomena that occur in nahs mixtures .",
    "recently significant progress has been made in the formalization of the mathematical structure of fmt .",
    "this includes i ) insights into the geometry of the non - local aspects of the theory , i.e.  the algebraic group structure and symmetry properties of the convolution kernel matrix @xmath0 @xcite , which controls the range of non - locality in the functional . here",
    "@xmath1 is a fixed lengthscale and @xmath2 is the radial distance in three - dimensional space .",
    "formally , @xmath0 is a @xmath3-matrix that is indexed by powers of lengthscale .",
    "its remarkable algebraic properties @xcite allow to view it as an object that is suitable to add or remove a layer of thickness  @xmath1 from a given sphere .",
    "furthermore , ii ) the fmt for additive hard sphere mixtures was obtained from a tensorial - diagrammatic series in density @xcite .",
    "the diagrams possess star - like topology , which is an approximation of the combinatorial complexity of the exact virial expansion . apart from a central space integral ,",
    "all field points are integrations over the density field(s ) , as they are in the exact virial expansion .",
    "the bonds , however , are weight functions rather than mayer functions , and possess only half the range of the ( hard sphere ) mayer function . in one dimension , the result from the series is equal to percus exact functional @xcite . in three dimensions",
    "it gives the kierlik - rosinberg form @xcite of fmt .",
    "the five - dimensional hard hypersphere version is investigated in detail in ref .",
    "comparison to data from the literature for bulk structure and thermodynamics demonstrates the capability of this theory for study bulk and inhomogeneous hypersphere mixtures .    in the present work we generalize the tensorial - diagrammatic series to non - additive hard sphere interactions .",
    "we use the kernel matrix @xmath0 as a further type of bond .",
    "this enables us to represent the binary nahs functional of ref .",
    "@xcite as a series of diagrams that are formed by two stars , one for each species . here",
    "the center of one star is connected to the center of the second star by a @xmath4-bond . formulating an fmt for general ternary non - additive hard sphere mixtures",
    "requires to modify this topology . treating special cases of ternary mixtures that have a suitably high degree of additivity amounts to straightforward generalizations of ref .",
    "this is the case when the cross interaction between ( say ) species 1 and 2 is additive , and the non - additivities between 13 and 23 are coupled in a certain way ( see the discussion below ( [ eqone ] ) ) , and hence can not be chosen independently from each other .",
    "the general case , however requires the introduction of diagrams with different topology . here",
    "three stars , one for each species , are connected to a central three - arm star .",
    "as laid out in detail below , all ( four ) inner junctions are bare space integrals , without multiplication by a one - body density .",
    "only the outer ends carry multiplication by a ( bare ) density variable .",
    "we show that the theory predicts the bulk structure of ternary mixtures , via the ornstein - zernike route , with good quality as compared to monte carlo simulation data .",
    "non - additive hard sphere mixtures possess pair potentials @xmath5 between species  @xmath6 and @xmath7 as a function of the center - center distance @xmath2 of the two particles , that are given as @xmath8 if @xmath9 , and zero otherwise . in the general case all",

    "the unlike components interact at a larger distance than the arithmetic mean of their diameters . for negative non - additivity , @xmath17 ,",
    "the interaction distance is smaller than the mean of the diameters .",
    "while a binary nahs mixture is characterized by either positive or negative non - additivity , in ternary systems mixed cases are possible , where not all of the @xmath18 have the same sign . in ternary nahs mixtures the equation of state @xcite was considered and phase stability was investigated using integral equation theory @xcite .",
    "phase equilibrium was also considered in polydisperse non - additive hard sphere systems @xcite .",
    "in order to construct an fmt for ternary nahs mixtures , we first identify suitable lengthscales .",
    "consistent with rosenfeld s additive case @xcite , we use the particle radii @xmath19 of each species @xmath20 . for the binary mixture @xcite ,",
    "the cross diameter between species 1 and 2 was decomposed as @xmath21 , where the lengthscale @xmath22 accounts for the non - additivity . for the ternary system",
    ", we generalize this to a decomposition of the cross diameters into sums of _ four _ contributions , @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and the three lengthscales @xmath25 , @xmath20 , control the degrees of non - additivity .",

    "this identity , as well as that for the intra - species case above , can be verified by explicit algebra , most conveniently in fourier space , where the convolutions become mere products and algebraic theorems for trigonometric functions can be used to simplify the expressions .      using the four weight functions @xmath62 , we build species - dependent weighted densities @xmath63 in the standard way via convolution with the bare density distribution of the corresponding species , @xmath64 we use the third - rank `` junction '' tensor @xmath65 of ref .  @xcite in order to couple the @xmath63 and",
