    "unstable mass transfer initiates a ce phase , followed by a rapid spiral - in and possibly further evolution on thermal time scales ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "the first ideas were developed by @xcite , but the problem is still far from being understood today .",
    "hence , binary population synthesis codes model ce phases using parametrized prescriptions where the uncertainty of the outcome is dominated by the parametrization of these phases ( compare , e.g. , the study by @xcite for type ia supernova progenitors ) .",
    "as the ce phase does not possess intrinsic symmetries , hydrodynamical simulations in three dimensions are required to model the physical processes .",
    "some processes may take place on a thermal time scale where hydrodynamic simulations are not feasible today and should be complemented by one - dimensional simulations including more physics , e.g. , energy transport ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "recent hydrodynamic simulations include the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) simulations by @xcite and the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) and unigrid simulations by @xcite . in these calculations , the dynamical spiral - in lasts between 10 and 100  d ,",

    ", we have run a high - resolution simulation using the moving - mesh code arepo @xcite .",
    "this code solves the euler equations on a moving computational grid with adaptive resolution , thus combining the advantages of traditional sph and amr codes , e.g. , conservation of angular momentum and total energy and resolution of low - mass flows and small - scale flow features . here",
    ", we show that the arepo code , developed originally for cosmological simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , allows us to resolve the hydrodynamical structure of the ce phase in unprecedented detail . in our simulation ,",
    "shear flows lead to large - scale kelvin - helmholtz instabilities that dominate the flow structure .",
    "these instabilities have not been observed previously in simulations and may mark the onset of convection , thus changing the transport of energy in the envelope on a thermal time scale .",
    "we simulate the dynamical spiral - in of the ce phase with the finite volume hydrodynamics code arepo @xcite .",
    "arepo solves the euler equations on a moving , unstructured voronoi mesh using an hllc - type approximate riemann solver .",
    "self - gravity is included with a tree - based algorithm .",
    "we employ an improved gradient estimate and time integration scheme @xcite yielding second order convergence also for general mesh motions .",
    "individual and adaptive time stepping is used , which boosts the computational efficiency due to the multi - scale nature of the system : not all cells are evolved on the shortest time step , but only the cells requiring the smallest time steps .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were chosen for the hydrodynamics solver with the box size large enough ( @xmath3  cm ) , such that no mass flows over the boundary for a sufficiently long time .",
    "the simulation was stopped when the first outflow reaches the boundary .",
    "the binary system was set up by placing a red giant ( rg ) model on the grid with the core replaced by a gravitation - only particle and then adding another gravitation - only particle to model a non - resolved , compact companion star , e.g. , a main sequence star or a white dwarf .",
    "thus , the simulation consists of cells representing the gas of the envelope and the background ( `` gas cells '' ) and gravitation - only particles representing the rg core and the companion ( `` core cells '' ) .    for preparing the single - star initial conditions",
    ", we followed ohlmann et al .",
    "( 2015 , in prep . ) .",
    "the rg model was created using the stellar evolution code mesa @xcite with a zero - age main sequence mass of @xmath1 . to limit the range in time scales",
    ", we replaced the core of the rg by a particle interacting only gravitationally .",
    "we mapped the resulting model to a grid with mass - adaptive radial shells using a healpix distribution @xcite on each shell .",
    "the gravitational force of the particle was smoothed at a length of @xmath4  cm ( @xmath5 ) according to the spline function given in @xcite .",
    "this enables us to reach a stable configuration around the particle since the pressure gradients can be resolved sufficiently to counteract the gravitational force of the particle .",
    "we treat the gas as an ideal gas with an adiabatic index of 5/3 which is different from the mesa equation of state .",
    "however , since we are interested in the envelope where the departure from ideal gas behaviour is small , this approach still allows for a reasonable representation of the star calculated with mesa in arepo .",
    "the mechanical structure of the star is well reproduced in the envelope ( differences in density , pressure , and sound speed are less than 5% ) . only in the internal energy",
    "we observe larger deviations , because we neglect the ionization state of the gas as a first approximation .",
    "the rg atmosphere was then relaxed by employing an additional damping term to reduce spurious velocities for several dynamical time scales ( for details , see ohlmann et al . , 2015 , in prep . ) .",
    "this resulted in a stable profile with a core mass of @xmath6 and an envelope mass of @xmath7 ( total : @xmath8 ) .",
    "the mach numbers in the envelope reach up to 0.1 after the relaxation procedure , similar to what would be expected from the initial mesa model , although we are not able to properly resolve the convection in the envelope .",
    "the density and pressure profiles are stable for several dynamical time scales after relaxation without applying any damping .",
    "the total number of cells was about @xmath9 with a mean cell mass of @xmath10 at the beginning and @xmath11 with @xmath12 at the end of the simulation due to mesh refinement .",
    "the refinement criterion was set to a target cell mass of @xmath13 .",
    "additionally , in a sphere of five softening lengths of the gravitation - only particle , the maximum cell radius was bound to a tenth of the softening length .",
    "the smallest cells near the rg core have a radius of about @xmath14  cm ( @xmath15 ) at the beginning and about @xmath16  cm ( @xmath17 ) at the end of the simulation .",
    "this allows us to study small - scale flow features in detail . in the direct vicinity of the rg core , the hydrodynamical flow is only resolved outside of a sphere of radius of the softening length",
    "nevertheless , we find that a resolution of about 10 cells per softening length is required to ensure energy conservation during the in - spiral .",
    "the spatial resolution in recent hydrodynamics simulations of ce phases was lower : the amr simulations of @xcite have @xmath18 cells for a @xmath19 rg , the sph simulations of @xcite have @xmath20 smoothing lengths , and the grid simulations of @xcite @xmath21 and @xmath22 cells for a @xmath23 rg .",
    "the companion was placed on the surface of the rg at the same @xmath24 and @xmath25 coordinates as the rg core and at a distance of @xmath26 in the @xmath27 direction .",
    "the mass of the secondary was chosen to be @xmath28 , half of the primary mass .",
    "the velocities were initialized to a rigid rotation around the center of mass with the keplerian rotation period of 23  d. moreover , the envelope was assumed to be in 95% co - rotation , similar to the simulations of @xcite .",
    "more realistic initial conditions would start at the point of roche lobe overflow to take into account the transfer of energy and angular momentum from the orbit to the envelope .",
    "moreover , the hydrostatic equilibrium in the outer layers is less distorted compared to placing the companion at the surface .",
    "however , since the time scales of orbital decay are very long when the first mass transfer starts , it is at the moment computationally infeasible for us to start the simulation at the roche lobe distance .",
    "the rg atmosphere and the companion were placed in a large box with a side length of @xmath3  cm and a low background density .",
    "] of @xmath29  g  @xmath30 . to resolve the gravitational interaction between the cores , the softening lengths of the cores are required to be at most a fifth of the distance between the cores .",
    "the simulation was stopped after about @xmath31  d , when the first low - density tidal arm reached the boundary .",
    "since the box was chosen very large , no mass is lost during the simulation .",
    "angular momentum was conserved to high accuracy during the run with an error below 1% .",
    "-@xmath24 plane up to 80  d. ]    the simulation starts with tidal deformation of the envelope and mass accretion on the secondary .",
    "when the accretion stream hits itself , shocks emerge and the orbit shrinks rapidly by a factor of five during the first revolution ( fig .  [",
    "fig : distance ] ) .",
    "this fast spiral - in slows down after a few orbits and the separation of the rg core and the companion decreases much slower at the end of the simulation . at this point ,",
    "the system evolved for over 80 orbits and the separation is about @xmath32 , a factor of 10 smaller than in the beginning .",
    "the initially circular orbit becomes eccentric ( @xmath33 ) , circularizes somewhat in the course of the spiral - in , and the eccentricity settles at a value of 0.18 .",
    "thus , the orbit is rather eccentric compared to the simulation by @xcite with @xmath34 which may be due to different initial conditions . at the end of the simulation",
    ", the time scale of orbital decay ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 : semi - major axis ) grows to @xmath37  yr .",
    "the energy budget during the simulation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energybudget ] for the gas cells , the rg core and its companion , and the sum of both . in our simulation , the core cells interact only gravitationally , hence , they do not possess internal energy ; thus the total internal energy is given by the gas of the rg envelope only .",
    "although large amounts of potential and kinetic energy are converted into one another ( up to @xmath38  erg in one orbit , i.e.  65% of the total energy ) , the total energy is conserved to better than 3% during the whole run .",
    "this means that our resolution is sufficient to accurately represent the regions where gravity is coupled strongly to the hydrodynamics and where the conversion between potential and kinetic energies takes place .    during the simulation",
    ", energy is transferred from the binary system of the rg core and the companion to the envelope : its binding energy is raised from @xmath39erg in the beginning to @xmath40  erg in the end of the simulation .",
    "this energy is mainly taken from the potential energy of the binary system of the rg core and the companion due to the shrinking orbit .",
    "the internal energy of the envelope decreases by @xmath41  erg because of its expansion .",
    "although the total energy of the envelope is negative at the end of the simulation , @xmath42 of the envelope gets unbound , about 8% of its mass .",
    "most of this material is expelled during the first 40  d. after this , the mass loss rate settles to about @xmath43  yr@xmath44 .",
    "if this mass loss rate is sustained , the envelope may be ejected in roughly 100  yr .",
    "similar to the simulations by @xcite and @xcite , only a small fraction of the envelope is unbound during the fast spiral - in , although more mass is lost in their simulations at a higher rate .    since systems similar to the final system of our simulation are observed ( e.g. , j0755 + 4800 from @xcite ; a @xmath45 + @xmath46 system in a @xmath47 orbit ) , but in a shorter orbit and with the envelope ejected , additional mechanisms must contribute to the evolution that we do not capture in our simulation .",
    "this can either be processes acting on longer time scales ( up to the thermal time scale ) or additional microphysical effects , such as recombination ( compare the sph simulations by @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamics of the spiral - in is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeseries ] as a series of density slices in the @xmath27-@xmath24 plane . during the first orbit ,",
    "the companion plunges into the envelope and an accretion stream onto it builds up .",
    "after 10  d ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timeseries ] , upper left ) , an accretion shock is visible that results in a tidal arm moving outwards .",
    "most of the material that is unbound at the end of the simulation stems from this first interaction . during the second orbit ,",
    "the distance between the rg core and the companion has decreased by a factor of about 5 compared to their initial separation and the two compact components revolve in an eccentric orbit . the shock created by the companion reaches the inner part of the envelope while a second shock is caused by the motion of the rg core .",
    "after about 2 orbits ( 20  d , fig .  [ fig : timeseries ] , upper center ) , the shock created by the rg core overtakes the first tidal arm caused by the companion .",
    "the density field in the regions between the shocks does not show distinct features .",
    "after almost seven orbits ( 40  d , fig .",
    "[ fig : timeseries ] , upper right ) , a layered structure emerges that is created by spiral shocks continuously driven outwards by both the rg core and the compact companion .",
    "shear flows between neighbouring shocks cause kelvin - helmholtz instabilities in the outer part of the spiral structure .",
    "the spiral structure of the shocks tightens and shear instabilities grow stronger at 60  d ( fig .  [ fig : timeseries ] , bottom left ) . at later times ( 90  d , fig .",
    "[ fig : timeseries ] , bottom center ) , shear instabilities of adjacent layers overlap and form a large - scale instability that connects several regions of the spiral structure .",
    "new shocks are still created in the inner part by the rg core and the companion . near the end of the simulation ( 120  d , fig .",
    "[ fig : timeseries ] , bottom right ) , the spiral shock structure is not visible anymore .",
    "instead , large - scale instabilities have emerged and dominate the flow pattern .",
    "the central part of the domain around the compact components is still well resolved ( see inset of the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : timeseries ] ) .",
    "the flow between the rg core and the companion remains smooth ; shocks begin outside the innermost region . during the evolution",
    ", the flow shows some asymmetries caused by the first tidal arm which is ejected in the negative @xmath27 and @xmath24 directions , resulting in a relocation of the rg core and the companion in the opposite direction .        the structure of the envelope at the end of the simulation after 120  d",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : final ] . the density slice in the @xmath27-@xmath24 plane ( fig .",

    "[ fig : final ] ) , the outflow is concentrated mostly around the equatorial plane in a toroidal structure .",
    "shocks generated in the inner part are washed out by the shear instability in the outer region . to assess the convective stability of the envelope",
    ", we employ the solberg - hiland criterion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that predicts convective stability for @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes gravitational acceleration , @xmath50 entropy , @xmath51 specific heat capacity at constant pressure , @xmath52 specific angular momentum , and @xmath53 distance from rotational axis .",
    "this quantity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : final ] for the @xmath27-@xmath24 plane ( upper center ) and the @xmath27-@xmath25 plane ( middle center ) .",
    "the flow is stabilized by the increase of specific angular momentum ( second term ) in a sphere of @xmath54 around the center of mass that is located to the lower left compared to the cores in fig .  [",
    "fig : final ] ( upper center ) . farther away from the center of mass ,",
    "the specific angular momentum is nearly constant , and the impact of the second term in the solberg - hiland criterion decreases rapidly . apart from a small region of stability ( @xmath55 ) around the rg core and the companion , regions of stability and instability alternate over the envelope because of the hydrodynamical flows .",
    "the situation is similar perpendicular to the orbital plane , where unstable regions can be found throughout the toroidal structure .",
    "the growth time scale associated to the unstable regions is @xmath56d ; thus , we conclude that large parts of the envelope should be convectively unstable .",
    "the radial velocity in the orbital plane ( fig .  [ fig : final ] , upper right ) displays some regions with inflows in the left hemisphere but outflows in the rest of the envelope .",
    "the inflow is probably caused by the initial plunge - in of the companion .",
    "the layered structure of the shocks is visible in the inner part as jumps , but it is overlaid by the instability farther out . in the @xmath27-@xmath25 plane the radial velocity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : final ] , middle right ) shows mostly inflows in the upper and left hemispheres and outflows in the lower and right hemispheres .",
    "this pattern is also seen in the vector plot of the velocity in this plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : final ] , lower right ) that additionally shows a complex flow structure with whirls corresponding to the instabilities in the flow .",
    "this complex structure makes it difficult to predict the further evolution of energy transport in this plane . in the region of the developing instability",
    ", the flow is mostly subsonic ( fig .",
    "[ fig : final ] , lower left ) , whereas it is transsonic in most other parts of the envelope and supersonic behind shocks in the outer regions .",
    "the envelope is still mostly co - rotating , as can be seen in the angular component of the velocity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : final ] , lower center ) , although the velocity is rather small in the region of the instability . especially in the inner part",
    ", adjacent layers can be found with differing velocities , resulting in shear flows .",
    "the development of large - scale flow instabilities and an inverse entropy gradient indicate the onset of turbulent convection in the differentially rotating envelope .",
    "this supports the assumptions of @xcite of a co - rotating interior and a differentially rotating envelope with angular momentum transport mediated by convection in the envelope .",
    "large - scale flow instabilities have not been observed in hydrodynamics simulations before .",
    "@xcite show a density distribution for their 256@xmath57 grid run after about 5 orbits , where only spiral shocks with smooth regions in between are visible ( see their figure  6 ) .",
    "the density slice of the amr simulations by @xcite after roughly 5 orbits displays features that may be caused by shear flows between adjacent spiral shocks .",
    "their simulation was stopped at this instant and it is unclear if large - scale instabilities would have emerged in the further evolution of the model .",
    "we suspect , however , that the development of shear instabilities is not seen due to large numerical diffusion in the sph simulations and due to the background velocity field in the grid simulations .",
    "the violation of galilean invariance in conventional grid - based hydrodynamics codes ( when altering the background velocity at the same resolution ) suppresses kelvin - helmholtz instabilities on a static mesh ; this is illustrated in figure  33 of @xcite .",
    "the numerical scheme of arepo is galilean invariant , thus , shear instabilities may also develop on top of background velocities .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we explore the hydrodynamics of the rapid spiral - in during a ce event using the moving - mesh code arepo .",
    "the combination of the nearly lagrangian mesh motion and the galilean - invariant scheme enables us to resolve the hydrodynamical structure in unprecedented detail , and complements recent hydrodynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "in particular , we observe , for the first time , the emergence of large - scale flow instabilities .",
    "these are caused by shear between adjacent layers of the shock spiral that is created by the in - fall of the companion .",
    "these instabilities indicate the onset of turbulent convection , with important consequences for the further evolution of the system by , e.g. , altering the energy transport on thermal time scales .    in terms of global quantities , we confirm earlier simulations @xcite : only a small fraction of the envelope mass is ejected on a dynamical timescale and the final separation is larger than observed .",
    "this may be due to the envelope ejection proceeding on a much longer time scale than that followed in our simulation .",
    "it is also possible that we miss other processes driving the loss of the envelope , such as recombination .    as a next step",
    ", we will improve the modeling of additional microphysical effects , including recombination , and examine different parameters ( orbital parameters , masses ) to link the final system characteristics to them in a systematic way .",
    "this opens up the exciting prospect to directly connect the hydrodynamics simulations to binary stellar evolution ."
