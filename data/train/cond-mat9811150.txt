    "<S> polydisperse mixtures are those in which components with a whole range of sizes are present . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the fluid phase of polydisperse hard spheres is thermodynamically unstable unless the density of large spheres decreases at least exponentially as their size increases . </S>",
    "<S> the instability is with respect to the large spheres crystallising out into multiple solid phases .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs : 64.10.+h , 64.75.+g , 82.70.kj    2    mixtures of hard spheres in which spheres with a wide range of diameters are present are a good first model of emulsions . </S>",
    "<S> emulsions are suspensions of droplets of oil or fat in water ; milk is perhaps the most familiar example </S>",
    "<S> . the droplets of an emulsion interact via a short ranged repulsion , which is well represented by a hard - sphere interaction . </S>",
    "<S> they are typically present with a wide range of diameters : from 0.1 to a few micrometers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mixtures in which a continuous range of sizes are present are termed polydisperse @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are much less well understood than systems which contain only one or two components . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the phase behaviour of single component hard spheres @xcite has been understood for thirty years : the fluid phase is stable up the point where the spheres occupy a little less than half the volume of the suspension , there is then a first order transition to a solid . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast there are no phase diagrams known for polydisperse hard spheres . </S>",
    "<S> below , we examine polydisperse spheres with particular emphasis on the largest spheres . we show that unless their density decreases at least exponentially with increasing size , they crystallise out of the mixture at all densities . </S>",
    "<S> the mixture is then never stable as a single fluid phase . </S>",
    "<S> the crystallisation is driven by a depletion attraction @xcite between the large spheres , due to the smaller spheres . </S>",
    "<S> depletion - induced separation of the largest spheres has been observed in emulsions @xcite but there the floating of the droplets to the surface due to gravity complicates the situation . </S>",
    "<S> our demonstration applies to spheres at equilibrium .    </S>",
    "<S> specifying a polydisperse mixture requires specifying the number density of spheres of every size . </S>",
    "<S> this is done with a distribution function @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the number density of spheres with diameter @xmath1 is then @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the total number density of spheres . </S>",
    "<S> although our final result will apply to a whole class of distribution functions we choose a specific function for definiteness and because it is widely used to describe emulsions @xcite and powders @xcite . the distribution is called the log - normal distribution , and it is defined by @xmath4 ^ 2 } { 2\\ln(1+w^2 ) } \\right ) , \\label{distf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the mean diameter and @xmath6 is the standard deviation in units of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> note that for this distribution there is no upper limit on @xmath6 ; its lower limit is zero and corresponds to a one component system . in the canonical ensemble a polydisperse mixture of hard spheres </S>",
    "<S> is completely specified by @xmath0 and the total number density of spheres @xmath3 ; for hard spheres the temperature is not a relevant variable .    in order to make progress in understanding a polydisperse mixture of hard spheres with a broad distribution of sizes we distinguish between the spheres with diameters close to or less than the average diameter @xmath5 and spheres with much greater diameters . due to the large differences in size and number density of these two sets of spheres we will treat them differently . not only is the number density of the large spheres much less than that of the spheres with diameters near @xmath5 but the fraction of the fluid s volume they occupy is much less . </S>",
    "<S> this is so because @xmath0 , eq . ( [ distf ] ) , decays much faster than @xmath7 at large @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the very large spheres of the distribution , those with diameters @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> these spheres are immersed in a ` sea ' of spheres much smaller than themselves , for each large sphere there are many spheres with diameters of the same order as @xmath9 or smaller . </S>",
    "<S> these smaller spheres induce an effective attraction between the large spheres of the polydisperse mixture : the well - known depletion attraction first described by asakura and oosawa @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect has been extensively studied both theoretically @xcite and in experiments on colloids which accurately model ( polydisperse ) hard spheres @xcite .    the depletion attraction is entropic in origin ( it can not have any other origin as in hard spheres there is no energy of interaction and so there is nothing but entropy ) . </S>",
    "<S> when two spheres approach each other then the volumes they exclude to the other spheres overlap . </S>",
    "<S> thus the volume this pair of spheres denies to the other spheres decreases and so the volume available to the other spheres increases , increasing their entropy . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly pronounced for a pair of large spheres surrounded by many small spheres , then when the large spheres touch the entropy of very many small spheres increases .    for a pair of spheres of diameter @xmath1 immersed in an ideal gas of spheres all of diameter @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> the range of the depletion attraction is @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the attraction increases from zero when the surfaces of the large spheres are @xmath12 apart to a maximum when the large spheres touch . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the effective attraction can be measured by its value at contact divided by the thermal energy @xmath13 , @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the increase in the entropy of the small spheres of size @xmath12 when a widely separated pair of spheres of size @xmath1 is brought into contact with each other . </S>",
    "<S> it is given by @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the density of the small spheres . </S>",
    "<S> each large sphere excludes the smaller spheres from a spherical volume of diameter @xmath11 , shown in fig . 1 by the thick lines around the spheres . when two large spheres are touching , the two volumes which they exclude to the small spheres overlap . </S>",
    "<S> the volume of overlap of these two volumes is @xmath17 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 we see that this volume is equal to that of two caps , each an end of a sphere of diameter @xmath11 and of height @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we are considering the limit of small @xmath19 and so the caps are very flat . </S>",
    "<S> then the height of one of the caps a distance @xmath20 from a line drawn between the centres of the two large spheres is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the radius of a cap at its base ; @xmath23 . the total volume of the two caps @xmath24    now , for polydisperse spheres distributed according to eq . ( [ distf ] ) </S>",
    "<S> the number density of spheres with diameter @xmath12 is @xmath25 and so for a pair of spheres of diameter @xmath26 the depletion attraction due to spheres with diameters @xmath27 is @xmath28 which depends on the cutoff @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> however , if @xmath1 is sufficiently large that @xmath30 then the integral depends only weakly on @xmath29 because @xmath31 is small for values of @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed we can extend the upper limit of integration to infinity without introducing a significant error . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that we can do so justifies our splitting of the distribution into two parts . </S>",
    "<S> then we have @xmath33 where we have used the relation @xmath34 which holds when @xmath0 is given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ distf ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the physical content of this approximation is that very large spheres only notice spheres with diameters around @xmath9 and less ; the density of the larger spheres is too small to add significantly to the depletion effect . </S>",
    "<S> note that the attraction increases linearly with the size of the spheres @xmath1 .    by using the idea of a depletion attraction </S>",
    "<S> we have reduced our polydisperse mixture to the large @xmath1 tail of the distribution interacting via an effective interaction which is the sum of a hard - core interaction plus the short ranged attraction of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ depl2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the attraction of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ depl2 ] ) favours condensed phases where the large spheres are within the range of the attraction of each other . competing against this attraction is the translational entropy of the large spheres , which favours dilute phases . </S>",
    "<S> this competition is the same as that involved in the vapour - liquid transition of a simple substance such as argon . </S>",
    "<S> the translational entropy of the large spheres is just that of an ideal gas mixture , so per large sphere of size @xmath1 it is @xcite @xmath35\\\\ & \\sim & \\mbox{const.}- \\ln(\\rho/{\\overline\\sigma})\\nonumber\\\\ & & -(3/2)\\ln(\\sigma/{\\overline \\sigma } ) + \\frac{\\left[\\ln(\\sigma/{\\overline \\sigma})\\right]^2 } { 2\\ln(1+w^2 ) } , \\label{sf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second expression is obtained by substituting eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ distf ] ) in the first and the constant is a function only of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy @xmath36 increases with sphere size @xmath1 because the density decreases . </S>",
    "<S> but it only increases as the square of a log , which is a slower than linear increase .    </S>",
    "<S> the stability of the dilute fluid phase with respect to condensation into a phase in which the density of large spheres is much higher , is determined by the relative entropy of the dilute and condensed phases . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we require the entropy of the condensed phase . </S>",
    "<S> the range of the depletion attraction is @xmath37 . for spheres of diameter @xmath8 , </S>",
    "<S> this is very small in comparison to the size of the sphere , @xmath1 . in the @xmath38 limit </S>",
    "<S> , the ratio of the range of the attraction to the size of the sphere , @xmath39 , tends to zero . </S>",
    "<S> this is the sticky - sphere limit introduced by baxter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the large spheres are all near this sticky - sphere limit and as @xmath1 diverges the spheres tend towards the limit . </S>",
    "<S> stell has shown @xcite that as the strength of the attractions is increased , a fluid of sticky spheres does not condense to form a liquid but collapses to form a close - packed solid , see also refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so , we look not for condensing of the large spheres into a dense , liquid - like , phase but for collapse into a dense solid . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore require the entropy in the dense solid phase . by dense we mean sufficiently close to the close packed density that the sphere is within the range of the depletion attraction of its neighbours .    </S>",
    "<S> the entropy per large sphere , @xmath40 of a dense solid phase has two parts . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the entropy associated with the motion of the large sphere , and the second is the entropy gain of the small spheres when a large sphere is brought close to twelve neighbouring spheres , as it is in a dense face - centred - cubic or hexagonal - close - packed lattice . the first part is easily obtained from a cell theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this assumes that each sphere is restricted to a cage formed by its neighbours , which are taken to be fixed at their lattice positions . for a solid with a lattice constant @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> , the centre of mass of a sphere can move a distance @xmath42 from its lattice position without bumping into any of its neighbours . </S>",
    "<S> the solid is formed due to attractive interactions so the spheres must be close enough to each other to attract each other throughout the cage which its neighbours form . </S>",
    "<S> for this to be true @xmath41 must satisfy @xmath43 , and so @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a parameter in the range @xmath46 . for monodisperse spheres the entropy is simply the logarithm of the volume @xmath47 , which is available to the centre of mass of a sphere @xcite .    when the spheres are polydisperse the situation is more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> there is an upper limit to the range of sizes of spheres a single solid phase can tolerate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a lattice can only accommodate spheres up to about its lattice constant @xmath41 in diameter ; larger spheres can not fit into the lattice position without overlapping with their neighbours . </S>",
    "<S> spheres with diameters less than @xmath48 are so small that they can not be within the range of the depletion attraction of all their neighbours @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the large spheres can not all crystallise into a single solid phase . in order to crystallise </S>",
    "<S> they first fractionate into many fractions , each containing spheres with only a narrow range of diameters . </S>",
    "<S> the fractions can then crystallise individually to produce separate solid phases , each containing spheres of a different size . </S>",
    "<S> the combined fractionation - and - crystallisation of polydisperse sticky spheres is discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the range of diameters is roughly @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> this width of distribution contributes an amount @xmath50 to the entropy of the solid @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath45 will be determined by a competition between the depletion attraction tending to reduce it and the motion of the large sphere which tends to increase it . </S>",
    "<S> however , our results are not sensitive to the exact value of @xmath45 and so we merely take it to be much less than one . </S>",
    "<S> then the depletion attraction is almost equal to its value at contact , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ depl2 ] ) , and the gain in entropy of the small spheres per large sphere which solidifies is closely equal to minus six times eq . ( [ depl2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , the entropy per large sphere of a solid phase of large spheres of size @xmath1 @xmath51      very recently , cuesta @xcite has shown that within the boublik - mansoori - carnahan - starling - leland ( bmcsl ) @xcite approximation polydisperse hard spheres with a log - normal distribution with a sufficiently large standard deviation @xmath6 have a spinodal . </S>",
    "<S> warren has also found a spinodal within the bmcsl approximation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a spinodal is where the fluid phase becomes unstable with respect to an infinitesimal density and composition fluctuation . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between cuesta s result and ours is probably due to one or both of two factors . </S>",
    "<S> the first factor is the nature of the transition we have found . </S>",
    "<S> it is very strongly first order and so the transition occurs much before the spinodal . </S>",
    "<S> the second factor is the accuracy of the bmcsl approximation </S>",
    "<S> . it may be poor when there are spheres of widely different sizes present @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in comparing our result with experiment it should be remembered that in an emulsion there will be some upper size limit , beyond which there are essentially no particles . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the number of phases which separate out is then not infinite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , at sufficiently low volume fractions the fluid phase of the emulsion will be stable . </S>",
    "<S> the fluid phase can be destabilised by adding small spheres to the distribution , so increasing the strength of the depletion attraction . </S>",
    "<S> for emulsions , micelles can be added and indeed this is done in bibette s @xcite procedure for fractionating emulsions .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarise , polydisperse hard spheres with a non - zero volume fraction and distributed according to a distribution function which decays more slowly than exponentially are thermodynamically unstable . </S>",
    "<S> spheres above some lower size limit crystallise due to the depletion attraction induced between them by the presence of the smaller spheres of the distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we have not determined this lower limit but it is much larger than the average size @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid phase can only tolerate a very limited polydispersity @xcite and the range of spheres which crystallise is from this lower limit to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the number of solid phases which form is infinite . </S>",
    "<S> this seems surprising at first but in the large @xmath1 tail of the distribution the depletion attraction is increasing more rapidly than the translational entropy in the fluid phase and so there is no upper limit to the sizes of spheres which crystallise . </S>",
    "<S> the lower limit to the sizes of spheres which crystallise is clearly finite as a solid phase will form so long as it reduces the entropy by any non - zero amount . </S>",
    "<S> the sub - linear increase with @xmath1 of the translational entropy in the fluid is the crucial factor in destabilising the fluid phase . </S>",
    "<S> it inevitably leads to the fluid being unstable when the attractions grow linearly with sphere diameter .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we conjecture that the instability we have found is not restricted to spheres or to attractions which arise from depletion . consider a general polydisperse fluid with a number density @xmath56 of elements of size @xmath57 then the translational entropy increases as minus the logarithm of @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> if the attractive energy ( over @xmath13 ) @xmath59 between elements increases faster than @xmath60 @xmath61 then the attractive energy is much larger than the translational entropy for sufficiently large @xmath57 . when this is true we expect the mixture to be unstable with respect to the largest elements condensing out to form a dense phase in order to minimise the energy .    </S>",
