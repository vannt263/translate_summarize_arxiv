    "as the age of regions estimated is much shorter than the arm crossing time ( @xmath141 , ) , the regions must have been born within the associated `` whii '' gmcs on site .",
    "the relatively young age of the regions compared to @xmath125 gives us another important implication ; if the `` wohii '' gmcs are able to initiate massive star formation , we should see the symptoms of massive star formation inside the `` wohii '' gmcs .",
    "nevertheless , little 8@xmath48 m emission could be seen in the `` wohii '' gmcs .",
    "this implies that there must be a condition for massive star formation , which is fulfilled by the `` whii '' gmcs but not by the `` wohii '' gmcs .",
    "+  as we have seen in section [ sec : evolutionofgmcinthespiralarm ] , collisional coagulation of clouds seems to be responsible for the evolution of the gmcs .",
    "one of the possible mechanism for initiating massive star formation is cloud  cloud collision @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "molecular clouds are compressed by the shock at the colliding surface and subsequently dense cores are formed @xcite . however , at the center of the gma where large velocity gradient due to streaming motions is observed and enhanced rate of collision is expected , little or no sign of star formation is seen .",
    "this implies that for the onset of massive star formation , not only cloud collision but also some other conditions may be required .",
    "another interpretation as following might arise .",
    "namely , after star formation is initiated inside the `` wohii '' clouds , star formation proceeds rather slowly and become only visible at the `` whii '' clouds .",
    "however , this requires slow progress of star formation , with a timescale comparable to the arm - crossing time mentioned above . even if this is the case , the progress of the star formation shall be regulated by the evolution of gmcs because of the far longer timescale of arm - crossing time compared to dynamical timescale in each gmc ( @xmath142yr , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "both interpretations requires the evolution of the cloud properties which enable triggering of star formation to work effectively .",
    "+  figure [ fig : a12_alpha_flux ] shows a scatter plot of the area - averaged 8@xmath48 m luminosity measured within each cloud boundary and the virial parameter @xmath114 for each cloud .",
    "there is a tendency that 8@xmath48 m luminosity , which is proportional to the star formation rate , is higher in the range of @xmath143 compared to in the range of @xmath144 .",
    "it was shown in section [ sec : virial parameter ] that the degree of binding of the gmcs is mainly determined by its line width .",
    "these facts suggest that virialization of gmc achieved by the dissipation of turbulent motion is one of the necessary conditions for the onset of massive star formation .",
    "+  recent studies emphasize the importance of turbulence in both regulating and the triggering star formation .",
    "in the theory of turbulence regulated star formation , although dense cores are formed by the shock driven by supersonic turbulence inside a gmc ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , limited part of the gmc can be dense enough to form cloud cores since the greater part of the gmc are supported by the excess kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented semianalytical calculation using the theory and showed that amount of the excess kinetic energy inside the gmc , which is proportional to @xmath114 , controls the production rate of cloud cores , and thus star formation rate .",
    "this point is in agreement with our results that dissipation of turbulence is required for the onset of massive star formation .",
    "after gmcs have dissipated excess kinetic energy , it can initiate star formation , whatever the trigger may be .",
    "results of the full aperture observations of the northeastern spiral arm segments of in @xmath0co ( 10 ) and @xmath1co ( 10 ) made with a spatial resolution of @xmath2 50 pc were presented . though the spatial resolution of the observations is not high enough to resolve internal structure of gmcs , it is capable of investigating the global property of massive gmcs .",
    "the observations cover the 1kpc @xmath3 1.5kpc region which contain a gma with mass of @xmath145 @xmath6 , where spatial offsets between @xmath0co and star - forming regions exist .",
    "the nma data were combined with the 45 m telescope data to image the extended co distribution and investigate whether and how the properties of molecular clouds change by crossing the spiral arm . the results are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "the spiral arms were resolved into a number of clouds which have size , temperature , and surface mass density comparable to the massive gmcs in the galaxy . while the @xmath0co ( 10 ) distribution is concentrated in a narrow ridge in the southern half of the observation field ,",
    "it is more smoothly distributed in the northern half , where the gma exists .",
    "comparison with the @xmath1co ( 10 ) image showed that at the center of the gma only little @xmath1co ( 10 ) emission is detected despite of its strong @xmath0co emission .",
    "2 .   comparison with star formation tracers indicated that while some of the clouds are closely associated with star forming regions , the rest of the clouds show little or no sign of massive star formation .",
    "the identified clouds were divided into two categories according to whether they are associated with star formation activity or not .",
    "twenty - sixclouds with masses of ( @xmath146@xmath147 ) @xmath3 @xmath148 @xmath6 were identified from the @xmath0co ( 10 ) data cube .",
    "the size and the line width of the clouds were comparable to gmcs in the milky way .",
    "the identified clouds also followed the linewidth ",
    "size relation and the mass  linewidth relation of the galactic gmcs , suggesting that the identified clouds are resemblance of galactic gmcs .",
    "the identified clouds ( gmcs ) were divided into two categories according to whether they are associated with star - forming regions or not .",
    "comparison between both categories showed that clouds which are associated with star - forming regions ( `` whii '' gmcs ) are more virialized and massive compared to the clouds which show little or no sign of star formation ( `` wohii '' gmcs ) .",
    "moreover , the `` wohii '' gmcs have larger line width compared to the `` whii gmcs '' . as the `` whii '' gmcs",
    "are located downstream of the `` wohii '' gmcs , it is concluded that properties of the gmcs do change by crossing the spiral arm .",
    "the line ratio , @xmath93 , varies from @xmath149 in the center of the gma where little or no sign of star formation is seen to @xmath150 in the discrete gmcs which are associated with regions .",
    "on the whole , the `` wohii '' gmcs likely show a low @xmath93 value which suggests a larger fraction of diffuse molecular cloud components than the `` whii '' gmcs .",
    "6 .   to see what parameter of the gmc controls degree of gravitational boundness of the gmc , correlation plots between the virial parameter , @xmath151 , and other basic gmc properties , namely , radius , line width , and mass were made .",
    "the linewidth@xmath114 plot indicated most strong correlation implying that the dissipation of turbulent motion controls the boundness of the gmcs .",
    "random coagulation of the pre - existing small clouds can explain the growth of the mass and the timescale involved in the change .",
    "collisional coalescence involved in random coagulation may also explain the observed decrease of line width , as the kinetic energy of the clouds will be dissipated by inelastic cloud collision .",
    "the closeness of regions and the `` whii '' gmcs imply that those gmcs are real progenitors of the associated regions .",
    "the rough estimate of the age of regions gives @xmath2 5 myr , which is well below the arm - crossing time .",
    "this implies if the `` wohii '' gmcs are able to initiate star formation , the symptoms should have seen .",
    "so , the sparseness of star formation in the `` wohii '' gmcs suggests they do not meet the condition for massive star formation .",
    "+ plot of area - averaged 8@xmath48 m luminosity and virial parameter ( @xmath114 ) shows a tendency that the 8@xmath48 m luminosity , which is proportional to the star formation rate , rises in the range of @xmath143 .",
    "this might imply that dissipation of turbulence controls not only the evolution of gmcs , but also the probability of massive star formation .",
    "the authors would like to thank the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) staff for operating the nma and the 45 m telescope .",
