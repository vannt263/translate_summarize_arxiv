    "we describe a new project to bring together the communities of _ * * s**ymbolic * * c**omputation _ and _ * * s**atisfiability * * c**hecking _ into a new joint community , .",
    "both communities have long histories , as illustrated by the tool development timeline in figure [ fig : tools ] , but traditionally they do not interact much even though they are now individually addressing similar problems in non - linear algebra . in section  [ sec : sat ] we give an introduction to _ satisfiability checking _ ( a corresponding introduction to symbolic computation is omitted given the audience for this abstract ) .",
    "we then discuss some of the challenges for the new community in section  [ sec : challenges ] and the project actions planned to address them .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for more details and full references ; and the website ( http://www.sc-square.org ) for new information as it occurs .",
    "the accompanying poster is available at : http://www.sc-square.org/sc2-announcementposter.pdf .    -10pt",

    "the _ sat problem _ refers to checking the satisfiability of logical statements over the booleans .",
    "initial ideas from davis and putnam in 1960 used _ resolution _ for quantifier elimination ; davis , logemann and loveland pursued another line in 1962 with a combination of _ enumeration _ and _ boolean constraint propagation ( bcp)_. a major improvement was achieved in 1999 by marques - silva and sakallah by _ combining _ the two approaches , leading to _ conflict - driven clause - learning _ and _ non - chronological backtracking_. while the sat problem is known to be np - complete , sat solvers have been developed which can handle inputs with millions of boolean variables .",
    "they are at the heart of industrial techniques for verification and security .",
    "driven by this success , big efforts were made to enrich propositional sat - solving for different existentially quantified theories producing _ sat - modulo - theories ( smt ) solvers _ @xcite .",
    "there exist techniques for equality logic with uninterpreted functions , array theory , bit - vector arithmetic and quantifier - free linear real and integer arithmetic ; but the development for quantifier - free non - linear real and integer arithmetic is still in its infancy .",
    "progress here is required for applications in the automotive and avionic industries @xcite .",
    "smt solvers typically combine a _ sat solver _ with one or more _ theory solvers _ as illustrated in figure  [ fig : smt ] .",
    "a formula in conjunctive normal form is abstracted to one of pure boolean propositional logic by replacing each theory constraint by a fresh proposition .",
    "the sat solver tries to find solutions for this , consulting the theory solver(s ) to check the consistency of constraints . to be _ smt - compliant _",
    "the solvers should :    work _ incrementally _ , i.e. accept additional constraints and re - check making use of previous results ;    support _ backtracking _ ,",
    "i.e. the removal of previously added constraints ;    in case of unsatisfiability return an _ explanation _ , e.g. a small inconsistent subset of constraints .    -10pt",
    "[ fig : smt ]    examples for solvers that are able to cope with linear arithmetic problems are ` alt - ergo ` , ` cvc4 ` , ` isat3 ` , ` mathsat ` , ` opensmt2 ` , ` smt - rat ` , ` verit ` , ` yices2 ` , and ` z3 ` . far fewer tools exist for non - linear arithmetic : ` isat3`uses interval constraint propagation ; ` minismt`tries to reduce problems to linear real arithmetic ; ` z3`uses an adaptation of the cylindrical algebraic decomposition ( cad ) method ; while ` smt - rat`uses solver modules for cad , virtual substitution , grbner bases , interval constraint propagation and branch - and - bound .",
    "even fewer smt solvers are available for non - linear integer arithmetic ( undecidable in general ) .",
    "smt solving has its strength in efficient techniques for exploring boolean structures , learning , combining techniques , and developing dedicated heuristics .",
    "symbolic computation is strong in providing powerful procedures for sets of arithmetic constraints , and has expertise in simplification and preprocessing .    to allow further exploitation by the satisfiability checking community , symbolic computation tools",
    "must first be adapted to comply with smt requirements ( cad , grbner bases and virtual substitution are algorithms of particular interest ) . however",
    ", this is a challenge that requires the expertise of computer algebra developers .",
    "conversely , symbolic computation could profit from exploiting successful smt ideas , like dedicated data structures , sophisticated heuristics , effective learning techniques , and approaches for instrumentality and explanation generation .",
    "incremental cad procedures now exist , as do prototypes integrating cdcl - style learning techniques with virtual substitution for linear quantifier elimination .",
    "we aim to create a new research community whose members will ultimately be well informed about both fields , and thus able to combine knowledge and techniques to resolve problems ( academic and industrial ) currently beyond the scope of either individually . to achieve this an eu horizon 2020 _ coordination and support action _ ( 712689 ) project started in july 2016 .",
    "we plan the following actions :    * communication platforms : * like symbolic computation , satisfiability checking is supported by its own conferences ( e.g. cade , ijcar , smt ) and journals ( e.g. jar ) ; while a role somewhat analogous to sigsam is played by the satlive forum ( http://www.satlive.org/ ) .",
    "we have started to initiate joint meetings : in 2015 a dagstuhl seminar was dedicated to ; at aca 2016 and casc 2016 there will be topical sessions ; and the first annual workshop will take place in affiliation with synasc 2016 .    *",
    "research roadmap : * the above platforms will initiate cross - community interactions .",
    "our long - term objective is to create a research roadmap of opportunities and challenges ; identifying within the problems currently faced in industry , points that can be expected to be solved by the community .",
    "* standards * we aim to create a standard problem specification language for the community , extending the _ smt - lib_language to handle features needed for symbolic computation .",
    "this could serve as a communication protocol for platforms that mix tools ; and will be used to develop a set of benchmarks .",
