    "we have also discussed a connection between these results and earlier findings on the thermal conductivity of ll structures .",
    "our results are important for the analysis of ts experiments on strongly correlated 1d structures ( in particular , carbon nanotubes @xcite ) out of equilibrium . in this connection ,",
    "let us emphasize the following important point . what can actually be measured in experiment are green functions , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the tdos @xmath93 in the interacting part of the wire , as well as the distribution function @xmath172 in the non - interacting regions are related to @xmath17 and @xmath18 in a simple way . on the other hand , in order to extract the distributions @xmath105 and @xmath173 from @xmath19 in the _ interacting _ part of the wire , a non - trivial deconvolution procedure is necessary .",
    "the broadening of ( split ) fermi - edge structures in @xmath19 in the interacting part of the wire is governed by both the distribution function and the dephasing .",
    "the dephasing contributes to the smearing of fermi - edge singularities also in higher - dimensional ( diffusive ) systems @xcite , and should be taken into account for the accurate interpretation of corresponding experiments@xcite . in the 1d case the role of dephasing becomes particularly dramatic ( if the interaction is sufficiently strong ) .",
    "this is very well illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] : two fermi - edge singularities almost ( middle panel ) or even completely ( lower panel ) merge , despite the fact that the fermi edges in the distribution functions remain well separated ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "a comment of a more general nature is in order here .",
    "our results illustrate the fact that there is no unique answer to the question : `` how much is a ll different from a fermi liquid ? '' on one hand , the strong , power - law zba in tdos of a ll clearly distinguishes it from the fermi liquid",
    ". in more formal terms , the single - particle residue @xmath174 , which is finite in the fermi liquid , vanishes in a power - law fashion at the fermi level of the ll . also the dephasing rate determining the broadening of zba , eq .",
    "( [ tauphi ] ) , is linear in temperature , contrary to the fermi - liquid @xmath175 behavior .",
    "one could think that it makes little sense to speak about fermionic excitations in this situation , but this is not the case .",
    "first , the power - law vanishing of tdos has little importance ( like the value of @xmath174 in the fermi liquid ) for kinetic properties of the system .",
    "second , the dephasing rate ( [ tauphi ] ) is governed by processes with zero energy transfer and do not lead to any energy relaxation . as a result ,",
    "the distribution function of fermionic excitations , @xmath171 , is a fully meaningful concept even in the case of a strong interaction .",
    "it stays preserved as long as the interaction is spatially constant ( or varies adiabatically slow with @xmath80 ) .",
    "furthermore , both the charge and the energy current in the interacting part of the wire can be understood as carried by these fermionic quasiparticles . from this point of view",
    ", the ll is a _",
    "perfect _ fermi liquid .",
    "we conclude the paper by reviewing some future research prospects ; the work in those directions is currently underway .",
    "first , one may consider a more general non - equilibrium situation where the distribution functions `` injected '' into the interacting part of the wire are of non - equilibrium ( e.g. , double - step ) form by themselves @xcite , see setups b , c in fig.1 of ref .  ;",
    "the first of these setups is close to the experimental situation of ref .  .",
    "this requires a generalization of the bosonization technique that will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "second , it is interesting to study correlations between outgoing left- and right - movers . in a general situation",
    ", one finds that their density matrices are not decoupled , i.e. they are entangled , which manifests itself , in particular , in current cross - correlations .",
    "third , one may study the effect of a random variation of the interaction strength @xmath7 in the wire .",
    "if the wire is sufficiently long , plasmons with not too low frequencies get localized . using our general results ,",
    "one concludes that in the left ( right ) half of the wire both distributions @xmath155 , @xmath156 are determined by that of the left ( respectively , right ) reservoir , with a transition region which extends over the localization length of the middle section . to refine this picture",
    ", one has to include into consideration also plasmons with low frequencies ( that remain delocalized ) .",
    "also , including the spectral curvature will induce plasmon decay processes .",
    "( in the context of thermal conductivity , this physics was discussed in ref .  .",
    ") finally , our results can be generalized to the case of chiral ll , where both branches move in the same direction , which is the situation characteristic for quantum - hall edge - state devices @xcite .",
    "we thank d. bagrets , n. birge , a. finkelstein , i. gornyi , d. maslov , y. nazarov , d. polyakov , and r. thomale for useful discussions .",
    "we are particularly grateful to the late yehoshua levinson for numerous illuminating discussions on the physics of non - equilibrium systems .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for a ll wire the green functions @xmath183 and the tdos @xmath184 represent a sum of contributions of both chiral branches . if the density of states in the tunneling probe ( @xmath185 ) is a constant ( as in a normal metal ) , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ app_eq_2 ] ) drops out . in this case",
    "the result is proportional to the tdos in the wire . assuming that the tunneling probe is at zero temperature , one then finds @xmath186 on the other hand , if the density of states in the tunneling probe is strongly energy dependent ( as for superconducting electrodes ) , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ app_eq_2 ] ) survives .",
    "unlike tdos ( which is determined by the difference @xmath187 ) , this term contains also the information about @xmath188 .",
    "therefore , measurement of the tunneling current with two different types of tunneling probes ( normal and superconducting ) allows one to find functions @xmath189 and @xmath190 separately .",
    "the idea to use superconducting electrodes for the tunneling spectroscopy was introduced in ref .   and",
    "more recently employed in ref .  .",
