    "the field of micro - machining is forcing a profound redefinition of the nature and attributes of electronic devices .",
    "this technology allows fabrication of a variety of on - chip fully integrated micromechanical sensors and actuators with a rapidly growing range of applications . in many cases ,",
    "it is highly desirable to shrink the size of mechanical elements down to the nano - scale @xcite .",
    "this allows enhancing the speed of operation by increasing the frequencies of mechanical resonances and improving their sensitivity as sensors .",
    "furthermore , as devices become smaller , their power consumption decreases and the cost of mass fabrication can be significantly lowered .",
    "some key applications of microelectromechanical systems ( mems ) technology include magnetic resonance force microscopy ( mrfm ) @xcite and mass - sensing @xcite .",
    "further miniaturization is also motivated by the quest for mesoscopic quantum effects in mechanical systems .",
    "nonlinear effects are of great importance for micromechanical devices .",
    "the relatively small applied forces needed for driving a micromechanical oscillator into the nonlinear regime are usually easily accessible @xcite .",
    "thus , a variety of useful applications such as frequency synchronization @xcite , frequency mixing and conversion @xcite , parametric and intermodulation amplification @xcite , mechanical noise squeezing @xcite , stochastic resonance @xcite , and enhanced sensitivity mass detection can be implemented by applying modest driving forces .",
    "furthermore , monitoring the displacement of a micromechanical resonator oscillating in the linear regime may be difficult when a displacement detector with high sensitivity is not available .",
    "thus , in many cases the nonlinear regime is the only useful regime of operation .",
    "another key property of systems based on mechanical oscillators is the rate of damping .",
    "for example , in many cases the sensitivity of nems sensors is limited by thermal fluctuation , which is related to damping via the fluctuation dissipation theorem .",
    "in general , micromechanical systems suffer from low quality factors @xmath0 relative to their macroscopic counterparts @xcite .",
    "however , very little is currently known about the underlying physical mechanisms contributing to damping in these devices .",
    "a variety of different physical mechanisms can contribute to damping , including bulk and surface defects @xcite , thermoelastic damping , nonlinear coupling to other modes , phonon - electron coupling , clamping loss @xcite , interaction with two level systems @xcite , etc .",
    "identifying experimentally the contributing mechanisms in a given system can be highly challenging , as the dependence on a variety of parameters has to be examined systematically .",
    "the archetypical model used to describe nonlinear micro- and nanomechanical oscillators is the duffing oscillator @xcite .",
    "this model has been studied in great depth , and special emphasis has been given to the dynamics of the system near the bifurcation points .    in order to describe dissipation processes , a linear damping model is usually employed , either as a phenomenological ansatz , or in the form of linear coupling to thermal bath , which represents the environment . however , nonlinear damping is known to be significant at least in some cases . for example , the effect of nonlinear damping for the case of strictly dissipative force , being proportional to the velocity to the nth power , on the response and bifurcations of driven duffing and other types of nonlinear oscillators @xcite has been studied extensively .",
    "also , nonlinear damping plays an important role in parametrically excited mechanical resonators where without it , solutions will grow without bound .    in spite of the fact that a massive body of literature exists which discusses the nonlinear elastic effects in micro- and nanomechanical oscillators as well as the consequences of nonlinear damping",
    ", the quantitative experimental data on systems with nonlinear damping , especially those nearing bifurcation points , remains scarce .",
    "furthermore , such systems impose special requirements on the experiment parameters and procedures , mainly due to the very slow response times near the bifurcation points .",
    "straightforward evaluation of these requirements by simple measurements can facilitate accurate data acquisition and interpretation .    in the present paper we study damping in a micromechanical oscillator operating in the nonlinear regime excited by an external periodic force at frequencies close to the mechanical fundamental mode .",
    "we consider a duffing oscillator nonlinearly coupled to a thermal bath .",
    "this coupling results in a nonlinear damping force proportional to the velocity multiplied by the displacement squared . as will be shown below",
    ", this approach is equivalent to the case where the damping nonlinearity is proportional to the velocity cubed . in conjunction with a linear dissipation term",
    ", it has also been shown to describe an effective quadratic drag term @xcite .",
    "we find that nonlinear damping in our micromechanical oscillators is non - negligible , and has a significant impact on the oscillators response .",
    "furthermore , we develop a theoretical one - dimensional model of the oscillator s behavior near the bifurcation point .",
    "most of the parameters that govern this behavior can be estimated straightforwardly from frequency response measurements alone , not requiring exact measurement of oscillation amplitudes .",
    "measuring these parameters under varying conditions provides important insights into the underlying physical mechanisms .",
    "we use our results to estimate different dynamic parameters of an experimentally measured micromechanical beam response , and show how these estimations can be used to increase the accuracy of experimental measurements and to estimate measurement errors .",
    "the main source of error is found to be the slowing down behavior near the bifurcation point , also known as the saddle node `` ghost '' @xcite .",
    "we also investigate the possibility of thermal escape of the system from a stable node close to the bifurcation point and find that the probability of this event in our experiments is negligible .    finally , we propose and analyze a continuum mechanics model of our micromechanical oscillator as a planar , weakly nonlinear strongly pretensioned , viscoelastic beam - string .",
    "the analysis of this model illustrates a possible cause for non negligible nonlinear damping as observed in the experiment .",
    "for the experiments we employ micromechanical oscillators in the form of doubly clamped beams made of pdau ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_setup ] ) .",
    "the device is fabricated on a rectangular silicon - nitride membrane ( side length 100 - 200 ) by the means of electron beam lithography followed by thermal metal evaporation .",
    "the membrane is then removed by electron cyclotron resonance ( ecr ) plasma etching , leaving the doubly clamped beam freely suspended .",
    "the bulk micro - machining process used for sample fabrication is similar to the one described in .",
    "the dimensions of the beams are : length 100 - 200 , width 0.25 - 1and thickness 0.2 , and the gap separating the beam and the electrode is 5 - 8 .",
    "measurements of all mechanical properties are done _ in - situ _ by a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) ( working pressure @xmath1 ) , where the imaging system of the microscope is employed for displacement detection .",
    "some of the samples were also measured using an optical displacement detection system described elsewhere @xcite . driving force",
    "is applied to the beam by applying a voltage to the nearby electrode . with a relatively modest driving force",
    ", the system is driven into the region of nonlinear oscillations .",
    "[ htb ]     we use a network analyzer for frequency domain measurements , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_setup_na ] . for time domain measurements of the slow varying envelope",
    "we employ a lock - in amplifier , connected as show in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_setup_lockin ] .",
    "the mechanical oscillator is excited by a monochromatic wave , whose amplitude is modulated by a square wave with low frequency ( 20 - 50 ) .",
    "this results in bursting excitation , which allows measurement of ring - down behavior in time domain .",
    "the lock - in amplifier is locked to the excitation frequency , and measures the amplitude of the slow envelope of the oscillator s response .",
    "the lock - in amplifier time constant should be much smaller than the ring down time , which is governed by dissipation in the micromechanical system .",
    "typically , in our experiments , the time constant is 100and the characteristic ring down time is 10 .",
    "[ htb ]    .,width=326 ]    [ htb ]        the displacement detection scheme described above is not exactly linear , because the amount of the detected secondary electrons or reflected light is not strictly proportional to the mechanical oscillator amplitude , but merely a monotonic function of the latter .",
    "nonuniform distribution of primary electrons or light power in the spot increases this nonlinearity even further .",
    "thus , some distortion in the measured response amplitude is introduced .",
    "we excite the system close to its fundamental mode .",
    "ignoring all higher modes allows us to describe the dynamics using a single degree of freedom @xmath2 .",
    "in the main part of this study , no assumptions are made about the source of linear and nonlinear dissipation .",
    "the energy dissipation is modeled phenomenologically by coupling the micromechanical oscillator to a thermal bath consisting of harmonic oscillators .",
    "physically , several processes may be responsible for mechanical damping , including thermoelastic effects , friction at grain boundaries @xcite , bulk and surface impurities , electrical losses , clamping loss , etc .",
    "we also regard the linear and nonlinear damping constants as independent of one another , although they probably result from same physical processes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonlin_damping_source ] we consider one possible model connecting the linear and nonlinear dissipation coefficients , and compare its predictions to experimental data .",

    "the last result is a particular form of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "we employ a nonlinear , quartic potential @xmath33 in order to describe the elastic properties of the micromechanical beam oscillator .",

    "an additional dissipation term proportional to the cubed velocity , @xmath45 , has been added artificially .",
    "such term , although not easily derived using the analysis sketched above , may be required to describe some macroscopic friction mechanisms , such as losses associated with nonlinear electrical circuits .",
    "it will be shown below that the impact of this term on the behavior of the system is very similar to the impact of @xmath46 .",

    "this model exemplifies one of the possible causes of non negligible nonlinear damping observed in the experiment .",
    "based on this model , we have determined a simple relation connecting the maximal expected value of the nonlinear damping parameter , the bulk young modulus of the material , and its yielding stress . however , while this model can serve as a lower bound , it can not account for the full magnitude of the nonlinear damping measured in the experiment .",
    "additional experimental and theoretical work is required to enhance our understanding of the phenomenon of nonlinear damping in microelectromechanical systems .    in this work",
    "we have demonstrated conclusively that nonlinear damping in micromechanical doubly - clamped beam oscillator may play an important role .",
    "the methods presented in this paper may allow a systematic study of nonlinear damping in micro- and nanomechanical oscillators , which may help revealing the underlying physical mechanisms .",
