    "in the nearly 100 years since galaxy morphology became a topic of research , much has been learned about galactic structure and dynamics . known only as  nebulae \" at that time , galaxies were found to have a wide range of largely inexplicable forms whose relations to one another were a mystery . as data accumulated , it became clear that galaxies are fundamental units of matter in space , and an understanding of how they formed and evolved became one of the major goals of extragalactic studies . even in the era of space observations , galaxy morphology continues to be the backbone of extragalactic research as modern instruments provide information on galactic structure across a wide range of distances and lookback times .    in spite of the advances in instrumentation and the explosion of data , classical galaxy morphology ( i. e. ,",
    "the visual morphological classification in the style of hubble and others ) has not lost its relevance .",
    "the reasons for this are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "morphology is still a logical starting point for understanding galaxies .",
    "sorting galaxies into their morphological categories is similar to sorting stars into spectral types , and can lead to important astrophysical insights .",
    "any theory of galaxy formation and evolution will have to , at some point , account for the bewildering array of galactic forms .",
    "galaxy morphology is strongly correlated with galactic star formation history .",
    "galaxies where star formation ceased gigayears ago tend to look very different from those where star formation continues at the present time .",
    "classical morphology recognizes these differences in an ordered way .",
    "information on galaxy morphology , in the form of new types of galaxies , multi - wavelength views of previously known galaxy types , and higher resolution views of all or part of some galaxies , has exploded as modern instrumentation has superceded the old photographic plates that were once used exclusively for galaxy classification .",
    "galaxy classification has gone beyond the realm of a few thousand galaxies to that of a _ million _ galaxies through the galaxy zoo project .",
    "not only this , but galaxyzoo has taken morphology from the exclusive practice of a few experts to the public at large , thus facilitating citizen science at its best .",
    "galaxy zoo images are also in _ color _ , thus allowing the recognition of special galaxy types and features based on stellar populations or gaseous emission .",
    "finally , deep surveys with the hubble space telescope have extended morphological studies well beyond the realm of the nearby galaxies that dominated early catalogues , allowing detailed morphology to be distinguished at unprecedented redshifts .    now , more than ever , galaxy morphology is a vibrant subject that continues to provide surprises as more galaxies are studied for their morphological characteristics across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "it is clear that a variety of effects are behind observed morphologies , including environmental density and merger / interaction history , internal perturbations , gas accretions , nuclear activity , secular evolution , as well as the diversity in star formation histories , and that a global perspective based on large numbers of galaxies will improve theoretical models and give a more reliable picture of galactic evolution .",
    "the goal of this article is to present the phenomenology of galaxy morphology in an organized way , and highlight recent advances in understanding what factors influence morphology and how various galaxy types are interpreted .",
    "the article is a natural follow - up to the excellent review of galaxy morphology and classification by sandage ( 1975 ) in volume ix of the classic _ stars and stellar systems _ series .",
    "it also complements the recently published _",
    "de vaucouleurs atlas of galaxies _ ( buta , corwin , & odewahn 2007 , hereafter the dva ) , which provided a detailed review of the state and technique of galaxy classification up to about the year 2005 .",
    "illustrations are very important in a review of this nature , and the article draws on a large number of sources of images . for this purpose , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , and the dva have been most useful .",
    "as extended objects rather than point sources , galaxies show a wide variety of forms , some due to intrinsic structures , others due to the way the galaxy is oriented to the line of sight .",
    "the random orientations , and the wide spread of distances , are the principal factors that can complicate interpretations of galaxy morphology .",
    "if we could view every galaxy along its principal axis of rotation , and from the same distance , then fairer comparisons would be possible .",
    "nevertheless , morphologies seen in face - on galaxies can also often be recognized in more inclined galaxies ( figure  [ difftilts ] ) .",
    "it is only for the highest inclinations that morphology switches from face - on radial structure to vertical structure . in general",
    "we either know the planar structure in a galaxy , or we know its vertical structure , but we usually can not know both well from analysis of images alone .",
    "galaxy morphology began to get interesting when the  leviathan of parsonstown \" , the 72-inch meridian - based telescope built in the 1840s by william parsons , third earl of rosse , on the grounds of birr castle in ireland , revealed spiral patterns in many of the brighter herschel and messier  nebulae . \" the nature of these nebulae as galaxies was nt fully known at the time , but the general suspicion was that they were star systems (  island universes \" ) like the milky way , only too distant to be easily resolved into their individual stars .",
    "in fact , one of parsons motivations for building the  leviathan \" was to try and resolve the nebulae to prove this idea .",
    "the telescope did not convincingly do this , but the discovery of spiral structure itself was very important because such structure added to the mystique of the nebulae .",
    "the spiral form was not a random pattern and had to be significant in what it meant .",
    "the telescope was not capable of photography , and observers were only able to render what they saw with it in the form of sketches .",
    "the most famous sketch , that of m51 and its companion ngc 5195 , has been widely reproduced in introductory astronomy textbooks .",
    "while visual observations could reveal some important aspects of galaxy morphology , early galaxy classification was based on photographic plates taken in the blue region of the spectrum .",
    "silver bromide dry emulsion plates were the staple of astronomy beginning in the 1870s and were relatively more sensitive to blue light than to red light .",
    "later , photographs taken with kodak 103a - o and iia - o plates became the standard for galaxy classification . in this part of the spectrum ,",
    "massive star clusters , dominated by spectral class o and b stars , are prominent and often seen to line the spiral arms of galaxies .",
    "these clusters , together with extinction due to interstellar dust , can give blue light images a great deal of detailed structure for classification .",
    "it is these types of photographs which led to the galaxy classification systems in use today .    in such photographs , we see many galaxies as a mix of structures .",
    "inclined galaxies reveal the ubiquitous _ disk _ shape , the most highly flattened subcomponent of any galaxy .",
    "studies of doppler wavelength shifts in the spectra of disk objects ( like hii regions and integrated star light ) reveal that disks rotate differentially .",
    "if a galaxy is spiral , the disk is usually where the arms are found , and also where the bulk of interstellar matter is found .",
    "the radial luminosity profile of a disk is usually _ exponential _ , with departures from an exponential being due to the presence of other structures .    in the central area of a disk - shaped galaxy",
    ", there is also often a bright and sometimes less flattened mass concentration in the form of a _",
    "bulge_. the nature of bulges and how they form has been a topic of much recent research , and is discussed further in section 9 .",
    "disk galaxies range from virtually bulge - less to bulge - dominated . in the center there",
    "may also be a conspicuous _ nucleus _ , a bright central concentration that was usually lost to overexposure in photographs .",
    "nuclei may be dominated by ordinary star light , or may be _ active _ , meaning their spectra show evidence of violent gas motions .",
    "_ bars _ are the most important internal perturbations seen in disk - shaped galaxies .",
    "a bar is an elongated mass often made of old stars crossing the center .",
    "if spiral structure is present , the arms usually begin near the ends of the bar .",
    "although most easily recognized in the face - on view , bars have generated great interest recently in the unique ways they can also be detected in the edge - on view .",
    "not all bars are made exclusively of old stars . in some bulge - less galaxies ,",
    "the bar has considerable gas and recent star formation .",
    "related to bars are elongated disk features known as _",
    "ovals_. ovals usually differ from bars in lacking higher order fourier components ( i.e. , have azimuthal intensity distributions that vary mainly as 2@xmath0 ) , but nevertheless can be major perturbations in a galactic disk .",
    "the entire disk of a galaxy may be oval , or a part of it may be oval .",
    "oval disks are most easily detected if there is considerable light or structure at larger radii .",
    "_ rings _ are prominent features in some galaxies .",
    "often defined by recent star formation , rings may be completely closed features or may be partial or open , the latter called  pseudorings . \"",
    "rings can be narrow and sharp or broad and diffuse .",
    "it is particularly interesting that several kinds of rings are seen , and that some galaxies can have as many as four recognizeable ring features .",
    "_ nuclear rings _ are the smallest rings and are typically seen in the centers of barred galaxies . _",
    "inner rings _ are intermediate - scale features that often envelop the bar in a barred galaxy .",
    "outer rings are large , low surface brightness features that typically lie at about twice the radius of a bar .",
    "other kinds of rings , called accretion rings , polar rings , and collisional rings , are also known but are much rarer than the inner , outer , and nuclear rings of barred galaxies .",
    "the latter kinds of rings are also not exclusive to barred galaxies , but may be found also in nonbarred galaxies .",
    "_ lenses _ are features , made usually of old stars , that have a shallow brightness gradient interior to a sharp edge .",
    "they are commonly seen in hubble s disk - shaped s0 class ( section 5.2 ) .",
    "if a bar is present , the bar may fill a lens in one dimension .",
    "lenses may be round or slightly elliptical in shape .",
    "if elliptical in shape they would also be considered ovals .",
    "_ nuclear bars _",
    "are the small bars occasionally seen in the centers of barred galaxies , often lying within a nuclear ring .",
    "when present in a barred galaxy , the main bar is called the  primary bar \" and the nuclear bar is called the  secondary bar . \"",
    "it is possible for a nuclear bar to exist in the absence of a primary bar .    _",
    "dust lanes _ are often seen in optical images of spiral galaxies , and may appear extremely regular and organized .",
    "they are most readily evident in edge - on or highly inclined disk galaxies , but are still detectable in the face - on view , often on the leading edges of bars or the concave sides of strong inner spiral arms .",
    "spiral arms may also show considerable morphological variation .",
    "spirals may be regular 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4-armed patterns , and may also be higher order multi - armed patterns .",
    "spirals may be tightly wrapped ( low pitch angle ) or very open ( high pitch angle . )",
    "a _ grand - design _ spiral is a well - defined global pattern , often detectable as smooth variations in the stellar density of old disk stars .",
    "a _ flocculent _",
    "spiral is made of small pieces of spiral structure that appear sheared by differential rotation .",
    "their appearance can be strongly affected by dust , such that at longer wavelengths a flocculent spiral may appear more grand - design .",
    "pseudorings can be thought of as variable pitch angle spirals which close on themselves , as opposed to continuously opening , constant pitch angle , logarithmic spirals .",
    "there are also numerous structures outside the scope of traditional galaxy classification , often connected with strong interactions between galaxies . plus , the above described features are not necessarily applicable or relevant to what we see in very distant galaxies .",
    "accounting for all of the observed features of nearby galaxies , and attempting to connect what we see nearby to what is seen at high redshift , is a major goal of morphological studies .",
    "as noted by sandage ( 1975 ) , the first step in studying any class of objects is a classification of those objects .",
    "classification built around small numbers of shared characteristics can be used for sorting galaxies into fundamental categories , which can then be the basis for further research . from such research ,",
    "physical relationships between identified classes may emerge , and these relationships may foster a theoretical interpretation that places the whole class of objects into a global context . there is no doubt that such an approach greatly contributed to the development of the science of biology , and this is no less true for galaxies .",
    "the genesis of galaxy classification is to take the complex combinations of structures described in the previous section and summarize them with a few type symbols .",
    "sandage ( 1975 ) describes the earlier classification systems of wolf , reynolds , lundmark , and shapley that fell into dis - use more than 50 years ago .",
    "the morgan ( 1958 ) spectral type / concentration classification system , which was based on a connection between morphology ( specifically central concentration ) and the stellar content of the central regions , was used recently by bershady , jangren , & conselice ( 2000 ) in a mostly quantitative manner ( see also abraham et al . 2003 ) . thus , morgan s system has in a way survived into the modern era but not in the purely visual form that he proposed .",
    "only one morgan galaxy type , the supergiant cd type , is still used extensively ( section 10.6 ) .",
    "van den bergh s luminosity / arm morphology classification system is described by van den bergh ( 1998 ; see section 6.5 ) .",
    "the big survivor of the early visual classification systems was that of hubble ( 1926 , 1936 ) , as later revised and expanded upon by sandage ( 1961 ) and de vaucouleurs ( 1959 ) .",
    "sandage ( 1975 ) has argued that one reason hubble s view prevailed is that he did not try and account for every superficial detail , but kept his classes broad enough that the vast majority of galaxies could be sorted into one of his proposed bins .",
    "these bins were schematically illustrated in hubble s famous  tuning fork \" ( hubble 1936 ; reproduced in figure  [ tuning_fork_schematic ] ) recognizing a sequence of progressive flattenings from ellipticals to spirals .",
    "ellipticals had only two classification details : the smoothly declining brightness distribution with no inflections , and no evidence for a disk ; and the ellipticity of the isophotes , indicated by a number after the  e \" symbol .",
    "( for example , e3 means the ellipticity is 0.3 . )",
    "spirals were systems more flattened than an e7 galaxy that could be subdivided according to the degree of central concentration , the degree of openness of the arms , the degree of resolution of the arms into complexes of star formation ( all three criteria determining position along the fork ) , and on the presence or absence of a bar ( determining the appropriate prong of the fork ) .",
    "the s0 class at the juncture of the prongs of the fork was still hypothetical in 1936 . as  armless disk galaxies , \" s0s were mysterious because all examples known in 1936 were barred .",
    "these were classified as sba , but this was a troubling inconsistency because nonbarred sa galaxies had full spiral patterns .",
    "hubble predicted the existence of nonbarred s0s to fill the gap between type e7 and sa and cure what he felt was a  cataclysmic \" transition .",
    "it was not long before hubble himself realized that the tuning fork could not adequately represent the full diversity of galaxy morphologies , and after 1936 he worked on a revision that included real examples of the sought group : nonbarred s0 galaxies .",
    "based on fragmentary notes he left behind , sandage ( 1961 ) prepared the _",
    "hubble atlas of galaxies _ to illustrate hubble s revision , and also added a third dimension : the presence or absence of a ring .",
    "this was the first major galaxy atlas illustrating a classification system in a detailed , sophisticated way with beautifully produced photographs .",
    "hubble s revision , with van den bergh luminosity classes ( sandage & tammann 1981 ) , was updated and extended to types later than sc by sandage & bedke ( 1994 ) .",
    "because sandage ( 1961 ) and sandage & bedke ( 1994 ) describe the hubble - sandage revision so thoroughly , the details will not be repeated here . instead",
    ", the focus of the next section will be on the de vaucouleurs revision as outlined in the dva .",
    "the reasons for this are : ( 1 ) the de vaucouleurs classification provides the most familar galaxy types to extragalactic researchers , mostly because of extensive continuing use of the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( rc3 , de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) ; and ( 2 ) the de vaucouleurs classification is still evolving to cover more details of galaxy morphology considered significant at this time .",
    "it should be noted that both the de vaucouleurs and hubble - sandage revisions are strictly applicable only to @xmath1 @xmath2 0 galaxies and that it is often difficult to fit objects having @xmath1 @xmath3 0.5 neatly into the categories defining these classification systems .",
    "high redshift galaxy morphology is described in section 13 .",
    "the hubble tuning fork is useful because it provides a visual representation of information hubble ( 1926 ) had only stated in words .",
    "the fork contains an implication of continuity .",
    "for example , it does not rule out that there might be galaxies intermediate in characteristics between an `` sa '' or `` sb '' spiral , or between a normal `` s '' spiral and a barred `` sb '' spiral .",
    "continuity along the elliptical galaxy sequence was always implied as a smooth variation from round ellipticals ( e0 ) to the most flattened ellipticals ( e7 ) .",
    "sandage ( 1961 ) describes the modifications that made the hubble system more three - dimensional : the introduction of the ( r ) ( inner ring ) and ( s ) ( pure spiral ) subtypes .",
    "continuity even with this characteristic was possible , using the combined subtype ( rs ) .",
    "thus , already by 1961 , the hubble classification system had become much more complicated than it was in 1926 or 1936 .",
    "the addition of the s0 class was one reason for this , but the ( r ) and ( s ) subtypes were another .    in the hubble - sandage classification , it became common to denote galaxies on the left part of the hubble sequence as  early - type \" galaxies and those on the right part as  late - type \" galaxies . by the same token",
    ", sa and sba spirals became  early - type spirals \" while sc and sbc spirals became  late - type spirals .",
    "\" sb and sbb types became known as  intermediate - type spirals . \" the reason for these terminologies was convenience and borrows terminology often used for stars .",
    "young , massive stars of spectral classes o and b were known as  early - type stars \" while older stars of cooler spectral types were known as  late - type stars . \"",
    "hubble stated that his use of these temporal descriptions for galaxies had no evolutionary implications .",
    "an irony in this is that it eventually became clear that early - type galaxies are dominated by late - type stars , while late - type galaxies often have significant numbers of early - type stars .",
    "de vaucouleurs ( 1959 ) took the idea of continuity of galaxy morphology a step further by developing what he referred to as the _ classification volume _",
    "( figure  [ classification_volume ] ) . in this revision of the hubble - sandage ( 1961 ) classification ,",
    "galaxy morphology represents a continuous sequence of forms in a three - dimensional volume with a long axis and circular cross - sections of varying size .",
    "the long axis of the volume is the _ stage _ , or type , and it represents the long axis of the original hubble tuning fork .",
    "the short axes are the family and the variety , which refer to apparent bar strength and the presence or absence of an inner ring , respectively .",
    "in addition to hubble s original stages e , sa , sb , and sc , the classification volume includes new stages : late ellipticals : e@xmath4 ,  very late \" spirals : sd ,  magellanic spirals \" : sm , and  magellanic irregulars \" : i m .",
    "the s0 class is included in the same position along the sequence , between e s and spirals , but is subdivided into three stages .",
    "the characteristics defining individual stages are described further in section 5.2 .",
    "the stage is considered the most fundamental dimension of the classification volume because measured physical parameters , such as integrated color indices , mean surface brightnesses , and neutral hydrogen content correlate well with position along the sequence ( e. g. , buta et al .",
    "early - type galaxies tend to have redder colors , higher average surface brightnesses , and lower neutral hydrogen content than late - type galaxies .",
    "the family and variety axes of the classification volume indicate the considerable variations in morphology at a given stage . a famous sketch of families and varieties near stage sb , drawn by de vaucouleurs himself during a cloudy night at mcdonald observatory circa 1962 , is shown in sandage ( 1975 ) and in figure 1.13 of the dva .",
    "the classification volume is broader in the middle compared to the ends because the diversity of galaxy morphology is largest at stages like s0/a and sa .",
    "bars and rings are often most distinct and most recognizable at these stages .",
    "such features are not characteristic of e galaxies , so the volume must be narrow at that end . along the s0 sequence , bars and rings are barely developed among the earliest s0s ( s0@xmath5 ) and well - developed among the late s0s ( s0@xmath4 ) , thus the volume begins to broaden .",
    "among very late - type galaxies , sd , sdm , sm , and i m , bars are actually very frequent , but closed rings ( r ) are not .",
    "thus , the volume narrows at that end as well .    for the purposes of illustrating morphology , blue light digital images converted to units of magnitudes per square arcsecond are used when available .",
    "this approach is described in the dva , and requires calibration of the images , usually based on published photoelectric multi - aperture photometry .",
    "in addition , some of the illustrations used ( especially in section 15 ) are from the sloan digital sky survey or from other sources .",
    "these are not in the same units but still provide excellent illustrations of morphology .",
    "sdss color images differ from dva images mainly in the central regions , where sdss images sometimes lose detail .",
    "unlike the dva , the scope of this article extends beyond the traditional @xmath6 wavebands .",
    "it is only during the past 20 years that significant morphological information has been obtained for galaxies outside these bands , mostly at mid- and far - ultraviolet and mid - ir wavelengths from space - based observatories capable of imaging in these wavelengths to unprecedented depths , providing a new view of galaxy morphology that is only beginning to be explored .",
    "a useful review of many issues in morphology is provided by van den bergh ( 1998 ) .",
    "elliptical galaxies are smooth , amorphous systems with a continuously declining brightness distribution and no breaks , inflections , zones , or structures , as well as no sign of a disk .",
    "figure  [ egals ] shows some good examples . because ellipticals are dominated by old stars and are relatively dust - free , they look much the same at different wavelengths .",
    "hubble s subclassification of ellipticals according to apparent ellipticity ( en , where n=10(1-b / a ) , b / a being the apparent flattening ) was useful but virtually no physical characteristics of ellipticals correlate with this parameter ( kormendy & djorgovski 1989 ) . the n value in the en classification is simply the projected ellipticity and not easily interpreted in terms of a true flattening without direct knowledge of the orientation of the symmetry planes .",
    "luminous ellipticals are thought to be triaxial in structure with an anisotropic velocity dispersion tensor , while lower luminosity ellipticals are more isotropic oblate rotators ( davies et al .",
    "1983 ) . studies of rotational to random kinetic energy ( @xmath7/@xmath8 ) versus apparent flattening ( @xmath9 ) show that massive ellipticals are slow anisotropic rotators .",
    "ellipticals follow a fundamental plane relationship between the effective radius @xmath10 of the light distribution , the central velocity dispersion @xmath11 , and mean effective surface brightness @xmath12 ( see review by kormendy & djorgovski 1989 ) .",
    "dwarf elliptical galaxies may not follow the same relation as massive ellipticals ; this is discussed by ferguson & binggeli ( 1994 ) .    the lack of fundamental significance of hubble s en classification led some authors to seek an alternative , more physically useful approach .",
    "kormendy & bender ( 1996 ; see also the review by schweizer 1998 ) proposed a revision to hubble s tuning fork handle that orders ellipticals according to their velocity anisotropy , since this is a significant determinant of e galaxy intrinsic shapes .",
    "velocity anisotropy correlates with the _ deviations _ of e galaxy isophotes from pure elliptical shapes , measured by the parameter @xmath13 , the relative amplitude of the @xmath14 fourier term of these deviations .",
    "if this relative amplitude is positive , then the isophotes are pointy , disky ovals , while if negative , the isophotes are boxy ovals . a boxy elliptical",
    "is classified as e(b ) , while a disky elliptical is classified as e(d ) .",
    "the correlation with anisotropy is such that e(b ) galaxies have less rotation on average and more velocity anistropy than e(d ) galaxies .",
    "the kormendy & bender proposed classification is shown in figure  [ boxydisky ] , together with two exceptional examples that show the characteristic isophote shapes .",
    "the leftmost of these two , ngc 7029 , is an unusually obvious boxy elliptical at larger radii .",
    "this boxiness is the basis for the classification e(b)5 .",
    "however , ngc 7029 is not boxy throughout : it shows evidence of a small inner disk and hence is disky at small radii .",
    "this is not necessarily taken into account in the classification .",
    "the other image shown in figure  [ boxydisky ] is ngc 4697 , a galaxy whose isophotes are visually disky .",
    "the idea with the kormendy & bender classification is that it is the disky ellipticals which connect to s0 galaxies , and not the boxy ellipticals .",
    "however , ngc 7029 demonstrates that diskiness and boxiness can be a function of radius , thus perhaps a smooth connection between e(b ) and e(d ) types [ i.e. , type e(b , d ) ] is possible and the order shown in the kormendy & bender revision to the hubble tuning fork , with boxy es blending into the disky es , could be reasonable .    note",
    "that while the classical en classifications of ellipticals were designed by hubble to be estimated by eye , this is not easily done for the e(b ) and e(d ) classifications , which are most favored to be seen only when the disk is nearly edge - on . face - on es with imbedded disks will not show disky isophotes .",
    "for example , ngc 7029 and 4697 are extreme cases where the isophotal deviations are obvious by eye .",
    "but for most e galaxies , the e(b)n and e(d)n classifications can only be judged reliably with measurements of the @xmath13 parameter .",
    "the de vaucouleurs classification of ellipticals includes a slightly more advanced type called e@xmath4 , or  late \" ellipticals .",
    "it was originally intended to describe  the first stage of the transition to the s0 class \" ( de vaucouleurs 1959 ) .",
    "five examples of e@xmath4 galaxies are shown in the second row of figure  [ egals ] .",
    "galaxies classified as e@xmath4 can be the most subtle s0s , but many of the e@xmath4 cases listed in rc3 are the brightest members of clusters that have shallow enough brightness profiles to appear to have an extended envelope ( see section 10.6 ) . of the five e@xmath4 galaxies shown ,",
    "only ngc 4623 ( rare type e@xmath47 ) seems consistent with de vaucouleurs s original view .",
    "it is also a much lower luminosity system than the other four cases shown .",
    "while s0@xmath5 is the type most often confused with ellipticals in visual classification , the bin has a wide spread from the most obvious to the least obvious cases .",
    "thus , a type like e@xmath4 is still useful for distinguishing transitions from e to s0 galaxies .",
    "the photometric properties of ellipticals depend on luminosity . in terms of sersic @xmath15 profile",
    "fits , large , luminous ellipticals tend to have profiles described better by @xmath16@xmath174 , while smaller , lower luminosity ellipticals tend to have @xmath16@xmath184 , with values as low as 1 ( e. g. , caon , capaccioli , & donofrio 1993 ) .",
    "graham & guzmn ( 2003 ) discuss the implications of this correlation on proposed dichotomies of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , kormendy 1985 ; see also ferrarese et al .",
    "these studies received a major impetus from the massive photometric analysis of virgo cluster elliptical galaxies by kormendy et al .",
    "two issues were considered by these authors ( figure  [ cores ] ) .",
    "the first was whether galaxies classified as dwarf ellipticals (  de `` ; see section 15.2 ) in the virgo cluster really are the low luminosity extension of more massive , conventional ellipticals , or something different altogether . based on parameter correlations , such as @xmath19 , the major axis radius of the isophote containing 10% of the total visual luminosity , versus @xmath20 , the surface brightness of this isophote , kormendy et al . show that even the most elliptical - like and luminous de galaxies lie on a distinct sequence from normal elliptical galaxies , which tend to lie on a higher density sequence . in a graph of @xmath21-band central surface brightness versus absolute @xmath21-band magnitude , the de galaxies lie in a region occupied by magellanic irregular galaxies , suggesting a link between the groups and consistent with the earlier conclusions of kormendy ( 1985 ) .",
    "kormendy et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggest reclassifying binggeli , sandage , & tammann s ( 1985 ) ' ' de `` galaxies and related objects ( like dwarf s0 , or ds0 galaxies ) as ' ' spheroidal `` ( sph ) galaxies , including the type ' ' sph , n `` , meaning ' ' nucleated spheroidal \" galaxy ( section 15.2 ) .",
    "figure  [ cores ] shows several examples of sph , n galaxies as compared with several genuine elliptical galaxies .",
    "the morphological appearance alone does not necessarily distinguish the two classes .",
    "the classification is physical , being based mainly on parameter correlations .",
    "kormendy et al .",
    "suggest that sph galaxies are formed from late - type systems by environmental effects and supernovae .",
    "the second issue considered was the physical distinction between  core \" elliptical galaxies , those where the surface brightness profile approaches either a constant level or a slightly sloped level with radius approaching zero , and  coreless \" ellipticals ( also known as  power law \" es ) where the inner profile steepens with decreasing radius ( kormendy 1999 ) .",
    "kormendy et al .",

    "examples are shown in figure  [ s0gals ] .",
    "the display of galaxy images in units of mag arcsec@xmath23 makes lenses especially easy to detect , as noted in the dva .",
    "even if a lens is nt obvious , a galaxy could still be an s0 if it shows evidence of an exponential disk .",
    "( lenses are also not exclusive to s0s . )",
    "the  no spiral arms \" characteristic is much stricter in the hubble - sandage classification than in the de vaucouleurs interpretation , because varieties ( r , rs , and s ) are carried into the de vaucouleurs classifications of s0s .",
    "this allows the possibility of a classification like sa(s)0@xmath5 , which would be very difficult to recognize .",
    "bars enter in the classification of s0s in a similar manner as for spirals .",
    "figure  [ s0gals ] shows mainly stage differences among nonbarred and barred s0s .",
    "the stage for s0s ranges from early ( s0@xmath5 ) , to intermediate ( s0@xmath24 ) , and finally to late ( s0@xmath4 ) , in a succession of increasing detail .",
    "the earliest nonbarred s0s may be mistaken for elliptical galaxies on photographic images , and indeed sandage & bedke ( 1994 ) note cases where they believe an s0 galaxy has been misclassified as an elliptical by de vaucouleurs in his reference catalogues ( see also _ the revised shapley - ames catalogue _ , rsa , sandage & tammann 1981 ) .",
    "this kind of misinterpretation is less likely for types s0@xmath24 and s0@xmath4 , because these will tend to show more obvious structure .",
    "the morphological distinction between e and s0 galaxies has been considered from a quantitative kinematic point of view by emsellem et al .",
    "these authors argue that the division of early - type galaxies into e and s0 types is  contrived \" , and that it is more meaningful to divide them according to a quantitative kinematic parameter called @xmath25 , the specific angular momentum of the stellar component , which is derived from a two - dimensional velocity field obtained with the sauron integral field spectrograph ( bacon et al . 2001 ) . based on this parameter ,",
    "early - type galaxies are divided into slow and fast rotators , i. e. , whether they are characterized by large - scale rotation or not . in a sample of 48 early - types ,",
    "most were found to be fast rotators classified as a mix of e and s0 types , while the remainder were found to be slow rotators classified as es .",
    "this kind of approach , which provides a more physical distinction among early - types , does not negate completely the value of the e and s0 subdivisions , but highlights again the persistent difficulty of distinguishing the earliest s0s from es by morphology alone .",
    "the transition type s0/a shows the beginnings of spiral structure .",
    "two examples are included in figure  [ s0gals ] , one nonbarred and the other barred .",
    "type s0/a is a well - defined stage characterized in the de vaucouleurs 3d classification volume as having a high diversity in family and variety characteristics .",
    "the type received a negative characterization as the  garbage bin \" of the hubble sequence at one time because troublesome dusty irregulars , those originally classified as  irr ii \" by holmberg ( 1950 ) and later as  i0 \" by de vaucouleurs , seemed to fit better in that part of the sequence .",
    "[ in fact , de vaucouleurs , de vaucouleurs , & corwin ( 1976 ) assigned the numerical stage index @xmath26=0 to both s0/a and i0 galaxies .",
    "] however , this problem is only a problem at optical wavelengths . at longer wavelengths ( e.g. , 3.6 microns ) ,",
    "types such as irr ii or i0 are less needed as they are defined mainly by dust ( buta et al .",
    "2010a ) .",
    "in general , the stage for spirals is based on the appearance of the spiral arms ( degree of openness and resolution ) and also on the relative prominence of the bulge or central concentration .",
    "these are the usual criteria originally applied by hubble ( 1926 , 1936 ) .",
    "figure  [ tuning_fork ] shows the stage sequence for spirals divided according to bar classification ( sa , sab , sb ) , and as modified and extended by de vaucouleurs ( 1959 ) to include sd and sm types . intermediate stages , such as sab , sbc , scd , and sdm , are shown in figure  [ intermediate_types ] .",
    "as noted by de vaucouleurs ( 1963 ) , these latter stages are almost as common as the basic ones .",
    "the three hubble criteria are basically seen in the illustrated galaxies .",
    "sa galaxies tend to have significant bulges , and tightly - wrapped and relatively smooth spiral arms .",
    "sab galaxies are similar to sa galaxies , but show more obvious resolution of the arms .",
    "sb galaxies have more resolution and more open arms , and generally smaller bulges than sab galaxies .",
    "sbc galaxies have considerable resolution and openness of the arms , and also usually significant bulges . in sc galaxies",
    ", the bulge tends to be very small and the arms patchy and open .",
    "scd galaxies tend to be relatively bulgeless , patchy armed sc galaxies .",
    "stage sd is distinctive mainly as almost completely bulgeless late - type spirals with often ill - defined spiral structure .",
    "stages sdm and sm are the most characteristically asymmetric stages , the latest spiral types along the de vaucouleurs revised hubble sequence .",
    "they are described in detail by de vaucouleurs & freeman ( 1972 ) and by odewahn ( 1991 ) .",
    "sm is generally characterized by virtually no bulge and a single principle spiral arm .",
    "if a bar is present , it is usually not at the center of the disk isophotes , unlike what is normally seen in earlier type barred spirals .",
    "this leads to the concept of an _ offset barred galaxy_. the single spiral arm emanates from one end of the bar . as noted by freeman ( 1975 ) , this is a basic and characteristic asymmetry of the mass distribution of magellanic barred spirals .",
    "sdm galaxies are similar , but may show a weaker or shorter second arm . in figure  [ tuning_fork ] ,",
    "ngc 4618 is an especially good example of an sbm type ( odewahn 1991 ) , while in figure  [ intermediate_types ] , ngc 4027 is illustrated as type sbdm .",
    "an important issue regarding these galaxies is whether the optically offset bar is also offset from the dynamical rotation center of the disk . in a detailed hi study of the interacting galaxy pair ngc 4618 and 4625 , bush & wilcots ( 2004 ) found very regular velocity fields and extended hi disks , but no strong offset of the rotation center from the center of the bar",
    "this is similar to what pence et al .",
    "( 1988 ) found for the offset barred galaxy ngc 4027 , based on optical fabry - perot interferometry .",
    "in contrast , both magellanic clouds , which are also offset barred galaxies , were found to have hi rotation centers significantly offset from the center of the bar ( kerr & de vaucouleurs 1955 ) .",
    "in general , the application of hubble s three spiral criteria allows consistent classification of spiral types .",
    "nevertheless , sometimes the criteria are inconsistent .",
    "for example , small bulge sa galaxies are described by sandage ( 1961 ) and sandage & bedke ( 1994 ) . barred galaxies with nuclear rings can have spiral arms like those of an earlier hubble type and very small bulges .",
    "in such conflicting cases , the emphasis is usually placed on the appearance of the arms . also , while late - type sdm and sm galaxies are characteristically asymmetric , other types may be asymmetric as well . on average , the bulge - to - total luminosity ratio is related to hubble type , but the result is sensitive to how galaxies are decomposed ( e. g. , laurikainen et al .",
    "asymmetry has been quantified by conselice ( 1997 ) .",
    "the family classifications sa , sab , and sb are purely visual estimates of bar strength , for both spirals and s0s . they are highlighted already in figures  [ s0gals]  [ intermediate_types ] , but the continuity of this characteristic is better illustrated in figure  [ continuity ] , where de vaucouleurs ( 1963 ) underline classifications ( s@xmath27b and sa@xmath28 ) are also shown .",
    "an sa galaxy has no evident bar in general , although high inclination can cause a mistaken sa classification if a bar is highly foreshortened .",
    "also , internal dust may obscure a bar ( see , e. g. , eskridge et al .",
    "an sb galaxy should have a clear , well - defined bar .",
    "the intermediate bar classification sab is one of the hallmarks of the de vaucouleurs system , and is used to recognize galaxies having characteristics intermediate between barred and nonbarred galaxies .",
    "it is used for well - defined ovals or simply weaker - looking normal bars .",
    "the weakest primary bars are denoted s@xmath27b while the classification sa@xmath28 is usually assigned to more classical bars that appear only somewhat weaker than conventional bars .",
    "most of the time , galaxies which should be classified as sa@xmath28 are simply classified as sb .",
    "variety is also treated as a continuous classification parameter ( figure  [ continuity ] , second row ) .",
    "a spiral galaxy having a completely closed or very nearly completely closed inner ring is denoted ( r ) .",
    "the spiral arms usually break from the ring .",
    "if the spiral arms break directly from the central region or the ends of a bar , forming a continuously winding , open pattern , the variety is ( s ) .",
    "the intermediate variety ( rs ) is also well - defined .",
    "inner rings which appear broken or partial are in this category .",
    "the  dash - dot - dash in brackets \" morphology : ( -o- ) , where a bar with a bulge is bracketted by spiral arcs overshooting the bar axis , is very typical of variety ( rs ) .",
    "the example of this shown in figure  [ continuity ] is ngc 4548 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath29s to denote an inner ring made up of tightly wrapped spiral arms that do not quite close , while the notation r@xmath30 is used for very open , barely recognizable , inner pseudorings .",
    "a good example of the former is ngc 3450 , while an example of the latter is ngc 5371 .    a _",
    "spindle _ is a highly inclined disk galaxy . for blue - light images , usually an  sp \"",
    "after the classification automatically implies considerable uncertainty in the interpretation , because family and variety are not easily distinguished when the inclination is high .",
    "figure  [ edge - ons ] shows , however , that stages can be judged reasonably reliably for edge - on galaxies .",
    "one important development in the classification of edge - on galaxies has been the ability to recognize edge - on bars through boxy / peanut and  x \"- shapes .",
    "boxy / peanut bulges in edge - on galaxies were proven to be bars seen edge - on from kinematic considerations ( e. g. , kuijken & merrifield 1995 ) .",
    "this shape is evident in ngc 4425 ( row 1 , column 4 of figure  [ edge - ons ] ; see also section 9 ) .    for spiral and s0 galaxies that are not too highly inclined ( i.e. , not spindles ) , once the stage , family , and variety are determined these are combined in the order family , variety , stage for a final full type .",
    "for example , ngc 1300 is of the family sb , variety ( s ) , and stage b , thus its full type is sb(s)b .",
    "the s0@xmath4 galaxy ngc 4340 has both a bar and inner ring and its full type is sb(r)0@xmath4 .",
    "the classification is flexible enough that if , for example , the family and variety of a galaxy can not be reliably determined owing to high inclination , while the stage can still be assessed , then the symbols can be dropped and a type such as  sb \" or  s0 \" can still be noted .",
    "magellanic irregular galaxies represent the last normal stage of the de vaucouleurs revised hubble sequence .",
    "several examples are shown in figure  [ irregulars ] .",
    "the objects illustrated in the top row are all examples of ( s)-variety irregulars with bars or some trace of a bar .",
    "nevertheless , not all magellanic irregulars have bars . irregulars of the lowest luminosities are usually classified simply as i m since the sophistication of structure needed to distinguish something like  family \" may not exist for such galaxies .",
    "irregular galaxies are important for their star formation characteristics . as noted by hunter ( 1997 ) , irregulars are similar to spirals in having both old and young stars , as well as dust , atomic , molecular , and ionized gas , but lack the spiral structure that might trigger star formation .",
    "thus , they are useful laboratories for examining how star formation occurs in the absence of spiral arms .",
    "although irregulars are largely defined by a lack of well - organized structure like spiral arms , the two lower right galaxies in figure  [ irregulars ] are not so disorganized looking and seem different from the other cases shown .",
    "ngc 5253 looks almost like a tilted s0 galaxy , yet it has no bulge at its center nor any obvious lenses .",
    "instead , the central area is an irregular zone of active star formation .",
    "the central zone was interpreted by van den bergh ( 1980a ) as  fossil evidence \" for a burst of star formation , possibly triggered by an interaction with neighboring m83 .",
    "this is a case where the de vaucouleurs classification of i0 seems reasonable : ngc 5253 is an early - type galaxy with a central starburst , probably the youngest and closest example known ( vanzi & sauvage 2004 ) .",
    "it is a magellanic irregular galaxy imbedded in a smooth s0-like background known to have an early - type star spectrum .",
    "ngc 1705 , also shown in figure  [ irregulars ] , is similar but has a super star cluster near the center and obvious peculiar filaments .",
    "it is classified as a blue compact dwarf by gil de paz et al .",
    "both galaxies are classified as amorphous by sandage & bedke ( 1994 ) .",
    "the de vaucouleurs classification volume recognizes three principal aspects of galaxy morphology , but clearly there are many more dimensions than three .",
    "stage , family , and variety are the dimensions most clearly highlighted in blue light images and have a wide scope .",
    "other dimensions may be considered and for some there is explicit notation in use .      published de vaucouleurs types include an extra dimension known as the outer ring / pseudoring classification .",
    "several examples of outer rings and pseudorings are shown in figure  [ outer_rings ] .",
    "an outer ring is a large , often diffuse structure , typically seen in barred early - type galaxies ( stages s0@xmath4 to sa ) at a radius approximately twice that of the bar .",
    "closed outer rings are recognized with the type symbol ( r ) preceding the main part of the classification .",
    "for example , an sb(r)0@xmath4 galaxy having an outer ring has a full classification of ( r)sb(r)0@xmath4 .",
    "interestingly , rare cases of double outer ring galaxies , type ( rr ) , are known , where two detached outer rings are seen ; an example is ngc 2273 shown in the upper left frame of figure  [ outer_rings ] .    in later - type galaxies , a large outer ring - like feature",
    "is often seen made of outer spiral arms whose variable pitch angle causes them to close together .",
    "these features are classified as outer pseudorings , symbolized by ( r@xmath31 ) preceding the main type symbols [ e.g. , as in ( r@xmath31)sb(r)ab ] .",
    "outer pseudorings are mainly observed in sa to sbc galaxies , and are only rarely seen in the very late stages sc - sm .    among bright nearby galaxies , outer rings and pseudorings",
    "are found at about the 10% level ( buta & combes 1996 ) .",
    "typically , outer rings are fainter than 24 mag arcsec@xmath23 in blue light . with such low surface brightnesses ,",
    "the rings can be easily lost to galactic extinction .",
    "the division between outer rings and pseudorings is also not sharp .",
    "some outer pseudorings are only barely distinguishable from outer rings .",
    "continuity applies to these features as it does for inner rings although there is no symbol other than  s \" for an outer spiral pattern which does not close into an outer pseudoring .",
    "although closed outer rings ( r ) are equally well - recognized in the rsa and the carnegie and hubble atlases , outer pseudorings are a unique feature of the de vaucouleurs revision .",
    "the value of recognizing these features is that many show morphologies consistent with the theoretical expectations of the outer lindblad resonance ( olr , schwarz 1981 ) , one of the major low - order resonances that can play a role in disk evolution .",
    "resonance rings are discussed further in section 10.1 , but figure  [ olr_schematic ] shows schematics of the morphologies generally linked to this resonance .",
    "the schematics are designed to highlight the subtle but well - defined aspects of these features , while figure  [ olr_subclasses ] shows images of several examples of each morphology , including the  models \" used for the schematic .",
    "outer rings of type r@xmath32 are closed rings that are slightly dimpled towards the bar axis , a shape which connects directly to one of the main periodic orbit families near the olr as shown in schwarz ( 1981 ) and in the dva .",
    "outer pseudorings of type r@xmath33 are similar to type r@xmath32 but are made of two spiral arms that wind approximately 180@xmath24 with respect to the ends of the bar .",
    "even these will usually show a dimpled shape .",
    "outer pseudorings of type r@xmath34 are different from this in that two spiral arms wind 270@xmath24 with respect to the ends of the bar , such that the arms are doubled in the quadrants immediately trailing the bar .",
    "the shapes r@xmath32 , r@xmath33 , and r@xmath34 were predicted by schwarz ( 1981 ) based on  sticky - particle \" numerical simulations . not predicted by those simulations ( but later shown in extensions of those simulations by byrd et al .",
    "1994 and rautiainen & salo 2000 ) is an interesting combined ring morphology called r@xmath32r@xmath34 , which consists of a closed r@xmath32 ring and an r@xmath34 pseudoring .",
    "this combination is especially important because it demonstrates not only a continuity of morphologies among outer rings and pseudorings different from the continuity between outer rings and pseudorings in general , but also it is a morphology that can be linked directly to the dynamics of barred galaxies .",
    "note that the classification shown in figures  [ olr_schematic ] and  [ olr_subclasses ] does not depend on whether the rings are in fact linked to the olr .",
    "the illustrated morphologies are abundant and easily recognized regardless of how they are interpreted .",
    "( section 10.1 discusses other interpretations that have been proposed . )",
    "although the schwarz models guided the search for these morphologies , rautiainen , salo , & buta ( 2004 ) and treuthardt et al .",
    "( 2008 ) showed that some outer pseudorings classified as r@xmath33 are more likely related to the outer 4:1 resonance and not the olr .",
    "these cases are generally recognizable by the presence of secondary spiral arcs in a four - armed pattern in the area of the bar ( ngc 1433 in figure  [ difftilts ] and eso 566@xmath3524 in figure  [ spiraltypes ] are examples ) .",
    "the olr subclassifications are used in the same manner as the plain outer ring and pseudoring classifications .",
    "for example , ngc 3081 has the full type ( r@xmath32r@xmath34)sab(r)0/a .",
    "the value of recognizing lenses as significant morphological components was first emphasized by kormendy ( 1979 ) , who suggested a dynamical link between inner lenses , which are often filled by a bar in one dimension , and dissolved or dissolving bars .",
    "kormendy noted that lenses can be of the inner or outer type , in a manner analogous to inner and outer rings .",
    "he suggested the notation ( l ) for inner lenses and ( l ) for outer lenses to be used in the same position of the classification as inner and outer rings . for example , the galaxy ngc 1543 is type ( r)sb(l)0/a while galaxy ngc 2983 is type ( l)sb(s)0@xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ lenses ] demonstrates the continuity between rings and lenses , which is evident not only among barred galaxies but among nonbarred ones as well .",
    "this continuity is recognized by the type symbol ( rl ) , also used by kormendy ( 1979 ) .",
    "this type refers to a low contrast inner ring at the edge of a clear lens .",
    "even underline classifications ( @xmath29l ) and ( r@xmath36 ) may be recognized .",
    "a rare classification , ( r@xmath31l ) , refers to an inner pseudoring / lens , a type of feature that is seen in ngc 4314 and recognized as such in the dva .",
    "similarly , figure  [ outer_lenses ] shows a continuity between outer rings and outer lenses through the type classification ( rl ) , referring to an outer lens with a weak ring - like enhancement .",
    "underline types @xmath37l and r@xmath38 may also be recognized .",
    "the origin of outer lenses could be in highly evolved outer rings .",
    "the central regions of barred galaxies often include distinct morphological features in the form of small rings and secondary bars .",
    "the rings , known as nuclear rings because of their proximity to the nucleus well inside the ends of the primary bar , are sites of some of the most spectacular starbursts known in normal galaxies .",
    "the rings are typically @xmath21.5 kpc in linear diameter and intrinsically circular in shape .",
    "figure  [ nrnb ] ( top row ) shows three examples : ngc 1097 , 3351 , and 4314 .",
    "these images highlight the small bulges that seem characteristic of nuclear - ringed barred galaxies .",
    "the three galaxies illustrated have types ranging from sa to sb , but based on the bulge size the types would be considerably later .",
    "for example , ngc 3351 has the bulge of an sd galaxy .",
    "comern et al .",
    "( 2010 ) carried out an extensive statistical study of nuclear ring radii , and identified a subclass known as  ultra - compact \" nuclear rings ( ucnrs ) .",

    "comern et al .",
    "showed that ucnrs are the low size tail of the global nuclear ring population .",

    "( 2010 ) were also able to derive a reliable estimate of the relative frequency of nuclear rings as 20%@xmath392% over the type range s0@xmath5 to sd , confirming with smaller error bars the previous result of knapen ( 2005 ) .",
    "assuming that nuclear rings are a normal part of galaxy evolution , these authors argue that the rings may survive for 2 - 3 gyr .",
    "interestingly , it was also found that 19%@xmath394% of nuclear rings occur in nonbarred galaxies , implying either that the rings may have formed when a bar was stronger ( evidence of bar evolution ) or that ovals or other mechanisms can lead to their formation .",
    "mazzuca et al .",
    "( 2009 ; see also knapen 2010 ) connect some of the properties of nuclear rings to the rate at which the rotation curve rises in the inner regions .",
    "the most extreme nuclear ring known is found in the sba galaxy eso 565@xmath3511 ( see also section 7 ) . at 3.5kpc in diameter , not only is it one of the largest known nuclear rings , but also the ring has an extreme elongated shape compared to more typical nuclear rings .",
    "nuclear bars lie in the same radial zone as nuclear rings and sometimes lie inside a nuclear ring .",
    "three examples are shown in the second row of figure  [ nrnb ] . these average about one - tenth the size of a primary bar .",
    "there is no preferred angle between the axis of the nuclear bar and the primary bar , suggesting that the two features have different pattern speeds ( buta & combes 1996 ; dva ) .",
    "neither nuclear rings nor nuclear bars were recognized in the original hubble - sandage - de vaucouleurs classifications , presumably in part because the use of small - scale photographic plates for extensive galaxy classification limited the detectability of the features in the ( typically ) overexposed centers .",

    "buta & combes ( 1996 ) and buta et al . (",

    "the type does not directly tell : ( 1 ) the multiplicity of the spiral pattern ; ( 2 ) the character of the arms ( massive , filamentary , grand design , or flocculent ) ; or ( 3 ) the sense of winding of the arms ( leading or trailing the direction of rotation ) .",
    "these are nevertheless additional dimensions to galaxy morphology .",
    "the multiplicity of the spiral pattern refers to the actual number of spiral arms , usually denoted by the integer @xmath40 .",

    "de vaucouleurs ( 1956 ) originally used these distinctions as part of his classification , but later dropped the references to spiral arm character probably because of the complexity it added to his types .",
    "elmegreen & elmegreen ( 1987 ) used a different approach to spiral arm character by recognizing a series of spiral _ arm classes _ based on arm continuity and length ( but not necessarily contrast ) .",
    "ten classes ranging from flocculent ( acs 1 - 4 ) to grand design ( 5 - 12 ; numbers 10 and 11 were later dropped ) .",
    "examples of each are illustrated in figure  [ arm_classes ] ( see elmegreen & elmegreen 1987 for a description of each class ) .",
    "thus , spiral character is a well - developed additional dimension to galaxy classification .",
    "a simpler approach advocated by elmegreen & elmegreen is  g \" for grand - design ,  f \" for flocculent , and  m \" for multiple - armed .",
    "the arms of grand design spirals are in general thought to be density waves and may in fact represent quasi - steady wave modes ( e.g. , bertin et al . 1989 ; zhang 1996 , 1998 , 1999 ) , although there is also some evidence that spirals may be transient ( see review by sellwood 2010 ) .",
    "flocculent spirals may be sheared self - propogating star formation regions ( seiden & gerola 1982 ) .",
    "figure  [ spiraltypes ] also shows two examples of a new class of spirals , called _",
    "counter - winding _ spirals . in these cases ,",
    "an inner spiral pattern winds outward in the opposite sense to an outer spiral pattern . in the case of ngc 4622 ( row 2 , middle ) , the inner pattern has only a single arm and the outer pattern has two arms , while in ngc 3124 ( row 2 , middle right ) , the inner pattern is two - armed while the outer pattern is at least four - armed .",
    "the two cases are very different because ngc 4622 is essentially nonbarred while in ngc 3124 , the inner spiral is classified as a bar .",
    "the presence of oppositely winding spiral patterns in the same galaxy means that one set of arms is trailing ( opening opposite the direction of rotation ) while the other set is leading ( opening into the direction of rotation ) . in general , studies of the dust distribution as well as the rotation of spirals has shown that trailing arms are the rule ( de vaucouleurs 1958 ) .",
    "surprisingly , straightforward analysis of a velocity field and the dust pattern in ngc 4622 led buta , byrd , & freeman ( 2003 ) to conclude that the strong outer two - armed pattern in this galaxy is leading , while the inner single arm is trailing .",
    "this led to the characterization of ngc 4622 as a  backwards spiral galaxy , \" apparently rotating the wrong way .",
    "an additional nonbarred counter - winding spiral has been identified in eso 297@xmath3527 by grouchy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . in this case",

    "( 2008 ) have shown that a two - armed ( but not counter - winding ) spiral in the strongly interacting galaxy iras 18293 - 3413 is leading .",
    "even with this , the number of known leading spirals is very small ( dva ) .",
    "leading spirals are not expected to be as long - lived as trailing spirals since they do not transfer angular momentum outwards and this is needed for the long - term maintenance of a spiral wave ( lynden - bell & kalnajs 1972 ) .",
    "an interesting example of leading  armlets \" was described by knapen et al .",
    "( 1995a ) , who used @xmath41-band imaging of the center of the grand design spiral m100 to reveal details of its nuclear bar and well - known nuclear ring / spiral .",
    "the nuclear bar has a leading twist that connects it to two bright @xmath41-band  knots \" of star formation .",
    "this morphology was interpreted in terms of the expectations of gas orbits in the vicinity of an inner inner lindblad resonance ( iilr ; knapen et al .",
    "1995b ) .",
    "the final galaxy in figure  [ spiraltypes ] is ngc 4921 , an example of an _ anemic _ spiral .",
    "this is a type of spiral that is deficient in neutral atomic hydrogen gas , and as a consequence it has a lower amount of dust and star formation activity .",
    "the arms of ngc 4921 resemble those of an sb or sbc galaxy in pitch angle and extensiveness , but are as smooth as those typically seen in sa galaxies .",
    "anemic spirals were first recognized as galaxies with  fuzzy \" arms ( see van den bergh 1998 ) where star formation has been suppressed due to ram - pressure stripping in the cluster environment . in the case of ngc 4921 ,",
    "the environment is the coma cluster .",
    "the idea is that such galaxies will eventually turn into s0 galaxies ( van den bergh 2009a ) .",

    "seigar et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have demonstrated the existence of a correlation between spiral arm pitch angles and supermassive central black hole masses .",
    "the sense of the correlation is such that black hole mass is highest for the most tightly wound spirals and lowest for the most open spirals .",
    "the correlation is expected because black hole mass is tightly correlated to bulge mass and central mass concentration , and spiral arm pitch angle is tied to shear in galactic disks , which itself depends on mass concentration ( seigar et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "luminosity effects are evident in the morphology of galaxies through surface brightness differences between giants and dwarfs , and through the sophistication of structure such as spiral arms .",
    "van den bergh ( 1998 ) describes his classification system which takes luminosity effects into account using a set of luminosity classes that are analogous to those used for stars .",
    "the largest , most massive spirals have long and well - developed arms , while less massive spirals have less well - defined arms .",
    "the nomenclature for the classes parallels that for stars : i ( supergiant galaxies ) , ii ( bright giant galaxies ) , iii ( giant galaxies ) , iv ( subgiant galaxies ) and v ( dwarf galaxies ) .",
    "intermediate cases i - ii , ii - iii , iii - iv , and iv - v , are also recognized .",
    "figure  [ lclasses ] shows galaxies which van den bergh ( 1998 ) considers primary luminosity standards of his classification system .",
    "the original van den bergh standards for these classes were based on the small scale paper prints of the palomar sky survey .",
    "sandage and tammann ( 1981 ) adopted the precepts of the van den bergh classes but revised the standards based on large - scale plates .",
    "in general , luminosity class i galaxies have the longest , most well - developed arms , luminosity class iii galaxies have short , patchy arms extending from the main body , while luminosity class v galaxies have very low surface brightness and only a hint of spiral structure .",
    "the classes are separated by type in figure  [ lclasses ] because among sb galaxies , few are of luminosity class iii or fainter , while among sc and later type galaxies , the full range of luminosity classes is found .",
    "van den bergh does not use types like sd or sm for conventional de vaucouleurs late - types , but instead uses s@xmath5 and s@xmath4 to denote  early \" ( smoother ) and  late \" ( more patchy ) subgiant spirals .",

    "also related to galactic dust distributions are observations of _ occulting galaxy pairs _ , where a foreground spiral galaxy partly occults a background galaxy , ideally an elliptical ( white & keel 1992 ) . with such pairs , one can estimate the optical depth of the foreground dust , often in areas where it might not be seen easily in an isolated spiral .",

    "kk04 argue that a low sersic index compared to @xmath16=4 appears to be the hallmark of these pseudobulges , and a signature of secular evolution .",

    "ngc 6782 and 3081 ( two left frames ) have secondary bars , and kk04 considered that such features indicate the presence of a pseudobulge because bars are always disk features . in each case",

    "however , boxy and box / peanut bulges would _ not _ necessarily be the result of slow movement of gas by bar torques , and subsequent star formation in the central regions , but instead would be related to the orbital structure of the bar itself ( athanassoula 2005 ) .",

    "the latter rings could be more frequent because their faintness may cause them to go undetected , which is less likely to occur for inner rings .",
    "as has been noted , nuclear rings are found at the 20% level ( comern et al .",
    "the high abundance of these types of ring features suggests that they are mainly products of _ internal _ dynamics , and in fact all three ring types have been interpreted in terms of internal processes in barred galaxies .",
    "the main interpretation of these kinds of rings has been in terms of orbital resonances with the pattern speed of a bar , oval , or spiral density wave .",
    "resonances are special places where a bar can secularly gather gas owing to the properties of periodic orbits ( buta & combes 1996 ) .",
    "buta ( 1995 ) showed that the intrinsic shapes and relative bar orientations of inner and outer rings and pseudorings supports the resonance interpretation of the features .",

    "regan and teuben ( 2003 , 2004 ) argue that nuclear rings and inner rings are better interpreted in terms of orbit transitions , that is , regions where periodic orbits transition from one major orbit family to another , as in the transition from the perpendicularly - aligned @xmath47 family to the bar - aligned @xmath48 family ( contopoulos & grosbol 1989 ) .",

    "one of these , ngc 4580 , is so unusual that sandage & bedke ( 1994 ) classify it as sc(s)/sa , where the sc part is the inner disk and the sa part is the outer disk . in ",
    "t / a galaxies \" , the inner star - formation is at a low level , as in anemic cases , while in  t / c \" galaxies , most of the star formation is confined within the inner 1 kpc .",
    "koopmann and kenney found that the majority of virgo cluster spiral galaxies have truncated star - forming disks .",
    "the idea is that the interstellar medium ( ism ) of a cluster galaxy can interact with the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , stripping the ism ( via ram pressure ; gunn and gott 1972 ) but leaving the stellar disk intact .",
    "truncated gas and star - forming disks result because ram - pressure stripping is more severe in the outer parts of galaxies ( e. g. , book and benson 2010 and references therein ) . in virgo ,",
    "most galaxies with truncated star - forming disks have relatively undisturbed stellar disks and normal to slightly enhanced inner disk star formation rates , suggesting that icm - ism stripping is the main mechanism in the reduction of their star formation rates .",
    "the cases found to have relatively normal or enhanced star formation rates are preferentially located in the outer parts of the cluster and likely have never visited the core region .",
    "only galaxies which go near the center get significantly stripped .",

    "several galaxies , including many of the t / c class , display peculiarities consistent with tidal effects , such as nonaxisymmetric circumnuclear star formation , shell features ( e.g. , ngc 4424 in figure  [ virgotypes ] ) , and enhanced inner star formation rates .",

    "three distinct morphologies of the distributions of these clouds were found : ( 1 ) connected clouds that blend with disk star formation ; ( 2 ) long , connected lines of clouds that extend from a central gas knot but are not related to the disk light ; and ( 3 ) clouds completely detached from the main disk .",
    "examples of these categories are illustrated in figure  [ coma ] .",
    "yagi et al . interpret them in terms of an evolutionary gas - stripping sequence where category ( 1 ) galaxies are in an earlier phase of stripping while the category ( 3 ) galaxies are in the most advanced phase .",
    "it is likely that large disk galaxies in coma would be completely stripped eventually because of the cluster s high icm density and broad velocity distribution .",
    "the same process seen in coma likely occurs in virgo but is only partial for the large spirals owing to the lower icm density and velocities in virgo ( koopmann & kenney 2004 ) .",
    "it is perhaps fitting that the first major spiral galaxy discovered was in the interacting pair m51 ( section 2 ) .",
    "numerical simulations ( salo & laurikainen 2000a , b ) have shown that both parabolic and bound passages of the companion , ngc 5195 , can explain the observed morphology and other characteristics of the system .",

    "the minor axis dust lane type appears most common , but cases of alignment along the major axis of the outer isophotes ( major axis dust lanes ) as well as cases of misalignment are also known ( see the upper left panels of figure  [ pec_es ] ) .",
    "the origin of these very regular dust lanes is thought to be a merger of a gas - rich companion ( e.g. , oosterloo et al .",

    "in fact , the first examples , ngc 1344 and 3923 , are classified in catalogues as ordinary ellipticals because the shells are not detectable on photographs of average depth .",
    "once the class was recognized , a detailed search led to other examples which were listed by malin & carter ( 1980 , 1983 ) .",

    "as shown by crocker , baugus , & buta ( 1996 ) , the distribution of hii regions around inner rings is sensitive to the intrinsic shape of the ring .",
    "when the ring is highly elongated , the hii regions concentrate around the ends of the major axis ( which coincide with the bar axis ; ngc 6782 ) , while when the ring is circular , the hii regions are more uniformly spread around the ring ( ngc 7329 ) .",
    "inner ring shapes do not correlate well with maximum relative bar torques in a galaxy ( dva ) , but grouchy et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have shown that when local forcing is considered instead , ring shapes and bar strengths are well - correlated .",
    "the case of ngc 7267 is different in that most of its h@xmath51 emission is concentrated in the bar .",

    "can be highly organized , well - defined patterns .",
    "recent high quality surveys have provided some of the best maps of these distributions in normal galaxies .",
    "atomic hydrogen is mapped with the 21 cm fine structure emission line , which has the advantage of not being affected by extinction and for being sufficiently optically thin in general to allow total hi masses to be derived directly from hi surface brightness maps .",
    "in addition , hi maps provide information on the kinematics and dynamics of the ism , as well on the existence and distribution of dark matter in galaxies .",
    "molecular hydrogen is generally mapped using the @xmath53co j=1 - 0 rotational transition at a wavelength of 2.6 mm , under the assumption that co and hydrogen mix in a roughly fixed proportion .",
    "although numerous maps have been made of the hi distribution in nearby galaxies , the most sophisticated and detailed survey made to date is the  the hi nearby galaxies survey \" ( things , walter et al .",
    "the earliest surveys had shown that hi is a tracer of spiral structure in galaxies , and the things provides some of the highest quality maps revealing this correlation as well as other characteristics . from a morphological point of view , hi maps tend to reveal : ( 1 ) enhanced surface brightness in star - forming features such as spiral arms , rings , and pseudorings ; ( 2 ) extended gaseous disks , such that the hi extent can exceed the optical extent by several times ; and ( 3 ) supernova - driven and star - formation driven , wind - blown holes .",

    "in m81 and m83 , the hi traces the optical spiral structure well .",
    "large rings or pseudorings are seen in ngc 2841 and ngc 4258 , while m81 shows an intermediate - scale ring of gas that is much less evident optically .",
    "the bright star - forming inner ring in ngc 4736 is well - defined and easily distinguished in hi , but the galaxy s diffuse stellar outer ring is more of an asymmetric spiral zone .",
    "most interesting in hi maps are the obvious holes where there appears to be a deficiency of neutral gas compared to surrounding regions .",
    "especially large holes are seen in the hi morphology of the late - type dwarf ddo 50 .",
    "these holes are thought to be regions cleared by the stellar winds and explosions of massive stars contained or once contained within them .",
    "the holes are 100pc to 2kpc in size , and have different systematic properties in early and late - type galaxies in the sense that holes may last longer in late - type dwarfs owing to the lack of serious shear due to strong differential rotation ( bagetakos et al . 2009 ) .",
    "holes may also be found outside the standard isophotal optical angular diameter .",
    "the dwarf galaxy ddo 154 shown in figure  [ himaps ] has one of the largest ratios of hi to optical diameter , a factor of 6 at least according to carignan & purton ( 1998 ) , who also estimated that 90% of the mass of the galaxy is in the form of dark matter . the hi and optical morphologies bear little resemblance to one another .",
    "another example of strongly uncorrelated hi and optical morphologies is ngc 2915 , a very gas - rich galaxy whose optical morphology is a blue compact dwarf while its at least 5 times larger hi morphology includes a prominent outer spiral with no optical counterpart ( meurer et al .",
    "1996 ) , leading to the concept of a purely  dark spiral . \"",
    "bertin & amorisco ( 2010 ) consider a general intepretation of such large outer hi spirals , especially those seen in galaxies like ngc 628 and ngc 6946 : the spirals represent short trailing waves that carry angular momentum outwards from corotation and , at least in the gaseous component , penetrate a normal barrier at the olr of the stellar disk pattern and go far out into the hi disk .",
    "the short trailing waves are thought to excite the global spiral arms seen in the main optical body of the galaxy ( where the prominent optical spirals of ngc 628 and ngc 6946 are found ) .",
    "how ngc 2915 fits into this picture is unclear since the main stellar body of this galaxy is not a grand - design spiral .",
    "galaxies whose hi disks do not extend much beyond the optical light distribution are also of interest .",
    "ngc 4736 in figure  [ himaps ] is an example .",
    "the large , nearby ringed barred spiral ngc 1433 was found by ryder et al .",

    "( 1998 ) showed that in the ringed , barred spiral ngc 5850 , neutral gas is concentrated in the inner ring and in the asymmetric outer arm pattern , with little or no emission detected outside this pattern .",
    "the asymmetry led higdon et al . to propose that ngc 5850 has possibly experienced a high speed collision with nearby ngc 5846 .    in galaxy clusters ,",
    "it is well - known that environmental effects can truncate an hi disk so that it is _ smaller _ than the optical disk light .",

    "ees04 suggest that chain galaxies are edge - on irregular galaxies that will evolve to late - type disk galaxies .",

    "a range of environmental densities was found , implying that environment alone is not sufficient to make a spiral red .",
    "a significantly higher bar fraction was found for red spirals as compared to blue spirals , which masters et al .",

    "a major philosophical aspect of galaxy zoo is the value of human visual interpretation of galaxy morphology .",
    "that is , the human eye can integrate the detail in an image more reliably than a computer program can , in spite of the latter s ability to classify numbers of galaxies well beyond the capability of a single individual .",

    "a similar philosophy to galaxy zoo was used by buta ( 1995 ) to compile the catalogue of southern ringed galaxies , and also by schawinski et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who visually classified 48,023 sdss galaxies to identify a significant - sized sample of early - type galaxies for a study of the connection between nuclear activity and star formation . in the latter study , visual interpretation was argued to be needed to avoid bias against star - forming early - type galaxies which would be excluded from color - selected samples .",
    "a major result of this study was the identification of a time sequence whereby an early - type galaxy has its star formation suppressed by nuclear activity , a manifestation of agn feedback .",
    "if interactions and mergers can have profound effects on galaxy morphology , then the morphology of _ isolated _ galaxies clearly is of great interest .",
    "such galaxies allow us to see how internal evolution alone affects morphology , i. e. , what pure  nature \" morphologies look like .",
    "karachentseva ( 1973 ) compiled a large catalogue ( the catalogue of isolated galaxies , or cig ) of 1050 isolated galaxies that has proven very useful for examining this issue . a galaxy of diameter @xmath97 is sugggested to be isolated if it has no comparable - sized companions of diameter @xmath98 between @xmath97/4 and 4@xmath97 within a distance of 20@xmath98 .",
    "verdes - montenegro et al .",

    ", the proportion rises to 82% .",
    "thus , an isolated galaxy sample is very spiral - rich .",

    "all of these look relatively normal , but it is interesting how nonbarred galaxies like ngc 2649 and 5622 ( upper left frames in figure  [ isolateds ] ) show such conspicuous global spirals , which argues that the spirals in these galaxies have not been excited by an interaction .",
    "durbala et al .",

    "elmegreen , elmegreen , & montenegro ( 1992 ) argued that in such morphologies , the @xmath40=3 pattern is driven internally by the @xmath40=2 pattern , and that three - armed patterns measure the time elapsed since an interaction .",
    "particularly interesting in the domain of color galaxy morphology are the various deep field surveys that have been at the heart of high redshift studies .",
    "the most recent is the hst wide field camera 3 early release science ( ers ) data ( windhorst et al .",

    "figure  [ ers ] shows a variety of interesting nearby as well as high @xmath1 morphologies , including some of those illustrated in figure  [ highz ] .",

    ", by visual inspection alone . for a small number of observers ,",
    "this has been done for as many as 14,000 galaxies by nair & abraham ( 2010 ) and 48,000 galaxies by schawinski et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , while for a large number of observers working in concert ( e.g. , the galaxy zoo project ) it has been done for a million galaxies . but",
    "critical to such ventures is the preparation of images for classification , and a need for a homogeneous , objective approach to very large numbers of galaxies .",
    "this has led to extensive application of automated methods for classifying galaxies .",
    "for example , nair & abraham ( 2010 ) visually classified galaxies into coded bins for the purpose of training an automatic classification algorithm .",
    "( the remainder of this part will be found in the printed publication . )",
    "the large number of illustrations in this article attests to the richness of the diversity of galaxy morphology .",
    "it is , of course , not possible to illustrate all aspects of morphology that might be worth discussing , but most interesting is how far _ physical galaxy morphology _ has come in the 35 years since allan sandage wrote his review of galaxy morphology in volume ix of _ stars and stellar systems_. galaxy morphology is no longer the purely descriptive subject it once used to be .",
    "internal perturbations such as bars are apparently capable of generating a great deal of the interesting structure we see in disk galaxies , and more theoretical and observational studies should elucidate this further .",
    "the impact of bars on morphology seems well understood , as summarized in detail by kk04 in their monumental review article on pseudobulges .",
    "bars redistribute angular momentum and reorganize gas clouds to flow into resonance regions and fuel star formation .",
    "the gathering of gas into resonance regions can drive the formation of rings , and indeed can also build up the central mass concentration to the point of bar destruction . even failing this , the pile - up of gas into the nuclear region can lead to the formation of a pseudobulge .",
    "the richness of barred galaxy morphology attests to the strong role secular evolution plays in structuring galaxies .",
    "progress in understanding the role of mergers and interactions on galaxy morphology has also proceeded at a rapid pace .",
    "great success in numerical simulations and the theory of interacting galaxies has made it possible to link a specific type of interaction to a specific morphology ( e. g. , collisional ring galaxies ) .",
    "the complex structure of early - type galaxies , with boxy and disky isophote shapes , shells and ripples , and other features , shows that interactions and mergers play an important role in molding galaxies ( see the excellent review by schweizer 1998 ) . with the advent of the hubble space telescope , this role has been elucidated even more clearly because the merger rate was higher in the past .    in spite of the theoretical progress , it is interesting that classical morphology has not lost its relevance or usefulness even after more than 80 years since hubble published his famous 1926 paper .",
    "no matter how much progress in understanding the physical basis for morphology is made , there is still a need for the ordering and insights provided by classical hubble - sandage - de vaucouleurs galaxy classifications .",
    "morphology went through a low phase in the 1980s and 90s when it was perceived that galaxy classification placed too much emphasis on unimportant details and was too descriptive to be useful .",
    "it was thought that the hubble classification had gone as far as it can go , and that another approach needed to be tried to build a more physical picture of galaxies . at that time",
    ", there was a sense that the focus should be more on the component  building blocks \" of galaxies , or what might be called galactic subsystems ( e.g. , djorgovski 1992 ) .",
    "quantification of morphology became more possible as advanced instrumentation allowed more detailed physical measurements to be made . in the end , as morphology became better understood , it also became clear what a type such as ",
    "( r)sb(r)ab \" might really mean , which enhanced the value of classification ( kk04 ) .",
    "in addition , numerical simulations became sophisticated enough to make predictions about morphology ( e.g. , the r@xmath32 and r@xmath100 subclasses of outer rings and pseudorings ) .",
    "these types of things , as well as the movement of morphology from the photographic domain to the digital imaging domain , the broadening of the wavelength coverage available to morphological studies from the optical to the ultraviolet and infrared domains , the sloan digital sky survey , and the accessiblity of high redshift galaxies to unprecedentedly detailed morphological study , all played a role in bringing galaxy morphology to the forefront of extragalactic research .",
    "even so , the writing of this article has shown that many important galaxies and classes of galaxies have not been studied well enough to have much modern data available .",
    "for example , in spite of the considerable interest in collisional ring galaxies the past 20 years or so , struck ( 2010 ) was forced to lament that ring galaxies  are underobserved . \"",
    "the same can be said for resonance ring galaxies , giant low surface brightness galaxies , dwarf spirals , magellanic barred spirals , counter - winding spirals , and other classes of interacting galaxies .",
    "the most that can be said about this is that further studies will likely be made , especially if instrumentation facilitates the objects in question .",
    "rotation and dynamics are far short of photometry for most classes of galaxies , but would add a great deal of insight if obtainable .    at the other extreme ,",
    "early - type ( e and s0 galaxies ) continue to be the focus of major photometric , kinematic , and theoretical research projects .",
    "important clues to the formation and evolution of such galaxies are contained in their intrinsic shapes ( oblate , prolate , triaxial ) , in the ages , metallicities , and radial mass - to - light ratios of their stellar populations , in their three - dimensional orbital structure , and in the kinematic peculiarities often found in such systems ( de zeeuw et al .",
    "2002 ) . among the most recent studies",
    "are the massive photometric analysis of early - types in the virgo cluster by kormendy et al .",

    "this survey is simply the latest part of the long - term effort by many researchers , beginning in the 1980s , to understand early - type galaxies in terms of quantitative parameters that can be tied to theoretical models .",
    "early - types have been a persistent enigma in morphological studies , and considerable evidence suggests that the e , s0 sequence as defined by hubble , sandage , and de vaucouleurs hides a great deal of important physics associated with these objects . the atlas@xmath101 project was designed to exploit the @xmath25 parameter described by emsellem et al .",

    "2010 and references therein ) , parameters that characterize the bulges , disks , bars , lenses , rings , and spiral patterns are being derived for large numbers of galaxies ( especially barred galaxies ) that were not reliably decomposable with earlier one - dimensional approaches .    for the future",
