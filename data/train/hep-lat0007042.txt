    "chiral symmetry in fermionic field theories on the lattice may be implemented by adding a non - vanishing and in the continuum limit irrelevant right hand side of the usual anti - commutator of the dirac operator @xmath0 with @xmath5 . in its simplest form",
    "the resulting so - called ginsparg - wilson equation @xcite reads ( we set the lattice spacing to 1 ) @xmath6 based on ( [ giwi ] ) chirally symmetric fermions can be constructed on the lattice ( for reviews of recent developments see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "currently two types of solutions for ( [ giwi ] ) are known .",
    "neuberger @xcite gave an explicit construction , the so - called overlap operator based on earlier work , the overlap approach to chiral fermions on the lattice @xcite .",
    "the overlap operator is given by @xmath7 here @xmath8 is some decent lattice dirac operator which is free of doublers .",
    "typically the wilson - dirac operator is used here but also other choices give rise to solutions of ( [ giwi ] ) ; @xmath9 is a real number which can , at the cost of an additional renormalization , be used to optimize the locality properties of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the main challenge when using the overlap operator is the computation of the square root in ( [ overlapd ] ) , making simulations with the overlap operator considerably more expensive than simulations with the wilson operator .",
    "the second solution to ( [ giwi ] ) is provided by the fixed point dirac operator @xcite which goes back to the perfect action approach to lattice field theories @xcite .",
    "so far , the fixed point dirac operator has been computed only in two dimensions @xcite and it has become clear that its construction in 4-d is quite a challenging enterprise .    recently @xcite a new line of attack for solving the ginsparg - wilson equation has been proposed . the basic idea is to systematically expand the most general lattice dirac operator @xmath0 in a series of simple basis operators on the lattice .",
    "this expanded @xmath0 is then inserted into the ginsparg - wilson equation .",
    "the product @xmath10 on the right hand side of ( [ giwi ] ) can be evaluated using techniques from the analytical hopping expansion .",
    "the result is an expansion of both sides of ( [ giwi ] ) ; comparing the factors in front of the contributions to this expansion one finds that the ginsparg - wilson equation is mapped to an equivalent system of coupled quadratic equations for the expansion coefficients of @xmath0 .",
    "when using finitely many terms in the expansion of @xmath0 , the system of equations for the expansion coefficients can be solved numerically and the corresponding @xmath0 is an approximate solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation . by including more terms in the expansion of @xmath0 the violation of ( [ giwi ] ) can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "here we present first results in 4-d for the discussed method .",
    "we explicitly construct an approximate solution @xmath0 of ( [ giwi ] ) and study its properties in different ensembles of quenched su(3 ) gauge configurations .",
    "we find that already with relatively few terms we obtain a good approximate solution for the ginsparg - wilson equation .",
    "we discuss properties of the spectrum of our dirac operator and also analyze the role of improving the gauge field action .",
    "we demonstrate that improving the gauge field action considerably improves the spectral properties of our @xmath0 .",
    "we would like to point out three aspects of our approximate solutions of the ginsparg - wilson equation :    * in an earlier study @xcite in two dimensions we had constructed an approximate solution of ( [ giwi ] ) using the outlined ideas .",
    "it turned out that essential features of chiral symmetry in the lattice schwinger model were properly described by our approximate solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation .",
    "it will be interesting to see if our @xmath0 is able to capture chiral symmetry also in four dimensions . *",
    "our study should help to shed light on the importance of different terms in solutions @xmath0 of the ginsparg - wilson equation .",
    "in particular for the perfect action program an economical but still rich enough parametrization of @xmath0 is essential @xcite . *",
    "another application of our @xmath0 is its use as a starting operator @xmath8 in neuberger s construction . using an approximate solution of ( [ giwi ] ) in the projection ( [ overlapd ] )",
    "has been proposed previously @xcite and it is believed that an improved @xmath8 speeds up the evaluation of the square root and helps to overcome the problems with the potential singularity of ( [ overlapd ] ) for small eigenvalues of @xmath11 .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly discuss the expansion of @xmath0 and derive the system of equations equivalent to the ginsparg - wilson equation .",
    "we discuss in section 3 the boundary conditions and find a solution of the system of coupled equations . in section 4",
    "we analyze the spectral properties of our approximate solution d for ensembles of quenched gauge field configurations .",
    "we start with the free case in section 4.1 followed by gauge field ensembles generated with the standard wilson gauge action ( section 4.2 ) .",
    "finally in section 4.3 we investigate how improving the gauge field action can further improve the chiral properties of the lattice dirac operator .",
    "the article closes with a discussion in section 5 .",
    "in particular we will come back to the above mentioned three possible applications of our dirac operator .",
    "to make the article self contained we briefly repeat the basic idea of our construction presented in @xcite . in a first step we discuss the systematic expansion of the most general euclidean dirac operator in a series of simple operators on the lattice .",
    "subsequently we derive the system of quadratic equations for the expansion coefficients which is equivalent to the ginsparg - wilson equation .",
    "typically the derivative term on the lattice is discretized by the following nearest neighbor term ( we set the lattice spacing to 1 ) : @xmath12 \\ ; . \\label{example1}\\ ] ] however , it is perfectly compatible with all the symmetries to instead discretize the derivative term using @xmath13 , \\label{example2}\\ ] ] and there are many more terms one could think of .",
    "thus an ansatz for the most general dirac operator @xmath0 must allow for a superposition of all of the possible discretizations for the derivative term .",
    "the terms in ( [ example1 ] ) and ( [ example2 ] ) can be characterized by simple paths on the lattice .",
    "the first example ( [ example1 ] ) consists of a single hop in positive @xmath14-direction with a plus sign and a single hop in negative direction with a minus sign .",
    "similarly the second example consists of two hops in positive ( negative ) @xmath14-direction .",
    "we now introduce a shorthand notation for such paths using an ordered list of the directions of the links of the path .",
    "we denote a path of length @xmath15 on the lattice by @xmath16 with the @xmath17 giving the directions of the subsequent hops , i.e.  @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "it is implicitly understood , that each link is dressed with the corresponding link variable @xmath20 . using this notation the terms from the two examples",
    "( [ example1 ] ) and ( [ example2 ] ) are denoted as @xmath21 and @xmath22 we use the abbreviation @xmath23 for sign@xmath24 .",
    "due to translation invariance the form of the derivative terms , and thus of the paths , is the same at all lattice points such that in our notation no reference to the starting point for the paths is necessary .    in order to remove the doublers",
    "one also needs a term which in momentum space can distinguish between @xmath25 ( physical modes ) and @xmath26 ( doublers ) .",
    "such a term is provided by the standard wilson term . due to the symmetries this term has to come with 1i in spinor space .",
    "again we will allow for all possible terms .",
    "we generalize our @xmath0 further , by including all terms also for the remaining elements @xmath27 of the clifford algebra , i.e.  tensors , pseudovectors and the pseudoscalar .",
    "thus the emerging lattice dirac operator has the following form : @xmath28 to each generator @xmath27 of the clifford algebra we assign a set @xmath29 of paths @xmath30 , each @xmath30 given by some ordered set of links @xmath31 ( compare ( [ notation ] ) ) where @xmath32 denotes the length of the path @xmath30 . each path is weighted with some complex weight @xmath33 .",
    "the next step is to impose on @xmath0 the symmetries which we want to maintain : translation and rotation invariance and invariance under c and p. in addition we require our @xmath0 to be @xmath5-hermitian , i.e.  we require @xmath34 .",
    "this property can be seen to correspond to what leads to the cpt theorem in minkowski space , i.e.  the vector generators @xmath35 come with a derivative term etc .",
    "translation invariance has already been briefly mentioned above and requires the sets @xmath29 of paths and their coefficients to be independent of the starting point .",
    "rotation invariance implies that a path and its rotated image have the same weight .",
    "parity implies that for each path @xmath30 ( with coefficient @xmath33 ) we must include the parity - reflected copy with coefficient @xmath36 where the signs @xmath37 are defined by @xmath38 .    of importance",
    "are the symmetries c and @xmath5-hermiticity .",
    "it is easy to see that both of them imply a relation between the coefficient for a path @xmath30 and the coefficient of the inverse path @xmath39 .",
    "implementing both these symmetries restricts all coefficients @xmath33 to be either real or purely imaginary .",
    "furthermore we find that the coefficient for a path @xmath30 and the coefficient for its inverse @xmath39 are equal up to a sign @xmath40 defined by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denotes transposition and @xmath43 is the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "when implementing all these symmetries we find that paths in our ansatz become grouped together where  up to sign factors  all paths in a group come with the same coefficient .",
    "we can now write down our most general dirac operator on the lattice in the form ( compare @xcite and see also @xcite for an equivalent derivation using a slightly different notation ) : @xmath44   \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\sum_{\\mu } \\gamma_\\mu \\sum_{l_1 = \\pm \\mu } s(l_1 ) \\big [ \\ ; v_1\\ ! < l_1 > \\ ; + \\ ; v_2\\!\\sum_{l_2 \\neq \\pm \\mu } [ < l_1,l_2 > + <",

    "we choose the normalization of the elements of the clifford algebra such that the elements appear as all possible products of the @xmath35 without any extra factors of @xmath46 . for this normalization the symmetries",
    "c and @xmath5-hermiticity render all coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath48 real . to be specific , we use the euclidean chiral representation for the @xmath49 . in principle",
    "it would be possible to generalize @xmath0 further by multiplying each term with a polynomial of traces of gauge field variables around closed loops on the lattice , but we do not include this possibility here .",
    "the above mentioned structure of paths appearing in groups is obvious .",
    "the paths in each group are related by symmetries and up to the sign factors have to come with the same real coefficient .",
    "all paths within a group have the same length .",
    "it has to be stressed , that in ( [ dexp ] ) for each generator we show only the leading terms of an infinite series of groups of paths .",
    "the dots indicate that we omitted groups with paths that are longer than the terms we display .",
    "it is known @xcite that no ultra - local solutions of the ginsparg - wilson equation exist and thus an expansion for a solution of ( [ giwi ] ) necessarily contains infinitely many terms .",
    "eventually we will work with a finite @xmath0 ( the corresponding truncation will be discussed in section 3 ) but for the moment we keep deriving the method in its most general form , i.e.  containing no truncation .",
    "let us now insert our expanded dirac operator @xmath0 into the ginsparg - wilson equation . to that purpose",
    "we multiply ( [ giwi ] ) with @xmath5 from the left , bring the terms linear in @xmath0 to the right - hand side and define : @xmath50 we remark that @xmath51 is hermitian since we implemented @xmath5-hermiticity for @xmath0 .",
    "finding a solution @xmath0 of the ginsparg - wilson equation corresponds to having @xmath52 .",
    "evaluating the linear part of @xmath51 is straightforward : when evaluating the product @xmath53 we find that the terms with an odd number of @xmath35 , i.e.  vector- and pseudovector terms pick up a minus sign , while the other terms remain unchanged .",
    "thus when adding the two linear terms we find that the terms with an odd number of @xmath35 cancel , while the other terms pick up a factor of 2 .    the next step is to compute the quadratic term @xmath54 .",
    "here we have to multiply the various terms appearing in @xmath0 .",
    "each term is made out of two parts , a generator of the clifford algebra and a group of paths .",
    "the multiplication of two of these terms proceeds in two steps : first the two elements of the clifford algebra are multiplied giving again an element of the algebra . in the second step we have to multiply the paths of our two terms .",
    "this multiplication can be noted very conveniently in our notation , where multiplication of two paths simply consists of writing the paths into one long path : @xmath55 it is straightforward to establish this rule by translating back to the algebraic expression of our examples ( [ example1]),([example2 ] ) and performing the multiplication in this notation .",
    "it can happen that after multiplying two paths a hop in some direction @xmath17 is immediately followed by its inverse @xmath56 .",
    "these two hops then cancel each other and we find @xmath57 this rule is used to reduce all products of paths appearing in @xmath58 to their true length . in a final step",
    "we decompose the product terms into groups related by the symmetries in the same way as we did above when constructing the most general ansatz for @xmath0 .",
    "adding the linear and quadratic terms of ( [ edef ] ) we end up with the following expansion for @xmath51 : @xmath59   \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\sum_{\\mu } \\gamma_\\mu \\sum_{l_1 = \\pm \\mu } s(l_1 ) \\big [ \\ ; e^v_1\\!\\sum_{l_2 \\neq \\pm \\mu } [ < l_1,l_2 > - < l_2,l_1 > ]   \\ ; ... \\ ;",

    "\\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eexp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we remark that all the algebraic steps leading to the expansion of @xmath51 are straightforward to formalize and for the higher orders in the expansion we used a computer program . as for @xmath0 ,",
    "the expansion of @xmath51 is an infinite series and we display here only the leading groups of paths .",
    "the coefficients @xmath60 are now quadratic polynomials in the original coefficients @xmath61 and @xmath48 given by @xmath62 due to different symmetry properties ( @xmath51 is hermitian , @xmath0 is @xmath5-hermitian ) there are terms in @xmath51 which do not occur in @xmath0 and vice versa .",
    "each coefficient itself is an infinite series of terms .",
    "for a solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation we must have @xmath52 .",
    "it is easy to see , that the groups of paths appearing in the expansion ( [ eexp ] ) are linearly independent and hence for @xmath52 all coefficients @xmath60 have to vanish simultaneously .",
    "thus we have rewritten the problem of finding a solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation to solving the system ( [ qsyst ] ) of coupled quadratic equations ( set all right - hand sides @xmath63 ) .",
    "in the last section we have shown that the ginsparg - wilson equation is equivalent to a system of coupled quadratic equations for the expansion coefficients of @xmath0 . in this section",
    "we now truncate our expansion of @xmath0 and find solutions for the coupled equations . before we do this",
    "let us discuss the boundary conditions which have to be added to the system ( [ qsyst ] ) .      for the free case the situation is simple : in this case we can compute the fourier transform @xmath64 of @xmath0 . for small momenta the massless dirac operator should obey @xmath65 this leads to two more supplementary equations for the coefficients , one for the constant term to vanish and the second one sets the slope of the dispersion relation equal to one : @xmath66 we remark , that ( [ freedbc1 ] ) is implicitly guaranteed by the ginsparg - wilson equation , since the ginsparg - wilson circle - hermitian solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation has its spectrum on the so - called ginsparg - wilson circle , i.e.  the circle of radius 1 with center 1 in the complex plane .",
    "] runs through the origin .",
    "when we construct approximate solutions below it will be necessary to explicitly implement ( [ freedbc1 ] ) . when we started to solve the system of equations ( [ qsyst ] ) respecting the boundary conditions ( [ freedbc1 ] ) , ( [ freedbc2 ] ) we found , that for this setting one has to include a relatively large number of terms in the expansion ( [ dexp ] ) of @xmath0 . since every new term in @xmath0 drives up the cost of a numerical treatment of our dirac operator we decided to allow for an additional freedom in our equations .",
    "the idea is to allow some @xmath67-dependence by introducing a new parameter , similar in spirit to the variable @xmath9 in the overlap construction ( [ overlapd ] ) , which may be used to improve locality of @xmath0 , i.e.  to make higher terms in the expansion ( [ dexp ] ) of @xmath0 less important . at the same time we do not want to change our coupled equations ( [ qsyst ] ) since they guarantee that  up to a certain order ",
    "we deal with a solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation .",
    "thus we only modify the boundary conditions ( [ freedbc1 ] ) , ( [ freedbc2 ] ) .    before we discuss the modifications let us first develop the idea for the case of the standard wilson action .",
    "wilson s lattice dirac operator @xmath68 is a sum of a constant and a hopping term @xmath69 @xmath70 \\ ; u_\\mu(x ) \\ ;    \\delta_{x+\\mu , y } +   [ 1 + \\gamma_\\mu ] \\ ; u_\\mu(x-\\mu)^{-1 } \\delta_{x-\\mu , y } \\big\\ } \\ ; .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ \\label{dwil}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the free case the fourier transform of the hopping matrix is given by @xmath71 .",
    "thus the boundary condition corresponding to ( [ dfour ] ) reads @xmath72 and from this equation one finds that for the free case the correct value of the parameter is given by @xmath73 .",
    "in fact , in the notation of our parametrization of @xmath0 we have @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 with all other coefficients vanishing .",
    "the condition ( [ freewibc ] ) for the wilson operator therefore corresponds to both our boundary conditions ( [ freedbc1 ] ) and ( [ freedbc2 ] ) . in principle",
    "one could generalize the wilson action and lift the degeneracy between @xmath77 and @xmath78 which would amount to two boundary conditions similar to ( [ freedbc1 ] ) , ( [ freedbc2 ] ) instead of the single condition ( [ freewibc ] ) .",
    "the situation changes when we include gauge fields .",
    "one finds that in order to drive the system critical one needs to change the value of @xmath79 .",
    "e.g.  when analyzing quenched su(3 ) gauge theory at @xmath80 one finds @xmath81 ( see below ) .",
    "obviously this value of kappa is not a solution of the boundary condition ( [ freewibc ] ) but instead solves the more general equation @xmath82 here @xmath83 is a real function of @xmath67 . for quenched gauge fields at @xmath84",
    ", we find e.g. @xmath85 .",
    "we now generalize the boundary conditions ( [ freedbc1 ] ) , ( [ freedbc2 ] ) analogous to ( [ genwibc ] ) being a generalization of ( [ freewibc ] ) . in the boundary condition",
    "we multiply each coefficient by a power @xmath86 of some real , @xmath67-dependent number @xmath83 .",
    "the exponent @xmath15 is given by the number of hops of the corresponding term in our expansion ( [ dexp ] ) .",
    "thus e.g.  the coefficient @xmath87 , which is the constant term , does not get changed at all , @xmath88 which is the coefficient for the single hop obtains a factor of @xmath83 , @xmath89 which corresponds to two hops becomes multiplied by @xmath90 et cetera .",
    "we allow for two different coefficients @xmath91 and @xmath92 in the scalar and vector sectors .",
    "our generalized boundary conditions then read @xmath93 the two parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 can be used to optimize the properties of @xmath0 while at the same time maintaining unchanged the equations ( [ qsyst ] ) which are equivalent to the ginsparg - wilson equation .",
    "we emphasize , that these two supplementary conditions are just a practical means to effectively reduce the number of necessary terms in the dirac operator . in some sense",
    "they serve as a guiding principle to select more local actions in the huge space of possible actions satisfying the ginsparg - wilson condition .",
    "we can now restrict ourselves to a much smaller set of terms in the expansion ( [ dexp ] ) of @xmath0 .",
    "once this set is chosen , @xmath91 and @xmath92 will be determined by optimizing the properties of the spectrum of @xmath0 near the origin .",
    "the parameter @xmath91 is fixed by the requirement that the small eigenvalues of @xmath0 fall on the ginsparg - wilson circle ( i.e. @xmath96 ) ;  @xmath92 can e.g.  be fixed by requiring the slope of the @xmath97-dispersion relation to be equal to 1 .",
    "in this preliminary study we will simply determine @xmath92 by optimizing the alignment of larger eigenvalues along the circle .",
    "it is important to remark , that already including only a few terms in the expansion ( [ dexp ] ) of @xmath0 and solving the corresponding system ( [ qsyst ] ) considerably orders the small eigenvalues of @xmath0 ( see below ) .",
    "thus no complicated fine - tuning procedure is necessary for @xmath91 and @xmath92 and they can simply be determined by analyzing the spectrum of @xmath0 on a few background gauge field configurations .    finally we remark , that another feature which one would like to implement is @xmath98 improvement @xcite .",
    "it is known , that an exact solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation is already @xmath98 improved .",
    "however , here we will discuss only an approximate solution and it is useful to require @xmath98 improvement independently of the ginsparg - wilson equation . @xmath98 improvement may be achieved by adding to @xmath0 the so - called clover - leaf term @xmath99 @xcite . at tree level",
    "the coefficient @xmath100 equals the factor in front of the laplace - type contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "for non - perturbative improvement @xmath100 can e.g.  be determined using the schrdinger functional @xcite . since we do not attempt to determine @xmath100 non - perturbatively here we quote the condition at tree level ( i.e.  @xmath101 ) .",
    "it is obtained by expanding the terms in the tensor sector of our @xmath0 for small lattice spacing , extracting their @xmath102 content and setting the factor in front of this term equal to the factor of the laplace - term contribution of @xmath0 .",
    "one finds ( compare also @xcite ) @xmath103 it is straightforward to include @xmath100 as a free parameter in ( [ improve ] ) but as already remarked above we do not attempt a nonperturbative evaluation of @xmath100 here and thus work with the tree level equation ( [ improve ] ) throughout this paper .    at this point",
    "we would like to comment on the fate of the doubler modes .",
    "when analyzing our solutions for the free case we always find that the eigenvalues for the doublers ( at least one component @xmath104 of the four - momentum equals @xmath97 ) are located near 2 in the complex plane as is the case for exact , doubler - free solutions of the ginsparg - wilson equation .",
    "thus our approximation scheme already takes care of the doublers and we do not need to supplement the boundary condition ( [ dfour ] ) by an additional equation for the doublers .      in the last section the set of equations ( [ qsyst ] ) together with the boundary conditions ( [ rendbc ] ) and ( [ improve ] ) was discussed . in principle the system ( [ qsyst ] ) contains infinitely many equations , each of them with infinitely many terms . also the boundary conditions contain infinitely many terms .",
    "the next step thus will be a truncation of the expansion ( [ dexp ] ) for @xmath0 which will reduce the infinite problem to a finite problem .",
    "any reasonable truncation should have a parameter which controls the size of the remainder of the approximation . in our case",
    "such a parameter is given by the length of the paths in each term in the expansion ( [ dexp ] ) of @xmath0 .",
    "we find that roughly the size of the coefficients @xmath105 decreases exponentially as the length of the paths in the corresponding terms increases ( compare table [ coeffvals ] in the appendix ) . thus neglecting terms with longer paths provides a natural cutoff scheme for the expansion of @xmath0 .",
    "the exponential decrease of the coefficients not only justifies our cutoff , but is also important for the physics described by @xmath0 .",
    "a solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation can not be ultra - local @xcite .",
    "however , in order to remain in the correct universality class , @xmath0 has to be local , i.e.  @xmath106 has to decrease exponentially as the distance @xmath107 on the lattice increases . in fig .",
    "[ coefflog ] we plot the size of the coefficients as a function of @xmath108 on a logarithmic scale .",
    "we show the coefficients for the free case ( full circles are used to represent all the coefficients ) as well as those used for the quenched gauge field ensemble ( triangles ) from the wilson gauge action at @xmath80 ( cf .",
    "table [ coeffvals ] ) .",
    "the coefficients for the other three ensembles show a similar behavior .",
    "the size of the coefficients is consistent with being bound by an exponential decay with @xmath107 .",
    "thus we have verified , that we approximate a healthy , local solution of ( [ giwi ] ) .",
    "let us now come to the more practical aspects of the truncation .",
    "it is clear that adding more terms in the expansion ( [ dexp ] ) of @xmath0 improves the quality of the approximation of a solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation . on the other hand each new term drives up the numerical cost . here",
    "we present an operator which manages to give a decent approximation of a solution of ( [ giwi ] ) but at the same time is still relatively cheap to simulate .",
    "when constructing the operator we started with a simple parametrization and added only terms which gave rise to a considerable improvement of the spectral properties .",
    "we stopped adding terms when our @xmath0 had a satisfactory balance of good chiral properties and low numerical cost .",
    "also the choice of equations from the set ( [ qsyst ] ) allows for some freedom ( the boundary conditions ( [ rendbc ] ) and ( [ improve ] ) are always implemented ) .",
    "this freedom again goes back to the non - existence @xcite of ultra - local solutions of ( [ giwi ] ) .",
    "if we could solve all equations ( [ qsyst ] ) for a finite parametrization ( [ dexp ] ) of @xmath0 this would , however , amount to an ultra - local solution .",
    "the loophole out of this dilemma is the fact that the system ( [ qsyst ] ) is always overdetermined .",
    "thus we can only solve the equations corresponding to the leading terms of the expansion ( [ eexp ] ) of @xmath51 , where again the length of the paths is the expansion parameter .",
    "the solution which we present here has altogether 17 terms in the expansion ( [ dexp ] ) of @xmath0 .",
    "the maximum path length is 4 and we only included terms in the scalar , vector and tensor sectors . except for one term ( @xmath109 ) all terms have paths on the hypercube . for the vector and tensor sectors we allowed only terms up to length 3 on the hypercube , since longer terms in these sectors create many new entries in the fermion matrix which quickly increase the numerical cost .",
    "a detailed description of the terms used in our @xmath0 and the values of the coefficients are given in the appendix in table [ terms ] and table [ coeffvals ] .",
    "besides the three boundary conditions ( [ rendbc ] ) , ( [ improve ] ) we implement 14 equations from the system ( [ qsyst ] ) to match the number of expansion coefficients ( 17 ) .",
    "these equations correspond to the shortest terms with paths on the hypercube contributing to the expansion ( [ eexp ] ) of @xmath51 .",
    "we remark , that it was straightforward to exactly solve the equations ( [ qsyst ] ) , ( [ rendbc ] ) , ( [ improve ] ) with a standard solver @xcite and we also found that the system is very stable , i.e.  we found only a single solution for our setting .",
    "in this section we analyze the properties of our dirac operator for different ensembles of background gauge fields .",
    "we start with the analysis of the free case , followed by a study using quenched su(3 ) configurations generated with the standard wilson action for the gauge fields .",
    "we conclude with analyzing gauge fields from the improved lscher - weisz action .      for the free case it is possible to completely diagonalize the dirac operator using fourier transformation . in fig",
    "[ freespec ] we show the free spectrum of our @xmath0 in the complex plane .",
    "in addition to the eigenvalues ( symbols ) we also show the ginsparg - wilson circle ( full curve ) which supports the spectrum of any exact solution of ( [ giwi ] ) . throughout this article",
    "we present our spectra for @xmath110 lattices .",
    "this is a relatively small volume for usual standards , however , the dirac operator studied here is ultralocal and its extent is well within the lattice size .",
    "let us briefly discuss some features of the free spectrum .",
    "it is obvious , that our approach optimizes the alignment of the eigenvalues along the circle for the eigenvalues in the physical branch , i.e.  the eigenvalues in the vicinity of the origin .",
    "the alignment of the eigenvalues in the doubler branches is less perfect .",
    "the important feature , however , is the clear separation of the doubler modes and the physical eigenvalues .",
    "we furthermore found , that adding additional terms in ( [ dexp ] ) systematically improves the situation also for the doublers .",
    "this property of our approach of first optimizing the physical branch and aligning the doubler modes along the circle when adding higher terms persists also when analyzing the spectrum for non - trivial background gauge fields and was observed also for the 2-d case @xcite .",
    "at this point it is interesting to compare our method to the study of truncated perfect actions for free fermions @xcite . for free fermions",
    "the perfect action can be computed explicitly @xcite as an infinite series and is a solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation .",
    "after truncation to e.g.  only terms on the hypercube the result is an approximate solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation for the free case .",
    "this truncated perfect action will however differ from our approach in two important aspects : firstly actions for free fermions only contain scalar and vector terms .",
    "terms in the tensor , pseudovector and pseudoscalar sectors vanish identically when no gauge field is coupled .",
    "thus e.g.  terms in the tensor sector which are necessary for @xmath98 improvement and also play an important role for a smooth spectrum in the physical branch @xcite have to be included a posteriori .",
    "secondly for each possible endpoint of a fermion path the truncated perfect action for free fermions provides only a single coefficient . on the other hand , our symmetry analysis ( compare ( [ dexp ] ) ) shows , that different paths leading to this endpoint can come with different coefficients .",
    "thus the distribution of the single coefficient of the free perfect action among the various coefficients allowed by the exact symmetry analysis is an additional task .    overcoming these problems ,",
    "bietenholz @xcite presented interesting results for an approximate solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation in 4-d .",
    "after introducing fat links and a link amplification factor for the coefficients of the paths , an approximate solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation also for the case with gauge fields is obtained from the truncated perfect action .",
    "it is interesting to note that the spectra presented in @xcite show a behavior quite contrary to the spectra for our @xmath0 : they come with a very smooth doubler branch while the modes in the physical branch have quite large fluctuations .",
    "bietenholz expresses confidence that the physical branch can be smoothened by adding tensor terms but expects that these terms will at the same time destroy the good alignment of the eigenvalues in the doubler branch @xcite .",
    "[ [ results - for - quenched - gauge - configurations - generated - with - the - wilson - gauge - action ] ] results for quenched gauge configurations generated with the wilson gauge action ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    after having studied the properties of our @xmath0 for the free case we are now analyzing the dirac operator in ensembles of quenched su(3 ) gauge field configurations .",
    "we concentrate on the branch of the spectrum near small eigenvalues , which is the one most relevant in the continuum limit .",
    "we compute the eigenvalues in this physical branch of the spectrum and compare them with the eigenvalues for the wilson operator ( [ dwil ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath79 used for the wilson operator ( [ dwil ] ) can be found in table  [ rundat ] and will be discussed below .",
    "for the case of non - trivial background gauge fields the dirac operator can no longer be diagonalized completely unless one uses very small lattices . here",
    "we use the implicitly restarted arnoldi method @xcite to compute eigenvalues in the physical branch of the spectrum , i.e.  near the origin .",
    "the method allows to specify a search criterion for the eigenvalues and we use this feature to compute the eigenvalues with the smallest real parts .",
    "in order to get insight into the typical behavior of the spectrum of our @xmath0 , we analyzed the eigenvalues on 4 ensembles of quenched gauge fields .",
    "each ensemble consists of 20 well decorrelated configurations .",
    "two of the ensembles were generated with the standard wilson action at @xmath80 and @xmath111 .",
    "they will be discussed in this subsection .",
    "the other two ensembles were generated using the improved lscher - weisz action @xcite and will be analyzed in the next subsection . for each gauge field configuration",
    "we computed 60 eigenvalues in the physical branch for both our dirac operator as well as for the wilson - dirac operator .",
    "for the plots in fig .",
    "[ spectraw ] and fig .",
    "[ spectralw ] we increased the number of computed eigenvalues to 200 .",
    "all these calculations were done on @xmath110 lattices with anti - periodic boundary conditions for the dirac operator .    in fig .",
    "[ spectraw ] we show the physical branch of the spectrum of our operator for quenched gauge field configurations generated with the standard wilson gauge action at @xmath80 and @xmath111 .",
    "we compare these spectra with the spectra of the wilson - dirac operator on the same configurations .",
    "the symbols are the numerically computed eigenvalues and the full curve is the ginsparg - wilson circle .",
    "it is obvious , that for our @xmath0 the eigenvalues are more ordered than for wilson s @xmath0 for both @xmath80 and @xmath111 .",
    "the spread of the eigenvalues of our @xmath0 is reduced when compared to the wilson case and the eigenvalues tend to order near a curve .",
    "however , what is also obvious is the fact that although this curve touches the origin , it also bends away from the ginsparg - wilson circle as the size of the imaginary parts increases .",
    "as can be seen from the fourier transform in the free case , it is essentially the vector terms in the expansion ( [ dexp ] ) contributing to the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues . as we have already remarked above , we allowed only for a relatively small number of vector terms ( compare table [ terms ] ) in order to reduce the numerical cost .",
    "we thus attribute the bending away of the eigenvalues to this reduced approximation of the vector sector . in the next section we will",
    ", however , demonstrate , that our parametrization of the vector sector is sufficient if one uses improved gauge field actions .",
    "it is also interesting to study the behavior of the real eigenmodes  the @xmath111 part of fig .",
    "[ spectraw ] shows one real eigenvalue .",
    "typically the fluctuations of the real eigenvalues of the wilson - dirac operator are relatively large .",
    "in particular for so - called exceptional configurations ( in the sense of a breakdown of the matrix inversion ) a real mode has fluctuated so heavily towards small values that it compensates for the bare quark mass and the resulting zero mode leads to a breakdown of the matrix inversion . we found , and fig .",
    "[ spectraw ] shows an example , that our @xmath0 strongly suppresses the fluctuations of the real modes and turns them into almost perfect zero modes .",
    "we thus expect that at nonzero bare quark mass our @xmath0 considerably reduces the numerical difficulties with exceptional configurations .",
    "let us now discuss the overall fluctuation of the rest of the physical branch of the spectrum .",
    "an exact solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation has its spectrum on the ginsparg - wilson circle and only the density of eigenvalues on this circle will fluctuate .",
    "the eigenvalues of the wilson - dirac operator , on the other hand , have relatively large fluctuations in all directions .",
    "when analyzing the ensemble of 20 configurations for both @xmath80 and @xmath112 we found that for our @xmath0 the fluctuations of the physical edge of the spectrum are considerably suppressed when compared to the wilson - dirac operator .",
    "in order to quantify this statement we fit a circle of the form @xmath113 to the 10 smallest eigenvalues in the physical branch omitting the exactly real eigenvalues , because they deviate significantly in the case of the wilson operator ( compare above ) .",
    "( [ circle ] ) describes a circle of radius 1 around @xmath114 in the complex plane .",
    "the parameter @xmath115 of the fit gives the position where the circle crosses the real axis .",
    "the fluctuation of @xmath115 provides a measure for the fluctuation of the eigenvalues in the physical branch of the spectrum .    in fig .",
    "[ physedgew ] we show for each of our ensembles a histogram of the values of @xmath115 for all 20 configurations , comparing the results for our dirac operator with those for wilson s @xmath0 .",
    "it can be seen , that our @xmath0 has considerably reduced the fluctuations of the physical edge of the spectrum , in particular for @xmath80 .    at this point",
    "we can also comment on the determination of the critical @xmath79 for the wilson - dirac operator ( [ dwil ] ) . since the first term is proportional to the unit matrix , it is sufficient to diagonalize the hopping matrix @xmath69 .",
    "the value of @xmath79 was then adjusted such that the distribution of @xmath115 is centered at 0 .",
    "the values of @xmath79 obtained for our 4 ensembles are given in table [ rundat ] below .",
    "in this section we discuss the effect of improving the gauge field on the spectral properties of the dirac operator . in the context of domain wall fermions",
    "it has been found that improving the gauge field action allows to work with a smaller extension of the 5-th direction @xcite . also for the 4-d setting it",
    "is worth testing if improving the gauge field action leads to an improvement of the spectral properties of @xmath0 in particular since from a numerical point of view improving the gauge action is an inexpensive measure .",
    ".parameters for our ensembles of quenched gauge field configurations and the free case .",
    "we list the expectation value @xmath116 of the plaquette and the critical @xmath79 we use for the wilson operator .",
