    "our current understanding of the universe , in the form of the standard cosmological model , predicts that there are a number of different types of structures to be found in the universe .",
    "tiny perturbations in the matter density in the early universe will , under the influence of the force of gravity , evolve into various structures  @xcite .",
    "the early universe has a uniform three dimensional distribution , which , due to these perturbations , will collapse first in one dimension and form two dimensional sheets , so called zeldovich pancakes  @xcite .",
    "these pancakes will then collapse in the other dimensions , forming filaments , galaxy clusters and groups .",
    "as such , we would expect a universe filled with clusters of galaxies interlinked or fed by filaments and pancakes , not unlike the cosmic web seen from numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "galaxies and clusters of galaxies are easy to observe , but filaments , and especially pancakes , are more difficult to observe .",
    "the reason for this is , that they are considerably more diffuse and can be difficult to pick out from the average density of the universe , as they are only slightly more dense  @xcite .",
    "a pancake is a cosmological structure which is collapsing ( or has collapsed ) in only one dimension ( see figure [ fig : pancakes ] ) .",
    "this means that a pancake seen face - on may appear almost uniform on the sky .",
    "if the pancake is near a massive galaxy cluster , then the motion of the pancake galaxy members due to the hubble expansion will be perturbed by the galaxy cluster , leading to the pancake appearing as a relatively straight line in the projected phase - space ( r , v@xmath1 ) of radius and velocity @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a method , for finding and identifying pancakes in observational data .",
    "this method uses only the directly observational variables , namely the position on the sky and the redshift of the galaxy",
    ". we will show the results of this method applied to the environs of the coma galaxy cluster , outside the sphere of virialization , where no equilibrium has been achieved .",
    "additionally , we will test if what we find indeed are pancakes , or if they are some other type of structure ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "many attempts have been made in the literature to identify or classify large scale structures , including pancakes , using a variety of methods , dating all the way back to  @xcite .",
    "what most of these methods have in common , is that they are difficult to apply to observations and can only be used to identify structures in numerical simulations , due to three dimensional tensor and density field requirements .",
    "there are some exceptions  @xcite , which can be used on observational data to identify what @xcite refer to as walls , which are very large structures that consist of groups and clusters of galaxies , as well as filaments .",
    "@xcite presented a method , the multiscale morphology filter ( mmf ) , for identifying clusters , filaments and walls from samples of galaxies in redshift surveys or from cosmological n - body simulations .",
    "the method uses the delauney tessellation field estimator ( dtfe ) to create smoothed density fields , from which morphology response filters identify structures using hessian matrix eigenvalues .",
    "it was successfully tested using voronoi and n - body models , but can also be used to analyse observational data such as fingers of god from redshift surveys .",
    "@xcite also use hessian eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the smoothed density field to identify structures . with their algorithm",
    "they analyse mock galaxy distributions from a cosmological n - body simulation and observed galaxy distributions from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "they find similar morphology of structure for the two catalogs , with clumps dominating on smoothing scales of 5 h@xmath2 mpc and filaments on scales of 10 to 20 or 25 h@xmath2 mpc .",
    "walls were not found to be dominant on the smoothing scales studied , which was up to 25 h@xmath2 mpc , but the authors reported some evidence indicating a transition to wall - dominance at scales of 25 h@xmath2 mpc .",
    "@xcite found 212 or 444 pancakes ( depending on selection criteria ) and 204 or 436 filaments by analysing the density field of a sample from the sdss dr7 using minkowski functionals to identify structures . in both observations and mock catalogues they found that filamentary structures tend to be richer , larger and more luminous than pancakes . + in addition to the methods that are capable of analysing observational redshift surveys , there is a large number of methods which can only be used to identify structures in cosmological simulations  @xcite .",
    "some of these methods use dynamical properties  @xcite .",
    "@xcite use the eigenvalues of the velocity shear tensor to identify structures .",
    "@xcite defined what they call the v - web in terms of the eigenvalues of the velocity shear tensor and compared it to the t - web , which is defined by the eigenvalues of the hessian of the gravitational potential , as used by  @xcite .",
    "@xcite found the v - web to have increased resolution over the t - web .",
    "@xcite used a tessellation method to compute multi - stream and density fields and used minkowski functionals to identify structures .",
    "@xcite created images akin to landscapes from the density field and used common image analysis methods to segment and analyse the images .",
    "they subsequently classified structures using the eigenvalues of the hessian of the density field .",
    "all these methods are successful at identifying structures in cosmological simulations , and are used to classify and study the different types of large scale structures of the cosmic web .",
    "common amongst them is that they identify clumps , filaments and large wall - like structures from cosmological simulations , but can not be used on observational data .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we present our method for pancake detection . in section",
    "[ sec : numresults ] , we use our method on simulated data , in order to check if the method finds pancakes . in section",
    "[ sec : pancakes ] , we show the results of applying our method to observational data of the coma cluster and its environs . in section [ sec : veldisp ] , we test the coherency of the pancakes , as a confirmation that they indeed are pancakes .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : panmass ] we obtain mass estimates of the pancakes .",
    "our objective is to identify pancakes in observational data .",
    "when we use the term pancakes , we are referring to structures with specific properties and not simply a two - dimensional overdensity on the sky .",
    "these pancakes are relatively cold and coherent structures , that have collapsed in only one dimension and have a very specific shape in radius - velocity space .",
    "our search for these structures is independent of their appearance or overdensity on the sky , instead we identify them in radius - velocity space , where they stand out as clear overdensities in the form of almost straight , inclined lines .",
    "+   + the basic idea is to only use parameters which are directly observable , in such a way that the method can be applied to actual observational data . +   + * division of data into slices . *",
    "we select a 35x35 mpc@xmath3 region and divide the cluster environs into 64 slices centred on the cluster in right ascension vs declination ( ra , dec ) ( see figure [ fig : numxy ] ) , where we examine 8 adjacent slices at a time .",
    "we look for pancakes in radius vs line of sight velocity ( r , v@xmath1 ) by looking for overdensities ( see figure [ fig : numrv ] ) .",
    "as we are only interested in the non - virialized region , where the perturbation to their motion is almost linear , we remove the inner 5 mpc in radius from the cluster centre .",
    "+   +        * find overdensities .",
    "* we compare the density in the selected slices to the background density in ( r , v@xmath1 ) .",
    "we do this by counting the number of galaxies within an ellipse around each galaxy and comparing this to the number of galaxies within similar ellipses in the background , normalized by the background region to signal region ratio .",
    "we keep the signal data points that are above a certain threshold , where the threshold is an interval of 0.5 to 2 times the upper 2@xmath4 value of the background number density distribution . for each pancake",
    "we select an optimal threshold based on the density of the surrounding area .",
    "the background region is defined as all slices except the signal region and four adjacent slices on each side of the signal region .",
    "+   + * selection of pancakes . *",
    "if a pancake is present , and in our sensitivity range , we will obtain a rough pancake structure along with some noise .",
    "we iterate through the remaining data with our own friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm and select the largest structure , which is usually the pancake , if one is present . however , occassionally a large amount of noise will be present in one area , such as around v@xmath5 .",
    "once we have selected the pancake we include additional galaxies along the edges , within a small ellipse around each galaxy in the pancake .",
    "this is in order to compensate for the selection bias in our method , which is biased against the lower density areas at the edges of pancakes .",
    "at last we maximize the pancake signal to background ratio by adjusting the number of slices .",
    "we find that the optimal number of slices is typically 3 to 6 . +",
    "this method is only able to find pancakes when their orientation is approximately face on , as our method has difficulties when the pancake is seen edge on . while seeing the pancake edge on will make it appear more dense on the sky , it would also mean the pancake spans several mpc in the line of sight direction .",
    "in this case the hubble flow will disperse the pancake in the ( r , v@xmath1 ) plane , making it appear diffuse and , as such , difficult for our method to detect .",
    "another limitation of our method is , that it is most sensitive to pancakes with an inclination relative to our line of sight in the range @xmath6 20 and 70 degrees .",
    "pancakes outside of this interval will either be lost in the noise around v@xmath7 in ( r , v@xmath1 ) for small angles , or have little extent along the radius axis for large angles .",
    "+ our definition of a pancake is a structure that is collapsing ( or has collapsed ) in only one dimension .",
    "it is therefore in some degree of equilibrium in this dimension , but not in the other two dimensions , which are still in early stages of equilibration . as such",
    ", it is a two - dimensional structure that is relatively cold compared to groups and filaments .",
    "the structures we find are on scale 10 mpc and are somewhat bulky structures with moderate axis ratios ( see section [ sec : numdist ] ) . visually on the sky",
    "they consist of solitary galaxies , interspersed with a few groups of galaxies .",
    "we test our method on a cluster sized halo of pure dark matter particles from a cosmological n - body numerical simulation of pure dark matter based on wmap3 cosmology , with cosmological parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and hubble parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the simulation consists of @xmath11 particles , each of mass @xmath12 , in a box of size @xmath13 mpc . using the mpi version of the art code  @xcite @xcite ,",
    "the behavior of the particles is simulated from redshift @xmath14 .",
    "a hierarchical friends - of - friends algorithm with linking length of 0.17 times the mean interparticle distance was used to identify clusters and overdensities .",
    "twenty - five halos at redshift @xmath15 , with virial masses in the range @xmath16 , virial radii @xmath17 mpc and virial velocities @xmath18 km / s were selected . in order to provide datasets of manageable size , 10000 dark matter particles , in regions of 20 x 20 mpc@xmath3 to 30 x 30 mpc@xmath3 with velocities of @xmath19 km / s ,",
    "were randomly selected .",
    "the data is centered on the position of the most massive substructure found at a linking length 8 times shorter . in the following we treat the dark matter particles as the galaxies from observations .",
    "+ we apply our method to the 25 numerical halos , in the form of an automated overdensity finder in phase - space . from this",
    "we obtain a raw sample , and , through visual inspection , we select 20 pancake candidates .    in figures [ fig : numxy ] and [ fig : numrv ] we show a sample pancake identified near a halo of virial mass @xmath20 , virial radius @xmath21 mpc and virial velocity @xmath22 km / s . this is the only pancake located near this halo .",
    "both our method and a similar method employed by @xcite find the same pancake near this halo .",
    "for this numerical pancake we elected to keep 6 spatial slices , because reducing this number by any more slices lowers the signal considerably . keeping",
    "the 6 slices posed another problem , in that there was a large amount of noise present around @xmath23 .",
    "our numerical pancake was identified by our fof algorithm as being attached to a large almost horizontal strip , which we removed manually .",
    "although the horizontal strip could appear to be another pancake , we did not identify it as one , since our method has limitations with regards to low projection angles , where the background is large .",
    "we also cut the inner 5 mpc of the data , corresponding to roughly 2 virial radii .",
    "+ in the following we will examine , whether the numerical pancakes have the spatial distribution of particles we expect of pancakes .    .",
    "the figure shows radius , z distance from the halo centre ( r , z ) for the numerical pancake ( blue octagons ) .",
    "the fit , or ridgeline , is shown as a black line .",
    "sample bins along the radius axis are indicated by red lines and sample bins along the @xmath24 direction ( the direction perpendicular to the fit ) are seen as green lines.,width=317 ]      the galaxy distribution of an equilibrated galaxy group or cluster will appear as a roughly gaussian distribution in all dimensions .",
    "if we look at the density profile of structures in ( x , y ) and ( r , z ) , where r is the projected radius and x , y , z are the spatial coordinates , we would expect to see them collapsed in a different number of dimensions , depending on the structure .",
    "a collapsed dimension manifests itself as a roughly gaussian distribution , when binning and plotting density of data points as a function of distance in bin direction .",
    "a non - collapsed dimension , however , will show roughly as a `` top hat '' shape in a similar plot .",
    "to reiterate , for pancakes we would expect only one collapsed dimension .",

    "if we examine the line of sight direction , taken as the z direction , by looking at the z coordinate as a function of the projected radius ( r , z ) , then we can bin in two different ways to extract information about two of the dimensions of the pancake ( see figure [ fig : samplebins ] ) .",
    "first we fit the pancake with a straight line in ( r , z ) , this line can be considered the one dimensional centre , or ridgeline , of the pancake .",
    "we then bin parallel to this line , which provides us with information about the thickness of the pancake and the distribution of galaxies along this dimension .",
    "for the twenty numerical pancakes the resulting combined distribution is given by figure [ fig : tophat ] ( top ) , where we normalized the distance perpendicular to the pancake @xmath24 , with the dispersion in that direction @xmath28 for a given pancake .",
    "the plot shows number count per bin , n@xmath29 , as a function of normalized distance perpendicular to the ridgeline of the pancake , @xmath30 .",

    "next we bin perpendicular to the r axis , which tells us how the galaxies are distributed in a second dimension , namely along the length of the pancake . the resulting combined distribution for the twenty numerical pancakes is shown in figure [ fig : tophat ] ( middle ) , where we have normalized projected radius r vs number count per bin n(r ) .",
    "the projected radius was scaled by the minimum radius and normalized by the radial length of a given pancake .",
    "we see no hint of a gaussian distribution , but rather something roughly resembling a top hat shape , indicating a non - collapsed dimension .    for the third dimension we examine the plane of the pancake face on , that is we take the x and y as positional coordinates on the sky . in ( x , y )",
    "we bin along the aperture angle from the cluster centre , similar to the 64 spatial slices used in figure [ fig : numxy ] .",
    "from this we can see the width of the pancake and the distribution of galaxies in this last dimension .",
    "the resulting combined distribution for the twenty numerical pancakes is shown in figure [ fig : tophat ] ( bottom ) . here",
    "we have the normalized angle around a circle centred on the cluster , @xmath27 as x axis and the number count per bin , @xmath31 , as y axis .",
    "the @xmath27 values were scaled to start at zero and were normalized by the extent in the @xmath27 direction of a given pancake .",
    "again we see no hint of a gaussian distribution . + we see clearly , that the twenty numerical pancakes have one collapsed dimension and two non - collapsed dimensions , in accordance with our definition of a pancake .",
    "additionally , from the information in this section , we can examine the shape of the pancakes .",
    "if we consider the pancakes as tri - axial ellipsoids and take the radial extent as the major axis ( c ) and two times the one sigma value of the depth ( @xmath28 ) as the minor axis ( a ) , we obtain a measure of the shape of the pancakes , @xmath32 .",
    "so we see that the pancakes are quite bulky structures , with moderate axis ratios .",
    "it should be noted , that our method for pancake selection makes this result conservative .",
    "our pancakes could be longer ( or wider ) , depending on selection criteria , but we include the full depth of the pancakes within the selected region .    in the following section , we will present and discuss results obtained by using our method on spectroscopically observed galaxies near the coma galaxy cluster .",

    "we highlight a filament , coming down from north .",
    "filaments appears as 1-dimensional structures in this projection , as opposed to pancakes which are 2-dimensional on the sky . in green triangles",
    "we show four galaxy groups which clearly are localized in space @xcite.,width=317 ]            having calibrated our method from the numerical simulation , we look for pancakes in observational data .",
    "we have identified two pancakes near the coma galaxy cluster .",
    "these pancakes are the same as in @xcite .",
    "pancake 1 , however , is quite different from the one presented there .",
    "we optimized and froze our selection parameters using the numerical simulation , which meant that only the low radius portion of the pancake from @xcite was selected .",
    "the discarded high radius portion has much greater velocity dispersion and contains an overlapping galaxy group .",
    "these pancakes are located at great distances from coma , extending out from 7 - 8 mpc from the centre and stretching across roughly 8 mpc in length and up to 4 - 5 mpc in width .",

    "we immediately see that the velocity dispersion values of the pancakes typically are one third to half that of the velocity dispersion of the galaxy groups and the filament , indicating that our pancakes indeed are cold and coherent .",
    "the dispersion may have two independent origins .",
    "the first is related to the finite depth of the pancake , implying that the hubble expansion across the pancake varies .",
    "this will be relevant only if the pancake is in the early stage of collapsing , and still far from an equilibrated state .",
    "the other is related to a `` thermal '' velocity of the pancake in equilibrium , which is the 2-dimensional equivalent to the 3-dimensional solution of the spherical jeans equation , giving @xmath36 .",
    "the low observed velocity dispersions of all the pancakes and the galaxy distribution of the numerical pancake indicate that the hubble expansion contribution to the dispersion is likely to be minor .",
    "we assume that the numerical pancakes and the observational pancakes are in similar states of equilibrium .",
    "so if we can ignore the hubble expansion contribution to the dispersion , then the dispersion arises from the solution to the jeans equation in two dimensions .",

    "for the 20 pancakes identified in the numerical simulation we know all of these values and as such we find the pre - factor to be @xmath41 .",
    "using averages from the 20 numerical pancakes we can approximate the mass of the pancakes as @xmath42    observationally we can estimate both @xmath43 and the area , however , the depth is more difficult .",
    "we use the 20 numerical pancakes to this end , wherefrom we can either use @xmath44mpc or @xmath45mpc .",
    "both are fair approximations to the 20 numerical pancakes , and both are correct within a factor of two .    the areas on the sky are found to be approximately 37 mpc@xmath3 in projection for both coma pancakes . using the measured angle of orientation from observations ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) we get the actual area .",
    "we use @xmath48 as found in the numerical simulation . inserting these numbers , we find the total masses of the two coma pancakes to be @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively , using @xmath44mpc ( or @xmath51 and @xmath52 using @xmath45mpc ) .",
    "the precision of this estimate is about a factor of 2 from the value of @xmath48 and we estimate a factor of 2 for the depth of the pancakes .",
    "additionally we estimate a factor of 2 from the velocity dispersion , because we can not disentangle the velocity dispersion of the pancake from that of potentially embedded galaxy groups .",
    "the results are therefore accurate within a factor of 8",
    ".    * stellar mass estimates . *",
    "having identified the galaxies belonging to the pancakes , we can add the estimates of the stellar mass from @xcite .",
    "we find the stellar masses to be approximately @xmath53 for pancake 1 and @xmath54 for pancake 2 .",
    "this gives us an m@xmath55/m@xmath56 ratio of approximately @xmath57 and @xmath58 for pancake 1 and @xmath59 and @xmath60 for pancake 2 , indicating that the pancakes are extremely dark matter dominated , in good agreement with them being in an early stage of evolution .",
    "@xcite presented a novel method for identifying zeldovich pancakes in observational data .",
    "we expanded and refined the method , and we examined the properties of two observational pancakes found near the coma cluster using the method .",
    "this method differs from others in the literature , by identifying observational pancakes on relatively small scales of 10 mpc .",
    "we show that these structures are relatively cold , compared to typical groups of galaxies and filaments , with a velocity dispersion of around 100 km / s .",
    "these velocity dispersions are consistent with that of twenty pancakes identified in a cosmological simulation .",
    "we show that these simulation pancakes are only significantly collapsed or collapsing in one dimension . additionally , we determine the stellar to total mass ratio of the observational pancakes to be @xmath0 , within one order of magnitude .    in the near future",
    "we plan to fully automatize the pancake identification method and examine the environs of a large number of galaxy clusters .",
    "this should provide a statistically significant sample of observational pancakes , on the scale of 10 mpc , for further study .",
