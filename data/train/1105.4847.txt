    "then we have the conditional moment restriction .    [ examp14 ] the nonparametric quantile iv regression",
    "was previously studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the model is @xmath23 where @xmath0 is the unknown function of interest , and @xmath24 is known and fixed .",

    "then the conditional moment restriction is given by @xmath25    if we define @xmath26 ^ 2 $ ] , an equivalent way of writing model ( [ equ11 ] ) is then @xmath27 .",
    "when the unknown function @xmath0 depends on certain endogenous variable as in examples [ examp13 ] and [ examp14 ] , the identification and consistent estimation of @xmath0 is challenging .",
    "on one hand , there can be multiple functions in the parameter space that satisfy the moment restriction  ( [ equ11 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , even if @xmath0 is identified , [ in which case the functional @xmath28 is uniquely minimized at @xmath29 , as is typically assumed in the literature ] , reducing @xmath28 toward @xmath30 does not guarantee that @xmath31 will also be close to zero , for a certain norm of interest .",
    "therefore , minimizing a consistent estimator of @xmath28 does not lead to a consistent estimator of @xmath0 under .",
    "this phenomenon is usually known as the `` ill - posed inverse problem '' in the literature .",
    "the general form of ( [ equ11 ] ) was first studied by @xcite and @xcite , where the authors considered sieve approximation of @xmath0 and estimated it in a compact parameter space .",
    "recently , @xcite relaxed the compactness assumption and achieved the consistency and convergence rate using the penalized sieve minimum distance estimation .",
    "in recent years there has also been extensive literature on the npiv model ( example [ examp13 ] ) itself . in these papers ,",
    "the authors introduce a  tikhonov tuning parameter to play a role of `` regularization '' in order to overcome the ill - posed inverse problem ; see , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "other related works on the nonparametric instrumental variables can be found in @xcite , @xcite , horowitz ( @xcite , @xcite ) , among others .    compared to the growing literature from the frequentist perspective",
    ", there is very little understanding of the consistent estimation using either a bayesian or a quasi - bayesian approach .",
    "this paper proposes a quasi - bayesian procedure and studies the impact of various priors of @xmath0 on the posterior consistency .",
    "our setup is built on a sieve approximation technique similar to @xcite , which assumes that @xmath0 can be approximated arbitrarily well on a finite - dimensional sieve space . in order to keep our procedure robust to the distribution specification and convenient for practical implementation , without specifying a known distribution on the data generating process",
    ", we employ a limited information likelihood [ @xcite and @xcite ] , a moment - condition - based gaussian approximated likelihood .",
    "the use of such a likelihood is more straightforward for models characterized by either moment conditions or estimating equations than the common methods based on dirichlet process priors in the nonparametric bayesian literature . with priors placed directly on the sieve coefficients ,",
    "we show that the proposed posterior is consistent .",
    "due to the difficulty of identifying @xmath0 in practice , we do not assume @xmath0 to be necessarily identified . as a result",
    "the posterior consistency here means that , asymptotically , the posterior converges into arbitrarily small neighborhood of the region where @xmath0 is partially identified .",
    "therefore , we also extend model ( [ equ11 ] ) to the partial identification setup [ @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "we will consider three types of priors :",
    "( i ) priors supported on a bounded set ( truncated prior ) , ( ii ) priors with tails decaying fast outside a bounded set ( thin - tail prior ) and ( iii ) gaussian priors with nonshrinking variance .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed a quasi - bayesian approach for the npiv model .",
    "they assumed that the error term follows a normal distribution and achieved consistency by regularizing an operator that defines the posterior mean .",
    "our approach differs from theirs essentially in the way of overcoming the ill - posed inverse problem .",
    "while @xcite put a gaussian prior on an infinite - dimensional function space , they require the variance of the prior to shrink to zero .",
    "in contrast , we place the prior directly on the sieve coefficients in a finite - dimensional vector space and require the sieve dimension to grow slowly with the sample size .",
    "our approach then corresponds to chen and pouzo s ( @xcite ) sieve minimum distance procedure using slowly growing sieves . as a result , it is the finite - dimensional sieve that plays the role of regularization instead of a shrinking prior .",
    "in addition , our approach allows nonnormal priors .",
    "models based on moment conditions as ( [ equ11 ] ) have been proved to be essential in many statistical applications , such as financial asset pricing [ @xcite , @xcite ] , consumer behavior in economics [ @xcite , @xcite ] and return to college education [ @xcite ] .",
    "therefore , this paper develops a quite convenient and straightforward quasi - bayesian approach for these applied problems .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec2 ] introduces general theorems on two types of posterior consistency , which provide sufficient conditions under which a posterior constructed on a sieve space is consistent .",

    "such a treatment arises for two reasons .",
    "first , when the conditional moment restriction is given by the nonparametric instrumental variable regression ( example [ examp13 ] ) , the identification of @xmath0 depends on the completeness of the conditional distribution of @xmath153 [ @xcite ] ; however , the completeness assumption is hard to verify if the conditional distribution of @xmath153 does not belong to the exponential family .",
    "@xcite explored identification issues with these models and noted that the point identification can easily fail ; see example 3.2 of @xcite .",
    "for another reason , sometimes instead of @xmath0 itself , we are only interested in a particular characteristic of it , for example , its linear functional @xmath154 .",

    "<S> this paper addresses the estimation of the nonparametric conditional moment restricted model that involves an infinite - dimensional parameter @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate it in a _ quasi - bayesian _ way , based on the limited information likelihood , and investigate the impact of three types of priors on the posterior consistency : ( i ) truncated prior ( priors supported on a bounded set ) , ( ii ) thin - tail prior ( a prior that has very thin tail outside a growing bounded set ) and ( iii ) normal prior with nonshrinking variance . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xmath0 is allowed to be only partially identified in the frequentist sense , and the parameter space does not need to be compact . </S>",
    "<S> the posterior is regularized using a slowly growing sieve dimension , and it is shown that the posterior converges to any small neighborhood of the identified region . </S>",
    "<S> we then apply our results to the nonparametric instrumental regression model . finally , the posterior consistency using a random sieve dimension parameter is studied .    .    . </S>"
