    "<S> unlike previous experiments , the energy scale of atom - ion interactions is not determined by either the atomic cloud temperature or the ion s trap residual excess - micromotion energy . </S>",
    "<S> instead , it is determined by the force the atom exerts on the ion during a collision which is then amplified by the trap dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is intrinsic to ion paul traps and sets the lower bound of atom - ion steady - state interaction energy in these systems . despite the fact that our system is eventually driven out of the ultra - cold regime </S>",
    "<S> , we are capable of studying quantum effects by limiting the interaction to the first collision .    since its first inception @xcite , observing quantum mechanical phenomena was the holy grail of hybrid atom - ion research @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization potential between atoms and ions scales as r@xmath0 and extends to 100 s of nm . </S>",
    "<S> this long length - scale interaction can form macroscopic objects @xcite while exhibiting quantum features such as feshbach @xcite and shape resonances @xcite at sufficiently low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> ultra - cold atom - ion systems are appealing new platforms for performing quantum computation @xcite and many - body physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , all experiments so far relied on sympathetic cooling of the ion by the atomic cloud and were limited to above mk energy scale .    </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between the ion s radio - frequency ( rf ) trap oscillating electric fields and sympathetic cooling has been known for a long time @xcite . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it was theoretically shown that sympathetic cooling of the ion results in a non - thermal energy distribution with a power - law tail , the magnitude of which depends on the atom - ion mass ratio and trap parameters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is closely related , among other examples , to anomalous diffusion in optical lattices @xcite and is well described by non - maxwellian statistics which was introduced by tsallis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the ion is sufficiently lighter than the cooling atoms its mean energy diverges and collisions eventually result in ion loss from trap .    in stable mixtures </S>",
    "<S> the mean steady - state energy of the ion is proportional , albeit with potentially a large amplification factor , to the energy of a single collision at the trap center which is determined by , e.g. , residual excess - micromotion ( emm ) @xcite or the atoms temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore interesting to ask what would determine the steady state temperature and ion dynamics when the ion is initialized in the ground state of the trap and both ion s emm and atoms temperature are negligible ? </S>",
    "<S> recently , the energy involved in a single collision was calculated to be determined by the atom - ion attraction during collision which pulls the ion away from the trap minimum into finite rf regions of the trap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the quantum dynamics of ultra - cold atom - ion collisions was calculated and has shown significant heating that depends on the trap parameters used @xcite .    in this experiment </S>",

    "<S> our results show a clear deviation from maxwell - boltzmann to tsallis energy distribution with a pronounced power - law tail . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the heating mechanism in our system is indeed seeded by the pulling of the ion from the trap center and is in good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations .    during a collision </S>",

    "<S> glancing collisions , which have a larger impact parameter than @xmath7 , are purely elastic and involve only very small momentum transfer . in contrast </S>",
    "<S> , langevin collisions involve large momentum transfer and can also lead to inelastic processes such as spin exchange or relaxation @xcite , charge exchange @xcite , molecule formation @xcite and three - body recombination @xcite . while the loss of atoms from the trap in the presence of an ion is dominated by glancing collisions @xcite we expect the heating of the ion to be dominated by the large momentum transfer of langevin collisions , the rate of which , @xmath10 , is energy independent . for our experimental parameters ( reduced mass @xmath11 and atomic peak density @xmath12 @xmath13 ) </S>",
