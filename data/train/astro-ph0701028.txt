    "the damped lyman-@xmath6 absorbers ( dlas ) observed along sight - lines to quasars ( qsos ) are potentially important pieces in the puzzle of galaxy formation .",
    "they are the highest column density absorption systems , with @xmath7 , and the first dla surveys quickly established that they contain a large fraction of the high-@xmath8 baryons _ available _ for star formation @xcite .",
    "the early estimates of the neutral gas mass density at absorption redshifts @xmath9 were similar to the estimates of the mass density in stars at @xmath10 .",
    "it was therefore natural to assume that dlas act as the neutral gas reservoirs for star formation .",
    "however , firmly establishing the link between dlas and star formation relies on our understanding of the absorber  galaxy connection .",
    "direct imaging of dlas ( or strong mgii systems ; see below ) at @xmath11 reveals the hosts to be a mix of irregulars , dwarfs , spirals and low surface - brightness galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is further borne out by a blind 21-cm emission survey at @xmath10 @xcite . however , quantifying the mix of dla host - galaxy morphologies from low- to high - redshift is fraught with selection effects , not least of which are luminosity bias against faint galaxies and the proximity of some host - galaxies to the qso sight - line .",
    "indeed , very few dla host - galaxies have been identified at @xmath12 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mgii @xmath52796/2803 doublet has proved very important for exploring the absorber ",
    "galaxy connection at @xmath13 where it is observable with optical qso absorption spectroscopy .",
    "indeed , many of the @xmath11 imaging studies above initially identified absorption systems via the easily recognised mgii doublet ( see also , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also , since the ionization potential of mgi is @xmath14 but that of mgii is @xmath15 , the latter traces cold gas .",
    "attempts have therefore been made to identify dla candidates at low-  via their mgii absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mgii doublet transitions are also among the strongest metal lines observed in qso absorbers , meaning that ( i ) the mgii @xmath52796 rest - frame equivalent width in dlas is typically @xmath16 , allowing such systems to be identified in relatively low - resolution spectra , and ( ii ) most velocity components across the mgii profile are saturated in dlas .",
    "this implies that  is mainly sensitive to the kinematic extent of the velocity components , @xmath17 , rather than their column density . a good demonstration of this is figure 3 of @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we search for a relationship between  and the metallicity } \\equiv \\log[n({\\rm m})/n({\\rm h } ) ] -    \\log[n({\\rm m})/n({\\rm h})]_\\odot$ ] ] , [ m / h ] , of dlas and strong sub - dlas .",
    "since  is a measure of the kinematic spread of the cold , metal - bearing velocity components , such a relationship may constrain the mechanisms for producing and dispersing the metals .",
    "this may guide our understanding of the physical nature of dlas .",
    "there currently exist only indirect and possibly contradictory constraints on a [ m / h]  relationship for dlas and sub - dlas .",
    "@xcite suggest that [ m / h ] increases with increasing .",
    "they identified strong mgii systems in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) qso spectra over the redshift range @xmath18 and constructed composite spectra in the absorber rest - frame .",
    "the zn ii lines were stronger in the composite of @xmath19absorbers compared with those in the composite of @xmath20systems . assuming that the mean  is not significantly different in these two regimes , they conclude that some evidence exists for a [ zn / h]  correlation .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite find less direct evidence for an anti - correlation between [ zn / h ] and . from a series of composite sdss spectra with various mean  they find that the dust - reddening ,",
    "@xmath21 , caused by the absorbers rises sharply with increasing .",
    "while the znii line - strengths also increase , they show a slower increase than @xmath21 over the same range of .",
    "the composite spectra also suggest a dust extinction curve typical of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , leading @xcite to assume a constant dust - to - gas ratio , i.e.  @xmath22 , as observed in the smc .",
    "thus , since the znii column density increases slower than the  inferred from @xmath21 under this assumption , @xcite argue that [ zn / h ] decreases with increasing .",
    "we discuss these results further in light of our new results in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ sec : corr ] explains our sample selection and explores an evident [ m / h]  relationship in that sample .",
    "section [ sec : disc ] compares our results with the [ m / h]@xmath23 correlation recently discovered by @xcite at ( generally ) higher redshifts .",
    "we also discuss whether our observed [ m / h]  relationship can be taken as evidence for a correlation or anti - correlation between absorber metallicity and host - galaxy mass .",
    "finally , we discuss whether a large fraction of strong mgii absorbers might arise in outflows from relatively low mass galaxies .",
    "in particular , about half of those absorbers in which h@xmath24 has been detected show some evidence of an outflow origin .",

    "three main objections might be raised to some of the data we use in table [ dla ] : ( i ) some of the metallicities are not derived from zn and so might be susceptible to dust - depletion effects , even though we have made a crude correction to any metallicities derived using the heavily depleted fe and cr ions ; ( ii ) absorbers with low  might contain a significant number of velocity components which are not completely saturated . while  still provides a measure of velocity spread , @xmath23 , in these systems ,  will also depend somewhat on the optical depths of the unsaturated components .",
    "therefore , as the mgii velocity components weaken at lower [ m / h ] , one might expect a correlation between [ m / h ] and  which has little to do with the correlation found at higher .",
    "one might consider that only systems with @xmath185  should be used since the profile is even more likely to be completely saturated ; ( iii ) finally , the reliability of sub - dla metallicities is not as well established in the literature as that for dlas .",
    "it is possible that we do not fully understand the ionization corrections required in some cases or , indeed , the magnitude of the systematics involved in deriving  in sub - dlas . for example , voigt profile  estimates closer to the flat part of the curve of growth naturally have larger random uncertainties and may become increasingly , systematically influenced by weaker ly-@xmath6 forest lines .",
    "however , table [ stats ] shows that the [ m / h]correlation is fairly robust against removal of non - zn metallicities , systems with @xmath186  or sub - dlas . removing all three cases together also leaves a @xmath4 correlation ( @xmath187 after correcting the metallicities for redshift evolution ) .",

    "interpret their observed mass  anti - correlation as evidence that outflows become the dominant mechanism for producing mgii absorbers as  increases beyond @xmath221 .",
    "they reason that outflows are more easily ejected from lower mass star - forming galaxies and so , when viewed along a random qso sight - line , are more likely to produce more mg ii velocity components over a larger velocity range . in this outflow picture ,  and the number of mgii velocity components may be inversely related to the mass and could depend more strongly on the recent star - formation history of the host - galaxy .",

    "an initial objection to the outflow model for dlas and strong mg ii systems might be that such hot , highly ionized material may not produce velocity components of cold gas which can be traced with low - ionization species such as mgii .",
    "however , the outflows from local starburst galaxies are well - known to contain clouds of cold gas and dust @xcite .",
    "dense , molecular gas is also known to be entrained in smaller scale outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "moreover , @xcite identified mgii absorption in spectra of two qso sight - lines with impact parameters @xmath222 and @xmath223 near the galaxy ngc 520 , a local starburst with super - winds , a disturbed morphology and filamentary h@xmath6 emission along its minor axis .",

    ", the two highest-  systems , those towards q0013 - 0029 and q0551 - 366 , both contain  @xcite and have  values at the extreme of the  distribution obtained from large sdss mgii surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "even with only six  systems , a kolmogorov - smirnov test gives a probability of just 9per cent that the equivalent widths of the  absorbers are drawn from the same parent population as the rest of the sample .    in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] we compare the velocity structures of all the 13 known h@xmath24-bearing dlas and sub - dlas .",
    "it is striking how similar the velocity structures are for the systems towards q0515@xmath264414 , q0551@xmath26366 and q0013@xmath260029 : each is spread over @xmath226  and comprises at least three groups of stronger velocity components separated by few ( if any ) weaker components .",
    "the systems towards q1444@xmath30014 and q2343@xmath30125 have very similar profiles and these are not dissimilar to the above three .",
    "also , the systems towards q2348@xmath26011 and q0528@xmath26250 both have two broad , saturated regions separated by a narrow region of low optical depth . such structures and symmetries have been discussed by @xcite and @xcite as being the characteristic signs of absorption in galactic outflows .",
    "it is also conceivable that these profiles are produced in galaxy mergers ( but see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "although no strong conclusions can be reached due to the sample size , fig .",
    "[ profiles ] nevertheless suggests that approximately half of the known h@xmath24-bearing systems may arise in outflows .",
    "if indeed cold gas and dust is entrained in outflows and the gas is well - shielded then h@xmath24 should form on the surface of dust - grains .",
    "even if this happens in very few clouds , the large number of clouds across these profiles significantly increases the probability of observing one or more h@xmath24-bearing clouds towards any given background qso .",
    "hence , even if these outflow - like absorption profiles are themselves rare , h@xmath24 may be found within them in a large fraction of cases .",
    "[ profiles ] also shows the velocity structures of the 21-cm absorbers in our sample for which uves spectra were available .",
    "these velocity structures are typical of those in the general population , seemingly consistent with the fact that the 21-cm absorbers are generally indistinct from most other systems in the [ m / h]  plane ( fig .",
    "[ m - w ] ) . like h@xmath24 absorption",
    ", 21-cm absorption should arise in cold clouds , but there is no evidence in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] to suggest that 21-cm absorbers also arise in the complicated and broad outflow - like profiles like the h@xmath24 systems .",
    "however , the 21-cm sample is very small and is dominated by low-@xmath180 systems ; outflows are likely to be less common below @xmath227 due to the general decline in the global star - formation rate density ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note that , under the assumption of a mass - metallicity relationship , the absorbers with the highest equivalent widths and metallicities will be most easily detected in direct imaging observations .",
    "this prediction is also natural in the outflow picture where  and the number of mgii velocity components are related to both the mass and the recent star - formation history of the absorber host - galaxy .",
    "while one expects the highest  and highest [ m / h ] systems to be hosted by lower mass galaxies , they should be actively star - forming and show strong h@xmath6 emission .",
    "if indeed h@xmath24-bearing systems more often probe star - forming galaxies with outflows , they may be more reliable tracers of the cosmological evolution of metallicity than other dlas , many of which might not be closely linked to star - formation sites / processes in high-@xmath8 galaxies .",
    "we have already advanced this possibility in @xcite and @xcite based on a comparison of h@xmath24 absorber metallicities with those of the general dla population .",
    "the h@xmath24 absorbers showed a faster , more well - defined increase in [ m / h ] with decreasing redshift , although the sample was quite small . a much larger sample of h@xmath24-bearing systems is required to compute the -weighted metallicity evolution in a way comparable with general dla samples .",
    "for 49 dlas and sub - dlas with published metallicities we have measured or gathered from the literature their mgii rest - frame equivalent widths to search for an empirical relationship between the kinematic spread , @xmath23 , in the absorbing metal - line velocity components and the total absorber metallicity .",
    "the vast majority of dlas and strong sub - dlas have @xmath228  which means that most mgii velocity components across the absorption profile are saturated .",
    "thus ,  provides a simple measure of @xmath23 which can be derived even from relatively low - resolution qso spectra .",

    "[ m - w](left ) ] which increases to @xmath2 when the [ m / h ] values are corrected for mild cosmological evolution over the sample s redshift range of @xmath0 [ fig .  [ m - w](right ) ] . even for our most conservative sub - sample , where we include only 26 dlas ( no sub - dlas ) with zn - metallicities and @xmath3 , we still find a correlation at @xmath4 ( @xmath187 after redshift - correction of [ m / h ] ) .",
    "after converting the  values to @xmath23 , the slope of our [ m / h]@xmath229 relationship is consistent with that reported recently by @xcite for generally higher-  dlas and sub - dlas , suggesting that the [ m / h]  correlation persists up to @xmath230 .",
    "although we find a lower statistical significance for the correlation below @xmath184 , the fitted slope and intercept of the [ m / h]@xmath229 data is similar for the @xmath231 and @xmath232 sub - samples .",
    "finally , we find marginal ( @xmath233 ) evidence for increased variance in metallicity above @xmath181 .",
    "however , the evidence weakens once the [ m / h ] values are corrected for evolution ; other non - intrinsic sources of metallicity scatter may need to be addressed before such an effect can be verified .    if one assumes that the metal - line absorption kinematics trace the host - galaxy kinematics  that @xmath23 is proportional to the host - galaxy circular velocity",
    " then it is natural to translate the observed [ m / h]  correlation into a correlation between [ m / h ] and galaxy mass .",
    "indeed , @xcite make this assumption and find that the resulting [ m / h]mass correlation is consistent with the [ m / h]luminosity relationship derived from local galaxies .",
    "however , by studying the clustering of galaxies around strong mgii absorbers in the sdss , @xcite find that mass is anti - correlated with .",
    "this result , together with the [ m / h]relationship observed here , implies that the absorber metallicity is anti - correlated with halo or galaxy mass .",
    "it is therefore important to confirm or refute the results of @xcite and to address the assumption of @xcite with observations .",
    "finally , we note that about half of the known  absorbers have very broad velocity structures which show distinct distributions of velocity components ( fig .",
    "[ profiles ] ) .",
    "the patterns , groups and symmetries evident in these cases are consistent with an outflow origin for the bulk of the components .",
    "since outflows can entrain cold , dusty gas and since they should provide a large number of velocity components , the probability of finding one or more -bearing components in any given outflow - driven absorber might be quite high , even though -bearing components are themselves quite rare .",
    "this suggests the targeting of high-  absorbers to identify more -bearing systems .",
    "given the [ m / h]  correlation we observe , this may be similar to the metallicity - selection approach of @xcite .",
    "however , it has the advantage that one can determine  with only moderate - resolution spectra  or infer it from the equivalent width of bluer transitions when @xmath234  which need not be blue- or uv - sensitive ( e.g.  sdss spectra ) .",
