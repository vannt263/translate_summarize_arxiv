    "[ [ section ] ]    the use of manifolds containing conical singularities to model ( infinitely ) thin line sources has now become quite common .",
    "for example , a space - time metric which is flat except for a single conical singularity is a reasonable starting point in the investigation of the physics of cosmic strings - topological defects which may be generated by phase transitions occurring in certain grand unified models @xcite .",
    "conical singularities also arise when considering the thermodynamic properties of black holes . by making the integral curves of the ( previously time - like ) killing vector in a euclideanized static black hole metric",
    "suitably periodic , it is possible to construct a partition function for a quantum field propagating on the black hole background . the contribution of the quantum field to the black hole entropy",
    "can then be easily obtained by standard thermodynamic methods @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "in addition to these applications in four dimensions , it has been recognized that conical singularities play a crucial role in 2 + 1 dimensional gravity @xcite @xcite .",
    "the gravitational field of the einstein theory in 2 + 1 dimensions has no dynamical degrees of freedom ( i.e. there is no graviton in the theory ) and gravitational interaction is possible only by the fact that every massive particle has an associated conical singularity . the more massive the particle , the more `` pointed '' the cone it induces on the space - time manifold .",
    "two particle scattering is then facilitated simply by each particle travelling on the cone generated by the other .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    with regard to the conical singularity as a model of cosmic strings ,",
    "one of the less pleasing features of the infinitely thin idealization is that there is a delta function singularity of riemannian curvature at the position of the string itself ( see @xcite or section 12 of this paper ) . whilst this is not necessarily fatal , indeed there are now well defined procedures for dealing with this issue , it is more appealing to regard the conical metric as being the exterior space - time to some finite sized cylindrical body , which is suitably well behaved at the origin of coordinates . naturally appropriate boundary conditions are required to patch together the interior and exterior solutions ( @xcite or section 12 ) and the result is a metric describing the space - time of a finitely thick but infinitely long cylindrical body .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    another natural generalization is the space - time of a rotating , cylindrically symmetric body .",
    "for example , it has already been shown that in a particular model of a superconducting cosmic string , the angular momentum of the left moving and right moving modes may not cancel , resulting in a string with net angular momentum @xcite .",
    "another example occurs in chern - simons field theory , where string - like objects with angular momentum can also occur @xcite .",
    "additionally it is hard to imagine a mechanism which would prevent one simply adding angular momentum to a finite thickness cylindrical body by hand , although naturally one must bear the infinite length of such an object in mind .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    the natural starting place for this problem would seem to be to generalize the metric describing a simple conical singularity by adding angular momentum to the space - time .",
    "this was duly done @xcite , but threw up some surprising results .",
    "the constructed metric contained closed time - like curves concentrated in a finite region around the axis of symmetry , and it was soon realized that in addition to the curvature singularity , this model had a torsion singularity on axis as well @xcite @xcite . from then on approaches diverged as to how best to treat the problem . with the appearance of torsion",
    ", some authors argued that this metric was best considered within the framework of einstein - cartan theory , which naturally incorporates torsion as well as curvature @xcite .",
    "models were constructed within einstein - cartan theory to describe the space - time of a conical singularity with spin @xcite , whilst other authors chose a different direction .",
    "discovering that the first quantized scattering problem on the manifold was badly defined within the closed time - like curve region @xcite , it was argued that by restricting the angular momentum of the string to certain values ( and hence invoking a quantization condition ) , it is possible to make the string `` transparent '' to scattering experiments , and hence remove the difficulty with the closed time - like curve region @xcite .",
    "others argued for the presence of angular momentum dependence in the first quantum correction to the vacuum energy , with analogy to the case of the spinning circle @xcite , or simply on dimensional grounds @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    in this paper we will take a different point of view .",
    "it is clearly the region immediately around the axis which causes the difficulties .",
    "the hamiltonian of scalar quantum fields is non - hermitian here , both in quantum mechanics @xcite and in quantum field theory ( see section 11 ) .",
    "more convincingly , the results of menotti and seminara ( @xcite and following papers ) indicate that if the energy - momentum tensor of the space - time satisfies the weak energy condition , and if we have no closed time - like curves ( ctc s ) at spatial infinity ( which must be conical and open in nature ) , then there are no ctc s in the space - time at all . in other words ,",
    "any energy - momentum tensor which we write down as a source of the spinning conical space - time will be non - physical ( violate the weak energy condition ) if we include the region of closed time - like curves . thus we will consider the spinning conical space - time only as the exterior solution to some interior space - time , which extends beyond the closed time - like curve region and is torsion free .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    there are a variety of models that one can choose for the interior space - time ( @xcite , but note @xcite ) .",
    "since our eventual aim is to calculate the effective action for a massive scalar quantum field propagating on the manifold , the interior contribution to the effective action will be model dependent .",
    "therefore we will initially concentrate on the exterior ( model independent ) terms , returning to consider the interior metric again in section 12 , where we will look at the particular case of the cylindrical shell .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    the metric describing a simple conical singularity at the origin of co - ordinates can be written in several ways ( see , for example , @xcite ) . the representation which will be used in this paper can be expressed in cylindrical polar co - ordinates as follows ,    @xmath1    where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the form of this metric makes it obvious that the space - time is locally flat , but it differs globally from minkowski space ( expressed in cylindrical polar co - ordinates ) because of the identification in the angular variable , @xmath8 .",
    "this condition means that a `` wedge '' ( or deficit angle ) is removed from the range of @xmath8 , and then the edges of the excised region are identified , resulting in a conical manifold .",
    "clearly @xmath9 is related to the magnitude of the deficit angle , and it dictates the degree of `` sharpness '' of the cone . if @xmath10 then there is no deficit angle and we recover the metric for minkowski space .",
    "[ [ section-7 ] ]    in the above space - time the source is envisaged to be an infinitely long , infinitesimally thin tube along the @xmath11-axis of the co - ordinate set . whilst the space - time is locally flat away from the origin",
    ", there is in fact a delta function singularity of curvature at the origin ( see @xcite or section 12 ) . with regard to the physical parameters relating to the source ,",
    "@xmath9 may be expressed in terms of the mass per unit length @xmath12 by the relation @xmath13 . from now on factors of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and so on will be suppressed in all expressions except where noted .",
    "[ [ section-8 ] ]    in order to consider rotating sources , metric ( 1 ) needs to be generalized to include an angular momentum parameter .",
    "this parameter describes the effect that source spin has on the exterior space - time .",
    "the metric for a conical space - time with a spinning source takes the form    @xmath17    where @xmath18 parameterizes the angular momentum and has the dimensions of length @xcite , @xmath19 is a constant @xcite , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the precise relationship between @xmath18 and the physical angular momentum per unit length , @xmath24 , can be written as @xmath25 .",
    "[ [ section-9 ] ]    in addition to the curvature singularity , it can be shown that this metric also contains a torsion delta function singularity at the origin ( @xmath26 ) @xcite @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-10 ] ]    the space - time described by metric ( 2 ) clearly possesses closed time - like curves ( for example the contour described by @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 = constant , @xmath31 is closed and time - like ) . whilst it has been shown that classically there are no closed time - like geodesics in this space - time @xcite , in the path integral formulation of field theory one",
    "is supposed to include weighted contributions from all paths , including those non classical paths described by the closed time - like curves .",
    "we would therefore expect unitarity problems describing physics on this manifold . as a consequence we restrict the radial co - ordinate @xmath32 .",
    "this is sufficient to remove the difficulties with the closed time - like curves and will allow us to discuss quantum field theory on the manifold .",
    "the rest of the space - time ( @xmath33 ) is supposed to be composed of the source core , which is described by another metric and must be matched to this one with appropriate conditions at the boundary ( @xcite or section 12 ) .",
    "the included constant @xmath19 is determined by correctly matching the components of the two metrics at the boundary @xmath34 .",
    "[ [ section-11 ] ]    it should be noted that this metric is stationary , but not static .",
    "the applicability of conical methods to stationary but non static space - times has not yet been proved in general , but there is some strong evidence to indicate that these methods hold there too .",
    "for example , the first quantum correction to the effective action on the kerr - newman black hole background has been obtained using conical methods @xcite , after verifying that the induced conical singularity still behaved in a distributional sense .",
    "since it has already been demonstrated that the conical singularity in this space - time behaves in a distribution manner ( @xcite @xcite and section 12 ) we can have confidence that application of conical methods will yield useful results .",
    "[ [ section-12 ] ]    we can define a new time co - ordinate @xmath35 such that @xmath36 ( or alternatively @xmath37 ) . additionally we can write @xmath38 . with these co - ordinates we can re - write metric ( 2 ) as    @xmath39    where we make the following identifications , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath4 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "[ [ section-13 ] ]    the manifold as we have defined it above excludes the origin and the closed time - like curve region .",
    "therefore it has no curvature , no torsion , and quantum theory on this manifold should avoid potential unitarity problems .",
    "[ [ section-14 ] ]    it will be convenient in what follows to perform the calculations in a space - time with a euclidean signature . by continuing the @xmath45 , @xmath46 co - ordinates to imaginary values ,",

    "[ [ section-16 ] ]    we define the differential operator @xmath56 on our manifold by the expression    @xmath57    where @xmath58 , and we define the euclidean feynman propagator @xmath59 for a scalar field of mass @xmath60 by the equation    @xmath61    we may regard @xmath62 as the euclidean klein - gordon operator on the manifold , the four dimensional delta function can be expressed as follows ,    @xmath63    [ [ section-17 ] ]    the eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath62 with the correct cylindrical symmetry and angular behaviour may be written as follows , @xcite    @xmath64    with eigenvalues    @xmath65    @xmath66 is a bessel function of the first kind .",
    "many of the properties of the special functions used in this paper can be located either in @xcite or @xcite . by standard sturm - liouville theory",
    "we may immediately write down the euclidean feynman propagator for massive scalar fields on this space - time as    @xmath67    where @xmath68 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath69 and @xmath70 takes the role of a schwinger parameter .",
    "[ [ section-18 ] ]    there is a relationship between the euclidean heat kernel @xmath71 for the diffusion problem on this manifold and the euclidean green s function , namely    @xmath72    if we note the following integral identities ,    @xmath73    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is a modified bessel function of the first kind , we may write an expression for the euclidean heat kernel of this problem as follows ,    @xmath76",
    "[ [ section-19 ] ]    having found an expression for the euclidean heat kernel of the system , our intention is to use it to find a regularized expression for the determinant of the klein - gordon operator @xmath77 on this manifold .",
    "this in turn will allow us to write down the first quantum correction term in the effective action ( see section 11 ) .",
    "[ [ section-20 ] ]    before we can proceed with this operation , we need to find a simpler expression for the heat kernel , which can be more easily manipulated . in order to proceed further we must invoke a complex representation for the modified bessel function @xmath78 ,    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the contour depicted above in figure 1 .    [",
    "[ section-21 ] ]    we now gather together terms in the expression for the heat kernel which depend on @xmath81 and perform the summation over @xmath81 , i.e. we evaluate the following sum ,    @xmath82    [ [ section-22 ] ]    let us define the following functions , @xmath83 and @xmath84 for real @xmath85 .",
    "they are defined such that @xmath86 , @xmath87 gives the integer part of @xmath85 and @xmath88 gives the fractional part of @xmath85 , where @xmath89 for both positive and negative @xmath85 .",

    "it is then clear that the above sum can be re - written ( using @xmath92 ) as    @xmath93    this sum can be evaluated by standard means , and gives the result    @xmath94    [ [ section-23 ] ]    the two terms resulting from the above summation are very similar , and if we let @xmath95 in one of the terms , it becomes the negative of the other .",
    "this suggests altering the contour @xmath80 in the integral over @xmath11 to the contour @xmath96 , which is depicted in figure 2 .",
    "this enables us to write the heat kernel in the following form ,    @xmath97",
    "[ [ section-24 ] ]    having recast the problem into one involving contour integration , we can now manipulate the contour to make evaluation of the integral easier . in particular , it will be seen that it is easy to pick out the ( rotating , euclideanized ) minkowski space contribution to the heat kernel ( in other words terms which one would expect in flat , non - conical , but rotating space ) .",
    "the remainder should be considered as a correction to the rotating minkowski space result caused by a combination of the conical and spinning nature of the space .",
    "[ [ section-25 ] ]    examining the integrand of ( 19 ) carefully , we see that there are poles all along the real axis , at @xmath98 . by manipulating the contour @xmath96 into the contour @xmath99 , as shown in figure 3 , it is easy to pick out the contribution of the @xmath100 pole .",
    "the contours in the right hand diagram which do not encircle the pole at @xmath100 are designated @xmath99 .",
    "the curves constituting @xmath99 can always be chosen so they pass arbitrarily close to the @xmath100 pole , and hence we pick up no other polar contribution inside our contours of integration .",

    "the procedure used is somewhat lengthy , so in order to demonstrate the technique it seems appropriate that we first consider the simpler case of a conical singularity with non - zero flux ( but zero rotation ) .",
    "[ [ section-29 ] ]    in the case of non - zero flux , the metric is the same as for an infinitesimally thin line source at the origin ( 1 ) , but",

    "after finding the eigenfunctions in this space - time which satisfy the cylindrical symmetry and twisted field requirements , we can go through exactly the same procedure as above to derive an expression for the heat kernel .",

    "[ [ section-89 ] ]    in the course of this article we have employed a variety of mathematical techniques in order to obtain the renormalized first order effective action for massive scalar field theory with a self interacting @xmath306 type potential on the space - time generated by a rotating cylindrical shell .",
    "we have demonstrated that this theory is well defined , and is not troubled by the closed time - like curves and unitarity problems that have hindered previous attempts at quantization on such a space - time .",
    "having obtained the effective potential @xmath307 , it can then be used to model quantum physics on the manifold , which behaves as if we were dealing with a classical field theory with field variable @xmath308 and potential @xmath309 .",
    "it remains to be seen whether there are any interesting phenomenological consequences of the new terms in the effective action , particularly with regard to the physics of cosmic strings and astrophysics in general , and also in electromagnetic theory , where there is an analogous system in the aharanov - bohm effect @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-90 ] ]    since many of the novel features in our effective action first arose in section 10 , where we dealt with the regularization and renormalization of the theory , it seems appropriate to expand a little on the discussion of the procedure which was used there to regulate the @xmath18 dependent terms in the effective action . a superior and more illuminating way in which this regulation can be achieved will now be suggested .",
    "[ [ section-91 ] ]    it will be recalled that in section 10 dimensional regularization was used to regulate the integral of the @xmath18 independent term of @xmath145 ( expression ( 59 ) ) and then terms were subtracted from the @xmath18 dependent parts of @xmath145 so that they would cancel with the regulated @xmath18 independent term in the limit @xmath184 .",
    "i would like to suggest an alternative regularization procedure , in which integral ( 59 ) is rendered ultra - violet finite in the following manner ,    @xmath310    @xmath311 being a regulation parameter in the same manner as @xmath312 , which was employed previously in section 10 .",
    "the added exponential term in the integrand has the effect of supressing the @xmath313 ( small time , high frequency ) contribution to the integral and hence provides an ultra - violet cut off , making the expression finite for non - zero @xmath311 .",
    "the @xmath18 dependent terms of @xmath182 may also be regulated in this way ( they are potentially divergent at s=0 ) and this gives the result    @xmath314    the equivalent of expression ( 60 ) , although still including the regulation parameter @xmath311 , can therefore be written    @xmath315    [ [ section-92 ] ]    it is now conventional to redefine the bare coupling constants of the theory to absorb the poles in @xmath311 of the above expression as @xmath316 . to that end",

    "it should be noted that if @xmath183 , then all the above terms cancel precisely with one another .",
    "this implies that in the non - spinning limit ( @xmath183 ) of our spinning space - time , there are no poles in the theory that need removing above and beyond those found in physics on the simple conical singularity manifold described by metric ( 1 ) .",
    "however , for all @xmath318 the terms in the previous expression no longer all cancel , and there are additional ultra - violet poles in the theory , which must be removed .",
    "[ [ section-93 ] ]    the nature of these poles is easily deduced by examining the equations appearing earlier in this article . in mode expansion ( 8) ,",
    "for example , the mode frequency @xmath319 is seen to couple to the spin @xmath18 in the combination @xmath320 .",
    "since quantum theory involves an integration over all possible mode frequencies , this means that for _ any _ @xmath18 which is non - zero , a sufficiently high frequency mode will exist which makes @xmath320 of a significant size . examining equation ( 42 ) , which describes the integration over the mode frequencies",
    ", it can be seen that because part of the integrand is periodic , and does not fall off at high frequencies , the integrand is bounded by a gaussian envelope , which does not go to zero fast enough at small @xmath321 to supress the energetic modes and make the contribution to the effective action finite .",
    "additional supression ( and hence regularization ) is required to obtain a finite answer .",
    "the physical origin of the required additional suppression is also easy to understand . whilst it is reasonable to insist that the low frequency modes should couple with the spin like @xmath320",
    ", any spinning object has an angular frequency associated with its rotation , and one would not expect modes which have frequency much larger than the angular frequency to be greatly affected by the object s rotation .",
    "in other words , the interaction between the spin and the modes should fall off as the mode frequency increases , and this is precisely what the regularization procedure accomplishes .",
    "the simple boundary condition which allowed us to include spin in the conical space - time in the classical theory is therefore seen to be too powerful a constraint for the high frequency modes in the quantum theory , resulting in the appearance of additional ultra - violet divergences .",
    "[ [ section-94 ] ]    combining expressions ( 105 ) and ( 106 ) with terms ( 108 ) , and setting @xmath322 , we then obtain the finite piece of the integral of @xmath323 , which agrees with the result quoted in ( 60 ) .",
    "this type of regulation improves upon that used in section 10 , because it is clear from the argument presented here that there are no additional poles beyond those in the standard non spinning theory as @xmath184 .",
    "this is not readily apparent from expressions ( 84 ) and ( 85 ) .",
    "effectively in section 10 we neglected the occurence of @xmath324 in the denominators of several terms in ( 84 ) and ( 85 ) , because for @xmath325 @xmath324 is negligible compared to @xmath326 . however",
    "if @xmath183 then the @xmath324 factors come into play , and prevent the occurence of @xmath18 poles in the theory , replacing them with @xmath311 poles instead .",
    "these eta poles then cancel with the pole resulting from the s independent term , demonstrating that there are no additional divergences in the @xmath183 theory .",
    "[ [ section-95 ] ]    in conclusion , we note that the use of the more physical cylindrical shell source has successfully resolved most of the difficulties that have been traditionally associated with this space - time .",
    "models involving closed time - like curves always seem to contain a non - physical component , be it constituent matter which does not satisfy the energy conditions , or sources with unphysical amounts of angular momentum .",
    "once a more physically realistic system is considered , quantization proves possible , and new ultra - violet divergences are discovered , associated with the spin , which do not occur in the simple conical singularity case .",
    "these divergences are related to the interaction between the high energy modes of quantum fields propogating on the space - time and the source spin , but it proves possible to regulate them and renormalize the coupling constants of the theory so that a consistent description of the theory in all regimes of @xmath18 is possible .",
