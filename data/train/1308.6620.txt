    "note that although @xmath224 must be quadratic , the invariants of @xmath230 need not be quadratic , and thus the foliations need not arise from a howe dual pair .",
    "an example arises in @xmath252 with @xmath360 and @xmath429 .",
    "the only quadratic invariants of @xmath415 ( for generic @xmath430 ) are @xmath431 and @xmath432 , but the orbits of @xmath415 are 1-dimensional , and the third invariant @xmath433 is not quadratic .",
    "the integrators presented here are undoubtedly the simplest possible symplectic integrators for general hamiltonians on lie - poisson manifolds .",
    "the method is uniform in @xmath23 , but not in @xmath50 .",
    "this prompts several questions : can @xmath434 with @xmath435 be constructed algorithmically from @xmath50 ?",
    "can it be done canonically ? what is the minimum dimension of @xmath3 ?",
    "the second key requirement of the method is that the group orbits be fibres of quadratic functions ( or their intersection with invariant polyhedral sets ) , so we can ask the same questions under this restriction .    o.  verdier would like to acknowledge the support of the http://wiki.math.ntnu.no/genuin[genuin project ] , funded by the http://www.forskningsradet.no/[research council of norway ] , as well as the hospitality of the http://ifs.massey.ac.nz/[institute for fundamental sciences ] of massey university , new zealand , where some of this research was conducted .",
