    "the full description of the spin structure of the nucleon at twist - two level requires the knowledge of the transversity distributions , together with the helicity distributions  and .",
    "the transversity distributions  are difficult to measure since , being chirally odd , they decouple from inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "however , they can be measured in semi - inclusive dis ( sidis ) in combination with chiral - odd fragmentation functions , such as the collins fragmentation function @xmath2 for hadron production , giving rise to an azimuthal single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) in the final state hadrons  @xcite .",
    "the collins fragmentation function describes the spin - dependent part of the hadronization of a transversely polarized quark into a hadron with transverse momentum @xmath3 . at leading order",
    ", the collins mechanism leads to a modulation in the azimuthal distribution of the produced hadrons given by : @xmath4 where @xmath5 contains the apparatus efficiency and acceptance , @xmath6 is the target polarization , @xmath7 is the spin transfer coefficient and @xmath8 is the fraction of polarizable nuclei in the target ; @xmath9 is the collins angle , with @xmath10 the hadron azimuthal angle and @xmath11 the final azimuthal angle of the quark spin and @xmath12 the azimuthal angle of the nucleon spin in the @xmath13 system .",
    "finally @xmath14 is the collins asymmetry , arising from the product of the transversity distribution @xmath15 and the collins fragmentation function @xmath2 .",
    "a different mechanism  @xcite has also been suggested in the past as possible source of single spin asymmetries in the cross - section of unpolarized leptons impinging on transversely polarized nucleons . allowing for an intrinsic @xmath16 dependence of the quark distribution in the nucleon",
    ", a transverse spin polarization may induce a left - right asymmetry in such a distribution , giving rise to a measurable ` sivers asymmetry ' : @xmath17 with a modulation expressed in terms of the sivers angle @xmath18 . since in this case",
    "the unpolarized fragmentation functions are known , the measurement of the sivers asymmetry for both positive and negative produced hadrons allows directly to extract the sivers functions , if the measured asymmetry are different from zero , while a zero result for an isoscalar target like the @xmath0lid used in compass can come both from a vanishing sivers function or from a cancellation between @xmath19 and @xmath20 quark contributions .",
    "the event selection requires standard dis cuts , i.e. @xmath21 , mass of the final hadronic state @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and the detection of at least one hadron in the final state . for the detected hadrons it is also required that :    * the fraction of the virtual photon energy carried is @xmath24 to select hadrons from the current fragmentation region ; * @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the hadron transverse momentum with respect to the virtual photon direction ) for a better determination of the azimuthal angle @xmath10 .",
    "the asymmetries have been calculated as a function of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath26 for positive and negative hadrons respectively .",
    "both the resulting collins and sivers asymmetries from the whole deuteron data for all hadrons turned out to be small and compatible with zero  @xcite , a trend that is also shown by the identified hadron results  @xcite , a result which was interpreted as a cancellation between the contribution of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 quarks , for the isoscalar deuteron target .",
    "the new results for the proton target are shown in fig .",
    "[ results ] both for the collins ( upper row ) and for the sivers ( lower row ) asymmetries .",
    "the collins asymmetries as a function of @xmath27 are small , compatible with 0 , up to @xmath29 , while in the last points a signal appears , and the asymmetries increases up to 10% with opposite sign for the positive ( closed points ) and negative ( open points ) hadrons .",
    "the trend is in good agreement with what observed by hermes  @xcite . at variance",
    "the sivers asymmetries are small and compatible with zero over the full @xmath27 range and for both positive and negative hadrons ; in this case the compatibility with hermes results is fine for negative hadrons but is marginal , if any , for positive hadrons .",
    "the origin of the disagreement , needs to be understood  @xcite and will be an interesting issue for the near future .      00 the compass collaboration , p.  abbon _ et al .",
