    "the experimental setup was based on the atomic force microscope specially adapted for the measurement of the lateral casimir force .",
    "the measured force oscillates sinusoidally as a function of the phase difference between the two corrugations in agreement with theory with an amplitude of @xmath140n at a separation distance 221 nm .",
    "so small value of force amplitude measured with a resulting absolute error @xmath141n [ 25 ] with a 95% confident probability gives the opportunity to obtain constraints on the respective lateral hypothetical force which may act between corrugated surfaces .",
    "the obtained constraints [ 25,32 ] are shown in fig .  3 as the solid curve .",
    "in the same figure , the short - dashed curve indicates constraints obtained from the old casimir force measurements between dielectrics ( curve 8 in fig .",
    "2 ) , and the long - dashed curve follows from the most precision measurement of the normal casimir force between gold surfaces [ 21 ] ( these constraints were already shown by curve 9 in fig .  2 ) .",
    "the constraints obtained by means of the lateral casimir force measurement are of almost the same strength as the ones known previously in the interaction range 80nm@xmath142150 nm . however , with the increase of accuracy of the lateral casimir force measurements more promising constraints are expected .",
    "recently one more experiment was performed on measuring the normal casimir force . for this purpose",
    "the microelectromechanical torsional oscillator has been used .",
    "this permitted to perform measurements of the casimir force between a sphere and a plate with an absolute error of 0.3pn and of the casimir pressure between two parallel plates with an absolute error of about 0.6mpa [ 58,59 ] for separations @xmath143 m . as a result ,",
    "the new constraints on the yukawa - type corrections to newton s law of gravitation were obtained [ 59 ] which are more than one order of magnitude stronger than the previously known ones within a wide interaction range from 56 nm to 330 nm .",
    "these constraints are shown by curve 12 in fig .",
    "it is notable that the constraints given by curve 12 almost completely cover the gap between the modern constraints obtained by means of an atomic force microscope and a torsion pendulum . within this gap",
    "the constraints found from the old measurements of the casimir force between dielectrics ( curve 8 in fig .",
    "2 ) were the best ones .",
    "now they are changed to the more precise and reliable constraints obtained from the casimir force measurements between metals by means of a microelectromechanical torsional oscillator .    as is seen from figs .",
    "2,3 , the present strength of constraints is not sufficient to confirm or to reject the predictions of extra dimensional physics with the compactification scale @xmath144 mm ( line 13 in fig .  2 ) .",
    "however , fig .  2 gives the possibility to set constraints on the parameters of light hypothetical particles , moduli , for instance .",
    "such particles are predicted in superstring theories and are characterized by the interaction range from one micrometer to one centimeter [ 60 ] .",
    "in the above , the modern constraints on the constants of hypothetical interactions are reviewed following from the casimir force measurements and gravitational experiments .",
    "as is evident from fig .  2 , for separations smaller than @xmath145",
    "m much work is needed to achieve the strength of yukawa interaction predicted by extra dimensional physics ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "however , one should remember that casimir force experiments are also sensitive to other non - extra dimensional effects such as exchange by light elementary particles which can lead to the yukawa - type forces with @xmath146 ( see refs .  [ 9,16,60 ] ) .",
    "therefore , all experiments which can strengthen the constraints on constants of the yukawa - type interaction are of immediate interest to both elementary particle physics and gravitation [ 61 ] .    the following conclusions might be formulated .",
    "the idea of hypothetical interactions has gained recognition .",
    "new long - range forces additional to the usual gravitation and electromagnetism are predicted by the extra dimensional physics .",
    "they may be caused also by the exchange of light elementary particles predicted by the unified gauge theories of fundamental interactions .",
    "the modern measurements of the casimir force already gave the possibility to strengthen constraints on hypothetical long - range forces up to several thousand times in a wide interaction range from 1 nanometer to 100 micrometers .",
    "further strengthening of constraints on non - newtonian gravity and other hypothetical long - range interactions from the casimir effect is expected in the future . in this way",
    "the casimir force measurements are quite competitive with the modern accelerator and gravitational experiments as a test for predictions of fundamental physical theories .    in near future",
    "we may expect to obtain the resolution of the problem are there exist large extra dimensions and the yukawa - type corrections to newtonian gravity at small distances .",
