    "ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) whose infrared ( 81000 @xmath4 m ) luminosity exceeds 10@xmath5 @xmath6 are the sites where extraordinarily active star formation occurs in their central regions , triggered by galaxy mergers @xcite . since such galaxies have been also found as massive , dusty galaxies at high redshift , providing substantial star formation in early universe @xcite , it is important to understand their physical origins unambiguously .",
    "originally , @xcite proposed that ulirgs come from a merger between two ( gas - rich ) galaxies . on one hand ,",
    "multiple merger scenarios have also been proposed for the formation of ulirgs based on their morphological and dynamical properties @xcite . unlike well - defined , on - going merging systems such as the antennae ( ngc 4038 + ngc 4039 )",
    ", most of ulirgs appear to have complicated morphological properties of so - called advanced mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "namely , the following questions have not yet been unsettled unambiguously for the origin of ulirgs .",
    "( 1 ) how many galaxies were merged into one ? ( 2 ) which types of galaxies were merged into one ? ( 3 ) how were their orbital parameters ?",
    "since the merging of galaxies can smear out morphological properties of original galaxies that take part in the merger , it is generally difficult to give firm answers to the above questions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that a major merger between two galaxies may be a site of multiple mergers because any galaxies have their satellite galaxies ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for example , let us imagine a case of the merger between our galaxy and m 31 .",
    "since both galaxies have two significant satellite galaxies ( lmc and smc for our galaxy and m32 and ngc 205 for m31 ) , this major merger includes six galaxies .",
    "since a minor merger also gives dynamical disturbance to its host disk galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it seems to have a unambiguous discrimination between a major merger between two galaxies and a multiple merger .",
    "it is also worthwhile noting that numerical simulations of multiple mergers can make an arp 220-like morphology during the course of mergers among six galaxies @xcite .",
    "a one - sided long tidal tail structure ( e.g. , mrk 273 ) can also be generated by a multiple merger model @xcite .    among the ulirgs in the local universe , arp 220",
    "is the archetypical advanced merger @xcite .",
    "arp 220 shows two starburst events at least ; one is the central super star clusters ( i.e. , the on - going starburst ; @xcite ) , and the other is the figure  8 \" shaped structure of ionized gas driven by a superwind @xcite .",
    "it is also suggested that there is a hidden starburst core in the central region of arp 220 that is obscured seriously , @xmath7  50 mag ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , multi - phase star formation events in arp 220 and other ulirgs have been identified in more recent imaging and spectroscopic investigations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , arp 220 appears to have experienced a long history of episodic starbursts during the course of merging within last @xmath2 1 gyr .",
    "this complicated star formation history in arp 220 may come from a multiple mergers including more than two galaxies ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "it is generally difficult to explore the history of such multiple mergers in an advanced merger phase .",
    "however , since arp 220 shows the evident on - going and past starburst events noted above together with a faint pair of tidal tails , it is worthwhile investigating its star formation history in more details .",
    "for this purpose , we have carried out deep h@xmath0 imaging using the subaru telescope and a long - slit spectroscopic observation with the keck ii telescope .",
    "based on our new observations , we discuss a possible scenario for the star formation history in arp 220 and re - visit a multiple merger scenario .",
    "we use the distance of 77.6 mpc toward arp 220 that is estimated with both the systemic velocity of 5434 km s@xmath8 @xcite and a hubble constant @xmath9 = 70 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 . at this distance",
    ", 1 corresponds to 376 pc .",
    "in order to understand the whole star formation history in arp 220 , one efficient method is to reveal post - starburst regions ( their characteristic ages are @xmath2 0.2  1 gyr ) as well as the on - going active star forming regions ( their characteristic ages are @xmath10 10 myr ) . for this purpose",
    ", we obtained deep h@xmath0 on - band and off - band frames using the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ) on the subaru telescope on 2002 september 15 ( ut ) .",
    "total integration time for the on and off bands were 8400 seconds and 2400 seconds , respectively .",
    "the center wavelengths and bandwidths were 6709  and 85  and 6588  and 73  for the on and off bands , respectively .",
    "the on - band frames include stellar continuum emission and h@xmath0+[]@xmath116548,6583 line emission , while the off - band frames include stellar continuum only .",
    "bias subtraction , flat - fielding , and sky subtraction were performed .",
    "flux calibration was carried out by using sdss spectrum @xcite of a galaxy in the same field of view . in continuum subtraction",
    ", we took consideration into the continuum slope between the h@xmath0 on and off wavelengths estimated from keck spectrum around eastern h@xmath0 absorption region ( see section [ sec : result ] ) .",
    "this correction was applied to the whole region of the off - band image , and reduced continuum intensity by 2 % or h@xmath0 equivalent width by @xmath2 1.5  than if we assume no continuum slope correction , or flat continuum .",
    "since the eastern h@xmath0 absorption region and the two tidal tails have the same @xmath12 color indices ( section [ sec : result ] ) , this continuum correction is reasonable .",
    "the spatial resolution of focas images was 0.7 .",
    "deep @xmath13-band frames of arp 220 were also obtained by subaru prime focus camera ( suprime - cam ) on 2004 february 18 ( ut ) .",
    "bias subtraction , flat - fielding , and sky subtraction were performed .",
    "total integration time was 4200 seconds , and the spatial resolution was 1.0 . this @xmath13-band image was used to find faint tidal features around arp 220 ( see also , @xcite ) .",
    "a new optical spectrum was obtained by the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the keck ii telescope on 1997 april 16 ( ut ) .",
    "a 900-second exposure was taken with the 600 line mm@xmath8 grating , with a central wavelength setting of 6024  .",
    "the grating is blazed at 5000  and the dispersion is 1.28  pixel@xmath8 . the observed wavelength range and the spectral resolution were 4670  7210  and 6.9  , respectively .",
    "the 1 slit with a length of 66 was oriented at the position angle ( pa ) of 130 degree to observe both the nucleus of arp 220 and its visual companion d ( seen at se of arp 220 ) simultaneously .",
    "the spectrum was reduced by using iraf with the standard manner , i.e. , wavelength calibration , flat - fielding , and flux calibration ( see @xcite for detail ) .",
    "in post starburst regions , massive ob stars already ceased and thus intermediate - mass stars such as a - type stars are dominant populations .",
    "such regions are probed by strong hydrogen balmer absorption lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : image - focas ] shows the continuum - subtracted , smoothed h@xmath0+[]@xmath116548,6583 image , and the h@xmath0 equivalent width maps obtained by focas , respectively .",
    "we detect strong h@xmath0 emission from the central region of arp 220 and shell - like structures in both se and nw directions , as already reported in the literature @xcite . the strong h@xmath0 emission from the central region is considered to be attributed to the on - going starburst activity there . on the other hand ,",
    "the shell - like structures is due to the recent - past superwind , which is a galactic - scale outflow caused by many supernovae .    on closer inspection",
    ", we find three h@xmath0 absorption regions .",
    "one h@xmath0 absorption region is detected about 20 east from the center , inside the eastern h@xmath0 bubble .",
    "the observed equivalent width of h@xmath0 in the center 3 @xmath1 3 is 2.3  @xmath3 0.15  ( 1@xmath14 ) .",
    "the size of this region is approximately 5 kpc @xmath1 7.5 kpc .",
    "the other two spectacular h@xmath0 absorption regions appear to be associated with the two optically - faint tidal tails found in our deep @xmath13-band image ( see also figure [ fig : image - scam ] ) .",
    "the observed equivalent width of h@xmath0 amounts to @xmath2 5 @xmath3 0.4  in total ; @xmath2 4 @xmath3 1.1  at the continuum flux peak , and @xmath2 7 @xmath3 1.7  at the outer side of the tails ( figure [ fig : filament - profile ] ) .",
    "the sizes of the northern and southern h@xmath0 absorption regions are @xmath2 5 kpc @xmath1 10 kpc and @xmath2 6 kpc @xmath1 20 kpc , respectively . since these three regions show the h@xmath0 absorption feature , a - type stars , or post - starburst populations , are dominant in the optical continuum without h@xmath0 emission sources such as ob stars .",
    "figure [ fig : image - sdss ] displays arp 220 color index maps obtained from sdss images @xcite .",
    "we find that the three h@xmath0 absorption regions have almost the same color indices .",
    "furthermore , their color indices within several kpc except for the nuclear region are similar to those of the h@xmath0 absorption regions .",
    "these facts suggest that the dominant stellar population at these regions are the same , i.e. , post - starburst , which is consistent with @xcite and @xcite results .",
    "finally , we comment on an alternative interpretation that h@xmath0 absorption in the two tidal tails could be caused by the high extinction found in a number of ulirgs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the extinction is very high enough to hide on - going massive star formation , the observed optical light might be dominated by intermediate - type stars , resulting in strong h@xmath0 absorption with little emission line .",
    "although such situations may occur in the central parts of ulirgs including arp 220 @xcite , it seems unlikely that such very dusty starbursts occurred in the entire regions of both the eastern bubble and the two tidal tails .",
    "therefore , we consider that the post - starburst interpretation is a more robust idea for the observed h@xmath0 absorption regions in arp 220 .      the so - called lick index @xcite provides a common method for calculating an equivalent width .",
    "we therefore calculated the h@xmath15 lick index as a function of slit position .",
    "equivalent width was also calculated in the same way as that of lick index .",
    "note that we adopt the following wavelength coverage ; 6552.4  6564.6  for the on - h@xmath0 region , 6505.9  6525.44  and 6603.7  6664.9  for the off - h@xmath0 region .",
    "we chose these ranges in order to avoid the effects from [ ] @xmath116548,6583 emission from the object , other absorption lines , and sky emission .",
    "figure [ fig : ew - profile ] represents continuum flux density and equivalent width profiles along the slit position displayed in figure [ fig : image - focas ] . the h@xmath0 equivalent width at the southern part of the eastern bubble is @xmath2 1.5  , i.e. , h@xmath0 absorption , which is consistent with focas equivalent width map ( figure [ fig : filament - profile ] ) .",
    "the h@xmath15 equivalent width is more sensitive to post - starburst population than that of h@xmath0 , because the flux of the h@xmath15 emission line is generally about 3 times smaller than the h@xmath0 flux ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed h@xmath15 lick index of the eastern h@xmath0 absorption region is 3  4  .",
    "h@xmath15 absorption is detected not only around eastern bubble but also in the central region of arp 220 , @xmath2 @xmath16 and @xmath2 @xmath17 from the center ( figure [ fig : ew - profile ] ) .",
    "this fact suggests that post - starburst populations spread to several kpc in diameter , which is consistent with the results of both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we can not measure the h@xmath15 equivalent width of the west h@xmath0 absorption tails , because they were out of the field of view of lris .",
    "based on its morphology , it is obvious that arp 220 is now in an advanced phase of a galaxy merger @xcite . for arp 220 ,",
    "@xcite have discussed a possibility of multiple mergers .",
    "their argument is based on these facts that arp 220 has two compact starburst regions and that a pair of nuclei ( i.e. , a pair of supermassive black holes ) is necessary to initiate the so - called nuclear starburst in a merging system in either a minor or a major merger @xcite .",
    "this may be a plausible idea because the starburst is intrinsically different from ordinary star formation in galactic disks @xcite .",
    "the presence of multiple ( at least three ) oh megamaser sources can be interpreted as evidence for major mergers of four galaxies in arp 220 @xcite . however , although further observations detected multiple components , it is reminded that they do not necessarily suggest the multiple nuclei @xcite .",
    "one interesting advantage of the multiple merger model by @xcite is that they predicted the presence of a pair of counter rotating dense molecular gas disks before the actual observational detection by @xcite .",
    "arp 220 is a very gas rich system with @xmath18 and a half of gas is associated with two apparent eastern and western nuclei @xcite .",
    "it seems difficult to estimate orbital parameters of merging galaxies to explain all these observational results .",
    "however , the post - starburst tidal tails revealed by our our new observations presented here suggest a possible new idea on the merging history in arp 220 . for further consideration of multiple mergers , we discuss the origin of arp 220 .    here",
    "we focus on the origin of two post - starburst tidal tails .",
    "first , in antenna - like tidal tails , one tidal tail emanates from one colliding galaxy and thus two well - developed tidal tails are formed @xcite .",
    "taking this into account , we can postulate that two post - starburst systems merged into one and then the observed two post - starburst tails were formed in arp 220 .",
    "the observed smooth distribution of h@xmath0 absorption features requires this scenario although small - scale star formation activity could occur in gaseous tidal tails @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the size of each post - starburst system must be as large as several kpc at least , corresponding to a typical scale of disk galaxies .",
    "let us consider a probable star formation history in a major merger between two disk galaxies .",
    "during the course of such merger evolution , enhanced star formation events occurred , being triggered by inward gas flow driven by non - axisymmetries in the galaxy disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it should be reminded that the starburst events are essentially confined in the nuclear region of each galaxy ; i.e. , within only a few kpc diameter area . note that this is comparable to those of nuclear starburst regions in disk galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in order to make a pair of very large - scale ( @xmath2 10 kpc ) , post - starburst tidal tails observed in arp 220",
    ", we need two large - scale ( @xmath2 several kpc ) post - starburst disk - like structures .",
    "such a structure can be made in an advanced phase of a merger between two disk galaxies ; i.e. , a major merger remnant .",
    "we therefore strongly suggest that the observed two tidal tails in arp 220 need a merger between two advanced ( i.e. , post - starburst ) merger remnants .",
    "namely , we need four disk galaxies to explain the observed post - starburst tidal tails in arp 220 .",
    "we then conclude that arp 220 comes not from a typical merger between two galaxies but from a multiple merger including four galaxies at least .",
    "we estimate the travelling time of stars in the tidal tails from the merger center to the present place of tails . given both the velocity of tidally - liberated stars as 100 km s@xmath8 and",
    "the distance as 20 kpc , the travelling time is calculated as 200 myr , being consistent with the lifetime of post - starburst phase ( 0.2  1 gyr ) .",
    "our scenario for the evolution of arp 220 is summarized in figure [ fig : arp220-scenario ] .",
    "finally , we consider a possible unified picture for various star formation events in arp 220 . as shown in figure 1 , there are two more important starburst features in arp 220 ; one is the central starburst and the other is the pair of superbubble caused by the superwind activity @xcite .",
    "the central starburst must be occurred very recently , @xmath10 10 myr ago , being the life time of massive ob stars taken into account . on the other hand , since the dynamical timescale of the observed superbubble is estimated as a few tens myr ( e.g. , @xcite ) , arp 220 experienced another starburst a few tens myr ago .",
    "these star formation events correspond to those found in @xcite and @xcite ; i.e. , the young stellar population in @xcite and the constant - star - formation region occurring in the central kpc region of arp 220 @xcite .    in summary , taking account of the two post - starburst tails , we propose a unified evolution model for arp 220 as shown in figure [ fig : arp220-picture ] .",
    "these three starburst events could be driven by sequential multiple mergers in arp 220 .",
    "there are a significant number of compact groups of galaxies in the local universe @xcite , leading to multiple mergers .",
    "such compact groups of galaxies are also present in rich groups and outskirt regions of cluster of galaxies at intermediate redshift @xcite .",
    "moreover , a possible multiple merging system has been also found at @xmath19 1 @xcite .",
    "ulirgs are considered to evolve to quasars and then giant early type galaxies ( elliptical or s0 galaxies ) .",
    "a large number of high - redshift analogs of ulirgs , so - called submm galaxies ( smgs ) have been discovered beyond @xmath20 1 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although major mergers between only two galaxies have been often considered in terms of the hierarchical evolution of galaxies from high redshift to the present day , we will have to take the impact of multiple mergers into account in future consideration .",
    "we would like to thank the staff of subaru telescope for their professional help in our observations .",
    "we would also like to thank the hst / cosmos team members because the deep @xmath13-band image of arp 220 was taken during a break of our cosmos observing runs on the subaru telescope ; in particular , nick scoville , dave sanders , bahram mobasher , herve aussel , and peter capak .",
    "we would like to thank dave sanders and kirsten larson for useful discussion on the global optical color properties of arp 220 .",
    "finally , we would like to thank the referees for his / her useful comments and suggestions that improved this paper .",
