    "we , however , allow for a spin dependence of the tunneling rate which has been found to be an appreciable effect ( the asymmetry of the rates can be of the order of the rates themselves ) , most probably due to the exchange interaction in the lead  @xcite .    to expose the spin and charge dynamics , we introduce new variables , the probability of charge occupation , @xmath59 and the spin polarization , @xmath60 , and new parameters , for the average , @xmath61 , and the dimensionless asymmetry @xmath62 , in the tunneling rates , by writing @xmath63 , and similarly for the fermi factors , @xmath64 .",
