    "after the visionary work of poincar @xcite and the kam ( kolmogorov , arnold , and moser @xcite ) theory it became well established that non - integrability and hence chaos is a general rather than exceptional manifestation in the context of dynamical systems , see for instance @xcite . given this ubiquitous fact , an important issue in astronomical modeling is the study in which extent in phase space chaoticity rises in models that are relevant to describe real systems and what are its consequences .    the adequate description of the gravitation field of an astrophysical object has been an important subject in both relativistic and newtonian gravity since their origin .",
    "the particular case of the gravity associated to an axially symmetric body has played a central role in this discussion .",
    "recently , merrit @xcite found , from detailed modeling of triaxial galaxies , that most of the galaxies must be nearly axisymmetric , either prolate or oblate .",
    "in newtonian theory the gravitational potential of an axially symmetric body can be always represented by its usual expansion in terms of legendre polynomials ( zonal harmonics ) .",
    "the underlying theory in this case is the usual newtonian gravitation that for large masses and velocities is known to be less appropriate than einsteinian general relativity . in the late case",
    "the newtonian potential is replaced by the spacetime metric and newton motion equations by geodesics . in general relativity",
    "we have that the solution of the vacuum einstein equations associated to a static axially symmetric body has a simple form with only two metric functions @xcite and one of them admits an expansion in zonal harmonics . for rotating axially symmetric bodies we have a metric with three functions and",
    "two of them obey a sigma - model type of partial differential equations for which there are known methods of solution @xcite .",
    "the change of the particle motion equation and gravitational theory can produce dramatic effects , for instance , test particles moving in the presence of systems of masses that are integrable in newtonian theory are chaotic in general relativity , examples are : the fixed two body problem @xcite , and particles moving in a monopolar center of attraction surrounded by a dipolar halo @xcite .",
    "also gravitational waves , a non existing phenomenon in the newtonian realm , can produce irregular motion of test particles orbiting around a static black hole @xcite .",
    "another distinctive feature of general relativity is the dragging of inertial frames due to mass rotation .",
    "this fact is observed , for instance , in the impressive differences of the geodesic motion in schwarzschild and kerr geometries @xcite .    along this article",
    "we shall study the geodesic equations for particles evolving in the space time associated to a center of attraction with a quadrupolar deformation .",
    "the solution of the einstein equations representing this center of attraction  in the static case  can be found in @xcite wherein the rather misleading terminology `` distorted black hole '' was used to refer to such an object .",
    "examples of static centers of attractions with multipolar deformations are : a ) a true static black hole ( or a dense object ) surrounded by a distribution of matter like a ring or a small disk formed by counter - rotating matter , i.e. , built by approximately the same number of particles moving clockwise as counterclockwise .",
    "even though , this interpretation can be seen as a device to have a static stable configuration there is observational evidence of disks made of streams of rotating and counter - rotating matter @xcite .",
    "b ) an axially symmetric static dense object with either polar deformations or polar jets . in the case a ) we have oblate deformations .",
    "also the polar deformations of the sun and the inner planets in the solar system are oblate .",
    "we have prolate deformations in stars with jets and in some galaxy clusters @xcite . in the precedent cases , by adding rotation to the central black hole and removing the counter - rotating hypothesis we can have stationary centers of attraction with multipolar deformations .",
    "geodesic motions for axially symmetric spacetimes representing core - halos system were studied in @xcite for bounded motion and in @xcite for unbounded motions .",
    "the case of a slowly rotating center of attraction with a dipolar halo was considered in @xcite .",
    "the geodesic chaos for a disk with a central center of attraction was considered in @xcite . a core - halo system with nut ( newman - unti - tamburino ) charge",
    "was also considered @xcite .",
    "newtonian @xcite and pseudo - newtonian @xcite counter parts of some of this systems has been also studied . in a recent paper  within the newtonian realm  we studied chaotic motions of test - particles orbiting around a deformed body modeled by a monopolar and an internal quadrupolar term @xcite .    in this article",
    "we dwell in study of geodesic chaos , but now related to internal quadrupole deformations of the attraction center .",
    "note that halos are external multipolar contributions , their strength increases with the distance contrary to the internal ones that decreases with the distance .",
    "the quadrupolar contribution usually represents the major deviation to the spherical symmetry .",
    "thus , as a good first approximation , it can model most of the deformed sources .",
    "we shall analyze only bounded motions for specific choices of energy and angular momentum and certain values of quadrupolar strength that we believe will cover all the different typical situations . due to the symmetry of the problem",
    ", one can reduce the geodesic motion to a dynamical system with two degrees of freedom . for such cases ,",
    "the poincar section method is the most appropriated tool to study the geodesics general behavior .",
    "the paper consists of two main parts . in the first one , sec .",
    "ii , the exact solution to the einstein equations that represents a static axially symmetric source deformed by an internal quadrupole is considered . by using the poincar section method we numerically study the geodesic motion of test particles . for the prolate quadrupolar case we found chaotic motions contrary to the oblate case where only regular motion was found .    in the second part , sec .",
    "iii , the rotation of the attraction center is considered .",
    "we first study the metric that represents a rotating black hole deformed by a quadrupolar term .",
    "this metric is obtained as a two soliton solution in the context of belinsky  zakharov inverse scattering method @xcite that generates new solutions from a known one ( seed solution ) . as in the precedent section",
    ", geodesics were numerically studied using surfaces of section .",
    "the consideration of different cases leads us to conclude that the black hole rotation considerably alters the stability of the system .",
    "we obtain that the stability depends strongly on the relative direction of the spin of the center of attraction and the test particle angular momentum .",
    "we also found that the rotation does not alter the regularity of geodesic motions in the oblate case , i.e. , the orbits in this case remain regular .",
    "we conclude , in sec .",
    "iv , with further considerations on the stability of orbits .",
    "but , now we employ the method of lyapunov characteristic numbers following benettin et al .",
    "we also discuss the typical time to observe instability of orbits and make some final remarks .",
    "the metric of the spacetime related to the gravitational field of a static axially symmetric source is the one associated with the weyl line element , @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are functions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 only .",
    "the range of the coordinates @xmath5 are the usual ones for cylindrical coordinates .",
    "it is more convenient to use prolate spheroidal coordinates , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , that are related to weyl coordinates by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a constant , that will be associated with the mass of the center of attraction .",
    "the coordinate @xmath7 takes values in the interval @xmath10 $ ] ( it is essentially a cosine ) and @xmath6 runs from @xmath11 to infinity ( it is essentially a radial coordinate ) .",

    "the metric ( [ weylxy ] ) gives a third constant of motion ,    @xmath33    the motion of the test particle is completely determined by the solution of the two second order differential equations ( [ geo1 ] ) and ( [ geo2 ] ) .",
    "they define a four dimensional phase space , but the motion constants ( [ constmet ] ) and ( [ cte ] ) tell us that the motion is effectively realized in a three dimensional surface .",
    "moreover , these constants allow us to define an effective potential like function , @xmath34 thus the motion must be restricted to the region defined by the inequality @xmath35 .",
    "since the geodesic motion of the test particles is performed in a three dimensional effective phase space an adequate tool to study this motion is the poincar section method . as we mentioned before the sign of the quadrupole parameter @xmath25 specifies if the source is deformed in a prolate or in an oblate shape .",

    "the black hole rotation produces the pure relativistic effect of dragging of inertial frames .",

    "we do not find chaotic motion in this case .",
    "we were not able to obtain bounded motion for both large quadrupole strength and large rotation parameter .",
    "we studied bounded systems with large rotation speed ( of the order of 0.1 ) but with quadrupole strength always less than unit . in these cases",
    "the study of poincar sections leads to regular geodesic motion for co - rotation , as well as , counter - rotation .",
    "we also found that the confinement region may suffer an appreciable change in size and shape .",
    "as we said before , the exact solution to einstein equations presented in the two precedent sections are not new and different versions of them have already appear in the literature .",
    "we have presented them in this work for two reasons : a ) for easy reference , and b ) mainly , because for numerical analysis we need a faultless solution .",
    "the one presented here were derived using algebraic computation and checked using the full vacuum einstein equations in each case .",
    "besides the poincar section , we have another technique to quantify geodesic instability : the lyapunov characteristic number , @xmath81 , defined as , @xmath82 , \\label{lcn}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 and @xmath84  are the deviation of two nearby orbits at times @xmath85  and @xmath86 respectively . using the technique suggested by benettin et al .",
    "@xcite  who studied numerical problems in the computation of lyapunov exponents and kolmogorov entropy  one can get the largest @xmath87 .    using the constants that define the bound region presented in fig .",

    "[ ps1 ] we get always @xmath92 .",
    "this shows , as expected , that the lyapunov coefficient in the regions with chaotic motion does not vanish while in the region with irregular motion it could vanish .",
    "nevertheless , the value of the coefficient for chaotic motions is very small , it means that the dispersion of the orbits is slow if compared with local fluctuations in the mean potential .",
    "we found chaotic geodesic motions for the system black hole plus internal quadrupole for a very small range of parameters , specifically when there is a second bounded region .",
    "when one considers a rotating source one just re - obtained the same behavior studied in @xcite for rotating centers of attraction with halos .",
    "the orbits of counter - rotating particles are more unstable that the orbits for corotating particles . in reference",
    "@xcite the case of slow rotation was considered .",
    "we also studied some bounded chaotic motion for large rotation speed ( @xmath93 ) in a kerr halo system from an exact solution that represents an external dipole plus a kerr black hole . using the techniques presented in this paper",
    "we conclude that the irregularity introduced by external multipole terms are much larger than the ones introduced by internal multipole terms .",
    "we found also that chaotic motions for large rotation speed are more frequently , i.e. , we have irregular motion for a larger range of the constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "it is not easy to predict the role that chaos could have in measurable characteristics of galaxies .",
    "let us choose a parameter @xmath94 as the time to characterize the dynamics of the system e.g. , to draw the sections of an invariant torus in a regular motion or a chaotic region in the poincar section for irregular motion .",
    "we shall consider that this is the minimum time to have observable effects .",
    "rearranging the units to observable parameters , we obtain @xmath94 in years from the expression @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the number of steps in the simulations and @xmath97 is the mass of the central black hole ( in solar masses ) .",
    "the step @xmath96 varies for different systems .",
    "it is about @xmath98 for a black hole plus halo system and about @xmath99 for a black hole plus internal quadrupole system . for a typical galactic bulge",
    "we have @xmath100 then for black hole plus halo system we have @xmath101 which is a very small value when compared with galactic ages and for the black hole plus internal quadrupole system , @xmath102 which is a very large value compared with the universe age ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "consequently , chaotic relativistic effect may show up in the formation of structures in a black hole plus external halo system , work along this line will soon be reported .",
    "the relativistic effect due to the rotation of the source may be important .",

    "<S> the exact solution to the einstein equations that represents a static axially symmetric source deformed by an internal quadrupole is considered . by using the poincar section method we numerically study the geodesic motion of test particles . for the prolate quadrupolar deformations we found chaotic motions contrary to the oblate case where only regular motion is found . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the metric that represents a rotating black hole deformed by a quadrupolar term . </S>",
    "<S> this metric is obtained as a two soliton solution in the context of belinsky  zakharov inverse scattering method . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of geodesics depends strongly on the relative direction of the spin of the center of attraction and the test particle angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation does not alter the regularity of geodesic motions in the oblate case , i.e. , the orbits in this case remain regular . </S>",
    "<S> we also employ the method of lyapounov characteristic numbers to examine the stability of orbits evolving around deformed nonrotating centers of attraction . the typical time to observe instability of orbits </S>",
    "<S> is analyzed . </S>"
