    "<S> thz and infrared spectroscopy is widely utilized to investigate the electrodynamic properties of the novel iron - based superconductors in the normal and superconducting states . besides electronic excitations and correlations , electron - phonon coupling and the influence of magnetism , the experiments yield important information on low - lying excitations and help to clarify the number and symmetry of superconducting gaps . while the experimental data of different groups converge , the interpretation is still under debate . </S>",
    "<S> here we review the status of optical investigations on the superconducting state for the 122 and 11 family of iron pnictides .    superconducting energy gap , iron pnictides , optical spectroscopy , order parameter    74.25.gz , 74.70.xa , 78.20.-e </S>"
