    "most galaxies , especially late type spirals , are observed to be rotating .",
    "any robust theory of structure and galaxy formation needs to thus account for the origin of angular momentum . in physics in general and hydrodynamics in particular ,",
    "rotation is often associated with vorticity .",
    "not surprisingly , the early ideas of @xcite attempted to attribute the rotation of spiral nebulae to a primeval vorticity .",
    "the so - called theory of cosmic turbulence suggested that density perturbations , out of which structure evolves , emerged out of primordial turbulence and that galaxies got their rotation from a primordial vortical flow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* cf . the excellent review of @xcite ) .",
    "these ideas were superseded by an alternative theory which has survived and emerged as the current standard model of cosmology : structure grows by the evolution of small primordial density perturbations via gravitational instability in an expanding universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by construction",
    "the primordial flow field is a potential flow ( thus curl - free ) and therefore an alternative model for the origin of the galactic spin needs to be invoked .",
    "the first such ideas were developed by @xcite and @xcite and then independently by @xcite , who suggested that tidal interaction between collapsing haloes may be responsible for galaxy spins .",
    "accordingly , the induced internal velocity field in the torquing objects , is a curl - free shear flow @xcite .",
    "it follows that the resulting angular momentum of cosmological objects is associated with a shear and not a vortical flow .",
    "the classical picture of the origin of angular momentum was expanded by tidal torque theory ( ttt , * ? ? ?",
    "this seminal paper forms the base for the standard lore of the origin of angular momentum in modern cosmology .",
    "ttt provides a framework for calculating the dynamics and statistics of the growth of the angular momentum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , it is the only framework that enables an analytical analysis of the growth of the angular momentum of dark matter ( dm ) halos .",
    "it does so by considering the growth of the lagrangian mass of dm halos within the linear theory of gravitational instability . yet",
    "ttt is of limited validity when considering highly non - linear virialized halos . using numerical simulations @xcite examined the growth of the angular momentum of the lagrangian mass associated with @xmath1 halos and found that ttt provides a useful description until around @xmath2 of the effective turn - around time . at @xmath1",
    "the relative error in the predictions for the magnitude of the spin is of the order of unity and the mean scatter in the misalignment between the simulated and the ttt predicted direction of the spin is @xmath3 .",
    "it is clear that non - linear effects weaken the applicability of ttt on the scale of virial halos .",
    "a close examination of ttt reveals that one of the model s most important tenets is the fact that the primordial flow field is curl - free and therefore that angular momentum emerges out of a shear flow .",
    "this principle clearly does not hold deep in the non - linear regime , where the cosmic flow field becomes vortical @xcite .",
    "this has prompted us to examine the possibility that the spin of halos is a result of the vorticity of the cosmic flow field on scales greater than the virial radius .",
    "this is line with recent efforts to understand the emergence of the cosmic web and the properties of dm halos in terms of the local differential properties of the cosmic flow field @xcite    connecting galaxy or halo properties to their environments is not a new idea , and has its roots in the seminal density - morphology relation of @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) have investigated the relation between halo spin and shape with the lss in numerical simulations using a variety of different techniques to define the cosmic web .",
    "@xcite used the velocity shear tensor to show that halo spin tends to be perpendicular to the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the shear - the direction of greatest collapse ( or , in voids , of weakest expansion ) .",
    "it is therefore natural to extended these ideas to the anti - symmetric part and examine how the direction of the curl of the velocity field is distributed relative to the eigenvectors of the shear tensor and halo spin .",
    "the same dm only simulation is used here as in @xcite .",
    "it follows the evolution of @xmath4 particles in a @xmath5mpc periodic box employing standard wmap5 , @xmath6cdm cosmological parameters with a mass resolution of @xmath7 and a spatial resolution of 1@xmath8kpc .",
    "the halo finder ahf @xcite is run on the @xmath1 particle distribution . around @xmath9",
    "haloes more massive than @xmath10 are considered here .",
    "the velocity field is evaluated using the clouds - in - cell ( cic ) approach calculated on a 256@xmath11 grid giving a spatial resolution of 250@xmath8kpc .",
    "the cic gridding of the velocity field has been performed after excising the dm particles that make up virial halos .",
    "the rationale for that is to avoid double counting effects when relating the properties of halos with the their ambient velocity field .",
    "differentiation of the velocity field is performed in fourier space , using an fft . the cic velocity field is gaussian smoothed with kernel lengths of @xmath12kpc , 500@xmath8kpc and 1000@xmath8kpc .",
    "a given smoothing length is then matched to the appropriate halo mass been , such that @xmath13 roughly equals four virial radii .",
    "the velocity field @xmath14 at each point in space may by expanded as the sum of symmetric and anti - symmetric components .",
    "the symmetric component is the shear tensor : @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the hubble constant . since @xmath21 is symmetric its eigenvalues ( @xmath22 ,  @xmath23 ,  and @xmath24 ) are real and its trace is equal to the divergence of the velocity , which is proportional to the overdensity in the linear regime .",
    "the number of positive ( negative ) eigenvalues corresponds directly to the number of axes along which matter is contracting ( expanding ) . if zero , one , two or three axes are simultaneously collapsing , the region may be classified as a void , sheet , filament or knot ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "these axes are just the eigenvectors of the shear tensor ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "the anti - symmetric component of the expansion is the vorticity @xmath28 defined as the curl of the velocity field : @xmath29 .",
    "vorticity generation is a strongly non - linear effect , shown by @xcite to appear only in third order lagrangian perturbation theory .",
    "initial perturbations are assumed to be effectively curl - free since in an expanding universe conservation of angular momentum implies that any vortical flow will decay linearly .",
    "haloes are divided into three mass bins : low mass ( @xmath30 ) , intermediate mass ( @xmath31 ) and high mass ( @xmath32 ) . the median halo virial radius ( and standard deviation ) of each mass bin",
    "are @xmath33kpc , @xmath34kpc , and @xmath35kpc , respectively .",
    "the alignment between halo spin and the vorticity is examined on scales @xmath36 using the smallest ( 250@xmath8kpc ) , intermediate ( 500@xmath8kpc ) and largest ( 1000@xmath8kpc ) gaussian smoothing kernel for the smallest , intermediate and largest mass bin , respectively .",
    "in this section the alignment of vorticity with the shear tensor eigenvectors is examined .",
    "the probability distribution of the angle formed between the vorticity vector and each of the three eigenvector of the shear tensor at each grid point in the simulation is shown in fig  [ fig : align - pd](a ) .",
    "since the eigenvectors of the shear denote axes ( not directions ) , the interval is confined to @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "fig  [ fig : align - pd](a ) clearly shows that the vorticity tends to strongly align perpendicular to @xmath25 and in the @xmath38 plane , evidenced by the highly non uniform distributions . the apparent parallel alignment with @xmath26 and @xmath27 is driven by the perpendicularity with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "note that there is a slight tendency for the vorticity to be more closely aligned with @xmath27 , than @xmath26 , indicating a non - uniform azimuthal distribution .",
    "the significance of the alignment is quantified by calculating the average offset between the measured distribution and a uniform one , in units of the poisson error @xmath39 per bin of a uniform distribution . if less than unity , the measured distribution is consistent with random .",
    "all three alignments in fig .",
    "[ fig : align - pd](a ) show a @xmath40 statistical significance indicating they are fully inconsistent with a random distribution .",
    "the median angles between the vorticity and @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are 0.29 , 0.60 and 0.54 , respectively . _",
    "the vorticity of the velocity field tends to be perpendicular to the main axis of the shear and lie in the plane of the intermediate and minor axis_.    the alignment between the vorticity and the eigenvectors of the shear tensor is also shown for each cosmic web environment as the thin lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : align - pd](a ) .",
    "the perpendicular alignment between @xmath28 and @xmath25 decreases in strength from sheets , to filaments , to knots .",
    "this is likely due to the increased erratic behavior of these vectors deep in non - linear regimes .",
    "regardless of which web element is examined , @xmath28 tends to cluster more towards @xmath27 than @xmath26 and always away from @xmath41 .",
    "given the dominance of the shear tensor in shaping the local dynamics it is only natural to study the orientation of the vorticity with respect to its three eigenvectors .",
    "since the eigenvectors are non - directional lines ( axes ) the coordinate system they define does not span the full three - dimensional volume , but just the positive octant of the cartesian grid . each vorticity vector can thus be normalized to unity , and its direction projected onto a unit sphere defined by the eigenvectors .",
    "the distributions of @xmath28 on ( one eighth of ) the unit sphere can be seen in an equal area projection in fig .",
    "[ fig : projection ] .",
    "the perpendicularity with respect to @xmath25 is clearly visible as the vorticity tends to inhabit regions close to the @xmath26-@xmath27 plane ( the `` equator '' ) . as exemplified by the stronger parallel alignment between @xmath28 and @xmath27 in fig .",
    "[ fig : align - pd](a ) , at low latitude ( i.e. for @xmath28 s that are far from @xmath25 ) , the vorticity is closer to @xmath27 than to @xmath26 . at higher latitudes ,",
    "the locus of vorticity vectors is more uniform moving closer to @xmath26 at the highest latitudes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : slice ] we present the vorticity and shear field around a generic overdensity in a @xmath42mpc region . in overdense regions ( where the vorticity is well defined ) @xmath25 tends to point in the same direction across many mpc , indicating that the axis of greatest collapse is correlated on these scales . in the same region ,",
    "the perpendicularity of the vorticity and @xmath25 is clearly visible .",
    "since @xcite showed that halo spin axes tend to align with the principle axes of the shear tensor , and in the preceding section a correlation between the shear eigenvectors and the vorticity was shown , the alignment of vorticity and halo spin is now examined",
    ". such an alignment would be indicative of a rotational flow , rather than the classical picture that haloes form out of a potential , irrotational flow . in fig .",
    "[ fig : align - pd](b ) we show the alignment of halo spin with the vorticity for three halo mass bins .",
    "note that in this case the angle is between two vectors and as such allowed to range from [ -1,1 ] .",
    "[ fig : align - pd](b ) shows a clear correlation of halo spin with vorticity for all mass bins .",
    "the strength of this alignment is mass dependent , with larger halo spin being more tightly aligned with the vorticity : the smallest , intermediate and highest mass bins have medians of @xmath430.11 , 0.22 , and 0.37 . for the smallest mass bin ,",
    "the haloes have the weakest alignment , yet display the strongest signal ( @xmath44 ) statistically speaking , since this mass bin contains the largest number of haloes .",
    "the highest mass bin is inconsistent with a random distribution at the @xmath4598% confidence level and shows the strongest alignment . _",
    "halo spin is strongly correlated with the large scale vorticity of the velocity field_.",
    "using a high resolution cosmological simulation the relationship between halo spin and the relevant directions that characterize the large scale structure ( lss ) is studied .",
    "the velocity field has been evaluated on a smoothed , clouds - in - cells grid .",
    "the local differential behavior of the velocity field is then accounted for , at each grid cell , by the symmetric and antisymmetric components .",
    "the directions of the vorticity , the eigenvectors of the shear tensor ( which represent directions of collapse or expansion ) and halo angular momentum have been compared .",
    "the main findings are threefold :    1 .",
    "halo spin is strongly correlated with the direction of the local vorticity on scales @xmath46 .",
    "the strength of the correlation is mass dependent , with the most massive haloes being the most aligned with the vorticity .",
    "the direction of the vorticity tends to be perpendicular to the shear eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue ( @xmath47 ) . in all web environments except voids ( namely knots , filaments and sheets )",
    "@xmath47 corresponds to the axis of fastest collapse . in voids",
    "@xmath47 corresponds to the axis of slowest expansion .",
    "the strength of both alignments depends only weakly on the web classification and the general trends are found throughout the simulated volume .",
    "a key element of the standard model of cosmology is that structure emerges out of rotation - free gaussian primordial perturbations into a homogenous and isotropic universe .",
    "it follows that the early dynamical phase of halo growth is characterized by being a shear , curl - free , ( potential ) flow .",
    "tidal torque theory ( ttt , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides the theoretical framework to account for how the angular momentum of a halo s lagrangian mass grows at this early stage .",
    "however , as the lagrangian mass of a halo decouples from the hubble expansion , the flow field around the halo becomes more non - linear and more vortical ( see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that at about half the halo s turn around time , the growth of the halo s angular momentum no longer follows ttt s predictions . by analyzing a high resolution dm - only cosmological simulation",
    "we have shown here that at the present epoch the spin of simulated halos is strongly aligned with the vorticity of the large scale velocity field .",
    "this suggests that the acquisition of a halo s spin proceeds in two phases , before and after roughly half of the halo s turn around time . in the first phase the halo is in its linear and quasi - linear regime and the angular momentum grows out of an irrotational shear flow . in the second phase as the halo proceeds towards a virial equilibrium , it condenses out of a rotational , vortical flow . at that final stage",
    "the spin of a halo reflects the vorticity of the flow field of its immediate neighborhood .",
    "the orientation of galaxies and clusters with respect to the lss has been shown to be an important variable in the process of galaxy formation and has repercussions on for example , the correlation function ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "our findings of a strong alignment of halo spin with the vorticity , and the tendency of the vorticity to be orthogonal to @xmath47 regardless of the web classification , can thus be directly compared with observational studies .",
    "for example , @xcite reported that nearby disc galaxies ( including the milky way ) tend to spin within the super - galactic plane .",
    "on greater scales , showed that the orientations of clusters of galaxies are anisotropic with respect to the cluster distribution : prolate clusters are roughly parallel . using the 2mass survey @xcite reconstructed the observed shear field finding an alignment between galaxy spins and the intermediate axis .",
    "alignments have been examined in the sdss by @xcite among others : @xcite found that the spin of spiral galaxies is aligned with the filament axis ( i.e. perpendicular to @xmath47 ) .",
    "the orientation of spin with respect to voids is controversial : @xcite reported that disc galaxies located in shells surrounding voids , rotate preferentially in the shell .",
    "this was disputed by @xcite who found a distribution consistent with random .",
    "@xcite find that within specifically chosen shells , discs are aligned perpendicular to the void s radial direction . in our web classification scheme voids",
    "are bounded by sheets , for which the plane of the sheet is defined by @xmath47 . since the vorticity tends to lie within the plane of the sheet , it follows that halo spins are embedded within sheets - an alignment similar that found by @xcite .    much theoretical work",
