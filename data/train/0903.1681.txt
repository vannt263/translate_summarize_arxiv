    "a central goal of flavor physics is the determination of all elements of the ckm matrix  @xcite , magnitudes and phases . of the three angles of the @xmath12 ckm triangle , denoted @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 by some , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 by others ,",
    "the least - well determined is @xmath5 , the phase of @xmath19 relative to @xmath20 .",
    "it is of great interest to determine @xmath5 using the decay @xmath21 , since in this mode , the @xmath5 value obtained is expected to be insensitive to new physics effects in @xmath22 decays . here",
    ", @xmath23 is either @xmath0 or @xmath1 , and both decay to the same final state , and so their amplitudes add .",
    "sensitivity to the angle @xmath5 comes from the interference between two cabibbo - suppressed diagrams : @xmath24 , giving rise to @xmath25 , and the color and ckm suppressed process @xmath26 , giving rise to @xmath27 .",
    "one of the most promising @xmath23 decays for measuring @xmath5 using this method is @xmath28 , because it is cabibbo favored ( cf ) for both @xmath0 and @xmath29 decays , thus providing large event yields . to make use of this decay , however",
    ", the interference effects between @xmath30 and @xmath31 need to be understood .",
    "these interference effects can be understood and measured using cleo - c data .",
    "we first write the amplitude for the @xmath32 decay as follows :    @xmath33    here , @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the dalitz - plot variables in the @xmath23 decay , @xmath36 is the amplitude for @xmath37 decay to @xmath38 at @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the ratio of the suppressed to favored amplitudes , and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the strong phase shift between the color - favored and color - suppressed amplitudes . ignoring the second - order effects of charm mixing and cp violation  @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath43 , and eq .  [ eq : amp1 ] can then be rewritten as :    @xmath44    the square of the amplitude clearly depends on the phase difference @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the phase of @xmath47 .",
    "thus , for the determination of @xmath5 , one must know @xmath48 .",
    "previous analyses extracted @xmath48 by fitting a flavor - tagged @xmath3 dalitz plot to a model for @xmath0 decay involving various 2-body intermediate states @xcite .",
    "such an approach introduces a @xmath49 model uncertainty in the value of @xmath5 , uncertainty on @xmath5 in @xcite by combining @xmath50 and @xmath38 modes . ] which would be a limiting uncertainty for lhcb @xcite and future @xmath22-factory experiments .    in the analysis presented here , we employ a model - independent approach to obtain @xmath48 as suggested by giri _",
    "@xcite , by exploiting the quantum coherence of @xmath51 pairs at the @xmath2 .",
    "because of this quantum correlation , @xmath38 and @xmath52 decays recoiling against flavor tags , cp - tags , and @xmath3 tags , taken together provide direct sensitivity to the quantities @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "this measurement will result in a substantial reduction in the systematic uncertainty associated with the interference effects between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "giri _ et al . _ proposed @xcite a model - independent procedure for obtaining @xmath55 , as follows .",
    "the dalitz plot is divided into @xmath56 bins , symmetrically about the line @xmath57 .",
    "the bins are indexed from @xmath58 to @xmath59 , excluding zero .",
    "the coordinate exchange @xmath60 thus corresponds to the exchange of bins @xmath61 .",
    "the number of events in the @xmath59-th bin of a flavor - tagged @xmath38 dalitz plot from a @xmath0 decay is then expressed as :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is a normalization factor .",
    "the interference between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 amplitudes is parameterized by two quantities    @xmath64dxdy , \\label{eq : ci}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath65dxdy,\\ ] ]    where the integral is performed over a single bin .",
    "the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the amplitude - weighted averages of @xmath68 and @xmath69 over each dalitz - plot bin .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath66 and @xmath67 depend only on the @xmath0 decay , not the @xmath22 decay , and therefore these quantities can be measured using cleo - c data . in principle",
    "they could be left as free parameters in a @xmath70 dalitz - plot analysis from @xmath32 decays , but their values can be more precisely determined from correlated @xmath71 pairs produced in cleo - c .    though the original idea of giri _ et al .",
    "_ was to divide the dalitz plot into square bins @xcite , bondar _ et al .",
    "_ noted @xcite that increased sensitivity is obtained if the bins are chosen to minimize the variation in @xmath72 over each bin .",
    "thus , we divide the dalitz phase space into @xmath73 bins of equal size with respect to @xmath74 as predicted by the babar isobar model @xcite . in the half of the dalitz plot @xmath75 ,",
    "the @xmath76 bin is defined by the condition    @xmath77    the @xmath78 bin is defined symmetrically in the lower portion of the dalitz plot .",
    "such a binning with @xmath79 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasebin ] .",
    "one might suspect that because we are using a model to determine our bins , we are not free of model dependence .",
    "in fact _ any _ binning is correct in that it will give a correct , unbiased answer for @xmath5 , at the cost of larger uncertainties compared to an optimal binning with respect to @xmath74 .",
    "dalitz plot.,width=302 ]    we now describe how cleo - c data can be used to determine @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the event yields in the @xmath76 bin of both flavor - tagged and cp - tagged @xmath80 dalitz plot are required . because the @xmath2 has @xmath81 , the cp of the @xmath80 decay can be determined by reconstructing the companion @xmath23 in a cp eigenstate . with a cp - tagged @xmath80 decay ,",
    "the amplitude is given by :    @xmath82 , \\label{eqn : amp_cp_ks}\\ ] ]    for cp - even and cp - odd states of a @xmath80 decay .",
    "since the event rate is proportional to the square of this amplitude , the number of events in the @xmath76 bin of a cp - tagged dalitz plot is then :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is a normalization factor that depends on the number , @xmath85 , of single flavor - tagged signal decays , and the number , @xmath86 , of single cp - tagged signal decays .",
    "thus , access to @xmath66 is enabled by measuring the number of events , @xmath87 , in a cp - tagged @xmath38 dalitz plot , and the number of events , @xmath88 , in a flavor - tagged @xmath38 dalitz plot .",
    "unfortunately , as evident from eq .",
    "[ eq : ci ] , the sign of @xmath72 is undetermined in each of the @xmath59 bins .",
    "however , sensitivity to both @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be obtained by analyzing @xmath3 vs. @xmath89 data .",
    "the amplitude for @xmath2 decays to two @xmath38 decays is as follows :    @xmath90    the primed and unprimed dalitz - plot coordinates correspond to the dalitz - plot variables of the two @xmath80 decays . defining @xmath91 as the event rate in the @xmath76 bin of the first and the @xmath92 bin of the second @xmath80 dalitz plots , respectively",
    ", we have :    @xmath93    here , @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the number of @xmath96 pairs , and as before @xmath85 is the number of flavor - tagged signal decays .",
    "equation  [ eqn : ks_ks ] then relates the product @xmath97 to the measured yields of events in the flavor - tagged @xmath70 dalitz plot ( @xmath98 s ) and the yields in the @xmath3 vs. @xmath89 ( @xmath91 s ) dalitz plots .",
    "the sensitivity to this product leads to a four - fold ambiguity : change of sign of all @xmath66 or all @xmath67 . in combination with the cp - tagged analysis though",
    ", where the sign of @xmath66 is determined , this reduces to a two - fold ambiguity .",
    "one of the two solutions can be chosen based on a weak model assumption @xcite .",
    "the decay @xmath99 , due to its close relationship with @xmath3 , can be used to further improve the @xmath66 and @xmath67 determination .",
    "since the @xmath100 and @xmath101 mesons are of opposite cp , and we assume the convention that @xmath102 , it then follows that @xmath103 .",
    "then , for @xmath11 , the dalitz - plot rates of eq .",
    "[ eqn : cp_ks ] ( cp vs. @xmath3 ) and eq .",
    "[ eqn : ks_ks ] ( @xmath3 vs. @xmath4 ) become :    @xmath104 , \\label{eqn : ks_kl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for cp vs. @xmath99 and @xmath3 vs. @xmath105 , respectively , where @xmath106 , @xmath107 are associated with @xmath99 decay .",
    "for @xmath99 decays to benefit our determination of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , we must determine the differences @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "in addition to the relative sign change in eq .",
    "[ eqn : cp_kl ] and eq .",
    "[ eqn : ks_kl ] , doubly cabibbo suppressed decays ( dcsd ) of @xmath110 also contribute with opposite signs in @xmath3 and @xmath99 decays .",
    "we can see this by inspecting the @xmath0 decay amplitude for each dalitz plot    @xmath111,\\\\ a(k_l^0\\pi^+\\pi^- ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[a(k^0\\pi^+\\pi^-)-a(\\bar k^0\\pi^+\\pi^-)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the effect of this relative minus sign is to introduce a @xmath112 phase difference for all dcsd @xmath113 resonances in the @xmath52 model .",
    "we can use u - spin symmetry to relate the amplitudes for resonances of definite cp eigenvalue , e.g. @xmath114 .",
    "we find that these states acquire a factor of @xmath115 .",
    "to convert a @xmath3 model to the corresponding @xmath99 model , we multiply all dcsd amplitudes by @xmath116 and multiply each cp eigenstate amplitude by @xmath117 , with @xmath118 and @xmath119 fixed for every resonance ( here @xmath120 is the cabibbo angle ) .",
    "we then determine central values for the corrections , @xmath108 , @xmath121 using the @xmath122 babar model  @xcite .",
    "we ascribe uncertainty to both the choice of @xmath123 and @xmath124 , as well as the usage of the babar model to determine the uncertainties on @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the former are estimated by varying the phase @xmath124 between 0 and @xmath127 , and @xmath123 by @xmath128 .",
    "for the latter , we estimate @xmath125 and @xmath126 using the belle  @xcite and cleo  @xcite @xmath3 isobar model fits , and take the largest resulting deviation from the value found with the babar model as a model - dependent systematic uncertainty .",
    "the total systematic uncertainties in the corrections are the quadrature sum of these two uncertainties .",
    "the central values and uncertainties on @xmath125 and @xmath126 are shown in table  [ table : correction ] .",
    ".predicted values for @xmath125 and @xmath126 with the systematic uncertainties .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to see the impact of our results on the @xmath5 measurement , we generate toy monte carlo @xmath129 samples with @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the @xmath129 sample is large enough so that the statistical uncertainty associated with @xmath22 decays is negligible .",
    "we assume the reconstruction efficiency is 100@xmath133 and that no background is present .",
    "we fit for @xmath5 , @xmath42 , and @xmath40 10,000 times by sampling @xmath66 and @xmath67 according to their uncertainties and correlations .",
    "we find the width of the resulting @xmath5 distribution , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] , is about @xmath134 . however , a small bias of @xmath135 is observed , which is believed to be caused by the unphysical @xmath66 and @xmath67 pairs ( 617 out of 8000 ) with @xmath136 .",
    ".,width=188 ]    comparing with a model uncertainty of @xmath137 for babar  @xcite and @xmath138 for belle  @xcite , great improvement on the @xmath5 measurement can be achieved by using a model - independent approach incorprating cleo - c s results on the strong phase parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 presented in this article .",
    "this will be realized at lhcb where using 10 fb@xmath7 of data a _ statistical _ error on @xmath5 of @xmath139 is anticipated @xcite .",
    "the weight of @xmath140 in the combination of tree - level @xmath15 measurements at lhcb , which is predicted to have sensitivity of @xmath141 @xcite , depends upon the cleo - c s results on the strong phase parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 presented in this article .",
    "sensitivity to new physics is obtained through the comparison of @xmath5 measured directly in tree - level processes and indirect determinations of @xmath5 .",
    "one indirect determination , @xmath142 , arises from the intersection of the @xmath143 mixing and @xmath144 contours in the @xmath145 , @xmath146 plane @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty is dominated by the lqcd calculations for mixing @xcite and are expected to improve .",
    "another determination of @xmath5 follows from the unitarity constraint @xmath147 . here",
    "the uncertainty is dominated by the determination of @xmath148 from @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "in summary , using 818 pb@xmath7 of @xmath150 collisions produced at the @xmath2 , we make a first determination of the strong phase parameters , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , in table  [ table : ci_si - final ] . from a toy monte carlo study with a large sample of @xmath129 data generated with @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 ,",
    "we find that the decay model uncertainty on @xmath5 is reduced to about @xmath134 due to these new measurements . as a result , the precision of the @xmath5 measurement using @xmath151 decays",
    "will not be limited by the strong interference effects in the @xmath80 decay . the improved precision in the direct determination of @xmath5 enabled by this measurement of the strong phase parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 enhances sensitivity to new physics through the comparison with indirect determinations of @xmath5 .",
