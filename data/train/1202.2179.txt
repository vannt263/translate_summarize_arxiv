    "it is generally accepted that ` long ' ( @xmath7 s ) is the duration in which the cumulative counts are from 5% to 95% above background . ] gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are linked to the core collapse of massive stars ( collapsars ) @xcite . for several cases ,",
    "the grbs are firmly associated with type ib / c supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this strongly suggests that they are linked to the end point of massive stellar evolution .",
    "in contrast ` short ' ( @xmath8 s ) gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ) have a less certain origin .    the first breakthrough to understanding the nature of sgrbs was made in 2005 after the launch of the nasa _ swift _ satellite @xcite .",

    "binary neutron star mergers ( ns - ns ) or neutron star  black hole ( ns - bh ) mergers",
    "are favoured as the progenitors for sgrbs , based on the association of some sgrbs with an older stellar population , as compared to long grbs .",
    "evidence for the origin of sgrbs in the final merger stage comes from the host galaxy types ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "kicks imparted to nss at birth will produce velocities of several hundred km s@xmath6 , implying that binary inspiraling systems may occur far from their site of origin .",
    "fong , berger & fox ( 2010 ) using hubble space telescope observations to measure sgrb - galaxy offsets , find the offset distribution compares favourably with the predicted distribution for ns - ns binaries .    despite this progress , unambiguous identification of burst types continues to be a problem .",
    "the various ambiguities have motivated several authors to re - define different classes of grbs via a number of properties including : spectral features , associated supernova , stellar population , host galaxy , location in the host galaxy and progenitor type @xcite .",
    "some authors also suggest a third intermediate population of bursts based on the existing @xmath9 scheme @xcite with a lower than average peak - flux distribution @xcite .",
    "furthermore , work by @xcite shows that categorizing bursts as sgrbs based on @xmath9 is satellite dependent .",

    "we account for this uncertainty , and its effect on the intrinsic sgrb rate , we scale our sgrb rate estimates using a refinement of these probabilities that incorporates a power law fit to the bursts within the _ swift _ energy band .    around 20% of the sgrbs detected by _",

    "other candidate systems include the birth of a rapidly rotating proto - magnetar produced via ns - ns merger or accretion - induced collapse of a white dwarf @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we have considered separately the normal sgrbs and the sgrb - ee to take this uncertainty in the progenitor nature into account .",
    "sgrb observations could potentially play a more important role in constraining compact object merger rates on two fronts as more data become available .",
    "firstly , as a direct consistency check of the binary merger rates inferred from binary pulsars and population synthesis . secondly , as a constraint on the progenitor scenario and the engine that drives the emissions . both are critical issues for solving the puzzle of the origin of sgrbs and their links to compact object mergers .",
    "there are two popular but different methods employed for estimating ns - ns merger rates .",
    "the first uses extrapolation from the observed sample of ns binaries infered from pulsar observations @xcite ; the second uses population synthesis simulations @xcite , where several unknown model parameters are constrained by observations and others are assumed from theory .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter ab10 ) assessed the rates from these techniques , defining lower and realistic rate densities of 10 and 1000 @xmath3 respectively .",
    "these rates are uncertain by @xmath12 orders of magnitude because of the small number of observed galactic binary pulsars , and from poor constraints in population - synthesis models .    within 5 years ,",
    "co - ordinated gamma - ray , x - ray , optical and gravitational - wave observations may allow the strong gravity regime of the central engine of compact object mergers to be probed .",
    "such ` multi - messenger ' observations provide the opportunity to probe these events across a vast energy spectrum , and to constrain the progenitor populations of sgrbs .",
    "furthermore , co - ordinated optical and gravitational - wave searches may play an important role in confirming the first direct gravitational - wave observations of compact object mergers @xcite .",
    "it is becoming increasingly important to constrain the rate of compact object mergers and their proposed optical counterparts in the context of up - coming gravitational - wave searches .",
    "the scarcity of sgrb observations and the poorly understood biases in the current data have made it challenging to calculate the sgrb rate density with meaningful uncertainties .",
    "previous work using grb flux - limited samples either assumes , or derives models for , the sgrb luminosity function and rate evolution of the sources ; e.g. @xcite find a sgrb rate density of @xmath13 @xmath3 , assuming isotropic emmision .",
    "another study @xcite , calculates a higher ns - ns merger rate of about @xmath14 @xmath3 , but assuming the emissions are beamed with small opening angles .    in this study , we calculate a beaming - corrected sgrb rate density using the _ swift _ sample of sgrb peak fluxes , redshifts and inferred beaming angles from x - ray observations . for our grb selection criteria we use the jochen greiner catalogue of localized grbs ( see table 1 ) and select bursts indicated as short that have reliable redshifts up to 2012 april . from this selection of 9 bursts ,",
    "we omit the burst grb 090426 , which is possibly linked to the death of a massive star based on its galaxy off - set and optical and x - ray emissions .",
    "we note also that although grb 100816a has shown certain characteristics not consistent with a sgrb classification it can not be clearly ruled out ; additionally , its redshift of @xmath15 will not influence our results significantly .",
    "we avoid using a sgrb luminosity function , models for progenitor rate evolution , and a beaming angle distribution , all of which have large uncertainties . instead , we focus on observed and measured parameters that take into account selection effects that modify _",
    "swift__s _ detection sensitivity to sgrbs .",
    "finally , we use our sgrb rate density estimates to infer a detection rate of binary ns mergers by advanced ligo ( aligo ) and virgo interferomters . despite the poor statistics ,",
    "this approach gives meaningful results and can be followed up when a larger sample of sgrb observations becomes available .",
    "the currently favoured emission model for sgrbs is a compact object merger triggering an explosion causing a burst of collimated @xmath16-rays @xcite powered by accretion onto the newly formed compact object .",
    "the ultra - relavistic outflow is eventually decelerated by interaction with the interstellar medium to produce a fading x - ray and optical afterglow . after the jet lorentz factor @xmath17 decreases to @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the jet opening half angle , the afterglow becomes observable from viewing angles greater than @xmath19 .",
    "only two sgrbs have identifiable jet breaks ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) : grb 050709 ( @xmath20  detected by the _ hete _ satellite ) and grb 051221 @xmath21 .",
    "these beaming angles are not necessarily agreed upon , mainly because the afterglow jet break times obtained from x - ray or optical light curves are notoriously difficult to identify at late times , and the emissions are generally fainter in x - rays and optical compared to those of long bursts .",
    "furthermore , the inferred beaming angles are model dependent @xcite and sensitive to the circumburst environment .    for the following rate density calculations , we employ the standard fireball model ( e.g. sari et al . 1999 ) to estimate the jet opening half angle using the minimum jet break times from x - ray observations : @xmath22^{3/8}(n\\eta / e_{\\mathrm{iso}})^{1/8}\\ ; \\mathrm{rad},\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , the jet break time , is the time in days when the light curve decay index changes from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 is the circum - burst density , in @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the fraction of grb energy observed in the prompt emission , and @xmath29 is the prompt isotropic equivalent energy in @xmath30 erg .",
    "we assume an average of @xmath31 @xmath27 and @xmath32 for our sgrb sample .",
    "the circum - burst density for both long and short duration grbs is quite scattered , and typically ranges from ( 0.001 - 10)@xmath27 .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath26 for sgrbs is similar to the one derived for long bursts @xcite , implying that the local density should be similar for both collapsars and mergers .",
    "contrary to this , fong et .",
    "2012 ) argue that sgrbs are located in typically smaller circum - burst densities , supported by their constraint of @xmath33 @xmath27 for grb 111020a . for definiteness , we use 0.01 @xmath27 , to calculate lower limits on the beaming angle for sgrbs without a measured jet - break . alternatively ,",
    "for the sgrb - ee sample we use @xmath31 @xmath27 , because the only confirmed sgrb - ee with a jet break , grb 060614 , is constrained to @xmath34 @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of measuring jet breaks leads to a bias in obtaining jet angles favouring those bursts that have very bright x - ray / optical afterglows and/or relatively short jet break times .",
    "hence , the true average of the sgrb jet angle distribution will be greater than that based on the very small sample used in this work . nonetheless , given the lack of knowledge of the sgrb angle distribution , both theoretically and observationally , we choose to employ the small number of inferred sgrb beaming angles and lower limits from x - ray / optical observations .",
    "to extend the very small measured beaming angle sample , we constrain the minimum beaming angles for those sgrbs that have x - ray afterglow light curves available up to at least 1 day from the trigger .",
    "the following five sgrbs : grb 100816a , grb 071227a , grb 070714b , grb 061006 and grb 050724 satisfy this criterion .",

    "we note that these rates assume @xmath31 @xmath27 . if a smaller circum - burst density similar to the sgrb is used , the rates will increase by a factor of about 2 .",
    "it is interesting that the sgrb - ee rate density from this work is similar to the expected bh - ns merger rates from population synthesis models ( ab10 ) .    assuming a signicant fraction of binary ns mergers produce sgrbs , it is interesting to compare these rate estimates to the ns - ns merger rate density estimated from other work . our lower rate density , which assumes isotropic emission , is comparable to the isotropic emission estimates of @xcite , i.e. @xmath59 @xmath3 . our upper limit is comparable to estimates of beamed emission , @xmath60 @xmath3 . compared to ab10 , our limits of @xmath61 @xmath3 are similar to their low - realistic rate densities @xmath62 @xmath3 .",

    "]    our detection rate is similar to the lower and realistic rates based on population synthesis simulations using galactic pulsar observations .",
    "the rates are also compatible with those of guetta & piran ( 2006 ) , who employ a luminosity function and sgrb rate evolution .",
    "it has been suggested that the observed sgrb population is presently not a useful constraint on rate estimates for compact binary mergers ( ab10 ) .",
    "the justification of this argument stems from the fraction ( if any ) of binary ns mergers that will produce an sgrb .",
    "another issue is that sgrb observations by _ swift _ and subsequent follow - up in optical are affected by selection effects and uncertainty in the beaming angles .",
    "if sgrb / sgrb - ee have an intrinsic average beaming angle of @xmath70 , then the jet - break times may not occur until weeks after the burst , when the afterglow is too faint in the optical .",
    "the sgrb rate density depends on the spatial - distribution of the sources , but because redshift measurement depends on a bright afterglow , the spatial distribution is biased to the brighter bursts that are nearby @xcite .",
    "hence , for the majority of bursts with a faint afterglow , redshift measurement is more difficult .",
    "we attempt to crudely correct for this bias by boosting the calculated rate by the fraction of bursts without measured redshift to those with redshift , assuming the missing redshifts follow the same distribution as the observed redshifts .",
    "this assumption is reasonable ( in this work ) because the rate density is dominated by those faint bursts in the smallest @xmath48 .",
    "hence , there are two main sources of selection effects and biases .",
    "firstly , there are the satellite detectors , exemplified by the significant difference between batse and _ swift _ sgrb detection efficiencies .",
    "secondly , there is the problem of obtaining a redshift either from the host galaxy or the afterglow itself ( as highlighted above ) .",
    "we have shown that these detection biases should be considered when attempting to use the current ( and future ) sgrb detections for constraining rate evolution , rate densities and linking sgrbs to binary ns mergers .",
    "the binary ns gravitational - wave detection rate estimates are based on calculating an intrinsic sgrb rate density using _ swift _ localized bursts , taking into account dominant selection effects .",
    "this approach , based on observational data is very different from that based on galactic binary pulsar observations and modelled population synthesis . in the latter , ab10 use the observed galactic binary pulsar population and",
    "extrapolate a ns merger rate density out to the aligo and virgo detection horizon .",
    "conversely , our approach avoids this extrapolation because it is essentially an observed rate extending well beyond the average sensitivity distances of the upcoming gravitational - wave searches for compact binaries ( about 300 mpc or @xmath71 for aligo and virgo interferometers ) and , moreover , a significant fraction of sgrbs are observed in association with evolved stellar populations .    in conclusion , the upcoming gravitational - wave detection era will be fundamental for resolving the sgrb  binary ns merger connection , since an unequivocal association between sgrbs and binary ns mergers will only be possible via coincident gravitational - wave and electromagnetic observations . ultimately , a comparison beteween the sgrb rate density and the gravitational - wave detection rate will help constrain the fraction of binary ns mergers that give rise to sgrbs and the sgrb beaming angle distribution .",
