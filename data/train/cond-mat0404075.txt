    "there is renewed interest in the investigation of extended particles with exclusion interaction . the basic model , which will be referred to as the @xmath0-asep in the following , is a generalization of the well - studied asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite .",
    "it describes the motion of hard rods in one - dimensional discrete space by extended particles which move along a lattice according to stochastic hopping dynamics .",
    "the original concept of the @xmath0-asep was introduced in 1968 in a paper by macdonald and gibbs treating protein synthesis @xcite . during this process",

    "the attachment of the ribosomes to the m - rna for the initiation of the protein synthesis and their detachment at the point of termination are modeled by open boundaries , where particles may enter and exit the lattice with rates that differ from the bulk hopping rates . using mean - field theory",
    ", the authors studied the steady state of this process . more recently the time - dependent conditional probabilities @xcite , the dynamical exponent @xcite and the phase diagram of the open system have been determined @xcite .",
    "however , the understanding of symmetries of the model and of its hydrodynamic limit has remained incomplete so far . in @xcite a hydrodynamic equation is proposed phenomenologically , employing fitting parameters , which are matched to simulation data . in the present paper ,",
    "several basic physical and mathematical properties of the @xmath0-asep with periodic boundary conditions are derived from its microscopic dynamics , generalizing a mapping to the zero range process @xcite and employing quantum hamiltonian techniques @xcite . in particular , we obtain the hydrodynamic limit governing the density evolution of the @xmath0-asep on the euler scale .    the outline of this work is as follows : after introducing the two fundamental models ( @xmath0-asep and zero range process ) and reviewing some facts about their stationary properties in section [ asepzrp ] , the dynamics of the @xmath0-asep are studied by two different approaches : in section [ tracer ] , the investigation of the motion of a tagged particle in the framework of the quantum hamiltonian formalism leads to an expression for the average velocity and the time - dependent diffusion constant of the tracer particle .",
    "the velocity term is then confirmed by the general form of a hydrodynamic equation of the @xmath0-asep which is derived in section [ hd ] .",

    "the location of a particle on the chain is denoted by the location of its right end .    in figure [ rodspoints ] this model is compared to an equivalent description ( 1b ) , where each extended particle is composed of @xmath0 monomers . in the latter case , the initial states are restricted to those where particles are grouped in @xmath0-tuples at adjacent sites . hopping processes",

    "furthermore the zrp - picture will be of help when considering the motion of a tagged particle in section [ tracer ] .",

    "the main results can be summarized as follows : one - to - one mappings between @xmath0-asep , asep and a certain class of zrp have been stated explicitly .",
    "it has turned out very useful to exploit those transformations in order to derive basic properties of the @xmath0-asep , in particular the time - dependent diffusion constant for a tracer particle and the hydrodynamic equation for the local density evolution .",
    "a tagged @xmath0-asep particle shows the type of subdiffusive behaviour as known for the case @xmath2 of the asep .",
    "the extension of the particles as a new feature becomes manifest in the prefactor of the diffusion constant , which has been calculated as a function of the particle density .",
    "the methods applied are suitable for a generalization to any process which can be mapped onto some zero range process . as a most important outcome of the mapping ,",
    "the hydrodynamic equation of the @xmath0-asep has been deduced from microscopic properties of the discrete system .",
    "the resulting nonlinear and convex current - density relation ( for finite @xmath0 ) is qualitatively similar to that of the asep , but it also shows some new features : it is asymmetric for @xmath273 . the symmetry of particle and hole density is broken .",
    "the hydrodynamic equation has a natural form for @xmath197 if expressed in terms of the particle density and of a generalized average particle velocity .",
    "all results obtained for the @xmath0-asep also hold for a polydisperse system of particles of arbitrary length where the length parameter @xmath0 must be replaced by an average length @xmath274 .",
    "+ in the case of @xmath2 , it is known how to link some hydrodynamic properties of the asep to the algebraic structure of the stochastic many - body system . especially for the case of symmetric hopping rates ( sep ) ,",
    "the @xmath1-symmetry has proved a valuable attribute . in this work",
    ", the @xmath1-symmetry has been established for the case of extended particles ( @xmath0-sep ) .",
    "a formalism has been introduced in which all sep - operators may be generalized to @xmath0-sep operators under the condition of zrp - equivalence ."
