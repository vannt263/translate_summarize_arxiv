    "the presence of an amplitude with a different weak phase ( such as from a `` penguin '' diagram ) gives rise to direct @xmath2 violation and shifts @xmath29 from @xmath32 .",
    "however , the size of the loop amplitude is constrained by the branching fraction of @xmath33  @xcite , indicating that this effect is small .",
