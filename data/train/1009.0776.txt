    "dark energy ( de ) models aim to explain the accelerated expansion rate of the universe at late times .",
    "this phenomenon was originally discovered using supernovae ia ( snia ) data @xcite and has since then been confirmed by many other observations ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . still , the nature of dark energy , and the precise physical mechanism producing the accelerated expansion remains to date an outstanding mystery for cosmologists and for theoretical physicists .",
    "the @xmath0cdm model , based on a cosmological constant and cold dark matter , appears to be in good agreement with most of the present observational data on large cosmological scales .",
    "however , this model has well known theoretical problems @xcite and it also encounters difficulties in explaining some of the data on the scales of structures and even on very large scales , like peculiar flows ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "alternatives to the @xmath0cdm model are dark energy models with a time varying equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath1 @xcite , and these are not yet excluded by data . in this context , many scalar field models have been considered , either minimally coupled with a standard kinetic term , or more complicated ones , e.g. dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) models with kinetic terms involving a square root @xcite .",
    "interest in dbi type models was revived in the framework of string theory , where the respective scalar fields are called tachyons @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these models are possible dark energy candidates , as they can be interpreted as perfect fluids with a sufficiently negative pressure in order to produce the late - time accelerated expansion",
    ".    there is a large arbitrariness in the choice of the potential for tachyonic cosmological models . in ref @xcite ( to be referred henceforth as *",
    "i * )  a specific tachyon potential , containing trigonometric functions , was considered .",
    "this model turns out to be surprisingly rich , in that it admits a large variety of cosmological evolutions depending on the choice of initial conditions .",
    "thus , in * i * two interesting properties were found .",
    "first , for positive values of the model parameter @xmath2 , the sign of the pressure can change during evolution .",
    "second , while under certain initial conditions the universe will expand indefinitely towards a de sitter attractor , under different initial conditions , after a long period of accelerated expansion the pressure becomes positive and the acceleration turns into deceleration .",
    "accordingly , the tachyon field will drive the universe towards a new type of cosmological singularity , the big brake , characterized by a sudden stop of the cosmic expansion . at this singularity ,",
    "the universe has a finite size , a vanishing hubble parameter and an infinite negative acceleration .",
    "in contrast to this dynamical picture , similar evolutions were analyzed earlier from a purely kinematical standpoint and named sudden future singularities @xcite . as already stressed earlier for some tachyon models @xcite , the addition of dust is a non - trivial problem as is also the behavior of the model at the level of perturbations .",
    "so our model can not be viewed yet as a fully viable cosmological scenario but rather as a toy model that could lead to a viable one after suitable improvements . in a recent paper @xcite ( to be referred henceforth as * ii * )",
    "we have confronted our tachyon cosmological model with snia data @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the strategy was the following : for fixed values of the model parameter @xmath2 , we scanned the pairs of present values of the tachyon field and of its time derivative ( points in phase space ) and we propagated them backwards in time , comparing the corresponding luminosity distance - redshift curves with the observational data from snia .",
    "then , those pairs of values which appeared to be compatible with the data , were chosen as initial conditions for the future cosmological evolution . though the constraints imposed by the data were severe , both evolutions took place : one very similar to @xmath0cdm and ending in an exponential ( de sitter ) expansion ; another with a tachyonic crossing where the pressure turns positive from negative , ending in a big brake .",
    "it was found that a larger value of the model parameter @xmath2 enhances the probability to evolve into a big brake . for a set of initial conditions favored by the snia data , we have also computed in * ii * the time to the tachyonic crossing , and the big brake , respectively .",
    "these time - scales were found to be comparable with the present age of the universe .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first we propose to shed more light on the evolution of the tachyon field in the distant and in the more recent past ; and second , to explore in detail what happens when the universe reaches the big brake . as",
    "this singularity is a soft one , with only the second derivative of the scale factor diverging , it is expected that it may be possible for geodesic observers to cross the singularity .",
    "indeed , the traversability of a rather generic class of sudden future singularities by causal geodesics was put in evidence in @xcite .",
    "strings can also pass through @xcite .",
    "in section ii we consider the late - time evolution of the tachyon field , its energy density @xmath3 , pressure @xmath4 and eos parameter ( barotropic index ) @xmath1 defined as @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , we investigate whether some observable signature today may point towards a big brake singularity in the future .    in section iii",
    "we discuss the big brake singularity , both in terms of curvature characteristics and by analyzing the geodesic deviation equation . in section",
    "iv we discuss what happens to the tachyon universe after the big brake .",
    "finally , we summarize our results with some comments in the concluding remarks .",
    "first , we briefly give the basic equations of tachyon cosmology .",
    "the lagrangian of a tachyon field is @xmath6where @xmath7 is some suitable tachyon potential .",
    "a homogeneous tachyon field @xmath8 in a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe with metric @xmath9 ~ ,   \\label{flrw}\\]]can be thought of as an ideal ( isotropic ) comoving perfect fluid with energy density @xmath3 given by @xmath10and pressure @xmath4 given by @xmath11where a dot denotes the derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath12 .",
    "the friedmann equation is then @xmath13while the equation of motion for the tachyon field @xmath14 reads @xmath15where @xmath16 here we consider the following potential @xcite @xmath17 } \\sqrt{1-(1+k)\\cos ^{2}\\left [ \\frac{3}{2}{\\sqrt{\\lambda \\,(1+k)}\\,t}% \\right ] } \\ ,   \\label{vtfixed}\\]]where @xmath2 and @xmath0 are free model parameters .",
    "> from the present values @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the phase space variables @xmath14 and of its time derivative @xmath20",
    "we found convenient in * ii * to introduce the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( denoted @xmath23 in * ii * ) defined as @xmath24 ~,\\]]@xmath25    the hubble parameter @xmath26 as a function of the redshift @xmath27 is expressed as @xmath28with @xmath29 , which can be computed in principle as follows @xmath30 ~,\\]]where @xmath31 can be obtained from ( [ rho ] ) and ( [ p ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we consider here a model containing only the tachyon field @xmath14 .",
    "hence , with respect to the expansion rate , the eos parameter @xmath1 of @xmath14 should be compared to what is usually called @xmath32 , for a universe filled with a dark energy component and dust - like matter . in particular , for @xmath0cdm we have @xmath33 .",
    "finally it is instructive to write down the second friedmann equation @xmath34 the big brake corresponds to vanishing energy density @xmath35 and infinite ( positive ) pressure @xmath4 .",
    "hence @xmath36 from ( [ f1 ] ) while @xmath37 from ( [ f2 ] ) at the big brake ( whence the name ) .",
    "it is reached for finite time and finite value of the scale factor .",
    "we consider the evolution of the trajectories of the model compatible with the supernovae data @xcite at the 1-@xmath38 level . to this purpose",
    "we first display on fig [ fig1 ] the behavior of the distance modulus and of the luminosity distance as functions of redshift @xmath27 , for 4 different models , all of them fitting within 1-@xmath38 accuracy the data ( actually , the curves have the best fits in their respective model classes ) .",
    "we recall that the distance modulus @xmath39 is defined as @xmath40where @xmath41 is the luminosity distance which , for a flat friedmann universe , is given by ( @xmath42 ) @xmath43    0.5 cm ) of the luminosity distance ( right panel ) in recent cosmological times .",
    "the models shown here are @xmath0cdm ( black ) ; the tachyonic model with @xmath44  evolving into de sitter ( ds , blue ) ; tachyonic models with @xmath45 evolving into de sitter ( green ) and into a big brake ( bb , red ) .  the curves are all in very good agreement with the snia data , as they pass close to the local minimum of the ( respective regions of the ) 1-@xmath46 domains selected by supernovae ( see figs 2 and 3 of * ii*.),title=\"fig:\",height=302 ] ) of the luminosity distance ( right panel ) in recent cosmological times",

    "all three curves pass close to the local minimum of the respective 1-@xmath38 domains selected by type ia supernovae .",
    "they are characterized by the model parameter @xmath44 ( blue ) and @xmath45 , respectively . for the latter we have picked up both types of allowed evolutions , one going into de sitter ( green ) , the other ending in a big brake ( red ) .",

    "these values are similar to @xmath0cdm where @xmath58 .",
    "as expected from viable cosmological evolutions , the parameter @xmath1 approaches zero in the past , corresponding to dust - like behavior at early times . for all parameters ,",
    "the pressure remains very slightly negative for the whole positive @xmath27 range plotted , thus @xmath1 stays below zero ( although it gets very close to it ) . under the assumption that this behavior is unchanged when dust is added , we expect to have a model where dark energy ( here the tachyon field ) remains nonnegligible in the early stages of the universe , with @xmath59 remaining roughly constant ( actually slightly increasing ) during the matter era before it would start dominating at late times .",
    "a similar behavior can also be achieved in some scalar - tensor de models , see e.g. @xcite .      though the big brake is a singularity taking place in the future , it is interesting to investigate whether models leading to a big brake exhibit some signature in our _ present - day _ universe .",
    "as one can see from fig [ fig4 ] , this is indeed the case for some of the universes with a big brake in the future which have a characteristic behavior of the eos parameter @xmath1 in our past : a dip  at low redshifts .",
    "this happens when the big brake is not too far in the future , in other words when the final redshift is substantially larger than @xmath60 .",
    "it is then interesting to investigate whether such a behavior can be detected .",
    "actually large variations of @xmath1 at low redshifts can easily hide in luminosity - distance curves .",
    "therefore , we expect that it is very difficult to observe this peculiar behavior with _ present _ snia data .",
    "let us consider why this is the case in more details .",
    "in our model we have only one component , the tachyon field , so what we call here @xmath1 is actually what should be called @xmath61 when more fluids are present .",
    "however , it would be easy to extend our analysis to the case when a dust - like component is also present .",
    "the eos parameter @xmath1 has a minimum at some small redshift @xmath62 with @xmath63 in the most favorable cases . in principle",
    "this can be tested and it is straightforward to derive the following equality @xmath64 as well as the inequalities @xmath65 where the quantity @xmath66 is easily expressed in terms of the luminosity - distance , viz .",
    "@xmath67 ~,\\ ] ] a prime standing for the derivative with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "hence it is seen that the ( in)equalities ( [ wmin]),([dw1]),([dw2 ] ) imply a condition on the third derivative of the luminosity distance @xmath68 !",
    "it is clear that even small uncertainties on @xmath41 can lead to large uncertainties on its derivatives thereby rendering the ( in)equalities ( [ wmin]),([dw1]),([dw2 ] ) ineffective .",
    "in addition , as we have to apply these conditions on low redshifts , these involve third order contributions in @xmath27 to @xmath41 which are inevitably small",
    ". obviously , observational uncertainties are presently too high in order to make use of ( [ wmin]),([dw1]),([dw2 ] ) with existing snia data .",
    "in the recent past and in the future for model parameters leading to a big brake and in the 1-@xmath46 domain of supernova data .",
    "all evolutions have a dip ( when , as @xmath27 decreases , the decrease in @xmath1  turns into an increase ) , some of them already in the recent past.,title=\"fig:\",height=302 ] 0.5 cm    still , we have tried to see whether a standard @xmath69 analysis making use only of snia data in the range @xmath70 could differentiate models with and without dip . this means that we assume a priori that the model with the dip at @xmath62 is the correct one and that we investigate whether a simple statistical analysis of this relevant part of the data could hint at its presence .",
    "as could be expected , even in this case we find no statistical evidence for the detection of a dip with the present snia data .",
    "note that even the constitution dataset @xcite contains only 147 sn data at redshifts @xmath71 .",
    "though more refined statistical tools should clearly be used ( see e.g. @xcite ) , it is quite obvious that the present data do not allow for an unambiguous detection .",
    "note that in some models a characteristic smoother variation of w can take place on a larger range of redshifts ( see e.g. @xcite ) which should be easier to detect .",
    "models involving a very large variation of @xmath1 at extremely low redshifts @xmath72 were considered in @xcite and it was found that they could escape all high precision measurements . in our case , variations , though not as large , are located at higher redshifts .",
    "we conjecture that future snia surveys , like e.g. the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) and wide field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) containing many more supernovae and reducing significantly the systematic and statistical errors could allow for such a detection .",
    "future surveys like euclid involving weak - lensing are also promising in this respect .",
    "we believe this could be an interesting scientific goal for these surveys especially if peculiar models with a large variation of their eos parameter at low , but not too low , redshifts , like some of our big brake models with a dip , are in good agreement with observations and are theoretically motivated candidates .",
    "the 3-spaces with @xmath73const have vanishing riemann curvature @xmath74the 4-dimensional riemann curvature tensor has therefore but few nonvanishing independent components:@xmath75and the corresponding components arising from symmetry .",
    "remarkably , all components which diverge at the big brake are of the type @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , the singularity arises in the mixed spatio - temporal components .",
    "the geodesic deviation equation along the integral curves of @xmath77 ( which are geodesics with affine parameter @xmath12 ) is@xmath78where @xmath79 is the deviation vector separating neighboring geodesics , chosen to satisfy @xmath80 . in the coordinate system ( [ flrw ] ) we obtain @xmath81which at the big brake diverges as @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , when approaching the big brake , the tidal forces manifest themselves as an infinite braking force stopping the further increase of the separation of geodesics .",
    "this can be also seen from the behavior of the velocity @xmath83which at the big brake vanishes .",
    "immediately after , the negative acceleration will cause the geodesics to approach each other .",
    "therefore a contraction phase will follow : everything that has reached the big brake will bounce back .",
    "we conclude the section with the remark that despite the singularity of the geometry ( the second derivative @xmath84 of the scale factor diverges at @xmath85 ) , its soft character ( @xmath86 stays regular ) assures that a continuation of the evolution is still possible in the following sense . we indeed need to know @xmath84 to follow the evolution of the spacetime but we only need to know @xmath86 to follow the evolution of free particles .",
    "this means that despite not being able to continue the evolution of the geometry in a direct way , we can univocally continue the individual world lines of freely falling test particles ( geodesics ) , each of these being perfectly regular at @xmath87 .",
    "the singularity is not experienced by any individual freely falling particle , but makes itself felt only through the equation of geodesic deviation , which at @xmath87 indicates that the expansion of the geodesic congruence turns negative from positive .",
    "once the particles have gone through the big brake , we can again start to evolve the geometry itself , thus following the further evolution of the universe beyond the singularity .",
    "as will be shown in the following section , the tachyonic universe will evolve along similar trajectories to those starting from a big bang , but in the opposite direction ( with @xmath88),@xmath89  arriving therefore into a big crunch .",
    "to understand how the crossing of the big brake singularity takes place , and what is going on after the crossing , it is convenient to refer to the phase portrait of the model at some positive value of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "this portrait was drawn in paper * i * and we reproduce it here , see fig .",
    "( @xmath90),height=264 ]    the accessible phase space of the model consists of a rectangle @xmath91 and four stripes .",
    "the values @xmath92 are those for which the potential ( [ vtfixed ] ) vanishes . inside the rectangle the dynamics of the system is described by the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) with the potential ( [ vtfixed ] ) , while in the strips the lagrangian is given by @xmath93 with the potential @xmath94 } \\sqrt{(1+k)\\cos ^{2}\\left [ \\frac{3}{2}{\\sqrt{\\lambda \\,(1+k)}\\,t}% \\right]-1 } \\ .",

    "the analysis of the equations of motion , carried out in paper * i * , has shown that the universe encounters a big brake ( bb ) singularity after a finite time .",
    "this singularity is characterized by some value of the tachyon field @xmath96 , of the time @xmath97 and of the value of the cosmological radius @xmath98 .",
    "these values are found numerically up to normalization , as was done in * ii*.    the equation of motion ( [ kg ] ) for the expanding universe in the left lower strip can be written as @xmath99 > from the analysis of this equation we find that , approaching the big brake singularity in the lower left strip of the phase diagram , the tachyon field @xmath100 , its time derivative @xmath101 , the cosmological radius @xmath102 , its time derivative @xmath86 and the hubble variable @xmath26 behave respectively as @xmath103 @xmath104@xmath105@xmath106@xmath107to arrive to formulae ( [ tachbb])([hubblebb ] ) we have used the following strategy .",
    "assume that in the neighborhood of the big brake singularity the tachyon field behaves as @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are some real parameters to be determined .",
    "then , @xmath101 behaves as @xmath111 while its time derivative is @xmath112 a simple calculation shows that the first `` friction '' term , proportional to the hubble variable in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ sdot0 ] ) , has the behavior @xmath113 which is stronger than the corresponding behavior of the second potential term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ sdot0 ] ) which is @xmath114 this means that the term @xmath115 in the left - hind side of eq .",
    "( [ sdot0 ] ) should have the same asymptotic as the friction term in the right - hand side of the same equation and , hence @xmath116 which gives immediately @xmath117 comparing the coefficients of the leading terms in eq .",
    "( [ sdot0 ] ) we find that @xmath118 thus , we arrive at eq .",
    "( [ tachbb ] ) .",
    "( [ sbb ] ) follows right away . using the friedmann equation we obtain the value of the hubble parameter ( eq .",
    "( [ hubblebb ] ) ) , which , in turn , gives formulae ( [ cosmradbb ] ) and ( [ cosmradderbb ] ) for the cosmological radius and for its time derivative .    the expressions ( [ tachbb])([hubblebb ] ) can be continued in the region where @xmath119 , which amounts to crossing the big brake singularity . only the expression for @xmath101 is singular at @xmath87 , but this singularity is integrable and not dangerous .    upon reaching the big brake ,",
    "it is impossible for the system to stop there because the infinite deceleration eventually leads to the decrease of the scale factor .",
    "this is because after the big brake crossing the time derivative of the cosmological radius ( [ cosmradderbb ] ) and of the hubble variable ( [ hubblebb ] ) change their signs .",
    "the expansion is then followed by a contraction .    corresponding to given initial conditions , we can find numerically the values of @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( see paper * ii * ) .",
    "then , in order to see what happens after the big brake crossing , we can choose as initial conditions for the after - big - brake - contraction phase  some value @xmath120 and the corresponding expressions for @xmath121 and @xmath86 following from relations ( [ tachbb])([hubblebb ] ) , and integrate numerically the equations of motion , thus arriving eventually to a big crunch singularity .",
    "after the big brake crossing the universe has a negative value of the variable @xmath101 , less than @xmath60 .",
    "this means that its evolution should end in a finite period of time .",
    "remember that the universe is now squeezing .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath101 then looks as follows : @xmath122    in principle , the evolution of the universe can either end at the vertical line @xmath123 at some value of @xmath101 or at the horizontal line @xmath124 at some value of @xmath14",
    ". one can find the corresponding points on the phase diagram by direct analysis of the system of equations of motion .",
    "however , such an analysis is rather cumbersome .",
    "thus it is convenient to use some results of the analysis of the trajectories for the expanding universe given in paper * i*. begin by writing down the equation for the trajectories describing the _ expanding _ universe in the phase space ( @xmath125 ) , eliminating the time parameter @xmath12 : @xmath126 this equation is valid in both the rectangle of the phase diagram and in the strips . in * i * we have considered it in the upper left strip and saw there that the trajectories of the phase diagram can have their beginning only in the points @xmath127 , @xmath128 or @xmath129 .",
    "now , it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( kg ) that the simultaneous change of sign of the hubble parameter @xmath130 and of the time derivative of the tachyon field leaves this equation invariant .",
    "this means that the trajectories describing the expansion from the big bang singularity in the upper left strip are symmetrical reflections with respect to the axis @xmath131 of the trajectories describing the contraction towards the big crunch singularity in the lower left strip .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq - trajec ] ) written above describes also the trajectories of the contracting universe in the lower left strip . in turn",
    ", this implies that all the contracting trajectories can only end at the points @xmath132 , @xmath133 or @xmath134 .",
    "we are now in a position to analyze the behavior of all these trajectories , describing the contracting universe , using the results obtained for the corresponding trajectories , born in the left upper strip , describing the expanding universe .",
    "first , all the contracting trajectories encountering the big crunch singularity at the point @xmath135 , where @xmath136 and the unique trajectory ending in the point @xmath137 enter the lower left strip from the rectangle of the phase diagram through the corner @xmath138 without arriving from the big brake singularity ( indeed , they originate from the repelling de sitter node ) .",
    "these trajectories are the time - reversed of the corresponding expanding trajectories , having their origin at the points @xmath139 and of the unique trajectory originating at the point @xmath140 , which enter into the rectangle through the point p ( see fig .",
    "5 ) and which do not undergo any change of the expansion regime .",
    "thus , the only point where the trajectories coming from the crossing of the big brake singularity can end to is @xmath141 .",

    "now , analyzing eq .",
    "( [ sdot0 ] ) for this trajectory , we find that in the left neighborhood of @xmath87 the dynamical variables behave as follows : @xmath167@xmath168@xmath169where @xmath170the analysis leading to these formulae is analogous to the one which led us to formulae ( [ tachbb])([hubblebb ] ) .",
    "if we continue ( [ sep])([sep3 ] ) beyond @xmath87 we see that the expansion turns into a contraction , the tachyon field @xmath14 starting to decrease , while its time derivative jumps at @xmath87 from an infinite positive value to an infinite negative one .",
    "thus , at @xmath119 the universe finds itself in the lower left strip .",
    "it leaves the big brake along the asymptotic line @xmath171 , and eventually attains the big crunch singularity at the point @xmath132 . in",
    "the lower left strip the separatrix separates the trajectories exiting from the big brake singularity at some value @xmath172 from those which enter the strip from the rectangle , attain a minimum value of @xmath101 and end in the big crunch .    in summary , the expansion phase of the universe , which originated from a big bang , stops at @xmath87 and turns there into a phase of contraction leading eventually to a big crunch .",
    "we give here the tables [ table1]-[table3 ] which , for a selection of values of the model parameter @xmath2 , report the times elapsing from today to the tachyonic crossing , to the attainment of the big brake and to the later attainment of the big crunch for some trajectories which are compatible with snia data within a 1-@xmath38 confidence level .",
    "as we can see , although the time to the tachyonic crossing and to the big brake both depend strongly on the initial data within the 1-@xmath38 domain selected by supernovae , the time interval between the big brake and the big crunch do _ not _ show the same dependence .",
    "nevertheless , this interval exhibits a slight increase with the model parameter @xmath173",
    "as shown in * ii * there are tachyon cosmologies described by eqs.(l)-([f2 ] ) which are compatible with the supernovae data and which are subject to a big brake in the future . in this paper",
    "we have addressed some questions about this model : how it behaves in the distant past , whether these model universes can produce observational signatures today and whether they can be continued beyond the big brake singularity .",
    "having in mind the eventual construction of fully viable models , we are comforted by the fact that the tachyonic field has a ( quasi ) dust - like behavior in the past regardless of its future evolution in the parameter range allowed by supernovae .",
    "present supernovae data can hardly discriminate between the evolutions going into a de sitter phase and those leading to a big brake .",
    "however , we emphasize that the large variation of the eos parameter at low redshifts occurring in some of the evolutions leading to a big brake might be detectable with future high precision data .",
    "the main result of the paper is the study of the cosmological evolutions going into a big brake .",
    "these evolutions can be extended beyond the big brake , despite the geometry becoming singular , which apparently forbids such a continuation . however , this singularity is a soft one , as only the second derivative @xmath84 of the scale factor diverges at @xmath87 , while @xmath174 does not .",
    "we need to know @xmath84 to follow the evolution of the spacetime but we only need to know @xmath86 to follow the evolution of free particles .",
    "this means that we can not continue the evolution of the geometry , but we can univocally continue the individual world lines of freely falling test particles ( geodesics ) , each of these being perfectly regular at @xmath87 .",
    "the singularity is not experienced by any individual freely falling particle , but makes itself felt only through the equation of geodesic deviation , which at @xmath87 indicates that the expansion of the geodesic congruence turns negative from positive .",
    "since the geometry can be reconstructed by the knowledge of each of its geodesics , the evolution of the universe does not stop at the big brake .",
    "once the particles have gone through the big brake , they will determine the geometry anew and we can start to evolve the universe beyond the singularity .",
    "a phase of contraction follows , leading eventually to a big crunch .",
    "we have analytically and numerically analyzed the evolution of the tachyonic universe from the big brake to the big crunch .",
    "quite remarkably , the numerical study showed that although the time to the tachyonic crossing and to the big brake both depend strongly on the initial data chosen from the 1-@xmath175 domain selected by supernovae , the time intervals between the big brake and the big crunch do _ not _ exhibit the same dependence  and they only slightly depend on the model parameter @xmath2 ( within a factor of two ) .",
    "this seems to provide an _ invariant timescale _ for the class of tachyonic scalar cosmologies considered , presumably related to the fact that some information ( the behavior of the higher derivatives of the scale factor ) is lost while passing through the big brake .",
