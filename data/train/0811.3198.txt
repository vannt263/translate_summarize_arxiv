    "their dynamical mass - to - light ratios , derived by fitting dynamical models to their stellar velocity dispersion profiles or based on stability arguments , vary from a few tens up to a few hundreds , in solar units @xcite .",
    "this high mass - to - light ratio suggests the presence of copious amounts of dark matter that help protect the embedded stellar body of the dsph against the tidal forces of the massive host galaxy or of the galaxy cluster or group in which the dsph resides .",
    "this would explain why only a handful of dsphs in the local group show clear signs of an ongoing interaction despite being close satellites of either the milky way or m31 @xcite .",

    "bright elliptical galaxies , or es , and des follow the same photometric and kinematic scaling relations @xcite . in the luminosity interval",
    "@xmath6  mag the parameters of the srsic profile follow simple power - laws as a function of luminosity and early and late type galaxies trace parallel tully - fisher relations @xcite . from this wealth of data a picture of ( dwarf ) galaxy formation emerges that suggests an underlying unity in the physics driving the formation and evolution of stellar systems , with the environment playing a role that is in many situations subordinate to that of internal processes .",
    "more specifically , numerical simulations and semi - analytic models of galaxy formation within a @xmath7cdm cosmology can account for the observed scaling relations when taking into account supernova feedback in galactic gravitational potential wells steepening with galaxy mass @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate whether the photometric scaling relations traced by des and es persist down to the dsphs ( @xmath8  mag ) .",
    "we also check for possible environmental influences , other than the obvious density - morphology relation ( i.e. the fact that des / dsphs are found predominantly in high - density environments ) .",

    "all other datasets rather suggest that half - light radius behaves as a power - law as a function of luminosity in the regime m@xmath58  mag .",
    "a fit to the data of the dwarf galaxies fainter than m@xmath59  mag from the d05 , antlia , perseus and local group datasets gives @xmath60 ( orange line in panel * ( a ) * of fig .",
    "[ lvvi ] ) .",
    "the gentle curvature of the m@xmath61r@xmath23 relation around m@xmath52  mag was shown by @xcite to be a consequence of the power - law dependence of the srsic parameters on galaxy luminosity .",
    "one small caveat , however :  the half - light radius can be measured in a number of different ways which do not necessarily yield the same result for a given galaxy .",
    "one can , for instance , use the geometric mean of the semi - major axis and semi - minor axis of the elliptical isophote that encloses half the light as a measure for r@xmath23 . or",
    "one can fit a srsic law to the surface brightness profile , evaluated as a function of equivalent radius , and adopt the half - light radius of this model profile , as in @xcite . or one can construct the growth curve model - independently by integrating the observed surface brightness over circular apertures and thus derive a half - light radius , as in @xcite . for spherically symmetric galaxies , these different approaches obviously yield the same result .",
    "for very flattened galaxies , they may differ .",
    "if the early - type galaxy population shows a trend of mean flattening with luminosity ( see e.g. @xcite ) , this might introduce a spurious trend of half - light radius with luminosity .    in order to check how large this systematic effect can be ,",
    "we create synthetic galaxy images using flattened srsic profiles with different flattenings @xmath62 and srsic exponents @xmath1 .",
    "the half - light radius is then measured as the geometric mean of the semi - major axis and semi - minor axis of the elliptical isophote that encloses half the light and by integrating over circular isophotes .",
    "the difference between the two approaches is plotted in fig . [ fitre ] as a function of flattening @xmath63 and srsic @xmath1 .",
    "the maximum deviation is obtained for small @xmath1 and strong flattening and is not larger than @xmath64 .",
    "this is smaller than the scatter on the observed scaling relations .",
    "we therefore do not expect to see any significant systematic trend of half - light radius with flattening as a result of the particular way it was measured .    although the data show considerable scatter , especially in the dwarf regime ,",
    "it is striking that galaxies from a wide range of environments trace a continuous m@xmath48 vs. r@xmath23 relation over a range of 6 orders of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "it is well known that early - type galaxies brighter than m@xmath65  mag trace a single m@xmath48 vs. @xmath1 relation .",
    "this relation is quantified as @xmath66 by @xcite , as @xmath67 by @xcite , and as @xmath68 by @xcite .",
    "these authors fit srsic profiles to the observed surface brightness profiles , evaluated as function of equivalent radius .",
    "however , it is also possible to fit the growth curve , constructed by integrating a galaxy image over circular apertures , with the growth curve of the srsic profile .",
    "this approach is advocated by @xcite .",
    "the latter method of determining the srsic exponent @xmath1 assigns a large weight to the outer data points and has the obvious advantage of yielding a srsic model with the same total luminosity as the observed galaxy .",
    "however , the model s surface brightness profile does not necessarily provide an acceptable fit to that of the observed galaxy .",
    "the former method , on the other hand , assigns a large weight to the inner data points .",
    "this method has the benefits that clearly non - srsic components ( such as a nuclear star cluster of a stellar halo ) can be omitted from the fit and that the model provides a good fit to the observed surface brightness profile ( at least within some specified radial range ) .",
    "it does not , however , necessarily provide a good approximation of the galaxy s growth curve .    as an example",
    ", we apply both methods to the sculptor dsph , with star count data taken @xcite , and to our new hst / acs photometry of cgw45 , a perseus cluster de , taken from the sample of @xcite .",
    "the observed surface brightness profile of cgw45 , @xmath69 , is converted into a `` star counts '' profile in arbitrary units , @xmath70 using @xmath71 sculptor is an example of a galaxy whose surface brightness profile deviates from a srsic law at large radii ; cgw45 , a nucleated de , on the other hand , deviates from a srsic profile at small radii .",
    "the differences between the two methods for obtaining @xmath1 are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ser1 ] . a fit to",
    "the stellar density profile of sculptor yields @xmath72 ; a fit to the growth curve results in @xmath73 .",
    "the former method yields a very good approximation to both the growth curve and the density profile within the inner 30  arcmin but fails at larger radii .",
    "the latter method gives a superior fit to the growth curve outside 30  arcmin but fails to provide an acceptable fit to the density profile . in the case of cgw45 ,",
    "both methods give @xmath74 .",
    "the central nucleus prevents both methods from yielding a good fit to the growth curve within the inner 0.2@xmath15 . omitting the central 0.2@xmath15 results in a very good srsic fit to the density profile .",
    "choosing between these two methods is clearly a matter of taste . here , as in @xcite , we wish @xmath1 to reflect the shape of the surface brightness profile of the bulk of the galaxy and , therefore , opt to fit a srsic profile to the surface brightness profile evaluated as a function of equivalent radius .",
    "it is obvious from panel * ( b ) * of fig .",
    "[ lvvi ] that for galaxies fainter than m@xmath19  mag the relation between luminosity and @xmath1 appears to break down .",
    "the dwarf spheroidals for which the srsic exponent @xmath1 is available , i.e. the local group dsphs , for some of which we have measured @xmath1 using published star counts @xcite , and our new perseus cluster dsphs , all lie in the range @xmath75 to 1.0 , essentially independent of galaxy luminosity .",
    "this @xmath1 is significantly larger than that predicted by the scaling relations mentioned before ( green curve ) .",
    "it is , therefore , clear that in the dsph regime , the power - law behaviour of the m@xmath76 relation breaks down .    from fig .",
    "[ ser ] , it is clear that a srsic profile with @xmath77 is almost indistinguishable from a king model with a concentration @xmath78 in the range 3 to 10 , which is typical for dsphs . in this figure",
    ", we plot the radial profile of projected stellar density of the sculptor dsph ( black data points ) , taken from @xcite , overplotted with the best fitting srsic profile ( red line ) and king profile ( green line ) .",
    "the srsic profile has a shape parameter @xmath79 ; the concentration of the king profile is @xmath80 .",
    "both 3-parameter laws give a very good representation of the data , taking into account a background density of 1.13  arcmin@xmath2 .",
    "thus , the breakdown of the power - law dependence of @xmath1 on luminosity in the dsph regime might have been foreseen based on the already known fact that @xmath81 for dsphs .",
    "@xcite fit the surface brightness profiles of a sample of local volume dsphs , dirrs , and brighter late - type galaxies with exponentials and investigate the resulting relation between luminosity and exponential scale - length , denoted by @xmath82 .",
    "they note that the luminosity-@xmath82 relation becomes almost flat in the dsph regime .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the m@xmath83 and m@xmath84 relations presented here .",
    "we generate synthetic srsic surface brightness profiles using the latter relations .",
    "we fit these synthetic surface brightness profiles with exponentials and thus constructed a m@xmath85 relation .",
    "this relation is in excellent agreement with the one found observationally by @xcite . between m@xmath86  mag and m@xmath87  mag , the exponential scale - length increases only from 0.25  kpc to 0.5  kpc .",
    "this m@xmath85 relation is much shallower than the m@xmath83 relation because of the increase of @xmath1 with m@xmath48 , which makes brighter galaxies more centrally concentrated than fainter ones .",
    "the m@xmath88 diagram is presented in panel * ( c ) * of fig .",
    "the vertical black line marks the @xmath89 background noise level of our hst / acs images , translated into a v - band surface brightness .",
    "we can only derive reliable surface photometry for galaxies with a central surface brightness above roughly this background limit , corresponding to @xmath90  mag  arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "for galaxies brighter than m@xmath65  mag , the central surface brightness , estimated by extrapolating the best fitting srsic profile to zero radius , varies as a power of the luminosity .",
    "only the very brightest cored ges deviate from this power law .",
    "this underlying unity between es and des was not initially appreciated since it is not reflected in the luminosity vs. mean and effective surface brightness diagrams @xcite . using the srsic parameters as fundamental morphological parameters , the assumed structural dichotomy between es and des has disappeared and the idea that similar physical processes have governed the evolution of _ all _ spheroidal galaxies was put forward .",
    "however , for galaxies fainter than m@xmath19  mag , the slope of the @xmath91 relation changes significantly .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the near constancy of @xmath1 in this luminosity regime , with @xmath92 ( panel * ( b ) * of fig .",

    "the latter translates into a m@xmath93 relation , with r@xmath94 the scale - radius of the srsic profile , that is completely similar to the m@xmath83 relation . given @xmath95 and this m@xmath96 relation ,",

    "it is important to note that the slope change around m@xmath87  mag is immediately evident from the data sets for the dwarf populations of the fornax cluster and the perseus cluster , which cover the transition region in the m@xmath100 diagram .",
    "hence , within the same environment , dsphs ( m@xmath4  mag ) and des / es ( m@xmath101  mag ) follow a m@xmath100 relation with a slope that varies as a function of luminosity .",
    "early - type galaxies from different environments ( the local group , fornax , coma , perseus ,  ) all fall on the same m@xmath100 relation .",
    "this shows that the slope of this relation is a strong function of galaxy luminosity but not of environment .    as @xcite note ,",
    "their sample includes a population of dsphs that have much fainter central surface brightnesses than those of the local group .",
    "our hst / acs imaging , unfortunately , does not go deep enough to detect such a population in the perseus cluster . in order to quantify the effect of this population on the global scaling relation , we measure the surface brightness deviation of the fornax dsphs and of the local group and perseus cluster dsphs from the straight - line relation given by eq .",

    "this is the signature of the low - surface brightness population .",
    "this population is clearly absent from the local group and perseus dsph datasets .",

    "central surface brightness increases with luminosity until the formation of the very brightest , cored ellipticals . * the cores in the most luminous ellipticals",
    "are thought to result from the partial evacuation of the nuclear region by coalescing black holes ( see gg03 and references therein ) .",
    "* at m@xmath114  mag , the slope of the m@xmath100 changes abruptly .",
    "we have shown that the m@xmath48 vs. v@xmath24i is essentially a metallicity - luminosity relation of old stellar populations , keeping the same slope over the whole luminosity range investigated here .",
    "clearly , the absolute magnitude m@xmath114  mag is not just an arbitrary divide between dsphs and des .",
    "the rather abrupt changes in the slopes of some of the photometric scaling relations suggest that below and above this luminosity , different physical processes dominate the evolution of early type galaxies .",
    "the near - independence of these scaling relations with respect to environment and the physical differences between dsphs and des will be investigated theoretically using n - body / sph - models in another paper in this series ( de rijcke , valcke , conselice , penny , held , in prep . ) . in a sense ,",
    "the divide between des and es , which has historically been placed at m@xmath117  mag seems more arbitrary since the behaviour of the basic parameters describing the shapes of the surface brightness profiles as a function of luminosity ( i.e. the srsic parameters ) does not change .",
    "a comparison of numerical simulations with observed scaling relations suggests that the luminosity dependence of the srsic parameters is due to fact that the effects of supernova feedback become more important as galactic gravitational potential wells become more shallow for lower galaxy masses @xcite .",
    "this causes des to be more diffuse and to have stars orbiting with lower velocities than predicted by the extrapolated relations for es @xcite .    *",
    "these scaling relations are amazingly insensitive to ( local ) environment . in fig .",
    "[ pointings1 ] , we show the central surface brightness , @xmath38 ( left panel ) , and half - light radius , r@xmath118 ( right panel ) , as a function of projected distance ( in kpc ) , @xmath119 , to the nearest bright galaxy ( with m@xmath120  mag ) .",
    "the triangle data points are the perseus dsphs . in the left panel ,",
    "the necessary data are available for the dsphs / des of the local group , the perseus dsphs , and the fornax cluster dsphs / des from d05 and mieske et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . in the right panel",
    ", we use data from the dsphs / des of the local group , the perseus dsphs , the fornax cluster des from d05 , and the antlia dspsh / des from smith castelli et al .",
    "the data points are color coded according to their absolute luminosity , from blue ( m@xmath121  mag ) over red ( m@xmath87  mag ) to green ( m@xmath122  mag ) . while there is no statistically significant correlation between these structural parameters and distance to the nearest bright galaxy",
    "there is a strong correlation with luminosity . *",
    "we have also plotted these quantities as a function of distance to the cluster or group center divided by the virial radius r@xmath123 .",
    "again , no correlation with position becomes apparent .",
    "the galaxies with central surface brightness @xmath124  mag  arcsec@xmath2 , where the slope of the m@xmath125 relation changes , have nearest neighbor distances scattering between 20 and 300  kpc .",
    "however , they all have luminosities m@xmath114  mag . from this exercise",
    ", we can conclude that the photometric scaling relations presented in fig .",
    "[ lvvi ] are not a consequence of environmental segregation , with fainter galaxies preferentially located close to a bright galaxy .    @xcite study the structural parameters such as the concentration index , petrosian radius , velocity dispersion , u@xmath24r colour ,  of a volume - limited sample of 49,571 galaxies extracted from the sdss .",
    "they show that these parameters are almost independent of large - scale density and neighbor separation unless the latter is smaller than about one - tenth of the bright neighbor s virial radius , i.e. , of the order of a few tens of kpc ( their figs . 7 and 9 ) .",
    "all galaxies presented in the present paper have projected distances between 0.1 and 1 virial radii away from their nearest bright neighbor and , as @xcite , we observe no significant relation between nearest - neighbor distance or environment density and structural properties in this regime .",
    "this also corroborates the results of @xcite who study a sample of galaxies selected from the sdss dr4 and find that the structural properties of early - type satellite galaxies are very similar to early - type central galaxies .",
    "hence , the structure of early - type galaxies is not significantly affected by environmental effects .",
    "the most obvious environmental effect appears to be the population of low surface brightness dsphs discovered by @xcite in the fornax cluster .",
    "where an environmental influence is clearly discernible , it has only mild effects on the scaling relations .",
    "the presence of a low - surface brightness population of fornax dsphs does nt affect the global scaling relation appreciably . at a given luminosity ,",
    "the fornax dsph population is on average 0.2  mag  arcsec@xmath2 fainter than the perseus and local group dsph populations .",
    "the m31 companions with tidal extensions or distorsions @xcite are not displaced from the general scaling relations .",
    "this may indicate that dsphs intrinsically have high enough m / l to survive unscathed ( see @xcite ) or that dsphs with too low",
    "m / l have been destroyed and only those with high",
    "m / l survive to the present day .",
