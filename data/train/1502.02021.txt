    "with the rapid progress made in upgrading and testing a series of advanced interferometric gravitational - wave detectors such as ligo  @xcite , virgo  @xcite , and kagra  @xcite , there are now great expectations that in the next five years we will witness the first direct detection of gravitational waves .",
    "prime sources for such a detection are binary systems of compact objects , namely , binary systems comprising either two black holes , a black hole and a neutron star , or two neutron stars . the latter configuration , in particular , is potentially a very interesting one , as it will represent the most common source , with a realistic expected detection rate of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "a detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars would yield a wealth of information about the chirp mass , the orientation , and the localization of the binary but also possibly the mass , spin and radius of the individual stars  @xcite . in turn , this information could set constraints on the equation of state ( eos ) of the matter in their interior . indeed , a number of recent investigations have revealed that it is possible to set serious constraints on the properties of the neutron - star structure and eos , either when using the inspiral signal only @xcite , or when exploiting the rich spectral features of the postmerger signal @xcite .    at the same time",
    ", the merger of a binary system containing at least one neutron star represents arguably the most attractive scenario to explain the complex phenomenology associated with short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ) , although many alternatives exist [ see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ] . while such a scenario was suggested already 30 years ago  @xcite , numerical simulations ( see , e.g. ,  refs .",
    "@xcite ) and new observations  @xcite have put this scenario on firmer grounds . in particular",
    ", what these simulations have shown is that the merger of a binary system of neutron stars inevitably leads to the formation of a metastable object , which we dub the binary - merger product or bmp .",
    "depending on the total mass and mass ratio of the binary , the bmp can either be a supramassive neutron star ( smns ) , that is , a star with mass above the maximum mass for nonrotating configurations @xmath1 but below the maximum mass for uniformly rotating configurations @xmath2 , with @xmath3  @xcite ; a hypermassive neutron star ( hmns ) , that is , a star more massive than a smns ; or a black hole .",
    "since the mass distribution in neutron - star binaries is peaked around @xmath4 @xcite , this implies that @xmath5 .",
    "although this can not be excluded , there is also no observational evidence that such massive neutron stars exist . ] .",
    "the general - relativistic hydrodynamical modelling of binary neutron stars has seen very considerable progress over the last decade ( see , e.g. ,  refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and it has now reached a rather mature state .",
    "in fact , it is presently possible to calculate inspiral waveforms having a phase accuracy comparable to that of binary black - hole simulations thanks to the use of high - order methods with high - order convergence rates @xcite or of very high - resolution and long inspirals @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the space of parameters is also being carefully investigated , both in terms of the variety of the eoss considered  @xcite , and of the treatment of radiative losses via neutrino cooling  @xcite .",
    "when magnetic fields are present , on the other hand , the bulk of work carried out so far is considerably more limited .",
    "investigations of the impact that magnetic fields have on the dynamics of the binary have in fact started with the first short - inspiral works in refs .",
    "@xcite , which were complemented by the longer simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite . the latter work , together with ref .",
    "@xcite , also investigated the possibility that magnetic fields could have an impact on the gravitational - wave signals emitted by these systems during the inspiral .",
    "the conclusions reached were that , for realistic strengths @xmath6 , the presence of magnetic fields could not be revealed by detectors such as advanced ligo or advanced virgo .",
    "the astrophysical implications of the merger of a magnetized neutron - star binary were explored in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that instabilities in the torus orbiting the black hole amplify the magnetic field by 3 orders of magnitude and generate a magnetic - jet structure characterized by an ordered poloidal magnetic field along the black - hole spin axis . the broad consistency with the observations in terms of black - hole spin , torus mass and accretion rate , and magnetic - field topology offered the first evidence that the merger of magnetized neutron stars can provide the basic conditions for the central engine of sgrbs .",
    "considerable effort has also been dedicated to investigating the properties of the hmns under more controlled conditions .",
    "for instance , using ultrahigh spatial resolutions but axisymmetric initial data , ref .",
    "@xcite has provided the first evidence from three - dimensional global simulations that a magnetorotational instability ( mri )  @xcite is likely to develop during the lifetime of the hmns ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for earlier work in two dimensions ) .",
    "in addition , again using axisymmetric initial data and different magnetic field configurations , it has been shown that a magnetically driven wind can be launched from the outer layers of the hmns as a result of its differential rotation @xcite .",
    "these works have also highlighted that for realistic magnetic field topologies the wind is baryon loaded and quasi - isotropic , with bulk velocities of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "more recently , instead , the use of subgrid modeling as an effective way to describe the turbulent dynamics that develops in the shear layer between the two neutron stars at merger , has suggested that amplifications of up to 5 orders of magnitude are possible @xcite , although these amplifications are not produced in direct simulations @xcite , even at very high resolution @xcite .",
    "finally , progress has taken place also on the derivation of improved numerical techniques , such as those in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the significant advantages of a vector - potential approach and of a lorentz gauge were discussed .",
    "all of the works mentioned above have been carried out within the ideal - magnetohydrodynamic ( imhd ) approximation , in which the electrical conductivity is assumed to be infinite . under these conditions ,",
    "the magnetic flux is conserved and the magnetic field is frozen into the fluid , being simply advected with it .",
    "this is a very good approximation for the stellar interior before the merger because it neglects any effect of resistivity on the dynamics of the plasma .",
    "after the merger , however , there will be spatial regions with very hot plasma where the electrical conductivity is finite and the resistive effects , most notably , magnetic reconnection , will take place .    an obvious improvement over the imhd description is the use of the general - relativistic resistive - magnetohydrodynamic ( rmhd ) equations , which provide a complete magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) description of regions with a high conductivity , such as the stellar interiors , and of regions with small conductivity , such as the electrovacuum exterior .",
    "furthermore , when the conductivity is set to zero , it yields the maxwell equations in vacuum , thus allowing for the study of the magnetic - field evolution also well outside the stellar magnetosphere  @xcite .    partly because of the increased complexity of the equations and partly because of the additional difficulties posed by their numerical solution ( the equations easily become stiff in regions of high conductivity ) , rmhd simulations have started only rather recently .",
    "most of the work so far has focussed on problems in flat spacetimes @xcite , but general - relativistic investigations have also been carried out on fixed spacetimes @xcite .",
    "indeed , together with the work carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite , those reported here are , to the best of our knowledge , the only rmhd simulations of the dynamics of binary neutron stars in general relativity .",
    "more specifically , we have followed the inspiral , merger , and collapse to a black hole of a neutron - star binary in which the stars have the same gravitational mass of @xmath8 and are modelled with a simple ideal - fluid eos .    complementing the work reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , which concentrated on the electromagnetic emission during the inspiral and at the merger , the focus of the simulations reported here is that of assessing the impact that resistive effects have on the dynamics of the binary after the merger and through to collapse to a black hole . to this scope",
    "we have carried out a close comparison with an equivalent simulation performed for the same binary within the traditional imhd approximation . in this way it has been possible to determine both the similarities between the two regimes and the novel features .",
    "the most important of such features is the evidence the survival time of the hmns before collapse to a black hole increases in a rmhd simulation .",
    "this difference is associated to a less efficient magnetic braking in the resistive regime , in which matter is no longer perfectly advected with the flow , but can move across magnetic - field lines . in turn",
    ", this reduces the transport of angular momentum away from the central regions of the hmns , increasing its lifetime .",
    "interestingly , a longer - lived magnetized hmns is of help in those models of sgrbs which invoke the existence of a magnetarlike object produced after the merger @xcite .",
    "another important result of the simulations reported here , which have been performed at higher resolutions and with a different grid structure than those in the previous work of ref .",
    "@xcite , is the confirmation that a magnetic - jet structure is formed in the low - density funnel produced by the black hole ",
    "torus system .",
    "both in rmhd and in imhd , the magnetic field is predominantly toroidal in the highly conducting torus and predominantly poloidal in the nearly evacuated funnel .",
    "furthermore , because of the effective decoupling between the matter and the electromagnetic fields achieved in the rmhd simulations , the magnetic - jet structure is coherent on the largest scale of our system .",
    "however , as in the imhd case , also in these rmhd simulations , the magnetic - jet structure does not lead to an ultrarelativistic outflow .",
    "reconnection processes or neutrino annihilation occurring in the funnel could potentially increase the internal energy in the funnel and launch a relativistic outflow ; none of these effects is modeled in our simulations .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : binaries : approach ] we briefly review the mathematical setup of our simulations , concentrating mostly on the discussion of the general - relativistic rmhd equations used and on the expression of the generalized ohm s law we have employed . section [ sec : numsetup ] , on the other hand , is dedicated to illustrate the numerical strategy employed in the solution of the combined set of the einstein and rmhd equations , including the properties of our computational grid , of our matching to the low - density exterior , and of our initial data .",
    "the core of the paper is represented by sec .",
    "[ sec : binaries : results ] , where we present our results .",
    "after a brief overview , we discuss the magnetic - field topology and magnetic - jet structure produced in the simulations , as well as the comparison with the imhd case .",
    "such a comparison goes over a number of aspects , from the angular - momentum transfer and lifetime of the hmns , over to the black hole  torus system , and the electromagnetic luminosities .",
    "finally , sec . [",
    "sec : binaries : conclusions ] contains a conclusive summary of our results and the prospects for future research .",
    "although this is not the focus of this work , an illustration of the magnetic - jet structure obtained in the imhd simulations is presented in appendix [ sec : appendix : imhd ] for completeness .",
    "we use a spacelike signature @xmath9 and a system of units in which @xmath10 unless stated differently .",
    "much of the numerical setup used in these simulations has been presented in greater detail in other papers  @xcite , and for compactness we will review here only the basic aspects , referring the interested reader to the papers above for additional information .",
    "however , given its importance here , we will dedicate some space to a review of our fully general - relativistic rmhd framework , which was first presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and represents the extension of the special - relativistic rmhd formalism discussed in ref .",
    "a similar but independent extension has been presented recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , which describes the first 3 + 1 general - relativistic rmhd implementation in fixed spacetimes .",
    "we start by presenting the augmented maxwell equations @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the 4-metric , @xmath13 is the faraday tensor , @xmath14 is the maxwell tensor , @xmath15 is the electric four - current density , and @xmath16 are two auxiliary scalar variables added to the maxwell equations to control the constraints for the magnetic and electric parts , respectively ( see below ) .    after a standard 3 + 1 splitting of spacetime",
    ", the maxwell and faraday tensors can be decomposed in terms of the electric ( @xmath17 ) and magnetic ( @xmath18 ) fields measured by an observer moving along the normal direction @xmath19 ( i.e. ,  normal or eulerian observer ) as @xmath20 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 the determinant of the 4-metric and @xmath23 the levi - civit symbol .",
    "the same can be done for the electric four - current @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the charge density and the electric current density for an eulerian observer , respectively . using these definitions and performing a 3 + 1 decomposition of eqs .   and with respect to the normal vector @xmath27",
    ", we arrive at the following evolution equations , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the spatial 3-metric , @xmath30 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the lapse and @xmath33 is the shift 4-vector .",
    "we recall that @xmath34 denotes the lie derivative along the shift vector and that @xmath35 is related to the four - dimensional levi - civit tensor via @xmath36 or alternatively @xmath37 , where @xmath38 now is the determinant of the 3-metric .",
    "the scalar fields @xmath39 measure the deviation from the constrained solution , with @xmath40 driving the solution of eq .",
    "toward the zero - divergence condition @xmath41 , and @xmath42 driving the solution of eq .   toward the condition",
    "@xmath43 . this driving is exponentially fast and over a time scale @xmath44 .",
    "this approach , named hyperbolic divergence cleaning in the context of imhd , was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite as a simple way of solving the maxwell equations and enforcing the conservation of the divergence - free condition for the magnetic field .",
    "this method has been extended to the resistive relativistic case in refs .",
    ".    an obvious consequence of the maxwell equations in rmhd is the conservation law associated with the electric charge @xmath45 which provides an evolution equation for the charge density @xmath46 combining the mhd and maxwell equations we obtain the following set of evolution equations , which we write in a flux - conservative form as    @xmath47 = 0\\ , , \\end{split } \\label{charge_evol } \\\\ \\begin{split } \\partial_t ( \\sqrt{\\gamma } d ) + \\partial_k [ \\sqrt{\\gamma } ( -\\beta^k d   + \\alpha v^k d ) ] = 0\\ , , \\end{split } \\label{rest_mass_evol } \\\\ \\begin{split } \\partial_t ( \\sqrt{\\gamma } \\tau ) + \\partial_k \\{\\sqrt{\\gamma }   [ -\\beta^k \\tau + \\alpha ( s^k - v^k d)]\\ } =     \\sqrt{\\gamma } ( \\alpha   s^{lm } k_{lm } - s^k \\partial_k \\alpha)\\ , , \\end{split } \\label{energy_density_evol } \\\\ \\begin{split } \\partial_t ( \\sqrt{\\gamma } s_i ) + \\partial_k [ \\sqrt{\\gamma }    ( -\\beta^k s_i + \\alpha   s^k_{\\ i }   ) ] =      \\sqrt{\\gamma } \\left[\\frac{\\alpha}{2 }    s^{lm } \\partial_i \\gamma_{lm}+ s_k \\partial_i \\beta^k   - ( \\tau +    d ) \\partial_i \\alpha \\right]\\ , .   \\label{momentum_evol } \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ eq : rmhdconservative ]    the fluid variables @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are the conserved rest - mass density , the conserved energy density , the conserved momentum , and the fully spatial projection of the energy - momentum tensor , respectively .",
    "their explicit definitions are therefore @xmath51    here , @xmath52 is the lorentz factor , where @xmath53 are the components of the fluid 4-velocity and @xmath54 are the components of the 3-velocity as measured by the eulerian observer .",
    "furthermore , @xmath55 is the enthalpy , with @xmath56 the total energy density , @xmath57 the pressure , @xmath58 the specific internal energy , and @xmath59 the rest - mass density  @xcite .",
    "the important difference between the rmhd and imhd equations is that they involve stiff relaxation terms that pose serious numerical limitations on the time evolution of the equations .",
    "for this reason , a distinct class of implicit - explicit evolution methods has been developed , the rkimex schemes  @xcite , which we have presented in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .      to close the system of equations presented above ,",
    "a relation for the electric current density in terms of the other fields is necessary , just like ohm s law provides a prescription for the spatial conduction current to be proportional to the electric field .",
    "a generalized ohm s law provides the necessary coupling of the electric current density to the electromagnetic and matter fields .",
    "previous work toward relativistic versions of the generalized ohm s law includes the investigations in refs .",
    "@xcite . in one of the simpler cases the spatial conduction current can be considered as proportional to the electric field measured by the comoving observer .",

    "similarly , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are , respectively , the electric field and the electrical conductivity of the medium ( which is a rank-2 symmetric tensor ) as measured in the same frame . in collisional plasmas the current in the comoving frame can be considered to be carried by the mobile electrons , with charge @xmath65 , and the conductivity tensor becomes @xmath66 with @xmath67 being the magnetic field in the comoving frame , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 the electron collision time scale .    expressing the four - current density of eq .   in terms of the fields measured by the eulerian observer we arrive at @xmath71 + \\nonumber \\\\ \\phantom{= } & w\\sigma\\xi^2(e^\\alpha b_\\alpha)[b^\\mu-\\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\alpha}v_\\nu e_\\alpha-(v_\\nu    b^\\nu)v^\\mu)]\\ , \\label{eq : ohm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in deriving eq .",
    "we have made the implicit assumption that the collision frequency between particles is much larger than the typical oscillation frequency of the plasma , which , we recall , is defined as @xmath72 .",
    "this implies that electrons and ions can reach equilibrium on very short time scales and any correction due to the mass difference between electrons and protons can be neglected . as a result , there is no global charge separation and the plasma is neutral .",
    "note also that the first term in eq .   accounts for an isotropic scalar law for the current , while the rest represent anisotropies due to the presence of a magnetic field in the comoving frame .    ideally , it would be desirable to have a well - defined prescription of the conductivity tensor as a function of the fluid properties , @xmath73 , which stems from the microphysical properties of the plasma ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "in practice , however , we are far from having such a prescription in the extreme physical conditions characterizing merging neutron stars . however ,",

    "the isotropic part of the conductivity is the dominant one ( electrons essentially slide along the magnetic - field lines ) , and expression can be approximated as @xmath76 . as a result , the spatial three - current density in the eulerian frame coming from the generalized ohm s law can be simplified so that @xmath77\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used the fact that the four - current density can be also written as @xmath78 . in our simulations ,",

    "the last term in eq .   represents the hall effects , which , however , we set to zero for simplicity .",
    "the evolution of the spacetime ( i.e. ,  of the 3-metric , extrinsic curvature , and conformal factor ) is obtained using the ` mclachlan ` code , which implements the bssnok formulation of the einstein equations  @xcite employing three - dimensional finite - differencing operators for calculating the fluxes on the right - hand side of the einstein equations  @xcite .",
    "the time integration is carried out using the third - order accurate strong stability preserving implicit - explicit runge  kutta scheme outlined in ref .",
    "the time step on each grid is limited by the courant  friedrichs  lewy ( cfl ) condition  @xcite and hence the courant coefficient is set to be @xmath80 on all refinement levels .",
    "a kreiss  oliger type dissipation is added to the spacetime evolution equations to ensure that any high - frequency noise produced during the evolution ( mostly at the refinement levels boundaries ) is damped .",
    "the damping parameter in the evolution equation for the shift was carefully chosen to be @xmath81 so that the additional term does not become stiff on the coarser grids .",
    "the general - relativistic rmhd ( gr - rmhd ) equations are solved with the ` whiskyrmhd ` code @xcite , which uses high - resolution shock - capturing schemes  @xcite . in particular , the reconstruction of the conserved variables is achieved via the piecewise parabolic method  @xcite , while the fluxes are calculated through the approximate riemann solver introduced by harten  lax  van leer",
    " einfeldt  @xcite and which requires only knowledge about the maximum characteristic speeds of the system , i.e. ,  the speed of light in this case .",
    "the system of rmhd equations is closed by describing the fluid as ideal and with a @xmath82-law eos @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this eos is clearly an idealization .",
    "much more sophisticated eoss have been implemented in our numerical infrastructure  @xcite and have been used by other groups in general - relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) simulations  @xcite . however , this idealization is probably adequate at this stage as here we are mostly interested in assessing the differences introduced in the dynamics of the bmp by resistive effects .",
    "these effects suffer from even larger uncertainties than those associated to the different eoss .",
    "our code makes use of the ` cactus `  @xcite computational framework , which allows us to employ a box - in - box vertex - centered adaptive mesh refinement grid hierarchy that tracks the `` center of mass '' of the stars as they orbit each other .",
    "this was achieved via the ` bnstracker ` thorn implemented by w. kastaun and the ` carpet ` driver  @xcite .",
    "the numerical domain consists of six levels of refinement with the resolution doubling between adjacent refinements .",
    "in addition , we employ moving refinement boxes in order to track the high - density regions . the outer boundary of the computational domain is located at @xmath86 .",
    "the finest resolution during the inspiral and merger is @xmath87 , but an extra refinement level is activated right after the merger with a resolution of @xmath88 .",
    "it is important to remark that , although in a small region of spatial extent @xmath89 , this resolution is considerably higher than the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite ( i.e. ,  @xmath90 with a spatial extent of @xmath91 ) , where the first evidence was given that the merger of a binary system of magnetized neutron stars can lead to the formation of a magnetic - jet structure . hence , although in a resistive framework , the simulations reported here can be considered as a `` higher - resolution '' counterpart of those presented in ref .",
    "we also note that when considering initial data consisting of a binary in quasicircular orbits ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : bns : lifetime ] ) we do not activate the extra refinement level after the merger , hence keeping a resolution of @xmath92 to describe the hmns .",
    "we do this so as to have two different resolutions to describe the hmns and hence to study the numerical consistency of the solution .    to reduce the computational cost associated with the numerical evolution of an equal - mass binary , we use a reflection - symmetry condition across the @xmath93 plane and a @xmath94-symmetry condition across the @xmath95 plane .",
    "these conditions respect the symmetries of the scenario we are investigating .",
    "the outer boundary conditions are set by using simple zeroth - order extrapolation of the hydrodynamic variables .",
    "for the electromagnetic and spacetime variables , we employ simple sommerfeld radiative boundary conditions because of the nature of the fields .",
    "given the long time scale over which our simulations are carried out , reflections due to imperfections of the boundary conditions experience several domain crossings before the end of the simulation .",
    "we plan to improve on this in the future by the application of maximally dissipative boundary conditions that minimize the effects of reflections .",
    "our goal with the use of a rmhd framework is that of modelling the exterior of the neutron stars as an electrovacuum , where both the conductivity and the charge density are negligibly small , so that electromagnetic fields should obey in these regions the maxwell equations in vacuum . on the other hand , we want to model the interior of the stars as highly conducting , so that our equations recover the imhd limit in such regions",
    "there are several different ways to achieve this ; see , for example , refs .  @xcite",
    "each of them has , in our view , its advantages and disadvantages . however , because they all try to model the difficult transition region between two regimes that are intrinsically different , they all represent an approximation .",
    "this difficulty is not specific to this problem but is a typical feature of physical problems as , for example , in the transition from an optically thick to an optically thin regime in radiative - transfer calculations .",
    "our approach is also an approximation and is similar to the one in refs .",
    "@xcite in the sense that the matching from the stellar interior to the stellar exterior is achieved through a carefully chosen conductivity profile .",
    "more specifically , the conductivity profile adopted is directly related to the conserved rest - mass density ( and hence to the rest - mass density ) and given by @xmath96},\\,0\\right]\\ , , \\label{eq : bns : conductivityprofile}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 corresponds to a uniform scalar conductivity .",
    "the parameters @xmath98 , and @xmath99 determine how sharp the transition to the exterior is .",
    "for the simulations reported here , we have chosen represents the ohmic diffusion time scale , with @xmath100 the typical length scale of the field . for @xmath101 , @xmath102 , which is obviously much larger than the timescale over which our simulations are carried out , i.e. ,  @xmath103 . ] , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the values of the conserved and primitive rest - mass density in the `` atmosphere . ''    we recall that , as in other eulerian hydrodynamics and mhd codes , also our ` whiskyrmhd ` code makes use of a very low rest - mass density fluid to handle the evolution of the mhd equations in regions which are associated to the exterior of the stars .",
    "in such a region , we follow the same prescription initially implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite and then adopted in essentially all of the simulations performed with our code , even in its imhd incarnation  @xcite .",
    "in essence , we treat as atmosphere any region in the computational domain which is below @xmath108 , which we take here to be @xmath109 , that is approximately 8 orders of magnitude smaller than the maximum rest - mass density . , where @xmath110  @xcite .",
    "] in such a region , we set the fluid 3-velocity to zero , the rest - mass density to a floor value , and the specific internal energy to the value it assumes for a fluid following a polytropic eos  @xcite .",
    "in addition , and differently from the imhd implementation of ref .",
    "@xcite , the use of the prescription automatically sets the conductivity in the atmosphere to zero , so that the maxwell equations reduce there to the maxwell equations in vacuum .",
    "hence , in our prescription the atmosphere is de facto a cold , static , uniform fluid in which electromagnetic waves propagate as if in vacuum .",
    "a few remarks should be made about modelling the neutron stars exterior , which in reality is expected to be a highly conducting , low - density , possibly magnetically dominated plasma in very strong magnetic fields .",
    "first , with our prescription for the atmosphere and with the conductivity , the latter is zero also in regions that are not at the atmosphere level but close to it , i.e. ,  at @xmath111 .",
    "we do this because the strong winds that are produced at the merger and later on rapidly fill the computational domain .",
    "a direct consequence of this is that the atmosphere is present only close to the boundaries and therefore an imhd prescription would be met essentially everywhere .",
    "yet , we are interested in deviations from perfect - flux freezing and in particular in regions where plasma is tenuous and the magnetic fields essentially decouple from the matter .",
    "we can effectively achieve this by setting @xmath112 in any region that is below @xmath113 .",
    "this approach therefore accomplishes our goal of decoupling in the low - density regions the evolution of the electromagnetic fields from the dynamics of the plasma .",
    "of course , an electrovacuum prescription where the rest - mass density is nonzero is , strictly speaking , inconsistent , but we believe that this is a tolerable inconsistency , given that the rest - mass density in these regions takes essentially the smallest values in the whole domain .",
    "second , albeit somewhat arbitrary , our approach suffers from the same uncertainties of other approaches suggested in the literature to match the two different regimes ( see , e.g. ,  refs .",
    "ideally , its robustness can be validated by varying the free parameters @xmath99 and @xmath108 , although this is something that admittedly we are not able to do here because of the computational costs involved .",
    "more importantly , we find that this approach allows us to take an important step beyond the previous imhd treatment presented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "third , while matching to a force - free regime is appealing , it can be rather dangerous in the physical conditions encountered _ after _ the merger ( by contrast , the force - free approximation is probably very good before the merger or in black hole ",
    "neutron - star binaries , when only magnetospheric effects are expected to take place ) .",

    "0.5 cm   0.5 cm   0.5 cm     after black - hole formation , the plasma dynamics in the funnel is far from being stationary and continues with repeated bursts having a period of about @xmath163 . while a more detailed discussion of these bursts is postponed to sec .",
    "[ sec : bns : bursts ] , it is useful to remark here that the ejected material does not have sufficient energy to reach large distances away from the black hole .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that , although the magnetic field is comparatively strong , the material in the funnel is still matter dominated , with @xmath164 .",

    "[ fig : bns : omega ] ) .",

    "the vertical flow very close to the black hole is _",

    "[ fig : bns : sigma ] ) .",
    "this has two important consequences .",
    "first , the dynamics of the electromagnetic fields in this region is not that prescribed by the imhd equations but rather that of electromagnetic waves in vacuum . at the same time , because of its ( comparatively ) small rest - mass density and pressure , the matter in the funnel tends to move along the field lines .",
    "we should clarify that this behavior is not achieved because the test - particle limit of the rmhd equations is reached ( the rest - mass density and pressure are in fact nonzero ) but rather because the matter in the funnel can only move in the vertical direction , either accreting onto the black hole or moving outward ( the matter in the funnel has low or zero specific angular momentum ) .",
    "modelling the dynamics of the matter in the funnel is among the most challenging aspects of these calculations .",
    "although the matter there has the largest magnetic - pressure support ( i.e. ,  @xmath169 ) , this is still about 4 orders of magnitude away from being magnetically dominated .",
    "the reason for this behavior is most likely due to the comparatively weak magnetic fields that we are able to build in the funnel at these resolutions and the short evolution times .",
    "second , the zero - conductivity plasma in the funnel is just adjacent to the high - conductivity plasma of the torus ; this large jump in the conductivity helps in preserving the magnetic - jet structure and in providing a natural agent for the collimation of the flow at low latitudes .",
    "it is useful to remark that in close analogy with what found in ref .",
    "@xcite the magnetic - jet structure produced here is _ not _ a relativistic outflow . instead , it can just be viewed as an almost quasistationary magnetic structure confining the tenuous plasma in the funnel and confining it away from the dynamics of the ultradense plasma in the torus .",
    "in fact , despite the resistive losses , the plasma in the funnel does not have yet sufficient internal energy to be able to launch a relativistic outflow .",

    "equally natural is to expect that a toroidal component will start to develop away from the axis and as one approaches the regions filled by the torus .",

    "the resulting shearing boundary layer could be the site for the development of a kelvin  helmholtz instability , which unfortunately we can not investigate at the present resolutions and without a more sophisticated treatment of the conductivity in the transition between large and small values ( the instability does potentially develop in a particularly difficult region ) .",

    "@xcite .",
    "a word of caution should be spent before concluding this section .",
    "while the behavior described above appears reasonable and is possibly the expected one on the basis of rather simple considerations , this behaviour is ultimately the result of our choice for the conductivity profile in eq . and of our choice of rest - mass density in the atmosphere .",

    "we have already commented that one of the major differences between the imhd and rmhd simulations is that our implementation of the latter allows for a description of propagating electromagnetic waves in vacuum . by contrast , the atmosphere treatment of the imhd implementation is such that it does not evolve the magnetic field as the fluid velocities are reset to zero there . as a result , already after the first @xmath180 the magnetic field manages to diffuse out of the stars , heating up the plasma in the outer layers and forcing it to expand . in this way , magnetic energy is converted into internal energy , and therefore the magnetic field at the center of the stars is ( slightly ) lower than in the corresponding imhd simulation .",
    "in contrast , the magnetic field along the @xmath156-axis in the rmhd simulation is higher than in the imhd simulation in the first few milliseconds .",
    "indeed , the differences between the imhd and rmhd simulations become particularly evident after black - hole formation , when the funnel is evacuated and the magnetic - jet structure is built ( see the bottom panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : bns : spt_far1 ] and [ fig : bns : spt_far2 ] ) .",
    "the magnetic diffusivity in the rmhd simulation acts so rapidly that in a bit more than one crossing time the whole computational domain in the rmhd run is filled with electromagnetic fields despite the fact that the magnetic field was initially constrained to the stellar interior .",

    ",  @xmath181 in imhd vs @xmath182 in rmhd ) .",
    "this is due ( mainly ) to the intense currents produced by the rapidly rotating torus and ( partly ) to the magnetic - field diffusion of the strong magnetic field in the torus , which diffuses across the walls of the funnel .",
    "this behavior of the magnetic field is in fact similar to the one observed in a stable magnetized star with extended magnetic fields which was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where after an initial transient , the system relaxed to a solution consisting of a large - scale , nearly electrovacuum , dipolar magnetic field configuration in the exterior , which was anchored to the highly conducting neutron star .",

    "the maximum lorentz factors achieved after the collapse in both simulations is @xmath183 , with the highest values occurring at the end of the simulations .",
    "the magnetic field in the torus is also stronger in the rmhd simulation than the corresponding field in the imhd run , although the differences in this case are only of 1 order of magnitude .",
    "the reason for this has to be found in the fact that in the rmhd simulation the torus is more massive and therefore able to sustain larger amounts of magnetic fields ( as for isolated stars , also a self - gravitating torus in mhd equilibrium will be able to sustain stronger magnetic fields for increasing masses ; cf . ,",

    "after the merger takes place at @xmath185 , the maximum rest - mass density oscillates at the @xmath176-mode frequency and experiences a sudden drop when an apparent horizon is found since matter inside the apparent horizon is excluded from the calculation of @xmath184 .",
    "it is quite obvious that the behavior of @xmath184 is different in the two simulations , with the hmns in the rmhd surviving for a longer time .",

    "[ fig : bns : rho ] is the evolution of a simulation in which the set of rmhd equations is used together with a large and uniform conductivity @xmath186 ( red solid line ) . in this case , despite the very different set of equations solved and the different approach for enforcing the divergence - free condition of the magnetic field , the rmhd evolution should mimic the imhd one .",
    "this is indeed the case , and it provides considerable confidence on the robustness of our rmhd approach .",
    "it suggests that the delayed collapse is an effect associated with the choice of physical resistivity and not due to numerical artifacts .    despite the complex dynamics , the differences between the imhd and rmhd runs are not difficult to explain . as mentioned in the previous section , in fact ,",
    "an important difference between the imhd and rmhd simulations is that in the latter the magnetic field can not be perfectly locked with the plasma . as a result ,",
    "the imhd evolution is more efficient in redistributing the angular momentum in the system and , in particular , in transporting it outward .",
    "this magnetic - braking process deprives the hmns core of the angular - momentum support , and this leads to an earlier collapse . clearly , since the conductivity in the hmns interior is very high also in the rmhd simulation ( although not infinite ) , magnetic flux freezing is very efficient here as well and the differences in the dynamics of the imhd and rmhd simulations can only be small .",
    "this explains why overall the time of collapse varies by only @xmath187 .",
    "in addition , the important differences in this dynamics are also expected to take place in the outer layers of the hmns , where the conductivity decreases as a response to the conductivity profile  .",
    "we should note that the difference in the lifetime of the hmns is not related to the use of initial data with modified momenta , but is present also for a binary of which the initial data is on a quasicircular orbit .",

    "[ fig : bns : angularmomentum ] , which reports the spacetime diagrams along the @xmath175-direction of the specific angular momentum @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "( see @xcite for a discussion in the differences in the two definitions ) . ]",
    "the left panel refers to @xmath191 , the specific angular momentum of the rmhd run , while the middle panel refers to the corresponding quantity for the imhd simulation , @xmath192 , and the right panel refers to the relative difference : @xmath193 .",
    "a rapid inspection of the left and middle panel reveals that in both the rmhd and imhd simulations the specific angular momentum increases outward ( as it should for a rotating fluid satisfying the rayleigh stability criterion ) , but also that the profiles are not constant in time and show instead periodic variations that are in phase in the two simulations .",
    "these variations reflect the large oscillations of the hmns , and , indeed , the oscillations in @xmath194 take place at the same frequency as those in the rest - mass density and shown in the other spacetime diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : bns : spt_far1 ] ( note the different scale in the @xmath175-axis ) . however , there are important small differences in the dynamics of @xmath191 and @xmath192 , which are apparent in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bns : angularmomentum ] , where regions in red indicate that the specific angular momentum in these regions is higher ( of @xmath195 ) in the imhd simulation than in the rmhd simulation , while blue regions are exactly the opposite .",
    "it is apparent that the differences are larger in the central parts of the hmns , while the specific angular momenta are very similar in the outer layers , i.e. ,  for @xmath196 .",
    "we recall that an excess of specific angular momentum at a given position on the @xmath175-axis reflects fluid elements that are rotating at a larger frequency ( @xmath197 in the newtonian limit ) and this is indeed what one would expect if the magnetic fields and the fluid are tightly coupled .",
    "hence , the red regions in the right panel fig .  [ fig : bns : angularmomentum ] can be taken to signal a more efficient transfer of angular momentum from the inner regions of the hmns .",
    "a direct consequence of this transfer of angular momentum is the appearance of blue regions adjacent to the red ones and signalling therefore fluid elements that have slowed down .",
    "although the differences in @xmath191 and @xmath192 are small , the transfer continues steadily and with an increased rate up to @xmath198 , when a much larger transfer of angular momentum takes place .",
    "this signals the onset of the instability to gravitational collapse in the imhd simulation , which effectively takes place soon after , i.e. ,  at @xmath199 .",
    "three remarks should be made before concluding this section .",
    "first , the fact that an rmhd simulation with a uniform conductivity yields the same collapse time as an imhd simulation gives us great confidence about the correctness of the rmhd evolution with nonuniform conductivity . second , although the difference in the survival time between the rmhd and imhd evolution is here rather small , it can be much larger if smaller values of the resistivity are chosen for the stellar interior and for less massive hmnss ; unfortunately present astronomical observations do not set any stringent constraint on the values of the conductivity at these temperatures , rest - mass densities , and magnetic fields .",
    "more importantly , however , a longer survival time is a useful new result in the modelling of binary neutron stars , as it points out that the hmns can survive on comparatively longer time scales than those computed so far in pure hydrodynamics or in imhd simulations .",
    "this is not a minor detail as the most recent modelling of sgrbs with an extended x - ray emission invokes the existence of a magnetized hmns that is able to survive on time scales of the order of @xmath200 before collapsing to a black hole @xcite .",
    "finally , computational constraints have prevented us from extending much past black - hole formation the evolution of the rmhd / imhd simulations with initial data on quasicircular orbits .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that already the dynamics of the hmns is unaffected by the initial reduction in linear momenta and that the hmns collapses to a black hole earlier in both cases , provides us with confidence that the magnetic field dynamics discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : bns : magjet ] will be very similar also for binaries on quasicircular orbits .",
    "this will also be the focus of our future work .              in secs .",
    "[ sec : bns : magjet ] and [ sec : spd ] , we have already discussed the properties of the evolution of the magnetic fields , but have not quantified in detail how the magnitude of the magnetic field changes with time and how this evolution varies in the rmhd and imhd simulations .",
    "this is done now in fig .",
    "[ fig : bns : mag ] , where we report the evolution of the maximum of the modulus of the magnetic field ( black lines ) but also of its toroidal ( red lines ) and poloidal ( blue lines ) components , either in the rmhd simulation ( left panel ) or in the imhd simulations ( middle panel ) .",
    "note that the evolution of the magnetic field in the two implementations is very similar during the inspiral , but also that this changes considerably after the merger .",
    "while in both cases the toroidal magnetic field grows exponentially , the growth is of about 1 order of magnitude in the imhd simulation but of a factor 2 smaller for the rmhd simulation .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic field reaches values of @xmath201 just before the collapse in the imhd simulation and @xmath202 only just after the merger in the rmhd simulation .",
    "this different behavior is not difficult to explain and is simply due to the fact that the shearing of magnetic - field lines is less efficient in rmhd because of the finite conductivity of the matter . because the growth at the merger is mostly due to the shear layer between the two impacting stars",
    ", it is quite natural that a resistive calculation will lead to a smaller magnetic field , quite independently of how well the instability is resolved .    as for the rest - mass density ( cf . ,  fig .",
    "[ fig : bns : rho ] ) , the collapse of the hmns to a black hole leads to a rapid decrease of the maximum value of the magnetic field , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bns : mag ] where the vertical lines signal the first appearance of the apparent horizon .",
    "also in this case , the strongest magnetic fields are hidden inside the horizon , and the maximum values reported are those relative to the magnetic field in the torus . as remarked already when commenting on the spacetime diagrams in sec .",
    "[ sec : spd ] , the larger values of the magnetic field in the rmhd simulation are the result of a more massive torus produced in this case ( cf . ,  table [ tab : bns : bhtorus ] ) .    in the right panel of fig .",

    "we recall that the imhd simulation makes use of a constrained transport scheme @xcite , and hence it is able to maintain the violations of this constraint down to machine precision . the rmhd simulation , on the other hand , makes use of a divergence - cleaning scheme @xcite , which is widely known to be less efficient in suppressing the violations .",

    "[ sec : bns : features ] and [ sec : spd ] , we have already anticipated that a wind is produced after the merger , either as a result of shock heating at the merger or because of magnetic winding and consequent pressure imbalance in the outer layers of the hmns or because of neutrino losses  @xcite .",
    "in addition to an almost quasistationary and quasi - isotropic wind , both the rmhd and the imhd simulation show the existence of mildly anisotropic and quasiperiodic launching of low rest - mass density , high internal energy blobs of matter that we will refer to as bursts .",
    "overall , seven bursts are launched during the total time of the simulation , with five bursts relative to the hmns stage and two being produced after black - hole formation .    in particular , the first two bursts eject material that is moving through the low - density atmosphere with an average speed of @xmath206 but that decelerate as they move away from the hmns , reaching a final outward velocity of @xmath207 .",
    "this behavior is in part due to the natural conversion of kinetic energy to binding energy but also to the interaction of the bursting material with the slow isotropic wind .",
    "this interaction , which is obviously accompanied by shocks , provides a damping mechanism on the propagation of the ejected material .",

    "the increase in the specific internal energy is of slightly less than 2 orders of magnitude and is followed by a slower decay .    as already mentioned in sec .",

    "the characteristic frequency of these peaks is related to the @xmath176-mode frequencies of the bar - deformed hmns  @xcite and thus these bursts occur every @xmath209 .",
    "similar peaks ( although less marked ) can be observed also in the magnetic field along the @xmath156-axis ( cf . ,  fig .",
    "[ fig : bns : spt_far2 ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "the difference is that they occur slightly later than the specific internal energy ones , possibly indicating a conversion of kinetic energy into magnetic energy and vice versa .",
    "the rest - mass density in the blobs of low - density material ejected in the bursts depends on height , but , at a distance of @xmath210 along the @xmath156-axis , it is @xmath211 , while the magnetic field , at the same location , has a strength of @xmath212 .",
    "the bursting activity continues also after the collapse , but with somewhat different properties .",

    "second , the rest - mass density of the blobs ejected is smaller and of the order of @xmath214 , while the magnetic field oscillates between @xmath215 and is stronger probably as a result of the magnetic field increase in the funnel .    with only two bursts observed after black - hole formation",
    ", the time span is too short to reach a firmer conclusion on the origin of the bursts after the collapse .",
    "however , all present evidence seems to suggest that the postmerger bursts are triggered by an increased mass - accretion rate as the torus approaches the black hole during the inward phase of its epicyclic oscillation .",
    "of course also resistive reconnection processes could lead to the conversion of magnetic energy into internal energy and thus may be invoked to explain this phenomenology .",
    "we find this not a likely explanation mostly because of the ordered magnetic field structure that builds up in the funnel and which seems rather stationary . clearly , a more detailed study of long - term evolutions with different prescriptions for the conductivity profiles is necessary before reaching more robust conclusions .",
    "we finally note that the outflows produced either by shock - heating , magnetically driven winds or by the periodic bursts , eject a substantial amount of matter .",

    "@xcite is about 2 orders of magnitude larger , and this facilitates substantially the loss of mhd equilibrium at the surface of the hmns and thus the mass loss .      because the magnetic field is not strong enough to alter the torus dynamics significantly  @xcite , it is natural to expect the two solutions ( imhd and rmhd ) to be very similar in terms of dynamical properties once a nearly quasistationary state is established after the collapse to a black hole .",

    "indeed , we have found that the electrovacuum luminosity before the merger is @xmath230 , which is smaller than the one reported in  ref.@xcite ( i.e. ,  @xmath231 ) , where the stellar exteriors were modelled in the force - free approximation .",
    "although it has already been found that the electrovacuum luminosity is slightly smaller than the force - free one for the same system ( see refs .",

    "the increased lifetime of the hmns appears to be due to a less efficient magnetic - braking mechanism in the resistive regime , in which matter can move across magnetic - field lines , so that the outward transport of angular momentum is reduced . this interpretation is supported by the analysis of the evolution of the specific angular momentum , and it shows that the transport is more efficient in the imhd simulation .",
    "an extended lifetime of the hmns could have intriguing astrophysical consequences , since a longer - lived magnetized hypermassive neutron star brings support to the recent modelling of sgrbs in terms of long - lived magnetarlike objects produced by the merger  @xcite .",
    "another important result of these simulations is the confirmation that a magnetic - jet structure is formed in the low - density funnel produced by the black hole  torus system .",
    "we note that these simulations have been carried out at higher resolutions and with a different grid structure than those in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the rmhd simulations",
    "the magnetic - jet structure is far more regular , essentially axisymmetric , and extending out to the largest scale in our system .",
    "this is most likely the result of the effective decoupling established between the dynamics of the plasma and that of the electromagnetic fields . in the imhd simulations , a magnetic - jet structure is still present , but on the scale of the torus",
    "this difference is due to the fact that a decoupling of the electromagnetic fields from the plasma is not possible in the imhd approximation , and the magnetic field follows tightly the turbulent dynamics of the matter . in this case , the magnetic - field lines are almost parallel to the @xmath156-axis ( in analogy with what was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the topology becomes more turbulent on large scales . in both regimes , the magnetic field is predominantly toroidal in the highly conducting torus and predominantly poloidal in the nearly evacuated funnel , although in the imhd simulation , this happens near the rotation axis .",
    "the matter in the funnel does not have an internal energy sufficiently large to launch a relativistic outflow .",
    "however , it is reasonable to expect that reconnection processes or neutrino annihilation occurring in the funnel , none of which we model here , could potentially increase the internal energy in the funnel .",
    "the final comment of this work is in fact a caveat .",
    "while the dynamics of the magnetic - field results presented here appears reasonable , matching the expectations for this type of system as well as previous simulations , we should remark that our results are ultimately dependent on the choice made for ohm s law and for the conductivity profile .",
    "again , while our choice is a very conservative and a plausible one , it represents a choice nevertheless .",
    "the large computational costs associated with these simulations have prevented us from presenting a systematic investigation of how sensitive the results are on the choices for ohm s law , for the conductivity profile , or on the treatment of the atmosphere .",
    "all of these issues deserve further investigation and will be the focus of our future work .",
    "we thank w. kastaun for the visualization library used for the two - dimensional plots and are grateful to b. mundim and k. takami for their valuable comments on the manuscript .",
    "we appreciate useful discussions with n. andersson , i. hawke and c. palenzuela regarding ideas and further applications of resistive - mhd in astrophysical scenarios .",
    "finally , we thank b. giacomazzo for help with the initial data and the ideal - mhd code .",
    "partial support comes from the science and technology facilities council stfc , grant no .",

    "the simulations were performed on supermuc at lrz - munich , on datura at aei - potsdam , on the dirac bluegene / q cluster at university of edinburgh - acsp33 , and on the loewe at csc - frankfurt .",
    "although the imhd simulations are not the focus of this paper , for completeness we provide in this appendix a rapid overview of the properties of the magnetic - jet structure as obtained within this approximation .",
    "the essence of the results is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_and_b_xz_large.imhd ] , which represents the equivalent of fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_and_b_xz_large ] but within imhd .",
    "the different panels show large - scale , two - dimensional snapshots on the @xmath146 planes of the rest - mass density ( top row ) , and of the magnetic field ( bottom row ) . the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_and_b_xz_large.imhd ] refers to @xmath238 ( left column ) , when the hmns has not yet collapsed to a black hole , while the right column refers to @xmath239 , when a black hole has already been formed . because in the imhd approximation the magnetic fields are tightly locked with the matter , it does not come as a surprise that no ordered magnetic field structure seems to develop before the hmns collapses and forms a black hole .",
    "this is because the dynamics of the plasma is quite turbulent at the merger and during the hmns stage .",
    "however , after a black hole is formed , a well - ordered magnetic - field structure appears as the system reaches a quasistationary state .",
    "we note again that the formation of a magnetic - jet structure occurs around the black - hole rotation axis .         differently from the corresponding rmhd simulation ,",
    "the magnetic - jet structure here is not very regular on large scales , and it is necessary to go down to the length scale of the torus , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : rho_and_b_xz.imhd ] , for the magnetic - jet structure to become evident .",
    "note that the magnetic - field lines are almost parallel to the @xmath156-axis , in analogy with what was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . finally , although we are here using only the projection of the magnetic - field lines on the @xmath146 plane , the magnified view in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_and_b_xz.imhd ] reveals that the magnetic field in the low - density funnel is still predominantly poloidal , although not as ordered as in the rmhd simulation ( cf . ,  fig . [",
    "fig : bns : rhob6 ] , left and right panels ) . at the same time , and not shown here for compactness , the magnetic field is essentially toroidal in the torus ."
