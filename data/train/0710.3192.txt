    "m85 optical transient 2006 - 1 ( m85ot2006 - 1 ; j122523.82@xmath10181056.2 ) was discovered on 2006 jan 6 by the lick observatory supernova search team ( filippenko et al .",

    "subsequent spectroscopy , as well as visible light and infra - red ( ir ) photometry , presented in kulkarni et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , showed that m85ot2006 - 1 has a recession velocity of @xmath13  km  s@xmath14 , and is therefore associated with m85 .",
    "moreover , we showed that the temporal and spectral properties of this object are unlike those of supernovae , novae , or luminous blue variables .",
    "m85ot2006 - 1 peaked at absolute @xmath15-band magnitude of about @xmath16 .",
    "the light curve settled into a @xmath17  day plateau , followed by a decrease in bolometric luminosity during which the black - body emission peak shifted toward near - ir wavelengths .",
    "the early spectrum of m85ot2006 - 1 , obtained six weeks after discovery , resembles that of a @xmath18  k black body , with h@xmath19 and h@xmath20 narrow emission lines ( full width at half maximum of @xmath21kms@xmath14 ) , along with several other unidentified emission lines .",
    "spitzer ir observations obtained about six months after the discovery revealed a @xmath22k black body spectral energy distribution ( rau et al . 2007 ) .    the spectral and temporal properties of this object resemble those of m31-rv ( discovered by rich et al .",

    "2002 ; bond et al . 2003 ; corradi & munari 2007 ) , and possibly the less studied object v4332  sgr ( martini et al . 1999 ) . however , the m85 transient is the most luminous member of the v838  mon class .",
    "the favored model for this emerging class of v838  mon - like objects ( also known as luminous red novae ) is that they are the result of stellar mergers ( e.g. , soker & tylenda 2006 ) .",
    "however , other models have been suggested to explain these objects ( e.g. , retter & marom 2003 ; lawlor 2005 ) .",
    "the nature of these events , with their energetics lying between the realms of supernovae and novae , remains uncertain .    in this paper , we present hubble space telescope ( hst)- advanced camera for surveys ( acs)/wide field camera ( wfc ) and near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) observations , as well as palomar 5 m spectroscopy , of the environment of m85ot2006 - 1 .",
    "the observations are used to characterize the environment of the transient and to set a limit on the mass of the progenitor .",
    "m85 was observed using hst / acs on 2003 as part of the hst - acs virgo cluster survey ( ct et al .",
    "subsequently , the transient was observed serendipitously with acs / wfc and nicmos / nic2 in 2006 ( go-10515 ) as a follow - up study to peng et al .",

    "v838  mon - like objects are found in both young regions ( e.g. , v838mon ; afar & bond 2007 ) and old stellar populations ( e.g. , m31rv ; bond & siegel 2006 ) .",
    "m85ot2006 - 1 took place in an early - type galaxy . therefore , as we explain below , it can be used to set an upper limit on the minimal progenitor mass that can produce v838  mon - like eruptions .    from the 2-dimensional spectrum , shown in fig .",
    "[ m85_2d_spec ] , we can set an upper limit on the flux of the h@xmath19 emission at the location of m85ot2006 - 1 of @xmath44ergs@xmath45s@xmath14 , at the @xmath46 level ( equivalent to luminosity of @xmath47  ergs  s@xmath14 ) .",

    "[ spitzer_mips70 ] , we can set an upper limit on the star formation rate in this region to be less than @xmath51  m@xmath7  yr@xmath14 ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",

    "an independent limit on the age and mass of the progenitor can be inferred from the absence of stars brighter than @xmath2-band absolute magnitude @xmath54 in the transient environment . from the lejeune & schaerer ( 2001 ) stellar tracks",
    ", we find that stars older than 50  myr ( and therefore , more massive than 7  m@xmath7 ) do  not reach @xmath2-band absolute magnitudes brighter than @xmath54  mag ( at the red - supergiant stage ) .",
    "we note that the @xmath2-band stellar track magnitudes were obtained by interpolation of the @xmath15 and @xmath55-bands .",
    "therefore , we can set a lower limit on the age of the most massive stars in the transient environment to be @xmath56  myr , which corresponds to mass @xmath6  m@xmath7 ( assuming solar metallicity ) . otherwise , we were likely to detect individual stars in this region .",
    "we note that we can limit the extinction in the transient location to @xmath57  mag , based on the balmer lines ratio , assuming case - b recombination ( kulkarni et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "ferrarese et al .",
    "( 2006 ) reported possible faint wisps and patches of dust in m85 .",
    "moreover , schweizer & seitzer ( 1992 ) reported that m85 is somewhat bluer than typical s0 galaxies , therefore possibly younger .",
    "this claim is supported by terlevich & forbes ( 2002 ) who estimated the age and metallicity based on line indices . they have found a mean luminosity - weighted age of @xmath58gyr and metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath59 and [ mg / fe]@xmath60 .",
    "we note that the actual mean age is probably higher than that indicated by line indices given that younger populations have higher weight than old population .",
    "if the mean age is representative of the progenitor of m85ot2006 - 1 , then we can set a lower limit of about @xmath61gyr on the age of m85ot2006 - 1 progenitor / s .",
    "this further suggests that the mass of the progenitor / s is probably below @xmath9",
    "m@xmath7 ( the life time of solar metallicity @xmath62  m@xmath7 stars is @xmath63  gyr ; lejeune & schaerer 2001 ) .",
    "this limit is based on the mean stellar age of this galaxy .",
    "however , stars younger than 1  gyr may be present in this galaxy in relatively small numbers .",
    "although several models exist for v838  mon - like objects ( e.g. , soker & tylenda 2003 ; lawlor 2005 ) , in the absence of detailed simulations , the nature of these objects remain elusive . a clue to their origin",
    "can be derived from their environment , luminosity function and rate .",
    "given that only a small number of these objects are known , and they were found serendipitously in various searches , the luminosity function and rate are not well constrained .",
    "however , the fact that at least two events were observed in our galaxy ( i.e. , v838  mon and v4332  sgr ) in the last @xmath64 years suggests that they have a higher rate than sne .",
    "we can set a lower limit on their rate , of @xmath65yr@xmath66l@xmath67 , at the @xmath68 confidence level , where l@xmath69 is the milky way luminosity .",
    "now we discuss the implications of our observations for a specific model for v838  mon - like objects .",
    "soker & tylenda ( 2006 ) presented a model for violent stellar mergers in which , prior to the merger , the spins and orbital frequencies of the binary star are losing synchronization due to the darwin instability ( e.g. , eggleton & kiseleva - eggleton 2001 ) .",
    "they found that for a given primary mass , the maximal energy production obtained for a binary mass ratio of @xmath70 , is @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the mass and radius of the primary star .",
    "given the upper limit on the progenitor mass , based on the mean stellar age in m85 , @xmath75  m@xmath7 , and assuming a main - sequence mass - radius relation , @xmath76 , the maximum available energy in their model is short by a factor of three in the total energy production , as compared to the radiated energy of m85ot2006 - 1 in the first two months , @xmath77  ergs ( assuming a distance of @xmath12  mpc to m85 ; mei et al .",
    "moreover , it is expected that a large fraction of the energy will go into lifting the outer region of the star rather than radiated away .",
    "furthermore , if the primary is an evolved star , then its radius will be larger than the radius of a main sequence star with the same mass , and the extracted energy will be even smaller .",
    "this suggests that either more detailed modeling of violent stellar mergers is required , or that this event is not the result of a violent stellar merger .",
    "another possible solution is that the mass of the progenitor is somewhat larger",
    ". a larger progenitor mass will still be consistent with our upper limit of @xmath78  m@xmath7 which is based on the absence of stars brighter than @xmath79  mag .",
    "for example , according to soker & tylenda ( 2006 ) model , a @xmath78  m@xmath7 progenitor can yield @xmath80 times more energy than a @xmath9  m@xmath7 progenitor and may explain the discrepancy .",
    "we note , however , that other kinds of instabilities can lead to stellar mergers ( e.g. , in triple systems ) and that the above comparison is valid only for the specific case discussed by soker & tylenda ( 2006 ) .",
    "existing hydrodynamical simulations of the common envelope phase in stellar mergers ( and also star @xmath10 neutron star mergers ) predict that the total dissipated energy is of the order of that observed in v838mon and m85ot2006 - 1 ( e.g. , taam & bodenheimer 1989 ; terman et al . 1995 ; terman & taam 1996 ) .",
    "moreover , simulations of the common envelope phase predicts that most of the envelope will be ejected in the equatorial plane ( e.g. , taam & ricker 2006 ) .",
    "indeed , in rau et al .",
    "( 2007 ) we reported evidence suggesting that the expansion of m85ot2006 - 1 is asymmetric .",
    "however , more detailed hydrodynamical simulations of the vast parameter space available for stellar mergers are needed in order to understand these processes and to test if v838mon - like objects are indeed the results of stellar mergers .    to summarize ,",
    "we show that , in contrast to v838mon , but similarly to m31rv , m85ot2006 - 1 was probably produced by members of an old stellar population ( @xmath81gyr ) , and that its progenitor / s mass was probably @xmath82m@xmath7 .",
    "these constraints narrow down the allowed venue of stellar models for the nature of this event ."
