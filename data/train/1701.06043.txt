    "the @xmath2 states belonging to the spinflip @xmath1 resonance in even - even nuclei can also be excited in small - angle inelastic proton scattering at energies of a few hundred mev because angular momentum transfer @xmath21 is favored in these kinematics and the spin - isospin part dominates over the isoscalar - spin and tensor parts of the proton - nucleus interaction @xcite .",

    "we perform a multipole decomposition analysis ( mda ) @xcite of the @xmath3ca@xmath29 data to extract the spinflip @xmath1 cross sections , which can then be converted to @xmath6 transition strengths with the aid of the method described in ref .",
