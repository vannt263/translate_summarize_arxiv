    "r - parity conserving minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is the most studied scenario of physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "searching for supersymmetric particles is an essential part of experimental programs of future colliders .",
    "obviously the search strategy is strongly dependent on mass and mixing patterns of the susy particles , especially on an assumption about lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "usually , the lightest neutralino is taken as the lsp .",
    "the sneutrino can be considered as an another candidate for lsp .",
    "however , lep1 data exclude this possibility for left `` sneutrino @xcite . it should be emphasized that this statement is valid for superpartners of left - handed neutrinos . on the other hand ,",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments show that neutrinos have non - zero masses and it turns out that right - handed neutrinos must exist .",
    "thus superpartners of the right - handed neutrinos should be included into the mssm .",
    "as noted in @xcite the lep1 data does not essentially constrain the masses of superpartners of the right - handed neutrinos if their mixings with left '' sneutrinos are sufficiently small .    in this paper",
    "we present a scenario which assumes the superpartner of right - handed neutrino ( right `` sneutrino ) to be the lightest supersymmetric particle ; which is hereafter called rs - lsp scenario . + in section 2",
    "we illustrate that right '' sneutrino can be the lsp and analyze constraints on mass and mixing of right \" sneutrino coming from lep1 data .",
    "next in section 3 we briefly discuss decay chains of susy particles in this scenario . a search for sneutrino at future linear colliders",
    "is considered in section 4 .",
    "finally , we give some concluding remarks in section 5 .",
    "the huge number of free parameters @xcite in the three family mssm leads to consideration of some simplified versions , such as the constrained mssm ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in general , these simplifications ignore interfamily mixings and possible existence of right - handed neutrinos , and consequently their super - partners . as a result one avoids possible conflicts with experimental data on flavor violating processes .",
    "but at the same time we miss very interesting possible phenomenology . in this study",
    "we deal with the three family mssm and do not consider possible r - parity violation , as well as gut and sugra extensions .",
    "there are a number of arguments favoring the existence of right - handed neutrinos .",
    "first of all , in the framework of the sm @xmath0 s are counterparts of the right - handed components of the up - type quarks according to the quark - lepton symmetry .",
    "then , almost all extensions of the sm , with the su(5 ) gut as a possible exception , naturally contain right - handed neutrinos .",
    "finally , as it was mentioned in introduction , observation of the neutrino oscillations provides the experimental confirmation for @xmath0 . for these reasons we consider three family mssm with right - handed neutrinos",
    ". therefore we deal with the six species that constitute a family , rather than five species considered in [ 5 ] ( in the argument given below , we adopt the notations used in this paper ) : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , where @xmath1 and @xmath4 denote weak iso - doublets and the rest are iso - singlets .",
    "the masses of the sm fermions and their super - partners are generated due to @xmath7 the first term has the form @xmath8 where a labels six species mentioned above , the tilde labels sparticle and i , j=1,2,3 are family labels .",
    "therefore this part contains six @xmath9 hermitian mass matrices .",
    "each matrix contains six real parameters and three phases .",
    "the yukawa part of the lagrangian is derived from the superpotential    @xmath10    where four yukawa matrices @xmath11 are general @xmath9 matrices .",
    "each of these matrices contains nine real parameters and nine phases .",
    "finally , the triscalar part is given by    @xmath12     + where a are general @xmath9 matrices and m is some mass parameter . here in eq .",
    "( 4 ) in order to avoid confusion with eq .",
    "( 3 ) we introduce the notations which are slightly different from that in @xcite . as a result",
    "we have 108 real parameters ( masses and mixing angles ) and 90 phases . however ,",
    "part of them are unobservable because of @xmath13 symmetry of the gauge sector , so 18 angles and 34 phases can be rotated out and remaining two phases correspond to baryon number in quark sector and general lepton number . finally , matter sector of the mssm ( fundamental fermions and their superpartners ) contains 90 observable real parameters , namely 36 masses and 54 mixing angles , and 56 phases .",
    "now let us recall the main assumptions of the flavor democracy i.e. , democratic mass matrix hypothesis ( in the framework of the n family sm ) : + i ) before the spontaneous symmetry breaking fermions with the same quantum numbers are indistinguishable .",
    "therefore yukawa couplings are equal within each type of fermions @xcite : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "+ ii ) there is only one higgs doublet , which gives dirac masses to all four types of fermions .",
    "therefore yukawa constants for different types of fermions should be nearly equal @xcite : @xmath18 .",
    "+ the first statement result in n-1 massless particles and one massive particle with @xmath19 ( f = u , d , l , @xmath20 ) for each type of the sm fermions .",
    "the masses of the first n-1 families , as well as observable interfamily mixings , are generated due to a small deviation from the full flavor democracy @xcite .",
    "taking into account the mass values for the third generation , the second statement leads to the assumption that the fourth sm family should exist .",
    "alternatively , masses of up and down type fermions should be generated by the interaction with different higgs doublets , as it takes place in the mssm .",
    "it is straightforward to apply flavor democracy to the mssm . for example according to the flavor democracy",
    ", sneutrino mass matrix has the form @xmath21 + as a result we deal with four massless sneutrinos and two sneutrinos having the masses @xmath22 the ( small ) masses of the remaining four species can be generated due to the violation of flavor democracy .",
    "including f- and d - term contributions , the elements of the matrix ( 5 ) have the following form @xcite : @xmath23 + where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the supersymmetry - conserving higgs mass parameter .",
    "+ in @xcite it is shown that lep1 data leads to a lower bound 44.6 gev on the sneutrino masses and , consequently in the framework of the constrained mssm @xcite , left `` sneutrino can not be the lsp .",
    "but lep1 data does not essentially constrain the masses of superpartners of the right - handed neutrinos if the lr mixings are sufficiently small . indeed , the contribution of the right '' sneutrino to the invisible z width is given by @xmath30 + where @xmath31 denotes the left `` sneutrino fraction due to corresponding mixings and @xmath32 mev . the experimental value",
    "@xmath33 mev leads to @xmath34 for sufficiently light right '' sneutrino .",
    "if there are two light species one obtains @xmath35 . therefore right \" sneutrino still can be considered as the lsp both in constrained and unconstrained mssm .",
    "decay chains of susy particles depend on their masses and mixing patterns . in general one",
    "has to deal with a @xmath36 mass matrix for up - type and down - type squarks , charged sleptons and sneutrinos .",
    "following @xcite , we ignore the interfamily mixings so that in the sneutrino sector we are left with @xmath37 for each family . from now on @xmath38 is assumed to be the lsp , so that it is stable due to r - parity conservation . in this case",
    "the parameter @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( 8) is going to be @xmath39 .",
    "the mass patterns of sleptons and squarks are assumed to satisfy @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the masses of @xmath38 and @xmath43 , respectively . if @xmath44 the sole two body decay mode is @xmath45 . for heavier @xmath43 , two additional decay modes @xmath46 and @xmath47 do appear . in fig .  [ 1 ] decay width @xmath48 is plotted as a function of @xmath41 for the following chosen values of @xmath49 gev and 200 gev .",
    "decay widths @xmath50 and @xmath51 are plotted in fig .  [ 2 ] as functions of @xmath52 and @xmath53 with @xmath54 gev .",
    "dependences of these decay widths on @xmath55 are shown in fig .  [ 3 ] by taking @xmath54 gev and @xmath56 gev . as it is seen from figs .",
    "[ 1]-[3 ] , @xmath57 when @xmath55 is less than 0.2 and @xmath58 gev .",
    "we have four processes @xmath59 ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) in rs - lsp scenario instead of one process @xmath63 in mssm without right neutrino ( we should remember that we ignore interfamily mixings and consider only the first lepton family ) .",
    "these processes proceed via t - channel @xmath64 exchange and s - channel z boson exchange .",
    "the differential cross - sections for the processes @xmath65 @xmath61 , @xmath66 are obtained as follows : @xmath67}{16\\pi s^2}\\delta\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath68=@xmath69 and @xmath70}\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{(2\\sin\\theta_w-1)(s - m_z^2)}{2\\cos^2\\theta_w[(s - m_z^2)^2+\\gamma_z^2m_z^2](t-\\tilde{m}_w^2)^2}\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the differential cross - section for @xmath65 @xmath71 is obtained from the general expression eq .",
    "( 10 ) with the replacements @xmath72 and @xmath73 and for @xmath65 @xmath74 with the replacements @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "in the case of @xmath77 we obtain the well - known formula for @xmath78 @xcite . for numerical evaluations center of mass energy",
    "is taken 500 gev , and the values @xmath79 , @xmath80 gev , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 are used . in figs .",
    "[ 4 ] and [ 5 ] we plot total cross sections of the processes @xmath84 and @xmath85 as functions of @xmath42 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "the cross section of the process @xmath86 is shown in fig .  [ 6 ] as a function of @xmath42 by setting @xmath87 .",
    "finally , for illustration we give the @xmath55 dependence of @xmath88 in fig .",
    "[ 7 ] by taking @xmath54 gev and @xmath87 .    in rs - lsp scenario",
    "@xmath38 is stable and hence the process @xmath85 is not observable . in principle",
    "the process @xmath89 is observable , but it has too small cross - section for @xmath90 .    for the process @xmath59 the most spectacular manifestation is two z bosons which are not coplanar , with missing energy due to @xmath91 and @xmath92 . assuming these decays are dominant and considering leptonic decays @xmath93 and @xmath94 we expect 700 events per year for an integrated luminosity at 100 fb@xmath95 . for the process",
    "@xmath86 we consider two possibilities . in the first @xmath96",
    "is dominant decay mode , and in the second @xmath97 is dominant . in the first case",
    "we expect 90 mono - z decaying into @xmath98 and @xmath99 , with large missing energy . in the second case",
    "we expect 1500 @xmath98 pairs which are not coplanar , with large missing energy .",
    "the rs - lsp scenario should be seriously considered as an alternative to the neutralino - lsp scenario .",
    "obviously in the first case decay chains of the supersymmetric particles drastically differ from those of the second case .",
    "therefore the rs - lsp scenario should be taken into account in the susy search programs of future colliders . in this paper the process",
