    "creating and studying quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the laboratory has been the goal of experiments at cern sps and recently at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) facility in brookhaven national laboratory , soon to be continued by the alice collaboration at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "rhic experiments have revealed robust collective phenomena in the form of radial and elliptic flows , which turned out to be quite accurately described by near - ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "qgp thus seems to be the most perfect liquid known , with the smallest viscosity - to - entropy ratio @xmath2 .",
    "recently , the @xmath3 duality has been proposed , and used to explain unusual properties of the qgp @xcite : in this so - called  magnetic scenario \" , the near-@xmath4 region is dominated by magnetic monopoles .",
    "an important feature is the opposite running of the electric coupling @xmath5 and the magnetic one @xmath6 , induced by the dirac condition @xmath7 .",
    "as recently shown in @xcite , this feature has been dramatically confirmed by the behavior of the lattice correlation functions @xcite , which indeed display monopole - monopole and antimonopole - monopole correlations @xmath8 with @xmath1 .",
    "we consider the correlations observed in @xcite to be a decisive confirmation of the existence of the long - distance magnetic coulomb field of the monopoles .",
    "it is natural to investigate the role played by these objects in the qgp : we therefore address the issue of qgp transport properties in the `` magnetic scenario '' framework @xcite .",
    "we move away from the phase transition region to higher temperatures , where qgp is still dominated by the usual electric quasiparticles  quarks and gluons  and the coupling is moderately small .",
    "our goal is to study the interaction between electric and magnetic sectors .",
    "our main result is the explicit solution of the problem of quantum gluon - monopole scattering , from which we calculate the corresponding transport cross sections .",
    "the problem of quantum gluon - monopole scattering is solved in the pointlike monopole approximation . in this case , and for @xmath9 , the equations for the radial functions @xmath10 reduce to generalized bessel - like equations with noninteger index @xmath11 $ ] , where @xmath12 is the product of electric and magnetic couplings and @xmath13 is the total angular momentum quantum number fm @xcite . ] : @xmath14t_{j\\alpha}(\\xi)=0 .",
    "\\label{bessel}\\ ] ] the index @xmath15 runs from 0 to 9 and indicates all possible combinations of charge and spin polarization for gluons . after gauge fixing , three combinations turn out to be unphysical , and only six survive .",
    "the radial solution of the gluon - monopole scattering is easy ; the complications reside in the angular functions .",
    "in fact , classically the gluon moves on the surface of a cone ; the angular functions therefore are modified vector spherical harmonics that describe the conical motion in the classical limit of large angular momentum .",
    "the scattering phase that we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ bessel ] ) is @xmath16 , independent of energy .",
    "this feature is very important , since the contribution of this kind of scattering to thermodynamics is given by the beth - uhlenbeck formula @xmath17 which vanishes identically for a constant scattering phase .",
    "therefore , we find that the gluon - monopole scattering does not contribute to thermodynamics .",
    "there is an exception to this result , for @xmath18 . in this case",
    ", the gluon can penetrate the monopole core and form bound states .",
    "we do nt discuss this case here , for all details we refer the reader to ref .",
    "the scattering amplitude @xmath19 is given by the following formula : @xmath20 where @xmath21 the sum over @xmath13 has an upper cutoff @xmath22 : in matter there is a finite density of monopoles . a sketch of the setting , assuming strong correlation of monopoles into a crystal - like structure , is shown in the left panel of fig . [ fig_monos_2d ] .",
    "a `` sphere of influence of one monopole''(the dotted circle ) gives the maximal impact parameter to be used . as a result",
    ", the impact parameter is limited from above by some @xmath23 , which implies that only a finite number of partial waves should be included .",
    "the range of partial waves to be included in the scattering amplitude can be estimated as @xmath24 . since at asymptotically high @xmath1 the monopole density @xmath25 is small compared to the density of quarks and gluons @xmath26 , @xmath22 asymptotically grows logarithmically with @xmath1 .",
    "so , only in the academic limit @xmath27 one gets @xmath28 and the usual free - space scattering amplitudes calculated in @xcite where all partial waves are recovered .",
    "however , in reality we have to recalculate the scattering , retaining only several lowest partial waves from the sum . taking the lattice results on the monopole density as a function of the temperature @xcite , we estimate @xmath29 in our temperature regime .",
    "this dramatically changes the angular distribution , by strongly depleting scattering at small angles and enhancing scattering backwards .",
    "this is evident in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_monos_2d ] , where we show the angular distribution of the integrand of the transport cross section @xmath30 : @xmath31 the integrand exhibits a strong peak backwards , which would disappear in the absence of @xmath22 .",
    "we now proceed to evaluate the scattering rate of gluons on monopoles : @xmath32 where the @xmath33 indicates an average over the incoming gluon .",
    "@xmath34 is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and is @xmath35 gev@xmath36 in our temperature regime .",
    "the gluon density has the following form : @xmath37 = \\frac{4\\pi}{(2\\pi)^3}\\int k^2dk\\rho_g(k , t ) \\label{gluondensity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have taken into account the suppression of electric particles due to the coupling with the polyakov loop ( see for example @xcite ) : @xmath38 is a temporal background gauge field related to the polyakov loop . in the average over the incoming gluon",
    ", we have to take this suppression into account by integrating over @xmath39 with the weight @xmath40 .",
    "we show @xmath41 in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_viscosity ] ( the red , continuous line ) . also shown is the same quantity for the @xmath42 scattering process ( black , dotted line ) . the approximate relation of the scattering rate to viscosity / entropy ratio is @xmath43 we plot @xmath2 in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_viscosity ] .",
    "we observe a qualitative agreement between our results and the experimental value for @xmath2 observed at rhic , which is indicated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_viscosity ] as a green box .",
    "our present results however deal with the purely gluonic sector of qcd only . for a more quantitative and meaningful comparison with rhic results ,",
    "quarks need to be incorporated in the analysis .",
    "our main finding is that the contribution of gluon - monopole scattering is very important for transport properties .",
    "while the monopole density may be small , the @xmath44 scattering amplitudes have @xmath45 coupling instead of small @xmath46 . furthermore ,",
    "in our setting ( with a limited number of partial waves @xmath47 included ) there is an additional enhancement for large angle ( or even backward ) scattering .",
    "it follows from this comparison of the gluon - monopole curve with the gluon - gluon one that the former remains the leading effect till very high @xmath1 , although asymptotically it is expected to get subleading .",
    "the maximal @xmath1 expected at lhc does not exceed 4@xmath4 , where the total @xmath48 .",
    "this value is well in the region which would ensure hydrodynamical radial and elliptic flows , although deviations from ideal hydro would be larger than at rhic ( and measurable ! ) .",
