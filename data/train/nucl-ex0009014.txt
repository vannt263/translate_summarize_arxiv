    "@xcite that photon production rates in the qgp when calculated up to two loop diagrams , are considerably greater than the earlier lowest order estimates@xcite . following this result , srivastava  @xcite has shown that at sufficiently high initial temperatures the photon yield from quark matter may significantly exceed the contribution from the hadronic matter to provide a direct probe of the quark matter phase .",
