    ", a universal form factor is required for each light degree of freedom state of the meson . to compute the isgur - wise ( iw ) functions @xmath5 , where @xmath11 , requires considerable knowledge of the heavy - light meson dynamics .",
    "for this reason , the iw function is usually thought of as `` model - dependent '' and not susceptible to reliable calculation . in the first portion of this paper",

    "the iw function thus depends only on the dimensionless slope parameter @xmath1 and one dimensionless function @xmath57 which is essentially the heavy - light wavefunction .",

    "this prediction is not completely rigorous as the size of the effect is of order a few percent and second - order @xmath96 corrections could be of that order .",
    "in addition , the lattice calculation for @xmath109 has currently been calculated only to tree level , but a 1-loop calculation is underway @xcite . however , the preliminary indication is that @xmath100 is less than the central value of 0.62 which comes from qcd sum rules . at the same time",
    "however , the much smaller values of @xmath100 which come from isgw2 and the salpeter model are also disfavored because they produce a result for @xmath109 which is too negative .      in this case , there is additional information provided by the @xmath111 decay distribution @xcite . as suggested by cln @xcite and followed by cleo @xcite this decay can be analyzed in terms of the @xmath30 form factor and two ratios of form factors .",
    "the cleo experiment , which to date has the best measurements of the @xmath16 form factor paramaters , has adopted the convention of fitting the slope of @xmath30 , @xmath112 and two form factor ratios : @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",

    "the slope difference @xmath125 can be related to the zero - recoil quantities , @xmath68 above .",
    "it is therefore possible in the near future to test ( for the first time ) the `` intercept '' quantities @xmath68 by direct comparison to experiment . at this point only @xmath124 has been computed in lattice simulation @xcite , but the corresponding values of @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 could be evaluated .",
    "at present the experimental situation @xcite is also not precise enough : @xmath129 but this result can also be considerably sharpened .",
    "we emphasize that the above prediction ( [ muds ] ) is an important check of the values of the intercepts , @xmath68 , which are in turn of critical importance in the extraction of the ckm parameter @xmath130 .    in the heavy quark limit , @xmath131 .",
    "these ratios deviation from unity , experimentally and theoretically , indicates deviation from heavy quark symmetry and , consequently , can test theoretical predictions for the symmetry - breaking corrections .",
    "the measurements of @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( currently with large error bars ) agree with theoretical predictions , and thus roughly confirm the predictions of hqet . here",
    "we investigate the exact nature of the predictions and their value as tests of hqet .    treating the form factor ratios as constants , while reasonable theoretically and necessary for the fit , makes the tests of symmetry - breaking corrections less informative .",
    "@xmath134 and @xmath135 are essentially reduced to @xmath136 and @xmath137 , and because many of the corrections vanish at @xmath12 , they can not be tested .",
    "for example , the subleading isgur - wise function @xmath138 which has only been calculated up to the errors inherent to qcd sum rules is completely lost in this procedure .",
    "if we apply the expressions given in appendix a to the various form factors at @xmath12 , eliminate those corrections which vanish at zero - recoil , and express the results in terms of the wilson coefficients and subleading iw form factors , we obtain : @xmath139           + \\frac{4\\chi_2(1)}{2m_c}(r^*-1 )       + \\bar{\\lambda}(\\frac{1}{2m_b}-\\frac{r^*}{2m_c } ) } { c_1 ^ 5(1)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we use the theoretical estimates as rough guides to the size of each term , we can determine what predictions are actually being tested .",
    "the subleading combination @xmath140 is expected to be small on the basis of the @xmath99 considerations and is further reduced by @xmath141 .",
    "consequently , after evaluating the wilson coefficients @xmath142 ( see table i of appendix a ) , @xmath132 must be greater than unity and provides a fairly direct probe of the hqet parameter @xmath143 , which is the light degrees of freedom energy to this order .      in the expression for @xmath133 ,",
    "@xmath144 is generally agreed to be quite small and @xmath145 .",
    "thus after calculating the wilson coefficients , a measurement of @xmath133 provides an additional probe of the value of the subleading form factor @xmath100 . using the wilson coefficients in appendix a , as well as @xmath146  gev , @xmath105  gev , @xmath147 and @xmath106  gev ,",
    "the expression for @xmath133 becomes @xmath148 the term containing @xmath100 is the dominant correction as @xmath144 is small , so a precise measurement of @xmath133 effectively measures @xmath100 .",
    "we have addressed the question of how to analyze semileptonic @xmath3 decay while minimizing both the amount of theoretical assumption and the number of parameters .",
    "we first establish that specifying the slope parameter @xmath1 accurately determines the entire isgur - wise function .",
    "to do so , we need only an approximation to the light degrees of freedom wavefunction provided by a qcd simulation .",

    "we observe that by altering the iw slope @xmath1 to @xmath152 the physical form factors can be expressed as @xmath153 where @xmath152 .",
    "that this works well is shown by fig .",
    "[ iwcomp ] .    from the above we",
    "conclude that semileptonic data are parametrized by an intercept value @xmath154 and an effective isgur - wise slope parameter @xmath155 . to find the ckm element @xmath130 one must use a theoretical estimate of @xmath68 .    for @xmath10 decay",

    "we further point out that @xmath132 is nearly model - independent while @xmath133 depends sensitively on various estimates of the subleading from factor @xmath159 .",
    "also , the value of the form factor @xmath160 at zero - recoil , @xmath99 , appears to offer an additional probe of the value @xmath159 .",
    "finally , one might ask , what is the essential advantage of the slope shift scheme described here ?",
    "the answer is , economy of parameters and a decoupling from theoretical assumptions . as seen in fig .",
    "[ iwcomp ] , one of the effective iw function slopes is equivalent to an ( unknown ) iw slope with subleading corrections .",
    "if these corrections were securely known our scheme offers no advantage . on the other hand ,",

    "we believe that it is best to rely as little as possible on theory and to use a direct phenomenological approach . as pointed out previously@xcite , one must have some theoretical constraint on the curvature term in ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) .",
