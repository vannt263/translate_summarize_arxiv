    "the theoretical study of the nonrelativistic heavy quark - antiquark system @xcite and its application to bottomonium @xcite and toponium @xcite physics is of special interest because it relies entirely on the first principles of qcd .",
    "the system in principle allows for a perturbative treatment with the nonperturbative effects being well under control and with no crucial model dependence .",
    "this makes the heavy quarkonium to be an ideal place to determine the fundamental qcd parameters such as the heavy quark mass @xmath0 and the strong coupling constant @xmath1 .",
    "recently an essential progress has been made in the theoretical investigation of the nonrelativistic heavy quark dynamics based on the effective theory approach @xcite .",
    "the analytical results for the main parameters of the nonrelativistic heavy quark - antiquark system are now available up to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in the strong coupling constant and the heavy quark velocity @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the nnlo corrections have turned out to be so sizeable that it appears to be indispensable also to gain control over the next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath3lo ) both in regard of phenomenological applications and in order to understand the structure and the peculiarities of the nonrelativistic expansion . in this",
    "talk we review the first steps in this direction and consider two particular classes of n@xmath3lo corrections : ( i ) the retardation effects arising from the emission and absorption of dynamical ultrasoft gluons by the heavy quarks and ( ii ) the corrections enhanced by a power of @xmath4 which are not generated by the renormalization group ( rg ) running of @xmath1 .",
    "in this section we briefly outline the effective theory approach to the nonrelativistic heavy quark dynamics .",
    "let us consider the near threshold behavior of the heavy quark vacuum polarization function @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the heavy quark vector current .",
    "its imaginary part is related to the normalized cross section of @xmath8 production in the photon mediated @xmath9 annihilation at energy @xmath10 @xmath11 by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fractional charge of quark @xmath14 .",
    "the behavior of the vacuum polarization function near - below the threshold @xmath15 determines also the masses and leptonic widths of the perturbative heavy quarkonium bound states .    near the threshold",
    "the heavy quarks are nonrelativistic so that one may consider the quark velocity @xmath16 as a small parameter .",
    "an expansion in @xmath2 may be performed directly in the lagrangian of qcd by using the framework of effective field theory . in the nonrelativistic problem",
    "there are four different scales @xcite : ( i ) the hard scale ( energy and momentum scale like @xmath0 ) ; ( ii ) the soft scale ( energy and momentum scale like @xmath17 ) ; ( iii ) the potential scale ( energy scales like @xmath18 while momentum scales like @xmath17 ) ; and ( iv ) the ultrasoft scale ( energy and momentum scale like @xmath18 ) .",
    "the ultrasoft scale is only relevant for gluons . by integrating out the hard scale of qcd one arrives at the effective theory of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite . if one also integrates out the soft scale and the potential gluons one obtains the effective theory of potential nrqcd ( pnrqcd ) which contains potential quarks and ultrasoft gluons as active particles @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the quarks is governed by the effective nonrelativistic schrdinger equation and by their interaction with the ultrasoft gluons . to get a regular perturbative expansion within pnrqcd this interaction",
    "should be expanded in multipoles .",
    "the corrections from harder scales are contained in the wilson coefficients leading to an expansion in @xmath1 as well as in the higher - dimensional operators of the nonrelativistic hamiltonian corresponding to an expansion in @xmath2 .",
    "the nonrelativistic expansion in @xmath1 and @xmath2 provides us with the following representation of the heavy quark vacuum polarization function near threshold @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the @xmath8 energy counted from the threshold , @xmath21 is the square of the hard renormalization coefficient of the nonrelativistic vector current and the ellipsis stands for the higher - order terms in @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath22 is the nonrelativistic green function which sums up the @xmath23 terms singular near the threshold .",
    "it is determined by the schrdinger equation which describes the the propagation of the nonrelativistic quark - antiquark pair in pnrqcd @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the nonrelativistic hamiltonian defined by @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the coulomb potential , @xmath28 is the eigenvalue of the quadratic casimir operator of the fundamental representation of the color group , @xmath29 and the ellipses stands for the higher - order terms in @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the green function has the spectral representation @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the wave functions of the @xmath8 bound and continuum states respectively .",
    "below the threshold the vacuum polarization function of a stable heavy quark is determined by the bound state parameters . for the leading order coulomb ( c )",
    "green function the energy levels and wave functions at the origin read @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "note that for the study of the bound - state parameters we have @xmath36 so that we are only dealing with one expansion parameter .",
    "the current status of the theoretical research can be summarized as follows .",
    "the effective nonrelativistic hamiltonian is known in the nnlo approximation including the two - loop corrections to the static potential @xcite and the corresponding corrections to the green function have been obtained in analytical form in @xcite . the @xmath37 contribution to the hard renormalization coefficient",
    "has been computed in @xcite .",
    "thus the complete nnlo analytical expression for the nonrelativistic heavy quark vacuum polarization function is now available . in the next section we present the recent results of the calculation of some n@xmath3lo order corrections to the heavy quarkonium parameters .",
    "let us start with a few general remarks concerning the structure of higher - order corrections in pnrqcd . at next - to - leading order ( nlo )",
    "the only source of corrections is the perturbative corrections to the hard renormalization coefficient and the static potential . in nnlo",
    "the higher - dimensional operators start to contribute . in n@xmath3lo the retardation effects which can not be described by operators of instantaneous interaction",
    "enter the game .",
    "the retardation effects are induced by the emission and absorption of virtual ultrasoft gluons which `` feel '' the binding effects of quark - antiquark interaction @xcite .",
    "this constitutes a genuinely new feature which is absent in nlo and nnlo and is supposed to be the last qualitatively new source of the corrections .",
    "the leading retardation effects which are under consideration here arise from the chromoelectric dipole interaction @xmath38 of heavy quarkonium with virtual ultrasoft gluons .",
    "the corresponding diagram is shown in fig .",
    "= 19.9 cm = 13.1 cm    an interesting distinction from the similar qed process is that after emitting the ultrasoft gluon the quark - antiquark pair converts into the color octet sate with repulsive coulomb potential @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the eigenvalue of the quadratic casimir operator of the adjoint representation of the color group . as a consequence the intermediate color octet states belong to the continuum part of the spectrum only .",
    "the result for this ultrasoft contribution diverges in the ultraviolet ( uv ) region .",
    "this divergence is spurious .",
    "it arises in the process of scale separation due to the use of pnrqcd perturbation theory at short distances where it is inapplicable .",
    "we use the dimensional regularization ( dr ) with @xmath41 space - time dimensions to handle the uv and infrared ( ir ) divergences of the effective theory which are of the form @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) as @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "compared to the `` traditional '' nrqcd approach endowed with an explicit momentum cutoff and a fictitious photon mass to regulate the ultraviolet and infrared behavior @xcite this scheme has the advantage that the contributions from the different scales are matched automatically . in the total n@xmath3lo result",
    "the poles in @xmath45 in the ultrasoft contribution are canceled by the infrared poles coming from the hard and soft scale corrections .",
    "however since these corrections are still unknown we subtract the divergent part according to the @xmath46 scheme .",
    "this means that the same scheme must be used for the calculation of the hard and soft scale corrections . as a consequence",
    "the partial result for the ultrasoft contribution depends on the auxiliary ultrasoft scale @xmath47 which drops out in the total result .",

    "their numerical values are @xcite @xmath58      the origin of the logarithmic corrections which are not generated by the rg running of @xmath1 is the presence of several scales in the nonrelativistic dynamics .",
    "the logarithmic integration over a loop momentum between different scales yields a power of @xmath59 and in the approximately coulomb system we have @xmath60 .",
    "these corrections can always be associated with the divergences of the effective theory @xcite . by contrast the rg logarithms",
    "are well known and may be resummed by an appropriate scale choice .    in the heavy quarkonium",
    "the non - rg logarithms first arise in nnlo corrections to the wave functions at the origin .",
    "they are generated by the following @xmath61 operators in the effective nonrelativistic hamiltonian : @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 represents the spin of the quark - antiquark system and @xmath65 denotes the anticommutator .",

    "( [ gf ] ) is canceled by the @xmath37 ir pole of the hard matching coefficient @xmath21 .",
    "thus the scale @xmath67 in the logarithm is to be identified with the hard scale @xmath0 and the sought corrections for the spin one states which are of the main interest read @xcite @xmath68 the residual operators in the nnlo effective nonrelativistic hamiltonian which are not contained in eq .",
    "( [ delham1 ] ) correspond to the purely perturbative corrections to the static coulomb potential .",
    "the corresponding corrections to the wave functions at the origin @xcite contain rg logarithms of the form @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) which vanish for @xmath71 .",
    "this also holds in n@xmath3lo for the rg logarithms of the form @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) because the ultrasoft effects enter the stage only in n@xmath3lo so that the corresponding running of the strong coupling constant at the ultrasoft scale only becomes relevant in n@xmath74lo .",
    "an important point here is that starting from nnlo the hard matching coefficient @xmath21 receives a nonvanishing anomalous dimension . therefore starting from n@xmath3lo the running of @xmath1 in @xmath21",
    "should be taken into account to match the scale dependence of the wave functions at @xmath75 .",

    "not that one has to exclude the one photon annihilation contribution from the positronium result because this is absent in qcd due to the color conservation .",

    "numerically the non - rg logarithmic corrections are comparable to the contribution from the n@xmath3lo rg logarithms which may be estimated from the renormalization scale dependence of the nnlo result . the effect of the n@xmath3lo logarithms is twofold .",
    "the normalization of the cross section is reduced by about 10% around the @xmath100 peak and the energy gap between the @xmath100 peak and the nominal threshold is decreased by roughly @xmath101 .",
    "this partially compensates the effect of huge nnlo corrections .",
    "since the ultrasoft corrections are scheme dependent we do not include them into the numerical analysis .",

    "( [ enret ] ,  [ wfret ] ) the ultrasoft correction to the @xmath100 peak energy is about @xmath103  mev and to the @xmath100 peak normalization is only about @xmath104 due to some cancellations . note that one power of @xmath1 in these equations refers to the ultrasoft gluon interaction and should be evaluated at the ultrasoft scale @xmath91 while the two residual powers of @xmath1 originate from the coulomb green function and should be evaluated at the soft scale @xmath105",
    ".    the stability of the perturbation theory for the @xmath100 peak energy ( but not for its normalization ! ) up to nnlo can be manifestly improved by using an infrared safe mass parameter instead of the pole mass in the analysis @xcite .",
    "we should note that the corrections under consideration are nor related to the rg running of @xmath1 and can not be taken into account by the renormalon based mass redefinition . on the other hand in some cases the behavior of the perturbation perturbation theory",
    "can be improved by using the direct relations between the physical observables @xcite .      in the case of bottom quark - antiquark production",
    "the nonperturbative effects are much more significant and one is led to use the sum rule approach @xcite to get them under control . specifically appealing quark - hadron duality one matches the theoretical results for the moments of the spectral density @xmath106 for sufficiently large @xmath107",
    "the moments are saturated by the near - threshold region .",
    "then the main contribution to the experimental moments comes from the @xmath108 resonances which are measured with high precision . on the other hand for @xmath107 of order",
    "@xmath109 the coulomb effects should be properly taken into account on the theoretical side . in order to analyze the n@xmath3lo logarithmic corrections to the @xmath108 sum rules",

    "( [ enll ] ,  [ wfll2 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ wfsl ] ) .",
    "we fix the strong coupling constant and focus on the determination of the bottom quark mass . at present",
    "this seems to be the most interesting application of the sum rules . in the bottom - quark case @xmath1 at the nominal ultrasoft scale",
    "seems to be too large for a reliable perturbative calculation .",
    "thus to be on the safe side we redefine the ultrasoft scale to be @xmath110 so that in both cases @xmath111 .",
    "we find that the inclusion of the n@xmath3lo logarithms in the sum rules leads to a reduction of the extracted @xmath46 mass value by approximately 150  mev for moderate values of @xmath107 , @xmath112 .",
    "the result essentially depends on @xmath113 and @xmath47 because the scale dependence of the correction is compensated only by higher - order terms .",
    "for example , for @xmath114 the perturbative series for the moments converges much better and the correction to the @xmath46 mass is only about @xmath115  mev .",
    "this result implies that the unsertainty of the value @xmath116  gev obtained from nnlo analysis of @xmath108 sum rules @xcite is at least about @xmath117 mev .    in the case of the @xmath118 meson",
    "the local duality is expected to work though the nonperturbative effects are much more important than in the sum rules approach . if we assume the @xmath118 meson to be a perturbative system the results of sect .",
    "3 can be applied to compute the corrections to its mass which is determined by the binding energy and leptonic width which is determined by the wave function at the origin . in this way",
    "we find that the n@xmath3lo logarithmic correction to the @xmath118 mass is about @xmath119  mev and to its leptonic width is about @xmath120 ( the leading and subleading logarithms are approximately equal ) .",
    "the ultrasoft correction to the @xmath118 mass is about @xmath121  mev and to its leptonic width is about @xmath122 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the perturbative ultrasoft contribution to the leading nonperturbative contribution of the gluonic condensate due to vacuum fluctuations of the gluonic field at the scale @xmath92 which is generated by the similar diagram with the broken gluon propagator shown in fig .",
    "1b in order to conclude how `` perturbative '' the heavy quarkonium is . in the case of the energy level",
    "the leading nonperturbative contribution is given by @xcite @xmath123 using the standard literature value @xmath124  gev@xmath74 we have @xmath125  mev which is of the same scale as the ultrasoft contribution .",
    "in this talk we reviewed the first steps towards the n@xmath3lo analysis of the nonrelativistic heavy quark - antiquark system .",
    "two special classes of n@xmath3lo contributions to the key parameters of heavy quark - antiquark bound states were considered , namely the non - rg corrections enhanced by a power of @xmath4 and the retardation effects .",
    "they are not related to the rg running of @xmath1 and can be considered as typical representatives of the n@xmath3lo corrections .",
    "we gave the numerical estimates of the above corrections for the top and bottom quark systems .",
    "the corrections turn out to be comparable to the nnlo ones and reach 10% in magnitude even in the case of top where @xmath126 . for @xmath118 meson",
    "they are out of control .",
    "this tells us that the nrqcd expansion is not a fast convergent series for the physical value of the strong coupling constant .",
    "it is highly desirable to complete the calculation of n@xmath3lo corrections to get more insight of the nonrelativistic heavy quark dynamics and the structure of the nonrelativistic perturbation theory .",
    "although there is no conceptual problem on the theoretical side this analysis is extremely difficult from the technical point of view and includes , for example , the calculation of the three - loop hard matching coefficient and the three - loop static potential .",
    "finally we would like to mention that the subleading nonperturbative contributions @xcite and charm quark mass effects @xcite which are relevant for the bottom quark physics but numerically are not so important as the perturbative corrections .    *",
