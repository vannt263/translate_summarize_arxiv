    "thought experiments in combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity @xcite-@xcite and also in string theory @xcite show various bounds on accuracy of space - time measurements .",
    "the existence of such bounds implies that space - time can never be observed as a smooth continuous manifold , which is the classical space - time notion in general relativity .",
    "moreover the obvious distinction between space - time and matter fields on it would be an obstacle in pursuit of unification .",
    "especially , it would be nice if space - time and metric tensor can merely be regarded as different sides of a single object . thus search for a satisfactory alternative to the classical space - time notion has theoretical interests .",
    "the notion of fuzzy space would be a possible candidate for such an alternative @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a fuzzy space is defined by the algebra of functions on it , which is allowed to be not only noncommutative but also nonassociative .",
    "therefore a fuzzy space is a generalized notion which includes both the noncommutative @xcite-@xcite and the nonassociative @xcite-@xcite spaces .",
    "since an algebra can be defined by a rank - three tensor , dynamical models of a rank - three tensor , which are denoted by tensor models @xcite-@xcite in this paper , may be regarded as dynamical theory of fuzzy spaces @xcite .",
    "an important advantage of the formalism is that fuzzy analogue of the general coordinate transformation can easily be embedded into such tensor models .",
    "another one is that one can treat various types of spaces in a unified manner , e.g. irrespective of topologies and dimensions .",
    "this possibility to describe dynamical fuzzy spaces in terms of tensor models has been pursued by the present author , and some successful results have been obtained . in @xcite , various classical solutions of tensor models representing fuzzy spaces with some physical interests have been obtained , and their properties have been analyzed . especially in the previous paper @xcite , the number counting of the low - lying fluctuation modes around a specific class of solutions , which represent various dimensional fuzzy flat tori and are denoted by gaussian solutions in this paper , agrees with what is expected from the general relativity .",
    "this result suggests that the effective low - lying physics around the gaussian solutions can be described by the general relativity .",
    "if this truly holds , metric tensor and space come from a single object as mentioned in the preceding paragraph , because the rank - three tensor is the only dynamical variable of tensor models .    although the agreement is non - trivially realized in various dimensions , it is obvious that such number counting is not enough for a definite conclusion .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to go beyond the number counting to conclusively show the agreement .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : tensormodels ] , fuzzy space , tensor models , and gaussian solutions are reviewed . a tensor model with gaussian solutions , which will be analyzed throughout the present paper ,",
    "is given . in section  [ sec : cor ] , a proposal is given of a correspondence between the rank - three tensor of tensor models and the metric tensor in the general relativity .",
    "then the dewitt supermetric with its unique parameter being fixed is derived from a quadratic invariant metric of tensor models .",
    "the supermetric determines the metric fluctuations transverse to the general coordinate transformation . in section  [ sec : numerical ] , numerical analysis of the fluctuation modes is performed for two - dimensional fuzzy flat tori .",
    "conclusive agreement is obtained between the transverse metric fluctuations and the low - lying fluctuation modes of the tensor model .",
    "the low - lying spectra are observed to form a massless trajectory with quartic momentum dependence . in section  [ sec : ren ] , a renormalization procedure for tensor models is proposed .",
    "a classical application is shown to make much clearer the patterns of the low - lying spectra , and also shows the existence of a massive trajectory well over the massless one .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary , conclusions , and discussions .",
    "the idea of regarding tensor models as dynamical theory of fuzzy spaces was originally presented in @xcite . in this subsection",
    ", i will recapitulate the discussions , stressing more on physical motivations .    before describing a fuzzy space ,",
    "let me start with a usual space with coordinates , @xmath2 .",
    "let me only consider the _",
    "real _ functions on the space .",
    "one will be able to take a basis of the space of all the real functions as @xmath3 with an appropriate index set . in some cases , one can choose a basis with indices having some physical meanings such as frequencies , but in general the indices are merely abstract labels .",
    "the algebraic relations among the functions can be parameterized by a real rank - three tensor @xmath4 as [ eq : defofc ] f_a(x ) f_b(x)=c_ab^c f_c(x ) . introducing a rank - two tensor @xmath5 defined by [ eq : gusual ] g_ab = d^dx f_a(x )",
    "f_b(x ) , one obtains [ eq : cusual ] c_abc = d^dx f_a(x)f_b(x)f_c(x ) , where @xmath6 .",
    "here both @xmath5 and @xmath7 are real symmetric tensors , because of the associativity and commutativity of the products among the functions on a usual space .",
    "it is important to note that one can freely take another basis for the function space .",
    "since such a change of basis can be described by a general linear transformation , tensors related by a general linear transformation describe an identical space .",
    "the general coordinate transformation can be embedded into the general linear transformation , because any function can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis functions .",
    "namely , there always exist @xmath8 such that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a transformed coordinate and @xmath11 are the numerical coefficients of expansion .",
    "if @xmath5 and @xmath7 are given and @xmath5 is invertible , one can get @xmath4 in the product rule . as will be explained later at the end of this subsection , it is more convenient to consider the two tensors , @xmath12 and @xmath7 , as the fundamental variables of tensor models rather than @xmath4 itself in the product rule .",
    "the main reason comes from the requirement of the invariance of an action under the general linear transformation , as will be explained at the end of this subsection .    in field theory , the basic variables are fields , which are similar to functions . their product and integration over a space - time are basic operations necessary in extracting physics from field theory , so that the tensors @xmath13 and @xmath7 are more directly related to observables in field theory than a coordinate system itself",
    ". therefore it would be acceptable in physics to describe a space in terms of these tensors , but not by coordinates .",
    "a fuzzy space may be defined by a deformation of the above tensors away from the values corresponding to a usual space .",
    "the type of deformation relevant in this paper is basically a kind of truncation of the function space by introducing a cutoff to high frequency modes without changing the symmetric properties of the tensors @xmath13 and @xmath7 under exchange of the indices .",
    "the cutoff may also be introduced by a cutoff function which vanishes gradually at high frequencies .",
    "such truncation of high frequency modes will make it hard to distinguish nearby points , which makes a space to become  fuzzy \" .    because the symmetry under exchange of the indices of the tensors is assumed in the deformation",
    ", the product rule remains commutative .",
    "however , this kind of deformation generally introduces nonassociativity into the algebra , because truncation of modes breaks closure of an original algebra .",
    "the physical importance of this kind of nonassociative fuzzy spaces comes from the fact that metric can be incorporated into the function algebra , as will explicitly be presented in section  [ sec : cor ] .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with a noncommutative space @xcite-@xcite , where metric is given by an additional element , laplacian @xcite .",
    "the above discussions naturally lead one to suspect that a dynamical theory of fuzzy spaces may be constructed as a dynamical theory of the symmetric tensors @xmath13 and @xmath7 , and may reproduce the general relativity in a certain limit . since a fuzzy space is invariant under the transformation of a basis , tensor models must have a symmetry under the general linear transformation , c_abc&=&m_a^am_b^bm_c^cc_abc , g^ab & = & ( m^-1)_a^a ( m^-1)_b^b g^ab , which is a fuzzy analogue of the general coordinate transformation on a usual space .",
    "therefore an action of a tensor model is a function of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , [ eq : generalaction ] s(g^ab ,",
    "c_cde ) , where the upper and lower indices are contracted for the symmetry requirement . in principle , it is possible to take another set of dynamical variables than @xmath13 and @xmath7 .",
    "however the above choice seems to be the simplest .",
    "for example , one would try to take @xmath4 as its only dynamical variable . then to construct an invariant",
    ", one would need a tensor with more upper indices than lower ones .",
    "one would be able to make such a tensor by an inverse of a matrix @xmath15 , but this would lead to an action singular at the non - invertible values .      the general discussions on tensor models in the previous subsection seem to favor the existence of two kinds of symmetric tensors @xmath13 and @xmath7 as dynamical variables in tensor models .",
    "however , in the actual numerical analysis , treating both as dynamical variables would become too complicated . also from theoretical viewpoints ,",
    "the existence of two independent tensors would introduce more ambiguities into the formalism .",
    "therefore a euclidean tensor model @xcite , which has the non - dynamical rank - two tensor fixed at @xmath16 , will be considered throughout this paper .",
    "it is important to note that such a model is only invariant under an orthogonal subgroup of the general linear transformation .",
    "therefore the direct link between the symmetry of a tensor model and the general coordinate transformation is missing in such a model . however there seem to exist several reasons for the possibility that one may ignore @xmath13 as dynamical variables without changing the essential features of the system as listed in the following . especially it is noteworthy that , because of the following first reason , euclidean tensor models are , so called , background independent theory of space .",
    "* under the assumption that @xmath13 is positive definite as a matrix , it can be diagonalized to @xmath16 by the general linear transformation .",
    "this is a partial gauge fixing of the general linear transformation to the orthogonal subgroup .",
    "therefore , classically , there are no distinctions between a full tensor model and a euclidean one under the positivity assumption . in fact",
    ", the correspondence to the general relativity , which will be discussed later , does not require @xmath13 to be varied .",
    "* in the previous paper @xcite , it is numerically shown that the distribution of the low - lying modes around the gaussian classical solutions of a euclidean tensor model agrees with the general relativity .",
    "* what is really required in a tensor model would be a symmetry which resembles the general coordinate transformation at low - momentum modes .",
    "in general , there are no clear distinctions between the general linear and the orthogonal transformations , if the two are compared only at a small window of low - momentum modes . *",
    "the number of components of @xmath13 is negligible in comparison with @xmath7 in the limit @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the total number of the possible values of an index , e.g. @xmath19",
    ". therefore @xmath13 would not play essential roles in the dynamics in the limit .",
    "thus , in the following discussions , only a euclidean tensor model , [ eq : etensaction ] s(g^ab=_ab ,",
    "c_abc ) , will be considered .",
    "the orthogonal group symmetry of euclidean models is so loose that the explicit form of an invariant action has infinite possibilities . in general the dynamics of the models",
    "will heavily depend on its specific form , and the models have no powers to predict any quantum gravitational phenomena .",
    "presently no principles are known to constrain the choices , but better understanding of the properties of the models might finally lead to a hint for a preferred formulation .",
    "it might also be possible that the models can be classified into a finite number of universality classes , when the thermodynamics or quantum properties are investigated .    in this regard , an obvious direction of study",
    "is to consider the simplest choices of the actions . in the papers @xcite ,",
    "some actions with quadratic and quartic terms in @xmath7 are considered . especially in @xcite , considered is an action the equation of motion of which has various commutative but nonassociative deformations of usual spaces , tori and spheres of various dimensions , as classical solutions .",
    "it is interesting that a single equation of motion contains various physically meaningful solutions corresponding to spaces with various topologies , dimensions , curvatures and sizes .",
    "another direction which has been pursued is to look for relations between tensor models and the general relativity . in the previous paper @xcite , the fluctuation spectra around a specific type of solutions , the gaussian solutions , to a tensor model for one- to four - dimensional tori",
    "are numerically studied .",
    "it was shown that the number of the low - lying low - momentum modes at each momentum sector agrees exactly with what is expected from the general relativity .",
    "it is obvious that such number counting is not enough to definitely prove the relations , and more detailed comparisons are required .",
    "in fact , as will be discussed in section  [ sec : correspondence ] , the gaussian solutions have a natural generalization to incorporate a correspondence between the rank - three tensor in tensor models and the metric tensor in the general relativity .",
    "moreover , they are right on the trajectory of the renormalization procedure proposed in section  [ sec : renproc ] , and can be expected to play significant roles in the dynamics . therefore the gaussian solutions seem to be interesting backgrounds to perform more detailed comparisons with the general relativity . however , the action having such gaussian solutions considered in the previous paper @xcite is very complicated , and it is hard to obtain fully reliable numerical results from the model because of the heavy requirement of machine powers .",
    "therefore , in the following , a much more simpler model having the gaussian solutions will be given .",
    "this model contains a fractional inverse power of a matrix , and therefore can not be considered as a well - defined action for all the values of @xmath7 .",
    "but , as for small fluctuations around the gaussian solutions , this irregularity will not make any harms as can be seen later .",
    "the gaussian solutions have the following gaussian form , [ eq : cx ] | c_x_1,x_2,x_3&=&b , g^x_1,x_2&= & ^d(x_1-x_2 ) , where @xmath20 are positive numerical coefficients , @xmath21 are @xmath22-dimensional continuous coordinates , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is a short - hand notation for @xmath25 . only the euclidean signature of space is considered in this paper . the integration measure for the contraction of indices is defined by @xmath26 . as in , throughout this paper , the symbol @xmath27 on a tensor is used to represent the solution , which is distinguished from the dynamical variable of a tensor model .",
    "as can be checked easily , the algebra of functions defined by , @xmath28 , is commutative nonassociative , and approaches @xmath29 in the limit @xmath30 .",
    "noting that has the poincare symmetry , and that the products of functions defined by @xmath31 satisfies @xmath32 on a usual continuous space , the fuzzy space defined by for a finite @xmath33 can be regarded as a commutative nonassociative deformation of a usual @xmath22-dimensional flat space .",
    "this fuzzy space is essentially the same one considered in @xcite to investigate the one - loop properties of field theory on nonassociative space .",
    "it is important to note that , because of the identity form of @xmath34 , has a gauge fixed form which can be embedded into a euclidean tensor model .    in the actual computation of contracting indices",
    ", however , the representation of with the indices of the spatial coordinates @xmath35 is inconvenient , because the momentum conservation coming from the translational symmetry of the solution is not obvious .",
    "one may obtain an expression in terms of momentum indices by insertion of the identity , ^d(x - y)=d^dp ( ip(x - y ) ) , to all the contractions of the index @xmath35 .",
    "this is equivalent to the fourier transformation @xmath36 for a lower index of @xmath35 , and its inverse transformation @xmath37 for an upper index . performing this index transformation ,",
    "one obtains the gaussian solutions in the momentum representation as [ eq : cp ] |c_p_1,p_2,p_3&=&a ^d(p_1+p_2+p_3 ) , g^p_1,p_2&=&^d(p_1+p_2 ) , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are positive numerical constants .",
    "the integration measure for the contraction is defined by @xmath40 . since the transformation is not real valued , it is not to take another gauge in a tensor model , but is rather to transform to a technically convenient representation for actual computations .",
    "therefore , on every occasion , one has to take care of how the reality condition is transformed .",
    "on @xmath41 , this is [ eq : cstar ] c_p_1,p_2,p_3=c^*_-p_1,-p_2,-p_3 , where @xmath42 denotes the complex conjugation .    to construct a tensor model with the gaussian solutions ,",
    "i follow the same procedure as was performed in the previous paper @xcite , i.e. constructing first an equation of motion with the gaussian solutions , and defining an action by its square .",
    "the reason behind for this adhoc easy way to define an action comes from the idea that the general relativity can be regarded as low - energy effective phenomena associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the local translational symmetry @xcite . in their discussions , the derivation of the general relativity is based on the analysis of the non - linear realization of the local coordinate transformation rather than starting from an action .",
    "this symmetry breaking is very similar to what occurs in tensor models , that is , the @xmath43 symmetry , the fuzzy analogue of the general coordinate transformation , breaks down at classical solutions @xcite",
    ". therefore one may guess that the essential properties of the low - lying spectra are determined by the symmetry breakdown , but not by the details of an action , although the precise correspondence to the continuum discussions is missing presently .",
    "let me compute the following two tensors , [ eq : bark ] |k_p_1^p_2 & &    [ eq : barh ] |h_p_1,p_2,p_3&&|c_p1,p4^p_5|c_p2,p5^p_6 |c_p_3,p_6^p_4 & = & a^3 ( ) ^ ( -(p_1 ^ 2+p_2 ^ 2+p_3 ^ 2 ) ) ^d(p_1+p_2+p_3 ) . since @xmath44 has a diagonal form , one can safely consider its fractional power is the identity matrix , any fractional power of which remains the same . ] , ( |k^-29)_p_1^p_2= a^-49 ( ) ^- ( 23 p_1 ^ 2 ) ^d(p_1-p_2 ) . therefore the tensor @xmath45 defined by w_p_1,p_2,p_3=c_p_1,p_2,p_3- ( k^-29)_p_1^p_1(k^-29)_p_2^p_2(k^-29)_p_3^p_3 h_p_1,p_2,p_3 vanishes at , if a=()^ , where @xmath46 are defined by omitting @xmath47 in and , [ eq : defk ] k_a^b & & c_acdc^bcd , + [ eq : defh ] h_abc & & c_ad^e c_be^f c_cf^d , respectively .",
    "thus i consider [ eq : generaleq ] w_abc=0 as the equation of motion in this paper .",
    "it should be noted that the equation of motion contains the gaussian solutions irrespective of the dimension @xmath22 , and is therefore giving a kind of unified description to all the gaussian solutions .",
    "the simplest action which has as its equation of motion can be given by [ eq : theaction ] s = w_abcw^abc .",
    "it should be noted that the action is semi - positive definite , and if a solution to is found , this is necessarily a stable solution . therefore there will exist no negative spectra of quadratic fluctuations around it .",
    "in the previous paper @xcite , it was numerically shown that the number of the low - lying spectra at each momentum sector around the gaussian solutions representing one- to four - dimensional fuzzy tori agrees with the expectation from the general relativity . for two - dimensional tori",
    ", it was observed that the number of low - lying spectra is three at @xmath48 , and one at the other sectors .",
    "below i will repeat the explanation of the number distribution in the general relativity .",
    "the actual degrees of freedom of metric must be evaluated modulo the general coordinate transformation .",
    "the infinitesimal local coordinate transformation of the metric tensor in tensor models . ] @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a local translation vector .",
    "on a flat torus , the transformation is expressed as [ eq : ggauge ]",
    "g_(p)=i p_v_(p)+i p_v_(p ) in the momentum representation .",
    "since the gauge transformation is null at @xmath48 sector , there remain all the components of the metric tensor as the actual degrees of freedom , the number of which is given by @xmath52 .",
    "on the other hand , at @xmath53 sectors , this must be subtracted by the number of components of @xmath54 , and the number of the actual degrees of freedom becomes @xmath55 . for @xmath56 ,",
    "these numbers are 3 and 1 , respectively , and agree with the numerical results mentioned above .",
    "it is obvious that such comparison of the numbers is not enough to definitely prove the relation between tensor models and general relativity .",
    "therefore the main purpose of this paper is to compare the details of the corresponding modes in tensor models and general relativity . in the followings ,",
    "i will first propose a correspondence between the rank - three tensor of tensor models and the metric tensor in general relativity .",
    "then , in a slow varying approximation , an @xmath43-invariant quadratic measure of tensor models will lead to the dewitt supermetric @xcite with its unique parameter being fixed .",
    "this supermetric will determine the metric fluctuations transverse to the local coordinate transformation .",
    "then these transverse metric fluctuations will determine the profiles of the fluctuation modes of tensor models under the correspondence , which should be compared with the numerical analysis .",
    "a proposal of correspondence between the rank - three tensor and the metric tensor can be obtained by an invariant generalization of the solution , [ eq : correspondence ] c_x_1,x_2,x_3&=&b g(x_1)^14 g(x_2)^14 g(x_3)^14 , g^x_1,x_2&= & ^d(x_1-x_2 ) , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 denotes the distance , but will cause no problems if only small fluctuations from a background are considered as in this paper . ] between the two points @xmath59 , where the infinitesimal length is defined by @xmath60 as usual . the integration measure in contraction of indices",
    "is defined by @xmath26 .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 is redundant in the sense that it can be absorbed into @xmath61 .",
    "but here it is left for the later convenience to represent the order of @xmath61 , namely @xmath62 is kept .",
    "the correspondence is only applicable in the vicinity of the solution , but will be enough to analyze the small fluctuations around it .",
    "the expression respects the invariance under the general coordinate transformation , that is an invariant tensor such as @xmath63 is invariant under the general coordinate transformation .",
    "this is because the distance @xmath58 is invariant from its definition , and the integration over @xmath35 , which appears in the contraction of an index , c_a , b , xc^x , c , d = d^dx , is also invariant .",
    "it is very interesting to see that , since @xmath34 in does not depend on the metric tensor , the general coordinate transformation is realized within euclidean models .",
    "the measure of tensor models which was used in the numerical analysis in the previous paper @xcite and will be used throughout this paper is the quadratic @xmath43-invariant measure , which will shift the parameter of the dewitt supermetric discussed below . ] , [ eq : cmeasure ] ds_c^2=c_abc c^abc .",
    "the corresponding measure in the space of @xmath49 can be obtained by putting the correspondence into .    by using an identity @xmath64 , the shift of @xmath65 under an infinitesimal shift of the metric @xmath66",
    "is given by [ eq : dc ] c_x_1,x_2,x_3&=&c_x_1,x_2,x_3 .",
    "putting into , one obtains ds_g^2&=&b^2",
    "d^dx_1d^dx_2d^dx_3 ^2 & & ( -2 ( d(x_1,x_2)^2+d(x_2,x_3)^2+d(x_3,x_1)^2 ) ) .",
    "because of the last exponential damping factor , the integration over @xmath67 is dominated by the region within the distance of order @xmath68 from @xmath69 .",
    "therefore if @xmath49 varies so slowly that the variation can be neglected in the length scale @xmath68 , the values of @xmath49 in the integrand can be well approximated by @xmath70 .",
    "this approximation will be available for the analysis of the low - momentum modes around a flat background , and the systematic improvement of this approximation could be obtained by derivative corrections with the expansion parameter @xmath68 .",
    "thus one obtains the corresponding metric in the space of @xmath49 in this slow varying approximation as [ eq : dsslow1 ] ds^2_slow&= & b^2 d^dx_1d^dx_2d^dx_3 g(x_1)^32&&.5cm^2&&.5cm(-2 ( d(x_1-x_2)^2+d(x_2-x_3)^2+d(x_3-x_1)^2 ) ) , where @xmath71 is the distance defined with the metric @xmath70 , d(x)^2g_(x_1 ) x^x^. after expanding the square in the second line of and rewriting , one obtains [ eq : ds2slow ] ds^2_slow&= & b^2 d^dx_1d^dx_2d^dx_3 g(x_1)^32&&.5cm&&.5cm(-2 ( d(x_2)^2+d(x_2-x_3)^2+d(x_3)^2 ) ) & = & 16 s_0 d^dx g(x)^32 g(x)^-1&= & s_0 d^dx . here , from the first to the second equations ,",
    "the gaussian integration over @xmath67 has been performed and a numerical factor has been incorporated into a new numerical coefficient @xmath72 , and from the second to the last equations , i have used g&=&g g^ , g^&=&-g^g^. thus the final expression of @xmath73 has the form of the dewitt supermetric @xcite , and its parameter has been fixed .      in this subsection ,",
    "i restrict the discussions to the small fluctuations around the @xmath56 flat background @xmath74 .",
    "i will first obtain the mode of the metric tensor transverse to the gauge directions , and will then use the correspondence to obtain the corresponding mode in the tensor model .    since the gauge transformation vanishes for a vanishing momentum ,",
    "all the components of the metric tensor survive at the zero - momentum sector . as for a non - vanishing momentum ,",
    "it is enough to consider the momentum @xmath75 , because of the rotational symmetry of the flat background",
    ". then the infinitesimal gauge transformation is given by [ eq : gaugedim2 ] g_11&= & 2i p^1 v_1,g_22&= & 0 , + g_12&= & i p^1 v_2 .",
    "on the other hand , from , the explicit form of the dewitt supermetric in @xmath56 is given by [ eq : explicitdewit ] ds^2_slow = s_0 d^2x   ( g_11,g_22,g_12 ) (    ccc 5 & 1 & 0 + 1 & 5 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 8    ) (    c g_11 + g_22 + g_12    )",
    ". therefore the mode transverse to the gauge transformation is given by (    c g_11 + g_22 + g_12    ) (    ccc 5 & 1 & 0 + 1 & 5 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 8    ) ^-1 (    c 0 + 1 + 0    ) = (    c -1 + 5 + 0    ) .",
    "thus the transverse mode is characterized by [ eq : tranmode ] & = & -15,&=&0 .",
    "the corresponding transverse mode in the tensor model can be obtained by putting into the correspondence .",
    "one may directly compare the obtained mode with the low - lying modes from the numerical analysis .",

    "since the @xmath43 symmetry is an essential ingredient of tensor models and it is hard to control its breaking , the function @xmath1 must keep the invariance .",
    "one of the simplest choices of such @xmath1 is given by the @xmath139 in , [ eq : renc ] c^(r)_abc = r(c^(r-1))_abc = c^(r-1)_ad^e c^(r-1)_be^f c^(r-1)_cf^d .    to check that this is a kind of coarse graining process ,",

    "the problem i consider in this subsection is the overlapping of the  heavy \" modes on the low - lying modes encountered at the @xmath146 sector in the @xmath114 spectra as in figure  [ fig : specl5 ] . for this small size of @xmath102 ,",
    "it is difficult to judge whether the overlapping  heavy \" modes are relevant in the large @xmath102 limit or not . in general",

    "in the previous paper @xcite , the number distribution of the low - lying states around the gaussian solutions representing one- to four - dimensional fuzzy flat tori in a tensor model was studied , and was shown to agree with the number distribution of the metric fluctuation modes transverse to the general coordinate transformation in the general relativity .",
    "although the agreement of the numbers for various dimensional tori is non - trivial , it is certainly not enough for a definite conclusion . a disadvantage in the previous numerical study was the complexity of the action , which made it difficult to go beyond the number counting",

    "this kind of simplifications will be expected to occur much more in quantum mechanics and in thermodynamics , since quantum and thermodynamical fluctuations generally average over detailed classical structures . moreover , as shown in , the gaussian solutions are right on the renormalization trajectories .",
