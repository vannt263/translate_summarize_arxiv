    "the standard model ( sm ) based on @xmath4 is confirmed at quantum level with high accuracy .",
    "still the sm has to be extended in order to accommodate the following observations : ( @xmath5 ) neutrino masses and mixings , ( @xmath6 ) baryogenesis , ( @xmath7 ) nonbaryonic cold dark matter of the universe , and ( @xmath8 ) inflation and density perturbation .    for the 1st and the 2nd items ,",
    "the most economic and aesthetically attractive idea is to introduce singlet right - handed neutrinos and the seesaw mechanism , and leptogenesis for baryon number asymmetry . for the 3rd item",
    ", there are many models for cold dark matter , from axion to lightest superparticles to hidden sector dms , to name a few . for the 4th item",
    "the simplest inflation model without new inflaton fields would be @xmath9 inflation by starobinsky  @xcite and higgs inflation  @xcite .",
    "in nonsupersymmetric dark matter models , one often assumes ad hoc @xmath10 symmetry in order to stabilize dm , without deeper understanding of its origin or asking if it is global or local discrete symmetry .",
    "if we assume that global symmetry is not protected by quantum gravity effects , this @xmath10 symmetry would be broken by @xmath11 suppressed nonrenormalizable operators  @xcite .",
    "then the electroweak scale dm can not live long enough to be dark matter candidate of the universe .",
    "the simplest way to guarantee the stability of ew scale dm is to assume the dm carries its own gauge charge which is absolutely conserved .",
    "thus we are led to local dark symmetry and dark gauge force .",
    "this would be a very natural route for the dm model building , since the unsurpassed successful sm is also based on local gauge symmetry and its spontaneous breaking .",
    "if weak scale dm carried nonzero sm gauge charges , it would be strongly constrained by direct detection cross section as well as electroweak precision observables and flavor physics .",
    "therefore we assume the dm is neutral under the sm gauge interaction , and making a hidden sector .",
    "a hidden sector is generic in many models beyond the sm , including susy models or superstring theories .",
    "for example , high rank gauge group in the string theory would eventually break down to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is nothing but the dark gauge symmetry acting on hidden sector dark matter .",
    "if @xmath13 is unbroken , dm particles would be absolutely stable , like the electron is absolutely stable due to electric charge conservation .",
    "if dark gauge coupling is strong and dark gauge interaction is confining like ordinary qcd , the dm would be the lightest composite hadrons in the hidden sector . in this case",
    "it is possible to generate all the mass scales of the sm particles as well as the dm mass from dimensional transmutation in the hidden sector strong interaction  @xcite .",
    "if dark gauge coupling is weak , we can employ the standard perturbation method to analyze the problems , which we adopt in the model described in this talk .",
    "another guiding principle is renormalizability of the model .",
    "the present authors found that one would get erroneous results if the effective lagrangian approach is used for singlet fermion or vector dm with higgs portal  @xcite .",
    "finally we generalize the notion of higgs portal to the singlet portal , assuming that the singlet operators in the standard seesaw model make portals to the dark sector .",
    "note that there are only 3 singlet operators : @xmath14 and the kinetic mixing between @xmath3 and @xmath15 field strength tensors .    in this talk ,",
    "i present a simple renormalizable model where the dark matter lives in a dark ( hidden ) sector with its own dark gauge charge along with dark gauge force .",
    "we mainly discuss the unbroken @xmath3 dark gauge symmetry , and briefly mention what happens if @xmath3 is spontanesouly broken .",
    "this talk is based on ref .",
    "@xcite , to which we invite the readers for more detailed discussions on the subjects described in this talk .",
    "as explained in introduction , we assume that dark matter lives in a hidden sector , and it is stable due to unbroken local @xmath3 dark gauge symmetry .",
    "all the sm fields are taken to be @xmath3 singlets .",
    "assuming that the rh neutrinos are portals to the hidden sector , we need both a scalar ( @xmath2 ) and a dirac fermion ( @xmath16 ) with the same nonzero dark charge",
    ". then the composite operator @xmath17 becomes a gauge singlet and thus can couple to the rh neutrinos @xmath18 s . and",
    "@xmath2 in the dark sector .",
    "this case is discussed in brief in sec .  3 , table  1 . ]    with these assumptions , we can write the most general renormalizable lagrangian as follows : [ lagrangian ] = _ sm + _ x + _ + _ portal + _ inflation where @xmath19 is the standard model lagrangian and [ lx ] _ x & = & |  ( _ + i g_x q_x ",

    "we assume @xmath26 , so that the local @xmath3 remains unbroken and the scalar potential is bounded from below at tree level .",
    "this model has only 3 more fields compared to the standard seesaw models , and is based on local gauge principle for absolutely stable dm rather than ad hoc @xmath10 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "therefore , our model could be considered as an alternative to the so - called new minimal sm  @xcite .",
    "our model is simple enough , but has sufficiently rich structures , and it can accommodate various observations from cosmology and astrophysics with definite predictions for higgs physics :    * dark scalar @xmath2 can improve the stability of the electroweak vacuum up to planck scale , unlike the sm for @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 , if @xmath30 and @xmath31 . *",
    "perturbativity of quartic couplings for scalar fields @xmath32 and @xmath2 up to planck scale puts theoretical constraints on @xmath33 and @xmath34 such that @xmath35 and @xmath36 . *",
    "massless dark photon mediates long range between dark matter , and can solve the small scale problem of dm subhalo while satisfying constraints from inner structure and kinematics of dark matter halos , if @xmath37 . *",
    "if dark fermion @xmath16 were lighter than @xmath2 and became dm , then its thermal relic density would be too large since it can annihilate only into a pair of dark photon ( @xmath38 ) . on the contrary the dark scalar @xmath2",
    "can be diluted efficiently even if @xmath20 is very small , since there is a higgs portal term which makes @xmath39 ( sm particles ) .",
    "* direct detection experiments such as xenon100 and cdms put strong bounds on the combination of the gauge kinetic mixing @xmath40 for @xmath41 when the upper bound on @xmath20 is used .",
    "* massless dark photon in our model would contribute to the number of effective neutrinos which can be measured accurately by planck satellite and others .",
    "we find that dark photon contributes to dark radiation by @xmath0 , which is in agreement with the recent planck data , @xmath42 at @xmath43 cl .",
    "* the decay of right - handed(rh ) neutrinos generate both matter and dark matter thanks to see - saw mechanism",
    ". however the asymmetric component of dark matter disappears as the heavy dark fermion @xmath16 decays eventually , that can also generate visible sector lepton number asymmetry large enough to match the observation .",
    "* higgs inflation can work in our model since the gauge singlet scalar coupled to sm higgs field cures the instability of potential in higgs - singlet system .",
    "inflation along the sm higgs direction does not pose any new constraint on the model parameters .",
    "* in case @xmath3 is unbroken , the higgs signal strength should be equal to `` 1 '' , independent of production and decay channels .",
    "if we consider other variations of the model with broken @xmath3 or only dark scalar or dark fermion , the number of higgs - like scalar bosons can be more than one , with universally reduced higgs signal strength ( see table  1 ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we presented a simple extension of the standard seesaw model where dark matter physics is constructed with local dark gauge symmetry .",
