    "in this paper , we consider the problem of approximating a catenoid , which is a minimal surface , using odd truncated cones in such a manner that maintains _ minimality _ in a certain sense . from this surface",
    ", we also obtain an approximation of a catenary in the form of a polyline that retains what we regard to be the most important property of the catenrary .    as a real - world illustration of the problem we consider , suppose we wish to form a surface from a rubber membrane .",
    "we can consider such a surface to be `` stable '' if it is difficult to deform , i.e. , if it resists compression and tension .",
    "only minimal surfaces are stable in this sense .",
    "for this reason , the study of minimal surfaces is important for industrial applications . now , suppose that instead of a rubber membrane , we wish to construct a surface from plane figures . this is a common situation in industrial applications .",
    "a truncated cone can be constructed from plane figures , and thus , for such applications , it would be useful to develop methods for approximating surfaces of various types using truncated cones .",
    "further , if we could construct surfaces that approximate minimal surfaces in such a manner that maintains _ minimality _ , they would be of great practical usefulness . formulating such a method for constructing approximations of surfaces from truncated cones would also be important mathematically , because taking the limit of an infinite number of truncated cones , we could obtain the parametric equations of various surfaces of interest .",
    "in this work , we approach the problem of approximating a catenoid by considering approximations of the corresponding catenary .",
    "more precisely , we consider polylines forming discrete curves that converge to the catenary .",
    "further , we choose these polylines in such a way that the surfaces of revolution they generate are themselves _",
    "minimal_. because such a polyline represents a discretization of a catenary , the problem we consider is also useful from a mathematical point of view . the function @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "theorem 2.4 ) used to construct these polylines ( cf .",
    "( 2.2 ) ) has two noteworthy characteristics : it is a rational function over the rational number field q for any @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and it has a closed - form expression .",
    "it is interesting that we can approximate a catenary with polylines obtained using such functions .",
    "a catenary is the curve assumed by a hanging chain .",
    "its form is given by the function @xmath3 for a constant @xmath4 .",
    "the surface of revolution generated by rotating a catenary @xmath5 about the @xmath6-axis is called a catenoid . here , such a surface is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the catenoid has the following special property : every non - planar rotationally symmetric minimal surface is congruous to a piece of a catenoid ( cf .",
    "3.5.1 in [ 2 ] ) . here ,",
    "the term `` minimal '' means  of mean curvature zero . \" now , we consider catenoids @xmath8 , generated by catenaries satisfying @xmath9 $ ] , whose boundaries consist of two circles of radii @xmath10 . if we choose @xmath10 to be sufficiently large , then there are two such catenoids , generated by catenaries whose values of @xmath11 we write @xmath12 , where we choose @xmath13",
    "it is known that the area of @xmath14 is invariant with respect to infinitesimal perturbations of the surface that keep the boundaries fixed .",
    "the same holds for @xmath15 ( cf .",
    "theorem 1 in 2.1 of [ 2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , it is known that the area of @xmath14 is minimal among the set of surfaces possessing the same boundaries , while that of @xmath15 is not .",
    "below , we consider discretizations of @xmath16 .",
    "we call a cone whose apex is cut off by a plane parallel to its base a truncated cone . for @xmath17 and @xmath18 , let @xmath19 be the truncated cone whose circular edges have radii @xmath20 and @xmath21 and whose height is @xmath22 . here",
    ", we do not consider the regions interior to the two circles of radii @xmath20 and @xmath21 to be part of @xmath19 . defining @xmath23 we see that the area of @xmath19 is equal to @xmath24 . for @xmath25 and @xmath18 , let @xmath26 be the figure consisting of the union of @xmath19 and @xmath27 attached along the circle of radius @xmath21 .",
    "we define @xmath28 @xmath29 for @xmath30 similarly .",
    "the surface @xmath31 is called a _ piecewise truncated conical surface _ with length @xmath32 , or simply a ptc surface with l-@xmath32 .",
    "note that the boundary of @xmath31 consists of two circles of radii @xmath20 and @xmath33 , and its area is given by @xmath34 next , we define @xmath35 for arbitrary fixed @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 is called a ptc surface with boundary condition @xmath39 and length @xmath40 , or simply bcl-@xmath41 . a ptc surface",
    "@xmath42 with bcl-@xmath41 is said to be _ minimal _ if @xmath43 is a critical point of the function @xmath44 moreover , a ptc minimal surface @xmath42 with bcl-@xmath41 is said to be _ stable _ if and only if the hessian matrix of the above function is positive definite at @xmath43 .    studying a symmetric ptc surface @xmath45 @xmath46 with bcl-@xmath47 ,",
    "the following questions come to mind :     + 1 .",
    "where does this surface become minimal ?",
    "+ 2 . where does this surface become stable ?",
    "we answered these questions in [ 3 ] .",
    "the answer to the first is the following :    ( cf . theorem 1 in [ 3 ] ) + for @xmath48 and @xmath49 , there exist an explicit function @xmath50 on @xmath51 and @xmath52 such that for any @xmath53 , the following holds :    ( 1 ) : :    if @xmath54 , then the equation    @xmath55 has two positive solutions    @xmath56 with    @xmath57 .",
    "( 2 ) : :    @xmath45    @xmath46 with    @xmath58 for    @xmath59 are ptc minimal surfaces .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a chebyshev polynomial of the first kind , and @xmath62 is the gauss hypergeometric series .",
    "the answer to the second question is the following :    ( cf .",
    "theorem 2 in [ 3 ] ) under the same conditions as in answer 2.2 , @xmath45 @xmath46 with @xmath63 for @xmath59 is stable .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the same questions for another symmetric ptc surface , namely @xmath64 with bcl-@xmath65 .",
    "a calculation provides the following answer to the first question :    for @xmath48 and @xmath49 , there exist an explicit function @xmath66 on @xmath67 and @xmath68 such that for any @xmath53 , the following holds :    ( 1 ) : :    if @xmath69 , then the equation    @xmath70 has two positive solutions    @xmath71 with    @xmath72 . ( 2 ) : :    @xmath64    with @xmath73 for    @xmath59 are ptc minimal surfaces .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a chebyshev polynomial of the third kind .",
    "the answer to the second question is    under the same conditions as in theorem 2.4 , @xmath76 @xmath77 with @xmath78 for @xmath59 is stable .",
    "now , the ptc minimal surfaces considered in answer 2.2 with @xmath79 are denoted by @xmath80 , and those considered in theorem 2.4 with @xmath81 are denoted by @xmath82 . from the fact that the areas of @xmath83 and @xmath84 are both invariant with respect to infinitesimal perturbation , answers 2.2 and 2.3 and theorems 2.4 and 2.5 , we find that as @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 tend to @xmath83 , while @xmath88 and @xmath89 tend to @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , we can regard the polylines whose vertices are specified by the sequence @xmath90 and @xmath91 as _ good _ approximations of the catenaries on @xmath92 $ ] with boundary @xmath10 .",
    "we prove theorem 2.4 in  3 and theorem 2.5 in  4 . in  5 , by investigating specific catenaries , we determine the precision of the approximations of the catenary provided by the above polylines .",
    "we showed that @xmath80 and @xmath82 , respectively , tend to a catenoid by using the fact that the areas of @xmath93 are both invariant with respect to infinitesimal perturbation .",
    "however , we can demonstrate the same thing without using this fact , since we have obtained @xmath94 and + @xmath95 @xmath96 explicitly .",
    "indeed , writing @xmath97 , we have @xmath98 moreover , we know that @xmath99 and @xmath100 tend to @xmath101 and @xmath102 as @xmath85 , respectively , because we have @xmath103 in this way , by constructing ptc minimal surfaces , we can obtain the parametric equations of the corresponding minimal surfaces .",
    "the same is true in the case of @xmath104 .",
    "we denote @xmath105 by @xmath106 for simplicity . recall that @xmath107 putting @xmath108 the area of @xmath64 is expressed as @xmath109 @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , we only have to evaluate @xmath110 for investigating minimality and stability of this ptc surface .    in this section ,",
    "we prove theorem 2.4 .      for @xmath112 and @xmath18 , we consider the critical points of the function @xmath113 @xmath114 .",
    "note that @xmath115 thus , if @xmath116 is a critical point of @xmath117 , then @xmath118 therefore , we have @xmath119 because @xmath120 does not satisfy ( 3.1 ) , we obtain @xmath121 if @xmath122 in ( 3.2 ) , then @xmath10 is a negative number .",
    "therefore , we regard the right - hand side of ( 3.2 ) as a function on @xmath123 , and denote this function by @xmath124 , that is , @xmath125 since the second derivative of @xmath124 is @xmath126 this funtion is positive and convex on @xmath123 .",
    "moreover , because @xmath127 @xmath124 takes the unique minimal value @xmath128 at a point @xmath129 . hence ,",
    "if @xmath130 , then there are the two solutions @xmath131 of @xmath132 , where @xmath133",
    ". therefore , @xmath131 are the critical points of the function @xmath117 . namely , @xmath134 are minimal .      for @xmath112 and @xmath18",
    ", we consider the critical points of the function @xmath136 @xmath137 @xmath138 , that is , we consider a point @xmath139 satisfying @xmath140 from the formula @xmath141 we see that @xmath142 .",
    "moreover , @xmath143 implies that @xmath144 here , if @xmath145 , then formula ( 3.3 ) does not hold and so we have @xmath146 that is , @xmath147 if we put @xmath148 then @xmath149 is positive , convex on @xmath150 and @xmath151 thus , @xmath149 takes the unique minimal value @xmath152 at a point @xmath153 .",
    "hence , if @xmath154 , then there are the two solutions @xmath155 of @xmath156 , where @xmath157 .",
    "consequently , if @xmath154 , there are the two critical points @xmath158 of @xmath159 .",
    "namely , if @xmath154 , then @xmath160 are minimal .",
    "we consider the critical points of @xmath162 for @xmath112 and @xmath18 . if @xmath163 is a critical point of @xmath164 , then as in the case @xmath135 , we have @xmath165 and @xmath166 putting @xmath167 similarly as in the case @xmath135",
    ", we see that there is @xmath168 with @xmath169 such that if @xmath170 , then the equation @xmath171 has the two solutions @xmath172 with @xmath173 . consequently , if @xmath174 , then @xmath175 are the critical points of @xmath176 .    repeating the above argument",
    ", we see that @xmath66 is defined as @xmath177 for @xmath178 and @xmath179 from formulas ( 3.4 ) , ( 3.5 ) , ( 3.7 ) and ( 3.8 ) , we can anticipate that @xmath66 is expressed as , for @xmath180 , @xmath181 where @xmath182 is called the gauss hypergeometric series and is defined as @xmath183 and @xmath184 , and so on . indeed , we prove this formula ( 3.9 ) in the next subsection .      in this subsection , we prove that @xmath66 is expressed as ( 3.9 ) for @xmath180 .",
    "it is obvious that ( 3.9 ) with @xmath185 and @xmath186 are equal to ( 3.7 ) and ( 3.8 ) , respectively .",
    "therefore , we have only to show that formula ( 3.9 ) satisfies ( 3.6 ) when @xmath178 .    the jacobi polynomial @xmath187 is expressed as @xmath188 in terms of the gauss hypergeometric series(cf .",
    "15.4.6 in [ 1 ] ) .",
    "hence , by this relation , we see that the right hand side of ( 3.9 ) is equal to @xmath189 in addition , by using the third kind chebyshev polynomial @xmath190 which is expressed as @xmath191 ( cf .",
    "1.2.3 in [ 4 ] ) , we see that ( 3.10 ) can be expressed as @xmath192 consequently , we found that the right hand side of ( 3.9 ) is rewritten in terms of the third kind chebyshev polynomial and denote this by @xmath193 , that is , @xmath194",
    "so , it suffices to prove that @xmath193 satisfies the same formula as ( 3.6 ) when @xmath178 .",
    "we remark that the third kind chebyshev polynomial satisfies the following relation : @xmath195 where @xmath196(cf .",
    "1.2.3(1.12a ) in [ 4 ] ) .",
    "then , we see that @xmath197 for @xmath178 . formula ( 3.13 ) is showed in the same way as lemma 1 in [ 3 ] .    rearranging ( 3.6 ) , we see that the formula we should show is @xmath198 substituting ( 3.11 ) for each @xmath199 ) in the left hand side of ( 3.14 ) , and using ( 3.12 ) and ( 3.13 ) , we see that the left hand side of ( 3.14 ) is equal to zero . consequently , we have @xmath200 moreover , because @xmath201 ( cf .",
    "15.1.12 ) , we obtain @xmath202      in this subsection , we prove theorem 2.4 . because @xmath203 we have @xmath204 therefore , @xmath66 is positive and convex on @xmath150 , and @xmath205 hence , there is a unique zero point @xmath206 of @xmath207 .",
    "moreover , if we put @xmath208 , then @xmath209 is the minimum of @xmath66 .",
    "the role of @xmath209 and @xmath210 of @xmath76 @xmath211 @xmath212 with @xmath73 for @xmath59 are obtained similarly as in the case @xmath213 .",
    "we saw that @xmath66 is positive and convex on @xmath150 in the above .",
    "we consider other properties of @xmath66 .    from ( 3.15 ) , we have @xmath214 for @xmath180 .",
    "in addition , because @xmath215 we have @xmath216 for @xmath180 .",
    "therefore , we obtain    @xmath217 and @xmath218 for @xmath180 . in particular , if @xmath219 at a point @xmath220 , then @xmath221 for @xmath222 .",
    "in this section , we prove theorem 2.5 . for this , we investigate whether @xmath223 @xmath224 @xmath225 @xmath77 with @xmath73 for @xmath59 + are stable .",
    "we denote @xmath106 by @xmath226 for simplicity .",

    "we consider the determinant of @xmath251 for @xmath256 .",
    "note that each @xmath257 satisfies the following recurrence relation : @xmath258 for @xmath259 . in this subsection , we prove    @xmath260 for @xmath256 .",
    "we remark that @xmath251 does not have @xmath261 as its element . here , we take @xmath261 as @xmath262    we prove this lemma by induction .",
    "first , we consider in the case that @xmath111 . because @xmath263 from ( 4.1 ) , we have @xmath264 observing that @xmath265 we obtain lemma 4.2 in the case that @xmath111 .",
    "second , we consider in the case that @xmath135 . since @xmath266 we have @xmath267 and consequently @xmath268 from the case @xmath111 .",
    "finally , we assume that this lemma holds for @xmath269 .",
