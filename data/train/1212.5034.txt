    "<S> @xcite studied a lattice of ring resonators , similar to a 2d version of the crow ( coupled resonator optical waveguide ) @xcite , in which the direction of propagation of light within each resonator acts as a two - fold `` spin '' degree of freedom . in the tight - binding ( weak - coupling ) regime , coupling waveguides can be used to implement spin - conserving hopping between adjacent resonator modes , and phase shifts in these couplers give rise to an effective vector potential in the tight - binding hopping amplitudes , with opposite signs for the two spins . with a choice of phase shifts implementing the landau gauge ( which is aperiodic in the lattice ) , the effective magnetic field can be made uniform and non - zero , which yields a photonic analog of the integer quantum hall effect in each spin sector , with a hofstadter butterfly spectrum @xcite and topologically protected edge states . </S>",

    "<S> _  suggested that the edge states can serve as robust optical delay lines @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the spin - dependent magnetic field in this system is reminiscent of the topological insulator model of kane and mele @xcite , which has attracted major theoretical and experimental interest @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is one major difference : the couplings in the kane - mele model have the periodicity of the lattice , and decoupling the two spin sectors reduces the model to two zero - field quantum hall systems @xcite , with zero net magnetic flux through each unit cell . in the system of hafezi _ et al . </S>",

    "<S> when the inter - resonator couplings are tuned to large values beyond the tight - binding regime , the system exhibits one - way edge states , with non - zero @xmath0 topological invariant @xcite ; if the two spin sectors are decoupled , each acts as a zero - field system , like the kane - mele model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the system therefore behaves as a photonic topological insulator . </S>",
    "<S> previously , khanikaev _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have proposed a different photonic topological insulator , which also does not require aperiodic couplings , using linear combinations of polarization states as the spin analog . however , that system relies on the special properties of metamaterials , whereas the present one uses ordinary dielectric materials and is thus considerably more feasible .    </S>",
    "<S> our calculations rely on the transfer matrix method , which has previously been applied to the crow @xcite , and has a wider domain of validity for such systems than the tight - binding method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this method also lets us easily study the effects of gain and loss , which can produce behaviors not easily obtainable in electronic topological insulators . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the pt ( parity / time - reversal ) symmetric lattice @xcite , which contains balanced amounts of gain and loss . </S>",
