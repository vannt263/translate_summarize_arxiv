    "globular clusters are very efficient places to produce x - ray binaries via dynamical interactions . in particular",
    ", it has been known for many years that the formation rate per unit mass of luminous ( @xmath1 ) x - ray sources is much higher in globular clusters than that of the rest of our galaxy .",
    "more recently , similar results are found in other nearby spiral galaxies like m31 ( distefano et al .",
    "2002 ) and m104 ( distefano et al . 2003 ) . among all extragalactic globular clusters ,",
    "g1 in m31 is an intriguing one . with a luminosity of @xmath2 ( rich et al .",
    "1996 ) , it is the most luminous star cluster in the local group , and also one of the most massive , at @xmath3 ( meylan et al .",
    "2001 ) . the rates at which x - ray binaries are created in the cluster core are therefore expected to be high compared with globular clusters in the milky way .",
    "furthermore , it has been claimed , based on kinematic studies , that g1 hosts a @xmath4 intermediate - mass black hole ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2002,2005 ) .",
    "however , this result is controversial and has been challenged by baumgardt et al .",
    "x - ray observations of g1 therefore allow us to investigate some of the interesting properties of the cluster .    recently , _",
    "xmm - newton _ has conducted three short ( @xmath5 10 ksec ) observations of g1 and has discovered an x - ray source coincident with g1 ( trudolyubov & priedhorsky 2004 ; pooley & rappaport 2006 ) .",
    "to explain the origin of the x - ray emission of g1 , pooley & rappaport ( 2006 ) proposed that it could be due to accretion of ionized cluster gas by a central intermediate - mass black hole or it could be produced by a conventional x - ray binary , and it is also possible to distinguish these two scenarios by obtaining a precise localization of the x - ray emission . if the x - ray emission is due to a central 20,000 @xmath6 black hole , we expect it comes from within 50 mas of the center .",
    "however , if low - mass x - ray binaries are responsible to the x - ray emission , then we expect the x - ray emission offsets from the core .",
    "this requires high - resolution x - ray observations . however , there is no _ chandra _",
    "observation of g1 and only _ xmm - newton _  observations are available .",
    "although pooley & rappaport ( 2006 ) investigated the _ xmm - newton _  spectra of g1 in detail , they did not perform an astrometric study .",
    "the absolute astrometry of _ xmm - newton _  is about @xmath7 ( kirsch 2006 ) while the statistical uncertainty is intensity dependent .",
    "this leads to a positional error of about @xmath8 depending on the source brightness .",
    "while the spatial resolution of _ xmm - newton _ is much poorer than _ chandra _ it is possible to localize x - ray positions to @xmath9 with _ xmm - newton _  if one calibrates the astrometry carefully . in this paper",
    ", we refined the x - ray position of g1 by performing precise relative astrometry using _ xmm - newton _  and the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "g1 was first observed with the _ xmm - newton _  in 2001 january for a total exposure time of @xmath10 ksec .",
    "there were two more _ xmm - newton _  observations in 2002 december and 2003 february .",
    "both observations were off - axis resulting heavy vignetting and one of the observations was affected by high background [ see pooley & rappaport ( 2006 ) for a summary ] . in this letter",
    ", we only consider the first observation taken in 2001 .",
    "all three cameras ( one pn camera and two mos cameras ) of the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) were turned on for collecting data .",
    "all the x - ray data were processed with the _ xmm - newton _  science analysis system ( sas ) version 7.0 .",
    "we downloaded the raw data from the _ xmm - newton _  archive and reprocessed with sas together with the latest calibration products .",
    "the reprocessed event lists were first examined for background variation using the high energy ( 1015 kev ) background lightcurves and we did not find any significant background flaring event .",
    "we extracted x - ray images with photon energies in the range of 0.310 kev , and only considered events with flag = 0 and single and double events for the pn camera ( pattern @xmath11 ) , and single to quadruple events for the mos cameras ( pattern @xmath12 ) .",
    "source detection was then performed using a maximum likelihood approach as implemented by the sas tools _",
    "edetect_chain_. we ran the source detection simultaneously on the data from all three cameras .",
    "g1 was clearly detected and was seen in all three cameras with a combined detection likelihood of 63 .",
    "we compared the x - ray source list with the 2mass and usno catalogs and images , and looked for coincidence of bright and isolated stellar objects .",
    "we found one star ( 2mass00325251 + 3931424 ) that is @xmath13 from the x - ray position and it is likely to be a foreground star .    to verify the nature of this x - ray emitting stellar object , we computed the hardness ratios .",
    "these ratios were based on the source counts in the three energy bands : @xmath14 ( 0.31 kev ) , @xmath15 ( 12 kev ) , and @xmath16 ( 2 - 10 kev ) .",
    "the two hardness ratios are defined as hr1=@xmath17 and hr2=@xmath18 .",
    "figure 1 shows the color - color diagram of the x - ray emitting foreground star and g1 .",
    "we have overlaid the color - color diagram with lines showing the tracks followed by representative spectra with differing values of @xmath19 .",
    "the x - ray colors of the x - ray emitting star indicate that it has a very soft x - ray spectrum , consistent with a very soft x - ray source ( distefano & kong 2004 ) .",
    "the x - ray radiation is therefore likely due to the coronal emission from a foreground star .",
    "the star has a @xmath20 magnitude of 14.0 ( monet et al .",
    "we calculated the x - ray to optical flux ratio as @xmath21 ( hornschemeier et al .",
    "2001 ) . with a count rate of 0.018 c / s in the pn detector and assuming a raymond - smith model with @xmath22 kev and @xmath23 @xmath24 ,",
    "the 0.310 kev flux is @xmath25and the corresponding @xmath26 is 0.005 , typical for a foreground star ( hornschemeier et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "based on the optical counterpart , the boresight correction that needs to be applied to the x - ray source positions is @xmath27 in r.a . and @xmath28 in decl . ; the uncertainties are quadratic sum of the positional errors of the x - ray and 2mass source .",
    "the correction is consistent with the absolute pointing accuracy of _ xmm - newton _  ( see also an example in pietsch , freyberg & haberl 2005 ) .      g1 was observed with the _ hst _",
    "advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in high resolution channel ( hrc ) mode on 2003 october 24 .",
    "the total integration time is 41 minutes in the f555w filter centering on g1 .",
    "we used the _ hst _",
    "pipeline data that were shifted and co - added using the multidrizzle package in pyraf , with masking of cosmic rays , saturated pixels , and bad pixels .",
    "we calibrated the astrometry of the _ hst _  data by using the 2mass catalog .",
    "the field - of - view of the acs / hrc is small ( @xmath29 ) and only two stars in the field are in the 2mass catalog . by computing the average offset between",
    "the _ hst _  and 2mass stars , we shifted the _",
    "image by @xmath30 in r.a . and",
    "@xmath31 in decl . , with a residual of @xmath32 .",
    "the acs / hrc image of g1 is shown in figure 2 .",
    "g1 was also observed with the _ hst _  wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on 1995 october 2 with a total integration time of 37 minutes in the f555w filter .",
    "in addition to the f555w data , images were also taken in the f814w and f1042 m filters .",
    "we downloaded the f555w image from the wfpc2 associations science products pipeline for which cosmic - ray free , science - quality images are dithered and co - added . since the field - of - view of wfpc2 is much larger than that of acs / hrc , we can correct the astrometry with 6 stars in the 2mass catalog .",
    "we applied the astrometry correction using iraf task _ ccmap _ yielding a residual of @xmath33 .",
    "the wfpc2 f555w image is shown in figure 2 .",
    "after registering the absolute reference frames of the _ hst _  and _ xmm - newton _  images to the 2mass catalog , we located the center of g1 in the _ hst _  images and the x - ray position of g1 .",
    "we determined the centroid of g1 in the acs / hrc image ( r.a.=00h32m46.537s , decl.=+39d34m40.65s with @xmath34 error of @xmath35 ) by computing the intensity weighted mean within the core radius ( @xmath36 ; ma et al . 2007 ) using iraf task _",
    "center_. we also checked the result by using the half - mass radius ( @xmath37 ) and there is no difference except for a larger error bar ( @xmath38 ) . for the x - ray position , we applied the astrometric correction on the value determined by _",
    "edetect_chain _ yielding r.a.=00h32m46.6s , decl.=+39d34m40s .",
    "we then determined the @xmath34 radius error circle ( @xmath0 ) of the _ xmm - newton _  position of g1 by computing the quadratic sum of the positional uncertainty for the x - ray source ( @xmath39 ) , the uncertainty in the optical astrometry ( @xmath32 ) , and the uncertainty in the x - ray boresight correction ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the same procedure was also applied to the wfpc2 image .",
    "figure 2 shows the acs / hrc and wfpc2 images of g1 and the @xmath34 radius x - ray error circles .",
    "the center of g1 derived from the optical image is also marked .",
    "using _ xmm - newton _  and _ hst _ , we determined the centroid of g1 in the optical images as well as the x - ray position of g1 . from figure 2 , although the x - ray position offsets from the cluster core , the cluster center is within the @xmath34 error circle of the x - ray position .",
    "therefore , the current _ xmm - newton _  data can not provide constraint on whether the x - rays of g1 come from bondi accretion of ionized cluster gas by a central intermediate - mass black hole for which the x - rays should come from the central 50 mas of the cluster ( pooley & rappaport 2006 ) .",
    "alternatively , the x - ray emission could be produced by luminous low - mass x - ray binaries and we expect such x - ray emission may be outside the cluster center .",
    "previous x - ray observations of globular clusters suggest that luminous ( @xmath41 ergs s@xmath42 ) x - ray sources tend to locate within the core radius ( grindlay et al .",
    "recent _ chandra _  observations also show that nearly half of the quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries are found within the core radius ( e.g. , grindlay et al . 2002 ; pooley et al .",
    "2002 ; heinke et al .",
    "2003,2006 ) .",
    "therefore , it is likely that a luminous low - mass x - ray binary would locate within the core radius ( @xmath36 ; ma et al . 2007 ) of g1 .",
    "the x - ray emission of g1 could also come from multiple low - mass x - ray binaries and we may be able to resolve g1 as an extended source with high spatial resolution instrument .",
    "pooley & rappaport ( 2006 ) estimated that about 75 low - mass x - ray binaries might be in g1 .",
    "it is worth noting that only one globular cluster , m15 , is known to host two luminous x - ray sources ( white & angelini 2001 ; hannikainen et al .",
    "2005 ) . in conclusion , based on the current _ xmm - newton _  data , we can not distinguish the two possible mechanisms of generating the x - ray emission of g1 .    while the x - ray position of g1 is the most crucial factor to determine its nature ,",
    "pooley & rappaport ( 2006 ) also suggested that the x - ray spectrum may provide some hint .",
    "however , it has been proven that x - ray spectra of intermediate - mass black hole candidates consist of a class of different spectral shapes and in many cases , the spectra can be fit with several models and the estimated mass of the accreting black hole is model dependent ( e.g. stobbart et al .",
    "2006 ; gonalves & soria 2006 ) .",
    "some intermediate - mass black hole candidates also show x - ray spectral change at different luminosity states ( kong & distefano 2005 ) . these make interpretation based on x - ray spectra more difficult .",
    "nevertheless , if we assume a simple accretion disk model for g1 , following pooley & rappaport ( 2006 ) , we would expect g1 has a 10 ev supersoft component ( see distefano & kong 2003 ) ; any emission above 0.5 kev must come from additional components . from the color - color diagram ( figure 1 ) , g1 has significant emission above 1 kev and indeed it is very similar to a typical x - ray binary in m31 with a simple power - law spectral model ( kong et al .",
    "2002 ) . therefore ,",
    "if g1 has a 10 ev supersoft spectrum , it must also have an additional hard component .",
    "indeed , it would be a challenge for _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  to detect such supersoft emission because an absorbed ( galactic value to the direction of m31 ; @xmath43 @xmath24 ) 10 ev spectrum turns over at about 0.2 kev which is the sensitivity limit of these instruments .",
    "for instance , if the x - ray emission is dominated by a 10 ev spectrum , simulation shows that it requires 700 ksec _ xmm - newton _  or 1 msec _",
    "chandra _  observing time in order to detect the source .",
    "if the black hole of g1 is only 100 @xmath44 , the thermal emission would have a temperature of about 80 ev and we should be able to detect it with a 6 ksec _ xmm - newton _  or 10 ksec _ chandra _  observaiton . as a supersoft x - ray source ( @xmath45 ev ) , we do not expect to see x - rays above 1 kev which is not consistent with our current result .",
    "alternatively , if the x - ray emission is from a luminous low - mass x - ray binary , we would also expect soft multi - color disk blackbody x - ray emission ( @xmath46 kev ) in addition to a power - law like component associated with comptonization of cooler photons ( e.g. sidoli et al .",
    "however , with only @xmath47 counts from all three _ xmm - newton _  detectors , we do not have a good constraint on the spectral model . in conclusion ,",
    "x - ray spectra provided by _",
    "xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  alone can not provide convincing evidence for the nature of the x - ray emission from g1 .    although the x - ray position provided by _",
    "xmm - newton _  can not provide any reasonable constraint to the nature of the x - ray emission of g1 , it suggests that future _ chandra _",
    "observations may resolve the problem . as discussed in pooley & rappaport ( 2006 )",
    ", we can improve the relative astrometry of _ chandra _  and _ hst _  to @xmath48 if we can match a few _ chandra _  sources to their optical counterparts ( e.g. foreground stars or background active galactic nuclei ) . with such observations",
    ", we can accurately localize the x - ray emission of g1 .",
    "however , the fact that a luminous low - mass x - ray binary is likely to locate @xmath49 from the cluster core suggests that we may not disentangle from the emission of a possible intermediate - mass black hole .",
    "alternatively , a _",
