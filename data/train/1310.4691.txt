    "<S> in the last years several theoretical papers discussed if time can be an emergent propertiy deriving from quantum correlations . here , to provide an insight into how this phenomenon can occur , we present an experiment that illustrates page and wootters mechanism of `` static '' time , and gambini et al . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent refinements . a static , entangled state between a clock system and the rest of the universe is perceived as evolving by internal observers that test the correlations between the two subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> we implement this mechanism using an entangled state of the polarization of two photons , one of which is used as a clock to gauge the evolution of the second : an `` internal '' observer that becomes correlated with the clock photon sees the other system evolve , while an `` external '' observer that only observes global properties of the two photons can prove it is static .    </S>",
    "<S> .45     the `` problem of time '' @xcite in essence stems from the fact that a canonical quantization of general relativity yields the wheeler - de witt equation @xcite predicting a static state of the universe , contrary to obvious everyday evidence . </S>",
    "<S> a solution was proposed by page and wootters @xcite : thanks to quantum entanglement , a static system may describe an evolving `` universe '' from the point of view of the internal observers . </S>",
    "<S> energy - entanglement between a `` clock '' system and the rest of the universe can yield a stationary state for an ( hypothetical ) external observer that is able to test the entanglement vs. abstract coordinate time . </S>",
    "<S> the same state will be , instead , evolving for internal observers that test the correlations between the clock and the rest @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , time would be an emergent property of subsystems of the universe deriving from their entangled nature : an extremely elegant but controversial idea @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we want to demystify it by showing experimentally that it can be naturally embedded into ( small ) subsystems of the universe , where page and wootters mechanism ( and gambini et al . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent refinements @xcite ) can be easily studied . </S>",
    "<S> we show how a static , entangled state of two photons can be seen as evolving by an observer that uses one of the two photons as a clock to gauge the time - evolution of the other photon . </S>",
    "<S> however , an external observer can show that the global entangled state does not evolve .    </S>",
    "<S> even though it revolutionizes our ideas on time , page and wootters ( paw ) mechanism is quite simple @xcite : they provide a static entangled state @xmath0 whose subsystems evolve according to the schrdinger equation for an observer that uses one of the subsystems as a clock system @xmath1 to gauge the time evolution of the rest @xmath2 . while the division into subsystems is largely arbitrary , the paw model assumes the possibility of neglecting interaction among them writing the hamiltonian of the global system as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are the local terms associated with @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively @xcite . in this framework </S>",
    "<S> the state of the `` universe '' @xmath0 is then identified by enforcing the wheeler - de witt equation @xmath5 , i.e. by requiring @xmath0 to be an eigenstate of @xmath6 for the zero eigenvalue . </S>",
    "<S> the rational of this choice follows from the observation that by projecting @xmath0 on the states @xmath7 of the clock , one gets the vectors     and @xmath8 are the unitary time evolution operators of the clock @xmath1 and of the rest of universe @xmath2 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is the global state of the system which is assumed to be eigenstate with null eigenvalue of the global hamiltonian @xmath9 ( see text).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    @xmath10    that describe a proper evolution of the subsystem @xmath2 under the action of its local hamiltonian @xmath11 , the initial state being @xmath12 ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> f : figu0 ] ) . therefore , despite the fact that globally the system appears to be static , its components exhibits correlations that mimics the presence of a dynamical evolution @xcite . two main flaws of the paw mechanisms have been pointed out @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first is based on the ( reasonable ) skepticism to accept that quantum mechanics may describe a system as large as the universe , together with its internal observers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second has a more practical character and is based on the observation that in the paw model the calculations of transition probabilities and of propagators appears to be problematic  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an attempt to fix the latter issue has been discussed by gambini et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( gppt ) @xcite by extending a proposal by page @xcite and invoking the notion of ` evolving constants ' of rovelli  @xcite ( a brief overview of this approach is given in the appendix ) .    in this work we present an experiment which allows reproducing the basic features of the paw and gppt models . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the paw model is realized by identifying @xmath13 with an entangled state of the vertical @xmath14 and horizontal @xmath15 polarization degree of freedom of two photons in two spatial modes @xmath16 , i.e. ( see following section ) @xmath17 and enforcing the wheeler - de witt equation by taking @xmath18 as local hamiltonians of the system ( @xmath19 being a parameter which defines the time scale of the model ) . for this </S>",
    "<S> purpose rotations of the polarization of the two photons are induced by forcing them to travel through identical birefringent plates as shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> f : schema ] . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to consider a setting where everything can be decoupled from the `` flow of time '' , i.e.  when the photons are traveling outside the plates . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the clock photon is a true ( albeit extremely simple ) clock : its polarization rotation is proportional to the time it spends crossing the plates .    </S>",
    "<S> although extremely simple , our model captures the two , seemingly contradictory , properties of the paw mechanism : the evolution of the subsystems relative to each other , and the staticity of the global system . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by running the experiment in two different modes ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> f : schema]a ) : ( 1 )  an `` observer '' mode , where the experimenter uses the readings of the clock photon to gauge the evolution of the other : by measuring the clock photon polarization he becomes correlated with the subsystems and can determine their evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this mode describes the conventional observers in the paw mechanism : they are , themselves , subsystems of the universe and become entangled with the clock systems so that they see an evolving universe ; ( 2 )  a `` super - observer '' mode , where he carefully avoids measuring the properties of the subsystems of the entangled state , but only global properties : he can then determine that the global system is static . </S>",
    "<S> this mode describes what an ( hypothetical ) observer external to the universe would see by measuring global properties of the state @xmath13 : such an observer has access to abstract coordinate time ( namely , in our experimental implementation he can measure the thickness of the plates ) and he can prove that the global state is static , as it will not evolve even when the thickness of the plates is varied .     and pbs@xmath20 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the blue boxes ( a ) represent different thicknesses of birefringent plates which evolve the photons by rotating their polarization : different thicknesses represent different time evolutions . </S>",
    "<S> the paw mechanism ( a ) is completely independent of the thickness , whereas the gppt mechanism ( b ) allows it to be measured by the experimenter only through the clock photon ( the abstract coordinate time is unaccessible and averaged away ) ; the dashed box ( b ) represents a ( known ) phase delay of the clock photon only ; pbs stands for polarizing beam splitter in the @xmath21 basis ; bs for beam splitter.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in observer mode ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : schema]a , pink box ) the clock is the polarization of a photon . </S>",
    "<S> it is an extremely simple clock : it has a dial with only two values , either @xmath22 ( detector 1 clicked ) corresponding to time @xmath23 , or @xmath24 ( detector 2 clicked ) corresponding to time @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> [ here @xmath26 , where @xmath19 is the polarization rotation rate of the quartz plate , since the polarization is flipped in this time interval . ] </S>",
    "<S> the experimenter also measures the polarization of the first photon with detectors 3 and 4 . </S>",
    "<S> this last measurement can be expressed as a function of time ( he has access to time only through the clock photon ) by considering the correlations between the results from the two photons : the time - dependent probability that the first photon is vertically polarized ( i.e.  that detector 3 fires ) is @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the conditional probability that detector 3 fired , conditioned on detector @xmath30 firing ( experimental results are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : results]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this type of conditioning is typical of every time - dependent measurement : experimenters always condition their results on the value they read on the lab s clock ( the second photon in this case ) . </S>",
    "<S> the experimenter has access only to physical clocks , not to abstract coordinate time @xcite . in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> this restriction is implemented by employing a different phase plate a ( of random thickness unknown to the experimenter ) in every experimental run .    in super - observer mode </S>",
    "<S> ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : schema]a , yellow box ) the experimenter takes the place of a hypothetical observer external to the universe that has access to the abstract coordinate time and tests whether the global state of the universe has any dependence on it . </S>",
    "<S> hence , he must perform a quantum interference experiment that tests the coherence between the different histories ( wavefunction branches ) corresponding to the different measurement outcomes of the internal observers , represented by the which - way information after the polarizing beam splitter pbs@xmath31 . in our setup , this interference is implemented by the beam splitter bs of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : schema]b . </S>",
    "<S> it is basically a quantum erasure experiment @xcite that coherently `` erases '' the results of the time measurements of the internal observer : conditioned on the photon exiting from the right port of the beam splitter , the information on its input port ( i.e.  the outcome of the time measurement ) is coherently erased @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the erasure of the time measurement by the internal observers is necessary to avoid that the external observer ( super - observer ) himself becomes correlated with the clock . </S>",
    "<S> however , the super - observer has access to abstract coordinate time : he knows the thickness of the blue plates , which is precluded to the internal observers , and he can test whether the global state evolves ( experimental results are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : results]b ) .    in addition </S>",
    "<S> , we also test the gppt mechanism showing that our experiment can also account for two - time measurements ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : schema]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> these are implemented by the two polarizing beam splitter pbs@xmath31 and pbs@xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> pbs@xmath31 represents the initial time measurement that determines when the experiment starts : it is a non - demolition measurement obtained by coupling the photon polarization to its propagation direction , while the initialization of the system state is here implemented through the entanglement . pbs@xmath20 together with detectors 1 and 2 represents the final time measurement by determining the final polarization of the photon . between these two time measurements both the system and the clock </S>",
    "<S> evolve freely ( the evolution is implemented by the birefringent plates a ) . in the gppt mechanism , the abstract coordinate time ( the thickness of the quartz plates a ) is unaccessible and must be averaged over @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this restriction is implemented in the experiment by avoiding to take into account the thickness of the blue quartz plates a when extracting the conditional probabilities from the coincidence rates : the rates obtained with different plate thickness are all averaged together . </S>",
    "<S> the formal mapping of the gppt mechanism to our experiment is detailed in the appendix .    as before , </S>",
    "<S> the time dependent probability of finding the system photon vertically polarized is @xmath27 and @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> however , a clock that returns only two possible values ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) is not very useful . to obtain a more interesting clock , the experimenter performs the same conditional probability measurement introducing varying time delays to the clock photon , implemented through quartz plates of variable thickness ( dashed box b in fig .  </S>",
