    "several national metrology institutes ( nmis ) across the world are working hard on redefining one of the seven si base units , the kilogram ( kg ) , in terms of the planck constant @xmath5 , by means of either the watt / joule balance [ 1 - 9 ] or the x - ray crystal density ( xrcd ) method [ 10 ] .",
    "the watt balance , which was proposed by kibble in 1975 [ 11 ] , has been adopted by the majority of nmis .",
    "the national institute of metrology ( nim , china ) is focusing on the joule balance , which can be seen as an alternative realization of the watt balance [ 12 ] .",
    "the unwanted coil motions in the watt / joule balance , e.g. , horizontal and rotational movements , will lower the signal to noise ratio in the measurement . with these motions , the measurement would take a much longer time in order to achieve the type a relative uncertainty at an order of @xmath6 . moreover , the noticeable undesired coil motions will introduce a systematic bias [ 13 ] .",
    "therefore , damping devices are necessary to be employed to suppress these undesired coil motions in the watt / joule balance . in watt balances ,",
    "e.g. , nist-4 at the national institute of standards and technology ( nist , usa ) [ 14 ] , an active damping system has been used during the measurement .",
    "the damping coils in such systems are conventionally located on the framework of the suspended coil . to avoid additional force in the weighing mode and unwanted induced voltage in the velocity mode ,",
    "the damping device is turned off during both measurement modes . during the dynamic measurement mode , the undesired coil motions , however , is not taken care of . in the joule balance at nim to suppress unwanted motions during the measurement without introducing any flux into the main magnet , a novel active electromagnetic damping device , located outside the main magnet , is designed and used .",
    "the merit of the system is that the field of the damping device has no effect on the main field , and hence can be used in both the dynamic and static measurement modes . with the feedback from a detection system , five degrees of freedom of the coil , i.e. the horizontal displacement @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the rotation angles @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , can be controlled by this device .",
    "two functions , i.e. suppressing the undesired coil motions and reducing the misalignment error , then can be realized in the measurements .",
    "the original idea was presented in [ 15 ] . in this paper ,",
    "the principle , construction and performance of the active electromagnetic damping device are presented .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows : the principle of the joule balance is introduced in section 2 ; the principle and construction of the active damping device are presented in section 3 ; the performance of the active damping device in the joule balance is presented in section 4 ; some potential systematic effects using the active damping device , the vertical force and the flux leakage at the mass weighing position , are discussed in section 5 .",
    "the joule balance is the integral of the watt balance .",
    "the mathematical details are presented in [ 12 ] .",
    "the equation is expressed as @xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 denotes the magnetic force , @xmath9 the torque relative to the mass center of the coil , @xmath10 the vector trajectory when the coil is moved from position a to b , @xmath11 the current through the coil , @xmath12 the flux linkage difference of the position b and a.    on the right side of equation ( 1 ) , the product of the flux linkage difference @xmath12 and the current @xmath11 is the magnetic energy change . on the left side of equation ( 1 ) ,",
    "the two integral terms are the work done by the magnetic force and torque .",
    "they can be expressed as @xmath13        note that in equation ( 2 ) only the vertical force , i.e. @xmath14 , can be measured precisely .",
    "the integral terms of the horizontal forces @xmath15 , @xmath16 and torques @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 are parts of the misalignment errors in the joule balance",
    ". other parts of the misalignment errors come from the position change of the coil between the two measurement modes in the joule balance . in equation",
    "( 1 ) , it is assumed that the positions a and b in the measurement of the flux linkage difference are the same as the starting point and ending point of the integral trajectory @xmath10 .",
    "however , it is not the case in the actual measurement . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , when current pass through the coil , the positions a and b will actually shift to a and b. then , equation ( 1 ) can be rewritten as @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the work done by the magnetic force and torque when the coil is respectively moved from position a to a , a to b and b to b. it can be seen from equation ( 3 ) that the misalignment error includes three parts : @xmath21 , @xmath23 and the integral terms of the horizontal forces and torques in @xmath22 .",
    "the active damping device used in the joule balance is able to produce auxiliary horizontal forces and torques on the coil to change the position of the coil .",
    "therefore , with the feedback from the detection system of the five directions of displacement , the position of the coil can be easily controlled . as a result , the positions a and b can be adjusted to be the same as a and b by the feedback of the damping device . in the meanwhile , the horizontal displacement @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the rotation angles @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , can be kept unvaried when the coil is moved along the vector trajectory @xmath10 in the weighting mode of the joule balance .",
    "these two improvements will significantly reduce the misalignment error .",
    "for an ideal case , i.e. the alignment is adjusted to be good enough , only the work done by the vertical force in @xmath22 is left on the left side of equation ( 3 ) and other terms can be ignored .",
    "then equation ( 3 ) can be rewritten as @xmath24.\\ ] ]",

    "it should be noted that the magnetization direction of the three permanent magnets 5 , 12 , 13 is opposite to the magnetization direction of the other three permanent magnets 6 , 7 , 11 . as a result ,",
    "in this magnetic circuit , the magnetic flux in the air gap originates from the yoke 8 and enters the yokes 9 , 10 .",

    "coils 14 and 15 are glued together in fig .",
    "2(c ) and coils 14 and 16 are glued together in fig .",
    "since there are considerable magnetic gradients in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the azimuth @xmath26 , torques and forces will be produced on the auxiliary coils when current passes through the auxiliary coils .",

    "2(c ) is used . in the other one , the combination of the auxiliary coils 14 and 16 shown in fig .",
    "2(d ) is used .",
    "hence , the torque produced by coil 14 in all the three damping segments is used to adjust the rotation angle @xmath2 , @xmath3 of the suspended coil .",
    "the force of coil 15 in two segments points to the center of the suspended coil and can be applied to adjust the horizontal movement @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "the force of coil 16 in the third segment is along the tangential of the suspended coil and can be employed to adjust the rotation along @xmath25 axis , i.e. @xmath4 .",
    "the auxiliary coils are connected to the current sources through the suspension system by fine wires called hairsprings . to reduce the number of the hairsprings and keep the symmetry of the suspended coil , six auxiliary coils are installed in the practical structure instead of nine in the initial design [ 15 ] .",
    "4(a ) shows the six auxiliary coils installed on the suspended system . in theory , to suppress the motions of the five degrees of freedom , the minimum number of auxiliary coils is five .",
    "hence , only two of the three coils 14 are connected to the current sources in practice .",
    "the three damping devices are placed at angles of 120 degrees around the magnet in the joule balance as shown in fig .",
    "the pallets of the damping devices are fixed with respect to the marble shelf in the joule balance which will be kept static .    in the joule balance ,",
    "the suspended coil is kept static while the magnet is moved by a linear translation stage . for the active damping device used in the joule balance ,",
    "the auxiliary coils are always kept static and do not require too much moving space . if such a damping device is used in the velocity mode of watt balances , the length of the inner yokes must be long enough for the movement of the auxiliary coils .",

    "five auxiliary coils are set concentric to the suspended coil with every 120 degrees .",
    "since the horizontal displacement and rotation angle of the suspended coil are in a small range , the relationship between the detection and the auxiliary coil current is close to be linear . in order to check the dependence between the coil motion and the current through the auxiliary coils ,",
