    "chondrules are millimeter - sized silicate spheres with igneous textures embedded in the most common type of meteorites , comprising 5080 % of their mass .",
    "their formation is a long - standing mystery in solar system formation .",
    "radioisotope datings place them among the first solids to have condensed out of the slowly cooling solar nebula . as such",
    ", they represent the remains of early materials that later formed the terrestrial planets .",
    "their nearly spherical shapes and glassy compositions indicate that they cooled within a few hours after being molten , but not in the few seconds that objects that size would cool in free space .",
    "the associated heating event , whatever the origin , must have been transient and localized as evidenced by the inferred rapid heating and cooling rates , and the observed retention of volatiles such as sulfur ( which vaporizes by prolonged heating above 650 k ) .",
    "to explain the high abundance of chondrules , it must have been a widespread phenomenon .",
    "hence , encrypted in chondrules are important clues to physical conditions that prevailed in the early stages of solar system formation .",
    "some even argue that taking the form of millimeter - sized molten spheres is a necessary intermediate step for initially micron - sized dust grains to grow to kilometer - sized objects @xcite .",
    "a successful theory of chondrule formation should at least meet the following constraints : ( 1 ) the extremely short heating timescale of roughly seconds to minutes @xcite , ( 2 ) the cooling rate of @xmath1@xmath2 k hr@xmath3 @xcite , and ( 3 ) the narrow range of sizes ( 0.11@xmath4 ) , inferred from laboratory analyses of textures and compositions as well as from attempts to reproduce chondrules .",
    "in addition , many chondrules show evidences of multiple heating events , so the heating event must have occurred more than once . since the initial discovery 200 years ago @xcite ,",
    "their formation process has received considerable attention in both meteoritics and solar system astronomy , yet it remains elusive @xcite .",
    "proposed mechanisms in the past ( see the summary by * ? ? ?",
    "* for the pros and cons ) include nebula shocks , lightning , and an x - wind .",
    "none of these mechanisms have really been widely accepted @xcite , although recent work on shock heating by @xcite has gained wide attention .",
    "infrared observations and subsequent theoretical modeling of t tauri stars revealed the existence of circumstellar ( protoplanetary ) disks @xcite , many of which are actively accreting ( see , e.g. the review by * ? ? ?",
    "these systems are generally thought to be analogs of the early solar nebula . on the theoretical side , magnetorotational instability ( mri )",
    "provided a solution to the long - standing problem of identifying the cause of anomalous viscosity , which allows mass accretion of the disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* collectively referred to as bh91 hereafter ) .",
    "when applied to partially ionized disks , it remains an efficient mechanism of generating turbulence as long as ions are sufficiently well - coupled to neutrals , i.e. , if ion - neutral collision rate far exceeds the orbital rotation rate : @xmath5 @xcite . in the case of protoplanetary disks , however , a large portion , especially near the disk midplane , is associated with relatively low ionization fraction ( @xmath6 ) , and hence thought to be magnetically dead @xcite .    in partially ionized disks ,",
    "ambipolar diffusion arises because magnetic forces act on the charged component , i.e. ions , only @xcite . as the ions drift through neutrals ,",
    "the magnetic field lines drag the ions with them , steepening field gradients near magnetic nulls stretched by shear flows ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bz94 ) .",
    "consequently , sheets of high electric current form , as was confirmed by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "bz94 originally proposed this as a mechanism for rapid magnetic reconnection in the interstellar medium .",
    "ambipolar diffusion is important in another context : as a heating source @xcite .",
    "recently , using three - dimensional simulations of turbulent , magnetized molecular clouds , @xcite pointed out that ambipolar diffusion heating is a significant source of heating in molecular clouds and that it can be larger than the cosmic ray heating . in this paper",
    ", we examine the possibility that similar physics operates in protoplanetary disks , such as in the solar nebula that eventually became our solar system .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we show that current sheets are generated in magnetically active regions within protoplanetary disks .",
    "we study the properties of these current sheets and determine when and where the associated heating becomes significant .",
    "second , we apply this formalism to the following two unresolved issues : the heating mechanism that melted chondrules in the early solar nebula and the near - infrared excesses observed in spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of young stellar objects .",
    "we later demonstrate that the heating of dust grains by current sheets is ineffective for a standard model of the early solar nebula in which the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath7 .",
    "however , at lower gas densities and much higher dust - to - gas ratios than those usually assumed in the standard model , these current sheets are found to reach high enough temperatures to melt millimeter - sized dust grains .",
    "we propose that these unusual conditions occur near the midplane in late stages of solar nebula evolution , when the gas surface density has decreased due to various mechanisms discussed below , and dust grains have gravitationally settled .",
    "the surfaces of this dust - enriched midplane layer are then sufficiently dense and ionized to host thin ( @xmath8 ) , hot ( @xmath9 ) current sheets .",
    "circulation of dust to the surface by turbulence within the dust layer is invoked to explain the observed high abundance of chondrules .",
    "the basic features of our current sheet model are set forth in   [ csmodel ] . in   [ energy ]",
    "we use this model to investigate a scenario in which chondrules are heated inside current sheets , solving numerically the coupled equations of energy transfer for gas and dust particles .",
    "the results are presented in   [ results ] .",
    "we argue , in   [ midplane ] , that in late stages of solar nebula evolution current sheets capable of melting most of the millimeter - sized dust particles form in the dust - rich midplane . in   [ nearir ] we discuss possible observational signatures of current sheets . finally , in   [ caveats ]",
    "we list limitations of our model .",
    "the magnetic field evolves according to the induction equation , @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the electron velocity and @xmath12 is the associated resistivity given by @xmath13 @xcite . here , @xmath14 is the speed of light , @xmath15 is the electron fraction , and @xmath16 is the ambient gas temperature . for the last equality in eqn .",
    "( [ eta ] ) , we adopt the value of the electrical conductivity , @xmath17 , from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "subscripts @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 denote quantities pertaining to electron , ion , and neutral components , respectively .",
    "other quantities of relevance in this paper are the mean mass per particle of @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the proton mass , and the mean ion mass of @xmath23 at densities where ionized potassium , k@xmath24 , is generally the dominant ion species @xcite .    in the ideal mhd limit , the electron velocity is indistinguishable from the center - of - mass velocity of the fluid .",
    "this approximation breaks down in two ways as @xmath25 decreases .",
    "first , ions slip through neutrals , and for low enough @xmath25 , when ion pressure and inertia can be neglected , the strong coupling approximation can be used to compute the ambipolar drift velocity by balancing the lorentz force @xmath26 acting on the ions against the frictional drag @xmath27 arising from collisions with neutrals .",
    "second , when ions and electrons move along a direction perpendicular to a magnetic field , they experience the lorentz force acting normal to both directions but they drift away in two opposite directions due to the different signs of their electric charges .",
    "this causes the hall effect .",
    "the electron velocity in a weakly ionized medium is then @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the ion mass density and ion - neutral collision rate .",
    "the value of the drag coefficient , @xmath31 @xmath32 s@xmath3 g@xmath3 @xcite . since @xmath33 in our case ( see   [ mri ] ) , the neutral velocity is the same as the center - of - mass velocity , @xmath34 .",
    "the current density has the usual form @xmath35 .",
    "we plug eqn .",
    "( [ ve ] ) into eqn .",
    "( [ ind1 ] ) and consider the case in which the currents and fields are perpendicular ( @xmath36 ) , so the induction equation becomes @xmath37 \\ , .\\ ] ] the hall term does not affect the time evolution of @xmath38 , since @xmath39 vanishes .",
    "thus , ambipolar diffusion acts as _ an additional field - dependent resistivity_. we define the ambipolar diffusion coefficient as @xmath40 where @xmath41 means @xmath42 in gauss .    for our model of the protoplanetary disk , we take the minimum - mass solar nebula of @xcite .",
    "it is characterized by the surface mass density @xmath43 with @xmath44 g @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the radial distance from the central star , and the temperature profile given by @xmath47 .",
    "we expect @xmath48 to decrease in time as the nebular gas clears out in the late stage of protoplanetary disk evolution .",
    "hence we use the form @xmath49 g @xmath45 , where @xmath50 is an arbitrary parameter less than or equal to unity .",
    "if we take the gas to be isothermal , the vertical density profile in hydrostatic equilibrium has a gaussian form ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cg97 ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 @xmath53 is the number density of gas in the disk midplane , @xmath54 is the vertical distance measured from the midplane , and @xmath55 is the scale height . here , as usual",
    ", @xmath56 is the sound speed and @xmath57 is the keplerian rotation rate . with these values",
    ", we can roughly estimate the importance of ambipolar diffusion by taking the ratio of the two coefficients in eqn .",
    "( [ ind2 ] ) : @xmath58 we note that ( 1 ) with a magnetic field sufficiently amplified ( up to @xmath591 g ) , ambipolar diffusion is at least as important as ohmic dissipation and ( 2 ) the ratio has strong spatial dependence within the disk .",
    "remnant magnetism in meteorites suggests that @xmath60 1 g was typical in the solar nebula .",
    "if an efficient dynamo is in action , the ambipolar diffusion term would generally be important in the outer ( @xmath61 1 au ) region of the disk . in the inner region , for a similar value of @xmath42 and @xmath62 , it is nonnegligible only a few scale heights above and below the midplane , where gas density is much lower .",
    "it generally becomes increasingly important as @xmath50 decreases .      compared to other astrophysical systems ,",
    "protoplanetary disks are unusually cold and dense and are therefore associated with very low ionization fractions .",
    "ionization fraction is a key parameter in determining whether a disk will be turbulent or not , since the mri is confined to regions where the ionization fraction is high enough to ensure good coupling between ions and neutrals .",
    "this occurs when the ion - neutral collision rate ( @xmath63 ) is significantly greater ( by 3100 at least ) than the rotation rate ( @xmath57 ) @xcite .",
    "the critical ionization fraction is calculated to be @xmath64 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , this value is only slightly higher than the values of @xmath65@xmath66 estimated in the bulk of protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "many numerical simulations have demonstrated that mri - induced velocity shears amplify the magnetic field ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our model , perturbations in the magnetic field are also assumed to be generated by the mri .",
    "considering the low values of @xmath67 estimated in protoplanetary disks , it is initially unclear whether this assumption is valid or not . therefore we ask : which region of the solar nebula , if any , is prone to the mri ?",
    "( previous numerical simulations assumed ionization fraction @xmath68 . )",
    "this question has been investigated by several authors @xcite .",
    "their results are as follows .",
    "the ionization fraction is sufficiently high in the innermost region of the disk up to a few tenths of an au , where the ambient gas temperature is high enough ( @xmath69 k ) for collisional ionization to be effective ( where it dominates over cosmic ray and radioactive element ionizations ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also , cosmic rays and stellar x - ray radiation ionize the surface layers ( with thickness given by the stopping depth of @xmath70 g/@xmath71 ) at @xmath72 au and the entire disk at @xmath73 au , where the surface density of the disk falls below @xmath74 . these , then , are the regions where the disk is turbulent , hence effectively transferring angular momentum and also actively accreting . on the other hand ,",
    "the region near the disk midplane , where terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt now lie , is generally thought to contain no significant heating source and be quiescent , i.e. magnetically dead ( radioactive heating is too inefficient to maintain @xmath75 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "these considerations led to the layered accretion model of gammie ( 1996 ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "there are two length scales , other than the scale height @xmath76 , of relevance to this discussion .",
    "the wavelength of perturbation most unstable to the mri is only slightly larger than the critical wavelength at which the instability sets in ( bh91 ) and is given by @xmath77 ( bh91 ) .",
    "other processes affect the growth of perturbations : in dense parts of the disk , collisions with neutrals hinder the charged components from drifting with the magnetic field . in this case ,",
    "ohmic dissipation acts to stabilize wavelengths shorter than the resistive diffusion scale @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the alfven speed .",
    "in other words , the critical wavelength at which mri sets in is given by @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath81 , the perturbation growth becomes much slower .",
    "an additional constraint enters when @xmath82 becomes comparable to the scale height @xmath76 ; at this point , saturation of the mri is thought to occur @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated where the mri operates in protoplanetary disks by including a detailed chemical reaction scheme and the effect of the recombination of ions and electrons on grain surfaces .",
    "they showed that for the minimum - mass solar nebula ( @xmath62 ) the 23 au region of the disk would be stabilized by ohmic dissipation .",
    "however , as the surface density parameter , @xmath50 , is lowered , the unstable region expands ( see their figure 8) .",
    "also , as the disk evolves , dust grains settle to a thin layer in the midplane , and so the grain abundance in the bulk of the nebula gradually decreases .",
    "for this reason , sano et al .",
    "( 2000 ) introduced a dust depletion factor , @xmath83 , which measures the abundance of dust grains relative to that in molecular clouds .",
    "thus a low value of @xmath83 may correspond to an old , evolved disk .",
    "they demonstrated that as @xmath83 decreases for a given surface density , the stable region ( the `` dead zone '' ) shrank in size , and for @xmath84 , the entire disk becomes unstable for @xmath85 au ( see their figure 11 ) .",
    "this happens because the recombination rate on grain surfaces decreases .",
    "they found a similar trend as grain growth occurs . from these results , we conclude that the region at @xmath86 au will become magnetically active at a sufficiently late stage of the evolution .",
    "we use and discuss this result further in   [ apply ] .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] compares the three relevant length scales at an early ( a ) and a late stage ( b ) of solar nebula evolution .",
    "the region of interest where magnetic fields amplify due to the mri extends from 2 au to 4 au in ( a ) , while with a reduced gas density , the active region moves inward to 12 au ( b ) .      in this and the following sections , we consider a simple , one - dimensional geometry illustrated in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "also shown are the directions of various terms in eqns .",
    "( [ ve ] ) and ( [ ind2 ] ) .",
    "consider first a case in which a magnetic null is present .",
    "near the null , a magnetic pressure gradient , @xmath87 , acts on ions and pushes the field lines into the null point in both directions .",
    "the ion - neutral drift is then directed toward the null . along a gradient in the magnetic field",
    ", this nonlinear term produces faster field diffusion in regions of stronger field , driving field into regions of weaker field and steepening the gradient , rather than spreading it out as the linear ohmic term does .",
    "ultimately , the gradient sharpens towards a singularity , marked by a sheet of high electric current .",
    "this steepening of magnetic field profile ( bz94 ) occurs within a timescale of @xmath88 , calculated to be @xmath89 of the orbital period when @xmath90 .",
    "the factor of 1/2 in @xmath91 takes into account the fact that the characteristic length decreases as steepening proceeds .",
    "remarkably , this sharpening has been shown to occur even in the absence of nulls due to a variety of processes including a rotating eddy ( bz94 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , accretion disks sustaining the mri @xcite , large amplitude alfven waves @xcite , and the nonlinear stage of wardle c - shocks @xcite .",
    "as previously mentioned , we take the example of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence driven by the mri . in this case , velocity shears produce magnetic nulls and current singularities .",
    "stretched by shear flows , magnetic nulls develop where the magnetic field changes directions .",
    "we therefore crudely estimate that the separation between two adjacent magnetic nulls @xmath92 .",
    "we note that ambipolar diffusion allows the field to slip through the neutrals and tends to weaken the mri . for strong enough diffusion , i.e.",
    "when the ion - neutral collision rate ( @xmath63 ) is much higher than the growth rate of the mri ( @xmath93 ) , the instability is entirely prevented @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , ambipolar diffusion is required to generate current sheets . for our model ,",
    "we use parameters on the interface between the two regimes .",
    "this choice is justified by two - dimensional simulations performed by @xcite , which showed that for drag coefficients @xmath94 a few times the minimum value that allows the instability to develop , @xmath95 , both the instability and ambipolar diffusion sharpening occur .",
    "in other words , we require @xmath96 .",
    "alternatively , magnetic field amplification could have preceeded the epoch of current sheet formation .",
    "we now make quantitative estimates of the properties of current sheets .",
    "bz94 showed that , in the absence of resistivity , the magnetic field profile relaxes to @xmath97 , and the current density @xmath98 becomes singular at the origin . in reality , both the finite resistivity and the ion pressure act to remove this singularity @xcite . under the physical conditions of protoplanetary disks ,",
    "ion pressure can be neglected @xcite .",
    "the induction term in eqn .",
    "( [ ind2 ] ) , @xmath99 , becomes progressively less important as the field steepens ; @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 denote the magnitudes of the induction and ohmic dissipation term respectively , and is therefore ignored .",
    "the quasi - steady - state magnetic field profile ( `` quasi '' since the magnetic field profile lasts only as long as the velocity shear is present , for about a dynamical time ) is calculated by balancing the ohmic dissipation term against the ambipolar diffusion term in eqn .",
    "( [ ind2 ] ) : @xmath103 here , for simplicity , we use the definition @xmath104 which measures the relative importance of ohmic dissipation to ambipolar diffusion .",
    "we used @xmath105 and @xmath106 to denote @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "ohmic dissipation dominates where @xmath109 ; ambipolar diffusion wins where @xmath110 ( see eqn . [ ratio ] ) .",
    "remarkably , @xmath111 is independent of the ionization fraction ; so is the magnetic field profile . solving eqn .",
    "( [ balance ] ) , we obtain @xmath112 assuming that the field vanishes at the origin . an integration constant , @xmath113 , is determined by the boundary condition @xmath114 , which leads to @xmath115 .",
    "the amplitude of the magnetic field , @xmath116 , is determined from the remnant magnetic field strengths recorded in the matrix of chondrites ( 0.11 g ) and in chondrules themselves ( 110 g ) ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . from eqn .",
    "( [ cubic ] ) , we see that @xmath117 near the origin , and the effect of resistivity yields @xmath118 .",
    "note the current density singularity is now removed ; the maximum current density near the origin is given by @xmath119 , which is finite .",
    "sufficiently far from the origin where @xmath120 is satisfied , @xmath121 holds , and we retain the result in the non - resistive limit of bz94 .",
    "there , the current density declines steeply ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "we therefore set @xmath123 and compute the width of the current sheet to be @xmath124 this expression is valid for @xmath125 , which is satisfied under the conditions of interest .",
    "inside current sheets , two heating mechanisms act .",
    "first , electrons and ions are accelerated by the electric field present , and then collide with neutrals and heat up the entire gas , leading to familiar ohmic dissipation .",
    "the corresponding heating rate per unit volume essentially follows from the magnetic field profile : @xmath126 there is additional heating due to friction when ions , accelerated by the lorentz force , diffuse through neutrals ( see , e.g. ,   [ eqns ] of this paper ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case of ambipolar diffusion heating , @xmath127 yields the volumetric heating rate .",
    "note that their ratio is given simply by @xmath128 . within the range of parameters we are interested in ,",
    "the ambipolar diffusion heating integrated through the current sheet along @xmath129 exceeds ( by a factor of @xmath5910 in our fiducial model ) the contribution from ohmic dissipation .",
    "the resulting heating profiles ( log @xmath130 vs. log @xmath129 ) as a function of @xmath111 , defined in eqn .",
    "( [ b0 ] ) , are displayed in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "they are naturally symmetric around @xmath131 . in terms of shape , these double peaks are similar to what has been observed in numerical simulations of @xcite , although their sheets are produced by supersonic shocks and density compressions .",
    "ambipolar diffusion sharpening becomes more efficient at lower gas densities ( see eqn .",
    "[ lcs ] ) , and the current densities become close to singular .",
    "this implies stronger and more concentrated heating far above and below the disk midplane .",
    "alternatively , if the disk becomes thinner with time @xcite , the heating rate also increases .",
    "for example , soon after thermonuclear reactions began in the sun , a powerful solar wind is thought to have blown away the gas @xmath590.1 to a few million years after the solar nebula formed .",
    "accretion onto the central star or , in local regions , planetary accretion as gap formation occurs would have the same effect .",
    "a density drop caused by any of these mechanisms introduces a regime where chondrule formation is favored .",
    "as the overall gas density @xmath132 drops in time , @xmath133 , so the peak heating rate rises .",
    "we investigate chondrule heating in current sheets by solving numerically the coupled equations of energy transfer for gas and dust particles , and compare the results with the experimental constraints on chondrule formation .",
    "dust particles are usually assumed to possess a power - law distribution of sizes with upper and lower size cutoffs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for simplicity , we use just two types of dust particles : small , micron - sized dust grains with radius @xmath134 and bigger , millimeter - sized chondrules with @xmath135 .",
    "also , it is assumed that the same amount of mass is contained in each type .",
    "near the dust melting temperature , small grains radiate in the near - infrared most efficiently .",
    "hence their thermal evolution is of considerable importance to the overall development of current sheets .    to study how these current sheets affect the temperatures of dust particles that emit the bulk of the infrared radiation",
    ", we use the one - dimensional slab geometry considered in @xcite . dust and gas travel through a current sheet with relative velocity of @xmath136 , where @xmath136 is a free parameter of the model but assumed to be comparable to the alfven speed , @xmath79 , and smaller than 17 km s@xmath3 , the keplerian orbital speed at @xmath137 au . for our fiducial model ,",

    "the gas and dust temperatures are uniform in each zone but in general differ from each other .",
    "the temperatures evolve in time and are assumed to vary only in one spatial direction ( @xmath129 ) .    entering a current sheet , gas molecules gain energy from the two heating mechanisms mentioned in   [ hmech ] and lose it through collisions with dust grains and chondrules",
    ". the collisional heat transfer rate per unit surface area between gas and dust , denoted by @xmath140 , is defined as @xmath141 and @xmath142 is defined similarly for chondrules @xcite .",

    "dust grains and chondrules , on the other hand , are heated both by colliding with hotter gas molecules and by absorbing radiation from nearby smaller , micron - sized , grains which reach high temperatures quickly .",

    "@xmath180 @xmath53 and both @xmath181 and @xmath182 are set to yield desired values of the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath171 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the time evolution of gas , dust , and chondrule temperatures at a fixed position as a current sheet moves through , for our model runs with @xmath183 ( 5 , 50 ) .",
    "we also ran the code for @xmath184 but do not plot the result because both @xmath158 and @xmath159 remain practically unchanged at @xmath185 for over @xmath2 s. we find that for @xmath186 the gas temperature rises appreciably ( above 1000 k ) but , due to poor thermal coupling between gas and dust , neither @xmath158 nor @xmath159 changes significantly , reaching only @xmath187 k after 10@xmath188 s. in the run with @xmath183 50 , however , due to the increase in optical depth , dust grains follow the gas temperature closely and the radiation field also steadily increases in strength .",
    "the grains melt after about 570 seconds and evaporate after about 630 seconds , at which point we stop the simulation , as it does not take into account the evaporation of particles .",
    "we changed the boundary condition between flat at @xmath185 and a floating boundary condition but found the result remained qualitatively the same . in an improved model that accounts for evaporation and a range of dust grain sizes",
    ", we expect the smallest grains to evaporate first , decreasing the optical depth , thus widening the heated region and lowering the net volumetric heating rate .",
    "the larger grains will therefore probably not evaporate .",
    "this is interesting since it could naturally explain the peaking of the size distribution of chondrules around 1 mm .",
    "the fact that chondrules get melted only for high values of @xmath171 is consistent with the feo record in chondrules , which seems to indicate oxygen fugacities ( relative abundance of oxygen to hydrogen ) at formation that are higher than solar values by at least two or three orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this is most often interpreted to mean that chondrules were heated in regions with extremely high dust - to - gas ratios .",
    "the dust is taken to be oxides of si , mg , ca , al , etc .",
    "in chondritic proportions which bring in a large amount of oxygen .",
    "for this reason also , it is advantageous to evaporate the smaller grains first because then oxides will be incorporated into the gas and the partial pressures of condensable elements will increase locally .",
    "this helps to make liquids stable at high temperature , and also suppresses the evaporation of silicate liquids which would have caused heavy isotope enrichment of resulting chondrules ; such enrichment is not observed @xcite .",
    "@xcite gives a full treatment of what dust enrichments are necessary to make feo - bearing silicates and also to make chondrule liquids stable at low pressure relative to solids , as well as a discussion of dust - enrichment scenarios with high oxygen fugacities .",
    "the idea that the midplane is a better place to consider chondrule formation is supported again in this context .",
    "the value of the gas density used in figure [ fig4 ] is @xmath180 @xmath53 corresponding to @xmath189 . since we expect the gas density in the disk to decrease to this level after a time of order a few million years , this argues for chondrule formation in a late , evolved disk , and is consistent with the age difference between cais ( refractory ca - al - rich inclusions ) and chondrules , estimated from the decay of @xmath190al ( with a half - life of 0.7 myr ) to be 23 myr @xcite .      from the results in the previous section , we conclude that in a standard model of the early solar nebula in which dust and gas are well - mixed , the disk will have @xmath172 everywhere and",
    "hence heating of dust grains by current sheets will not be effective .",
    "this conclusion no longer holds in the late stage of the disk evolution .",
    "as argued by @xcite , the bulk of the disk becomes unstable to the mri , therefore susceptible to current sheet formation , for low enough values of the surface density factor @xmath50 or of the dust depletion factor @xmath83 because the recombination rate on grain surfaces decreases and thus @xmath67 rises except in a thin layer around the midplane .",
    "current sheets capable of melting mm - sized dust grains form only when @xmath191 @xmath53 and @xmath171 is quite high , i.e. near the disk midplane .",
    "for these reasons , we henceforth consider a late stage of solar nebula evolution in which the gaseous disk has depleted by a factor of 10 ( @xmath189 ) and settling of dust grains onto the midplane has proceeded significantly ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "let us first estimate the thickness of this dust - rich layer .",
    "we assume that @xmath171 has increased from the well - mixed value of @xmath193 to @xmath194 .",
    "taking into account the reduction in gas density , the vertical scale height of dust grains is expected to decrease by a factor of 500 compared to the gas scale height of 0.1 au at @xmath195 au .",
    "thus a thickness of @xmath196 km is estimated .",
    "this thin dust - rich layer around the midplane will be mostly magnetically dead because of the extremely high dust density there , and the resulting high recombination rate on grain surfaces @xcite . yet",
    ", the thin surfaces of this dust layer will be sufficiently ionized by cosmic rays and stellar x - ray radiation to support the mri and generate current sheets , considering that there are now few dust grains suspended in the upper atmosphere .",
    "current sheets that form in these thin layers will ionize nearby regions within the dust layer , into optical depth of order unity .",
    "dust grains are heated after passing through these current sheets , sometimes up to their melting temperature ( @xmath197 k ) as shown in   [ energy ] , and then radiate strongly in the near - infrared , subsequently raising the temperature of dust grains in the surrounding environment .",
    "collisions with hot dust grains may then ionize , k@xmath24 ) .",
    "grains are dominant charge carriers at @xmath198 k , but at higher @xmath16 desorption of charged ions from the surface of dust grains becomes effective @xcite .",
    "thus , our neglect of the effect of charged dust grains is partially justified , at least inside current sheets . ] the gas in an initially magnetically dead area above the critical value , @xmath199 .",
    "however , the integrated optical depth of the protosolar nebula at @xmath200 to the near - infrared radiation in the vertical direction is estimated to be @xmath201 @xcite . even if we assume that some of the smallest , submicron - sized grains have been removed from the nebula with the gas , the magnetically active region affected by current sheets would still be only a few percent of the dust - rich layer . to melt the majority of the dust grains that reside in the midplane and form chondrules ,",
    "the entire layer must be in motion so that all dust particles are exposed in the magnetically active surface layer at some point .",
    "when most of the solids have settled to the midplane , vertical shear between the gas and the differentially rotating , dense particle layer can drive turbulence within a 10@xmath20210@xmath203 km thick boundary layer @xcite .",
    "although vertical velocity gradients vanish by symmetry very near the midplane , a turbulence model that self - consistently deals with generation , transport , and damping shows that the turbulence diffuses inward and persists even very near the midplane ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we take a typical velocity of @xmath204 cm s@xmath3 [ @xmath205see eqn .",
    "( 65 ) of the previous reference@xmath205 ] and the thickness of the dust layer , @xmath207 km , and estimate the eddy turnover time to be @xmath208 yr .",
    "keeping in mind that the fraction of current sheets covering the dust surface is quite small ( @xmath209 ; see the next subsection ) , we expect an average dust grain to be exposed to current sheet heating about once every @xmath196 yrs .",
    "after the brief heating , now spherical , mm - sized chondrules will settle down to the midplane , collecting rims of dust in the process .",
    "such rims are observed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the higher than predicted flux at 28 @xmath156 observed in the spectra of some young protoplanetary disks has been known for a decade @xcite . using a disk model that included an accounting of grain size distributions and grain compositions , and numerical solution of the equations of radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium under the two - layer approximation of cg97",
    ", @xcite rediscovered this in 4 of their 5 herbig ae and t tauri stars , and found a relative dearth of emission shortward of 10@xmath156 arising partly from low absorption efficiencies of silicate grains .",
    "it is noteworthy that these sources also showed evidence for dust settling ; parameters appropriate for gas and dust that are well - mixed in interstellar proportions did not fit the overall level of infrared excess at @xmath210 for 4 of them .",
    "they interpreted this to mean that dust in disk surface layers has settled vertically towards the midplane .",
    "@xcite proposed a disk model in which an inner rim located at the dust evaporation radius forms a vertical wall due to direct heating by the central star and , as a result , puffs up and intersects more starlight .",
    "its reemitted flux produces a bump that peaks at 23@xmath156 in the sed .",
    "they note that this modification would be significant only for herbig ae stars .",
    "this mechanism works only if optical depth due to gas opacity in the inner hole is negligible , but in fact it is quite large , of order 10@xmath188 , when a standard surface mass density profile @xmath211 is assumed , although the surface density of the inner disk is not constrained by the data @xcite .",
    "we suggest an alternative mechanism by noting that current sheets at the dust melting temperature would radiate at just the right wavelengths to fill in the deficient flux at 28 @xmath212 m , perhaps explaining the excess near - ir fluxes . a simple estimate can be made as follows .",
    "we take the mean separation between current sheets ( produced by the brandenburg - zweibel mechanism ) to be @xmath213 , roughly the distance between two adjacent magnetic nulls produced by the mri . the total emission from dust grains inside current sheets",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath214 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx & 10^{32 } \\left ( \\frac{\\lambda_{\\mu}^4 \\ , [ \\ , \\exp \\ , ( 9/\\lambda_{\\mu})-1 \\ , ] } { 2 \\times 10 ^ 3 } \\right)^{\\!-1 } \\ , \\rm{erg \\ , s^{-1 } } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath180 @xmath53 at @xmath215 .",
    "here , @xmath216 is the wavelength of radiation in microns .",
    "taking @xmath217 and @xmath218 , we obtain @xmath209 for the fraction covered by current sheets in the region between 1 and 2 au , the site of their formation in an evolved disk thinned by @xmath189 ( see figure [ fig1]b ) . this crude estimate for the excess near - ir emission from current sheets may partly explain the observed excesses in the range of 10@xmath21910@xmath220 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "uncertainties in modeling of protoplanetary disks at present are admittedly large .",
    "our mechanism involving current sheets could be taken as an example of producing near - ir excesses when magnetohydrodynamical effects are considered .",
    "ultimately , these ideas can be tested by searching for distinguishable observable signatures using techniques that have recently emerged .",
    "interferometric imaging of lkh@xmath221 in the h and k bands by @xcite has shown a central gap ( or cavity ) and a hot inner edge , observed at 3.4 au from the central star when a distance of 160 pc to lkh@xmath221 is assumed .",
    "earlier theoretical predictions for its radius to fit the near - ir inflections in the sed ( @xmath222 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are too small by around an order of magnitude . if we can divide the disk into several annular regions and obtain photometric measurements of each annulus , we suggest that there would be a local maximum of near - ir radiation between 1 and 2 au , for systems like our primordial solar nebula ( although for other young stellar objects , the exact position will depend on stellar and disk parameters and should be recalculated ) . in standard protoplanetary disk models such as cg97",
    ", the mentioned region reaches temperatures of only @xmath223 k and is expected to emit poorly in the near - ir . in the near future , a multi - band , adaptive optics coronagraph under development at the american museum of natural history @xcite will be used to directly view protoplanetary disks and will present another possibility to test these theories .",
    "our conclusions suffer from several caveats .",
    "all models of the current sheets that have been done to date have assumed a steady state flow ( bz94 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the heating and ionization that occur in the current sheet are not accounted for self - consistently in these models .",
    "both will increase the ion pressure in the center of the sheet , either saturating the singularity or even blowing the sheet apart . also , we invoke turbulence induced by the mri when calculating magnetic field fluctuations but ignore its effect on the evolution of current sheets , e.g. the converging motion of the neutrals in ambipolar diffusion . in our simplified chondrule formation model ,",
    "we let gas and dust travel through a current sheet at @xmath224 km s@xmath3 , but it is not clear how well this approximates the actual condition near a current sheet or if a current sheet would survive in that environment . to study these effects in detail",
    "a dynamical model will be necessary .",
    "this requires modeling the interplay between at least four physical processes : pressure imbalance , ionization evolution , temperature evolution , and steepening of the magnetic field .",
    "these four processes are inherently connected and feed back on one another .",
    "that means they must be solved simultaneously in a self - consistent fashion .",
    "radiative transfer and a power - law size distribution of dust grains must be incorporated in a subsequent step to understand chondrule formation in these dynamical models .",
    "the large range of timescales and length scales involved presents another challenge for modeling of this complicated set of processes .",
