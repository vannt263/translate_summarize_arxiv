    "the field of topological insulators ( tis ) is currently witnessing enormous interest in condensed matter  @xcite .",
    "the predecessor of tis is the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe )  @xcite realized in a two - dimensional electron gas with a strong perpendicular magnetic field . similar to other",
    "tis discovered more recently , the iqhe is a gapped state of matter characterized by topologically robust edge states and a bulk topological invariant known as the chern number or the thouless - kohmoto - nightingale - den nijs ( tknn ) number@xcite .",
    "the iqh state has been generalized to lattice models without orbital magnetic field@xcite , which are named as quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) states or chern insulators ( ci ) .",
    "qah states have been proposed in realistic materials@xcite . in 1983 ,",
    "the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) was discovered in systems with a fractionally filled landau level@xcite . since then",
    ", the fqhe has become a paradigmatic example of a topologically ordered phase  @xcite where interactions exhibit non - perturbative roles .",
    "numerous fundamental developments evolved out of this direction , such as the concept of non - abelian statistics which forms the foundation of topological quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "one fundamental difference from iqhe is that the flatness of the landau level and its associated freezing of kinetic energy appear to be necessary conditions for the fqhe state to be energetically preferable .",
    "this immediately provokes the question of whether a fractional chern insulator ( fci ) can be realized , i.e. a lattice version of the fqhe without an external magnetic field .",
    "taking a ci such as haldane s honeycomb model  @xcite as a natural starting point , the task then is to drive the system into the flat band limit where the chemical potential lies within this band , e.g. at fractional one third filling , which is well separated from the other bands and hence accomplishes a fqhe - type lattice scenario .",
    "( unlike the quantum hall case , the fci filling is not given by the ratio of electrons over magnetic flux quanta , but the chemical potential of the lattice model . ) different groups have recently independently pursued this direction , proposing fci models on the honeycomb , kagome , square , and checkerboard lattice  @xcite . in different ways",
    ", the flattening of the chern band can be accomplished through geometric frustration ( e.g. long - range hopping )  @xcite , multi - band effects  @xcite , and multi - orbital character  @xcite . while the @xmath1 and @xmath2-type orbitals in previous candidates materials for topological insulators would assume only moderate interactions from small hybridizations , @xmath3-orbital - type systems provide an arena for both strong correlations and topological band structures  @xcite .",
    "first numerical investigations of the fci phases on a torus at one third band filling found indications of a three - fold topologically degenerate ground state separated from the other energy levels by a gap , where the flux insertion showed level crossings with no level repulsion between them , and the chern numbers of these many - body ground states found to be @xmath4 each  @xcite . while this already gives a strong hint that a laughlin - type fractional chern phase might be realized , this does not yet completely rule out a competing charge density wave ( cdw ) state at this filling , which can show similar fractional chern numbers in the ground states , level degeneracy , and a gap .",
    "further evidence against a cdw state , however , has been found by finite size scaling , entanglement measures , and the distribution of ground state momenta as a function of cluster size@xcite .",
    "compared to the fqhe for which the joint perspective of energy and entanglement measures generally gives a consistent and complementary picture , the current stage of fci models particularly calls for further investigation .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on further developing the understanding of fci phases from the perspective of energetics and interactions . in general , fcis involve different scales such as the kinetic bandwidth of the fractionally filled chern band , the gap separation from other bands , as well as the magnitude and range of interactions .",
    "even if we assume a conventional fqhe - type parameter window where inter - band scattering is neglected and the bandwidth of the fractional chern band is assumed small versus the interaction strength , a crucial complication of fci models is the inhomogeneous berry curvature which has no quantum hall analogue . as a signature of this difference , the platzman - girvin - macdonald algebra  @xcite of the lowest landau level ( lll ) can only be mapped to the lattice chern density operators in the continuum limit as well as for homogeneous berry curvature  @xcite , from where hamiltonian theories can be constructed  @xcite . however , an exact one - to - one mapping between fqh and fci states with chern number @xmath5 has been established by the wannier state representation of chern insulators@xcite despite of the inhomogeneous berry curvature .",
    "( one - dimensional ) wannier states are single particle states which are localized in real space in one spatial direction ( such as @xmath6 ) , but are momentum eigenstates in the orthogonal direction @xmath7 .",
    "different wannier states are related by translation in @xmath6 direction , and all wannier states form a complete basis of the single particle hilbert space defined by a non - degenerate energy band . the exact mapping between fqh and fci is obtained by mapping landau level wavefunctions in the landau gauge to the wannier states in fci .",
    "more details of this mapping will be reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : wannier ] . from the wannier state representation , we learn that the effect of inhomogeneous berry curvature is absent if we consider a special hamiltonian obtained by mapping a fqh hamiltonian to the fci system . in other words ,",
    "the effect of inhomogeneous berry curvature in an fci strongly depends on the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "in two recent works@xcite , the wannier state representation and its further improvement has been investigated in both fermionic and bosonic fci systems . in the bosonic @xmath8 fci",
    ", the wavefunction proposed by the wannier state representation has a high overlap with the exact ground state wavefunction obtained by exact diagonalization@xcite . in the fermionic @xmath9 case ,",
    "such a high overlap is also achieved given that the wannier states are modified@xcite .",
    "therefore the validity of the wannier state representation has been demonstrated at least in those simplest fci states .",
    "an important part of this paper will concern the development of a pseudopotential ( pp ) formalism for fractional chern insulators .",
    "previously , pps have been established in the context of fqhe  @xcite .",
    "pps are partial wave expansions of the coulomb interactions .",
    "the resulting expansion quantum number is the relative angular momentum @xmath10 of two particles ( with @xmath10 even for bosons and odd for fermions ) where the expansion coefficients @xmath11 denote the energy penalty of two particles having a relative angular momentum of @xmath10 . in the same way the landau level wave functions were used as a basis for defining such an expansion in fqhe",
    ", we now employ a similar construction for the fci wannier functions  @xcite .",
    "pps proved extremely useful in fqhe not only to give a universal classification of different interaction profiles , but also to obtain an adequate description of general fqhe phase diagrams .",
    "furthermore , many paradigmatic fqh wave functions are exact ground states of certain pp hamiltonians for which representative finite size studies would be more accurate to resolve their universal properties than for a generic interaction scenario  @xcite . in adapting this concept to fci models , we can hope for a similarly promising route to a deeper and more universal understanding of fci hamiltonians .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : wannier ] , we review and expand the description of the wannier state representation of fractional chern bands . this lays the foundation for the definition of fci pps , for which we first review the pp formalism for fqhe and subsequently develop the fci formulation of pps in section  [ sec : pp ] . in section  [ sec : model ] , we apply our pp formalism to different fci models and their interaction profiles .",
    "we find that , as a direct consequence of inhomogeneous berry curvature , there is a portion of the interactions which can not be expanded in pps .",
    "these observations will be analysed in detail in section  [ sec : cmmt ] .",
    "there , we classify what type of center - of - mass ( cm ) breaking and magnetic - translation - group ( mt ) breaking scattering elements appear in fci interactions , and how these symmetries are potentially reemergent in an effective low energy theory of the problem  @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : mbpp ] , we generalize the fci pp principle to many - body interactions , which enables us to define exact hamiltonians for non - abelian fci phases . in section  [ sec : concl ] , we conclude that the pseudopotential formalism establishes a suitable platform to further investigate and analyze new states of matter in fcis .",
    "in this section , we review the wannier state representation of fcis proposed in ref . .",
    "the idea of this approach is to find a suitable single - particle basis , the one - dimensional ( 1d ) wannier state basis , and to use this basis to establish an exact mapping between fci and fqh states . while a cylindrical geometry was employed in ref .",

    "more specifically , in this paper we will focus on @xmath32 systems .",
    "moreover , for finite @xmath18 , it is necessary to generalize the definition of a berry s phase gauge field and chern number to the case of @xmath26 with a discrete @xmath19 variable .",
    "we start from the definition of 1d wannier states @xmath33 which is a fourier transform of @xmath26 in the @xmath6-direction , but which remains an eigenstate of @xmath34 . since the state @xmath26 is only determined by the hamiltonian up to a phase , the phase factor @xmath35 is not pre - determined . as was discussed in refs .",
