    "neutron stars with be companions accrete material from the slow , dense , stellar outflow thought to be confined to the equatorial plane of the be star .",
    "cep x4 has recently been associated with a be star of magnitude v=14.2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) that lies within the _ rosat _ error circle ( @xcite ) .",
    "this association is based upon positional coincidence , strong h-@xmath6 and h-@xmath7 emission lines ( typical of be / x - ray binaries ) , and measurement of the optical absorption column density which is in good agreement with _ rosat _ measurements .",
    "the companion is most likely a b1v - b2ve star at a distance of 3.8@xmath80.6 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "cep x4 was discovered with _",

    "gs 2138 + 56 was later identified with cep x4 because it fell in the 0.4  error box and had a similar spectrum .",
    "pulsations at a frequency of 15.09457 @xmath8 0.00002 mhz ( mjd 47,263.5 ) were detected during a month long outburst which peaked at about 100 mcrab ( 1 - 20 kev ) in early april 1988 .",

    "is 10 times larger than the spin - down rate between the first two outbursts .",
    "apparent spin - up observed during the first two outbursts and spin - down in the recent outburst may be intrinsic or due to binary orbital motion .    in this paper",
    "we present observations of two outbursts from cep x4 in 1993 and 1997 .",
    "our observations with batse include histories of pulse frequency , pulsed flux , and average 20 - 50 kev pulse profiles .",

    "rxte _ proportional counter array ( pca ) data from 1997 july 18 & 25 , after batse stopped detecting cep x4 .",
    "we present pulse frequency measurements , pulse profiles , and power spectra from these data .",
    "three different instruments spanning energies from 2 - 1800 kev were used to study cep x4 : batse on _ cgro _ , and the pca and asm both on _ rxte_. batse consists of eight identical uncollimated detector modules positioned on the corners of the _ cgro _ spacecraft such that the normal vectors of the detectors are perpendicular to the faces of a regular octahedron , providing all - sky coverage .",

    "averaged data from the full 2 - 12 kev band .",
    "histories of pulse frequency and pulsed flux ( 20 - 50 kev ) were determined on 2-day intervals of batse discla data .",

    "background variations observed in these intervals were at low frequencies relative to the cep x4 s pulse frequency .",
    "deviations from the constant background model resulted in low frequency noise well outside the search range used which did not affect pulse frequency measurements .",
    "batse data from 1991 april to 1997 december were searched for outbursts from cep x4 using the pulse frequency and flux estimation method described in section [ sec : tech ] .",
    "two outbursts , each lasting about 2 weeks were detected in the batse data : the first from 1993 june 20 - july 6 ( mjd",

    "also shown is the pulsed flux history from 20 - 50 kev batse data and the phase averaged flux from _ rxte _ asm data . to determine the pulse frequencies from the pca data , standard 1 ( 125 ms , no energy resolution ) data from 1997 july 18 ( mjd 50,647 ) and 1997 july 25 ( mjd 50,654 )",
    "were used with techniques described in section  [ sec : tech ] .",
    "we found that the scatter in frequency measurements for different values of the number of fourier coefficients , @xmath31 ( see section  [ sec : tech ] ) , was much larger than expected for poisson noise .",
    "the best fit frequencies , with errors corrected for aperiodic noise ( described below ) , were 15.088@xmath80.004 mhz ( @xmath35 ) on july 18 ( mjd 50,647 ) and 15.088@xmath80.003 mhz ( @xmath35 ) on july 25 ( mjd 50,654 ) .",
    "excess aperiodic noise from cep x4 was likely the cause of the observed scatter in our frequency measurements , so we performed power spectral analyses on about 2000  s of good xenon data from 1997 july 18 and about 2400  s from july 25 to search for aperiodic variability .",
    "these data were binned into 125 ms time bins containing no gaps .",
    "the background in these intervals was modeled using pcabackest , which estimates the background from standard  2 data at 16 second intervals .",
    "this model was then interpolated to 125 ms resolution by polynomial fitting .",
    "power due to the 66  s pulsations was removed by subtracting a model consisting of a 14th degree fourier expansion in the best fit pulse frequency .",
    "next a fourier transform with no oversampling was performed on the background subtracted data .",
    "the fourier coefficients @xmath36 are given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the total counts and background counts in bin @xmath40 , @xmath41 the number of measurement bins , and @xmath42 . equation ( 1 ) in morgan & remillard ( 1997 ) was used to calculate the dead - time corrected poisson level with a time bin size of @xmath43  ms , a dead - time per event of @xmath44s , and a dead - time window per very large event ( vle ) of @xmath45s . in the normalization of leahy et al . ( 1983 ) , given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the total number of photons , the poisson level is @xmath48 for purely poisson noise .",
    "these calculations yielded average dead - time corrected poisson levels of @xmath49 for july 18 and @xmath50 for july 25 .",
    "the aperiodic noise at the pulse frequency and its harmonics was estimated by averaging the source power , @xmath51 , in the region @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the pulse frequency ( n=1 ) and @xmath54 ( n=2,3 , ... ) are the harmonics of the pulse frequency .",
    "this power was then compared to the average dead - time corrected poisson level , @xmath55 for each region .",
    "the errors on the frequency measurements , @xmath56,listed above and shown in figure  [ fig : cepx4_97 ] include a correction due to this excess aperiodic noise , given by @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the error expected for poisson noise only .",
    "next , we wished to measure the rms variation of the aperiodic noise component .",
    "we renormalized the power such that the fractional rms variation in source intensity over a given frequency range is related to the integral of the power in that range , i.e. @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the variance on the source count rate due to the frequency range @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 is the mean source count rate .",
    "the power spectrum was then calculated by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the duration of the data and @xmath65 is the total source counts in bin @xmath40 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pow ] shows the power spectra , plotted as fractional power per logarithmic frequency interval , from 1997 july 18 in the top panel and july 25 in the bottom panel . in these units , a @xmath66 power law is a horizonal line .",
    "aperiodic variability is present in both time intervals , with an rms variation of 17 - 19% ( @xmath670.01 - 1 hz ) for both days . in the 1988 outburst , _ ginga _ observed aperiodic noise with an rms variation of about 6% for the same frequency interval .",
    "the source was apparently noisier in _ rxte _ observations .",
    "clearly evident in figure  [ fig : pow ] is the presence of considerable low frequency noise on 1997 july 25 ( bottom panel ) which is not present in the top panel .",
    "we compared variations in the pulsed flux , mean background subtracted flux , and the background model ( generated using pcabackest ) to determine if these features were intrinsic to cep x4 .",
    "the unpulsed flux and pulsed flux for july 25 were measured by fitting a constant plus a 14 harmonic fourier expansion in the best - fit pulse frequency to intervals exactly 2 pulse periods long .",
    "the background model was binned at the same resolution and subtracted from the unpulsed flux .",
    "the variations observed in the unpulsed flux prior to background subtraction were about 3 - 4 times the background model variations .",
    "figure  [ fig:2period ] shows the background model , the background subtracted unpulsed flux , and the pulsed flux .",
    "the background subtracted unpulsed flux ( denoted by the solid histogram ) and pulsed flux ( denoted by the dashed histogram ) increased slowly to a broad peak , followed by a faster decrease .",
    "the background model ( denoted by the dotted line ) also slowly rose to a flat peak and then decreased , but it peaked later .",
    "the pulse fraction remained essentially constant throughout this interval , so it was unlikely that the variations observed were due to background fluctuations . on july 18 , when cep x4 was about 2 times brighter in the asm , the unpulsed and pulsed flux remained approximately constant during our observations .",
    "apparently cep x4 was less stable at lower intensities .",
    "average pulse profiles were generated by epoch - folding @xmath5 10 days of 20 - 50 kev batse cont ( 2.048 s resolution data ) for both the 1993 and 1997 outbursts .",
    "a quadratic frequency model fit to the observed frequencies in figures  [ fig : cepx4_93 ]  &  [ fig : cepx4_97 ] was used in the epoch - folding .",
    "pulse profiles from 1993 june 20 - 29 ( mjd 49,158 - 49,167 ) and 1997 july 4 - 14 ( mjd 50,633 - 50,643 ) are shown in the top and bottom panels respectively in figure  [ fig : batse_profiles ] .",
    "both profiles show a large main peak ( phase @xmath68 ) followed by smaller second peak atop a broad shoulder ( phase @xmath69 ) and a valley ( phase @xmath70 ) .",
    "pulse profiles from _ rxte _ observations were generated by epoch - folding good xenon data from 1997 july 18 and july 25 .",
    "good xenon data were binned into 125 ms bins and divided into 8 energy bands .",
    "the background in each band was estimated at 16 s intervals using pcabackest and interpolated to 125 ms resolution by polynomial fits .",
    "the background subtracted data were folded at the best fit frequencies from the fits to the standard 1 data shown in figure  [ fig : cepx4_97 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : profiles ] shows the pulse profiles from july 18 ( left hand panel ) and july 25 ( right hand panel ) .",
    "the pulse profile shows energy dependent features and considerable structure with a large main peak ( phase @xmath50.7 - 1.0 ) followed by a deep notch at low energies ( phase @xmath51.0 - 1.1 ) .",
    "the notch is followed by a second peak ( phase @xmath51.1 - 1.4 ) and a valley ( phase @xmath51.4 - 1.7 ) .",
    "the profiles evolve from double peaked , with a narrow notch between the peaks at low energy , to a dominant first peak ( phase @xmath71 ) followed by a broad shoulder .",
    "the second peak ( phase @xmath72 ) appears to be weaker relative to the first peak on july 25 than on july 18 .",
    "figure  [ fig : hardness ] is a hardness ratio for july 18 given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the average background subtracted count rate for 9 - 20 kev , @xmath75 is the mean subtracted pulse profile count rate for 9 - 20 kev , @xmath76 is the average background subtracted count rate for 2 - 6 kev , and @xmath77 is the mean subtracted profile for 2 - 6 kev .",
    "the errors shown are the errors on the difference @xmath78 , since we are interested in where the hardness ratio deviated from the mean value , 0.584@xmath80.002 .",
    "hardness ratios show that the notch is the hardest feature and that it is surrounded by a softer double lobed feature ( phase @xmath5 0.7 - 1.4 ) .",
    "similar features were also seen in hardness ratios from july 25 .",
    "however , the significance of these features was reduced by the lower intensity and smaller pulse fractions in these data .",
    "the root mean squared ( rms ) intensities for each energy band were calculated as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the background subtracted source count rate in phase bin @xmath40 , @xmath81 is the number of phase bins , and @xmath82 is the mean source count rate .",
    "rms pulse fractions , @xmath83 are shown in figure  [ fig : frac ] .",
    "the pulse fraction has considerable energy dependence and appears to be decreasing as the mean source intensity decreases .    the average 20 - 50 kev batse pulse profile from 1997 july 4 - 14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : batse_profiles ] , bottom panel ) is very similar to the 1997 july 18 pca profile in the 20 - 30 kev energy band ( fig .  [ fig : profiles ] bottom left ) .",
    "the source intensity was too low to allow detection of significant profile variations at energies @xmath84 20 kev with either instrument .",
    "_ ginga _ observed pulse shape variations with energy during the 1988 outburst .",
    "the second peak was brighter than the first at low energies ( 1 - 7 kev ) and roughly equal at higher energies ( 13 - 37 kev ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the optically identified companions for transient pulsars with periods longer than one second are all be or oe stars .",
    "recent long - term studies with batse revealed that be / x - ray binaries exhibit series of often periodic outbursts and most appear to have a long - term spin - up trend ( @xcite ) .",
    "one other system , a 1118 - 616 , may be experiencing a spin - down trend , but the duty cycle for this source , like cep x4 , is quite low .",
    "long - term spin - down in x - ray pulsars is thought to be caused by the propeller effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "simple accretion theory assumes that material from the companion star is flowing onto a rotating neutron star with a magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field is so strong that it determines the motion of the material in a region of space surrounding the neutron star called the magnetosphere .",
    "the magnetospheric radius @xmath85 , is defined to be the distance from the neutron star at which all magnetic field lines are closed loops . assuming a dipole field at large distances from the neutron star",
    ", the magnetospheric radius can be estimated by equating the magnetic energy density to the total kinetic energy density of the accreting gas .",
    "therefore from shapiro & teukolsky ( 1983 ) , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the magnetic moment of the dipole field in units of @xmath88 g @xmath89 , @xmath90 is the neutron star mass in units of @xmath91 , @xmath92 is the mass accretion rate in units of @xmath93 g s@xmath3 , and @xmath94 for disk accretion ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and @xmath95 for wind accretion ( @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath85 exceeds the corotation radius , @xmath96 , the distance from the neutron star where centrifugal forces just balance local gravity , the propeller effect is believed to occur .",
    "matter will be ejected from the magnetic field lines when the centrifugal forces exceed gravitational force .",
    "this ejected matter gains angular momentum from the pulsar , causing it to spin down .",
    "if we assume the long - term spin - down observed in this system is due to the propeller effect , then by equating the magnetospheric and co - rotation radii , we can estimate the critical mass accretion rate where the propeller effect begins @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the pulsar spin period in seconds . at this critical mass transfer rate , corbet ( 1996 )",
    "predicts a transition from neutron star accretion to magnetospheric accretion , accompanied by a large drop in luminosity . using a magnetic field estimate of @xmath99 g ( @xcite ) , a distance estimate @xmath100 kpc ( @xcite ) , a spin period of @xmath101 s , along with typical neutron star parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 cm",
    ", we estimate the minimum x - ray flux for neutron star accretion , @xmath104 erg @xmath105 s@xmath3 , and the maximum for magnetospheric accretion , @xmath106 erg @xmath105 s@xmath3 . in 1993",
    "january _ rosat _ observed a quiescent 0.1 - 2.5 kev flux level of @xmath107 erg @xmath105 s@xmath3 from cep x4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this flux level fell in the gap between @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "schulz et al . ( 1995 ) estimated that the _ rosat _ flux in the outburst in 1993 june was about 10% of the bolometric flux .",
    "assuming that the cep x4 spectrum was unchanged during the quiescent _ rosat _ observations , we estimate a quiescent bolometric flux level of @xmath110 erg @xmath105 s@xmath3 , which still falls in the gap , if we assume wind accretion ( @xmath95 ) . clearly the observed flux was near the expected value for the onset of the propeller regime .",
    "the estimated bolometric flux from the _ rosat _ observations was a factor of @xmath5 3 below the expected value for wind accretion , which implies that the spectrum was much harder at low @xmath111 , similar to a 0535 + 262 ( @xcite ) .",
    "future quiescent observations at higher energies are needed to confirm this spectral hardening . for wind accretion ,",
    "additional uncertainties in the predicted flux arise because when the propeller effect sets in at the neutron star s equator , accretion still occurs at higher latitudes . comparing the estimated bolometric flux with the predicted flux",
    "suggests that we may be observing disk accretion .",
    "however , additional uncertainties in the predicted flux arise from uncertainty in dimensionless parameter @xmath112 . in both wind and disk accretion , the validity of the assumptions used to derive the predicted flux is uncertain because the physics at the onset of the propeller effect is poorly understood .",
    "long - term studies show that be / x - ray transients exhibit two types of outbursts , giant outbursts characterized by high luminosities and high spin - up rates , and normal outbursts which typically are fainter , exhibit less intrinsic spin - up , and are spaced by some multiple of the orbital period .",
    "normal outbursts appear to be associated with peristron passage in be / x - ray transients with known orbits ( @xcite ) .",
    "the outbursts observed from cep x4 are most likely normal outbursts .",
    "therefore the spacing of the 4 outbursts constrains the orbital period .",
    "we assume that the two previous outbursts in 1972 june - july ( @xcite ) and 1988 march - april ( @xcite ) occurred at the same orbital phase ( likely near periastron ) as the two outbursts observed by batse .",
    "outburst mid - times were calculated for each observation .",
    "errors were assigned to each mid - time according to how well the mid - point of the outburst was known .",
    "an evenly spaced grid of orbital periods ranging from 25 - 10@xmath113 days was searched , minimizing the following @xmath114 : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the mid - time of outburst @xmath16 , @xmath117 is the estimated error on @xmath116 , @xmath118 is an epoch , and @xmath119 is an orbital period",
    ". a number of acceptable orbital periods , all @xmath120 147.3 days , were found . combining this result with koyama et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , implies 23 days @xmath121 days .",
    "the energy dependent pulse profile of cep x4 in figure  [ fig : profiles ] consists of two peaks separated by a narrow valley at low energies ( @xmath122 kev ) which becomes filled in as the energy increases , until the leading peak ( phase @xmath5 0.7 - 1.0 ) becomes dominant at energies above roughly 9 kev .",
    "this energy dependent behavior can be interpreted as the sum of two pulse components : a softer double lobed component that occupies pulse phase @xmath5 0.7 to 1.4 in figure  [ fig : profiles ] and a narrower harder peak centered at phase @xmath5 1.05 that is offset towards the leading peak of the softer double lobed component .",
    "the relationship between the two components is well illustrated by the hardness ratio shown in figure  [ fig : hardness ] .",
    "this energy dependent behavior is quite similar to that observed in her x-1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a possible interpretation of this energy dependent behavior can be made using a cyclotron backscattering scenario . in this scenario",
    "the outward bound x - rays from a given magnetic pole are divided into two main components : a hard pencil beam directed along the accretion column and an antipodally directed fan beam of backscattered radiation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fan beam is produced by outward bound photons that travel up through the accretion column until their energy equals the local cyclotron resonance energy whence they are backscattered .",
    "the backscattered photons will either strike the neutron star surface or be focused around the neutron star forming an antipodal fan beam .",
    "softer photons scatter from higher altitudes in the accretion column and hence a smaller fraction of the backscattered photons are intercepted by the neutron star surface than is the case for the harder photons that scatter at lower altitudes .",
    "therefore , the antipodal fan beam lobes produced by the softer photons will be wider , i.e. more  filled in \" than the lobes produced by harder photons . at even higher energies , near the surface cyclotron energy and above , most photons",
    "will not be backscattered and will escape forming a pencil beam .",
    "for an appropriate angle of the magnetic axis to the spin axis and an observer positioned with a line - of - sight to the neutron star near the spin latitude of the magnetic dipole axis , a pulse profile consisting of a single hard pencil beam filling in the center of a softer fan beam from the antipodal pole will be observed .",
    "a simple beam model consisting of a pencil beam surrounded by a backscattered fan beam was constructed to explore possible pulse profiles illustrative of a cyclotron scattering model .",
    "the pencil beam is represented by an emitting point on the neutron star surface and has a gaussian beam profile .",
    "similarly , the fan beam is represented by an emitting point above the neutron star surface that is at the apex of a conical beam pointed toward the neutron star and has a gaussian profile for the conical beam  walls \" .",
    "gravitational light bending effects are taken into account by calculating photon trajectories from that height . in figure",
    "[ fig : pulsemod ] we show an example profile that is reminiscent of the cep x4 profile .",
    "the five panels on the left represent the pulse profile in five different energy bands .",
    "the panels on the right show the apparent locations of the emitting point when the beams are visible .",
    "the height @xmath123 of the fan beam emitting point decreases with increasing energy as @xmath124 kev where @xmath125 is the cyclotron scattering energy , @xmath126 is the surface magnetic field strength in units of @xmath127 gauss and @xmath128 is the radius of the neutron star .",
    "sharp drops in the fan beam emission occur when the beam intersects the neutron star surface .",
    "use of a more realistic extended emission region rather than a point would smooth out these sharp drops.the pencil beam increases in strength relative to the fan beam with increasing energy and contributes the shaded area to the pulse profile . the observer is positioned such that only a single pencil beam is visible from one magnetic pole while only the fan beam from the opposite pole is visible .",
    "the pole emitting the pencil beam has been offset slightly to move the pulse phase centroid of the resulting pulse profile with respect to the pulse profile contributed by the fan beam .",
    "this is done to simulate the asymmetry observed in the cep x4 profile .",
