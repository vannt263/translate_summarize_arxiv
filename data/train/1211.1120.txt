    "understanding the structure and dynamics of a galaxy crucially depends on the knowledge of the three dimensional stellar distribution function ( df ) , which is not a direct observable .",
    "the first few moments of the df , e.g. , density , mean velocity and the velocity dispersion tensor together can provide important clues regarding the dynamical state of the galaxy and the gravitational instabilities it might have undergone @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the buckling instability of a stellar bar in a disk galaxy and the subsequent formation of a boxy / peanut bulge @xcite .",
    "a bar buckles under its own self - gravity when it becomes sufficiently strong , thereby bringing substantial changes in the velocity distribution of stars and the galactic potential .",
    "one possible way to quantify such a change is to study the structure and evolution of the stellar velocity ellipsoid during the buckling instability and to provide potential diagnostic observables . in particular , how is the tilt of the velocity ellipsoid related to the boxy / peanut bulge such as presented in the milky way @xcite .",
    "this requires , however , an unambiguous identification of the buckling event that a galaxy might be experiencing .",
    "however , the onset of buckling instability is not clearly understood because it is difficult to follow the orbits of stars subject to a rapidly changing gravitational potential during the buckling . during this transient phase the dynamics",
    "is strongly collective and an orbit decomposition can only be a partial description of the process .",
    "nevertheless , numerous simulation studies marked this event by a decrease in the bar strength or in the ratio of vertical - to - radial velocity dispersion ( @xmath0 ) @xcite , providing a gross understanding of this event .",
    "simulations show that often such demarcation is blurred and a more precise indicator of this event would be useful and complementary to the already existing ideas .",
    "it is worth re - investigating the buckling instability and the relation it might have with the orientation of the stellar velocity ellipsoid , in particular with the tilt angle .",
    "the shape and orientation of the stellar velocity ellipsoid are tightly connected to the symmetry of the underlying galaxy potential @xcite . in a stationary , axisymmetric disk galaxy the stellar velocity ellipsoid in the galactic midplane is perfectly aligned with the galactocentric coordinate axes , in other words , all the off - diagonal elements of the velocity dispersion tensor are zero @xcite .",
    "thus , measuring the off - diagonal components of the dispersion tensor in observation may provide one with an inference about the presence of non - axisymmetric features in a galaxy . away from the galactic midplane ,",
    "the tilt of the velocity elliposid might depend on the mass distribution of the galactic disc as well as the flattening of the dark matter halo . in the context of the milky way ,",
    "the analysis of the rave survey data release 2 @xcite shows that the velocity ellipsoid is tilted towards the galactic plane @xcite and has been nicely demonstrated in a recent paper by @xcite .",
    "however , the measured tilt angles can not put a strong constraint on the disc parameters and halo flattening due to large proper motion errors and small sample size in the rave dr2 @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "non - axisymmetric structures such as bars , spiral arms in disk galaxies might play an important role in accounting for the observed orientation of the stellar velocity ellipsoid .",
    "numerical study by @xcite shows that the vertex deviation of the velocity ellipsoid is globally correlated to the amplitude of the spiral arms . using hipparcos data and dynamical modeling ,",
    "@xcite has shown how the galactic bar @xcite could have influenced the velocity distribution in the solar neighborhood . the observed low - velocity streams in the solar neighborhood",
    "are also thought to have arisen due to the galactic bar @xcite .",
    "it would be useful to understand how the presence of a bar or spiral arms which are highly time dependent would change the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "we use n - body simulations to follow the evolution of the stellar velocity ellipsoid in a galaxy which undergoes bar instability and forms a boxy bulge during the secular evolution in a self - consistent way .",
    "the buckling of the bar causes the morphological evolution of the disk , converting its central parts into a boxy / peanut bulge . in order to gain further insight into the physics of bar buckling @xcite",
    ", we investigate the role of anisotropic stellar pressure and show that there is a characteristic signature in the way the stellar velocity ellipsoid evolves .",

    "the disk in this model did not form a b / p bulge by that time .",
    "a thorough understanding of the buckling instability would perhaps require a tool combining the orbital analysis and collective effect of the stars in the disk and their role at the @xmath39 vertical inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) . in order to pinpoint the location of the ilr , corotation resonances ( cr ) , we first compute the disk frequencies ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) by a direct sum of the first and second derivatives of the @xmath43-body potential obtained from the reflection symmetrized particle distribution with respect to the @xmath44 plane and the @xmath45 rotation axis .",

    "a stellar disk is stable against the low order ( e.g. , @xmath49 ) bending perturbation and the self - gravity of the perturbation acts like a stabilizing agent as shown by several authors , e.g. , toomre ( 1966 ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "contrary to collisional fluids , collisionless fluids may develop long range correlations which are not captured by a purely local description .",
    "the distinction between kinematic based and spatial mass distribution based instabilities in collisionless system has been presented by @xcite .",
    "a fire - hose instability belongs to instabilities depending on a strong gradient in the velocity part of the df , while a bar buckling instability belongs to instabilities mainly related to the presence of a strong resonance , which is determined by the spatial mass distribution .    in this section , we investigate the role played by the shear stress , in particular , the meridional component ( @xmath52 ) which exerts a torque in the vertical direction on an imaginary cube of the stellar fluid .",
    "first , we quantify the buckling amplitude ( @xmath53 ) by computing the @xmath54 fourier component in the @xmath55 plane of the disk with the major axis of the bar aligned to the disk major axis and identify the buckling phase by studying the time evolution of @xmath53 . during the the buckling phase @xmath53 reaches a peak value and sometimes goes through a second buckling @xcite . in fig .",

    "as the bar evolves through the buckling phase , the disk midplane also responds and exhibits a characteristic buckling mode .",
    "we compute the location of the disk midplane using the following formula to follow the buckling :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the volume density distribution of stars .",

    ", we discuss the orientation of the stellar velocity ellipsoid in the meridional plane ( @xmath69 plane ) of the galactic disk .",
    "since the buckling instability creates an asymmetry in the vertical density distribution and assuming it preserves reflection symmetry with respect to the galactic centre , we consider only one half of the meridional plane for the computation of the stellar velocity ellipsoid . when the bar has formed , we rotate it so that its major axis is perpendicular to the line - of - sight ; in other words , the tilt is calculated in the meridional plane containing the bar major axis . in edge - on projection ,",

    "<S> it is shown that the onset of a bar buckling instability is closely connected to the maximum meridional tilt of the stellar velocity ellipsoid . </S>",
    "<S> our findings bring new insight to this complex gravitational instability of the bar which complements the buckling instability studies based on orbital models . </S>",
