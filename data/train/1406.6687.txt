    "galaxies grow hierarchically within dark matter halos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , a quantitative verification of this model has met with extensive challenges , particularly on galaxy scales and smaller .",
    "for instance , comparisons between the number of subhalos seen in numerical simulations and the number of milky way or m31 dwarf galaxies show a factor of @xmath8100 discrepancy .",
    "further , kinematic studies of the most luminous local group dwarfs indicate that their densities are lower than those of simulated halos of the same mass .",
    "these small - scale tests of @xmath7cdm galaxy formation models have been mostly confined to substructure around the milky way and m31 .",
    "two spiral galaxy halos in a loose group do not sample the full spectrum of galaxy masses , morphologies and environments necessary to have a complete picture of galaxy assembly . in particular , we need to determine whether the local group just happens to be an outlier in terms of its faint dwarf galaxy population , or if substructure in other galaxies presents similar tension with @xmath7cdm .",
    "pioneering studies of other galaxies have begun , including resolved stellar population work in m81 @xcite and low surface brightness searches out to larger distances ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this work , we present the discovery of the faint dwarf galaxy scl - mm - dw1 , the first result of a new survey to study faint substructure around ngc  253 ( a star - bursting spiral galaxy in the sculptor group ) and ngc  5128 ( the dominant elliptical galaxy in the centaurus a group ) in order to broaden our observational knowledge of faint substructure beyond the local group . in ",
    "[ sec : survey_desc ] , we briefly summarize the strategy for our panoramic imaging survey of nearby galaxies .",

    "we discuss and conclude in   [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "we have begun the panoramic imaging survey of centaurus and sculptor ( pisces ) , a resolved stellar survey of two of our nearest massive galaxy neighbors ngc 253 and ngc 5128to search for archaeological remnants of their buildup via tidal streams and satellite dwarf galaxies down to @xmath9 mag .",
    "the most recent surveys in these galaxies for dwarf galaxy companions relied on photographic plates , and suffered from incompleteness fainter than @xmath6@xmath0@xmath414 mag @xcite . our goal is to survey each galaxy out to @xmath10=150 kpc to allow a direct comparison with the pandas survey in m31 @xcite , and recent work around the milky way .    to accomplish this ambitious task",
    ", we are utilizing the megacam instrument @xcite , which has a total field of view of @xmath024@xmath1124 at the @xmath12/5 focus on the magellan clay telescope .",
    "the outer survey radius of @xmath0150 kpc amounts to @xmath021 square degrees on the sky for ngc  253/ngc  5128 ( both at @xmath1@xmath03.5 mpc ) , for a total of @xmath0130 megacam pointings for each halo . in rough accordance with previous dwarf galaxy discoveries in the sculptor group , we will label our new dwarfs numerically starting with scl - mm - dw1 , where the  mm \" denotes the magellan / megacam instrumentation utilized by our program .",
    "imaging is done in two bands , @xmath13 and @xmath10 , chosen for survey speed and so that new dwarf candidates can be clearly identified and initial properties ( e.g. distance , size , approximate star formation history , and luminosity ) ascertained from their resolved stellar populations during the course of the survey . at the distance to ngc  253/ngc  5128 , the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) is at @xmath10@xmath024.5 mag ; our simulations suggested that reaching @xmath6@xmath0@xmath48 dwarf galaxies requires imaging depths of @xmath10,@xmath13@xmath026.5 mag ( to be presented in a forthcoming work ) . in good seeing conditions ( @xmath1408 ) , this requires 30 minutes of integration in each band .    during the fall 2012",
    "observing season , we identified a clear dwarf galaxy candidate around ngc  253 using data taken with poor seeing .",
    "new , deeper observations were taken in fall 2013 , in much better seeing conditions ( 0506 ; figure  [ fig : dwarf ] ) .",
    "this new dwarf galaxy , which we dub scl - mm - dw1 , is @xmath065 kpc away from the center of ngc  253 in projection .",
    "scl - mm - dw1 is just visible in digital sky survey archival images , but at a level where a detection is not secure , especially due to the presence of a handful of bright foreground stars and background galaxies in its vicinity .",
    "the data presented in this paper were taken on 2013 september 2 and 7 ( ut ) with magellan / megacam .",
    "photometric conditions were variable , but the seeing was excellent .",
    "the final stacked images consisted of 15@xmath11300s images in both the @xmath13 and @xmath10 band , with image point spread functions ( psfs ) of 0506 .",
    "initial data reduction , including standard image detrending , astrometric matching and stacking is performed by the smithsonian astrophysical observatory telescope data center utilizing a code developed by m. conroy , j. roll and b. mcleod .",
    "stellar photometry on the final image stacks was performed using a methodology similar to that of previous work utilizing magellan / megacam for resolved stellar studies @xcite with the daophotii / allstar package @xcite .",
    "our fall 2013 data of scl - mm - dw1 were not taken in photometric conditions , and so we utilized data taken in fall 2012 of the same field in clear conditions ( but poor seeing ) to calibrate the presented data .",
    "we convert instrumental magnitudes into the sdss photometric system by observing fields covered by sdss at different airmasses during clear nights , which allowed for an atmospheric extinction term to be measured .",
    "zeropoints and color terms were similar to our previous work with magellan / megacam @xcite .",
    "once the fall 2013 data was calibrated , we performed a series of artificial star tests ( utilizing the daophot routine addstar ) to calculate our photometric errors and completeness as a function of magnitude and color for the field . since crowding is not an issue ,",
    "artificial stars were placed into our images on a regular grid whose spacing was several times that of the stellar psf . over ten iterations , we injected @xmath06@xmath1110@xmath15 artificial stars into our data , covering a @xmath10-band magnitude range of 18 to 30 and a @xmath16 color of @xmath40.5 to 2.0 . using the exact same photometric pipeline as was used on the unaltered data ,",
    "we find a 50% ( 90% ) percent completeness level at @xmath10=25.6 ( 24.4 ) and @xmath13=26.5 ( 25.3 ) .",
    "these limits are slightly shallower than our ultimate goals due to the sky conditions ; data taken on clear , good - seeing nights do hit our magnitude targets as described in ",
    "[ sec : survey_desc ] .",
    "there is no indication that the unresolved light from scl - mm - dw1 changes our completeness or uncertainties in that region .",
    "our final catalog was corrected for galactic extinction @xcite , and all magnitudes reported in the remainder of this paper will be corrected in this way .",
    "figure  [ fig : dwarf ] shows our color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of scl - mm - dw1 , where the error bars show the typical magnitude and color uncertainty at different @xmath10-band magnitude levels , and a @xmath16 of 0.8 mag .",
    "in this section , we determine the basic properties of scl - mm - dw1 .",
    "we lead the discussion with its stellar populations , as these are critical for the subsections that follow : the distance , structure , and luminosity of the newly discovered dwarf .",
    "close inspection of the cmd as seen in figure  [ fig : dwarf ] hints at two interpretations for the stellar population and approximate distance to scl - mm - dw1 , and we critically assess each here .    the first scenario  which we ultimately argue against  places scl - mm - dw1 nearer than the nominal distance to ngc  253 ( with a difference in distance modulus of @xmath17@xmath00.6 mag ) at @xmath18@xmath027.1 mag ( @xmath1=2.6 mpc ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : cmd_close ] . in the left panel of figure  [ fig : cmd_close ]",
    "we over - plot a 10 gyr , [ fe / h]=@xmath42.0 theoretical isochrone @xcite at this distance , showing a reasonable match to the overdensity of stars .",
    "however , if true , the morphology of the rgb would be odd , as there appears to be a gap in the stellar luminosity function at @xmath10@xmath1924.5 mag and a color of @xmath16@xmath190.8 mag . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : cmd_close ] we plot a luminosity function of stars consistent with the rgb of this  nearby \" scenario , along with a sample of luminosity functions of random , equal - area fields in the same megacam pointing .",
    "it is clear that the number of stars in the gap is consistent with being a foreground population , but the secondary peak in the luminosity function at @xmath10@xmath024 mag is statistically significant .",
    "an rgb luminosity function would not have such a gap , which suggests that the true dwarf distance is further away , and that the secondary peak is not the trgb , but a different stellar population associated with the dwarf .",
    "this leads to the second scenario , where scl - mm - dw1 is consistent with being at the distance of ngc  253 ( we directly measure the distance to scl - mm - dw1 via its trgb in   [ sec : distance ] ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : cmd_right ] , where we over - plot a 13 gyr , [ fe / h]=@xmath20 theoretical isochrone ( in blue ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , along with two younger isochrones of 400 and 630 myr ( purple and orange , respectively ) and [ fe / h]=@xmath41.0 ( here we use the isochrones of * ? ? ?",
    "* as special attention was paid to the agb stellar population ) . in this case ,",
    "the old rgb is consistent with the main peak in the luminosity function , at roughly the distance of ngc  253 , while the secondary peak could be from a younger , agb stellar population of @xmath0500 myr .",
    "we are confident that at least some of the stars in this secondary peak in the cmd / luminosity function are associated with scl - mm - dw1 because they appear to be spatially clustered as the rgb stars are . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : cmd_right ] , we show a spatial map of stars consistent with the rgb and agb stellar populations in this scenario .",
    "both populations show a clear overdensity at the position of the dwarf , reaffirming their significance .",
    "only a broad view of the stellar population in scl - mm - dw1 can be gleaned from the current data set .",
    "overall , the cmd of scl - mm - dw1 is consistent with an old ( @xmath310 gyr ) , metal poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath0@xmath42 ) stellar population at roughly the distance to ngc  253 ( see   [ sec : distance ] ) , with evidence for a younger ( @xmath0500 myr ) stellar population as well .",
    "a low level of even more recent star formation could also be present , but would not be detected given our current image depths .",
    "a similar cmd morphology ( with an rgb , ` gap ' and second brighter stellar population ) is often seen in the literature for other dwarfs .",
    "indeed , inspection of the cmd compilation of @xcite shows several dwarfs with a similar morphology ( including ddo44/kk61 , kdg2/e540 - 30 , and kdg61/kk81 ) where an old rgb stellar population exists with a younger agb stellar population .",
    "deeper optical and near - infrared imaging will be able to further constrain scl - mm - dw1 s stellar population .",
    "we measure the distance of scl - mm - dw1 with the trgb method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for metal - poor populations ,",
    "the trgb has a constant @xmath21-band absolute magnitude , making it a widely used distance indicator .",
    "however , to our best knowledge there is no empirical trgb calibration for sdss bands ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we thus adopt the dartmouth stellar evolutionary models @xcite and derive the theoretical absolute trgb magnitude in @xmath10-band using isochrones with a fixed age of 12  gyr and metallicities ranging from [ fe / h]@xmath22 to @xmath23 , obtaining @xmath24 .",
    "we apply a sobel edge - detection filter @xcite to the luminosity function of scl - mm - dw1 with a color cut of @xmath25 , in order to minimize contamination from background galaxies and foreground stars .",
    "the resulting value is @xmath26 , which translates into a distance modulus of @xmath27=@xmath28 with our trgb calibration .",
    "the uncertainties reflect the photometric errors and the sparseness of the luminosity function . as a test",
    ", we also compute @xmath29 for all stars in the megacam pointing not belonging to scl - mm - dw1 , i.e. , probable ngc  253 halo stars .",
    "we find @xmath30 which gives a distance modulus of @xmath27=@xmath31 .",
    "the excellent agreement with literature estimates for the distance of ngc  253 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * who found @xmath27=27.70@xmath20.07 ) confirms the robustness of our adopted calibration .",
    "we conclude that scl - mm - dw1 lies at approximately the same distance as ngc  253 within the uncertainties .      despite its distance and relatively small number of resolved stars",
    ", we can determine many of the structural parameters of scl - mm - dw1 through standard methods .",
    "we use a maximum likelihood technique for constraining structural parameters , based on the recipe of @xcite , and identical to that done in @xcite .",
    "we cut out a 10@xmath1110 arcmin@xmath32 region around the approximate center of the dwarf for use in our calculations .",
    "the stars selected for the structural analysis are those in the boxed regions of figure  [ fig : cmd_right ] ( left panel ) , corresponding to the rgb and agb star candidates in scl - mm - dw1 .",
    "we fit a standard exponential profile plus constant background to the data , with the following free parameters : the central position ( @xmath33,@xmath34 ) , position angle ( pa ; @xmath35 ) , ellipticity ( @xmath36 ) , half - light radius ( @xmath5 ) and background surface density ( @xmath37 ) . uncertainties on structural parameters were determined via bootstrap resamples , from which 68% confidence limits were calculated .",
    "our results are presented in table  [ table : properties ] .",
    "the half light radius of scl - mm - dw1 is 340@xmath250 pc , which is comparable to the size of the mw s classical dwarf spheroidals .",
    "the central position of scl - mm - dw1 is also well constrained .",
    "the ellipticity ( and thus position angle ) of scl - mm - dw1 is not well constrained , and our maximum likelihood analysis can provide only an upper limit of @xmath36@xmath380.42 ( 95% confidence limit ) , due to the sparse number of stars inferred to be scl - mm - dw1 members ( @xmath0100 ) in the current data set .",
    "we estimate scl - mm - dw1 s luminosity directly from aperture photometry .",
    "we use an aperture radius equal to the half - light radius ( 168 ) , and randomly place 100 equal - area apertures throughout our megacam field of view to estimate the background .",
    "this method has the advantage that it should both account for the clear background galaxies ( and foreground stars ) in our scl - mm - dw1 aperture in a statistical sense , as well as any halo ngc  253 stars .",
    "since by definition an aperture equal to the half - light radius only includes half of the flux from the dwarf , we correct the dwarf flux by a factor of two . using this methodology we find @xmath39=@xmath410.0@xmath20.5 and @xmath40=@xmath410.5@xmath20.6 , where the uncertainty on the luminosity was found based on the scatter in measurements from the 100 background apertures , as well as the uncertainty in our measured distance modulus ( see   [ sec : distance ] ) . to convert from @xmath40 , @xmath39 magnitudes to @xmath6",
    ", we use the filter transformation equations of @xcite , and find @xmath6=@xmath410.3@xmath20.6 .",
    "we have presented the discovery of scl - mm - dw1 , a faint dwarf galaxy found @xmath065 kpc in projection from ngc  253 .",
    "its inferred distance ( 3.9@xmath20.5 mpc ) matches ngc  253 itself , making a physical association likely .",
    "the stellar population of scl - mm - dw1 is complex , with an rgb consistent with an old , metal poor stellar population ( @xmath810 gyr ; [ fe / h]@xmath0@xmath42 ) and agb stars with an age of @xmath0500 myr .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among many others ) , so an improved distance to the dwarf would be of significant interest .",
