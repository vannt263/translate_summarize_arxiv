    "cosmological observations of the last decade surely assert that the main part of the energy density of the universe  more than 70%  belongs to the unknown essence , called  dark energy  .",
    "its cosmological mission is to provide the accelerated expansion of the universe , revealed from exploration of sn ia s in the distant galaxies and temperature fluctuation power spectrum of cosmic microwave background .",
    "the cosmological @xmath4cdm - model , based on the einstein equations with cosmological constant ( see @xcite and references therein ) , describes very well almost whole set of the observational data on dynamics of expansion of the universe and formation of its large - scale structure .",
    "but physical interpretation of the cosmological constant is rather problematic @xcite . therefore alternative approaches  new physical fields ( classical scalar field ",
    "quintessence , tachyon field , k - essence , phantom field , quintom field ) , chaplygin gas , gravity and general relativity modifications , multidimensional gravity , branes and others  are intensively analysed ( see reviews @xcite and special issue of gen .",
    "gravit . , 2008 , v.40 ) now .",
    "up to now none of them has crucial preferability from observational or theoretical point of view . therefore each of them must be comprehensively studied . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to quintessential scalar fields with classical lagrangian @xmath9 in the dark energy  matter dominated universe .",
    "the quintessence model can be defined by setting of the appropriate potential @xmath10 or equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath11 .",
    "there is a dozen or more physically - motivated shapes of the potential @xmath10 : exponential , double exponential , exponential with inverse power , power - law , etc .",
    "the dynamics of such scalar fields is intensively studied ( see review @xcite ) .",
    "the eos parameter of dark energy completely defines the background dynamics as well as the evolution of cosmological perturbations @xcite . since observational data on sn ia magnitude",
    "redshift relation and cosmic microwave anisotropy give relatively narrow ranges of dark energy density and eos parameter values , it looks quite attractive to establish the potential @xmath10 using these data and analyse the background dynamics and perturbative properties of such scalar field which are not studied widely enough .    in our previous papers",
    "we have constructed the potentials of scalar fields with classical and tachyonic lagrangian leading to the constant eos parameter @xmath12 @xcite and analysed the background dynamics and perturbative properties of such scalar fields @xcite .",
    "it was shown that cosmological model with cold dark matter and such types of the scalar field ( @xmath13-model ) agrees slightly better with the accessible today observable data than the @xmath4cdm - model . but",
    "difference of quantitative merits of goodness is not large enough to pick out one of them at confidential level of @xmath14 .",
    "since the degeneracies between model parameters of dark energy and cosmological parameters @xcite exist for the background dynamics , the complete analysis of linear density perturbations in both dark matter and dark energy components is important for improvement of dark energy observational tests . among the large number of free quintessence parameters and unknown initial values of quintessence perturbation modes there is only small part of models , for which the evolution of perturbations has been studied .",
    "the general conclusion is that magnitudes of dark energy density perturbations on scales smaller than horizon are essentially lower than corresponding magnitudes of matter density ones .",
    "but character of their evolution depends strongly on the scalar field model ( its potential , time variation of eos parameter , sound speed , etc . ) , initial conditions , scale of perturbations and gauge ( see for example @xcite ) .    here",
    "the special attention should be paid to the eos parameter of dark energy @xmath15 , which can be constant or varying in time .",
    "the temporal variation of the dark energy eos parameter is often presented by linear fitting formula with two @xcite or three @xcite parameters to be estimated .",
    "other functional dependences of @xmath16 on scale factor or redshift can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we study the parametrization of the equation of state , which needs only 1 additional quantity with clear physical meaning  the adiabatic speed of sound @xmath17 ( the analysis of generalized dark sector components can be found in the early works @xcite ) . in general , @xmath18 is the unknown function of time .",
    "however , taking into account the simplicity we restrict ourselves to @xmath19 , so it is regarded only as the second physical parameter defining the equation of state of dark energy ( the first one  the present value of @xmath16 ) .    in this paper",
    "we undertake the comparative analysis the evolution of gauge - invariant variables of the scalar perturbations in the model with non - relativistic matter ( @xmath20 ) and scalar field which we define by classical lagrangian with potential constructed for two cases ( @xmath12 and @xmath3 ) in the concordance cosmological models .",
    "these cases have been chosen because they allow us to obtain analytical solutions , which seems to look very attractive in the world of numerical computations .",
    "we assume the adiabatic initial conditions for matter and dark energy scalar perturbations .",
    "we consider the homogeneous and isotropic flat universe with metric of 4-space @xmath21 where the factor @xmath22 is the scale factor , normalized to 1 at the current epoch @xmath23 , @xmath24 is conformal time ( @xmath25 ) .",

    "@xmath28 run from 0 to 3 , the greek ones  over the spatial part of the metric : @xmath29=1 , 2 , 3 .    if the universe is filled with non - relativistic matter ( cold dark matter and baryons ) and quintessence which interact only gravitationally ( minimal coupling ) then the dynamics of its expansion is completely described by the einstein equations @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the ricci tensor and @xmath32 , @xmath33  energy - momentum tensors of matter @xmath34 and quintessence @xmath35 .",
    "if these components interact only gravitationally then each of them satisfy the differential energy - momentum conservation law separately : @xmath36 ( here and below `` ; '' denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the coordinate with given index in the space with metric @xmath37 ) . for the perfect",

    "the matter is considered to be non - relativistic , so @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( here and below `` 0 '' denotes the present values ) .",
    "we assume the quintessence to be a scalar field @xmath46 with classical lagrangian @xmath47 where @xmath10 is the field potential . we suppose also the background scalar field to be homogeneous ( @xmath48 ) , so its energy density and pressure depend only on time : @xmath49 then the conservation law ( [ conserv - eq ] )",
    "gives the scalar field evolution equation ( called the klein - gordon one ) @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the hubble parameter for any moment of conformal time @xmath24 .",
    "we specify the model of quintessence using two thermodynamical parameters : the eos parameter @xmath52 and the adiabatic speed of sound @xmath53 . in general case",
    "they are connected by equation @xmath54 ( here and below we omit index @xmath0 for @xmath15 ) .",
    "if the time dependence of @xmath55 is known then @xmath18 is defined unambiguously , if @xmath18 is determined then the initial value @xmath56 must be defined additionaly , so , the eos parameter has 2 degrees of freedom : a function and a constant . for other parametrizations see @xcite . since the constraints for time dependence of @xmath55 or @xmath57",
    "are not established well we consider two simple cases : @xmath2 and @xmath58 . in the first case @xmath59 and in the second one @xmath60 this equation has obvious asymptotical behaviour : when @xmath61 @xmath62 and when @xmath63 @xmath64 .",
    "so , at early epoch the dark energy mimics dust matter ( @xmath65 ) for @xmath3 or radiation ( @xmath66 ) for @xmath67 . in future such scalar field will mimic cosmological constant ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the time dependences of eos parameter for both cases are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the equation ( [ eqconsm ] ) has the analytical solutions for two cases :    * @xmath2 : @xmath69 and * @xmath3 : @xmath70 $ ] ,    so it s possible to simplify formulae and calculations and we will analyse only this two cases now .    if the parametrization of eos parameter is given , it is possible to apply reverse engineering and construct the fields @xmath0 and potentials @xmath10 . from ( [ rho_q ] )",
    "one simply obtains : @xmath71    if the integral for @xmath0 can be expressed via functions that could be inverted to obtain @xmath72 , then @xmath73 can be easily written in analytical form .",

    "however , the physical consequences of both these solutions are the same @xcite , so from now we restrict ourselves only to the growing one .",
    "the variety of scalar field potentials was presented in @xcite .",
    "the potential for @xmath2 can be also found in @xcite , the potential for @xmath90 belongs generally to the family of double exponential potentials ( with additional constant term ) , but both they differ from the physically - motivated ones , for which the evolution of scalar linear perturbations was studied by other authors .",
    "we must note that the asymptotic behaviour at @xmath91 of the expansion rate @xmath92 and acceleration parameter @xmath93 in both cases is the same and similar to that in @xmath4cdm - model : @xmath94 , @xmath95 . at current epoch the parameters of expansion dynamics are the same ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) for both models .",
    "but their asymptotic behaviour at @xmath98 is different : in @xmath2 quintessence @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and in @xmath3 quintessence @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",

    "so , the scalar field with @xmath3 behaves as cold dark matter at the early epoch and will mimic the cosmological constant in far future .",
    "the different asymptotic behaviour of these fields is caused by their intrinsic properties . in the @xmath2 quintessence",
    "the negative pressure stiffly follows its energy density and their relation is always constant . in the @xmath3 quintessence",
