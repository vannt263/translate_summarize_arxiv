    "the intermediate silicon tracker ( ist ) is a silicon based particle detector installed at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) in the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "the detector is located in the central region of the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) experiment and makes up the third tracking layer in a 4-layer vertex detector upgrade .",
    "it is comprised 24 staves , each of which is a flexible pcb wrapped around a carbon fiber core .",
    "attached to each stave are 6 silicon sensors which can detect energetic particles which pass through them .",
    "these silicon sensors are read out by 36 analog front - end chips which are connected to an external data acquisition system .",
    "each stave holds the electrical substrate known as a `` hybrid . ''",
    "the hybrid is the flexible circuit onto which the silicon sensors , analog front - end chips , and passive components are mounted .",
    "the hybrid is permanently bonded to the stave during the stave manufacturing .",
    "the hybrid is broken up into 2 areas , the sensor area and the connector area . in the sensor area",
    "we desire as little mass as possible to reduce interactions with passing particles . for this reason , the sensor area , which makes up most of the hybrid ,",
    "is made of 2 layers of copper on a kapton substrate .",
    "the connector area is made of the same 2 layers of copper but with an additional copper layer and kapton layer . over both areas",
    "is a kapton coverlay attached with of adhesive .",
    "this coverlay has no cutouts on the bottom layer and acts as insulation between the copper and the structural material in the stave . on the top layer",
    "large areas of this cover lay are cut out around any area with bonding pads or component pads .",
    "conventional solder mask is applied to this area as shown in figure  [ fig : hybrid ] .",
    "the hybrids are finished with enepig for compatibility with both wire bonding and conventional soldering . in order to keep the copper weight down",
    ", all vias are selectively plated through .",
    "this selective plating can be seen in figure  [ fig : passive ] .",
    ", width=480 ]    each hybrid provides the electrical connection from the apv chips to the connector site on one end of the stave .",
    "electrically the hybrid is broken up into three separate circuits which share a common ground .",
    "each circuit serves 12 apv chips and 2 sensors .",
    "the apv chips require power , analog output , and control signals to be routed to each chip .",
    "the sensors require a bias line which must withstand up to .    in the sensor area",
    "we require as little mass as possible .",
    "because of this , the sensor area has only two routing layers , so careful routing was needed to optimize the power net distribution and signal distribution .",
    "the power nets are distributed as three large busses per section for , , and ground .",
    "the power supplies for the staves operate on a remote regulation scheme , so a sense net from each bus is routed locally away from the apv chips in each section and back to the connectors . for the analog output signals , a differential pair from each apv chip is routed to the connectors .",
    "the analog output is a differential current mode signal .",
    "source termination is provided at the board which plugs into the stave .",
    "in addition , the apv chips use i2c for slow controls to set various parameters of the chip .",
    "these nets are also routed as a bus to each of the chips in a section .",
    "finally , two differential pairs provide a clock and a trigger to each apv chip .",
    "these are routed as a bus to each of the chips in a section .",
    "the hybrid has 36 apv placement sites where apv chips are attached and 6 sensor placement sites where sensors are attached .",
    "the apv chips generate nearly all of the heat in the stave so an aluminum cooling tube is embedded in the stave directly beneath the apv chips as shown in figure  [ fig : cooling_tube ] . to reduce the thermal resistance ,",
    "14 vias are placed on the apv placement sites to conduct heat through the kapton core .",

    "each hybrid was assembled into a stave at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory ( lbnl ) composites shop in berkeley , california .",
    "two carbon fiber cover sheets were co - cured to a hybrid and then a carbon fiber honeycomb was glued to one side .",
    "a block of carbon foam with a channel cut in it for cooling was also glued on .",
    "the carbon foam has a lower radiation length but is homogeneous unlike the carbon fiber honeycomb .",
    "this uniformity makes it more suitable for wire bonding , so the carbon foam is located underneath any area where wire bonding will be performed .",
    "each stave nominally generates about of heat .",
    "cooling is provided by flowing a synthetic heat transfer fluid , 3m^tm^ novec^tm^ 7200 engineered fluid , through the aluminum tube which runs through the carbon foam . because the ist is installed in the central region of star , we needed a cooling fluid which would not damage the other detectors surrounding it in the event of a leak",
    ". novec has a very low vapor pressure , leaves no residue when it evaporates and has a very high resistivity , making it a good candidate .",
    "novec was chosen because it has a lower ozone - depletion potential than other engineered fluids with similar properties .",
    "other detectors using a similar design have observed galvanic corrosion between the carbon foam and the aluminum tube @xcite . in order to prevent this ,",
    "the carbon foam channel was coated with epoxy before the tube was laid in to provide a barrier .",
    "the target running temperature is which is above the dew point in the experimental hall ; this will prevent moisture from condensing on the detector which could facilitate galvanic corrosion .",
    "in addition , all parts of the stave and cooling system are electrically grounded .",
    "two end pieces called `` closeouts '' were then attached on either end of the stave .",

    "the closeouts have holes and slots to provide a way to mount the stave to the finished detector .",
    "the aluminum closeout is electrically bonded to the carbon face sheets , the carbon fiber honeycomb , and the carbon foam .",
    "this provides a means to ground the materials in the stave since they are electrically isolated from the hybrid .",
    "once everything was bonded to one of the face sheets , glue was applied to the other side and it was folded over to complete the stave . figure  [ fig : stave_assmb ] shows the stave right before this step . fully cured staves were inspected and then sent to mit for further assembly .",

    "this voltage reverse biases the pn junctions in the sensor which form the individual sensing elements ( see figure  [ fig : sensor_sch ] .",
    "particles passing through the sensor will interact with the silicon lattice and produce charge pairs which will drift apart . a capacitor above each sensing element ac couples the signal and routes it to a bonding pad located on one edge of the chip .",
    "this is a proven , standard technology for particle detection .    , width=384 ]    each sensor has 6 groups of sensing elements with 128 sensing elements in each group .",
    "a bond pad for each one of the sensing elements is grouped at one edge of the sensor and is arranged in a pattern which mirrors the bonding pattern for the apv chip ( see figure  [ fig : bonding_pads ] ) .",
    "this allows for much simpler bonding between the apv and the sensor , especially useful because the bonding pitch is so small .",
    "the sensing elements are arranged in a grid at a pitch of  @xmath0   in 64 rows and 12 columns .",

    "events in the pipeline are selected by triggers and marked for readout .",
    "a single differential pair per chip reads out each of the 128 channels in series for a selected event .",

    "figure  [ fig : apv ] shows the apv chip bonded to a stave .",
    "in addition to the sensors and apvs , a few passive components are needed on the stave .",
    "each stave has 195 additional components , mostly 0402 sized capacitors for bypassing the apv chips .",
    "in addition , there is a small temperature sensor , termination resistors for the clock and trigger lines , protection resistors for the sensor bias lines , and a connector for each section .",
    "the connectors used were the samtec tem and sem series .",
    "they provide a low mating height and high pin density which is ideal for our application .",
    "the pins are extremely fragile , however , so extreme care had to be taken during testing and assembly to reduce the number of mating cycles and prevent any connectors from being damaged .",
    "the temperature sensor used was a texas instruments tmp102 which shares the same i2c bus as the apv chips in one of the sections .",

    "proxy manufacturing in methuen , massachusetts assembled all of the staves .",
    "the assembly process was further complicated because there is no silk screen legend for most of the components on the board . because the bypass capacitors are located so close to the apv chips there was no space for a silk screen legend ( see figure  [ fig : passive ] ) . instead",
    ", the pattern of component placement was made the same for all apv placement sites and detailed documentation was produced to prevent any parts from being incorrectly placed . a visual inspection at mit after the passives were attached to the staves provided an additional quality check for such an error .",

    "during production we performed separate assembly steps for the apv chips and the silicon sensors .",
    "our production volume was limited by the silicon sensors as they were the single most expensive component to purchase and also had the longest lead time . running out of sensors late in production would have delayed installation of the full detector . to increase the overall yield , the apv chips were installed on the staves",
    "first , wire bonded , and tested to make sure they were fully functional . only after all apv chips on a stave were verified to be working properly were silicon sensors attached .",
    "the apv chips were glued directly to the hybrid using a conductive epoxy , tra - duct 2902 .",
    "a pneumatic dispenser was used to apply a uniform amount of glue for each apv chip .",
    "the glue is both thermally and electrically conductive and acts as a means to connect the back side to vss and as a means to conduct heat away from the chip .",
    "it is important that the alignment of the apv chips is precise . since there are bonding pads on all sides of the chip , both `` x '' and `` y '' alignment are important .",
    "to achieve good alignment we made custom tooling which would allow the technician to align each chip manually .",
    "the tooling provides an edge which all apv chips are pressed against to set the `` y '' alignment . then the technician aligns the bonding pads on the apv chip with copper features on the hybrid to ensure a precise alignment in `` x '' . the tooling used for this",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : apv_attach ] .",
    "this alignment step was most important because the mounted apv chips would then have to match exactly the location of the output pad sites on the silicon sensors .",
    "misalignment would make the bonding process more difficult and increase the likelihood of shorts between wire bonds .",
    "all of the alignment was done by hand under a microscope by a skilled technician .",

    "the testing station consists of a rack to hold detectors with a cosmic ray trigger inside a light - tight box ( ambient light will create noise on the sensors due to the photoelectric effect . )",
    "the staves were attached to a data acquisition system ( daq ) ( see  @xcite for more information ) which provided power and control signals and digitized the data from the apv chips . to test each stave ,",
    "it was attached to the daq and operated .",
    "noise and pedestal levels were recorded over many events and then analyzed .",
    "all staves were then sent back to mit for further work .",
    "staves that had apv chips on them which did not pass the noise and pedestal level tests had those chips removed and replaced and then sent back to bnl .",
    "the replaced apv chips were bonded and then re - tested before they were sent back to mit",
    ". staves with fully functioning apv chips then had the silicon sensors installed .",
    "the silicon sensor attachment was the final assembly step done at mit .",

    "we used this epoxy for mechanical strength and stability since the conductive epoxy is not very strong .",
    "a single line of conductive epoxy was put down and then several lines of conventional epoxy were applied to make a strong bond .",
    "we found that the working time after applying the glue was about 30 minutes after which it would be much more difficult to get the sensor to lie flat .",
