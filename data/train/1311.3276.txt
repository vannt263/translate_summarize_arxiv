    "although there exists an abundant literature on this problem , see for instance @xcite and their references , to the knowledge of the authors there is not a rigorous deduction of a pde problem satisfied by the corresponding limit density .",

    "an important case included in assumptions ( h ) is the _ contact inhibition problem _ arising in tumor modeling , see for instance chaplain et al .",
    "@xcite , i.e. that in which the initial data , describing the spatial distribution of normal and tumor tissue , satisfy @xmath146 .",
    "this free boundary problem was mathematically analyzed by bertsch et al .",
    "for one @xcite and several spatial dimensions @xcite by using regular lagrangian flow techniques . however , our approach is different and more general in some aspects , like that of the data regularity assumptions or the consideration of a drift term .",

    "we finish this section by showing some connections between the shigesada et al .",
    "model ( skt ) and the busenberg and travis model ( bt ) studied in this article .",

    "first , we observe that @xmath150 indicating that the support of diffusion for @xmath151 is , at least , equal to that of @xmath152 , and explaining the smoother behavior of solutions corresponding to @xmath151 observed in the numerical experiments",

    "although @xmath155 can not be recast in the same functional form as @xmath151 , the diffusion matrices corresponding to both flows share an important property , e.g. both give rise to a positive definite matrix once the change of unknowns @xmath156 is introduced .",

    "although we have followed this approach for the proof of theorem  [ th : existence_particular ] , we have preferred to use a direct technique to prove theorem  [ th : existence_original ] by adapting the finite element method employed by barrett and blowey @xcite which provides a convergent fully discrete numerical scheme for our numerical experiments .",

    "we proceed as mentioned in the previous section .",
    "we first replace @xmath152 by @xmath155 , see ( [ def.nlflowapp ] ) , which has similar structural properties than the flow of the skt model .",
    "then , we use the same approach as that under conditions ( h ) , and inspect the behavior of solutions when @xmath158 . in experiments 3 and 4 we present results related to the contact inhibition problem .",
    "the most interesting phenomenon is the development of discontinuities of @xmath157 in the contact point as @xmath158 , indicating a parabolic - hyperbolic transition in the behavior of solutions , as already noticed in @xcite .",
