    "recent studies of two - particle production processes @xcite where a dilute probe scatters from a dense target have shown that in order to understand saturation phenomena and the corresponding small-@xmath0 dynamics it is necessary to go beyond color dipoles and compute the appropriate evolution equations for color quadrupoles as well . in particular , the measurement of two - particle correlations in d+au collisions @xcite has attracted a fair amount of attention due to the observed suppression of the far - side peak as the rapidity of the observed particles is increased .",
    "so far , the only satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon , showing suppression for forward rapidities and not in the central rapidity region , is the calculation presented in @xcite which is performed in a color glass condensate ( cgc ) framework .",
    "even though the results of @xcite are shown to agree with the current data , it has been argued @xcite that the approximation used to implement the small-@xmath0 evolution of the relevant correlators in terms of only color dipoles is not correct even in the large-@xmath1 limit .",
    "based on the study of two - particle production processes in dis and pa collisions @xcite it is now believed that for scattering processes involving a dilute probe interacting with a dense target can be described in terms of only color dipoles and color quadrupoles in the large-@xmath1 limit .",
    "color quadrupoles have also been shown to be relevant when unintegrated gluon distributions are considered in the small-@xmath0 regime . in small-@xmath0 physics ,",
    "two different unintegrated gluon distributions @xcite ( also called transverse momentum dependent gluon distributions ) , namely the weizscker - williams gluon distribution @xmath2 @xcite and the dipole gluon distribution @xmath3 , have been found and widely used in the literature . the weizscker - williams gluon distribution , known as the conventional gluon distribution ,",
    "gives the fock space number density of gluons inside dense hadrons in light - cone gauge .",
    "the dipole gluon distribution , defined via the fourier transform of the color dipole amplitude , has been studied thoroughly since it appears in many physical processes @xcite .",
    "this dipole gluon distribution can be probed directly in photon - jet correlations measurement in pa collisions .",
    "recently , studies @xcite on the weizscker - williams gluon distribution indicate that it can be directly measured in dis dijet production and its operator definition is related to quadrupoles instead of normal color dipoles .",
    "other more complicated dijet processes in pa collisions ( e.g. , @xmath4 or @xmath5 dijets ) involve both of these gluon distributions through convolution in transverse momentum space .    in terms of the operator definitions of the weizscker - williams gluon distribution @xmath2 and the dipole gluon distribution",
    "@xmath3,the evolution of @xmath3 appears to be given by the evolution of the dipole scattering amplitude which obeys the balitsky - kovchegov equation @xcite , while @xmath2 is governed by the evolution of both dipole and quadrupole scattering amplitudes . for more complicated dijet processes in pa collisions",
    "@xcite , one needs to use both the dipole and the quadrupole evolution equations since the cross sections of those processes involve both gluon distributions and their combinations . knowing both dipole and quadrupole forward scattering amplitudes on a target allows one to understand their small-@xmath0 behavior and",
    "thus compute physical observables in high energy scatterings in large @xmath1 limit .",
    "this is necessary to describe dijet processes in both dis and pa collisions systematically .",
    "the objective of this paper is to derive the small-@xmath0 evolution equation of the quadrupole and the weizscker - williams gluon distribution without taking the large @xmath1 limit , and study their small-@xmath0 behavior .",
    "as far as the quadrupole amplitude @xmath6 is concerned , it seems that qualitatively it is understood quite well . in the leading twist limit when the density is low",
    ", it obeys a bfkl type equation .",
    "when all the sizes of the quadrupole are comparable to the scale at which unitarity sets in , namely @xmath7(@xmath8 is the so - called saturation momentum , which depends on the rapidity @xmath9 , and whose inverse gives the order of magnitude of the size above which color - neutral objects are absorbed . ) , the quadrupole amplitude evolves towards the stable fixed point @xmath10 and the corresponding weizscker - williams gluon distribution @xmath2 starts to saturate .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "finally , we note that there is a traveling wave picture @xcite for the evolution of @xmath6 , or of @xmath97 , exactly analogous to that for @xmath41 , or @xmath98 .",
    "the velocities of the traveling waves for @xmath99 and @xmath67 are identical , since the velocity is determined by bfkl evolution .",
    "if one scales all coordinates in @xmath99 uniformly then the shapes of the traveling wave front of @xmath99 and @xmath67 are identical except near the top of the fronts , that is where nonlinear terms in the evolution become important .",
    "in summary , using the jimwlk hamiltonian , we have derived the evolution equation for the quadrupole and the weizscker - williams gluon distribution at finite @xmath1 .",
    "we find that they follow bfkl evolution in the dilute regime and reach the saturation regime as a stable fixed point .",
    "following the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite , we know that bfkl evolution together with a saturation boundary are responsible for the geometrical scaling behavior @xcite of the dipole gluon distribution . since we also observe the same properties for the quadrupole evolution equation , we believe that the weizscker - williams gluon distribution should exhibit geometrical scaling behavior as well , although its evolution equation is much more complicated .",
    "it seems that quadrupoles evolve essentially the way dipoles do , but their evolution is more difficult to evaluate due to the complicated structure of the evolution equation .",
    "the difference of their small-@xmath0 evolution behavior lies in the transition region between the scaling regime and the saturation regime .",
    "likely , numerical studies of quadrupole evolution will be necessary to understand the details of their different behavior .",
