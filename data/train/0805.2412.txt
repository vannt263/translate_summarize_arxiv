    "the compact binary coalescence ( cbc ) working group of the ligo - virgo joint collaboration is a data - analysis group looking for gravitational - wave signals emitted by inspiralling compact binary systems  @xcite .",
    "the time that such a signal will spend in the frequency bandwidth of the current ground - based gravitational - wave interferometers lies in a range which goes from a few tenths up to several tens of seconds .",
    "the burst working group of the ligo - virgo joint collaboration is a data - analysis group looking for transient gravitational - wave signals without specific assumptions on the expected waveform  @xcite .",
    "the typical duration of the signals searched by the burst group is of the order of the millisecond to a tenth of second .",
    "both of these working groups use analysis methods that are sensitive to the non - stationary and non - gaussian noise of the detectors .",
    "noise transients can induce false alarm triggers in the analysis pipelines that may result in accidental coincidences between the interferometers .",
    "it is therefore crucial to submit each gravitational - wave candidate identified by the analysis to a detection checklist which aims to estimate confidence in this candidate .",
    "the detection checklist is made of a list of standard tests in different stages of development that are used to review the gravitational - wave candidates .",
    "an overview of this checklist is provided in section  [ checklistoverview ] .",
    "section  [ significance ] shows a method implemented by the burst and cbc groups to estimate the statistical significance of the candidates . in section  [ checklistitems ] , the paper will describe with more details a few items of the detection checklist , using an example of simulated gravitational - wave signal and false - alarm trigger for illustration purposes .",
    "a detection checklist to evaluate the significance of candidate - events has been developed by both the cbc and burst groups . despite some specificities inherent to the kind of signals that are being looked for by the cbc and burst searches , the method implemented to estimate confidence in a gravitational - wave candidate",
    "is very similar for both data - analysis groups .",
    "thus the summary of the checklist provided in this section applies both to the cbc and burst groups , unless otherwise noted .",
    "the list presented below is a short synthesis of the tests implemented in the cbc and burst detection checklists .",
    "as many of these tests are still under development or refinement , the checklist is rapidly evolving , and the following list should not be considered exhaustive .",
    "moreover , it is expected that many of the tests that are at present qualitative and based on the experience gained about the instruments will be developed into quantitative tests . here",
    "we outline the main tests that are currently part of the detection checklist for candidate - events or in the process of implementation :    * * statistical significance * the first step of the candidate validation procedure consists of determining the statistical significance of the candidates identified by the analysis pipeline , that is to say the probability of coincident triggers arising from random coincidences of noise triggers .",
    "the general method is described in section  [ significance ] , which will also explain how the statistical significance of the candidates affects the way the other tests of the checklist are addressed . * * data integrity : * sanity checks to verify that the data set containing the candidate is not corrupted . * * status of the interferometers : * the state of the ligo interferometers  @xcite and their sensitivity near the time of the candidate are checked .",
    "this test also includes a verification of the data quality flags recorded in the database .",
    "section  [ ifostatus ] will show how this test can allow the identification of noisy data segment containing false - alarm triggers . * * environmental or instrumental causes : * we analyze auxiliary channels of the interferometers , such as the environmental sensors or the signals involved in the mirror control loops  @xcite , to check for the presence of possible noise transients which could be the cause of a false alarm identified by the analysis .",
    "this effort is also part of the `` glitch group '' activities  @xcite .",
    "more details on this part of the detection checklist are provided in section  [ instrumentalcause ] . * * candidate s appearance : * part of the detection checklist consists of tests of the candidate s appearance .",
    "these tests aim to confirm the presence of a gravitational - wave signal in the data or to identify obvious excesses of noise responsible for a false alarm .",
    "a variety of tools are used to examine the data containing the candidate - event , such as time series , time - frequency spectrograms , or the outputs of the search pipeline , namely the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) or the @xmath0  @xcite time series in the case of the cbc search  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of this graphical information is performed by comparing the results obtained at the time of the candidate - event to the expectations for simulated gravitational - wave signals or for known instances of false - alarm triggers .",
    "two examples of candidate appearance tests will be presented in section  [ appearance ] .",
    "a complementary and quantitative test to establish a likelihood ranking of the candidates given their estimated parameters is in preparation . * * detection robustness : * the burst group has developed many independent search algorithms looking for unmodelled gravitational - wave signals , a few instances of which are block - normal  @xcite , kleinewelle  @xcite , qonline  @xcite and waveburst  @xcite .",
    "the robustness of a detection for burst searches is checked by verifying that the candidate - event is identified by different independent algorithms . in the case of the cbc search",
    ", the list of candidate - events is obtained from a single analysis pipeline based on match filter algorithm  @xcite using specific inspiral waveforms  @xcite .",
    "however a bayesian analysis dedicated to the search for inspiral signals  @xcite has also been developed and the cbc group has started using it as an independent algorithm to check the robustness of the detection .",
    "part of the detection robustness test also consists in verifying the accuracy of the detectors calibration  @xcite at the time of the detection .",
    "a current effort of the cbc group is to automate a test that will check the impact of possible calibration errors on the analysis . to this purpose",
    "the data will be reanalyzed using a calibration modified to represent the possible uncertainties on the measurement .",
    "* * correlation between interferometers : * other tests of the detection checklist consist in checking for the correlation between the signals measured in the different detectors of the network composed of the three ligo interferometers  @xcite , geo600  @xcite and virgo  @xcite .",
    "the burst group has developed many network or coherent analyses  @xcite , one example of which is coherent waveburst , based on a constraint likelihood method  @xcite .",
    "the cbc group is developing two tests that check for the expected signal correlations in the data containing coincident triggers from multiple detectors .",
    "one of these tests uses the matched filtering algorithm  @xcite to compute the multi - interferometer coherent snr  @xcite and compares it with the null - stream statistic  @xcite for inspiral waveforms to assess the significance of a trigger being an inspiral event . the essential idea behind this test",
    "is that above a certain threshold value for the coherent snr , real gravitational - wave signals will yield a smaller value for the null - stream statistic than instrumental or environmental glitches of the same coherent snr .",
    "the second test uses a bayesian approach to infer the posterior distributions of the signal parameters  @xcite .",
    "both are currently tested as part of the detection checklist .",
    "in addition to these checks for correlation between interferometers , the analysis groups also verify whether the candidate - event is identified by the resonant bar detectors  @xcite .",
    "* * coincidence with other types of astrophysical observatories : * the ligo scientific collaboration is implementing procedures to check for possible coincidences between gravitational - wave candidates and gamma - ray bursts , optical transients or neutrinos observations  @xcite .",
    "cumulative histogram of the combined snr , @xmath1 , for the s4 binary neutron star search : for the in - time coincident candidate - events ( triangles ) , and for the estimated background of accidental coincidences ( crosses and 1 standard - deviation ranges ) .",
    "this figure has been extracted from @xcite .",
    "all candidates were found consistent with the background.,width=283 ]    in order to estimate the statistical significance of the candidate - events , the cbc and burst searches compare the triggers found in coincidence between at least two of the ligo interferometers to an expected background of accidental coincidences .",
    "this background is estimated by repeating the analysis after time - shifting the data of each interferometer with respect to each other .",
    "this method , called the time - slides analysis , has already been described in previous publications such as  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ s4bnshistogram ] shows an example of comparison between the in - time coincident candidate - events and the expected background for the binary neutron star search run over the data taken during the ligo fourth ( s4 ) science run  @xcite . in this example , the background was estimated with one hundred time - slide experiments .",
    "the goal of a candidate s follow - up with the checklist depends on whether or not the candidate has a low probability of being an accidental coincidence .",
    "if the loudest candidate is consistent with the estimated background ( as the candidates shown in figure  [ s4bnshistogram ] ) , then the few loudest candidates are investigated to make sure that the accidental coincidences are not due to an undiagnosed instrumental artefact .",
    "when such an instrumental artefact is diagnosed properly , this can lower the background and reveal gravitational waves . in case",
    "a candidate has a low probability of accidental coincidence ( i.e. if the candidate is lying above the estimated background ) , the goal of the follow - up is then to strengthen our confidence in a possible detection by submitting the candidate to the detection checklist that gravitational - wave signals should pass successfully .",
    "this section will highlight a few examples of tests used for the review of candidate - events . in order to illustrate the expected results for an inspiral gravitational - wave signal we will refer to a simulated inspiral signal .",
    "this simulation was performed by acting on one of the arm test masses of the interferometers to generate a differential motion of the interferometer arm cavities approximately equivalent to the expected effect of a gravitational wave .",
    "this simulated gravitational - wave signal was detected by the cbc analysis and stands as an outlier above the estimated background .",
    "we will also illustrate the behaviour of the detection checklist when it is applied to an example of false alarm . in the following subsections",
    ", we will refer to the simulated gravitational wave as _ candidate g _ and to the false alarm as _",
    "candidate f_.",
    "inspiral range as a function of time at livingston ( the origin of time is arbitrary ) .",

    "two science segments are represented in this figure ( corresponding to the time windows 16.5 - 102.2 min and 122.7 - 162.9 min ) .",
    "the _ candidate f _ was found in the first science segment , at t@xmath298.2  min .",
    "this time is underlined by a solid vertical line.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    a fraction of the detection checklist consists in verifying the status of the interferometers and the data quality in the segment containing the candidate .",
    "this includes examining the figures of merit ( detectors state , sensitivity , seismic trends ) posted in the detectors log , scanning the database which contains the list of data quality flags , as well as checking the information reported by the `` glitch group ''  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this study is to check for a possible misbehaviour of the detectors or an unusual excess of noise which could translate into a higher rate of false - alarm triggers and thus reduce our confidence in the candidate - event .",
    "for instance we check how the detectors sensitivity varies in time and how it might affect the performances of our searches .",
    "figure  [ badsensemon ] shows a plot displaying the minute trends of the inspiral search range at the livingston s site , called _ inspiral range _",
    "@xcite , for a time window of about 3 hours which includes the _ candidate f_. the _ inspiral range _ is conventionally defined as the distance at which the coalescence of a 1.4 - 1.4 @xmath3 binary neutron stars system would be detected by the search with a snr of 8 averaged over all sky positions and orientations . during the day from which the three hours of data shown in figure  [ badsensemon ] have been extracted",
    ", the typical _ inspiral range _ measured in science mode was fluctuating between 8.5 and 10.5  mpc .",
    "however one can notice that the first science segment shown in figure  [ badsensemon ] ( between t=16.5  min and t=102.2  min ) ends with a sharp drop in the _ inspiral range _ for about twenty five minutes . the inspiral trigger associated with _",
    "candidate f _ ( false alarm ) in the livingston data was found within this segment ( it is highlighted by the solid vertical line in figure  [ badsensemon ] ) while the _ inspiral range _ was about 2.5  mpc , that is to say well below the averaged sensitivity reached by the interferometer during this day . at these times , the background is usually significantly larger than the average during the run used to calculate the statistical significance of the candidate . ranking the science segments by the standard deviation of the inspiral range , this segment was found to be in the top 0.5% , indicating a very noisy time .",
    "since the _ candidate f _ was first examined , a data quality flag has been created to mark such noisy segments ( this is an advisory flag used to exert caution in case of a detection candidate ) .",
    "the presence of an unusual excess of noise in the livingston interferometer was also reported in the detector log by the control room experts which were monitoring the detector s behaviour at that time .",
    "the remarkable noisiness of the detector prejudices us against _ candidate f _ , although this check does not prove that the candidate itself is due to detector noise .",

    "@xcite , equivalent to a snr squared for the q - transform . under the assumption of gaussian noise",
    ", the z significance could be associated to a false alarm rate proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "however , due to the non - gaussian , non - stationary nature of the noise present in the auxiliary channels , we can not rely on the previous assumption .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain a statistical ranking of an instrumental transient , we need to determine empirically the background of the auxiliary channel containing this transient .    for each auxiliary channel",
    "the background is estimated by running qscan at times which are randomly distributed over data - taking epochs and by recording the z significance measured at each of these random times .",
    "this provides a distribution of _ z significances _ corresponding to the background of the auxiliary channel .",
    "since the background of an auxiliary channel might change during a long data - taking due for example to seasonal variations of the environmental noises or to instrumental drifts , we perform several estimations of the background , over large ( such as a year ) and short ( such as a few days ) epochs , and compare the results .",

    "another estimation of the seismometer background was obtained by analyzing only two days of data including the time of the _ candidate g _ and led to a similar conclusion .",
    "the fact that a statistically loud seismic transient is found at the time of the _ candidate g _ is however not sufficient to rule it out as a possible detection .",

    "<S> the ligo scientific collaboration ( lsc ) is developing and running analysis pipelines to search for gravitational - wave transients emitted by astrophysical events such as compact binary mergers or core - collapse supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> however , because of the non - gaussian , non - stationary nature of the noise exhibited by the ligo detectors , residual false alarms might be found at the end of the pipelines . </S>",
    "<S> a critical aspect of the search is then to assess our confidence for gravitational waves and to distinguish them from those false alarms . </S>",
    "<S> both the `` compact binary coalescence '' and the `` burst '' working groups have been developing a detection checklist for the validation of candidate - events , consisting of a series of tests which aim to corroborate a detection or to eliminate a false alarm . </S>",
    "<S> these tests include for example data quality checks , analysis of the candidate appearance , parameter consistency studies , and coherent analysis . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> the general methodology used for candidate validation is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the method is illustrated with an example of simulated gravitational - wave signal and a false alarm . </S>"
