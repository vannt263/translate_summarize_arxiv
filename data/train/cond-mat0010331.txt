    "the last years have seen a revival of interest in simple dipolar fluids , which consist of spherical particles with embedded point dipoles , triggered by two unexpected observations : at high interaction strengths and high densities a liquid phase with long - range ferroelectric orientational order but without any positional order occurs @xcite ; at low densities the particles form a gas of chains behaving like living polymers @xcite .",
    "the latter effect was suggested as an explanation for the apparent absence of gas - liquid condensation in dipolar hard spheres @xcite , but this subject is still under discussion @xcite .",
    "both phenomena have first been detected in computer simulations @xcite , followed by theoretical work @xcite .",
    "this discussion applies to electric and magnetic dipoles in complete analogy ; in the following we will use the electric language .",
    "knowledge about the solid phase of these systems is necessary in order to know under which circumstances formation of the ferroelectric liquid is preempted by freezing .",
    "this question has been tackled theoretically within two different versions of density - functional theory .",
    "groh and dietrich @xcite found a stable ferroelectric liquid for the stockmayer ( i.e. , dipolar lennard - jones ) model if the dipole moment is high enough .",
    "klapp and coworkers , however , found within their approach that the ferroelectric liquid is always metastable in comparison with the solid both for stockmayer and dipolar hard sphere fluids @xcite .",
    "but in a recent study they demonstrated that their result depends sensitively on the applied approximations @xcite .",
    "the only solid structures considered in these papers @xcite are face - centered cubic ( fcc ) , which is the known crystal structure in the non - polar limit , and body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) with the special axis ratio @xmath3 , which had been determined before as the ground state of dipolar hard spheres @xcite and has also been observed in simulations @xcite and in experiments @xcite with electrorheological fluids , i.e. , suspensions of polarizable colloidal particles .    in a recent simulation gao and",
    "zeng @xcite confirmed the occurrence of a stable ferroelectric liquid phase for the stockmayer model and , in addition , determined for the first time portions of the phase boundaries between isotropic and ferroelectric liquid and between ferroelectric liquid and solid .",
    "although these results support the basic conclusion in [ solid ] they found that the stable solid phase of the stockmayer model is body - centered orthorhombic ( bco ) and additionally observed a metastable distorted hexagonal structure , possibilities that have not been taken into account in the theoretical work @xcite so far .",
    "both bco and bct as well as an fcc crytal with helically varying polarization direction have been reported before in simulations of dipolar hard spheres @xcite , but the thermodynamically stable state could not be determined .",
    "certain structures may be suppressed in simulations due to the periodic boundary conditions if the cell shape is not flexible enough .    a simple heurestic argument why a cubic structure is not expected runs as follows .",
    "all these crystals are ferroelectric and hence have less symmetry than in the nonpolar case ; the point symmetries can only be reflections at planes that contain the polarization axis and rotations around this axis .",
    "therefore if , e.g. , in a cubic crystal a polarization in @xmath4 $ ] direction is switched on , the additional introduction of a contraction along this direction does not further reduce the remaining symmetry .",
    "hence generically the crystal will have an axis ratio different from unity , i.e. , it will be tetragonal . for polarization along the initial @xmath5 $ ] and",
    "@xmath6 $ ] directions the same reasoning leads to orthorhombic and trigonal crystals .",
    "thus a ferroelectric solid can never be strictly cubic , in contrast to the assumptions made in the density - functional work described above and in similar work on the heisenberg fluid @xcite .",
    "thus up to now it is quite unclear which crystal structure(s ) actually are stable in these widely used dipolar model systems . as a first step to elucidate this region of their phase diagram in the present work",
    "we determine the ground state structure as a function of density , dipole strength , and softness of the isotropic interaction potential .",
    "since in principle an infinite number of crystal structures exists , characterized by an increasing number of parameters with increasing number of particles in the basis , an exhaustive search for the ground state is not possible .",
    "however , we include a rather large class of candidate structures , comprising among others all reasonable simple bravais lattices .",
    "a relatively complex phase behavior is found at @xmath0 .",
    "there is reason to expect that the ground state results remain qualitatively valid at not too high temperatures and thus provide a valuable starting point for a more complete analysis of the full phase diagram .    in a recent work @xcite ground state energies and ordering temperatures for ferroelectric and antiferroelectric arrangements of ising dipoles on several lattices",
    "have been determined , but no attempt has been made to optimize the lattice structure . in this study also the presence of isotropic interactions was not taken into account .    in our analysis",
    "we always assume a spatially homogeneous polarization throughout the sample",
    ". in real ferroelectric materials domains will form due to the long range nature of the dipolar interaction @xcite .",
    "the domain structure in the _ liquid _ ferroelectric phase for a cubic sample shape has been analyzed in detail in [ simann ] .",
    "this more complicated situation is avoided in two cases : ( i ) a needle - shaped sample ( infinite aspect ratio ) , implying a vanishing depolarization factor ; ( ii ) cancelling of the induced surface charges by free charges which are present in a conducting surrounding medium or as impurities in the material itself .    after having",
    "reached a basically complete overview of the thermodynamically stable _ ground _ states in such systems , which is interesting in its own right , in a second step by using density - functional theory we return to the issue which solid phase the ferroelectric liquid phase the stockmayer fluid forms upon _ freezing_. this closes the aforementioned gap between the analysis of the solid phases as considered so far in the theoretical analyses @xcite and the observation of those types of solid structures as found in simulations @xcite .",
    "it consolidates the theoretical prediction @xcite that the stockmayer fluid can exhibit a thermodynamically stable ferroelectric liquid phase , in accordance with the simulation results .",
    "we study systems of spherical dipolar particles interacting via the dipolar potential @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the interparticle vector and @xmath9 the dipole moment , which is assumed to have the same orientation for all particles .",
    "in addition there is an isotropic interaction @xmath10 which is taken as either the purely repulsive soft sphere ( ss ) potential @xmath11 or the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential @xmath12.\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 define the energy and length scales , respectively .",
    "the ground state properties only depend on the reduced dipole moment @xmath15 and the reduced particle density @xmath16 of @xmath17 particles in the volume @xmath18 .",
    "since in the ss case only the combination @xmath19 enters the potential , the only independent thermodynamic parameter is @xmath20 . in the lj case",
    "the ground state energy per particle @xmath21 has the form @xmath22 whereas for the ss case one has @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are dimensionless scaling functions which contain all the structure dependence . for soft spheres",
    "the optimum structure remains the same as long as @xmath26 is kept constant because the prefactor @xmath27 is the same for all structures belonging to a given reduced density @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore one can show that also phase coexistence densities @xmath29 determined for one value of @xmath30 can be scaled to another dipole moment @xmath31 according to @xmath32 , because @xmath33 with another scaling function @xmath34 .",

    "we implicitly have replaced a double sum over the lattice sites by a single sum , assuming that the average energy per particle is equal to the energy of the particle at the origin .",
    "it is a non - trivial issue whether this assumption is justified for the long - ranged dipolar potential . in the appendix",
    "we show that it is correct for a homogeneous orientational configuration in an ellipsoidal sample shape , but not , e.g. , for a parallelepiped .",

    "the sum of @xmath47 is then evaluated in reciprocal space using the poisson sum formula . for the inverse",

    "these possibilities have been chosen for the following reasons .",
    "the structures bco , hexc , and hexab are generated by slight distortions of the close packed fcc and hcp lattices which represent the ground state for @xmath86 .",
    "the structures fco and trig are included , because they approach reasonable low density configurations in certain limits , which have been observed in electrorheological fluids @xcite . for @xmath87 trig",
    "degenerates into a hexagonal array of dipolar chains , and for @xmath88 fco develops into a collection of parallel sheets .",
    "the only remaining bravais lattices , monoclinic and triclinic , are improbable and also difficult to handle because of the larger number of free parameters .",
    "we tested a monoclinic variation of bco and always found that the energy is minimized for a right angle between the axes .",
    "concerning more complex lattices it is difficult to define a reasonable parameter space without a physically motivated structure to start from .",
    "if one starts from the fcc structure of the nonpolar lj system and introduces a dipole moment , all orientations of the polarization have the same energy , as long as the cubic symmetry is preserved .",
    "however , as discussed in the introduction , the crystal actually distorts towards bco , bct , or trig , depending on the direction of the polarization .",
    "the numerical findings indicate that the @xmath5 $ ] direction is selected , corresponding to a bco distortion as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattices ] . intuitively this can be understood as a preference for the formation of chains along the polarization direction : @xmath5 $ ] points towards the nearest neighbors so that the particle distance along the chains is smallest in this case . indeed , upon increasing the dipole moment the length of the @xmath69 axis decreases , reflecting the strong attractive interactions along the chains .",
    "figure  [ fig : minrf ] displays the dependence of the bco axis ratios on the reduced dipole moment @xmath30 . the result of gao and zeng @xcite for @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 denoted by the diamonds lies very close to the @xmath0 result .",
    "obviously the ground state gives a good approximation to the equilibrium state at least up to half the triple temperature @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the same authors also report a metastable hexab structure at @xmath90 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 with the axis ratios @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the corresponding values in the ideal hcp lattice are @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively . at @xmath0",
    "the hexab crystal is only metastable , too , with @xmath99 and @xmath100 . with increasing dipole moment the two bco axis lengths",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath70 perpendicular to @xmath101 approach each other until at a critical value @xmath102 a continuous transition to bct takes place ( fig .",
    "[ fig : minrf ] ) . after",
    "a cusp at @xmath102 in the bct phase @xmath103 decreases again and is much lower than the `` ideal '' value @xmath104 found for dipolar hard spheres .",
    "the true ground state of the nonpolar lj model , however , is hcp which has an energy very slightly below the fcc value ( by 0.010.02% depending on density ) .",
    "this difference is only due to second nearest neighbors because the number and distances of the 12 nearest neighbors are equal in fcc and hcp .",
    "the dipolar energy of the hcp lattice with polarization along the @xmath69 axis @xcite is lower than with polarization along the @xmath70 axis @xcite .",
    "therefore for small dipole moments a slightly contracted hcp lattice ( hexc ) is preferred over bco , although the energy differences are always very small , e.g. , below 0.16% for @xmath89 . at larger dipole moments",
    "bco takes over as the stable phase .",
    "because of the smallness of these differences entropy effects at finite temperature may easily tip the balance towards one or the other phase .",
    "the full @xmath0 phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasstock ] .",
    "the hexc - bco transition is first order but exhibits only a tiny density jump @xmath105 .",
    "the dashed line @xmath106 marks the absolute minimum of the energy per particle over all densities . if a system is prepared with a density below @xmath107 it spontaneously shrinks to this minimum and leaves a corresponding portion of empty space .",
    "thus the region @xmath108 is a two - phase coexistence region between the lowest energy solid and an infinitely diluted gas .",
    "for @xmath109 it connects to gas - solid coexistence while the liquid phase(s ) appear only at higher temperature above a triple point .",
    "that @xmath107 corresponds to a phase coexistence density can also be shown more formally by performing a double tangent construction on the ( free ) energy density @xmath110 . for finite temperatures",
    "an entropic term @xmath111 must be added for the gas phase , so that a double tangent at @xmath112 and @xmath113 can be constructed with @xmath114 the last equation is equivalent to the minimum condition @xmath115 .",
    "thus we conclude that at @xmath0 the stockmayer crystal in the commonly studied range @xmath116 is either hexc or bco , but neither fcc nor bct as assumed in various studies before .      in this section",
    "we present the predictions of the density - functional theory ( dft ) , which we applied to freezing of the stockmayer fluid in our previous work @xcite , when the additional crystal structures hexc and bco are taken into account .",
    "this approach is based on a perturbation expansion around the hard sphere solid which is treated in the modified weighted - density approximation of denton and ashcroft @xcite .",
    "the long - ranged isotropic and dipolar interactions are added in such a way that a successful theory of the lennard - jones fluid @xcite is reproduced in the nonpolar limit .",
    "the detailed definition of the density functional is given in [ solid ] and therefore is not repeated here .    in order to treat the hexc phase with more than one basis particle some of the expressions given in [ solid ] must be generalized",
    "; e.g. , the expression for the long - range contribution to the excess free energy turns into @xmath117 with @xmath118 and the other quantities as defined in [ solid ] . besides the peak width @xmath78 and the orientational order parameters , the axis ratios now appear as additional variables in the minimization .",
    "figure  [ fig : mindft ] shows the variation of the bco axis ratios as function of the dipole moment at fixed temperature and density . for low @xmath30 the particles in the crystal are orientationally disordered and both axis ratios are equal to @xmath119 corresponding to an fcc lattice .",
    "when ferroelectric order sets in both axis ratios eventually decrease but exhibit a peculiar minimum and maximum in an intermediate range of values for @xmath30 .",
    "the contraction along the polarization direction ( @xmath69 axis ) is in accordance with the ground state result . on the other hand , in contrast to the dft results , both at @xmath0 and in the simulations the value of @xmath120 is larger than @xmath119 and increases with @xmath30 ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : minrf ] ) .",
    "a quantitative comparison with the simulation results for @xmath90 is not possible because such high dipole moments could not be reached in the theory .",

    "ferroelectric solid and gas  ferroelectric solid transition densities . for comparison",
    "our previous data assuming an fcc structure are displayed , too .",
    "the shift due to the new crystal structure is relatively small and has no impact on the occurrence of the ferroelectric liquid phase as such .",
    "the axis ratio @xmath103 always lies below the ideal hcp value @xmath122 ; it varies between 1.58 and 1.62 along the parts of the coexistence lines shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phas2 ] .",
    "surprisingly it decreases with increasing density while the opposite trend is observed in the ground state .",
    "for the lower dipole moment @xmath35 the free energy differences between hexc , bco , and fcc are smaller than the numerical accuracy so that with the present tools it is not possible to decide which phase is the stable one . in any case , however , the loci of the phase boundaries remain practically the same as calculated in [ solid ] . thus we conclude that our dft prediction of the occurrence of a stable ferroelectric liquid phase within a certain parameter range is not altered by taking into account more possibilities for the crystal structure and thus is in agreement with the findings of the simulations",

    "the dipolar energy per particle is @xmath175 where the superscript @xmath173 refers to a finite system and the lattice vectors @xmath37 and @xmath176 run over the @xmath17 sites inside the sample . in the second form",
    "one summation has been carried out so that @xmath177 runs over a sample of doubled size , and the function @xmath178 counts the number of occurrences of a given interparticle vector @xmath177 .",
    "if for large systems the discrete array of sites is approximated by a uniform distribution of the same density , the function @xmath178 is given by the ratio of the intersection volume of two ellipsoids shifted by @xmath177 relative to each other and the volume of one ellipsoid .",
    "the explicit result derived in [ paper ] is @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the angle between @xmath177 and the @xmath64 axis .",
    "for rapidly decaying potentials in the thermodynamic limit @xmath181 @xmath178 can be replaced by 1 because the difference @xmath182 becomes appreciable only for large values of @xmath183 comparable with @xmath173 which , however , have a small weigth in eq .",
    "( [ udipl ] ) due to the vanishing of @xmath184 .",
    "but it is unclear whether this line of argument also holds for the slowly decaying dipolar potential . in order to check this",
    "we choose a cutoff radius @xmath185 beyond which one may approximate the summation in eq .",
    "( [ udipl ] ) by an integral . in this limit the terms with",

    "the same is obviously true for the contributions from @xmath193 for @xmath181 .",
    "these considerations justify that the average energy per particle may be replaced by the energy of the central particle .",
    "we emphasize that this argument hinges on the ellipsoidal shape of the sample .",
    "for example , by explicit calculations one can show that the replacement is _ not _ correct for a parallelepiped with general aspect ratio .",
    "the ewald form of the dipolar lattice sum is often used without any discussion of the shape dependence of the original sum @xcite . in the following",
    "we show that it actually corresponds to a specific choice of the sample shape and we derive the corrections that must be applied for other shapes . to this end",
    "the dipolar sum is constructed by superposition of two slightly shifted opposite point charge lattices .",
    "hence we first recapitulate the derivation of the corresponding ewald sum for the electrostatic potential @xmath194 of a finite bravais lattice of positive unit point charges plus an opposite uniform background charge .",
    "the ewald method proceeds by rearranging the charge density @xmath195 into two contributions , employing a suitable addition of zero : first @xmath196 corresponding to a lattice of positive gaussian charge distributions plus the negative background , second @xmath197 corresponding to a lattice of negative gaussians plus the positive point charges : @xmath198 \\\\ \\intertext{where }    \\rho_1^{(0)}({{\\bf r } } ) & = \\left(\\frac{\\nu^2}{\\pi}\\right)^{3/2 } e^{-\\nu^2    r^2}-\\frac{1}{v_c } \\theta_c({{\\bf r } } ) \\\\ \\intertext{and }   \\rho_2^{(0)}({{\\bf r } } ) & = \\delta({{\\bf r}})-\\left(\\frac{\\nu^2}{\\pi}\\right)^{3/2 } e^{-\\nu^2    r^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath199 if @xmath8 is in the unit cell around the origin and @xmath200 otherwise .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath201 of the first contribution is @xmath202 the @xmath173 dependence arises via the summation over the finite number of lattice vectors , indicated by the prime on the summation sign .",
    "the sum in eq .",
    "( [ rho1k ] ) is strongly peaked around the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath203 for large systems and approaches @xmath204 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the corresponding electrostatic potential is @xmath205 if the unit cell is chosen as the volume spanned by the basis vectors and as centered around @xmath206 one finds @xmath207 for all @xmath208 and @xmath209 due to local charge neutrality . for the second contribution",
    "@xmath197 the potential is easily obtained by integration of the poisson equation in spherical coordinates yielding @xmath210 for @xmath181 the total potential is @xcite @xmath211 where @xmath212 is a constant stemming from the small @xmath213 contributions in eq .",

    "both sums are rapidly converging and @xmath194 is independent of @xmath56 .",

    "furthermore the hats indicate that the coulomb potential @xmath216 must also be subtracted , because the field of the dipole at the origin must not be included .",

    "the generalization to lattices with basis follows from summing the contributions from each sublattice .",
    "the second term is calculated using @xmath219 by performing the inner integration and expanding in terms of @xmath138 one finds @xmath220 the expression in brackets is the depolarization factor @xmath221 of an ellipsoid with aspect ratio @xmath213 @xcite .",
    "all other terms are independent of @xmath213 for @xmath181 . thus we have derived an explicit result for the shape dependence of the dipolar energy which is the same as for the homogeneous dipole density studied in [ paper ] . since @xmath222 eq .",
