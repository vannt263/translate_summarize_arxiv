    "a significant tool for sat research has been the study of random instances .",
    "it has stimulated fruitful interactions among the areas of artificial intelligence , theoretical computer science , mathematics and statistical physics .",
    "recently there has been a growth of interest in a powerful generalization of the boolean satisfiability , namely the satisfiability of quantified boolean formulas , qbfs .",
    "compared to the well - known propositional formulas , qbfs permit both universal and existential quantifiers over boolean variables .",
    "thus qbfs allow the modelling of problems having higher complexity than sat , ranging in the polynomial hierarchy up to pspace .",
    "these problems include problems from the areas of verification , knowledge representation and logic ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "models for generating random instances of qbf have been proposed @xcite .",
    "problems for which one can combine practical experiments with theoretical studies are natural candidates for first investigations @xcite . in this paper , we focus on a certain subclass of closed quantified boolean formulas , which can be seen as quantified extended @xmath12-formulas .",
    "these formulas bear similarities with @xmath12-formulas , whose random instances have been extensively studied in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . at the same time , the introduction of quantifiers increases the complexity and requires additional parameters for the generation of random instances .",
    "more precisely , we are interested in closed formulas in conjunctive normal form ( cnf ) having two quantifier blocks , namely in formulas of the type @xmath13 , where @xmath3 and @xmath5 denote distinct sets of variables , and @xmath14 is a conjunction of 3-clauses , each of which containing exactly one universal literal and two existential ones . evaluating the truth value of such formulas",
    "is known to be @xmath15-complete @xcite .",
    "in order to generate random instances we have to introduce several parameters . the first one is the pair @xmath16 that specifies the number of variables in each quantifier block , i.e. , in @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "the second one is @xmath17 , the number of clauses",
    ". we shall study the probability that a formula drawn at random uniformly out of this set of formulas evaluates to true as @xmath6 tends to infinity .",
    "we will denote by @xmath18 this probability .",
    "thus , we are interested in @xmath19    let us recall that the transition from satisfiability to unsatisfiability for random @xmath12 formulas is sharp .",
    "indeed , there is a _ critical value _ ( or a _ threshold _ ) of the ratio of the number of clauses to the number of variables , above which the likelihood of a random @xmath12-formula being satisfiable vanishes as @xmath6 tends to infinity , and below which it goes to 1 .",
    "moreover , this critical value is known to be @xmath20 ( see @xcite ) .    on the one hand",
    "observe that , when @xmath21 , a @xmath22-formula with @xmath23 , clauses can be seen as the conjunction of two independent @xmath12-formulas ( each of which corresponds to an assignment to the universal variable and has on average @xmath24 clauses ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath4 is large enough , a random @xmath22-formula with @xmath25 clauses has essentially strictly distinct universal literals , and then behaves as an existential @xmath12-formula .",
    "thus , we can easily prove that the transition between satisfiability and unsatisfiability for random @xmath22-formulas occurs when @xmath26 is between 1 and 2 .",
    "our main contribution is to identify the scale for @xmath4 ( as a function of @xmath6 ) at which an intermediate and original regime can be observed , @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , at this specific scale in developing further the techniques used by chvtal and reed @xcite , and goerdt @xcite , we get the precise location of the threshold as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "our main result is :    [ thm : main ] for any @xmath28 , there exists @xmath29 such that :    * if @xmath30 , then @xmath31 { }      1 $ ] , + * if @xmath32 , then @xmath31 { }      0 $ ] . +    moreover , the critical ratio @xmath33 is given by @xmath34    figure [ fig : thresholdevolution ] shows the evolution of the critical ratio @xmath33 as a function of @xmath10 .",

    "we will call such formulas s. these formulas can be considered as quantified extended @xmath12 formulas , because deleting the only universal literal in each clause and removing the then superfluous @xmath48-quantifiers result in an existentially quantified conjunction of binary clauses .    a truth assignment for the existential ( resp .",

    "the exhaustive algorithm which consists in deciding whether for all assignment to the variables @xmath3 , there exists an assignment to the variables @xmath5 such that @xmath7 is true provides a first upper bound for the worst case complexity .",

    "the resulting formula is a @xmath62-qcnf formula , whose unsatisfiability ( i.e. falsity ) can be decided in linear time ( see @xcite for the details ) .",
    "it remains to be shown that the problem is @xmath15-hard .",
    "we show this by a polynomial - time computable reduction from the satisfiability problem for 3-cnf formulas .",
    "consider such a formula @xmath63 over the variables @xmath64 where each @xmath65 is a disjunction of exactly three literals @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "therefore , in the existential @xmath62-cnf formula obtained after simplification it remains the clause @xmath93 and at least one copy of each clause @xmath92 for every @xmath84 ( the one resulting from @xmath91 , for which @xmath86 ) .",

    "since @xmath74 is minimally unsatisfiable , and according to the remark above , this means that this resulting formula contains at least one copy of each @xmath92 .",
    "this copy can only come from a clause @xmath91 for some @xmath96 .",
    "hence , we can deduce that the assignment @xmath97 for @xmath98 sets the literal @xmath90 to true , and thus satisfies the clause @xmath65 .",
    "hence , this assignment satisfies the formula @xmath10 .",
    "let us first introduce a notion of purity over sets of universal literals that will be of use to characterize the truth value of @xmath22-formulas .",
    "a ( multi-)set of literals is _ pure _ if it does not contain both a variable @xmath99 and its negation @xmath100 . by extension",
    ", we call a @xmath22-formula , @xmath101 , _ pure _ if the set of universal literals occurring in @xmath7 is pure .",
    "[ prop : truth_char ] a @xmath22-formula is false if and only if it contains a false pure subformula .",

    "suppose that the @xmath22-formula @xmath101 is false .",
    "then , there is an assignment @xmath102 to the universal variables @xmath3 such that for all assignment to @xmath5 , @xmath7 evaluates to false .",
    "consider the subformula of @xmath103 obtained in keeping only the clauses for which the universal literal is assigned @xmath61 by @xmath102 , and deleting the other ones .",

    "therefore , we can appeal to the work of chvtal and reed @xcite in order to identify substructures that are sufficient ( respectively , necessary ) to ensure falsity . on",

    "when @xmath4 is large enough , actually when @xmath329 , there is a sharp threshold at @xmath330 : the analysis is similar , and in fact easier , to what we have done for pure snakes in section [ sec : main ] , in considering snakes with strictly distinct universal variables , as shown in @xcite .",
    "this fact should be compared to the fact that the threshold location @xmath331 for @xmath332 goes to 1 when @xmath10 goes to infinity .",
    "more importantly , an original regime is observed when @xmath333 . using counting arguments on pure bicycles , which are the seed of unsatisfiability , and on pure snakes , which are special minimally false formulas",
    ", we got respectively a lower and an upper bound for the threshold .",
    "it turns out that these two bounds coincide , thus giving the exact location of the threshold as a function of @xmath10",
    ". a challenging question would be to determine the scaling window around @xmath331 and get precise information on the typical contradictory cycles that occur in random formulas inside this window .",
    "experiments , which make use of a current qbf solver , have played an important role in our study .",
    "indeed , they have been carried out at a scale large enough in order to give a useful intuition on the behavior of random instances .",
    "however they have also provided evidence that the asymptotical behavior of random quantified instances is difficult to reach . in particular experiments that would aim at measuring the width of the transition from satisfiability to unsatisfiability ( see e.g. , @xcite )",
