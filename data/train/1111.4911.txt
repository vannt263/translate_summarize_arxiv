    "the electronic and optical properties of quantum well structures have been widely investigated in the past decade due to their potential applications in electro - optic and optoelectronic devices . in recent years",
    "there has been growing interest in coupled quantum wells ( cqws ) due to formation of long - lived excitons when these structures are placed in an electric field ( ef ) .",
    "intensive studies of indirect excitons in cqws have resulted in their electrostatic and optical control.@xcite very recently , cqws have been embedded into bragg - mirror microcavities and there has been found a special type of voltage - tuned exciton polaritons which can be used for optical nonlinearities and polariton lasing achieved at much lower threshold powers . @xcite    a cqw structure consists of two quantum wells separated by a barrier layer . for a sufficiently thin barrier ,",
    "the tunneling of carriers through the barrier makes the two wells electronically coupled to each other . as a result ,",
    "an electron ( hole ) can either reside in one of the two wells , or its wave function ( wf ) is distributed between both wells . in the case of coulomb",
    "bound electron and hole residing in the same well , they form a direct exciton . if however they are located in different wells , an indirect exciton is created .    in a symmetric cqw structure with",
    "no ef applied , formerly degenerate single - particle states split , owing to the tunneling through the middle barrier , into doublets with symmetric and antisymmetric states in each .",
    "since only transitions between states having the same parity are optically allowed , the coulomb - coupled electron - hole ( e - h ) pairs form excitonic states which are optically either bright or dark .",
    "an ef , being applied in the growth direction , breaks down the symmetry of the system making all these excitons bright .",
    "in fact , single - particle states experience with ef a transition from states with well defined parity to the ones with the electron ( hole ) located in one of the two wells , thus forming direct and indirect combinations of uncorrelated e - h pair states . these different pair states are coulomb coupled with each other and form an exciton in which direct or indirect pair can dominate . in particular , with increasing ef , the exciton ground state ( gs ) undergoes a transition from bright direct exciton to indirect exciton which has a much weaker optical activity . the exciton radiative lifetime increases due to a reduction in the spatial overlap between the electron and hole wfs .",
    "@xcite the exciton binding energy , in turn , reduces owing to an increased e - h separation .",
    "it has also been found that the electronic coupling between quantum wells considerably enhances the quantum - confined stark effect in cqw structures.@xcite the tunneling effect is also enhanced with the ef allowing the carriers to leak out of the system.@xcite this can lead to a considerable shortening of the photoluminescence decay time.@xcite all these properties of cqws make them a much richer system compared to single quantum wells .",
    "excitonic states in cqws in the presence of ef have been intensively studied in recent years .",
    "different theoretical approaches have been used ranging from variational methods@xcite to direct diagonalizations in which the exciton wf is expanded into a large basis@xcite or the schrdinger equation is discretized in the momentum space.@xcite in this paper , we present a more accurate and straightforward way for solving the schrdinger equation for an exciton in a cqw structure . expanding the exciton wf into e - h pair states we solve in the real space a system of differential equations for the exciton in - plane motion , using the shooting method , here generalized to a matrix form .",
    "the e - h pair basis states are calculated exactly using the analytical form of the electron ( hole ) wf in a uniform ef .",
    "we present the full calculation of exciton bound and ( discretized ) continuum states as well as the absorption spectrum of a cqw in an applied ef .",
    "we study the ef effect on the exciton binding energy and lifetime in 8 - 4 - 8 nm gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as symmetric cqw structure , both for the ground and excited states , and demonstrate a direct - to - indirect crossover of the exciton ground state with increasing ef .",
    "an example of an asymmetric 10 - 4 - 10 nm ingaas cqw having different in content in the left and right qws is also given , demonstrating our calculation of the electron and hole energies of quantization and the exciton transition energies and oscillator strengths as functions of the applied ef .",
    "let us consider a symmetric gaas / al@xmath2ga@xmath3as cqw which consists of two gaas qw layers separated by a thin al@xmath2ga@xmath3as barrier and surrounded on both sides by thick barriers of the same kind .",
    "in this paper we mainly concentrate on a cqw structure which has been intensively used in a series of experiments,@xcite taking the barrier and well widths to be @xmath4 nm and @xmath5 nm , respectively , and the barrier concentration of al to be @xmath6 .",

    "the in - plane reduced mass in the barrier layers ( @xmath41 ) is different from that in the well layers ( @xmath42 ) . however , because of a very small probability for the exciton ground state to find the carriers in the barrier , we take for the in - plane reduced mass the gaas value of @xmath43 .      to solve the excitonic schrdinger equation with the full hamiltonian eq.([ham_full ] ) we first prepare a basis of single - particle states which satisfy the following one - dimensional equations : @xmath44 to do so , we use the advantage of the analytic form of the electron and hole wfs in the rectangular confinement potentials eq.([poten_z ] ) and uniform electric field @xmath7 . in each layer of the cqw structure ,",

    "other qw structures may require higher ess to be taken into account .",
    "these are also needed in our case when a stronger ef is considered . in particular , higher quantized levels for the hole @xmath79 and @xmath80 [ see fig.1(b ) ] are taken into account for @xmath102kv / cm and @xmath103kv / cm , respectively , and these states have a major contribution to the direct exciton wf .",
    "we calculate the exciton transition energy @xmath104 and the in - plane components of the wf , @xmath105 , by solving the matrix differential equation ( [ matrix - se ] ) numerically .",
    "to do so , we introduce a matrix generalization of the shooting method applying the latter to a system of coupled differential equations .",
    "the shooting method transforms a boundary - value problem like schrdinger s equation with bcs to an initial - value problem in which one of the boundary values ( in the present case the wf at @xmath106 ) is taken as a starting point .",
    "the boundary value(s ) on the other side ( at @xmath107 ) is then used to find the eigenenergies .",
    "the bcs follow straightforwardly from eq.([matrix - se ] ) and the asymptotics of the coulomb matrix elements @xmath108 . at large distances @xmath109 , while at small distances the potentials @xmath108 have logarithmic dependence , as is clear from fig.3 . therefore for bound states @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and @xmath113     of the coulomb potential calculated between different e - h pair states at @xmath7=4kv / cm .",

    "in particular , a second - order scheme which we have used in our calculation brings eq.([matrix - se ] ) to the form @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the discretization step and the matrix @xmath117 depends on the coulomb interaction and on a finite - difference representation of the kinetic term eq.([kinetic ] ) .",
    "the wf amplitudes @xmath118 in the starting values @xmath119 in eq.([phi - inf ] ) are the unknowns to be found along with the eigenvalue @xmath104 . going to the very last point @xmath107 and using the boundary condition eq.([bc0 ] ) produces a homogeneous matrix equation of the form @xmath120 in which @xmath121 depends solely on the exciton energy @xmath104 ( and not on @xmath16 any more ) , and thus the energy eigenvalues are determined by @xmath122    for small values of the ef , the electron and hole gs - es splittings are smaller than the exciton coulomb energy ( compare figs.1 and 3 ) and thus several bound states [ having the asymptotics given by eq.([phi - inf ] ) ] can always be found in the system .",
    "however , as the ef grows , the coulomb energy of the exciton ess is getting smaller than the e - h pair splitting energies and thus some of these exciton states become unbound .",
    "since the unbound states have energies @xmath123 , at least for some of their radial components the asymptotics eq.([phi - inf ] ) is no longer valid and a proper treatment of the excitonic continuum is required .",
    "this task is outside the scope of the present paper which mainly concentrates on exciton bound states .",
    "nevertheless , some effects of the continuum and in particular its influence on the excitonic absorption spectrum can be taken into account , in a first attempt , by restricting the exciton in - plane motion to a large circle of radius @xmath124 and in this way discretizing the continuum .",
    "the asymptotic boundary conditions eq.([phi - inf ] ) are now replaced by @xmath125 where the new amplitudes @xmath118 satisfy the same eq.([me ] ) with matrix @xmath126 being redefined accordingly .",
    "it is convenient to normalize the radial components of the wfs introducing expansion coefficients @xmath127 : @xmath128 where @xmath129 is normalized to @xmath130 , and therefore @xmath131 due to orthogonality of the e - h pair states @xmath132 and normalization of the total exciton wf @xmath133 .",
    "finally , for each excitonic state , the oscillator strength per unit area is calculated as@xcite @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the basic dipole matrix element between the valence and conduction bands , and the overlap integral in eq.([osc ] ) accounts for the spatial distribution of the excitonic recombination .",
    "the exciton radiative linewidth is then given by @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the speed of light .",
    "in the presence of ef , the energy levels of the electron and hole single - particle states in a cqw structure experience stark shifts @xmath138 as demonstrated in fig.1 , where @xmath139 is the center - to - center distance between the qws . concentrating on these two lowest levels for the electron and two for the hole we are thus dealing with four e - h pair states . for two of them , @xmath93 and @xmath95 , the energies @xmath140 [ see eq.([e0n ] ) ] remain almost unaffected by the ef as the stark shift for the electron is compensated by that for the hole , while the other two pair states , @xmath91 and @xmath97 , have twice larger stark shifts than the single - particle states : @xmath141 . even though our cqw is symmetric , at nonzero ef the ground and the first excited single - particle states are localized in different wells of the cqw structure ,",
    "see fig.2(b ) . that is why the pair states with electron and hole in the same qw ( @xmath94 and @xmath96 ) are electrically neutral and can be called _",
    "direct _ states while the other two , @xmath92 and @xmath98 , with electron and hole in different qws have nonzero dipole moment and are called _ indirect _ states . as for excitonic states ,",
    "they are , strictly speaking , neither direct nor indirect , since the exciton wf is always a combination of different pair states .      in the absence of the coulomb interaction , all four pair states are nearly degenerate at zero ef : due to a rather weak tunneling through the middle barrier of the cqw , the energy splittings are small compared to the coulomb energy ( 2.3mev and 0.05mev splitting for electron and hole , respectively , versus 49mev binding energy ) .",
    "the coulomb interaction splits further and strongly mixes the direct and indirect e - h pair states . to understand these",
    "splitting and mixing , let us consider the coulomb matrix elements in more detail .     for different exciton states in 8 - 4 - 8 nm gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as symmetric cqw structure , calculated using the exciton confinement radius @xmath142 nm ( a ) and 800 nm ( b ) .",

    "the largest are @xmath148 , due to a considerable overlap between the electron ground and excited states .",

    ", the stark red - shifted indirect state @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) has a remarkable anticrossing with the direct pair state @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) , weakly dependent on the ef .",
    "this anticrossing takes place at about @xmath149kv / cm and is clearly seen in fig.[fig : osc ] .",

    "figure  8 shows the field dependence of the optical transition energies @xmath104 and binding energies @xmath155 of x - gs and x - es , as well as their in - plane exciton bohr radii @xmath156 and the radiative linewidths @xmath157 .",
    "the latter are calculated via eq.([rad ] ) assuming @xmath167nm.@xcite while all these parameters for the x - gs change dramatically when the ef increases from 2kv / cm to 8kv / cm , the x - es remains practically unaffected .",
    "the x - gs energy exhibits a considerable stark shift , for @xmath168kv / cm almost linear in @xmath7 [ fig.[fig : eb](a ) ] , due to the electron - hole separation typical for the indirect exciton .",
    "the x - es in turn has a very weak field dependence due to a much smaller dipole moment of the direct exciton , but in a larger range of the ef values , the x - es transition energy is also red - shifted ( by 12mev at @xmath76kv / cm ) , as a result of an ef - induced electron - hole separation within the same qw .",
    "the x - gs binding energy , @xmath169 , drops from 8mev down to 4mev [ fig.[fig : eb](b ) ] , as a result of the transition from direct to indirect coulomb coupling . for the x - es the binding energy",
    "is defined as the energy distance from x - es to its own continuum onset : @xmath170 .",
    "this is done because the lowest - energy pair state , @xmath91 , has negligible ( for @xmath171kv / cm ) contribution to the x - es , and thus this exciton state remains bound even though its energy @xmath104 is higher than the first continuum onset @xmath172 .",
    "the x - es binding energy is almost unchanged , as the ef has no effect on the direct nature of this state .",
    "the bohr radius [ fig.[fig : eb](c ) ] is fully correlated with the binding energy , increasing with the ef almost by a factor of 2 for the x - gs and showing no change for the x - es .",
    "the d - i crossover is accompanied by a dramatic decrease of the radiative linewidth of the x - gs ( proportional to its oscillator strength ) , see fig.[fig : eb](d ) .",
    "this happens because the ef makes the electron - hole separation larger reducing the overlap of the electron and hole wfs .",
    "the x - es , in turn , being strictly dark at @xmath147 , becomes bright in a finite ef , and its linewidth quickly increases with the ef up to the half of the maximum linewidth of the x - gs . further increase of the ef does not change the x - es radiative rate much but @xmath157 experiences some influence of higher ess , see fluctuations in fig.[fig : eb](d ) .",

    "[ fig : new],title=\"fig : \" ]    to reproduce some previous simulations@xcite and to compare them with our full calculation , we have restricted our basis to the electron and hole gss only , neglecting any ess quantized in the growth direction .",
    "in other words , we have taken into account only one e - h pair state @xmath91 , choosing @xmath177 in the expansion eq.([ex - wf ] ) .",
    "this single - state basis ( ssb ) calculation shows considerably different results compared to the full calculation in all four plots in fig.[fig : eb ] , see dashed curves .",
    "the reason for such difference is obvious : figure  [ fig : cn](a ) clearly demonstrates the importance of taking into account higher e - h pair states for proper description of the d - i crossover of the x - gs , and in particular the role in such crossover of state @xmath95 which is missing in the ssb calculation .",
    "this state is a direct pair state ( at least for @xmath178kv / cm ) , so that neglecting it in the x - gs calculation , as done e.g. in ref . , underestimates the exciton binding energy by a factor of 1.5 and the exciton radiative linewidth by an order of magnitude",
    "nevertheless , at larger efs ( @xmath179kv / cm ) the ssb model adequately describes the properties of the x - gs as such an indirect exciton state is strongly dominated by @xmath91 .    ]",
    "finally , fig.9 shows our simulation for an asymmetric in@xmath180ga@xmath173as / gaas / in@xmath174ga@xmath175as ( 10nm/4nm/10 nm ) cqw structure used in ref .  .",
    "as expected , the energy spectra are asymmetric with respect to the ef direction . in the right part of the exciton energy spectrum [ fig.9(a ) ] , at around 16kv / cm , a coulomb - induced anticrossing is observed , which is similar to that seen in fig.4 at @xmath149kv / cm . the physical mechanism which causes this anticrossing is essentially the same as in the case of symmetric cqws , but the anticrossing takes place at much higher values of the electric field .",
    "this is because at around @xmath176kv / cm ( 4 - 5kv / cm below the anticrossing ) the applied ef almost compensates the asymmetry in the conduction band structure , and thus at this value of @xmath7 the properties of the asymmetric cqw can resemble those of the symmetric cqw at @xmath147 .",
    "in fact , a repulsion of the electron subbands is seen in fig.9(b ) as well as a formation of symmetric and antisymmetric electronic states , as is clear from the inset in fig.9(a ) .",
    "a cqw exciton can escape from the system using the following two major channels : it can either recombine by emitting a photon or the electron and/or hole can tunnel through the external barrier with the help of the ef .",
    "we concentrate here on the x - gs only , and combining both channels together , the total exciton lifetime takes the form @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the exciton radiative lifetime . as for the tunneling time @xmath183",
    ", we take into account the lowest pair state only .",
    "this is a valid approximation because when other pair states contribute to the x - gs and thus can have some effect on the exciton tunneling , its lifetime is strongly dominated by the radiative channel as can be seen in fig.[fig : taur ] . in particular ,",
    "the tunneling lifetime @xmath184 is much longer than the radiative one up to @xmath185kv / cm .",
    "the d - i crossover of the x - gs is accompanied by a monotonous growth of its radiative lifetime , in accordance with fig.8(d ) . indeed , a direct exciton has a short lifetime because the carriers are in the same well , so that they can easily recombine .",
    "increasing the electron - hole separation leads to a dramatic increase of the radiative lifetime .",
    "the probability of the electron and hole tunneling also increases with ef . at some point",
    "the tunneling time becomes comparable to the radiative lifetime and then starts to dominate .",
    "we have also compared the calculated radiative lifetime for the x - gs with the experimental results taken from ref . where the low - temperature excitonic photoluminescence was measured in 848 nm gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as cqws .",
    "the inset to fig.[fig : taur ] demonstrates a quantitative agreement between the experiment and the present theory .",
    "we also calculate the exciton absorption coefficient in a 848 nm gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as cqw at different frequencies of the incoming light . using the lorentzian model of absorbing oscillators@xcite and leaving out a common prefactor",
    ", the absorption of the exciton with zero in - plane momentum takes the form @xmath186 where the index @xmath187 labels all possible excitonic states calculated in the theory , and @xmath188 and @xmath189 stand for their energies and radiative linewidths .    ]    figure  [ fig : absg](a ) shows the absorption spectrum calculated using eq.([abs ] ) and in - plane exciton confinement radius @xmath190 nm . all lines in the absorption have very narrow radiative widths ( @xmath191mev ) which are calculated according to eqs.([osc ] ) and ( [ rad ] ) .",
    "the lorentzian model however has an obvious artefact : although the spectrum properly reproduces the linewidths , all lines have the same peak height , and the fact that not all of them are seen in fig.[fig : absg](a ) is only due to the resolution of the plot . to improve on this and also to take into account the effect of inhomogeneous line broadening in realistic cqw structures , we make a gauss convolution of the spectrum : @xmath192 with a normalized gauss function @xmath193 . the convoluted spectrum with the full width at half maximum @xmath194mev is shown in fig.[fig : absg](b ) .",
    "all lines now have almost the same width but their peak maxima now reflect the optical strength of the corresponding exciton states .    the two lowest excitonic states , x - gs and x - es , are well resolved in the spectrum up to @xmath149kv / cm",
    ". then the indirect exciton x - gs loses its optical activity .",
    "the bright direct x - es line superimposes with higher ess and discretized continuum of the indirect exciton , all line merging up together at higher efs .",
    "we have provided a freely available on - line software@xcite which calculates the optical properties of the direct and indirect excitons in a cqw structure in a perpendicular ef .",
    "the software has a user - friendly interface and produces an on - screen output of the requested calculation as well as a pdf version of the same data and plots . for the input",
    ", the user has an option either to choose a symmetric algaas cqw inserting required structural parameters ( @xmath195 , @xmath196 , and @xmath197 ) , or to take other semiconductor cqw by inserting its structural and material parameters .",
    "the value of the ef is also needed for the input . in this numerical code",
    ", we use four basis states for the exciton wf , taking into account only the ground and the first excited states for the electron and hole .",
    "the exciton confinement radius is set to @xmath142 nm . the transition energies and the oscillator strengths of exciton excited states are also included in the output file .",
    "the absorption spectrum is calculated with 0.1mev fwhm gaussian convolution .",
    "we have studied the effect the electric field has on excitonic states in algaas and ingaas cqws . to do this",
    "we have developed an efficient numerical approach which is based on expanding the exciton wave function into uncorrelated electron - hole pair states and solving in the real space a matrix schrdinger equation for the cqw exciton . using this approach",
    "we have calculated the energies and the wave functions of exciton states in the cqw and studied their optical properties in the presence of electric field , by addressing such important parameters of the exciton as its binding energy , bohr radius , radiative and tunneling times , and optical absorption spectrum . while we are able to calculate a large number of exciton states , we have concentrated on two most important ones , the exciton ground state x - gs and the brightest excited state x - es .",
    "we have shown that the coulomb coupling between direct and indirect pair states leads to a prominent effect in the presence of the electric field : a direct - to - indirect crossover of the x - gs . at the same time , the properties of the x - es remain almost unchanged . finally , we have calculated the exciton lifetime which consists of two main components , radiative and tunneling times , and shown that the latter reduces the total lifetime at higher electric fields .",
