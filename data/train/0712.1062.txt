    ".    equation ( [ equation ] ) is the euler - lagrange pde corresponding to the energy functional @xmath14 equations of this type arise , e.g. , in models of superconductivity and superfluidity .",
    "additionally , ( [ equation ] ) is viewed as a complex - valued version of the allen - cahn model for phase transitions @xcite .",
    "solutions of ( [ equation ] ) subject to the dirichlet boundary condition , @xmath15 on @xmath16 with fixed @xmath17-valued boundary data @xmath18 , have been extensively studied in the past decade .",
    "special attention has been paid to solutions with isolated zeros ( vortices ) .",
    "in contrast with the dirichlet problem , in the case of the homogeneous neumann boundary condition , solutions are typically vortexless ; in particular , stable solutions with vortices have not been established .",
    "this work is devoted to solutions of ( [ equation ] ) subject to the  semi - stiff \" boundary conditions @xmath19 these boundary conditions are intermediate between dirichlet and neumann in the following sense : any solution @xmath20 of ( [ equation ] , [ boundary ] ) is sufficiently regular @xcite , so it can be written as @xmath21 ( locally ) near the boundary .",
    "then ( [ boundary ] ) means the dirichlet boundary condition is prescribed for the modulus , @xmath1 on @xmath16 , and the neumann condition is prescribed for the phase , @xmath22 on @xmath16 .",
    "problem ( [ equation ] , [ boundary ] ) is equivalent to finding critical points of the energy functional ( [ p1 ] ) in the space @xmath23 our main objective is to study the existence of _ stable _ solutions of ( [ equation ] , [ boundary ] ) with vortices .",
    "since the problem is time independent , stable solutions are defined as ( local ) minimizers of ( [ p1 ] ) in @xmath24 .",
    "in other words , we are interested in whether the model ( [ equation ] , [ boundary ] ) stabilizes vortices similarly to dirichlet problem or does not stabilize vortices analogously to neumann problem .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ boundary ] ) are not well studied , and this work , along with studies @xcite reveals their distinct features , described later in the introduction .",
    "let us briefly review the existing results for the dirichlet and neumann boundary value problems for equation ( [ equation ] ) .",
    "the first results on the existence of stable solutions with vortices for dirichlet problem were obtained in @xcite .",
    "stable solutions of ( [ equation ] ) with vortices were obtained and studied in @xcite for star - shaped domains and prescribed @xmath17-valued boundary data with nonzero topological degree . in @xcite ,",
    "the limiting locations ( as @xmath25 ) of vortices of globally minimizing and other solutions ( if they exist ) are described by means of a _",
    "renormalized energy_. subsequently , these results were generalized for multiply connected domains in @xcite .",
    "the existence of locally minimizing and minmax solutions was established first in @xcite and @xcite , then in more detail and generality in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , and references therein , for the dirichlet problem s various results . as previously mentioned , only vortexless stable solutions of ( [ equation ] ) with the homogeneous neumann boundary condition in 2d are known .",
    "moreover , all locally minimizing solutions are constant maps if @xmath9 is convex @xcite , or simply connected and @xmath2 is small @xcite .",
    "the existence of nonconstant ( but vortexless ) locally minimizing solutions is established in @xcite and @xcite . in the recent work @xcite ,",
    "a general result for the existence of ( nonminimizing ) solutions with vortices was obtained .",
    "similarly to the dirichlet problem , these solutions with vortices have energy that blows up as @xmath25 .",
    "equation ( [ equation ] ) ( functional ( [ p1 ] ) ) is usually referred to as a simplified gl model ( without magnetic field ) .",
    "there is a large body of mathematical literature on the general gl model with a magnetic field ( e.g. , @xcite ) . since ( [ equation ] )",
    "is obtained from the general gl energy by setting the magnetic field to zero , it describes persistent currents in a 2d cross - section of a cylindrical superconductor ( or in a 2d film ) .",
    "it was observed in @xcite , the degree of the boundary data on connected components of @xmath16 creates the same type of `` quantized vortices '' as a magnetic field in type ii superconductors or as angular rotation in superfluids . despite a relatively simple form of equation ( [ equation ] )",
    ", it leads to a deep analysis of properties of its solutions similar to other fundamental pde s in mathematical physics .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ boundary ] ) model , e.g. , the surface of a superconductor coated with a high temperature superconducting thin film @xcite .",
    "generating a mathematical model of persistent currents in such a superconductor , then amounts to finding critical points of functional ( [ p1 ] ) in the space @xmath24 , when @xmath26 on the boundary and @xmath1 , while the phase @xmath27 is `` free '' .",
    "boundary conditions ( [ boundary ] ) appeared in recent studies @xcite of the minimization problem for the gl functional ( [ p1 ] ) among maps from @xmath24 with prescribed degrees on the connected components of the boundary .",
    "the minimization of the energy ( [ p1 ] ) in @xmath24 produces only constant solutions of ( [ equation ] , [ boundary ] ) , similar to the case of the neumann problem , which corresponds to finding critical points of ( [ p1 ] ) in the entire space @xmath28 . an obvious way of producing critical points with vortices is to impose two different degrees @xmath29 on @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "that is , to consider the minimization of @xmath32 in the set @xmath33 , where @xmath34 recall that the degree ( winding number ) of a map @xmath35 on @xmath36 ( where @xmath36 is either @xmath37 or @xmath38 ) is an integer given by the classical formula ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath39 where the integral is understood via @xmath40 duality , and @xmath41 is the tangential derivative with respect to the counterclockwise orientation of @xmath36 .",
    "( throughout the paper we assume the same orientation of @xmath37 and @xmath42 . )",
    "note that @xmath43 are connected components of @xmath24 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "simple topological considerations imply that critical points from @xmath43 must have at least @xmath44 ( with multiplicity ) vortices .",
    "we emphasize that the existence of such critical points is far from obvious .",
    "for example ( see section [ section2 ] ) , there are no global minimizers of @xmath32 in @xmath45 and the weak limits of minimizing sequences do not belong to @xmath45 .",
    "this simple example illustrates an important property of the sets @xmath43 , which is crucial for our consideration : _ these sets are not weakly @xmath4-closed _ , since the degree at the boundary may change in the limit . on the other hand , the results of this work",
    "show that when @xmath46 and there is no topological reason for vortices to appear , local minimizers typically do have vortices .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the vortex structure of solutions of ( [ equation ] ) with dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions is well studied .",
    "in contrast , only vortexless solutions of the semi - stiff problem ( [ equation ] ) , ( [ boundary ] ) were found @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that minimizing sequences for the corresponding minimization problem develop a novel type of so - called `` near - boundary '' vortices , which approach the boundary and have finite gl energy in the limit of small @xmath2 ( due to the ghost vortices , see appendix a ) .",
    "however , such minimizing sequences do not converge to actual minimizers @xcite .",
    "these studies lead to the natural question of whether there exist true solutions of ( [ equation ] , [ boundary ] ) with near - boundary vortices . unlike the minimizing sequences such solutions may model observable states of a physical system ( e.g. , persistent currents with vortices and superfluids between rotating cylinders @xcite ) . the following theorem , which is the main result of this work , provides the answer to this question .    [ semistiffsolutions ] for any integer @xmath47 ,",
    "there exist at least @xmath48 distinct stable solutions of ( [ equation ] , [ boundary ] ) with ( nearboundary ) vortices when @xmath49 @xmath50 .",
    "the vortices of these solutions are at distance @xmath51 from the boundary and have bounded gl energy in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "the solutions are stable in the sense that they are ( local ) minimizers of ( [ p1 ] ) in @xmath24 .    to construct local minimizers of ( [ p1 ] ) in @xmath24",
    ", we represent @xmath24 as the union of subsets @xmath52 ( defined in ( [ setjpqd ] ) below ) , @xmath53 , and study the existence of global minimizers in @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , we show that each minimizer lies in @xmath52 with its open neighborhood .",
    "therefore , the minimizers in @xmath52 are distinct local minimizers in @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the construction of solutions of ( [ equation ] , [ boundary ] ) is based on the study of the following constrained minimization problem : @xmath54 where @xmath55\\},\\ ] ] @xmath56,@xmath57 and @xmath58 are given integers , and @xmath59 is the _ approximate bulk degree _ , introduced as follows .",
    "consider the boundary value problem @xmath60 introduce @xmath61 by the formula @xmath62 where @xmath63 solves ( [ capacitysolution ] ) .",
    "in the particular case where @xmath9 is a circular annulus , @xmath64 , @xmath59 is expressed by @xmath65    for @xmath17-valued maps , @xmath59 becomes integer valued and representation ( [ 1.9 ] ) clarifies its interpretation as an average value of the standard degree .",
    "the definition ( [ adeg ] ) is motivated by the following intuitive consideration : represent the standard degree over the boundary @xmath42 via a `` bulk '' integral over the area of @xmath9 for @xmath17-valued maps and notice that if @xmath66 for some finite @xmath67 and sufficiently small @xmath2 , then @xmath7 is `` almost '' @xmath17-valued .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that for @xmath17-valued maps in an annulus @xmath9 , one can define the topological degree @xmath68 that classifies maps @xmath69 according to their @xmath70-homotopy type @xcite ( @xmath70-homotopy type is completely determined by the degree of the restriction to a nontrivial contour ) .",
    "this definition was relaxed in @xcite for maps that are not necessarily @xmath17-valued by considering @xmath71 in a subdomain @xmath72 , which is obtained by removing neighborhoods of the boundary @xmath16 and zeros ( vortices ) of @xmath7",
    ". definition ( [ 1.9 ] ) does not require the removal of vortices from @xmath9 , and @xmath73 is obtained by a simple formula ( unlike @xmath68 in @xcite , where the domain of integration depends on @xmath7 ) .",
    "note that in general @xmath59 is not an integer .",
    "the most important fact for our consideration is that @xmath59 is continuous with respect to weak @xmath4-convergence , unlike the standard degree in ( [ def_degree ] ) ( this issue for @xmath74 was not addressed in @xcite ) .",
    "the minimization in problem ( [ constrainedminimization ] ) is taken over @xmath75 , which is not an open set , and therefore minimizers of ( [ constrainedminimization ] ) ( if they exist ) are not necessarily local minimizers of ( [ p1 ] ) in @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , while @xmath43 is an open subset of @xmath24 ( hereafter we assume the topology and convergence in @xmath24 to be the strong @xmath4 unless otherwise is specified ) , the constraint @xmath76 $ ] defines a closed set with respect to both strong and weak @xmath4-convergences .",
    "however , if we further consider a subset of maps with bounded energy and choose @xmath2 small enough , then the constraint @xmath76 $ ] becomes open thanks to the following proposition :    [ openconstraint ] fix @xmath77 .",
    "there exists @xmath78 such that if @xmath79 , then for any integer @xmath58 and any @xmath20 satisfying @xmath80 the closed constraint @xmath76 $ ] is equivalent to an open one that is , @xmath81    the following theorem is the main tool in proving existence of local minimizers .",
    "[ mainth ] for any integers @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) with @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) there exists @xmath86 such that the infimum in ( [ constrainedminimization ] ) is always attained , when @xmath49 .",
    "moreover @xmath87 where @xmath88 the value @xmath89 is expressed by @xmath90 via the @xmath4-capacity @xmath91 of the domain @xmath9 .",
    "the key difficulty is to establish the attainability of the infimum in ( [ constrainedminimization ] ) , which is highly nontrivial since the degree on @xmath30 and @xmath31 is not preserved in the weak @xmath4-limit @xcite .",
    "we show solutions of ( [ equation ] , [ boundary ] ) , which are minimizers of ( [ constrainedminimization ] ) ( local minimizers of ( [ p1 ] ) in @xmath24 ) with @xmath92 and any @xmath57 ( or @xmath93 and any @xmath56 ) must have vortices . for fixed @xmath2 ,",
    "these vortices are located at a positive distance from @xmath16 and approach @xmath16 as @xmath25 .    without loss of generality , throughout this work we always assume that @xmath82 ( otherwise one can reverse the orientation of @xmath8 ) .    theorem [ semistiffsolutions ] follows from theorem [ mainth ] and proposition [ openconstraint ] .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the local minimizers is established in    [ asymptoticth ] assume that the integers @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 satisfy the assumptions of theorem [ mainth ] .",
    "then as @xmath25 minimizers of ( [ constrainedminimization ] ) converge weakly in @xmath94 , up to a subsequence , to a harmonic map @xmath7 which minimizes ( [ s^1minimization ] ) . additionally , @xmath95",
    "@xmath96    in particular , it follows from ( [ asymptoticforenergy1 ] , [ asymptoticforenergy2 ] ) that there is no strong convergence of minimizers of ( [ constrainedminimization ] ) in @xmath94 as @xmath97 unless @xmath98 .",
    "next , we summarize the distinct features of the gl boundary value problem with semi - stiff boundary conditions .",
    "the first interesting feature is the existence of solutions with a new type of vortices called _ near - boundary vortices_. unlike the inner vortices , whose energy blows up at the rate of @xmath99 , the energy of near - boundary vortices is bounded as @xmath3 and they are located at a distance @xmath51 from the boundary .",
    "secondly , the semi - stiff boundary conditions result in a lack of compactness .",
    "namely , as of now , the only way to find nonconstant minimizers is by searching for minimizers in subsets @xmath100 .",
    "these subsets , however , are not weakly @xmath4-closed and therefore a weak @xmath4-limit of a minimizing sequence @xmath101 may not lie in @xmath75 , but rather in @xmath102 with @xmath103 or ( and ) @xmath104 .",
    "theorem [ mainth ] shows that if @xmath82 and @xmath84 , then ( for small @xmath2 ) any weak @xmath4-limit of a _ minimizing sequence _ @xmath105 always belongs to @xmath75 , despite the lack of weak @xmath4-closeness of @xmath75 .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath106 and @xmath107 we have    let @xmath106 , @xmath107 ( or @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) and let @xmath7 be a weak limit of a minimizing sequence for problem ( [ constrainedminimization ] ) ( such a minimizing sequence exists and bound ( [ add ] ) holds for any integer @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , see appendix b ) .",
    "then @xmath110 when @xmath2 is sufficiently small .    in the simplest case , when @xmath111 and either @xmath112 and @xmath113 or @xmath114 and @xmath115 , this conjecture is demonstrated by an argument quite similar to the nonexistence proof in @xcite for simply connected domains",
    "( see sec.[section2 ] below ) .",
    "a more interesting example , which supports the above conjecture , follows from the previously studied ( global ) minimization problem @xmath116 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath117 ( subcritical / critical cases ) , then @xmath118 is always attained , whereas if @xmath119 ( supercritical case ) , then @xmath118 is never attained for small @xmath2 .",
    "one can see elements of minimizing sequences lie in @xmath120 in subcritical / critical cases and in @xmath121 in the supercritical case . moreover , the nonexistence of minimizers in problem ( [ constrainedminimization ] ) for @xmath111 , @xmath122 and small @xmath2 holds for any doubly connected domain ( with any capacity ) .",
    "( for @xmath119 the proof is presented in @xcite , this proof can be easily generalized for @xmath117 . )",
    "we conclude the introduction by outlining the scheme of the proof of theorem [ mainth ] , which employs a comparison argument .",
    "fix an integer @xmath82 .",
    "first , we establish the existence of minimizers in problem ( [ constrainedminimization ] ) for @xmath98 by using the so - called price lemma @xcite ( see lemma [ pricelemma ] below ) , the uniform lower energy bound from lemma [ roughlowerbound ] and the upper bound from lemma [ ochenprostayalemma ] , which is obtained by considering @xmath17-valued testing maps .",
    "we show these minimizers ( which belong to @xmath123 ) are vortexless .",
    "next , we argue by induction on the parameter @xmath124 . this parameter is naturally associated with the number of vortices for example , for the above minimizers in @xmath123 , we have @xmath125 . given an integer @xmath126 , we assume the existence of minimizers in problem ( [ constrainedminimization ] ) for @xmath56 , @xmath57 such that , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , @xmath129 ( the induction hypothesis ) and prove the existence of minimizers for @xmath56 , @xmath57 such that @xmath130 and @xmath128 , @xmath129 .",
    "the first step in the induction procedure ( when @xmath131 ) is shown in section [ section5 ] .",
    "the key technical point there is to construct a testing map @xmath132 such that @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a minimizer of ( [ p1 ] ) in @xmath135 .",
    "this map @xmath136 is constructed by using the minimizer @xmath134 and m@xmath137bius conformal maps ( blashke factor @xcite ) on the unit disk with a prescribed single zero near the boundary .",
    "then , given a minimizing sequence @xmath138 of problem ( [ constrainedminimization ] ) for @xmath139 , @xmath140 , we have , by ( [ price2 ] ) from lemma [ [ pricelemma ] ] and ( [ short1 ] ) , @xmath141 where u is a weak @xmath4-limit of @xmath142 ( possibly a subsequence ) . then we estimate the left hand side of ( [ short2 ] ) by the lower energy bound from lemma [ roughlowerbound ] and the right hand side of ( [ short2 ] ) by the upper bound from lemma [ ochenprostayalemma ] , this yields @xmath143 this implies that @xmath144 , and either @xmath145 or @xmath146 . in view of ( [ short2 ] ) ,",
    "the only possible case is actually @xmath145 since , otherwise , @xmath147 and therefore @xmath148 which contradicts ( [ short2 ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath149 and is a minimizer in @xmath150 .",
    "the proof of existence of minimizers for @xmath151 , @xmath152 is quite similar .",
    "so we have shown that the existence of minimizers for @xmath153 implies the existence of minimizers for @xmath154 . in the general case ,",
    "when passing from @xmath127 to @xmath155 in problem ( [ constrainedminimization ] ) , we use the same idea but it is technically much more involved . it requires the asymptotic analysis as @xmath25 of minimizers @xmath156 of ( [ constrainedminimization ] ) with @xmath157 , which is carried out in section [ section6 ] . based on the result of this asymptotic analysis , we construct testing maps @xmath158 ( @xmath159 , @xmath160 or @xmath159 , @xmath160 ) , such that @xmath161 .",

    "let us show that , for any integers @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , the set of admissible testing maps in problem ( [ constrainedminimization ] ) is not empty and @xmath834 to this end chose two sequences @xmath835 such that @xmath836 , @xmath837 .",
