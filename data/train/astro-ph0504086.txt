    "vega ( @xmath11 lyrae = hd 172167 = hr 7001 , a0 v , d=7.76 pc ) has been used both as a fundamental photometric standard and as a template for modeling of stellar atmospheres .",
    "one of the highlights of the _ iras _ mission was the discovery of a large infrared excess around vega , which was observed originally as a photometric standard .",
    "the far infrared emission was attributed to thermal dust emission from a disk of debris orbiting the star @xcite .",
    "subsequent _ iras _ observations of other main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood found that nearly 15% of them exhibit infrared excesses @xcite .",
    "the dust found around these main sequence stars can not be primordial material left over from the star forming stage because the time scale to remove primordial material ( @xmath1210 myr ) is short compared to the lifetimes of these stars ( for example , vega is estimated as 350 myr old , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the dust must be re - supplied . second - generation dust in such systems",
    "is thought to arise primarily from collisions between planetesimals and from cometary activity .",
    "ground- and space - based observations of the nearest subsample of vega - like stars from optical to submillimeter wavelengths have revealed disk - like structures  debris disks  with density gaps and enhancements @xcite .",
    "debris disks are the most visible signposts of other planetary systems , representing indirect evidence of planetary system formation .",
    "we can learn about the diversity of planetary systems from the study of debris disk structures .",
    "vega is one of the closer and brighter debris disks , which provides us an opportunity to study it in detail spatially , as a foundation for understanding other debris disks .",
    "@xcite observed vega at 47 and 95 @xmath0  with the kuiper airborne observatory and inferred that the source of infrared emission may be as large as 23  in radius .",
    "@xcite re - analyzed the _ iras _ data and found that the _ iras _ 60 @xmath0  emission from vega is 18@xmath33  in radius .",
    "they also suggested that the emission at 60 @xmath0  is caused by small dust grains with size between 0.1 and 10 @xmath0 .",
    "_ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ observations show a smooth , resolved , face - on disk with a radius of 22@xmath32  at 60 @xmath0 , and 36@xmath33  at 90 @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "@xcite attempted to detect vega s disk through optical scattered light by using linear photopolarimetry .",
    "their upper limit implies that the debris around vega contains a very small number of 0.01 - 0.3 @xmath0  grains .",
    "@xcite detected emission by dust from vega at 800 @xmath0  and suggested the presence of 100 - 300 @xmath0  grains to account for the submillimeter observations .",
    "the 850 @xmath0  map of vega obtained by @xcite with the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope shows an extended , roughly circular structure with dimensions of 24@xmath621(@xmath32 ) .",
    "the 850 @xmath0  resolved emission is not uniformly distributed ; instead , there is an elongated bright central region oriented northeast - southwest with a bright peak offset @xmath49  ( 70 au ) to the northeast of the star s position .",
    "observations at 1.3 mm obtained by @xcite and by @xcite resolved dust emission peaks offset from the star by 8  to 14  that appear to be associated with a ring of emission at a radius of 60 to 95 au .    here",

    "the resolved images are discussed in  [ vega_morphologies ] .",

    "vega was imaged on 11 april 2004 with the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; @xcite ) .",
    "multiple dithered 3 sec exposures were obtained using the 24 , 70 ( both coarse and fine scales ) , and 160 @xmath0  channels .",
    "details about the observations are listed in table [ obslog ] along with the combined sensitivity at each band .",
    "the data were processed using the mips instrument team data analysis tool ( dat ; @xcite ) for basic reduction ( dark subtraction , flat fielding / illumination correction ) .",
    "in addition , the 24 @xmath0  images were processed to remove a vertical `` jail - bar '' pattern caused by the bright saturated central star . due to the known transient behaviors associated with the 70 @xmath0  detectors , a detector dependent structure in the coarse scale mode data",
    "was removed by subtracting column averages from each exposure with the source region masked .",
    "similar artifacts were taken out in the 70 @xmath0  fine mode data by subtracting the off - source chopped background observations .",
    "the processed exposures were then mosaicked together .",
    "the vega disk at 24 @xmath0  is tenuous compared to the very bright photosphere ( 7.4 jy ) .",
    "the existence of a very low surface brightness disk is best illustrated by examining the radial profile ( figure [ vega_radprof_a24 ] ) .",
    "relative to the observed point spread function ( psf ) scaled to vega s photospheric level , the observed radial profile lies consistently above the scaled point source profile .",
    "the contrast between the bright and dark airy rings in the image of vega is much lower , implying the brightness of the dark airy rings has been filled in by a low surface brightness , extended component .",
    "vega s photosphere contributes a significant fraction of the flux near the center of our images at both 24 and 70 @xmath0 , while the emission from vega s debris disk dominates most of the flux at 160 @xmath0 . to study the emission from vega s debris disk the photospheric contributions have to be removed in all three channels . to remove vega s photosphere ,",
    "we subtracted reference observed psfs , scaled to vega s photospheric flux , from our images . changing",
    "the psf scaling factor by more than 10% resulted in artifacts in the subtracted images at the position of the core of the psf and/or at the positions of the airy minima and maxima .",
    "we conclude that our photospheric removal is accurate to 10% within any given resolution element in the resulting photosphere - subtracted images .    at 24 @xmath0  we processed the data for a psf reference star ( hd 217382 ) in exactly the same way as we did for vega . because the central pixel in the vega images was saturated , registering the reference psf to the vega image was difficult .",
    "we took advantage of image latents present in both data sets to do the registration and photosphere subtraction on a frame - by - frame basis .",
    "we then mosaicked the resulting images to produce the final 24 @xmath0  image of vega s disk , shown in figure [ vegadisk_a24 ] .",
    "the mosaic does not show any saturation artifact at the center because of the sub - pixel dithers used in the observation : a pixel that was saturated in one image is partially overlapped by unsaturated neighboring pixels in an image from a different dither position .",
    "there were enough dither positions to provide partial coverage even at vega s position in the final mosaic . because of this in - filling of the saturated area , the effective exposure time in the central 6  is about half of that elsewhere .",
    "photospheric removal at 70 @xmath0  was more straight forward .",
    "we registered the scaled reference psf mosaic ( hd 48915 ) to the vega mosaic by centroiding , and subtracted .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ vegadisk_a70a ] ( coarse scale ) and [ vegadisk_a70b ] ( fine scale ) .",
    "the mips 160 @xmath0  array suffers from a spectral leak caused by an internal reflection in the optical train allowing leakage from very blue and bright rayleigh - jeans sources to contaminate the signals at 160 @xmath0 .",
    "however , the spectral leak image is offset to one side of the true 160 @xmath0  image , and the brightness of the leak is proportional to the photospheric flux .",
    "comparison of 160 @xmath0  images of stellar ( blue ) sources with images of asteroids shows that the near - infrared leak contributes very little to the 160 @xmath0  images on the opposite side of the source location .",
    "the predicted flux for vega s photosphere is 162 mjy , which is much fainter than the expected disk brightness at 160 @xmath0 .",
    "we took advantage of this situation by using only the half of the 160 @xmath0  image where the leak contribution is negligible .",
    "we also subtracted a scaled ( red ) 160 @xmath0  reference psf ( asteroid harmonia ) from the vega mosaic , using the pointing information ( accurate to @xmath13 1 ) to register .",

    "the relation between the _ iras _ quoted flux and actual flux is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the color correction factor .",
    "the color correction factor is 1.41 for t = 9750 k blackbody ( vega photosphere ) and 0.83 for t = 95 k ( debris disk as determined by previous studies ) , suggesting that the actual flux from the disk is @xmath4 1.4@xmath17 jy at 25 @xmath0 .",
    "vega s disk looks very similar in both 70 @xmath0  images .",
    "the fine scale data were taken in 12 dithered positions with sub - pixel offsets to provide a good spatial sampling for the disk .",

    "the disk image is circular at all wavelengths , suggesting a face - on disk .",
    "this behavior is consistent with vega being a pole - on star @xcite .",
    "based on previous studies ( _ iras , iso _ and scuba ) , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the disk can be characterized as a blackbody of t = 95 k with a @xmath21 emissivity .",
    "the fluxes measured by mips match the previously observed sed within 15% .",
    "a striking immediate result from the mips images is the physical size of the vega disk .",
    "submillimeter and millimeter observations show a low surface brightness ring with radius @xmath411 , much smaller than the emission seen in the mips bands .",
    "in contrast , mips images of the fomalhaut debris disk @xcite indicate that the submillimeter and far - infrared morphologies agree well .",
    "a second surprise is the presence of material warm enough to be detected in the mips bands at a large distance from the star .",
    "@xcite estimated the size of the disk if the grains are blown out by radiation pressure , and suggested that the disk could be up to a few thousand au , consistent with our images .",
    "because the disk is almost perfectly face - on , its extent can be best shown in an azimuthally averaged radial intensity profile .",
    "the advantage of using radial profiles is that the noise is reduced by @xmath22 , where n is the total number of pixels used in averaging the intensity at a given radius .",
    "the radial surface brightness profile of the disk at 24 @xmath0  is shown in figure [ rad24 ] .",

    "<S> we present high spatial resolution mid- and far - infrared images of the vega debris disk obtained with the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) . the disk is well resolved and its angular size is much larger than found previously . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of the disk is at least 43  ( 330 au ) , 70  ( 543 au ) , and 105  ( 815 au ) in extent at 24 , 70 and 160 @xmath0 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the disk images are circular , smooth and without clumpiness at all three wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the radial surface brightness profiles follow radial power laws of @xmath1 or @xmath2 , and imply an inner boundary at a radius of 11@xmath32  ( 86 au ) . assuming an amalgam of amorphous silicate and carbonaceous grains , the disk can be modeled as an axially symmetric and geometrically thin disk , viewed face - on , with the surface particle number density following an inverse radial power law . </S>",
    "<S> the disk radiometric properties are consistent with a range of models using grains of sizes @xmath41 to @xmath450 @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the exact minimum and maximum grain size limits depend on the adopted grain composition . however , all these models require a @xmath5 surface number density profile and a total mass of 3@xmath31.5@xmath610@xmath7 @xmath8 in grains . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a ring , containing grains larger than 180 @xmath0  and at radii of 86 - 200 au from the star , can reproduce the observed 850 @xmath0  flux , while its emission does not violate the observed mips profiles . </S>",
    "<S> this ring could be associated with a population of larger asteroidal bodies analogous to our own kuiper belt . </S>",
    "<S> cascades of collisions starting with encounters among these large bodies in the ring produce the small debris that is blown outward by radiation pressure to much larger distances where we detect its thermal emission . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively short lifetime ( @xmath9 years ) of these small grains and the observed total mass , @xmath43@xmath610@xmath7 @xmath8 , set a lower limit on the dust production rate , @xmath410@xmath10 g / s . </S>",
    "<S> this rate would require a very massive asteroidal reservoir for the dust to be produced in a steady state throughout vega s life . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we suggest that the disk we imaged is ephemeral and that we are witnessing the aftermath of a large and relatively recent collisional event , and subsequent collisional cascade . </S>"
