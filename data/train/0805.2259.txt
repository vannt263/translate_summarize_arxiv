    "early studies of the disks of spiral galaxies @xcite showed that this component generally follows an exponential radial surface - brightness profile , with a certain scale length , usually taken as the characteristic size of the disk .",
    "@xcite pointed out , though , that not all disks follow this simple exponential law .    another repeatedly reported feature of disks is that of a truncation of the stellar population at large radii , typically 2 - 4 exponential scale lengths ( see e.g. the review by * ? ? ?",
    "and @xcite first drew attention to this phenomenon , which they inferred primarily from the major axis profiles of edge - on , late - type spirals . though the term `` truncation '' is used , not even in the original studies was a complete absence of stars beyond the truncation radius suggested .",
    "in fact , @xcite showed that the truncation actually adopts the form of a fairly sharp change in slope , from the shallow exponential of the main disk to a steeper exponential at larger radii ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite denoted galaxies with this feature as type ii objects , generalizing a classification scheme initially proposed by @xcite .    though the truncation phenomenon appears to be very widespread",
    "( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter cited as pt06 ) , there are many cases in which this just does not appear to happen even at extremely faint surface brightness levels . to give an example",
    ", @xcite found ( using star counts ) a galaxy ( ngc 300 ) for which the single exponential decline simply continues down to @xmath4 10 radial scale lengths ( @xmath4 30.5 mag/@xmath5 in @xmath6 band ) . together with earlier measurements by e.g. @xcite or @xcite ( using surface photometry ) this provides evidence that indeed there are prototypical exponential disks ( type i objects , following nomenclature in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "more strikingly , perhaps , there even exists evidence for a third type of profile presented by @xcite for early - type disks , by @xcite and pt06 for late - type disks ; and for extreme late - type spirals by @xcite . in this class ,",
    "named `` type iii '' ( also `` antitruncations '' ) by @xcite , the inner profile is a relatively steep exponential , which gives way to a shallower profile , beyond the break radius .",
    "this profile is thus something like the `` inverse '' of a type ii profile , bending `` up '' instead of `` down '' beyond the break radius ( `` upbending '' profile ) .    in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the type ii galaxies .",
    "several possible break - forming mechanisms have been investigated to explain their truncations .",
    "there have been ideas based on maximum angular momentum distribution : @xcite proposed that angular momentum conservation in a collapsing , uniformly rotating cloud naturally gives rise to disk breaks at roughly 4.5 scale radii .",
    "suggested that the breaks are due to angular momentum cut - offs of the cooled gas . on the other hand ,",
    "breaks have also been attributed to a threshold for star formation ( sf ) , due to changes in the gas density @xcite , or to an absence of equilibrium in the cool interstellar medium phase @xcite . following this , and using a semi - analytic model",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that a double - exponential profile may arise from a multi - component star formation prescription .",
    "the above two `` simple '' scenarios ( angular momentum vs. star formation threshold ) , however , are challenged by observational results .",
    "it is becoming more and more clear that galaxies have a significant density of stars beyond the break radius .",
    "in addition , the existence of extended uv disks @xcite and the lack of a clear correlation between h@xmath7 cut - offs and optical disk breaks @xcite further complicates the picture .",
    "even though a sharp star formation or angular momentum cut - off may explain a disk truncation , it does not provide a compelling explanation for extended outer exponential components .",
    "more elaborate models such as that by @xcite demonstrated that the redistribution of angular momentum by spirals during bar formation also produces realistic breaks , using collisionless n - body simulations . in a further elaboration of this idea ,",
    "@xcite have performed high resolution simulations of the formation of a galaxy embedded in a dark matter halo ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are able to reproduce type ii profiles , which they claim to be in good agreement with observations . in their model",
    ", breaks are the result of the interplay between a radial star formation cut - off and redistribution of stellar mass by secular processes .    independently of the formation mechanism of the truncation",
    ", it seems reasonable to assume that the structural properties of the faintest regions of galactic disks must be intimately linked to the processes involved in the growing and shaping of galaxies .",
    "these outer edges are easily affected by interactions with other galaxies and , consequently , their characteristics must be closely connected with the evolutionary paths followed by the galaxies @xcite .",
    "together with their stellar halos , the study of the outer edges allows the exploration of the `` fossil '' evidence imprinted by the galaxy formation process @xcite .",
    "furthermore , addressing the question of how the radial truncation evolves with z is strongly linked to our understanding of how the galactic disks grow and where star formation takes place .",
    "@xcite showed that it is possible to detect stellar truncations even out to @xmath8 . using the radial position of the truncation ( hereafter @xmath9 ) as a direct estimator of the size of the stellar disk ,",
    "@xcite inferred a moderate ( @xmath1025% ) inside - out growth of disk galaxies since @xmath8 .",
    "an important point , however was missing in the previous analyses : the evolution with redshift of the radial position of the break at a given stellar mass .",
    "the stellar mass is a much better parameter to explore the growth of galaxies , since the luminosity evolution of the stellar populations can mimic a size evolution @xcite . addressing this point here",
    ", one aim of the present work is to probe whether the galaxies are growing from the inside outwards , with star formation propagating radially outward with time .",
    "another point to mention is that while @xcite , worked with imaging data from the ultra deep field @xcite , we make use of goods - hst / acs data @xcite . this field provides a much wider sky coverage , and so increases the size of the sample under study by roughly an order of magnitude , though at the cost of using images with somewhat lower signal to noise ratio .",
    "we take care to tackle the implications of this caveat in the paper as well .    in this work ( to",
    "which we will refer hereinafter as atb08 ) we also broach other issues relative to the detailed characterization of the surface brightness profiles ( @xmath11-rprofiles ) .",
    "we present results on the distribution of the @xmath2-band rest - frame surface brightness at the position of the break ( hereafter @xmath12 ) .",
    "we discuss the distribution of the ratio @xmath9/ @xmath13 , where @xmath13is the scale length of the disk in the region inner to the break .",
    "also included are results on the relation between @xmath13and absolute magnitude and stellar mass .",
    "finally , for the first time in this kind of studies , we make extended analysis of the profiles of simulated galaxies , in an attempt to better limit the accuracy of the reported figures .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe the galaxy sample and give a brief description of the imaging data we use . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we describe how we obtained the radial surface - brightness profiles of the galaxies , and the methodology of the analysis we apply for their characterization .",
    "section [ sec4 ] is focused on the completeness of the samples under study and assessing the accuracy level of the parameters retrieved .",
    "section [ sec5 ] presents results on classification and characterization of the @xmath11-rprofiles , and more extensive analysis of how the break radii of type ii disks relate to various other properties of the galaxies at different redshifts . in section [ sec6 ]",
    "we summarize our results and conclusions .",
    "finally we include an appendix on the description and analysis of results from an exercise of classification of profiles performed on a sample of artificial model _ galaxies_. throughout , we assume a flat @xmath14-dominated cosmology ( @xmath15 = 0.30 , @xmath16=0.70 , and @xmath17=70 km @xmath18 @xmath19 ) .",
    "we have worked with objects present in imaging data from hst - acs observations of the goods - south field @xcite , which subtends an area in the sky of roughly 170 square arcmin .",
    "these data are publicly available , and consist of imaging in the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 hst pass - bands , hereafter referred to as @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26and @xmath27 , and whose total exposure times are approximately 7200 , 3040 , 3040 , and 6280 seconds , respectively .",

    "the combo-17 team made this information publicly available through a catalog with precise redshift estimates ( with errors @xmath29@xmath0/(1+@xmath0)@xmath40.02 ) for approximately 9000 galaxies down to @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "in the same data release were included rest - frame absolute magnitudes and colors ( accurate to @xmath4 0.1 mag ) .",
    "we have also used the stellar mass estimates published in @xcite , which are taken from @xcite , and are deduced from the combo-17 photometric data .",
    "@xcite conducted the morphological analysis of the late - type galaxies in the gems field by fitting srsic @xmath31 @xcite profiles to the surface brightness distributions .",
    "@xcite showed that using the srsic index @xmath32 as the criterion , it is feasible to distinguish between late- and early - type galaxies at intermediate redshifts . late - types ( sab - sdm ) are defined as having @xmath32@xmath12 - 2.5 .",
    "moreover , the morphological analysis conducted by barden et al . provides the information about the inclination of the galaxies .",
    "this is particularly important , since we want to study the truncation of the stellar disks in objects with low inclination .",
    "the edge - on view facilitates the discovery of truncations but introduces severe quantitative problems caused by the effects of dust and line - of - sight integration which we want to avoid @xcite .",
    "we selected objects from the barden et al .",

    "moreover , only objects with @xmath0@xmath11.1 were selected in order to maintain our analysis in the optical rest - frame bands .",
    "finally the resulting sample was matched to a photometric catalog derived by ourselves from the goods - south hst - acs data ( goods data hereafter ) , using sextractorband which had at least 16 contiguous pixels ( 0.014 @xmath5 ) at an isophotal level of 0.6 sky @xmath37 ( 25.35 mag/@xmath5 ) or higher .",
    "these photometry parameters are the same employed by the goods teams for producing their catalogs .",
    "nonetheless , we wanted to have segmentation maps for each object , as produced by sextractor , but the goods team did not release these files , and so we had to do our own , though equivalent , photometry ] @xcite .",
    "the resulting sample contains 505 objects .",
    "to analyse the surface brightness profiles of our galaxies in a similar rest - frame band within the explored redshift range ( 0.1@xmath1@xmath0@xmath11.1 ) , we have extracted the profiles in the following bands : @xmath25 band for galaxies with 0.1@xmath1@xmath0@xmath280.5 , @xmath26 band for 0.5@xmath1@xmath0@xmath280.8 , and @xmath27 band for 0.8@xmath1@xmath0@xmath281.1 .",
    "this allows us to explore the surface brightness distribution in a wavelength close to the @xmath2-band rest - frame .",
    "the surface brightness ( @xmath11-r ) profiles were extracted using photometry on quasi - isophotal elliptical apertures . the intensities were estimated as the median of the flux in the area between elliptical apertures of increasing semi major axis length ( hereafter we will dub these lengths as `` radii '' ) .",
    "the ellipticity and position angle of the apertures were fixed to those retrieved by sextractor for the whole distribution of light of the object .",
    "the center of the apertures was also fixed : in a first iteration , the first moments ( in ` @xmath38 ' and ` @xmath39 ' ) of the brightness distribution of flux of the object were used for this purpose . after visual inspection of the resulting profile and the image of the object , the center was refined , if needed , with help of the task `` imexam '' from iraf to match what was visually estimated , in each case , as the dynamical center of the object . in a regular disk galaxy ,",
    "as are those under study , this center coincides with the central bulge or nucleus .",
    "the radii of the annular apertures was linearly increased at constant steps of 1 pixel ( 0.03  ) , up to a radius which is a 50% larger than the radius of a circle with the same area as the isophotal area of the object in the @xmath27 band , as given by sextractor .",
    "the isophotal area is that covered by the set of connected pixels with intensities above the detection threshold which constitute a detection ( in our case 25.4 mag/@xmath5 in @xmath27 ) . for objects with a more or less regular morphology , as are those selected , the median intensities in these annulii are a good approximation to isophotal intensities .",
    "the error in the intensity , @xmath29i , is given by the @xmath37 of the distribution of fluxes inside the annulus , divided by the square root of the corresponding pixel area .",
    "the intensities ( `` @xmath40 '' ) were transformed to surface brightnesses ( @xmath11 ) , expressed in mag/@xmath5 in the ab system , using the magnitude zero points posted on the goods - hst / acs website for each filter and the angular scale per pixel , through the expression @xmath41 .",
    "for the errors in @xmath11 , @xmath42 , the formula used was @xmath42 = 2.5 @xmath43 log ( 1 + @xmath29@xmath40/@xmath40 ) . in producing these profiles , sextractor ,",
    "ds9 and iraf software packages were used , `` glued '' together by a script written by ourselves in `` python '' language .",
    "we produced radial profiles , and characterized them in terms of the properties of the exponential laws which best fit them .",
    "for each object , the image and profile obtained are visually inspected .",
    "if the object is affected by artifacts ( which mostly occurs near the edges of the area of the goods - hst - acs field ) , or the object is suspected of being a merger , or has an irregular morphology , or the object is between two tiles of the survey , or part of the object lies outside the field , the object is rejected for further analysis . from the initial 505 objects ,",
    "70 were rejected for these reasons ( 14% ) .    for those objects which are suitable for analysis ,",
    "the profile was tested for the existence of breaks of any kind , trying the 3 methods we describe next and comparing results , and also by visually judging the apparent morphology of the galaxy .",
    "if no break is apparent ( type i ) , the profile is fitted to a single exponential .",
    "if there is a break , it is characterized by using one of the two following methods .",
    "the first , which we call the `` intersection method '' , was the most commonly applied .",
    "it was used in 84% of the 289 objects which show a `` break '' ( i.e. types ii and iii ) . in this method two",
    "exponentials were independently fitted to non overlapping sections of the profile .",
    "the point of intersection of the two lines gives the break radius , @xmath9 , while the surface brightness on the profile , linearly interpolated at that radius , is the surface brightness at the break , @xmath12 .",
    "the radial scales of the exponentials ( @xmath13and @xmath44 ) are used to distinguish between types ii ( @xmath13@xmath34 @xmath44 ) and iii ( @xmath13@xmath1 @xmath44 ) .    in 47 cases ( 16% of the objects which show a break ) ,",
    "a slightly more involved process is required to measure the position and brightness of the break .",
    "we have found some objects which show a change in slope of some type ( mostly ii , but also iii ) , in which there is a smaller zone between the 2 exponential regions with a different slope from the other two more extended zones .",
    "an example of this phenomenology is shown in fig .",
    "[ figjump ] . if the length of this intermediate zone were increased , and if its slope were constant , it would be classified as a `` mixed '' type ( ii+iii or iii+ii , * ? ? ?",
    "* pt06 ) , but we refer here to those cases in which the radial extent of this intermediate zone is so small that it seems to be showing a specific morphology . measuring the position of the break in these ( from now on in this paper ) termed `` jump truncations '' , can not be done with the `` intersection method '' . in these cases ,",
    "the intersection point does not match the point at which there is the change of slope in the profile , as seen in fig .",
    "[ figjump ] .",
    "instead , we use the `` equal deviation '' ( ed ) method , which we have devised for this purpose .",
    "it consists in locating the position of the break at the point in which the inner and outer fit lines , are at a maximum and equal distance ( in @xmath11 ) from the intensity profile . in most cases , there are usually two points of the profile which are at a same distance from the fits .",
    "one is the point of intersection of the inner and outer fit lines ( a meaningless position in these cases ) , and the other is the point of interest , the point at which the change in slope appears to happen . by selecting the point at which the distances are equal and of maximum absolute value ,",
    "the required point is usually naturally selected . only in some cases , with more irregular profiles , the region in which we search for the points of equal deviation",
    "must be limited to find a meaningful solution .",
    "if we apply this method to a profile in which there is normal break , i.e. without a `` jump '' , the same solution is obtained by this method as with the standard intersection technique .",
    "it is important to note that this method is used only to measure the radius of the break ( understood as the change in the slope of the profiles ) with greater accuracy .",
    "we think that , at this point , and for the stated purposes , it is not necessary to speculate about the causes for these `` jump truncations '' .",
    "our standpoint is to consider them as irregularities in the profiles which make the task of estimating the position of the `` break '' more involved than in most other cases . in analysing the profiles we adopt the following assumption .",
    "a `` break '' in a stellar disk is a significant discontinuity in the slope of the exponential profile .",
    "this significance comes from both the change in slope and the permanence of the change at increasing radii . bearing this in mind ,",
    "the position of the break should be placed at the point where the change in slope takes place , and not where the lines which best fit the two subsections of the profile intersect , if these two positions do not coincide , as is the case for the `` jump truncations '' .",
    "+ taking into account that stellar disks have their irregularities and asymmetries , it might be argued that perhaps other profile analysis techniques would be better fitted to our goals .",
    "for example , using averages of profiles in different sectors of the galaxies , instead of the complete azimuthal profiles , might be helpful to indicate problems in individual extracted profiles .",
    "three are the main reasons which make us prefer the adopted methodology .",
    "first , our profiles are not azimuthally averaged , but we extract median values of intensity , so minimizing the relevance of asymmetries on the resulting intensity profiles .",
    "second , averaging profiles in sectors would cause a severe decrease in the limiting surface brightness which could be analysed . for many cases , this could imply that we would not be able to measure the truncations . and third , selecting the sectors could add a bias which could compromise the statistical significance of the results .",
    "the complete list of objects ( 505 ) , with detailed results of the profile classification and characterization , is given in table [ tblresults ] .",
    "also listed are the objects which were rejected for analysis .",
    "these have no information on classification , and the reason for rejection is given in the last column .",
    "we will discuss the results in the following sections .",
    "the selection criterion employed for the absolute b magnitude ( @xmath36@xmath1 -18.5 ) is the same as that used in @xcite .",
    "they adopted this `` cut '' as a compromise between maximizing the number of objects in their final sample and assuring as much homogeneity ( equally luminous objects ) as possible through the range of redshifts they explored , which is the same as ours . in fig .",
    "[ figcomplete ] ( left ) we see that at redshift @xmath0@xmath40.7 , which is the mean / median redshift of our sample , the completeness level is at @xmath36@xmath4 -19.5 mag , a magnitude below the selected level .",
    "this makes our sample incomplete at fainter magnitudes beyond @xmath0@xmath40.5 .",
    "nevertheless , we decided to maintain our absolute magnitude selection criterion to satisfy the following objectives : a ) to allow a detailed comparison with tp05 , and b ) because otherwise our sample at low redshift would be significantly reduced .",
    "it is also interesting to note from the same figure that our sample lacks some high luminosity objects at lower redshifts because the surveyed volume is significantly smaller in that range . in the right panel of the same figure we see the completeness level in stellar",

    "the incompleteness with stellar mass is less severe than with luminosity .",
    "this is because the @xmath45/l relation evolves with redshift in this range , in the sense that for a same @xmath45galaxies at @xmath0@xmath41 are brighter in the @xmath2-band than at @xmath0@xmath40 ( eg .",
    "* ) .      to check the accuracy of our structural parameter determination and galaxy type classification , we made comparisons with deeper observations and with simulations .",

    "nearly 20% of type ii galaxies that are potentially missed in our work are not found because their break positions lie at fainter magnitudes than 25 - 26 mag/@xmath5 .",
    "we have divided our sample in 3 redshift bins or ranges ; `` low '' : 0.1@xmath650.5 , `` mid '' : 0.5@xmath650.8 and `` high '' : 0.8@xmath651.1 .",
    "of the 435 objects which were suitable for analysis , 146 ( 34% ) are classified as type i , 242 ( 56% ) as type ii and 47 ( 11% ) as type iii .",
    "all considered objects are visually confirmed as non irregular / merger , as we stated before .",
    "there are 6 objects , of types i and iii , which are suspected of being of early - type ( probably s0 , though it is difficult to be sure without more information ) , but have entered our statistics .",
    "these objects are marked as `` early '' in table [ tblresults ] , and the reason to include them is that they seem to have a genuine disk .",
    "nonetheless , and to avoid any controversy on this issue , our results on disk sizes are based on a subsample of the type ii objects , of which none is classified as `` early '' .",
    "our work is focused on the population of late - type , non interacting galaxies , in which the profile is `` externally '' truncated .",
    "this means we concentrate on type ii objects , and specifically on those in which the `` downbending '' break takes place in the outer parts of the visible disk , i.e. beyond the visible bars or spiral arms .",
    "a selection criterion for the ratio @xmath9/ @xmath13 , where @xmath13 is the scale length of the inner part of the disk , is not effective in discriminating between the two kinds of `` breaks '' : the `` inner '' , which take place `` inside '' the stellar disk , and the proper `` truncations '' , those which mark the edge of the stellar disk , or a decline in the density of the stellar population , and so the trained judgement of the classifier is needed to distinguish between them .",
    "we define , then , our `` truncated '' sample ( t - sample hereafter ) as follows : late - type objects , though not irregular , nor involved in merger events , with a type ii - truncated profile .",
    "this sample contains 238 objects .",
    "that means only 4 out of 242 objects which form the whole type ii sample have breaks of the `` inner '' kind .",
    "additionally , 48 of the objects in the t - sample have asymmetries in their disks ( 20% ) . finally , there are a few objects ( 15 , 6.3% ) in which the profile is of the mixed kind ii+iii . in these",
    "there is a clear type ii break , followed by a second break , of type iii ; even so we have included them in the t - sample .    the distribution of the objects amongst the 3 redshift ranges ,",
    "is given in table [ tblclass ] .",
    "we find that the frequency of objects classifed as of type i decreases from 39% to 25% between z@xmath41 and z@xmath40.3 . for type",
    "ii objects the opposite trend is found , increasing their proportion by almost 9% in the same period .",
    "these results are compatible with no changes in the distributions within the error bars .",
    "finally , type iii objects show no change in their relative population within the error bars between z@xmath41 and z@xmath40.3 .",
    "it is tempting to explore whether there is a real evolution in the populations of objects of different profile types .",
    "this would mean that more disk galaxies presented no truncations in the past than nowadays , relative to the fraction of those that present truncation .",
    "but first we need to look again fig .",
    "[ figsim_mag ] ( left ) , in which we show results from the simulations . as we stated above , when type i objects are fainter , they are increasingly mistaken for types ii or iii in roughly equal proportions . on the other hand ,",
    "genuine type ii objects are increasingly classified as type i when the magnitude decreases .",
    "consequently , it is quite possible that the observed variation in the frequencies is caused by misidentifications of type ii galaxies as type i at high @xmath0 .",
    "we also compare the given ratios of profile types with results published in pt06 for local disk galaxies in the sdss ( their sample being composed of 85 objects , with hubble types @xmath66 in the range 3@xmath1t@xmath18.5 ) . in the table 4 of that paper",
    "they report the following shares : 11@xmath33% of objects are classified as type i , 66@xmath35% objects have a type ii profile and 33@xmath35% have a type iii profile .",
    "the shares do not add up to 100 , and that is because they count objects with a mixed classification ( i.e. ii+iii or iii+ii ) for the statistics of both types . in our lowest redshift bin ( z@xmath40.3 )",
    "the objects are classified as 25@xmath36% of type i , 59@xmath39% of type ii and 15@xmath35% of type iii .",
    "we see the fraction of type ii objects is in good agreement with their results , while there is significant disagreement with regard to types i and iii .",
    "we assume that the fact that type iii is under represented in our work , in comparison with theirs , is probably because type iii objects have their breaks at lower brightness levels than type ii s , and so are harder to identify at intermediate redshifts .",
    "as stated in section 2 , the classification and characterization of the profiles has been performed in the band which best approximates the rest - frame @xmath2-band in each redshift bin . as a consequence ,",
    "the contribution of luminous young stars to the retrieved surface brightness profiles is significant .",
    "in fact , in many objects the signature of star forming `` clumps '' spread over the disks is evident in the images .",
    "this means that the reported `` truncations '' should be more accurately interpreted as related to , or at least influenced by , the extent of the `` star formation '' disk , a term we will use to refer to that part of the disk where most of the massive star formation is taking place in the galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the `` truncations '' found at longer wavelengths in other works ( e.g. pt06 ) could be more unambiguously interpreted as an abrupt decrease in the density of stellar mass . nonetheless , when comparing profile parameters of objects in the local universe ( from results in pt06 ) and at intermediate redshift from this work , we do so based on profile characterizations performed in similar rest - frame bands : @xmath67 for local objects and @xmath2-band for the higher redshift ones .      using the radial position of the truncation as a direct estimator of the size of the `` star formation dominated disk '' , we have explored the relation between @xmath9and the @xmath2-band luminosity of the galaxies for the t - sample ( `` truncated '' profiles ) . in fig .",

    "the objects are concentrated around ( -20.0 , -18.5 ) mag , while in the `` mid '' range the distribution is quite homogeneous between -18.5 @xmath28 @xmath36@xmath28 -22 mag .",
    "quite opposite to what happens at lower redshifts , in the `` high '' redshift bin the objects cluster around ( -20.0 , -21.5 ) mag .",
    "these distributions are the result of a ) probing a smaller volume in the lowest redshift bin and b ) the sample is incomplete at the lower end of luminosities in the higher redshift bin . to avoid as much as possible the sampling effects just described ,",
    "we explore the size evolution using as reference point @xmath36= -20 mag , which is well populated of galaxies at all redshifts .    in fig .",
    "[ figtrmag ] b ) we show the value of the aforementioned best fit lines at @xmath36= -20 mag , relative to the corresponding value in the @xmath0=0 sample ( logarithmic y - axis ) , against the mean value of redshift in each bin .",
    "the errors shown are from the bootstrap method applied to the fitting of the relation .",
    "we see how the ratio decreases with redshift .",
    "given the fact the points are aligned we fit them with a straight line . on this line ,",
    "the @xmath9of galaxy with @xmath36= -20 mag has increased by a factor 2.6@xmath30.3 between @xmath0=1 and @xmath0=0 .",
    "we see how the point at @xmath0=0.3 fits somewhat worse to the straight line than the others .",
    "nonetheless , the deviation is 2.5@xmath37 .    as we explained above",
    ", the ranges of @xmath36covered by the objects are not the same amongst different redshift bins , because of a lack of completeness inherent to the available data .",
    "although our analysis method has been devised to minimize the negative consequences this fact could have on the produced results , it would be desirable to test , within the possibilities granted by the available data , whether this method is really effective for the stated purpose .",
    "in this line , we have also explored the relation between @xmath9and @xmath36when a same range of @xmath36is used to select the objects in all redshift bins .",
    "this range has been chosen as -19.5@xmath68 - 21 mag . when applying this restriction , the sample populations reduce to 15 , 22 , 75 and 41 objects in the z@xmath40 , and the `` low '' , `` mid '' and `` high '' redshift bins respectively . in comparison , the whole samples explored in fig . 7 ( and also in figs . 8 through 14 )",
    "are 39 , 39 , 133 and 66 objects in the same redshift bins , i.e. , significantly larger .",
    "the growth factor in @xmath9between z@xmath41 and z@xmath40 , deduced from the best fit lines to the relation @xmath9-@xmath36at @xmath36=-20 mag is , when restricting the range in @xmath36 , 2.0@xmath30.8 , which is smaller than the value given above , but in agreement within the error bar .",
    "this further supports the hypothesis that the reported change in @xmath9at a fixed @xmath36across redshift is not due to differences in the luminosities range of the sampled objects .",
    "it is not entirely straightforward to interpret the size evolution of galaxies from the @xmath9- @xmath36relation , studied above , for the following reason .",
    "the mass luminosity relation , specially for shorter wavelength bands such as the @xmath2-band , has varied significantly between @xmath0=0 and @xmath0@xmath41 @xcite .",
    "objects of the same mass were brighter in the @xmath2-band in the past as their stellar populations were younger on average .",
    "this has as consequence that even if there were no changes in the @xmath9of objects , their proved increase in @xmath2-band luminosity would make the relation vary such that objects of a same @xmath36would have smaller values of @xmath9 in the past .",
    "this is the trend reported in the preceding subsection .",
    "fortunately there is a way to overcome the consequences of this luminosity evolution in order to test for a `` real '' change in the sizes of stellar disks with time ( or more properly , the size of the `` star formation dominated '' disk , as we are relying on rest - frame @xmath2-band data ) .",
    "this is to survey the @xmath9- @xmath45relation .",
    "it is also known that the stellar mass content of galaxies has increased since z@xmath41 , but this change has been more moderate , in relative terms , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath6930% ; ) than that in luminosity .    following the preceding discussion ,",
    "we have tested the relation between size ( @xmath9 ) and stellar mass .",
    "this is the strategy adopted in @xcite and @xcite to test for evolution of the effective radius of massive galaxies ( @xmath45@xmath34 @xmath70 @xmath47 ) at high redshifts . in fig .",
    "[ figtrmass ] we show , in analogous fashion to fig .",
    "[ figtrmag ] left , the values of @xmath9for objects of the t - sample against the stellar mass @xmath45 , as reported in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0=0 data come again from @xcite ( their stellar masses were computed following the prescription of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the best fit line ( obtained by the same method as in the @xmath9- @xmath36relation ) also does show a trend to lower values with redshift .",
    "while in this case the differences in the distribution of stellar masses are not as large as in the case of the luminosities , we see how the slopes are slightly less `` stable '' than in that case , based on the assumption that they should follow less pronounced changes between redshift ranges . this may be because the distribution of masses is not as broad relative to the distribution of @xmath9as the distribution of @xmath36 s .",
    "moreover , the stellar mass is a quantity derived from the luminosities , and this leads to an increase in the dispersion .",
    "the factors that go into producing the dispersion in the two relations ( @xmath9- @xmath36and @xmath9- @xmath45 ) , are the following : a ) inaccurate redshifts ( @xmath29@xmath0/(1+@xmath0)@xmath40.02 ) , b ) inaccurate estimates of the @xmath9(@xmath71 @xmath69 25% ) , and c ) intrinsic dispersion in the relation .",
    "though the two first factors ( especially the second ) may play a role in explaining part of the dispersion , we do not rule out the third possibility ; i.e. it is not only possible , but almost to be expected , that objects of the same mass may have followed different evolutionary paths ( depending on initial conditions and environment , for example ) , which have shaped their structure in a different way , and so produce `` intrinsic '' dispersions in the @xmath9- @xmath36and @xmath9- @xmath45relations .    in fig .",
    "[ figtrmass ] right we present the fitted value of @xmath9at @xmath70 @xmath47relative to the @xmath0=0 value , against the mean value of redshift in each bin .",
    "the errors are again derived from the bootstrap method applied when fitting the @xmath9-@xmath45relation .",
    "we see a less strong evolution with redshift than for the @xmath9-@xmath36relation .",
    "it is also interesting to see how in this case the points are much better aligned than for that relation .    from the linear fit to the points in fig .",
    "[ figtrmass ] right we deduce an increase by a factor of 1.3@xmath30.1 in @xmath9for a given stellar mass between @xmath0=1 and @xmath0=0 , i.e. in the last @xmath48 gyr using the standard parameters in our cosmological model . for comparison , in the same range of redshifts , and using the assumption of a maximum evolution in luminosity for their galaxies , @xcite reported a more moderate growth in @xmath9by a factor of at least 1.25 , which is in good agreement with our result .",
    "another point worth noting is that individual galaxies also evolve in stellar mass .",
    "for this reason it is interesting to provide a rough number of how much @xmath9could grow for a given `` individual '' galaxy . in the range of ages probed here",
    "it is claimed in the literature that galaxies have increased their stellar masses by @xmath430% @xcite .",
    "this means , that a type ii object with @xmath45= @xmath70 @xmath47at z=1 , would have its @xmath9larger by @xmath6950% today , i.e. by somewhat more than if its mass were unchanged .",
    "we have also explored the relation between @xmath9and @xmath45when a same range of @xmath45is imposed to select the objects in all redshift bins , in analogous way to what we did in subsection 5.2.1 for the @xmath9-@xmath36relation , and for the same reasons . in this case , the chosen range of stellar masses is @xmath72 @xmath47 . in this case",
    "the populations reduced to 30 , 11 , 59 and 40 galaxies within the z@xmath40 , and `` low '' , `` mid '' and `` high '' redshift bins , respectively . as a result , and for these stellar mass - restricted samples , the growth factor in @xmath9between z@xmath41 and z@xmath40 is 1.4@xmath30.2 , a minor difference with the value obtained for the unrestricted samples .",
    "this difference between `` restricted '' and `` unrestricted '' values is lesser than that found for the @xmath9-@xmath36relation because the distributions of @xmath45are more similar between the redsfhift bins than the distributions in @xmath36 .",
    "finally , this test strengthens the significance of the result found for the growth in the @xmath9-@xmath45relation , as it persists when only objects within a same stellar mass range are taken into account through redshift .",

    "the difference in median values of @xmath12between z@xmath41 and z@xmath40 is -3.5@xmath30.3 , only slightly larger than for unrestricted samples .",

    "@xcite found a median / mean value of 1.8 for @xmath9/@xmath13at z@xmath41 ( over 6 objects ) , which is also shorter than the local value , but still larger than those we find .",
    "it is probable that the difference in the sizes of the samples is the cause of this difference . with regard to the difference between the values of @xmath9/@xmath13she obtained and those observed in the local universe , she attributed it mainly to two biases : 1 )",
    "the detection limit on surface brightness would have prevented her from identifying the breaks with larger value of @xmath9/@xmath13 ; and 2 ) the effects of dust .",
    "the first reason is evident , but the latter may need clarification .",
    "she assumes dust absorption was more important in late - type galaxies at intermediate redshifts , and specially in the inner parts of the galaxies .",
    "this would be perceived as the inner parts of disks having their profiles `` flattened '' , i.e. with larger @xmath13 .",
    "this is what would make the quotient @xmath9/@xmath13smaller at higher redshift , relative to the local universe . again in fig .",
    "[ figtrh1z ] , it is also interesting how the distributions of the ratio @xmath9/@xmath13are quite similar amongst the sub - samples between z@xmath40.3 and z@xmath41 .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath9/@xmath13evolution presented here is measured in relation to the observed ( uncorrected for dust ) @xmath9/@xmath13of the local galaxies ; consequently , if the dust opacity were not to change with redshift , the observed evolution presented here would reflect an intrinsic evolution in the profile morphology of the objects .",
    "however , it is likely that the opacity of the galaxies changes with redshift . at a fixed inclination , bulge - to - total flux ratio , and rest - frame wavelength , the degree of attenuation and the increase in the observed scale length due to dust can be parameterized by the change in the central face - on optical depth .",
    "the optical depth is a very uncertain quantity ( even in the nearby universe ) , and this makes a detailed evaluation of the effect of dust to go beyond the scope of this work .",
    "consequently , we have not made any attempt to correct our results for the effect of opacity .",
    "nevertheless , in order to provide a crude estimate of how a significant increase in opacity could affect our results , we have performed the following exercise : let us assume a mean inclination of 30 degrees and an increase in the total central face - on optical depth in the @xmath2-band from 4 ( present - day galaxies ) to 8 ( high - z galaxies ) .",
    "this change implies a transition from an intermediate to a moderately optically thick case . in this case , for a disk - like galaxy observed in the @xmath2-band rest - frame , the attenuation increases by 0.25 mag ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , their fig . 3 and table 4 ) and the scale length increases by 12% @xcite .",
    "if we account for these numbers , the galaxies in our high - z sample would be intrinsically brighter by 25% and their scale length intrinsically smaller by 12% . in this sense , if we assume that the break position is not affected by the dust content , the observed ( uncorrected for dust increase ) @xmath9/@xmath13evolution presented in this paper would be an upper limit to the actual evolution .",
    "it is important to stress however , that a @xmath415% bias in @xmath9/@xmath13due to dust is far from explaining the amount of evolution observed here ( @xmath9/@xmath13increasing by a @xmath450% between z@xmath41 and z@xmath40 , as shown in fig .",
    "10 and table 3 ) .",
    "finally , there is no clear evidence that the mean optical depth in dust was in fact so much higher in previous epochs , and if the opacity were smaller in the past , then the situation would be reversed , with our current estimate of the size evolution being a lower limit .",
    "it could be argued that the low values of @xmath9/@xmath13found at intermediate redshifts could be related to the presence of stellar bars , as objects which present them tend to have lower values of this ratio .",
    "in fact , in pohlen & trujillo ( 2006 ) it was reported that in galaxies with bars ( type ii.o - olr ) @xmath9/@xmath13is , as measured in @xmath6-band , around 1.7 compared to 2.5 in galaxies without bars type ii - ct . however , using the largest up - to - date sample of face - on galaxies ( 0.2@xmath1z@xmath10.84 ) from the cosmos 2-square degree field , @xcite find that the fraction of barred spiral galaxies declines with redshift . for galaxies with @xmath45@xmath34@xmath70@xmath47the fraction of bars drops from 65% in the local universe to 20% at z@xmath484 .",
    "it must also be taken into account that the type ii.o - olr objects are included in our `` local '' sample , as , due to insufficient angular resolution , it is not possible to discriminate with the same accuracy in the higher redshift samples , as it is possible to attain with the local objects , whether the `` truncations '' are of this type ( ii.o - olr ) or not .",
    "these facts together imply that the systematical decline in the @xmath9/@xmath13ratio we see with redshift is unlikely to be due to a bar fraction increase .",
    "another point which is interesting to discuss with regard to this problem is related to the apparent similarity of many of the high - z galaxies under study in this work with the irregular galaxies in the local universe . moreover ,",
    "the values of @xmath9/@xmath13and @xmath13are similar to those derived in @xcite for a sample of irregular galaxies .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the present - day irregular galaxies could be the final stage of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "our high - z galaxies are much more massive than these local irregular galaxies .",
    "an interesting feature , however , shared by these two families of galaxies is a large value of their specific star formation rate ssfr ( see for example the comparison between the ssfr fo @xmath75@xmath47galaxies at low redshift and the @xmath70 @xmath47galaxies at z@xmath40.85 in fig . 2 of * ?",
    "* ) and the fact that their star formation is well spread over the galaxy disk .",
    "this is probably the main reason for their large inner scale - length . with the purpose of shedding some light on this puzzling phenomenon ,",

    "again , we have divided the objects in 3 redshift bins , and the local data are from pt06 ( @xmath67-band results ) . in the low redshift bin ( 0.1@xmath760.5 )",
    "our derived relation depends less on luminosity than that reported by pt06 . in the `` mid '' redshift bin ,",
    "though , both relations show as parallel . in the `` high ''",
    "range the relation reverses , in the sense that @xmath9/@xmath13decreases slightly with the @xmath2-band luminosity of the galaxies , in contrast to the sense in the local universe .",
    "this feature has not been previously reported and we must try to explain it .",
    "first , in the `` high '' redshift bin there is a lack of low luminosity galaxies which might make the slope of the best fit line tilt downwards .",
    "but , if this were a real phenomenon ( and we will give more evidence below supporting this ) , and not an observational effect , what would it mean ? assuming an exponential profile , the ratio @xmath9/ @xmath13is proportional to the difference between the surface brightness of the inner exponential measured at the break and at the center : @xmath9/@xmath13@xmath73 ( @xmath12- @xmath11(r=0 ) ) .",
    "so what we see is that , at z@xmath41 the more luminous objects had a profile which changed less in surface brightness , in absolute terms , from center to the break , than the less luminous objects ( i.e. the surface brightness profile is flatter for the more luminous galaxies ) .",
    "flat profiles , in these rest - frame wavelengths , imply that the star formation was taking place more homogeneously across the whole galaxy disk ( a good example is udf3372 shown in fig .",
    "[ figu2 g ] ) .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figtrh1mag ] we can see the ratio @xmath9/@xmath13relative to the local value ( pt06 ) , at @xmath36=-20 mag , for every redshift bin , taken from the linear fits given in the left panel . we see how there is little evolution in the ratio from @xmath0@xmath40.3 to z@xmath41 .",
    "the ratio @xmath9/@xmath13varies between 0.62@xmath30.04 and 0.66@xmath30.11 of the local value at these redshifts , although the error bars are large to derive any firm conclusion .",
    "the points in the panel give the impression that there is a `` gap '' between the values at z@xmath40 and those at intermediate redshifts , perhaps raising concerns about some kind of difference between samples , other than genuine evolutionary changes in this structural parameter , or variations in the methods employed to study the samples .",
    "we must say first that , if we take into account the error bars , the significance of this `` gap '' is significantly reduced . we also want to stress that the analysis methodology employed here is analogous to that used in studying the local objects . but we will come over this point below , where the relation @xmath9-@xmath45is broached .",
    "we have also tested how the @xmath9/@xmath13for the t - sample relates to the stellar mass of the galaxies , and this we can see in fig .",
    "[ figtrh1mass ] . in the left panel ,",
    "we see the given ratio against the stellar mass for the different redshift bins ( local data are from pt06 , as obtained in the @xmath67-band ) .",
    "both panels are analogous to those in fig .",
    "[ figtrh1mag ] , but substituting @xmath36for @xmath45 . in this case",
    ", the relation between @xmath9/@xmath13and @xmath45 in the `` low '' redshift bin is steeper than the relation reported by pt06 at @xmath0@xmath40 .",
    "note that the local sample covers a smaller range in stellar mass , which could somehow bias the local @xmath9/@xmath13determination . in the mid redshift bin ,",
    "the two relations are almost parallel , and in the high redshift range , the slope changes from positive to negative , as happened in the @xmath9/@xmath13vs .",
    "@xmath36 in the same range of redshifts .",
    "it is important to note that the dispersions are quite large , and so these slopes must be taken with caution .",
    "but it is interesting to note again an anticorrelation between @xmath9/@xmath13and @xmath45at @xmath0@xmath41 . as we said above for the more luminous objects",
    ", it seems that more massive galaxies at high redshift have an inner disk whose surface brightness decreases less between the central part and the break , compared to the less massive ones .    in the right panel of the figure [ figtrh1mass ]",
    "we show the values of the best fits to the distributions of @xmath9/@xmath13at @xmath45= @xmath70 @xmath47 , against redshift .",
    "this time the decrease in @xmath9/@xmath13is progressive , and we find that the ratio has increased by a factor 1.6@xmath30.3 between @xmath0@xmath41 and @xmath0=0 , from the linear fit .",
    "a point of particular interest is that the points in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figtrh1mass ] appear better aligned than in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figtrh1mag ] .",
    "this could mean that the apparent discontinuity in the @xmath9-@xmath36relation commented above may be , at least in part , caused by the significant evolution in @xmath2-band luminosity in the same redshift range .",
    "but we would not like to push this interpretation , as the error bars are large enough to be compatible with a more progressive evolution of @xmath9/@xmath13at a given @xmath36with redshift .",
    "also for the @xmath9/@xmath13parameter have we tested its relations with @xmath36and @xmath45when the corresponding ranges to select the objects are fixed , as in previous subsections . in the case for a fixed @xmath36(selection range : -19.5@xmath68 - 21 mag ) , the ratio @xmath9/@xmath13at intermediate redshifts varies between 0.50@xmath30.08 and 0.59@xmath30.17 of the local value .",
    "this is a slightly larger difference with local values than for the unrestricted samples .",
    "this does not affect in a perceptible way our discussion on this parameter .",
    "for the relation between @xmath9/@xmath13and @xmath45(selection range : @xmath72 @xmath47 ) , the result remains just unchanged with respect to the unrestricted case .",
    "this is , there is an increase in the ratio also by a factor 1.5@xmath30.3 between @xmath0@xmath41 and @xmath0=0 , from the linear fit .      in a further attempt towards clarifying why we find a distribution of @xmath9/@xmath13with lower mean and median values at higher redshift",
    "than in the local universe , we have also probed the relation between @xmath13and @xmath36and @xmath45for the `` truncated '' galaxies under study .    in fig .",
    "[ figh1mag ] we present @xmath13as a function of @xmath36for galaxies of the t - sample , again for different redshift bins , as in previous similar figures ( [ figtrmag ] and [ figtrh1mag ] ) . in the left panel",
    "we have also included the relation between `` size '' ( i.e. scale length derived from the effective radius as explained below ) and absolute magnitude found by @xcite for local , srsic @xmath772.5 galaxies in the sdss , represented by their best fit curve ( slash - dotted line ) .",
    "@xcite published the relation between the srsic effective radius of the galaxies ( i.e. the radius that encloses half of the light of the srsic model that best fits to the distribution of light of the object ) , as measured in @xmath6 band and absolute magnitude ( see fig . 6 in their paper ) .",
    "our profiles are retrieved in approximately rest - frame @xmath2-band ( @xmath4 @xmath67 band ) , but we would not expect dramatic differences in the size estimates of disks between the two bands ( either from scale lengths or truncation radii ; see eg .",
    "values of these parameters in both bands in table in pt06 ) . assuming an @xmath32=1 srsic profile ( exponential profile ) , we converted the effective radii ( @xmath78 ) to scale length of the exponential profile using the expression @xmath79 = @xmath78 / 1.676 .",
    "as their cut - off for classification as a late - type galaxy was as broad as @xmath772.5 ( the same as ours ) , this implies that most of their objects do not obey the exponential law , and we should term this @xmath79 as the equivalent scale length .",
    "we still show their curve for reference .",
    "first , we see how the values of @xmath13 in the pt06 sample fall above the @xcite curve ( @xmath13values from pt06 were obtained in the @xmath67-band ) .",
    "this result is expected since fitting the whole profile of a truncated galaxy will produce smaller values of scale length than for the inner part .",
    "our results are divided amongst the other 3 sub - panels as a function of redshift , and we see how the best fit lines to the distributions have much steeper slopes than for the local sample . our galaxies cover a wider range in @xmath13relative to local ones , reaching larger limits , especially for the most luminous objects .",
    "we see in the right panel the @xmath13values from the best fits to the distributions at @xmath36=-20 mag , as a function of redshift .",
    "it can be seen how there is a moderate decrease in @xmath13with redshift . in fig .",
    "[ figh1mass ] ( left ) we show the relation between @xmath13and the stellar mass for the galaxies of the t - sample , at different redshifts .",
    "the local data , as before , are from pt06 ( results obtained in @xmath67-band ) .",
    "the slash - dotted line represents the relation between equivalent scale length , @xmath79 = @xmath78 / 1.676 , and stellar mass given in @xcite ( taken from their fig .",
    "10 ) . that is a best fit to the relation they find for late - type ( @xmath772.5 ) galaxies in sdss , in the @xmath80 band .",
    "again , we would not expect dramatic changes in size parameters of disks between @xmath2 and @xmath80 band , and this is the best suited result for comparison they give .",
    "it is evident that as in the @xmath13- @xmath36relation , the values of @xmath13fall systematically above the @xcite relation .",
    "the reason for this is the same as the given previously : the inner scale lengths in `` truncated '' galaxies are systematically larger than the scale - length of the whole disk .",
    "we can see how our distributions of @xmath13are slightly above ( reaching higher values ) those for the local sample , and their best fit lines have steeper slopes than in the lowest redshift range . in the right panel of the same figure",
    "we see the best fit value to the @xmath13distributions at @xmath45= @xmath70@xmath47 , relative to the local value , against redshift .",
    "the values of @xmath13at intermediate redshifts are larger than the local ones by a factor that goes from 1.29@xmath30.12 to 1.20@xmath30.11 between @xmath810.3 and @xmath810.9 .",
    "this overall slight increase in @xmath13 , combined with the decrease of @xmath9are responsible for the reported decrease in @xmath9/@xmath13at higher redshift .",
    "the decrease by a factor 1.3 in @xmath9(at a fixed stellar mass ) , times the increase in @xmath13by @xmath41.25 ( also at a given stellar mass ) gives 1.6 , in agreement with the reported decrease between @xmath810 and @xmath811 . from the lack of evolution of @xmath13at intermediate redshifts seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "14 , and the previous discussions on the @xmath9- @xmath45and @xmath9/@xmath13relations , we can also say something else .",
    "the disks have become fainter ( in rest - frame @xmath2-band ) , while keeping their slopes ( @xmath731/@xmath13 ) roughly constant or slightly increasing , and at the same time increasing their @xmath9 , as the universe has grown older ( in the surveyed range of redshifts ) .",
    "we have also probed these relations under restrictions in the selected @xmath36(-19.5@xmath68 - 21 mag ) and @xmath45(@xmath72 @xmath47 ) , depending on whether @xmath13is related to luminosity or stellar mass respectively .",
    "on one hand , for the @xmath13- @xmath36relation , this varies by a factor 1.02@xmath30.2 between z@xmath41 and z@xmath40 ; i.e. no evolution in the surveyed range of redshifts is retrieved ( in the `` unrestricted '' case this factor is 1.4@xmath30.5 ) . on the other hand , for the @xmath13- @xmath45relation",
    ", the result is the same as in the case when no restrictions in @xmath45are applied .",
    "this is , from the linear fit we obtain a decrease in @xmath13by a factor 0.8@xmath30.1 between z@xmath41 and z@xmath40 when the mass is fixed .",
    "again we see how using the same ranges of luminosities and stellar masses in every redshift bin does not vary significantly the results .",
    "the previous sub - sections have shown that both the break position @xmath9and the surface brightness at the break radius @xmath12have evolved with cosmic time .",
    "it could be argued , however , that part of this evolution could be due to selection effects , since as shown in section 4 very faint breaks can be missed if they were present in the galaxies analysed .",
    "we have checked whether this is the case by exploring how our surface brightness limit could affect the observed evolution .    according to sec .",
    "4 , the profiles are reliable down to @xmath11@xmath426 mag/@xmath5 .",
    "being conservative , we estimate that we should be able to identify breaks with high confidence down to @xmath12@xmath82@xmath425.5 mag/@xmath5 . using this number as the limiting value we could estimate what would be the rest - frame ( i.e. cosmological dimming corrected ) surface brightness at the break at which the number of objects classified as of type ii will start to decline due to a selection effect and not as a result of a real evolution .",
    "these numbers will be 24.4 mag/@xmath5(@xmath810.3 ) , 23.3 mag/@xmath5(@xmath810.65 ) and 22.6 mag/@xmath5(@xmath810.95 ) .",
    "as we can see in fig .",
    "[ figmuz ] , these numbers are far away ( more than a magnitude in all cases ) from the position of the peak in the observed galaxy surface brightness break distribution .",
    "this reinforces the idea that most of the observed evolution is real and not caused by this effect .",
    "another test we have run is to estimate what would be the maximum @xmath9that could be measured at a given absolute magnitude according to the limiting surface brightness proposed above . at the highest redshift bin , @xmath811 , the `` distance modulus '' is 43 mag ( @xmath83 correction included , derived from the direct comparison of @xmath27magnitudes to @xmath36 ) .",
    "again , we use a surface brightness limit of 25.5 mag/@xmath5 .",
    "we consider a truncated exponential galaxy with a typical scale length of @xmath79 = 0.5 arcsecs .",
    "with these values , the largest @xmath9that could be measured would be : @xmath9= 11.1 kpc for galaxies with @xmath36=-20 mag and @xmath9=18.5 kpc for galaxies with @xmath36= -22 mag . as can be seen these values",
    "are again far away from the observational data distribution , indicating that most ( if not all ) of the observed evolution is real and not caused by our limiting detected surface brightness .",
    "in this work we have presented an analysis of surface brightness profiles for a sample of 505 galaxies in the goods - south field , making use of hst - acs imaging from @xcite .",
    "these galaxies are all classified as disk galaxies , based on the selection of those objects with srsic indexes @xmath772.5 ( srsic profile fitting is from * ? ? ?",
    "we have also used publicly available data on redshift estimates , absolute rest - frame @xmath2-band magnitudes and stellar masses from @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we have classified the profiles using the presence of `` breaks '' in the exponential profiles of the disks , and the ratio of inner and outer scale lengths ( @xmath13/@xmath44 ) in types i ( no apparent break ) , ii ( `` downbending break '' ; @xmath13/@xmath44@xmath84 ) and iii ( `` upbending break '' ; @xmath13/@xmath44@xmath11 ) .",
    "this characterization has been performed in bands which , within the explored range of redshifts , track the rest - frame @xmath2-band .",
    "we have performed simulations on the classification and profile characterization of artificial galaxies , analogous to that performed on real galaxies . with regard to their classification ,",
    "the worst results are for type i objects , 50 % of which we fail to classify correctly at the faintest magnitudes ( @xmath27@xmath3422.5 mag ab ) , while for types ii and iii the success rates are much higher ( @xmath5170 - 80% ) .",
    "we have also compared our results on classification and @xmath9estimate to those presented in @xcite for a set of 32 galaxies in common to our sample and theirs .",
    "their results are based on the _",
    "hst_-udf observations , which are deeper than the goods images . both sets of classifications match in @xmath470% of cases .",
    "particularly , in the case of type ii galaxies there were only 2 cases out of 19 ( @xmath410% ) that were classified differently in our work due to insufficient depth in the images .",
    "when we compare the @xmath9and @xmath12estimated in the two studies for type ii objects in common , we find no clear bias in any sense .",
    "the dispersions are @xmath57=22% and @xmath85 = 43% , which can be used as estimates of the errors in these structural parameters .    in this work",
    "we put special emphasis on the study of `` truncated '' galaxies , i.e. those with type ii profile , with the `` break '' taking place in the outer part of the disk .",
    "this subsample , which we call the t - sample , is composed of 238 objects , an order of magnitude larger than any sample in previously published work at intermediate redshifts .",
    "we have studied the relation between the radius at which the `` break '' takes place , @xmath9 , and absolute @xmath2-band magnitude and total stellar mass for these objects .",
    "we find a clear evolution in @xmath9with redshift , galaxies with the same values of luminosity / stellar mass having shorter @xmath9 s than local galaxies ( using as reference the results in * ? ? ?",
    "we measure an increase by a factor 1.3@xmath30.1 in @xmath9between @xmath811 and @xmath810 at fixed @xmath45= @xmath70 @xmath47 , and by a factor 2.6@xmath30.3 at fixed @xmath36= -20 mag , in the same range of redshifts .    at the same time",
    ", there is also clear evidence for a decrease in the surface brightness level @xmath12at which the `` break '' takes place on the profile in the last @xmath48gyr .",
    "we find that @xmath12(in the rest - frame @xmath2-band ) has decreased by 3.3@xmath30.2 mag between @xmath811 and nowadays .",
    "this is equivalent to a decrease in surface intensity by a factor 20.9@xmath34.2 .",
    "another point of interest is how @xmath9relates to the scale length @xmath13of the disk inside the `` break '' .",
    "we show results on the ratio @xmath9/@xmath13at different redshift ranges up to z@xmath41 .",
    "the median values of this ratio are significantly smaller than those found in the local universe ( 1.4@xmath30.6 at @xmath811 versus 2.0@xmath30.7 at @xmath810 ) . we also find that in the highest redshift bin ( 0.8@xmath651.1 ) @xmath9/@xmath13tends to decrease moderately with @xmath36and @xmath45 , in contrast to what happens in the local universe and the other redshift bins .",
    "this means that , at the epoch corresponding to @xmath811 , more massive objects had somewhat smaller difference in brightness between the central part of the disk and the break radius , than less luminous / massive objects ( implying that their surface brightness profiles are flatter ) .",
    "finally , we have also probed the relation between @xmath13and @xmath2-band luminosity and stellar mass .",
    "we see how the distribution of values of @xmath13is broader , reaching higher values , at intermediate redshifts than in the local universe .",
    "the mean values of @xmath13seem to be somewhat larger than local ones , by a factor 1.3 at most , but there is almost no evolution in them ( within our statistics ) between @xmath810.3 and @xmath811 .    we have also tested the previous relations when the samples are selected within the same ranges of @xmath36and / or @xmath45 in every redshift bin . the reported figures do not change significantly under these restrictions , and this further supports the robustness of the results .",
    "we conclude by remarking that our results are consistent with the following picture of disk evolution .",
    "we find that in the lapse of time that goes from @xmath811 to the present epoch ( @xmath48 gyr ) , the radii of the `` break '' in truncated disks , as measured in @xmath4@xmath2-band , have increased noticeably , while the intensities ( on the profile ) at which the break takes place have substantially decreased .",
    "we interpret the @xmath9 , in this particular case , as a measure of the size of the disk where most of the massive star formation is taking place , as the @xmath2-band is more influenced by the emission from these young stars than redder bands . at a given stellar mass , the scale lengths of the disk in the part inner to the `` break '' were on average somewhat larger in the past , and have remained more or less constant until recently . this phenomenon could be related to the spatial distribution of star formation , which seems to be rather spread over the disks in the images .",
    "so disk galaxies had profiles with a flatter brightness distribution in the inner part of the disk , which has grown in extension , while becoming fainter and `` steeper '' over time .",
    "this is consistent with at least some versions of the inside - out formation scenario for disks .",

    "the galfit software allows the user to build a model as the sum of a series of analytic 2d components . for each component",
    "the user can choose the 2d geometry of the isophotes , as a generalized ellipse ( i.e. with `` regular '' appearance , but which can also adopt a `` disky '' or `` boxy '' appearance , depending on the `` c '' parameter ) , and besides , also the law that governs the radial profile of intensity .",

    "<S> we have conducted the largest systematic search so far for stellar disk truncations in disk - like galaxies at intermediate redshift ( @xmath0@xmath11.1 ) , using the great observatories origins deep survey south ( goods - s ) data from the _ hubble space telescope _ - acs . focusing on type ii galaxies ( i.e. downbending profiles ) we explore whether the position of the break in the rest - frame @xmath2-band radial surface brightness profile ( a direct estimator of the extent of the disk where most of the massive star formation is taking place ) , evolves with time . </S>",
    "<S> the number of galaxies under analysis ( 238 of a total of 505 ) is an order of magnitude larger than in previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> for the first time , we probe the evolution of the break radius for a given stellar mass ( a parameter well suited to address evolutionary studies ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that , for a given stellar mass , the radial position of the break has increased with cosmic time by a factor 1.3@xmath30.1 between @xmath0@xmath41 and @xmath0@xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with a moderate inside - out growth of the disk galaxies in the last @xmath4 8 gyr . in the same period of time , the surface brightness level in the rest - frame @xmath2-band at which the break takes place has increased by 3.3@xmath30.2 mag/@xmath5(a decrease in brightness by a factor of 20.9@xmath34.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have explored the distribution of the scale lengths of the disks in the region inside the break , and how this parameter relates to the break radius . </S>",
    "<S> we also present results of the statistical analysis of profiles of artificial galaxies , to assess the reliability of our results . </S>"
