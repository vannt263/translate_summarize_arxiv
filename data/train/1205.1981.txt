    "in complex thin - film transition - metal oxide heterostructures , interface phenomena can substantially affect the electronic properties and lead new electronic ordered states not observed in the bulk constituents @xcite .",
    "prominent examples are the titanate interfaces in the heterostructures laalo@xmath2/srtio@xmath2 , latio@xmath2/srtio@xmath2 and similar compounds @xcite . these structures have recently attracted much attention which is focused on the discovered two - dimensional electron liquid state stabilized by the interface electronic reconstruction .",
    "the magnetoresistance and torque magnetometry measurements @xcite demonstrate a hysteretic behavior in the field - dependences of magnetoresistance and superparamagnetic behavior which suggests the existence of ferromagnetic puddles in the samples of laalo@xmath2 ( lao ) grown on srtio@xmath2 ( sto ) .",
    "the observation of the magnetism at the lao / sto interface triggered an intense exploration of the role of impurities in the formation of the magnetically ordered state at these interfaces @xcite .",
    "in particular , recent first - principle studies demonstrate a vacancy - related magnetic exchange splitting of @xmath3 states of interface ti atoms  @xcite . in this case , the conducting electrons , which emerge due to the charge compensation of the polar discontinuity occupy @xmath4 bands , whereas the vacancy - released electrons occupy @xmath5 states shifted below the fermi level due to the interface orbital reconstruction  @xcite .",
    "stm , cathode luminescence studies and conductivity measurements provide strong support for the existence of the oxygen vacancies in sto layers of lao / sto heterostructures @xcite .",
    "as the dft calculations are unable to access a realistic random low - concentration distribution of impurities , we consider here an effective two - dimensional one - band hubbard model on a square lattice with disordered random vacancies . in this model",
    ", each vacancy introduces an exchange splitting of the local @xmath6 state of neighbouring ti atoms , in this way stabilizing a ferromagnetic order through the electronic transfer term .",
    "the two - dimensional electronic liquid at the titanate interfaces is described by an effective one - band hubbard model on a lattice with @xmath7 sites which corresponds to the interface tio@xmath8 layer .",
    "each site @xmath9 identifies a doubled @xmath10 tio@xmath8 unit cell with two ti atoms @xmath11 and four nearest neighbouring oxygen atoms @xmath12 ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) , where the cell doubling is introduced for the studies of magnetically ordered states on two ti sublattices . in this configuration",
    ", the oxygen vacancy corresponds to the elimination of one of the oxygens in the ti@xmath8o@xmath13-plaquette .",
    "the local disorder induced by an oxygen vacancy on the lattice site ( @xmath14 ) is introduced through the local random fields @xmath15 , which shift the electronic @xmath6 states of the neighbouring ti atoms : @xmath16 here @xmath17 are electron creation operators and @xmath18 are the occupation numbers for the self - doped @xmath6 electrons with the local energy @xmath19 and chemical potential @xmath20 ; @xmath21 is the local hubbard repulsion and @xmath22 is the effective indirect @xmath23 electronic transfer energy .",
    "the binary discrete random variable @xmath24 is zero if the oxygen atom is absent in the oxygen position ( @xmath9,@xmath25 ) of the unit cell @xmath9 .",

    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are the heisenberg representations of the operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 . to calculate the average electronic orbital occupancies for the hamiltonian with the random configurational variables @xmath35",
    ", we employ the coherent potential approximation @xcite which allows to express the configurationally averaged green functions @xmath36 through the effective medium green functions @xmath37 : @xmath38 where the @xmath39 matrix @xmath40 describes the local scattering on the defect potential . in the @xmath41-space ,",
    "the effective medium sublattice green functions have the following form :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the effective self - energies @xmath48 should be determined from the equality of the effective - medium propagators and the corresponding configurationally averaged green functions @xmath49 which is equivalent to the condition @xmath50 in the single - site approximation , and in our case leads to the following equations for the determination of @xmath48 : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the random deviations from the effective medium self energies due to the local disorder .",
    "the local green functions @xmath54 are determined from the bare green functions for the stoichiometric lattice : @xmath55 which are calculated after the mean - field decoupling of the local hubbard term in @xmath26 .",
    "we note that the mean - field approach allows to capture the main features of the ordered states in the correlated systems and is widely used to study orbital physics at correlated interfaces @xcite .    in the ferromagnetically ordered state ,",
    "we have @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and the problem is reduced to the solution of the equations ( [ t ] ) and the selfconsistent equations for the magnetization and chemical potential @xmath58 which should be considered for a given electron concentration @xmath59 .",
    "the thermodynamically averaged occupancies @xmath60 in this case are expressed through the effective - medium green functions @xmath61 and correspond to the configurationally averaged electronic occupation numbers .    in the limit of small concentrations of the oxygen vacancies",

    "the numerical solutions of the equations ( [ mn ] ) for different vacancy concentrations @xmath68 have been analyzed in the low - temperature range @xmath69 for the electronic concentration @xmath59 in the range between 0.1 and 0.4 which corresponds to the concentrations @xmath70",
    "@xmath71@xmath72  @xmath71 of the interface - doped polar charge in the tio@xmath8 layers measured in hall effect experiments @xcite and estimated from ab - initio calculations @xcite .",
    "= 8.0 cm    in the regime of weak and intermediate hubbard correlation energies @xmath73 , we obtained a monotonic increase of the local magnetization for higher vacancy concentrations @xmath68 , which can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "the value @xmath74 corresponds to the correlation energies of ti @xmath3 electrons used in ab - initio dft+u calculations in @xcite .",
    "[ fig2](a ) shows that a robust magnetic state with magnetic moments larger than @xmath75  @xmath76 can be achieved only for the high vacancy concentration @xmath77 , which corresponds to vacancy densities above a critical value @xmath70  @xmath71 .",
    "this range of vacancy densities was indeed analyzed in the ab - initio calculations which explains a good agreement of the results obtained in @xcite with the experimental measurements .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of the magnetic moments calculated in the range of strong hubbard correlations @xmath78 shows the existence of a transition from the weak - magnetization regime to the regime of strong magnetism , indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) . in the strong - correlation regime ,",
    "large values of the local magnetic moments of the order @xmath79",
    "@xmath76 are stabilized already for small @xmath68 , which can be explained by the intrinsic property of the hubbard model to stabilize the ferromagnetic state in the concentration range of approximately quarter - filling : the transition from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic state upon an increase of @xmath21 can be identified from the magnetic phase diagram for the two - dimensional hubbard model @xcite , where the concentration range @xmath80 corresponds to the electronic doping levels considered in this work .",
    "considering the large values of the magnetic moments , the situation at the cuprate interfaces corresponds rather to the strong - correlation regime .",
    "one can expect that the strong - correlation regime can be realized , for example , at oxygen - reduced cuprate interfaces , which would provide a possibility for a strong enhancement of the ferromagnetic state by oxygen vacancies , a scenario which may lead to the formation of ferromagmetic regions coexisting with a superconducting background .",
    "we considered magnetic states of correlated oxide interfaces , where effective charge self - doping and magnetically ordered states emerge due to the electronic and ionic reconstructions . employing the coherent potential approximation to the effective one - band hubbard model with disorder",
    ", we analyzed the effect of random oxygen vacancies on the formation of two - dimensional magnetism .",
    "we find that the random vacancies enhance the ferromagnetically ordered state and stabilize a robust magnetization above a critical vacancy concentration of about @xmath0 . in the strong - correlated regime",
    ", we also obtain a nonmomnotonic increase of the magnetization upon an increase of vacancy concentration and observe a substantial increase of the magnetic moments .",
    "this enhancement appears due to the intrinsic property of strong electron correlations to stabilize a ferromagnetic state at electron doping levels @xmath81 electrons per unit cell , typical for the polar - doped interfaces @xcite .",
    "although a mean - field evaluation might well overestimate the tendency towards a ferromagnetic state , the inhomogeneous ( disordered ) states considered here rather support ferromagnetic correlations : disorder reduces the kinetic energy and the impurities , being effectively magnetic , present a seed for at least short - range magnetism .",
