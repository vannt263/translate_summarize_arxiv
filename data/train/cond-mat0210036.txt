    ", these models exhibit complex behavior and are used to investigate fundamental problems in statistical mechanics , such as spin models @xcite and nonequilibrium phenomena @xcite . in particular , the problem of phase transitions in the presence of absorbing states has attracted increasing interest in recent years ; pca play a major role in these studies @xcite .",
    "the pca introduced by domany and kinzel @xcite is , along with the contact process @xcite , one of the simplest models exhibiting an absorbing - state phase transition .",
    "the one - dimensional domany - kinzel stochastic cellular automaton ( dkca ) is a completely discrete system - temporally , spatially and in its state space - which attracts interest as a particle system affording a test of ideas on scaling in nonequilibrium critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "the dkca has a unique absorbing (  vacuum \" ) state ; its phase diagram presents a critical line separating this absorbing phase from an active one .",
    "continuous phase transitions to an absorbing state are conjectured to belong generically to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class @xcite .",
    "in addition to the active - absorbing transition , martins _",
    "_ @xcite found a damage spreading ( ds ) transition separating the active phase into nonchaotic and chaotic phases .",
    "there is numerical evidence that the critical behavior along this transition line also belongs to the dp class , as expected on the basis of universality @xcite .",
    "recently , bagnoli _ et al _ @xcite introduced a model that can be considered a natural extension of the dkca : a one - dimensional pca in which the update of a given site depends on the state of its nearest neighbors and itself , at the preceding time step .",
    "( we shall refer to this model as the bpca . ) thus , compared with the dkca , there is an additional parameter , @xmath0 , representing the probability for a site to be active at time @xmath1 , given that all three sites were active at time @xmath2 .",
    "_ studied @xmath4 , in which case the model presents two absorbing states : the empty one and the completely occupied configuration . as in the dkca ,",
    "the density is the order parameter .",
    "these authors used the mean field approximation ( at site level ) , simulations , and field - theoretic arguments to study the model .",
    "they found a rich phase diagram , with first- and second - order phase transitions , a bicritical point , and a damage - spreading transition .",
    "except for the line @xmath7 in the dkca , this is the simplest pca that exhibits a discontinuous phase transition @xcite .    in this work",
    "we extend the analysis of the bpca considering two cases : the previously studied @xmath4 , which corresponds to a ferromagnetic - like model , and @xmath3 , representing a _ game - of - life_-like model @xcite .",
    "we extend the mean - field analysis to the pair level , and use simulations to construct the phase diagram . in simulations ,",
    "we apply the growth - exponent method @xcite to identify transitions .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section ii we define the model and its interface representation ; the site and pair mean - field approximations are discussed in section iii .",
    "simulation results are presented in section iv .",
    "we summarize our findings in section v.",
    "the one - dimensional pca with three - site neighborhood ( bpca ) was proposed by bagnoli _",
    "it consists of a ring of @xmath8 sites ( @xmath9 ) , with periodic boundaries , in which each site @xmath10 has two possible states , conveniently denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the state of the system at time @xmath1 is given by the set \\{@xmath12}. in contrast to the deterministic ca studied by wolfram @xcite , the present model is a discrete time markov process : the rules for updating the system are given by transition probabilities .",
    "in particular , state of site @xmath10 at time @xmath13 depends on @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , via the transition probability @xmath17 .",
    "the latter is of totalistic form , i.e. , the dependence is through @xmath18 . since @xmath19 implies @xmath20 with probability 1 ,",
    "there remain three free parameters for defining the transition probability . specifically : + @xmath21 + @xmath22 + @xmath23 + evidently , @xmath24 .    depending on the values of ( @xmath25 ) , the asymptotic ( @xmath26 ) state of the system",
    "is either in an absorbing phase ( _ phase 0 _ , with all sites in state 0 , or _ phase 1 _ , with all sites in state 1 ) , or in the active phase , in which the stationary density @xmath27 of sites in state 1 takes a value different from zero or one .",
    "complete determination of the phase diagram in the three - dimensional parameter space is a rather difficult open problem . in this work we focus on two cases : @xmath4 and @xmath3 . in the first case , the model possesses the two absorbing phases cited above , as well as an active phase and a chaotic region ( associated with damage spreading ) . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the phase 1 is no longer absorbing ( though the phase 0 of course remains so ) , and there is again an active phase ; the chaotic region is reentrant .",
    "@xmath3 describes a situation in which  crowding \" of individuals leads to their destruction , similar to conway s game of life model @xcite , while @xmath4 corresponds to a ferromagnetic - like model .",
    "the _ absorbing / active _ transitions are continuous phase transitions , characterized by critical exponents which belong to the dp universality class .",
    "phase 0/phase 1 _ transition is discontinuous @xcite , and the exponents are those of _ compact _ directed percolation .",
    "the ds transitions are also in the dp class , consistent with grassberger s prediction @xcite .",
    "the termination of two critical lines at a line of discontinuous transitions marks a _",
    "bicritical _ point , as has been found in the bpca for @xmath4 . for @xmath28 ,",
    "the phase 1 is no longer absorbing , so that one of the phase boundaries ( i.e. , between the active and phase 1-absorbing phases ) is no longer present .",
    "we find ( using the two - site mean - field approximation , discussed in sec .",
    "iiib ) , that the bicritical point is actually one terminus of a line of _ tricritical _ points : for each fixed @xmath0 in the range @xmath29 , the absorbing - active transition is discontinuous for @xmath30 and continuous for larger values , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the tricritical point . for @xmath33 , the absorbing / active transition is always continuous .",
    "the mapping of dynamical systems to a surface - growth representation is an interesting problem , since in many cases the resulting scaling properties are unknown _",
    "a priori_. integration of the local activity ( with respect to time ) is the most natural procedure .",
    "the present method employs the interface representation proposed by de salles _ et al .",
    "the procedure consists in transforming the spatiotemporal patterns generated by the pca to a solid - on - solid ( sos ) particle deposition .",
    "the surface - growth process is attended by kinetic roughening ; the associated critical exponents can be measured @xcite following the scaling concepts developed by family and vicsk @xcite .",
    "atman and moreira @xcite demonstrated that the growth exponent @xmath34 exhibits a cusp at criticality , and is very useful for detecting phase transitions .",
    "height variables are defined by summing the variables @xmath35 over the first @xmath1 time steps : [ soma ] h_i(t ) ^t_=0 _ i ( )  . in this way",
    "we generate a growth process , with correlations embodied in the roughness @xmath36 @xcite , defined by [ rugos ] w^2(l , t ) =  , where @xmath37 is the mean value of @xmath38 at time @xmath1 , and @xmath39 denotes an average over realizations .    for surface growth models @xcite",

    "at short times , therefore , we expect @xmath47 .",
    "it is possible to measure @xmath34 from the slope of a @xmath48 plot of @xmath36 versus @xmath1 . in the active phase ,",
    "the roughness does not saturate , growing instead as @xmath49 , corresponding to uncorrelated growth @xcite , since the correlation length is finite , away from the critical point .",
    "in previous work , atman and moreira @xcite showed that @xmath34 attains a maximum at the phase transition , and measured its value along the transition line of the dkca .",

    "martins _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used the damage - spreading technique to show that the active phase of the dkca consists of two phases , chaotic and nonchaotic .",
    "the order parameter of this transition is the difference between two replicas initialized with different configurations , but subject to the same sequence of random events during the subsequent evolution . in practice",
    ", we let the system evolve until it attains a stationary state , and then copy the configuration , introducing some alterations (  damage \" ) .",
    "the two replicas , one with state @xmath12 and the other with state @xmath50 , then evolve using the same sequence of random numbers , and the difference between them , @xmath51 is monitored .",
    "the fraction of sites in the two replicas with @xmath52 defines their hamming distance : d_h ( t ) = _ i _ i ( t )  .",
    "the stationary hamming distance is null in the non - chaotic phase and positive in the chaotic phase .    to study the chaotic / non - chaotic boundary , we use a slightly different method , in which the _ difference _ between the replicas is used to generate a _ surface growth process _",
    ", as described above . in this case , [ acc2 ]",
    "h_i(t ) = ^t_=0 _ i ( )  .",
    "thus , the profile generated by the difference between the replicas behaves just as the profiles at the phase 0/active boundary : the roughness reaches a stationary value in the non - chaotic phase and grows indefinitely in the chaotic phase , with a cusp in the @xmath34 value at the transition .    since the system has already relaxed to the stationary state when we initiate the damage experiment ,",
    "creating the damage by randomly altering sites in one copy is likely to perturb the particle density and correlation functions away from their stationary values .",
    "this in turn would introduce an undesirable assymetry between the replicas , since the dynamics of damage spreading would be mixed with that of relaxation back to the stationary state ( in the copy but not in the original ) .",
    "to avoid such complications , we generate the damage by _ rotating _ the copy by 180@xmath53 with respect to the original , with no further modifications , that is , @xmath54 , subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this represents a large initial damage ( a hamming distance of @xmath55 , with @xmath27 the stationary particle density ) , which is statistically uniform over the system .",
