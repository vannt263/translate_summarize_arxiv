    "protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets .",
    "the complex structures of protoplanetary disks such as spiral arms , inner holes , and gap and ring , recently reported by high - resolution infrared observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , are believed to be potential evidence of unseen planets in the disk .",
    "most recently , high - resolution observations with alma have found multiple gaps and rings in a disk even at submillimeter wavelengths @xcite . since submillimeter emission better traces the midplane density structures than infrared , the gaps and rings",
    "are thought to be direct evidence of the absence and enhancement of disk material , and therefore related to the planet formation process .",
    "the origin of multiple gaps and rings is still under debate : several theoretical studies predict a formation scenario due to material clearance by planets @xcite , growth and destruction of icy dust aggregates near the snow lines of major volatiles @xcite , baroclinic instability triggered by dust settling @xcite or secular gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "tw hya is a 0.8 @xmath8 t tauri star surrounded by a disk at a distance of @xmath054 pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the disk is almost face - on with an inclination angle of @xmath9 @xcite , tw hya is one of the best astronomical laboratories to investigate the radial structure of protoplanetary disks .",
    "the disk mass has been measured to be @xmath10 @xmath11 from hd line observations by the _ herschel _ space observatory , indicating that it is massive enough to form a planetary system @xcite .",
    "recently , a gap in the dust emission has been found at 2030 au by submillimeter and near infrared observations @xcite , which is possibly associated with the co snow line @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite reported the existence of multiple , axisymmetric gaps at 1 , 22 , 37 , and 43 au at a spatial resolution of @xmath01  au .",
    "the depth and width of the submillimeter gap at 2030 au are consistent with clearing by a super - neptune mass planet @xcite .",
    "however , additional information on the dust size distribution with comparable spatial resolution is required to address the physical structure of the gap . in this paper",
    ", we report multi - frequency observations of the disk around tw hya with alma to probe the detailed disk structure and the change of dust spectral index across the dust gaps and rings at a spatial resolution of @xmath03 au .",
    "high - resolution continuum observations at bands 4 and 6 ( 145 and 233 ghz ) with alma were carried out on 2015 december 1 and 2 ( 2015.a.00005.s ) . in the observation period , 36 of the 12-m antennas were operational and the antenna configuration was in transition from c36 - 7 to c36 - 1 , resulting in maximum baselines of 6.5 and 10.4 km for band 4 and 6 , respectively .",
    "we employed the time division mode of the correlator , which is optimized for continuum observations .",
    "the correlator was configured to detect dual polarizations in 4 spectral windows with a bandwidth of 1.875 ghz each , resulting in a total bandwidth of 7.5 ghz for each observed band .",
    "the amplitude and phase were calibrated by observations of j1103 - 3251 , and j1037 - 2934 was used for absolute flux calibration .",
    "the observed passbands were calibrated by 5 min observations of j1037 - 2934 and j1107 - 4449 for band 4 and 6 , respectively .",
    "the visibility data were reduced and calibrated using the common astronomical software application ( casa ) package , version 4.5.0 .",
    "after flagging bad data and applying the calibrations for bandpass , complex gain , and flux scaling , the corrected visibilities were imaged by the clean algorithm .",
    "the visibilities at band 6 with uv lengths @xmath123000 k@xmath13 were flagged out because of significant phase noise . the uv sampling for baseline @xmath6400",
    "m was particularly sparse along the north - south direction ( i.e. , v - axis of the uv coverage ) , which corresponds to @xmath14 and @xmath15  k@xmath13 for band 4 and 6 , respectively .",
    "we have combined band 6 archival data ( 2012.1.00422.s ) , in which the maximum baseline is @xmath0500 k@xmath13 , with our band 6 data after applying a phase shift to account for proper motion and different input phase centers .",
    "there were no available short - baseline data at band 4 , hence only the long - baseline data were used for imaging .    to improve the image fidelity",
    ", we performed the iterative self - calibration imaging for each band data using the initial clean image as a model image . the interval time to solve the complex gain",
    "was varied from 600 to 90 sec for band 4 and from 1200 to 240 sec for band 6 .",
    "the resultant images after self - calibration were made by adopting briggs weighting of robust parameters 0.5 and 1.0 for band 4 and 6 , respectively .",
    "we also employed the multiscale clean with scale parameters of [ 0 , 100 , 300 ] and [ 0 , 50 , 150 ] mas for band 4 and 6 , respectively , for better reconstruction of extended emission .",
    "the spatial resolutions of the final images are 88.1@xmath1662.1 mas with a position angle ( pa ) of @xmath17 and 75.4@xmath1655.2 mas with a pa of @xmath18 for band 4 and 6 , respectively .",
    "the noise levels of the band 4 and 6 images are 12.4 and 28.7 @xmath19jy beam@xmath20 , respectively .",
    "to deduce the spectral index between the bands 4 and 6 and to obtain a combined image around the center frequency ( 190 ghz ) , we also used the multi - frequency synthesis ( mfs ) method using all of the corrected visibilities after the iterative self - calibration imaging ( _ nterm=2 _ in casa _",
    "clean _ task ; see * ? ? ? * for the mfs method ) .",
    "briggs weighting with robust=0.0 was employed for the deconvolution and we also employed the multiscale option with scale parameters of 0 , 60 , and 180 mas . using the mfs method",
    ", we obtain the combined image and the map of the spectral index at 190 ghz .",
    "the combined image achieves a better fidelity than the individual images since the observed data are combined to fill the gap in each other s uv coverage .",
    "the achieved spatial resolution of the combined image is @xmath21 mas , with a pa of @xmath22 , corresponding to @xmath23 au .",
    "the noise level is 15.9 @xmath19jy beam@xmath20 .",
    "figures [ fig : obs](a ) and ( b ) show the constructed continuum maps at band 4 and 6 , respectively . both images show circular multiple gaps and rings even though the resolution of the band 4 image is @xmath01.3 times larger than that of band 6 .",
    "the total flux densities are 152.0@xmath240.3 and 558.3@xmath240.7 jy for band 4 and 6 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : obs](c ) shows the combined image of the band 4 and 6 data with the mfs method ( hereafter mfs image ) .",
    "the mfs image shows circular symmetric multiple gaps and rings .",
    "in addition , we have resolved an inner hole with radius @xmath1 au as predicted from an earlier analysis of the spectral energy distribution @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the drop in the brightness temperature of dust continuum map recently found by @xcite .",
    "the total flux density integrated over the region with sn@xmath1210 is 360.3@xmath240.5  mjy at 190  ghz ( sn@xmath25 ) , which agrees well with the previous estimation at submillimeter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "there is no appreciable deviation from circular symmetry in the gaps , rings and spectral index @xmath26 .",
    "ellipsoid fittings of gaps and rings show the deviation between major and minor axes is within the errors ( @xmath27 ) .    to confirm the gap structures",
    ", we plot the deprojected radial profile of the continuum emission in the top panel in figure [ fig : radp ] .",
    "the flux density is converted to the brightness temperature using the planck function .",
    "there are two prominent gaps at 22 and 37  au , and relatively weak decrements are also seen at 6 , 28 , and 44  au .",
    "these observed features agree with those found by recent high - resolution ( @xmath01 au ) observations at band 7 @xcite .",
    "the full width at half maximum and the relative depth are roughly 7  au and 50 % for the 22  au gap if the background with a power - law form is assumed , and 3  au and @xmath28 % for the 37  au gap .",
    "the depths are deeper than that of the gaps at band 7 @xcite , while the widths are comparable .",
    "both the emission at band 4 and 6 show comparable brightness temperature inside @xmath29 au , the value of which is consistent with that of the band 7 emission @xcite .",
    "this result indicates that the disk is ( at least moderately ) optically thick in this region .",
    "figure [ fig : obs](d ) shows the spatial variation of the spectral index @xmath26 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) for its definition ) .",
    "the distribution seems to be axisymmetric , and therefore we make the radial profile of @xmath26 averaged over the full azimuth angle as shown in figure [ fig : radp ] .",
    "the spectral index @xmath26 radially decreases approaching the disk center .",
    "there is a prominent peak around 22  au with @xmath30 , which coincides well with the position of the gap .",
    "the enhancement in @xmath26 is possible evidence of large grain deficit since @xmath26 is related to the power - law index of the dust mass opacity if the emission is optically thin .",
    "the rapid decrease of @xmath26 inside the 22  au peak is partly due to increase of optical depth and partly due to decrease of the power - law index of @xmath31 , namely , the existence of larger dust grains near the central star ( see the next section ) .",
    "there seems to be two weak ( @xmath32 % ) bumps at 37 and 44 au which are coincident with the locations of gaps in the intensity profile as for the 22  au gap , implying that there is a correlation between the surface brightness and @xmath26 .",
    "the error bars in figure [ fig : radp ] are determined from the standard deviation determined by the azimuthal averaging .",
    "this is a conservative way of determining the error because it is the most dominant source of the deviation at @xmath125  au .",
    "in fact , the uncertainty map for @xmath26 produced by casa shows an error is lower than the standard deviation",
    ". the uncertainty in the absolute flux density does not affect the shape of the @xmath26 profile , but the absolute scale of @xmath26 .",
    "if the accuracy of the absolute flux scale is assumed to be @xmath33% , the @xmath26 scale would have an associated error of @xmath34 .",
    "therefore the weighted mean value is estimated to be @xmath35 , which agrees well with previous measurements for the entire disk @xcite .",
    "the intensity @xmath36 and the spectral index @xmath37 are related to the dust temperature @xmath38 , the optical depth @xmath39 , and the dust opacity index @xmath40 by @xmath41 \\right)\\ ] ] and @xmath42 here , @xmath43 is the planck function , @xmath44 is planck s constant , @xmath45 is the speed of light and @xmath46 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the optical depth is assumed to have the form @xmath47 .",
    "there are three unknown variables in equations ( [ eq : intensity ] ) and ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , which are @xmath38 , @xmath48 , and @xmath3 .",
    "if we assume one of them , we are able to derive the rest of them by using the observation data of @xmath49 and @xmath2 . here , we assume that @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 .",
    "we vary @xmath52 from 22 to 30  k and @xmath53 from 0.3 to 0.5 to see how the temperature affects the derived physical quantities . this assumption is based on our fitting to the temperature profile at the disk midplane in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the temperature profile models are chosen so that the observed brightness temperature does not exceed the kinetic temperature .",
    "the assumed temperature profiles , however , have no great impact on the following conclusions as shown in figure [ fig : tau - beta ] .    figure [ fig : tau - beta ] shows the radial profiles of @xmath54 and @xmath3 .",
    "the errors are estimated in a conservative way in which the combination between the maximum and minimum values of the error bars in the intensity and @xmath2 profiles is used for determining the maximum range of the error .",
    "the disk is optically thin at @xmath55  au in all the cases and marginally optically thick at @xmath5615  au .",
    "this is in contrast with hl tau @xcite , where an optically thick region extends out to @xmath57  au .",
    "we see a prominent drop in the optical depth at @xmath58  au , which likely corresponds to the inner hole derived from the sed @xcite and to the drop in the brightness temperature of the dust continuum map recently found by @xcite .",
    "the optical depth profiles have two dips at @xmath59  au and @xmath60  au .",
    "note that although @xmath31 can not be determined where the optical thickness is considerably high , the @xmath31 profile at @xmath6115  au is still accessible because @xmath62 is of order unity .",
    "overall , @xmath3 increases from @xmath00 to @xmath01.7 with when moving from the disk center to @xmath020  au , where the disk is marginally optically thick .",
    "this implies that sufficient large dust grains ( @xmath6310  mm ) exist at 510  au . radially increasing profiles of @xmath3 are also seen in other t tauri disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and compact distribution of the largest grains is suggested in the tw hya disk , too @xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable features of the @xmath3 profile is the peak at @xmath022  au , which corresponds to the location of the gap in the surface brightness profile .",
    "this indicates that large dust grains are less abundant within the gap compared to other locations in the disk .",
    "we also tentatively see the increase in @xmath3 near the 37  au gap ( and perhaps also near the 44  au gap ) , but further observations with better sensitivity is needed to confirm this .    at @xmath5615  au where @xmath64 , @xmath40 is derived to be ranging from 0.0 to 0.5 , and according to the theoretical calculation of dust mass opacity @xcite , small @xmath31 value suggests that the power - law index of dust size distribution is very small and and the maximum dust size is large ( @xmath12a few cm ) . also , the result suggests that the column density would be at least an order of magnitude higher than that at the 22  au gap , giving us the column density with an power - law index of @xmath65 .",
    "the steep profile is consistent with the previous measurement that large grains should be concentrated towards the inner disk region to reproduce the 9 mm emission @xcite .",
    "the discussions of @xmath54 and @xmath3 presented here are based on the assumptions of smooth temperature profiles .",
    "observations at additional bands ( preferably at lower frequencies ) may further constrain @xmath50 , @xmath66 and @xmath3 simultaneously . we note that our results are roughly consistent with the band 7 observations by @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath3 indicates a deficit of large ( mm - sized ) grains at the gap position .",
    "these facts support the scenario that the gap is caused by planet - disk interaction because it is consistent with the picture of dust filtration and trapping due to a planet @xcite . using the relationship that connects the gap shape with the planet mass @xcite",
    ", a planet with 1.5 @xmath7 may be responsible for the gap , assuming a viscosity parameter @xmath67 and a disk aspect ratio of 0.05 ( consistent with the assumption of @xmath68 ) .",
    "we note that similar values are derived from both gap width and depth .",
    "this planet mass should be considered as the upper limit since the formula by @xcite is for the gas gap and the actual dust gap may be wider and deeper than the gas gap due to dust filtration @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the multiple ring structures might be related to the snow lines of major volatiles @xcite .",
    "tw hya is suggested to have a co snow line at @xmath030  au @xcite , and our observations identify a bright dust ring near this snow line .",
    "this is consistent with the dust ring formation scenario by @xcite , in which icy dust aggregates experience sintering , disrupt , and pileup near major snow lines . as noted by @xcite",
    ", the 40  au bright ring might correspond to the snow line of n@xmath69 , which has a sublimation temperature slightly lower than that of co. however , the model of @xcite does not predict a strong radial variation of @xmath3 , thus not explaining the enhancement of @xmath3 we found near the 20  au dark ring .",
    "the multiple gaps with intervals of 510  au beyond the 22  au gap ( 22 , 28 , 37 , and 44  au ) may be reminiscent of dynamical instabilities within the disk such as zonal flow patterns driven by mhd turbulence @xcite , baroclinic instability driven by dust settling @xcite , and/or the secular gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "different dynamical processes act under different physical conditions and therefore , better constraints on the dust disk physical structure based on high resolution observations at other bands ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and constraints of the density and temperature structures of gas component are essential in determining the origin of such structures .",
