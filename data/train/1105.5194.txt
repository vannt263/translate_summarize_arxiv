    "recently , a lifshitz - type theory of gravity called the hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity  @xcite has been proposed aiming at a renormalizable theory of gravity with anisotropic scaling of space and time .",

    "it is assumed to recover the general relativity in the ir regime whereas it becomes a nonrelativistic gravity in the uv regime .",
    "now , there have been extended studies in various aspects of black holes  @xcite and cosmologies  @xcite . by the way , the hl gravity was originated from a lifshitz scalar field theory studied in the condensed matter physics as a description of tricritical phenomena involving spatially modulated phases  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the lifshitz - type theory can be also studied in the framework of the maxwell s electromagnetic field theory  @xcite and the scalar field theories  @xcite . especially , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the one - loop renormalization and evolution of the couplings have been studied in detail to investigate the emergent lorentz symmetry in various lifshitz scalar field theories .    on the other hand ,",
    "the effective potentials of lorentz invariant theories corresponding to @xmath5 have been studied through the functional evaluation  @xcite .",
    "they can be widely used in studying symmetry breaking and cosmological applications in spite of the zero momentum limit of the effective action  @xcite .",
    "as expected , for the case of @xmath0 , the uv divergence can be mild due to the higher - derivative lifshitz term which plays a role of uv - cutoff in connection with renormalization , which eventually gives rise to the different type of effective potential from that of the lorentz invariant theory .",
    "now , we would like to study the one - loop effective potential in the lifshitz scalar field theory with the anisotropic scaling of @xmath0 in order to investigate the behaviors of the uv divergence .",

    "so , we would like to consider the simpler case of @xmath22 neglecting the last term in eq .   for convenience",
    "; however , the full renormalizations in the one - loop approximation will be discussed in the last section . in section  [ sec :",
    "z ] , the uv divergence is properly regulated in the one - loop approximation so that the mass and the coupling constants renormalizations are performed .",
    "it is interesting to note that the counterterm for the highest order of the coupling constant is _ finite _ , which is in contrast with the conventional lorentz invariant theory .",
    "next , we investigate whether the critical temperature can exist or not in  section  [ sec : z : t ] .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out that the critical temperature to recover the broken symmetry does not exist in this approximation .",

    "in particular , we will discuss the counterterms for the most general action  .",
    "we now study a four - dimensional lifshitz scalar field theory of @xmath0 which consists of the only marginally deformed kinetic term and the full higher order of potential terms instead of the most general @xmath0 theory   in order for simple arguments .",
    "the classical lagrangian is obtained as @xmath23 by setting @xmath22 from the general action and the corresponding counterterms are expected as @xmath24 .",
