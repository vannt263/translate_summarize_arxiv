    "random variables : weibull , gumbel , and frchet .",
    "these three families of extreme value distributions ( ev ) are submodels of a single family of distributions proposed independently by von mises @xcite and jenkinson @xcite which is now known as the generalized extreme value distribution ( gev ) .",
    "usually large quantiles  q@xmath1 of probability @xmath2 of these distributions are of interest .",
    "different confidence intervals for these quantiles can be obtained depending on the model used , the gev or a specific subfamily of models ",
    "frchet , gumbel or weibull . under the selected model ,",
    "the usual procedure is to obtain asymptotic maximum likelihood ( aml ) confidence intervals which are symmetric about the maximum likelihood estimate ( mle ) and usually do not take into account the commonly marked asymmetry of the likelihood surface of large quantiles in the case of small or moderate samples and thus tend to underestimate the true value of the quantile .",
    "profile likelihood intervals for quantiles have not been fully explored in statistical literature for extreme value theory and neither have their coverage properties in the cases of small and moderate samples . in this work ,",
    "the coverage frequencies and lengths of likelihood intervals for quantiles are explored and compared to those of aml confidence intervals through a simulation study .",
    "in addition , the profile likelihood intervals for the shape parameter of the gev were also considered and shown to have good coverage frequencies .",
    "these intervals are of special importance since they can be used as an aid for submodel selection .",
    "the use of the exact likelihood function , described in the following section , is recommended for the case of small sample sizes where a weibull model might be reasonable , in order to avoid maximum likelihood estimation problems due to singularities of the corresponding density function .    as an example , a data set of yearly rain maxima collected at a monitoring station in michoacn , mxico is presented to exemplify the likelihood based estimation procedures .",
    "the relative and profile or maximized likelihood functions of a parameter of interest will be presented here . in addition , the exact or correct likelihood function is defined as well .",
    "these functions contribute to simplify and improve the estimation of parameters of interest such as quantiles of extreme value distributions . also , expressions for the probability densities and distribution functions of all the models involved are here provided , as well as for their corresponding quantiles , which are the main parameters of interest .    the densities of the three ev families for maxima are@xmath3 -\\frac{% x-\\mu } { \\sigma } \\right\\ } i_{\\left ( -\\infty , \\infty \\right ) } \\left ( x\\right ) , \\label{ec1 } \\\\",

    "usually the * continuous approximation to the likelihood * function as defined in kalbfleisch @xcite is the one used in most statistical textbooks to define the likelihood function for continuous random variables , without taking notice that it is an approximation .",
    "for an observed sample of @xmath17 independent continuous random variables identically distributed , the continuous approximation to the likelihood function is @xmath18where @xmath19 is the vector of parameters , and @xmath20 is the density function of the selected model .",
    "this continuous approximation to the likelihood is only valid if the density functions do not have singularities ( see montoya et al @xcite ) .",
    "for example , for a given observed sample , the joint weibull density has a singularity when the threshold parameter equals the largest observation , @xmath21 if the shape parameter @xmath22 is smaller than one , @xmath23    however , the data are _ always _ discrete since all measuring instruments have finite precision .",
    "therefore , the data can only be recorded to a finite number of decimals .",
    "thus the observation @xmath24 @xmath25 can be interpreted as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the precision of the measuring instrument , and so is a fixed positive number . for independent observations @xmath28 , the * exact or correct likelihood function * @xmath29 is defined to be proportional to the joint probability of the sample ,    @xmath30 ,   \\label{discrete}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 is the corresponding distribution function of the continuous model in consideration .",
    "allowing @xmath32 implies that the measuring instrument has infinite precision and that the observations can be recorded to an infinite number of decimals .",
    "since for a continuous random variable @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 for all @xmath36 and @xmath19 , this can not be the basis for obtaining a likelihood function .",
    "if in contrast , one assumes that the precision of the measuring instrument is  @xmath37 then conditions are required for the density function @xmath38 to be used as an approximation to the likelihood function @xmath39 as required by the mean value integral theorem of calculus .",
    "but if the density function has a singularity at any given value of @xmath40 then these conditions are violated and @xmath41 can not be used to approximate the likelihood function at that value of @xmath19 ( @xcite , section 9.4 ) .    as meeker and escobar ( @xcite , p.  275 ) mention , there is a path in the parameter space for which the continuous approximation to the likelihood @xmath42 goes to infinity , in particular for the weibull case , when @xmath43 and @xmath44 it should be stressed that the likelihood approaches infinity not necessarily because the probability of the data is large in that region of the parameter space , but instead because of a breakdown in the density approximation to the likelihood function .",
    "there is usually , as happened with all simulations considered here , though not necessarily always , a local maximum for this likelihood surface corresponding to the maximum of the exact likelihood based on the probability of the data shown in @xmath45    a useful standardized version of a likelihood function @xmath46 that will be used here , is the relative likelihood function that has a value of @xmath47 at its maximum , the mle @xmath48 and is defined as @xmath49so that @xmath50 values of @xmath19 with @xmath51 close to one are more plausible than values close to zero .",
    "a relative likelihood is easy to plot and to interpret .",
    "likelihood intervals or regions of @xmath52 likelihood level are obtained by cutting horizontally this likelihood function ; that is @xmath53for example , if @xmath54 under some regularity conditions , the corresponding likelihood interval has an asymptotic approximate 95% confidence level , using the chi - square limit distribution for the likelihood ratio statistic ( @xcite section 11.3 ) . however this result may also hold for moderate samples , and even small samples , if the likelihood surface is symmetric about the mle . in these cases",
    "the interval in @xmath55 is called a likelihood - confidence interval .    if the gev model is parametrized in terms of a quantile of interest , then the profile or maximized likelihood function of @xmath56 ( kalbfleisch , 1985 , section 10.3 ) is defined for sample @xmath57 as @xmath58the corresponding relative likelihood can be calculated as in @xmath59 profile relative likelihoods and their plots are very informative about plausible ranges for the parameter of interest , in the light of the observed sample .    in the case of the profile likelihood of the gev shape parameter @xmath14 ,",
    "the relative likelihood at @xmath15 is indicative of the support given by the sample to the gumbel model , which corresponds to @xmath15 .",
    "for example if @xmath60 the gumbel model has moderate or high plausibility and should definitely be considered as a possible model ; its fit to the sample should be compared with the fit of the best member of the family of ev models suggested by the sign and value of the mle @xmath61    summarizing , in order to make inferences about a parameter of interest , for example a quantile , the corresponding plot of the relative profile likelihood should be analyzed because it is very informative .",
    "inferences about the parameter of interest should be presented in terms of likelihood - confidence intervals , especially in the case of small or moderate samples .",
    "these intervals calculated for two large quantiles , @xmath62 @xmath63 and for the gev shape parameter @xmath14 showed through simulations , reported in the following sections , to have adequate coverage frequencies for moderate sample sizes @xmath64 , and even for @xmath65 in the case of gumbel and frchet models .",
    "for the simulation study , the samples of maxima were chosen to come from one of the ev distributions , ( or equivalently a gev distribution ) and not from a distribution belonging to the domain of attraction of an ev .",
    "samples were simulated from the gev with parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 for sample sizes of @xmath65 and 50 .",
    "additional values of @xmath69 @xmath70 and @xmath71 were considered as well as the previous ones , for @xmath72 in order to explore the cases around @xmath73 these cases are such that there are models from the three subfamilies of ev that are very close to each other .",
    "size 50 is frequently found in samples coming from meteorological applications , and sample size 100 was chosen to explore the effect of increasing sample size . for each value of @xmath14 and sample size ,",
    "10,000 samples were generated in matlab 7 .",
    "for each sample of maxima , the mle s of the parameters @xmath74 of the gev distribution were calculated using the continuous approximation to the likelihood function .",
    "this is the current procedure in extreme value literature .",
    "the cases where the singularities of this density caused numerical problems for finding the local maximum ( the mle ) were registered and the exact likelihood function was used then to obtain the mle s .    for each simulated sample , the corresponding ev model was selected automatically according as @xmath75 ( weibull ) , @xmath76 ( gumbel ) or @xmath77 ( frchet ) .",
    "the mle s of the corresponding parameters were obtained by maximizing the likelihood derived from ( [ ec1 ] ) , @xmath78 or ( [ ec3 ] ) , accordingly , reparametrized in terms of the quantile of interest , which worked well in most of the cases .",
    "only when @xmath79 and @xmath80 , it was necessary to use the corresponding exact weibull likelihood function , as mentioned above .",
    "these cases were registered , since they represent cases where the continuous approximation to the likelihood function would not have been able to produce an mle with these ev distributions .    using the invariance property of the likelihood function ,",
    "the mle s of quantiles @xmath81 and @xmath82 can be obtained from the mle s of the parameters of the ev or gev , though they were obtained directly from the corresponding likelihood function parametrized in terms of these quantiles . from their corresponding relative likelihoods ,",
    "15% likelihood intervals were obtained for @xmath69 @xmath62 and @xmath82 .",
    "as mentioned above , these intervals may have an approximate 95% confidence level in the case of moderate sample sizes , using the chi - square limit distribution for the likelihood ratio statistic ( @xcite section 11.3 ) .",
    "for each of these intervals it was checked whether they included the true value of the corresponding parameter in order to calculate the associated coverage frequency . for those intervals that excluded the true value of the parameter of interest ,",
    "the number of times that the interval underestimated or overestimated was registered .",
    "also the lengths of the intervals that covered the true value of the parameter were registered and compared as shown in the following section .",
    "in addition , the asymptotic maximum likelihood ( aml ) confidence intervals were obtained for @xmath81 and @xmath82 and their coverage frequencies were registered .",
    "tables 3 and 4 present the coverage frequencies for @xmath81 and @xmath82 of 15% relative profile likelihood intervals and their corresponding aml intervals in the case of samples of size @xmath83 and 100 .",
    "asymptotically these 15% likelihood intervals should have 95% coverage frequencies .",
    "table 5 gives the coverage frequencies of 15% relative profile likelihood intervals for the parameter @xmath14 of the gev model for samples of size 100 and 50 .",
    "the last two columns of this table report for each scenario the number of samples that selected the correct ev model according to the sign of the mle @xmath84 and the number of samples where the product of the interval endpoints was negative .",
    "these are cases where the three ev models are plausible , since the value of @xmath15 is included in the interval .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the coverage frequencies of the quantiles of interest contained in tables 3 to 5 in a graphical way .",
    "figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show the ratios of the lengths of the relative profile likelihood intervals under the selected ev model compared to those under the gev model and figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] give the length of profile likelihood intervals for the gev using boxplots in which the box corresponds to the interquartile range and the whiskers have a maximum length of 1.5 times the interquartile range .",
    "points beyond the end of the whiskers are represented individually and the line inside the box is the median .",
    "only samples for which all intervals covered the true value of the quantile were considered in these graphs .",
    "some remarks about the tables and figures are given below .",
    "note that ev submodels are selected automatically , based only on the sign and size of @xmath85 so the reported coverage frequencies correspond to a ` worst case ' scenario . with a real data set , additional external information from experts",
    "would be taken into account for choosing an adequate submodel , and consequently the statistical modeling would be more efficient .    1 .   * coverage frequencies of gev profile likelihood intervals and number of samples with estimation problems .",
    "* coverage frequencies of relative profile likelihood intervals for the gev were very stable throughout the range of values of @xmath14 for both quantiles .",
    "they tend to decrease as @xmath14 moves towards more negative values . for @xmath86",
    "there were no numerical problems when calculating the mle s .",
    "for @xmath87 the number of samples with numerical problems was insignificant .",
    "however for @xmath88 more samples presented problems in the case of weibull models with values of @xmath14 smaller than @xmath89 the number of problematic cases grows as @xmath14 goes to @xmath90 and is above @xmath91 for @xmath92 and above @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "the number of samples that had numerical problems was the same for both quantiles considered .",
    "therefore , numerical problems are associated to small sample sizes and weibull models with large negative values of @xmath95 2 .   * coverage frequencies of ev profile likelihood intervals .",
    "* coverage frequencies of relative profile likelihood function intervals for the ev were not so stable , and in all cases there is a region of decrease , mainly in the frchet domain , where frequencies drop , as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this region grows wider as the sample size gets smaller , and the value where the minimum occurs shifts to the right from around 0.1 for @xmath86 to around 0.2 for @xmath96 .",
    "the drop is always more pronounced for @xmath82 than for @xmath81 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that for the samples that did not cover the true value of the quantile , the mle @xmath84 was negative in most cases and the whole interval lay below this true value and therefore underestimated it ( see the second columns in tables 3 and 4 ) . in the frchet cases , these problems were associated to estimating a large frchet quantile with a weibull model that has a bounded right tail .",
    "3 .   * coverage frequencies of aml intervals .",
    "* aml intervals always had poorer coverage frequencies than relative profile likelihood intervals for the gev for all the sample sizes considered here .",
    "coverage frequencies for aml intervals calculated for the gev and ev distributions are almost identical .",
    "although coverage frequencies for these intervals improve as the sample size grows , as predicted by asymptotic theory , they can be very poor for @xmath65 and 50 , and still unsatisfactory even for @xmath97 this indicates that samples of greater size are required for these intervals to have suitable coverage frequencies . in all cases the intervals that failed to cover the true values tended to underestimate them .",
    "* asymmetry of proportions of intervals that exclude the true value . * except for one single case ( @xmath98 ) there were always more relative profile likelihood intervals that underestimated than overestimated the true value of the quantile .",
    "this asymmetry is more pronounced for smaller sample sizes , @xmath99 the asymmetry also increases as @xmath14 becomes smaller and is very marked in the weibull case .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the weibull distribution has a finite upper limit and intervals tend to increase in size with @xmath14 . therefore estimating a large quantile from a sample with @xmath100 will tend to underestimate the true value",
    "while in the case @xmath101 the interval will be larger and more likely to include the true value .",
    "however , even if this asymmetry is not desirable , the asymmetry of aml intervals is certainly much more marked than the one for profile likelihood intervals .",
    "* interval lengths . *",
    "almost always intervals obtained with the gev models are larger than those obtained with ev distributions as shown in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] . only samples where both intervals included the true value of the parameter were considered .",
    "the length of the intervals tended to be alike for large values of @xmath102 , although there is some asymmetry in this , with frchet intervals being closer in length than the corresponding weibull cases . also , the ratio of lengths is closer to one for @xmath81 than for @xmath82 . for both quantiles",
    "the largest difference occurs at @xmath103 for @xmath86 and @xmath104 , and at @xmath105 for @xmath65 . in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , the region where the interquartile boxes are visible ( i.e. where the length differences are more important ) coincides roughly with the region where there is a drop in the coverage frequencies for the ev distributions",
    "this shows that there is a trade off between coverage and precision in the choice of a model : there is the possibility of gaining precision in the estimation but a the risk of reducing the confidence level of the interval .",
    "it is important to note that for the same quantile and sample size , the lengths of confidence intervals grow with @xmath14 , as shown by figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "this is to be expected since weibull distributions are bounded above while gumbel and frchet are not .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the length between the true values of @xmath106 and @xmath82 of the corresponding distribution , as the parameter @xmath14 increases .",
    "* effect of sample size on interval length . * as one would expect , the length of the intervals decreases as the sample size increases , but not uniformly . halving the sample size from @xmath87 to 25 increases interval length by a factor between 1.84 to 2.65 , depending on the value of @xmath107 and by a factor of 1.56 to 1.78 when decreasing from @xmath86 to 50",
    "also , for a fixed sample size the length of intervals for @xmath82 is always larger than those of @xmath81 , as shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "* coverage frequencies of gev shape parameter * @xmath95 the coverage frequencies of the profile likelihood intervals of this parameter , shown in table 5 , are stable throughout the range of values of @xmath14 , with a slight decrease for the more negative values of @xmath14 .",
    "the proportion of intervals that underestimate is much larger than those that overestimate the true value of @xmath69 especially in the weibull cases .",
    "this asymmetry diminishes as @xmath108 takes larger positive values .",
    "* asymmetry in the correct automatic selection of a model . * the number of simulated samples where the estimator @xmath84 has the same sign as the true value of @xmath69 as the column correct  shows in table 5 , depends on the value of @xmath14 .",
    "although the difference is not pronounced , it is always more likely for the same value of @xmath102 that the signs coincide in a weibull case than in the corresponding frchet case . on the other hand ,",
    "it is more likely that intervals in the frchet case cover the origin , and therefore make plausible a gumbel model , as the negative  column shows in table 5 .",
    "in the state of michoacn , mxico , near its capital city morelia , there is a monitoring meteorological station located at the cointzio dam .",
    "this station is representative of rainfall patterns in this area .",
    "yearly maxima of daily rainfall were obtained for 58 years in a period between 1940 and 2002 . in this area , there is a marked rainy season from may to september .",
    "this data set will serve to illustrate the statistical modelling procedures suggested here . as a first step , the relative profile likelihood of the gev shape parameter @xmath14 shown in figure [ fig7](a ) assigns plausibility only to positive values of @xmath14 and the mle is @xmath109 therefore suggesting a frchet model . since rain data are necessarily non - negative , for physical reasons it is important to consider a frchet model with a non - negative lower threshold parameter @xmath110 that could very well simplify to a two parameter frchet model , where @xmath111 .",
    "the relative profile likelihood of @xmath112 under the three parameter frchet model shown in figure [ fig7](b ) , clearly assigns a very high plausibility to the value of @xmath113 so that the data appear to support strongly a two parameter frchet model . under this model ,",
    "the maximum likelihood estimates are@xmath114    figures [ fig8](a ) and [ fig8](b ) present together , for the sake of comparison , the corresponding relative profile likelihoods of these large quantiles of interest under the two parameter frchet model and also under the gev model without any restrictions to its parameters .",
    "the gev model without restrictions for its threshold corresponds as well to a three parameter frchet model without restriction to its threshold parameter ; the corresponding frchet mle s are@xmath115 in terms of the gev distribution s parameters , the mle s are given by    @xmath116    the likelihood intervals obtained for these quantiles with the gev model are larger and imply that larger values of these quantiles are plausible .",
    "also in these graphs , the aml gev intervals are marked and show that their right endpoints tend to coincide with the right endpoints of the profile likelihood intervals of the two frchet model for these quantiles ; nevertheless the left points are much smaller than the other likelihoods endpoints and therefore include small values of the quantiles that are implausible under both models ( two parameter frchet and the gev ) .",
    "that is , the aml intervals tend to underestimate the values of the quantiles .",
    "the likelihood ratio statistic of these two models for this data set is@xmath117since these models are nested , the observed value of @xmath118 has @xmath119-value of @xmath120 under the asymptotic chi - square distribution with one degree of freedom .",
    "the observed value of @xmath121 with a p - value of 0.32 , indicates that the two frchet parameter model makes the observed sample equally probable .",
    "however since the two frchet parameter model is simpler and fits adequately the data set as shown in figure [ fig9](a ) , this model should be preferred .",
    "figure [ fig9](a ) shows the corresponding quantile - quantile plot with pointwise likelihood bands that includes all observed values .",
    "moreover , this model should be taken into account due to the physical considerations stated above .",
    "likelihood - confidence intervals of 15% likelihood level and approximate 95% confidence level for the quantiles of interest @xmath81 and @xmath82 under the two parameter frchet model are @xmath122 and @xmath123 respectively .",
    "finally figure [ fig9](b ) shows the return periods plot with profile likelihood 15% level bands marked for both the gev model and the two frchet model . since rainfall levels higher than 200ml",
    "are associated with floodings of morelia , and since a return period of a 100 years is associated to quantile @xmath124 then the probability is extremely low that the city of morelia gets flooded within 100 years .",
    "overall , profile likelihood intervals of large quantiles of extreme value distributions and of the gev shape parameter @xmath14 performed well and had adequate coverage frequencies for moderate and small sample sizes .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding aml intervals are symmetric about the mle and had lower and poor coverage frequencies in the case of samples of size @xmath125 moreover , a large proportion of the aml intervals that excluded the true value tended to underestimate it .",
    "the aml intervals are frequently used in extreme value theory applications without notice of these issues .",
    "profile likelihood intervals of ev submodels tend to be shorter than the corresponding gev profile likelihood intervals when the true value of @xmath14 is close to zero , that is when @xmath126 if the sample size is @xmath127 .",
    "nevertheless , their coverage frequencies are adequate so that they should be preferred when the model selection of an ev is clear . however , if there is no additional external information on a given preferred ev model suggested by the theory behind the specific phenomenon of interest , then using gev profile likelihood intervals is a conservative procedure since they also had good coverage frequencies , even though these intervals tended to be larger .",
    "profile likelihood intervals of @xmath14 may serve as an aid in model selection .",
    "they also had adequate coverage frequencies .",
    "for values of @xmath14 in a region around zero @xmath128 approximately 95% of the likelihood intervals for the simulated samples included the value of zero .",
    "these are cases where the three ev models are plausible for the given sample , and also where the gumbel model usually has a moderate or high plausibility given by the relative profile likelihood of @xmath14 at zero .",
    "this is indicative of the need of additional external information of experts and other diagnostic methods to select adequately the best and most simple model for the phenomenon of interest .",
    "this will improve the estimating precision , and will prevent underestimating the quantile of interest .    finally , for sample sizes smaller than 50 and in the case that a weibull model might be an appropriate choice@xmath11 then the use of the exact likelihood function is suggested in order to make inferences about the parameters of interest through profile likelihood intervals .",

    "<S> profile likelihood intervals of large quantiles in extreme value distributions provide a good way to estimate these parameters of interest since they take into account the asymmetry of the likelihood surface in the case of small and moderate sample sizes ; however they are seldom used in practice . in contrast , maximum likelihood asymptotic ( mla ) intervals are commonly used without respect to sample size . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown here that profile likelihood intervals actually are a good alternative for the estimation of quantiles for sample sizes @xmath0 of block maxima , since they presented adequate coverage frequencies in contrast to the poor coverage frequencies of mla intervals for these sample sizes , which also tended to underestimate the quantile and therefore might be a dangerous statistical practice .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , maximum likelihood estimation can present problems when weibull models are considered for moderate or small sample sizes due to singularities of the corresponding density function when the shape parameter is smaller than one . </S>",
    "<S> these estimation problems can be traced to the commonly used continuous approximation to the likelihood function and could be avoided by using the exact or correct likelihood function , at least for the settings considered here . </S>",
