    "here we use the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) formalism , which involves solving the following constrained dirac equations : @xmath7 for njl@xmath0 it is convenient to combine the scalar and pseudo scalar condensates into a single complex condensate @xmath8 all _ static _ solutions to these hf problems have been found and used to solve analytically the equilibrium thermodynamic phase diagrams of these models in the large @xmath3 limit , at finite temperature and nonzero baryon density @xcite .",
    "these static solutions reveal a deep connection to integrable models , in particular the mkdv system for the gn@xmath0 system , and akns for the njl@xmath0 system @xcite . in this paper",

    "we solve these problems in generality , describing the time - dependent scattering of non - trivial topological objects such as kinks , baryons and breathers .",
    "some special cases have been solved previously , but here we present several entirely new classes of solutions to the tdhf problem .",
    "surprisingly , we have found that the most efficient strategy is to solve the ( apparently more complicated ) njl@xmath0 model first , and then obtain gn@xmath0 solutions by imposing further constraints on these solutions .",

    "let us briefly summarize how this has been achieved .    in a first round of investigations starting in 2010 ,",
    "the interaction of a small number of scatterers was studied in great detail by means of an ansatz method .",
    "the scatterers involved were kinks @xcite , baryons @xcite and breathers @xcite , all belonging to the gn@xmath0 model .",
    "the ansatz consisted of multiplying the scalar potentials and spinors for the individual scatterers and then varying the coefficients of some ( @xmath258)-dependent exponentials , until the dirac equation was satisfied .",
    "this could be done at the expense of considerable use of computational algebra , and led to the exact solutions of the problems considered .",
    "in the course of these works , many simplifying features emerged which enabled the authors to extrapolate the results to more complicated scattering processes involving @xmath3 scatterers @xcite .",
    "since a general proof was lacking , these results could only be checked analytically for few body problems , up to @xmath259 . in the simplest special case ,",
    "that of multi - kink scattering , the problem proved to be fully solvable for all @xmath3 , by mapping it onto the known soliton solutions of the sinh - gordon equation @xcite .",
    "several developments have helped us to solve the problem in full generality in the meantime .",
    "thus for instance , we realized that it is advantageous to solve the njl@xmath0 model first , and then get the gn@xmath0 solutions in a second step by specializing to real tdhf potentials .",
    "this strategy had been overlooked for a long time , and is indeed unexpected : the njl@xmath0 model has a more complicated lagrangian than the gn@xmath0 model . moreover",
    ", its continuous chiral symmetry forbids states with localized fermion density , whereas one is just interested in such ",
    "baryonic \" states in the gn@xmath0 model .",
    "the reason why the njl@xmath0 model is easier to solve lies in the fact that twisted kinks are the basic constituents of all tdhf solutions , and they appear in free form only in the njl@xmath0 model . nevertheless , they are also hidden constituents of gn@xmath0 baryons and breathers , as we have shown here . as for the question of fermion density",
    ", we have shown that the same construction of the tdhf potential can be used for both models , but the self - consistency condition is different , leading to different assignments of fermion number , but with the same condensate .",
    "a two step procedure for solving the tdhf problem has proven most economic . in a first step ,",
    "we have constructed a general family of transparent scalar - pseudoscalar dirac potentials @xcite , generalizing the method used for the stationary schrdinger equation by kay and moses long ago @xcite .",
    "this yields closed form expressions for processes involving @xmath3 twisted kinks . depending on the parameters , they describe kinks , bound states , breathers and scattering processes among all of these entities . in a second step reported in the present paper , we employ these transparent potentials in a tdhf calculation and prove their self - consistency . while the method is completely general , it requires diagonalization of an @xmath68 matrix .",
    "thus , for more than @xmath180 it is difficult to write general analytic expressions , so the occupation fractions of the bound states are best determined numerically .",
    "we have presented examples with up to 4 kinks , displaying a rich spectrum of scenarios , in particular as far as breathers are concerned . if one specializes these examples to real potential , either by choosing the twist angle @xmath167 or by pairing two twisted kinks to total twist 0 , one recovers all the preceding results from the gn@xmath0 model .",
    "in contrast to the earlier works , we now have the general proof of the dirac equation and self - consistency condition , as well as compact closed expressions in terms of determinants , valid for arbitrary numbers of constituent kinks .",
    "we have also learned that new kinds of breathers appear at each @xmath3 , so that one can not exhaust the dynamics of the gn@xmath0 model via bound or scattering states of @xmath180 objects only .",
    "the basic constituent common to all solutions is the twisted kink , which does not exist as a free entity in the gn model  it is hidden",
    ".    characteristic for integrable models is the fact that the transmission amplitude for a fermion on a compound object factorizes in the individual kink constituents .",
    "nevertheless , there are nontrivial back - reaction effects which require fermion filling - fraction conditions for a self - consistent tdhf solution .",
    "we have shown that the factorized scattering translates into an additivity of the kink masses for all bound states and breathers .",
    "it is also the key for finding the asymptotic behavior of the solitons after the scattering has taken place .",
    "this includes in general a deformation of the soliton shape , a time delay and ( for breathers ) a change in the phases of the oscillations .",
    "is this the end of the story ?",
    "given the fact that all static hf solutions are known , the only loophole is for the breathers .",
    "we have not yet completely ruled out that the ansatz we have used for finding transparent dirac potentials misses some exotic breathers with an even more complicated structure .",
    "however , in view of the simplicity of the underlying lagrangians , this seems very unlikely .",
    "here we collect the parameters used in the animations contained in the ancillary / supplementary material to the present paper , which can be found at the link on this paper s arxiv page .",
    "the fermion occupation fractions @xmath103 are not input , but the result of the self - consistency condition . for kinks , they can be computed as @xmath260 , therefore they are not given below .",
