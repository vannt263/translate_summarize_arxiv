    "current studies of galaxies are characterized by two major features : availability of large samples of objects ( galaxy surveys ) , and the utilization of the multiwavelength approach .",
    "such studies extend from the nearby galaxies to those close to the epoch of the formation of the first galaxies .",
    "a rate at which a galaxy forms stars is one of the more important properties in studying galaxy evolution .",
    "the multiwavelength approach allows us to employ a suite of star formation ( sf ) indicators  from x - rays to radio wavelengths .",
    "major effort in recent years was made to provide reliable calibrations for different sf estimators and to understand their differences , advantages and limitations .",
    "the most straightforward evaluation is achieved by comparing two or more star formation indicators for the _ same _ set of objects . while new galaxy surveys provide large statistical samples",
    "with which one can attempt such studies , the sample of galaxies for which more than a single star formation indicator can be applied is not necessarily large .",
    "moreover , various sf indicators are often applied for different redshift regimes .",
    "global cosmic star formation history is therefore the result of studies that employ different sf indicators .    among the most frequently used",
    "star formation indicators are the uv continuum ( usually at @xmath4  ) , nebular recombination lines ( primarily h@xmath2 , but also [ oii ] ) , far - ir dust emission , and the synchrotron radio continuum at 21 cm @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive review of most of these methods was presented in @xcite , together with simple formulae for the conversion of the true flux into a star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "recently , the use of other sf indicators has been explored , such as the x - ray continuum ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or the luminosity of pah features in the mid - ir @xcite .",
    "star formation indicators are only as good as the assumptions that connect a certain observed luminosity to the actual star formation rate , and therefore all are sensitive to various systematic uncertainties .",
    "one factor has proved more frustrating to account for than the others  the effect of dust obscuration on the uv and h@xmath2  star formation rates .",
    "in contrast to these two dust - sensitive indicators , bolometric ir luminosity and the radio luminosity are often considered to be `` true '' sf indicators .",
    "while this is certainly an oversimplification , such perception is bolstered by the very tight correlation of the ir and the radio luminosities , at least as observed for the normal galaxies in the local universe @xcite .",
    "however , even if they were perfect , ir or radio methods can not make uv or h@xmath2methods obsolete for many practical reasons .",
    "there have been a number of studies that compared the uv and h@xmath2  star formation rates  either as the observed luminosities , or by applying various schemes to correct for the dust attenuation .",
    "these comparisons were often carried out with respect to some dust - free sf indicator .",
    "@xcite used a sample of several hundred objects with h@xmath2  and uv measurements ( with the @xmath5-band photometry serving as a proxy for the uv ) , and compared them to the far - ir measurements compiled by @xcite .",
    "they find that in order to reconcile h@xmath2and far - ir luminosities one needs to apply a dust attenuation that is not fixed , but rather depends on the sfr itself . actually , this dependence is a consequence of the relationship between the dust attenuation and the far - ir luminosity found by @xcite .",
    "@xcite use an extinction curve to extrapolate the dust attenuations obtained for h@xmath2  into the uv regime , but find that such correction fails to bring uv luminosities to agree with the far - ir , i.e. , the simple application of the same attenuation mechanism to both the h@xmath2  and the uv emission does not appear to be correct .",
    "@xcite used actual uv observations of 50 nearby galaxies in two ultraviolet bands obtained with the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) , and compared them to h@xmath2  luminosities from the narrow - band imaging .",
    "they determine uv attenuation for 13 galaxies using the correlation with the uv slope @xcite , and measure h@xmath2  attenuation for 21 objects using the thermal radio continuum fluxes .",
    "they find that both can reach high levels even for normal galaxies ( @xmath6 mag for h@xmath2 , and @xmath7 mag for far - uv ) , and lend support to previous notions that the attenuation increases with sfr .",
    "@xcite confirmed that a better agreement between the uv observations from the foca balloon mission @xcite , and the fiber h@xmath2  spectra is achieved when attenuation corrections are taken to be luminosity - dependent .",
    "they also suggest that one perhaps can not use simple extinction curve scalings to convert h@xmath2  attenuations into uv attenuations .",
    "the breakthrough in resolving this problem came with the introduction of the two - component dust attenuation model of @xcite .",
    "this model was indeed motivated by the need to produce a consistent model for dust attenuation affecting h@xmath2  and uv continuum photons .",
    "it postulates the existence of short - lived ( 10 myr ) giant molecular clouds that affect photons producing the h@xmath2  line .",
    "on the other hand , the attenuation of the uv continuum , having timescales longer than the lifetime of giant molecular clouds , is predominantly produced by the diffuse ism ( after the molecular clouds have dispersed ) , at levels that are typically 3 times lower ( for a given wavelength ) than those in the molecular clouds .",
    "in this paper we will be using the @xcite model , thus testing it for the first time on a large scale .",
    "in addition to systematic trends , we should mention that some previous studies were finding that the measurement errors are smaller than the observed scatter .",
    "@xcite offer the explanation for this scatter as arising from the differing timescales over which h@xmath2  and uv sfrs are sensitive , so that uv could in some cases ( especially in low - mass galaxies ) detect a short starburst that is no longer observable in h@xmath2 .",
    "sometimes , the systematics are present in the observations themselves .",
    "@xcite showed that even the relatively reliable determination of h@xmath2  attenuation can be affected by the systematics when not correcting for the underlying stellar absorption in balmer emission lines .",
    "systematics can also arise with galaxy samples selected at different wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the main obstacle in obtaining uv measurements for a large number of galaxies in the local universe is that they need to be made outside of earth s atmosphere .",
    "for this reason in 2003 nasa launched the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ , @xcite ) .",
    "_ galex _  is currently conducting the first ever survey of the uv sky .",
    "the imaging ( in two uv bands ) is executed in several modes  from a shallow all - sky survey , to the ultra - deep fields . in this paper",
    "we are using measurements obtained in the medium - deep survey that is designed to image regions of the sky covered by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "thus we obtain a large sample of galaxies with both uv and optical photometry , as well as spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "_ galex _  and sdss data , and the resulting sample , are described in   [ sec : data ] and [ sec : sample ] .",
    "dust - corrected star formation rates ( and some other physical properties such as the stellar mass ) are obtained by comparing the observed colors to stellar population synthesis models to which the dust attenuation has been applied (  [ sec : sed ] ) .",
    "while we use full uv to optical sed , the sfrs are essentially constrained by the uv @xcite .",
    "the large size of our sample permits a robust statistical analysis .",
    "we compare our uv - based sfrs to the results of the major study of @xcite , who use sdss spectra to derive h@xmath2-based sfrs for @xmath8 galaxies (  [ sec : sfr ] ) .",
    "they employ an intricate scheme to correct for the fiber aperture effects .",
    "thus , our study also serves as a check on the reliability of their methodology .",
    "finally , we discuss star formation histories of different classes of galaxies (  [ sec : local ] ) and derive a uv - based estimate of the global star formation density at @xmath3 (  [ sec : sfrd ] ) .",
    "technical aspects of _ galex _  telescope , detectors and data products are presented in @xcite . here",
    "we give a summary of relevant information .",
    "_ galex _  surveys the sky in either the imaging or the grism spectroscopy mode .",
    "it simultaneously produces a far - uv ( fuv ) and a near - uv ( nuv ) image having a circular field of view of @xmath9 diameter .",
    "fuv and nuv filters are broadband , with effective wavelengths of @xmath10   and @xmath11  , respectively .",
    "we will denote the magnitudes measured in these photometric bands as _ fuv _ and _ nuv_. a single field of view imaged by _ galex _",
    "is called a _ tile_. a tile can consist of one or more _ visits _ , i.e. , individual exposures .",
    "_ galex _  surveys the sky in several imaging modes , which differ in the exposure time per tile . in this study",
    "we use the medium imaging survey ( mis ) , which is designed to maximize the coverage of the sky that is included in the sdss . typical exposure times in mis",
    "are 1500 s , yielding limiting magnitudes of @xmath12 mag ( ab system is used throughout ) .",
    "_ galex _  can not point in the vicinity of bright sources ( usually stars ) , which inevitably produces some gaps in the coverage .",
    "_ galex _  data used in this paper come from the mis portion of the internal data release 1.1 ( ir1.1 ) , which is an expanded version of the first public galex release ( gr1 ) of mis ( in both ir1.1 and gr1 the same pipeline , version 4 , is used to reduce the data and produce source catalogs ) .",
    "dataset consists of 705 _ galex _  tiles . because of the anomaly with the fuv detector , 98 tiles lack fuv images .",
    "the 705 tiles cover 797 sq.deg .  of the sky .",
    "each _ galex _  field is restricted to @xmath13 radius , close to the maximum field of view .",
    "radius field of view .",
    "this is because artifacts are more common near the detector edge , and the psf becomes distorted .",
    "since in this study we match sdss objects to _ galex_sources , the chances of a match with an artifact are small .",
    "also , while the psf at the edges is distorted , the total _ galex _",
    "flux is not affected ( see also  [ ssec : qual ] ) . ] because of the overlap between _ galex _",
    "tiles , the total unique area is 741 sq.deg . source catalog for each tile",
    "was produced using the sextractor software @xcite .    in our study",
    "we use fuv and nuv fluxes measured in kron elliptical apertures .",
    "we recalculate flux errors because they were incorrect in the pipeline version 4 reductions ( thus also affecting gr1 , cf.@xcite ) .",
    "kron magnitudes should represent a good measure of a galaxy s total flux .",
    "if both the fuv and the nuv detections are present , we use the aperture ( size , shape and position ) derived from the nuv image to measure the fuv light .",
    "we go from nuv to fuv because we are generally more sensitive in the nuv .",
    "we add zero - point calibration errors of 0.052 and 0.026 magnitudes to @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively to account for systematic inaccuracies .",
    "the calibration errors were estimated by analyzing the repeat imaging of a calibration stellar object , and confirmed by a large number of repeat observations of the same field @xcite .",
    "if a uv detection is present in only one band , we still measure the formal flux and its error in the other band ( using the aperture defined in the detected band ) . in some cases ,",
    "the optical source is not detected at all by _",
    "galex _ , in which case we note the sky background at the position of the sdss source and compute the flux error . in this calculation",
    "we use galaxy sizes that have been derived ( using a calibration based on objects detected by _ galex _ ) from sdss petrosian radii in @xmath16-band .",
    "finally , in some cases the fuv can not be used because the fuv image does not exist ( 15% of all galaxies ) .",
    "in addition to the ultraviolet data from _ galex _ , we use optical data from sdss data release 4 ( dr4 , @xcite ) .",
    "sdss is providing five - band broadband photometry ( @xmath17 bands ) , and the spectroscopic follow - up of most galaxies with @xmath18 ( main galaxy spectroscopic survey , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the official data products from the sdss collaboration , we use value - added galaxy catalogs produced by mpa / jhu sdss team .",
    "these catalogs include reprocessed sdss spectroscopic data , and some derived galaxy physical parameters that are based on the spectroscopic data .",
    "sdss catalog lists magnitudes measured in several different ways .",
    "we use modelmag magnitudes , which are the measurements of choice for relative fluxes ( i.e. , provide stable colors ) , while still capturing most of the total light .",
    "we apply slight adjustments ( @xmath19 and 0.02 mag ) to @xmath20 and @xmath21 magnitudes respectively to bring them closer to the actual ab system @xcite .",
    "we convert sdss magnitudes and errors into fluxes using the transformations given in @xcite .",
    "in addition to catalog photometric errors , we add 0.01 mag of uncorrelated calibration error to each of the bands ( see  [ ssec : qual ] ) , and , specifically for the @xmath20 band , we add an additional color - dependent error due to the red leak ( @xmath22 , based on @xcite ) . in rare cases",
    "an sdss magnitude would be missing and such band has to be excluded from the analysis .",
    "we further exclude from analysis individual sdss magnitudes that are nominally fainter than @xmath23 .",
    "these are invariably spurious , regardless of the listed photometry error . finally , we exclude magnitudes with errors larger than @xmath24 the typical error in that band ( we find typical errors to be 0.07 , 0.009 , 0.007 , 0.007 and 0.017 mag for @xmath20 , @xmath25 , @xmath16 , @xmath26 , and @xmath21 bands respectively ) . while large , we find these errors to be significantly underestimated . to summarize , except in cases listed above when we exclude certain individual flux points , our input data consists of 7-band photometry and spectroscopic redshifts from sdss .      of 741 sq.deg",
    "of _ galex _  unique imaging , 645 sq.deg .",
    "overlaps with sdss dr4 spectroscopic area , thus defining the solid angle of our sample .",
    "we estimate this area by counting the sdss galaxies that : ( 1 ) have spectra , ( 2 ) have a dereddened magnitude @xmath27 ( the faint end is taken to be comfortably brighter than the spatially variable spectroscopic limit ) and ( 3 ) lie at redshifts @xmath28 .",
    "we count such galaxies both in our survey , and in the full dr4 , whose spectroscopic area is known .",
    "the ratio of the two counts gives us the size of our survey area .",
    "this estimate should be good to within 1 sq.deg .",
    "there are 67,883 objects from the sdss dr4 spectroscopic survey ( not restricted to the main galaxy survey ) that lie in this area , and are spectroscopically classified as galaxies . for each of these objects",
    "we search for a match in the _ galex _  source catalog ( which already combines fuv and nuv detections ) within @xmath29 .",
    "our analysis of sdss point sources with a match in _ galex",
    "_  indicates that _ galex _  positions have a random error of @xmath30 in either r.a .  or declination ( becoming somewhat larger at the edges of the field ) .",
    "in addition , there are overall tile - to - tile offsets between _ galex _  and sdss coordinate systems of several tenths of an arcsecond . in any case , astrometric uncertainties are significantly smaller than our matching radius ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a genuine match can be missed if the centroid of the optical light is offset by more than @xmath29 compared to the centroid of uv light .",
    "we expect such cases to be quite rare , since at the mean redshift of the sample ( @xmath31 ) this offset would translate into a 7 kpc separation .",
    "a problem with matching in general is that what is considered to be a single object in one catalog can be resolved into multiple objects in another catalog , whether they are indeed separate objects ( blending ) , or actually belong to the same system ( shredding ) .",
    "this problem is more pronounced when combining catalogs with different resolutions , as is the case here ( 4 to @xmath32 for _ galex _  vs.  @xmath33 for sdss ) .",
    "however , in our particular sample this problem is not severe .",
    "sdss galaxies with spectra are relatively bright objects , and if more than one _ galex _",
    "object is found within the search radius our procedure was to take the one that is positionally the closest .",
    "since we are dealing with high - latitude fields where the density of foreground stars is not that high , this simple matching procedure produces reliable results . besides , we do have mechanisms of identifying the majority of incorrect matches at the later stage , when we perform an sed fitting to the combined _",
    "galex_/sdss photometry ( see  [ ssec : qual ] ) .",
    "since we combine photometry from two different catalogs there is a concern of photometric zero - point mismatch .",
    "we explore such a possibility in  [ ssec : comp_sf ] . in our final matched catalog",
    "we eliminate duplicate _ galex _  observations ( stemming from overlaps or repeat observations ) by keeping those that lies closer to the center of _ galex _",
    "field of view .",
    "we initially define our sample by applying magnitude and redshift cuts to galaxies with sdss spectroscopy ( note that objects spectroscopically classified as qsos are excluded ) .",
    "we require the dereddened petrosian magnitude to be in the @xmath34 range , where the faint limit is the nominal limit of the sdss main galaxy spectroscopy survey ( see also  [ ssec : kcor ] ) , while the bright limit is chosen to avoid objects with saturated sdss photometry .",
    "we require redshifts to lie within @xmath35 range .",
    "the lower limit is chosen to eliminate galaxies that may deviate from the hubble flow , i.e. , whose redshift distances could be unreliable .",
    "redshift distribution in sdss main galaxy sample peaks sharply around @xmath3 with few galaxies beyond our upper redshift limit .",
    "these magnitude and redshift limits are identical to those used in @xcite , to which we will be comparing many of our results",
    ". we will refer to the above redshift range as representing the `` local universe '' .",
    "there are 49,346 galaxies that meet the conditions defining our initial sample .",
    "good quality sed fitting ( see  [ ssec : fit ] ) is obtained for 98% of them ( 48,295 galaxies ) . in the rest of the paper",
    "we will use only this _ latter _",
    "sample and refer to it as `` all '' galaxies .",
    "note that since we retain objects regardless of whether they were detected by _",
    "( as long as they fall within the area covered by _ galex _ ) , our sample is only _ optically _ ( @xmath16-band ) selected .    throughout the paper we will use @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) cosmology .",
    "this work focuses on the physical properties of galaxies , such as their star formation rates ( sfrs ) and stellar masses .",
    "before we start analyzing the sample based on these _ derived _ properties , we would like to characterize it in terms of its _ observable _ quantities .    throughout this paper",
    "we will rely on optical emission lines to classify galaxies in our sample .",
    "this classification , based on the bpt diagram @xcite , plots the flux ratio of [ oiii]@xmath405007  and h@xmath41lines against the flux ratio of [ nii]@xmath406584  and h@xmath2lines . in this paper we fully adopt the bpt classification of @xcite ( hereafter b04 ) , which is based on emission - line strengths corrected for the underlying stellar absorption ( see their fig .  1 ) .",
    "the position of a galaxy in the bpt diagram indicates the nature of its ionizing source .",
    "the majority of galaxies in the diagram fall within one of the two branches .",
    "one branch lies mostly above the maximum line ratios expected from star formation .",
    "these galaxies must have some ionizing source in addition to young stars .",
    "most researchers attribute this emission to an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "specifically , the emission is associated with a narrow - line agn ( a liner or a seyfert 2 ) , also known as type 2 agn @xcite .",
    "note that any type 1 agn spectrum ( qso or seyfert 1 ) would have broad lines , and would be classified by the sdss pipeline as a qso and thus not included in this sample .",
    "following @xcite , b04 classify galaxies that lie on the lower portion of the agn branch , but with line ratios allowed by star formation , as `` composite '' ( star forming / agn ) galaxies . for galaxies that lie on the star forming branch",
    "we expect very little emission line flux to come from an agn @xcite .",
    "b04 required a s / n ratio in all four lines to be @xmath42 in order to apply the bpt diagram classification .",
    "however , in some cases a secure agn classification is possible even when only [ nii]6584 and h@xmath2  have s / n@xmath42 , i.e. , in cases when this ratio is larger then the one allowed by sf .",
    "b04 calls this class a `` low - s / n agn ( liner ) '' . following b04",
    ", we will study this class together with the agn .",
    "b04 also introduce the category of `` low - s / n sf '' galaxies .",
    "these are the galaxies that do not fall in any of the previous categories because their lines have low s / n , yet they have an h@xmath2  detection with s / n@xmath43 . while their lines are not strong enough for secure placement on the bpt diagram , if we nevertheless do so , we find that many object lie in the high - mass end part of the sf sequence , as well as in the lower portion of the agn branch .",
    "therefore , these objects represent a heterogeneous class .",
    "finally , there are galaxies without detectable lines , thus precluding the classification in the above scheme .",
    "b04 call this group `` unclassifiable '' .",
    "we will call them `` no h@xmath2 '' class .",
    "we find that in @xmath44 of galaxies in this class the h@xmath2  non - detection is due to some artifact in the spectrum or line - extraction pipeline .",
    "we exclude these galaxies from this class ( but not from the whole sample ) .",
    "the fraction of galaxies in our sample belonging to different classes is as follows : star forming ( sf )",
    " 27% , low s / n sf  19% , composite ( sf / agn ) ",
    "8% , agn  12% and no h@xmath2   33% .",
    "color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) is a powerful tool in assessing the basic properties of a sample of galaxies .",
    "historically , the study of cmds was preceded by the studies of a relationship between color and morphology .",
    "basic morphological segregation into disk - like spiral galaxies and spheroidal elliptical galaxies was established by @xcite . afterward",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) it was realized that spiral ( late type ) galaxies have bluer colors than the ellipticals ( early types ) .",
    "optical cmds were constructed for cluster early type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where they were found to form a narrow sequence ( the so called red sequence ) .",
    "field spiral galaxies also displayed the color - magnitude relationship @xcite , albeit with larger scatter .",
    "the bimodal nature of the field galaxy cmd became much more apparent with recent large scale surveys , in particular sdss @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the traditional optical cmds , a cmd in which the color is constructed from an _ ultraviolet _ and an optical magnitude has a particular diagnostic power . by virtue of contrasting the current ( or recent ) star formation as indicated by the uv light ( modulo attenuation ) to the total past star formation as indicated by the optical light ,",
    "the uv to optical color is a good proxy of a galaxy s sf history ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other axis ,",
    "one plots absolute optical magnitude , which is related ( modulo variations in the optical mass - to - light ratio ) to galaxy s current stellar mass .",
    "we present the observed cmd of our sample in figure [ fig : cmd ] . in this and",
    "many subsequent figures , the individual data points have been converted into a greyscale density scatter plot , in such a way that the shade of gray is proportional to the number of objects occupying a given `` pixel '' .",
    "such representation is desirable when dealing with large samples where it is easy to saturate a traditional scatter plot .",
    "unless noted otherwise , the figures are constructed from raw , unweighted counts .",
    "we will include volume corrections later , when appropriate .",
    "both the color and the absolute magnitude have been k - corrected to @xmath45 rest - frame bands (  [ ssec : kcor ] ) .",
    "the upper left panel shows the cmd of all galaxies with an nuv detection ( 85% of the total sample ; see table [ tab : errors ] for a breakdown of uv detection rates per class ) .",
    "a striking feature of a uv to optical cmd is the pronounced bimodality of blue and red galaxies .",
    "blue galaxies form a well - defined sequence extending to faint luminosities .",
    "the red sequence is somewhat more narrow than the blue sequence ( note that this becomes evident only after k corrections have been applied ) , and extends to intrinsically more luminous galaxies than the blue sequence .",
    "this is related to well - known fact that the most massive elliptical galaxies are more massive than the most massive spirals @xcite .",
    "the two sequences are separated by @xmath46 mag .",
    "if the two sequences are modeled as gaussians , one finds that there is an excess of galaxies in the gap @xcite .",
    "this is not the case in classical optical cmds @xcite .",
    "we will refer to the gap region and its population as the `` green valley '' @xcite .",
    "a detailed quantitative study of the _ galex _  uv to optical cmd is presented in @xcite .",

    "the cmd of composite galaxies ( showing both signatures of sf and agn ) are shown in the upper right panel .",
    "their @xmath47 colors are offset to the red compared to those of the `` pure '' sf galaxies .",
    "galaxies with narrow line agn ( lower left panel ) occupy the regions of the red sequence _ and _ of the green valley ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , most galaxies with intermediate colors are either agn or composites . star formation histories of agn will be discussed more extensively in ",
    "[ ssec : ssfr_agn ] .",
    "next , we have low - s / n sf galaxies ( middle lower panel ) , which indeed mostly lie on the blue , star - forming sequence ( preferentially its more luminous part ) .",
    "however , there is a tail of red galaxies which are probably contaminated by agn as observed in  [ ssec : bpt ] .",
    "finally , we have galaxies with no detectable h@xmath2(lower right panel ) .",
    "as expected , these galaxies form the bulk of the red sequence . however , there is a tail of galaxies of this class extending towards the blue colors .",
    "since the spectral classification used here is nuclear ( central @xmath48 ) it is possible that some of these galaxies are classified as not having h@xmath2  because of the dominant bulge , while the relatively faint star forming disk is giving a galaxy an overall blue color .",
    "however , as we discuss in  [ ssec : ssfr_noha ] , this is not the case for most of them .",
    "the cmds presented in figure [ fig : cmd ] require a detection in nuv .",
    "the remaining 15% of our sample with no nuv detection falls mostly in the red sequence ( as evidenced from their @xmath49 colors ) .",
    "these galaxies are too faint to be detected in the uv .",
    "spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting is becoming a widely used technique for deriving galaxy properties . it was pioneered in works of @xcite and @xcite . to first order",
    "it consists of comparing the observed sed to a set of model or template seds , and searching for the best match .",
    "it is assumed that the physical properties of model or template galaxies are known , and that one can use this knowledge to deduce the properties of an observed galaxy .    in this study",
    ", we compare the observed sed to a large number of model seds constructed from @xcite population synthesis code . to construct the models we",

    "formation of a galaxy is uniformly distributed between 0.1 gyr and the age of the universe .",
    "global metallicity is uniformly distributed between 0.1 and 2 @xmath50 .",
    "star formation histories are not single stellar populations , but the combination of an exponentially declining continuous star formation , sfr@xmath51 , with @xmath52gyr@xmath53 uniformly distributed over that range , and the random _ starbursts _ superimposed on the continuous sf .",
    "bursts are parametrized to have a duration uniformly distributed in the 30300 myr range , with a strength such that the mass produced in a burst is between 0.03 and 4 times the mass produced in the continuous sf over the present lifetime of a galaxy ( distributed uniformly in log ) .",
    "such parametrization conforms with most observational studies .",
    "finally , bursts are randomly produced so that the probability that a given galaxy has undergone at least one burst over a 2 gyr period is 50% .",
    "the above parameters define how the population synthesis for each model will be carried out .",
    "next , each of the above model seds is subjected to dust attenuation parametrized according to the two - component model of @xcite . for the @xmath54-band optical depth",
    "we randomly chose a value from a distribution @xmath55 ( it peaks at @xmath56 and has most values in the @xmath57 range ) .",

    "fraction of the optical depth that affects stellar populations older than 10 myr ( i.e. , most of the uv continuum flux ) is given by factor @xmath59 , with values ranging from 0.1 to 1 , peaking around @xmath60 .",
    "altogether , we produce 100,000 model spectra spanning a range of sf histories , metallicities and dust attenuations . note",
    "that since we pick input parameters randomly , we do not call our set of models a grid , which would suggests a set of points with equal spacing in parameter space .",
    "finally , we convolve the resulting model spectra with _ galex _  and sdss bandpasses at five redshifts equally spaced in the [ 0.05 , 0.25 ] interval , producing the libraries of model broad - band photometry . in each library",
    "we keep only models that have an age smaller than the age of the universe at that redshift .",
    "this effectively reduces the number of models from 95,000 at @xmath61 to 78,000 at @xmath62 .",
    "we also add effects of the intervening intergalactic extinction according to @xcite .",
    "our final libraries list model photometry as well as a number of galaxy parameters associated to that model ( such as the sfr averaged over several timescales , stellar masses , dust attenuation parameters , etc . )      in our study , the observed sed is constructed from _ galex _  and sdss broadband photometric fluxes ( the broad - band sed ) . for an observed galaxy at some redshift we select the model library with the closest redshift .",
    "we step through a library one model at the time .",
    "model flux points will have some arbitrary zero point , and in order to see how well an observed flux compares to the model flux we first need to find a factor @xmath63 that minimizes the @xmath64 between the observed and the model points . in other words , for model @xmath26 , we need to minimize the following expression :    @xmath65    here , the summation is over @xmath66 , the observed flux points are @xmath67 , and their errors @xmath68 .",
    "flux points of model @xmath26 are @xmath69 . by taking the derivative of equation [ eqn : chi2 ] with respect to @xmath63 , and equating it with zero",
    ", we find the scale factor @xmath70 that best matches the observed and the model flux points :    @xmath71    because we include non - detections that have meaningless fluxes ( small or even negative values ) , we use the observed fluxes _ without _ correcting for galactic reddening , and instead apply the reddening to model fluxes , which are always positive .",
    "this allows us to treat non - detections like any other flux point with a known flux error .",
    "reddening corrections for sdss magnitudes come from sdss database , and those for _ galex _  from relations in @xcite ( their eq .  2 for @xmath15 ) .",
    "the goodness of the fit between an observed galaxy and model @xmath26 is then obtained by inserting @xmath72 in place of @xmath73 in equation [ eqn : chi2 ] .",
    "note that only a single parameter is being fit  the scale factor @xmath63 .",
    "we emphasize that the word `` parameter '' when fitting is discussed should not be confused with ( in principle ) arbitrary number of _ galaxy _ parameters ( i.e. , properties ) that _ correspond _ to each model sed .",
    "therefore , since we have seven photometric points , there are six degrees of freedom . for a given galaxy",
    "we evaluate @xmath74 for _ each _ model as outlined above .",
    "now , each of these @xmath74 values will determine the relative _ weight _",
    "@xmath75 for the given model @xmath26 ( and therefore the weight of the galaxy parameters associated with that model ) as @xmath76 .",
    "we then build a probability distribution function ( pdf ) for every galaxy parameter of interest by compounding weights at the corresponding parameter value .",
    "we repeat the procedure for each of the @xmath8 models in the given redshift library .",
    "we normalize the final pdfs and note the parameter values corresponding to the 2.5 , 16 , 50 ( median ) , 84 and 97.5 percentiles of the cumulative pdf .",
    "we use the average of the pdf as our nominal estimate of the parameter value .",
    "since in the general case the pdf is not symmetric , medians , averages and modes will differ .",
    "for most relevant parameters in this study the differences between the median and the average are small .",
    "we do not consider using a mode , because due to the discreteness of the model parameter space , the mode can be stochastically offset from the bulk of the pdf , and is sensitive to pdf binning .",
    "for similar reasons we do not use a _ single _ model with the best @xmath64 ( i.e. , the maximum likelihood model ) as representative of parameter values , but we do keep track of the best @xmath64 values in order to evaluate the overall quality of the fitting for a given galaxy (  [ ssec : qual ] ) .",
    "additionally , for certain parameters we preserve more detailed information on the shape of the pdf ( in the case of the specific sfr and stellar mass , we actually keep their mutual two dimensional pdfs ) . in certain cases",
    "we will discuss the errors of the derived parameters .",
    "we use 1/4 of the 2.5 - 97.5 percentile range as a proxy for what would have been a @xmath77 error in the gaussian distribution .",
    "we will refer to these quantities as `` formal '' errors .",
    "we prefer the above - described bayesian approach ( e.g. , @xcite ) to often - used maximum likelihood , since it allows one to transparently test the dependence on the prior , i.e. , how well the data constrain certain parameters given that the shape of the resulting pdf can to some extent depend on the distribution of the given parameter in the model library ( especially when the observational constraints are poor ) .",
    "another advantage is that while the maximum - likelihood model might indeed correspond to a high probability density , in the case of extensive models such as ours , it might actually correspond to a negligible probability `` mass '' , and might therefore lead to misleading parameter estimation ( see for instance the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "note also that our technique properly accounts for the degeneracies inherent in some galaxy properties .",
    "imagine that we have two galaxy parameters whose values can be picked in such a way as to produce _ identical _ model seds . in such case",
    "our fitting will give _ equal _ probabilities to all of the degenerate models , and the resulting pdfs for each of these two parameters will therefore reflect the entire range that these parameters can take ( i.e. , there will be nothing to constrain the pdfs ) .",
    "if we then characterize the errors of those parameters using the width of the pdf , we will obtain very large values , i.e. , we will know that a certain parameter is poorly constrained .",
    "this , in effect , is in contrast to fitting using a _ single _ best - fit model , which would pick one of the degenerate models as the best - fitting ( and the corresponding parameter value ) , without giving a researcher an idea that there is an underlying degeneracy making the obtained value to be quite uncertain .",
    "finally , we want to emphasize that the widths of the pdfs ( and also their typical values ) have a meaning only if the observational errors have been estimated reasonably correctly , and if the overall fit ( which can be well characterized by the @xmath64 of the best - fitting model ) is reasonably good (  [ ssec : qual ] ) .      for our initial sample of 49,346 galaxies we obtain model parameters in the way",
    "described in  [ ssec : fit ] . for each galaxy",
    "we also note the @xmath64 of the _ single _ best - fitting model , @xmath78 .",
    "this value serves as an indicator of the overall quality of the fitting for a given galaxy .",
    "since we include galaxies close to the edge of _ galex _  field of view where we know that image psfs get distorted , we would first like to check if this affects the photometry , and therefore the quality of sed fitting .",
    "thus we look at the average @xmath79 as a function of distance from the _ galex _  image center .",
    "we find no correlation with the distance or degradation close to the edge .    in the ideal case , @xmath79 values would form a theoretical @xmath64 distribution .",
    "the average of such distribution should equal the degrees of freedom ( in our case 6 ) . before looking at the @xmath64 distribution",
    "we notice that @xmath79 values are systematically higher for blue galaxies compared to the red .",
    "we believe that this difference arises from the presence of emission lines in blue galaxies that effectively increase the discrepancy between the observed sed and the model ( line - free ) continuum .",
    "therefore , we start by comparing the observed and the theoretical @xmath64 distribution of red galaxies .",
    "initially , the observed distribution was shifted towards the values that were too low .",
    "this was indicative of photometry errors being overestimated .",
    "we arrive at the @xmath64 distribution that was well - matched to the theoretical one when we adopt 0.01 mag calibration errors in each of the 5 sdss bands . band , and between 2% and 3% for each of the four _ colors_. however , the individual _ magnitude _ errors ( which figure in equation [ eqn : chi2 ] ) are correlated , which is why we find them to be smaller than 2% .",
    "our results stay practically the same even if errors are increased , but the @xmath64 distribution then deviates from the expected one . ] while now the bulk of the red galaxies follows a @xmath64-like distribution , there is also present a tail of high @xmath79 values , in numbers well above any expected distribution .",
    "one can imagine that the main reason for the presence of @xmath64 outliers is that the data do not reflect the actual sed for some reason .",
    "we will investigate possible causes momentarily .",
    "the high-@xmath64 tail of red galaxies contains some 2% of objects .",
    "we decide to exclude these galaxies from further analysis ( although we do account for them statistically when making any kind of space density calculation ) . assuming that the reasons driving extreme @xmath64 values are color independent",
    ", we also clip 2% of the blue - galaxy @xmath79 distribution tail .",
    "this leaves us with 48,295 galaxies  our final sample .    while removing the outliers",
    "is necessary to have results not be biased by unreliable values , it is instructive to understand what causes some @xmath64 to assume such high values .",
    "we thus examine 22 galaxies with extreme @xmath79 values , distributed evenly in the @xmath80 range ( thus sampling galaxies with various sf histories ) . in 10 cases",
    "we find obvious problems with cataloged photometry .",
    "this is most often the case with sdss ( 9 objects ) , where the visual inspection of broadband seds and comparison with spectra indicates that some flux points are large outliers .",
    "next , in 7 cases we are dealing with either close galaxies being blended in _",
    "galex_(4 ) , or with sdss shredding galaxies into smaller photometric objects ( 2 ) . for one object",
    "it is unclear whether we have blending or shredding .",
    "further , in one case an object shows a clear qso spectrum , i.e. , the continuum is affected by the agn , yet it is spectroscopically ( mis)classified as a galaxy .",
    "finally , in four cases it appears that the broad - band seds ( and spectra ) are genuinely unusual .",
    "while their number is too small to affect the present study , this type of outliers deserves a special scrutiny .",
    "it needs to be explored if there exists any set of model input parameters ( sfh , dust attenuation , metallicity ) beyond our already wide range , which can produce a model sed matching these observations . for our full sample",
    "we also expect on the order of 10 cases where a foreground star of similar brightness is superimposed with a galaxy , and falls within the fiber , thus producing a `` composite '' galaxy / star spectrum which would fail the fitting .",
    "since our model libraries are calculated at some fixed redshifts , there is some error associated with the library redshift not perfectly matching the galaxy redshift .",
    "we thus contrast the @xmath79 values of galaxies having the maximum redshift offset ( close to 0.025 ) to those with no offset .",
    "we find a systematic increase in @xmath78 of 10% , which is too low to affect the overall @xmath64 distribution .",
    "finally , we want to assess the effects of the `` resolution '' of our model parameters , i.e , we can ask how extensive should a model library be that the resolution is not an issue . to that extent , we artificially degrade our model libraries by running full sed fitting using every 2nd , every 4th and every 8th model sed .",
    "we then compare average @xmath79 values from each run .",
    "overall , the quality of the fits are surprisingly stable .",
    "the run with every 2nd model produces only a 4% increase in @xmath79 values , while the run using every 16th model is 16% worse compared to the full library .",
    "this implies that increasing the extent of the library ( for the given range of input parameters ) would not bring significant improvements .",
    "this , of course , is not a general conclusion , but rather states that with the precision of our data the current number of models is adequate , i.e. , having a finer resolution of input model parameters would create model seds that are degenerate from the observational point of view .",
    "in addition to this , the @xcite models themselves are not likely to be of such an accuracy to warrant more extensive model library .      for deriving the galaxy properties from the sed fitting ,",
    "we are not required to know the k corrections .",
    "this is because for a galaxy at a given redshift we compare the observed magnitudes to model magnitudes with bandpasses that have been shifted to the matching galaxy s redshift ( i.e. , the redshift of the model library ) .",
    "therefore , the `` k corrections '' are present in the sed fitting implicitly . however , for some applications , such as constructing a cmd (  [ ssec : cmd ] ) , or obtaining @xmath81  weights (   [ sec : local],[sec : sfrd ] ) , we need to know the k corrections explicitly .",
    "the process of sed modeling allows us in principle to derive the k corrections alongside galaxy parameters .",
    "it even has the advantage of allowing one to construct a pdf for any k - corrected magnitude , which thus yields an estimate of a k correction _",
    "error_. we find this approach to be especially useful in k correcting higher redshift ( @xmath82 ) samples ( salim et al . , in prep . ) in the current case , given that our redshift range is covered by only 5 model libraries , we choose to calculate the k corrections using the publicly available code kcorrect v4_1_4 @xcite .",
    "the code allows _ galex _",
    "magnitudes to be used together with sdss magnitudes to constrain the sed fit from which k corrections are derived .",
    "we obtain k corrections using the same combined _ galex_/sdss photometry used for the sed fitting , except that @xmath83 uv detections are not used .",
    "we derive k corrections without a priori assuming an evolution of the luminosity function",
    ". we will explicitly correct for evolution where appropriate .    in cases",
    "when we require a volume - corrected sample , we assign a weight to each galaxy according to its @xmath81 value  the volume in which a galaxy would be visible taking into account redshift and apparent magnitude limits , and the solid angle of a survey . while our faint limit ( @xmath84 ) is also the nominal limit of the sdss main spectroscopic survey , we take into account that the actual spectroscopic magnitude limit varies from one spectroscopic plate to another ( i.e. , that it can be brighter than @xmath84 ) .",
    "thus , for each object we modify the volume by the spectroscopic completeness ( usually around 0.9 ) .",
    "we take spectroscopic limits and completeness values from nyu - vagc catalog @xcite .",
    "we caution that in order to calculate @xmath81 correctly , it has to be done iteratively , because the k correction depends on redshift limits that determine @xmath81 .",
    "we derive our sfrs from photometric constraints that extend from the uv to the @xmath21-band . however , it is the uv luminosity that constrains the sfr the most .",
    "therefore , in the remainder of the paper we will refer to sfrs derived from the sed fitting as `` uv '' , where quotation marks stand to remind us that it is not only uv information that contributed to these sfr estimates . in our model sed libraries we report `` current '' star formation rates averaged over several time intervals , most notably over the most recent 10 myr , 100 myr and 1 gyr . by comparing the formal errors of sfr estimates ( derived from 95 percentile range of each galaxy s sfr pdf ) , we find that the best - constrained sfr for the overall sample is the one averaged over the last 100 myr ( table [ tab : errors ] ) , which is the timescale for uv bright stars . for the star - forming class specifically , we find that the sfrs have slightly smaller formal errors over 1 gyr timescales than over 100 myr . on the other hand , sfr estimates on timescale of 10 myr for sf galaxies ( a timescale that matches h@xmath2  sfr ) have drastically larger formal errors , as expected since we do not have information to constrain them . in the remainder of the paper we will use sfr estimates",
    "averaged over 100 myr , which represent a good compromise between the quality and a timescale that is not too long compared to that of the h@xmath2  sfrs .",
    "b04 have developed a method of deriving sfrs from sdss spectra that is primarily based on the intensity of an h@xmath2  line .",
    "this represents the largest currently available sample of precise h@xmath2-based sfrs .",
    "obtaining accurate sfrs from sdss spectra is far from straightforward . for the purposes of this paper we briefly describe the procedures employed in b04 .",
    "the essence of the b04 approach was to model sdss spectra by first removing the absorption line spectrum using a combination of burst models from @xcite , and then to model the emission lines using the @xcite models which combine the @xcite galaxy evolution models with the cloudy photoionization code @xcite . also , the same two - component dust attenuation prescription of @xcite was used by b04 to model attenuation of the emission lines , and by us to model broad - band continuum attenuation . while conventionally the attenuation of h@xmath2flux is determined by comparing the observed h@xmath2  to h@xmath41  ratio ( balmer decrement ) to the theoretical one , the attenuation estimate in b04",
    "is constrained using many emission lines ( although it is dominated by h@xmath2/h@xmath41 ) .",
    "using a suite of models , b04 apply a bayesian approach to produce the probability distributions for each of the four parameters ( gas metallicity , ionization parameter , dust attenuation , and dust - to - metal ratio ) .",
    "b04 thus simultaneously produce attenuation estimate as well as the attenuation - corrected sfr within sdss @xmath48 fiber .",
    "sfr within the fiber is constrained by many emission lines , with the greatest weight carried by h@xmath2 .",
    "this is one reason why we will denote b04 sfr and attenuation estimates by `` h@xmath2 '' , with quotation marks again serving to indicate that not only h@xmath2  was involved in those estimates .",
    "the above procedure is directly applicable _ only _ to galaxies for which the ionizing source is predominantly star formation , and not , for example , an agn activity .",
    "b04 therefore calculate _ fiber _ sfrs directly from emission lines only for galaxies classified in the bpt diagram as star forming and low - s / n star forming (  [ ssec : bpt ] ) . for other classes of galaxies ( agn , composite , galaxies with no h@xmath2 ) for which either there is no emission line detection or the lines are contaminated by a non - sf ionizing source , b04 use the relation between the d4000 spectral index and the specific sfr ( sfr normalized by stellar mass ) that has been calibrated using the _ star - forming _ galaxies .",
    "therefore , for these galaxies , emission - line sfrs are used indirectly .",
    "this is another reason why we denote b04 sfrs as `` h@xmath2 '' with quotation marks .",
    "we will return to this calibration in  [ ssec : comp_all ] .",
    "the above procedure gives only the sfrs within the @xmath48 aperture of sdss spectroscopic fibers , i.e , the _ fiber _ sfrs . in order to obtain _ total _ sfrs , an aperture correction is required .",
    "the total sfr is the sum of the sfr within the fiber and outside of it . to estimate sfr outside of the fiber ,",
    "galaxies are first divided into a color - color grid , based on their _ fiber _ colors .",
    "then , for each color cell , a distribution of @xmath26 band - luminosity normalized sfrs ( sfr/@xmath85 ) is constructed by adding up all galaxies of sf or low - s / n sf class that fall within the given color cell .",
    "then , the color of a galaxy _ outside _ of fiber is used to select the appropriate color cell , and the sfr/@xmath85 in that cell is used with the @xmath26-band luminosity to derive the sfr outside of fiber .",
    "this is added to previously found sfr within the fiber to obtain the total sfr .",
    "in other words , the aperture correction procedure is based on two assumptions .",
    "first , that sfrs within fibers have the same dependency on color as the sfr outside of it , and second , that this dependency , calibrated with star - forming galaxies , applies to other galaxy classes .",
    "the aperture correction factors range from close to one ( no correction ) to around a hundred - fold . on average",
    "they are 0.9 dex for the entire sample and 0.6 dex for the star - forming class .",
    "the comparison between sf indicators serves the obvious purpose of providing a better understanding of each indicator , but also ensures the mutual check on the reliability of the techniques used to produce the sfr estimates  in this case , the sfrs based on uv ( this study ) and on h@xmath2  ( from b04 ) .",
    "we begin by comparing the formal errors of the two methods .",
    "note that b04 used a sample based on the expanded sdss dr1 . here , when we refer to b04 sfrs we mean the b04 calculations applied to sdss dr4 , and available as a part of mpa / jhu sdss value - added catalog . in table [",
    "tab : errors ] we show average formal errors in sfr for the entire sample , and for each galaxy class .",
    "we see that the formal errors of the two sf estimates happen to be comparable .    to facilitate the comparison , we first convert b04 sfrs that were calculated for @xcite imf to @xcite imf used in this study ( both with 0.1 - 100 @xmath86 limits ) . from @xcite models we find the conversion factor of 1.06 ( in the sense that kroupa imf sfrs are slightly higher ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : sfr_comp_all ] we plot b04 `` h@xmath2 '' sfr estimates against the `` uv '' for all galaxies in the sample ( throughout the paper sfr always means dust - corrected sfr ) .",
    "note that the `` uv '' sfrs exhibit 5 orders of magnitude of a dynamic range from all but negligible rates to those approaching 100 @xmath87 .",
    "we notice that a large number of galaxies ( those with higher `` uv '' sfrs ) has comparable sfrs . however , there is a plume of galaxies for which b04 sfrs are up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than the `` uv '' ones .",
    "this systematic discrepancy can not be explained by random errors of the two methods . recall that b04 do not derive sfrs directly for classes other than star - forming ( and low s / n star - forming ) , but instead use relations calibrated on sf class sample .",
    "thus , in figure [ fig : sfr_comp_4classes ] we break the comparison into galaxy classes ( omitting for the moment the sf class ) . for the low - s / n star - forming class",
    "( upper left panel ) , for which b04 sfr estimates do come from the emission lines , the comparison is generally good for the majority of galaxies ( apart from the overall offset that makes `` h@xmath2 '' sfrs higher ) . for the other three classes in figure [ fig : sfr_comp_4classes ] ,",
    "b04 sfrs rely on calibrations made using the sf galaxies .",
    "composite ( sf / agn ) galaxies compare relatively well , but the comparison becomes significantly worse for agn , where we can see both the significant offset for galaxies with higher sfrs , and the prominent plume for those with lower `` uv '' sfrs .",
    "finally , for galaxies for which no h@xmath2  detections were possible , the discrepancy is very large for almost all galaxies .",
    "it is this class that contributes the most to the plume seen in the comparison of all galaxies ( figure [ fig : sfr_comp_all ] ) . given that the galaxies without h@xmath2detections belong almost exclusively in the red sequence ( figure [ fig : cmd ] ) , the low sfrs rates estimated by the sed fitting ( `` uv '' ) appear more realistic ( see also  [ ssec : ssfr ] ) .",
    "also , such high sfrs as estimated by b04 would result in a high fraction of no h@xmath2  galaxies to have a detectable h@xmath2  emission , which is obviously not the case .",
    "in general , it appears that the largest discrepancies between the `` h@xmath2 '' and `` uv '' rates occur for galaxies with low sfrs , especially when b04 estimate sfrs based on calibrations that employed sf galaxies .",
    "b04 sfrs are the sum of sfrs within and outside of fiber . to trace the source of the sfr discrepancies , we revisit the calibrations used to derive b04 sfrs for non - sf classes .",
    "first , within the fiber , b04 base the sfrs for non - sf classes on the relation between the specific sfr ( in the fiber ) and the d4000 index calibrated using the sf and low - s / n sf galaxies .",
    "we show this calibration in both panels of figure [ fig : ssfr_d4000 ] as the dashed line ( this can be compared to their figure 11 ) . then",
    ", b04 use d4000 to determine the specific sfr ( and therefore the sfr itself ) of galaxies of other classes . in the upper panel of figure [ fig : ssfr_d4000 ] , we compare b04 relationship to our ( `` uv '' ) relationships for the star forming ( bold solid line ) and the low - s / n star - forming ( thin solid line ) galaxies .",
    "note that in principle we can not compare the b04 specific sfr inside of fiber to the total specific sfrs obtained from the uv , so the comparison is more for illustrative purposes . at d4000 @xmath88 either sf or low - s / n sf lines from `` uv '' compares well to b04 .",
    "however , notice that there are _ no _ galaxies classified as star forming beyond d4000 = 1.9 .",
    "therefore , from that point on , b04 relationship is based only on low - s / n sf class which are most likely just agn contaminants ( see  [ ssec : bpt ] ) .",
    "in contrast to b04 , the `` uv '' relationship for low s / n sf continues to decline as d4000 increases . in the lower panel of figure",
    "[ fig : ssfr_d4000 ] we show the same b04 calibration against `` uv '' rates for the agn ( thin solid line ) and galaxies with no h@xmath2detections ( bold solid line ) . in these cases ,",
    "the relationship for these two types as indicated by the `` uv '' is entirely different from that of the star forming galaxies , even at lower d4000 values . for clarity",
    "we omit showing the composite class .",
    "altogether , this leads to a conclusion that the relationship between the specific sfr and the d4000 index is not unique for different classes of galaxies .",
    "we tested if this is an artifact of the fact that d4000 comes from the central @xmath48 , while the specific sfr for `` uv '' is integral .",
    "we find that the relationships are qualitatively the same for @xmath89 and for @xmath90 samples for which d4000 probes different physical sizes . instead",
    ", the most likely explanation is that since d4000 and specific sfr are sensitive to sf activity on different timescales , the galaxies with differing sf histories will have different relationships . to much lesser extent",
    ", some of the differences could be due to metallicity @xcite .    given the level of aperture corrections ( a factor of several ) , the analysis given above does not provide the explanation for the large discrepancies we see when comparing the _ total _ sfrs .",
    "since the sfr outside of fiber dominates in b04 total sfr , we will now focus on the calibration b04 use to determine it . as outlined in ",
    "[ ssec : ha ] b04 aperture correction relies on the calibration of the luminosity - normalized sfr as a function of @xmath91 and @xmath92 color . using our uv - based sfrs",
    "we can test one of the two assumptions behind b04 aperture corrections  whether the sfr/@xmath93 calibration against color holds for different classes of galaxies . in figure",
    "[ fig : sfrl_color ] we plot sfr/@xmath93 against two colors that b04 use to determine sfrs outside of fiber .",
    "the bold line represents the relation from galaxies classified as star - forming .",
    "this is the basis for b04 calibration which they apply to other classes as well .",
    "the dashed and the thin solid lines show the relations for agn and galaxies with no h@xmath2 . we see ( left panel ) that as the @xmath91 color increases , the discrepancy between sf and other classes rises , and reaches some 0.8 dex for agn and 1.3 dex for no h@xmath2 .",
    "similar levels of difference are present against @xmath92 ( right panel ) .",
    "the level of these differences matches the discrepancies ( plumes ) in the comparison of b04 and `` uv '' sfrs in figure [ fig : sfr_comp_4classes ] .",
    "we can interpret these differences as reflecting the fact that the colors used for b04 calibration trace old populations , while the current sfr traces young populations , and it is not surprising that the two will differ for different classes of galaxies .",
    "also note that the discrepancies of specific sfrs of different classes of galaxies are qualitatively similar in the case of d4000 and in the case of @xmath91 color , which is not surprising since they are both sensitive to population age on the similar timescales , and are similarly not affected by the dust . to conclude , uv - derived sfr is subject to fewer limitations , so it can be applied to a more diverse types of normal galaxies .",
    "to avoid the problems indicated in the previous section , we need to compare the sfr estimates from the `` h@xmath2 '' and the `` uv '' methods in galaxies where h@xmath2  is well - detected ( s / n @xmath94 ) and arises predominantly from star formation , i.e. , to galaxies classified as star - forming ( sf ) . in figure [ fig : sfr_comp_sf ] we show the b04 `` h@xmath2 '' star formation rates plotted against our `` uv '' .",
    "we see that the comparison , spanning some three orders of magnitude in sfr , is exceptionally good .",
    "formal error bars are comparable , with the `` uv '' being somewhat smaller ( see table [ tab : errors ] ) . the scatter ( standard deviation of the difference ) of the two measurements is 0.50 dex .",
    "when @xmath95 outliers are excluded , the scatter is reduced to 0.36 dex .",
    "this is very well matched by the sum ( in quadrature ) of the formal errors of the two methods ( 0.35 dex ) , confirming that the two measures are predominantly independent .",
    "there is an average offset between the two sfrs of only 0.06 dex in the sense that `` h@xmath2 '' sfr is higher ( which reduces to 0.02 dex , i.e. , 5% , when @xmath95 outliers are excluded ) .",
    "however , figure [ fig : sfr_comp_sf ] alone can potentially hide some systematic trends between the two sfr estimates . where can the differences in the sfr estimates arise from ? deriving sfrs for either methods",
    "incorporates several steps : ( a ) obtaining full `` h@xmath2 '' or `` uv '' observed luminosity ( which in the case of `` h@xmath2 '' involves aperture corrections ) , ( b ) correcting the observed luminosity for dust attenuation , and ( c ) converting the luminosity into a sfr . while both methods perform these three steps simultaneously , we can still design tests that would differentiate between . given in some cases the large aperture correction applied by b04 , we first plot in figure [ fig : dsfr_apcor ] the difference in sfr estimates ( sfr residuals ) with respect to the level of aperture correction applied to `` h@xmath2 '' rates .",
    "we see no correlation .",
    "we also check , but do not find a correlation between the residuals and the apparent sizes of galaxies ( not shown ) .",
    "those are good indications that the aperture corrections of b04 are quite reliable for galaxies classified as star - forming . finally , we find that the sfr residuals exist when plotted against the stellar mass of a galaxy ( shown in figure [ fig : dsfr_mass ] ) .",
    "we have a change of sfr residual of 0.38 dex over the @xmath96 range , with @xmath97 dispersion of 0.330.41 dex around the running mean . to double check if the residuals are in any way connected with b04 aperture corrections , we limit the sample to farther , and therefore on average smaller galaxies ( @xmath90 ) . we still find that the residuals correlate with stellar mass .    before ruling out step ( a ) as being responsible for the mass - dependent residuals , we perform two additional checks .",
    "first , imagine there is an offset in zero points between _ galex _  and sdss magnitudes ( after all , they come from different surveys and are not measured in identical apertures ) .",
    "e.g. , if _ galex _",
    "fluxes were systematically overestimated , this could cause `` uv '' sfrs to be overestimated as well , possibly in such a way to preferentially boost blue , low - mass galaxies ( as the trend in figure [ fig : dsfr_mass ] would suggest ) . to test this , we perform full sed - fitting runs in which we make @xmath14 and @xmath15 fainter by 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.4 mag .",
    "we first check the quality of these new fits by comparing the distribution of @xmath79 values with the nominal ( no magnitude offset ) run .",
    "runs with 0.2 and 0.4 mag offsets produce evidently inferior fits , already suggesting that any potential offset can not be that large .",
    "the run with 0.1 mag offset , however , appears as good as the nominal run , with an even slightly smaller average @xmath78 .",
    "however , comparing the `` uv '' sfrs produced with offset _ galex _  magnitudes to `` h@xmath2 '' sfrs , we find that while slightly flattening the slope of the residuals with respect to mass , the trend is not eliminated .",
    "in fact , the scatter of the residuals around the mean is larger when modified `` uv '' sfrs are used instead of nominal .",
    "we also look at the quality of fits with _ galex _",
    "magnitudes offset in the opposite direction ( making them brighter ) , but such fits are evidently inferior .    the second test concerns sdss magnitudes . namely , b04 use cmodel sdss magnitudes to transform fiber sfrs into total sfrs , while we use model sdss magnitudes when performing sed fitting .",
    "therefore , we perform another sed fitting using cmodel magnitudes instead .",
    "first , we notice that the quality of fitting with cmodel magnitudes is noticeably inferior , stressing their inadequacy for producing reliable color estimates .",
    "also , the use of cmodel magnitudes does not remove the trend of sfr residuals , and the scatter of the residuals becomes larger than in the nominal run , especially at higher masses . with this test",
    "we exhaust the possibilities that discrepancies arise in step ( a ) above .",
    "we now move onto step ( b ) , i.e. , correcting the observed flux for dust attenuation .",
    "note that both b04 and this study use @xcite prescription for dust attenuation , the aim of which was to produce _ consistent _ treatment for h@xmath2 , and uv continuum attenuation .",
    "is the presence of the sfr residuals an indication that this dust attenuation model does not produce fully consistent answers ? in our sed fitting we keep track of estimates on @xmath58the dust opacity in rest - frame @xmath54 band",
    ". we can thus compare our @xmath58 values with those obtained by b04 ( which we denote @xmath58(``uv '' ) and @xmath58(``h@xmath2 '' ) , respectively ) . while we use the same model to constrain attenuations , b04 obtain them from the emission lines ( to first order from the balmer decrement ) , while we obtain them from the broad - band sed ( to first order from the uv spectral slope , @xmath41 , or equivalently , the uv color ) .",
    "also , b04 measurements are restricted to the fraction of the galaxy inside of the fiber , which can in principle produce some systematic differences .",
    "direct one - to - one comparison , shown in figure [ fig : tau_comp ] , shows a rough agreement , albeit with a large scatter due to relatively large errors of both estimates ( average formal errors shown as the error bar ) .",
    "looking instead at the distributions of the two @xmath58 estimates ( not shown ) , we find them to be very similar on the whole , with the @xmath58(``uv '' ) slightly offset towards the larger values with respect to @xmath58(``h@xmath2 '' ) .",
    "since we find sfr residuals to correlate with the mass , it is more instructive to check whether such a trend exists in the difference of @xmath58 estimates from `` h@xmath2 '' and `` uv '' . in figure",
    "[ fig : dtau_mass ] we plot @xmath58 residuals against the stellar mass .",
    "despite the large scatter , we find a systematic trend .",
    "the gradient is 0.47 ( equivalent to 0.52 mag ) over the @xmath96 range . for lower masses , `` uv '' @xmath58",
    "attenuation is higher than `` h@xmath2 '' , which implies that the observed uv flux is corrected more than @xmath58(``h@xmath2 '' ) would require , resulting in `` uv '' sfrs being higher than sfr(``h@xmath2 '' ) .",
    "the situation is reversed at high masses .",
    "this trend matches the sense of the trend of sfr residuals .    in order to establish whether the difference in @xmath58 estimates is the dominant cause of the trend of sfr residuals , we will try to modify one of the two sfr estimates ( e.g. , the `` uv '' sfr ) based on the difference in @xmath58 values .",
    "note that this is an approximate technique , since our sed sfrs are not `` corrected '' for dust by the application of a single number , but rather by a complex application of @xcite prescription on many different populations that constitute the model sed .",
    "nevertheless , for the purposes of this test we would assume that the attenuation in the fuv drives the correction of the `` uv '' sfr estimate .",
    "we therefore modify it with :    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is the difference between the attenuation in the rest - frame fuv as implied by @xmath58(``h@xmath2 '' ) and that determined from the sed fitting .",
    "we look at the parameters from the sed fitting to calibrate the relationship between the attenuation in fuv and the @xmath54-band opacity , and find the following relationship :    @xmath100    where @xmath101 , while @xmath58 and @xmath59 come from the sed fitting ( i.e. , they are `` uv '' measurements ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 is the coefficient in the @xcite model that determines the fraction of the total opacity affecting the diffuse ism .",
    "we modify sfr(``uv '' ) according to equations [ eqn : sfrmod ] and [ eqn : deltaafuv ] , and in figure [ fig : dsfr_corr_mass ] re - plot the difference in sfrs against the mass .",
    "the trend of the sfr residuals with mass has disappeared , and the difference stays within @xmath102 across the full mass range .",
    "the dispersion around the running mean is 20% larger than with the non - modified sfr residuals , which is to be expected due to the approximate nature of the modification applied .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the `` uv '' continuum and the `` h@xmath2 '' in essence produce identical answers for the star formation rate , the apparent difference stemming from different estimates of the attenuation that the two methods provide . with this in mind , we can also rule out other possibilities for the cause of the original differences in the sfrs , such as the reliability of converting the luminosity into a sfr ( point ( c ) above ) .",
    "also , these results show that , contrary to some notions , @xcite models can not be too much off in the uv .",
    "although we can now account for the sfr differences , we would still like to understand the origin of attenuation differences that cause them .",
    "related to this , we should try to determine which attenuation estimate ( emission - line or the uv continuum ) is more accurate . at this point",
    "we need to emphasize that our sed fitting has a non - flat prior distribution of @xmath58 ( described in  [ ssec : models ] ) , while b04 uses a flat prior , with attenuation taking values in the @xmath103 range .",
    "while the non - flat prior used in our study is a reasonable assumption , and the one that helps constrain the parameter space to physically realistic values , we would like to check whether the differences in priors induce any systematic effects . to that effect we first perform an additional sed fitting run , with the model libraries created with a flat attenuation prior , taking values in the @xmath104 range . at lower ( @xmath105 ) values",
    ", we find the distribution of the resulting @xmath58 values to be similar to the original distribution , while at higher values it displaces the original peak , located at @xmath106 , to a broader distribution peaking at @xmath107 .",
    "the latter is the obvious consequence of assigning equal probability to models with high attenuations . in any case",
    ", we end up with a @xmath58 distribution that differs more with respect to the b04 @xmath58(``h@xmath2 '' ) than did the original @xmath58(``uv '' ) .",
    "nevertheless , we proceed and check the relationship between the new sfr residuals and the stellar mass .",
    "the trend observed in the original relationship is still present , although it is somewhat weaker at low masses .",
    "anyhow , it appears that we can not force the two attenuation estimates to reach an exact agreement by a simple modification of the prior distribution used in sed fitting .",
    "next we will try to get a sense of which @xmath58 estimate is more realistic . since the direct comparison with an external independent measurement is not readily available , we will try to evaluate the differences using internal relations . for star - forming galaxies we expect attenuation to be correlated with the stellar mass . in figure",
    "[ fig : tau_mass ] we show this relation for our `` uv '' estimates ( upper panel ) and b04 `` h@xmath2 '' estimates ( lower panel ) .",
    "it is apparent that the latter defines a more tight relationship .",
    "also , @xmath58(``h@xmath2 '' ) spans a larger range of values than @xmath58(``uv '' ) ( 1.4 vs.  0.8 over @xmath96 ) .",
    "finally , , the dispersion around a running mean is some 20% smaller for @xmath58(``h@xmath2 '' ) .",
    "this all indicates that b04 @xmath58 estimates are probably more accurate .",
    "while the two @xmath58 estimates agree well on the whole ( figure [ fig : tau_comp ] ) , the `` uv '' estimate appears more poorly constrained , which may cause it to more often take values away from the extrema , suppressing the span in relationship with the mass . as a result ,",
    "the attenuation estimates for low - mass galaxies will be overestimated , and for high - mass galaxies underestimated .",
    "it is difficult to directly test this explanation .",
    "namely , if we restrict the analysis only to galaxies with small formal errors in @xmath58(``uv '' ) ( or alternatively small errors in @xmath108 ) , we at the same time bias the sample to smaller values of @xmath58(``uv '' ) .",
    "alternative explanation is that the @xcite @xmath109 extinction curve deviates from the true extinction curve in a way that would be mass - dependent ( or some quantity related to mass , such as the metallicity ) .",
    "a possibility that the extinction curve is mass - dependent is raised in @xcite .",
    "we would be able to acquire further insight by comparing both attenuation estimates to some external measure , such as the ir excess ( irx ) .",
    "@xcite have recently obtained irx attenuations from _ spitzer _",
    "mips and _ galex _  observations of sdss galaxies , therefore such sample can be used to include uv ( i.e. , sed ) derived attenuations .",
    "also , the sed - based attenuation estimates can possibly be improved by adding the near - ir data , such as the @xmath110 photometry from 2mass survey @xcite , which would improve attenuation estimates by placing stronger constraints on the stellar metallicity .",
    "in this work we are using sophisticated sed modeling to obtain uv - based star formation rates .",
    "in many applications such a detailed approach is not practical , or not even possible . in such cases one would like to obtain a reasonably good estimate of a dust - corrected star formation by applying some simple transformations to the uv photometry .",
    "while such methods have been used in many previous studies , here we will use the results of the detailed sed analysis to _ calibrate _ such simplified models , with a special emphasis on users of uv data obtained with _",
    "galex_. since for the foreseeable future _ galex _  will remain the only facility capable of observing a large number of galaxies in the uv , it is not without justification to treat its filters as defining some standard photometric bands in the uv domain .",
    "researchers who study high-@xmath21 galaxies in rest - frame uv can calibrate their blueshifted filters against _",
    "galex _  fuv and nuv response curves .    obtaining a uv - based sfr",
    "consists of k - correcting the uv magnitudes , estimating the dust attenuation of the fuv flux , and converting the dust - corrected fuv luminosity into a sfr .",
    "we assume that the user will correct their data for the galactic extinction , and then apply some standard k - correction procedure to obtain rest - frame @xmath14 and @xmath15 magnitudes .",
    "of course , obtaining reliable k corrections requires optical or near - ir photometry . to calibrate the relations in this section , we use kcorrect v4_1_4 (  [ ssec : kcor ] ) .",
    "we start by using the results of the full sed fitting to calibrate the well - known correlation between the attenuation and the uv spectral slope ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is often refereed to as irx-@xmath41 relation , although strictly speaking irx indicates ir excess , which is _ correlated _ with uv attenuation .",
    "irx-@xmath41 relationship for _ normal _ galaxies , such as those in our sample , has been previously studied with _ galex _",
    "data by @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : fuv_atten ] we show fuv attenuations ( @xmath111 ) obtained from our sed modeling , for galaxies classified as star - forming , plotted against the rest - frame uv color , which is linearly correlated to the uv spectral slope .",
    "we see that the majority of objects lies along the ridge .",
    "this confirms that there exists an `` irx-@xmath41 '' relationship for normal galaxies , not just for starburst galaxies as usually assumed . to quantify the relationship for our sample , and thus allow @xmath111 to be determined from _ galex _  observations of normal galaxies ,",
    "we fit a linear function to running medians ( with value from each 0.05 mag bin weighted equally ) .",
    "using the medians is necessary in order to avoid the fit to be affected by numerous outliers .",
    "also , we find that past some red uv color the attenuation does not seem to rise , so we adopt a constant value . in any case , @xmath111 exhibits a large scatter for such red colors .    @xmath112    where @xmath111 is in magnitudes , and superscript 0 designates rest - frame colors .",
    "this relation is plotted in figure [ fig : fuv_atten ] as a solid line . in many applications , especially at higher redshift , spectroscopic classification may not be available . in those cases one can select star - forming galaxies based on their color . for blue - sequence galaxies ( @xmath113 , and without applying any class selection ) one should use a slightly modified relation :    @xmath114    shown in figure [ fig : fuv_atten ] as a dashed line .",
    "note that these relationships are optimized for _ galex _  bandpasses _ and _ for normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "we overplot @xcite relation as a dotted line ( we used @xcite transformation to obtain @xmath108 from the uv spectral slope ) .",
    "apparently , this relation , constructed from a sample of starburst galaxies , is well above the majority of galaxies in our sample . @xcite and @xcite , using smaller samples ( rc3 and cluster galaxies , respectively ) also find that @xcite relation overpredicts fuv attenuation . @xcite",
    "derive a relation that exactly bisects our sf fit and the @xcite relation . also note that these relations pertain to the optically selected sample (",
    "since practically all sf galaxies are detected in uv bands , there is no additional uv selection ) . in general",
    ", samples selected at different wavelengths will have different irx-@xmath41 relations , as demonstrated by @xcite , using _",
    "nuv and _ iras _ 60@xmath59 m selected samples .    for a source with known redshift ,",
    "the dust - corrected , rest - frame @xmath14 is converted into a fuv luminosity .",
    "the final step requires converting the luminosity into sfr . following b04 notation , we define :    @xmath115    to be the inverse conversion factor between a dust - corrected rest - frame fuv luminosity ( in erg s@xmath53 hz@xmath53 ) and the sed - derived sfr .",
    "the conversion factors comes from the stellar population modeling that was used to perform the sed fitting . like the equivalent conversion factor for h@xmath2  luminosity , @xmath116 is sensitive to metallicity , albeit more weakly so . for our sample (",
    "the metallicity of which is on average @xmath117 ) , the median conversion factor is :    @xmath118    the above factor is given for @xcite imf , which is used in this paper .",
    "the often - used conversion factor given by @xcite for the @xcite imf is :    @xmath119    we find using @xcite models that the appropriate transformation factor between uv - derived sfrs that assume chabrier and salpeter imfs is 1.58 ( both with 0.1 - 100 @xmath86 limits)-derived sfr , uv sfr , or stellar mass . ] .",
    "thus our `` empirical '' conversion factor ( equation [ eqn : conv1 ] ) for salpeter imf becomes :    @xmath120    this implies that the @xcite conversion factor ( equation [ eqn : rob ] ) is 30% higher .",
    "we verify that the effect of the difference in bandpasses ( @xcite factor was given for the 15002800   range , while the _ galex _  fuv filter spans 13001800  ) is completely negligible .",
    "the actual reasons for the difference are two - fold .",
    "first , even when obtaining the _ model _ conversion factor using @xcite and the _ same _ assumptions as given by @xcite ( i.e. , solar metallicity and a constant star formation history ) , we still find @xcite conversion to be 15% higher ( i.e. , the corresponding @xmath121 is lower than one produced by @xcite ) .",
    "further , we have that our sample has average metallicity somewhat lower than the solar .",
    "this accounts for another 5% difference .",
    "finally , the remaining 10% difference stems from the fact that our sample has a variety of star formation histories , giving @xmath121 that is on average higher than that for constant sf history . to summarize , for optically selected samples similar to ours , we suggest using `` empirical '' conversion given in equation [ eqn : conv1 ] or [ eqn : conv2 ] .    finally , we combine the above ingredients and `` predict '' the sfr from k - corrected @xmath14 and @xmath15 magnitudes . in figure",
    "[ fig : sfr_pred ] we compare the sfr obtained using this simple prescription to the original sfr(``uv '' ) .",
    "we observe a good agreement for the majority of objects ( the greyscale scatter plot ) .",
    "in addition , for each bin in sfr(``uv '' ) we show a 1684 percentile range of the predicted sfr values , i.e. , their conditional distribution .",
    "this allows us to track the trend in the regions where there are few points to show on the greyscale scatter plot .",
    "we see that the predicted sfr starts to deviate at both the low and the high sfr ends , by up to 1 dex .",
    "good agreement is obtained in the @xmath122 range , i.e. , where the majority of galaxies lie .",
    "the reason for the deviations at low and high - sfr end stem from the inability to estimate @xmath111 reliably only from @xmath14 and @xmath15 for galaxies having extreme sf .",
    "no simple modifications of equations [ eqn : afuv1 ] and [ eqn : afuv2 ] are able to reproduce @xmath111 estimate of galaxies with extreme sfrs without destroying the agreement for the majority of normal galaxies . in @xmath123 range ,",
    "the 1684 percentile range is 0.35 dex wide , indicating that the predicted values have an equivalent @xmath97 scatter of 0.17 dex .",
    "therefore , the total error of the predicted sfrs in this range is 0.26 dex ( with the error of sfr(``uv '' ) itself added in quadrature ) .",
    "this is a small penalty considering the ease of the method .",
    "note that the prescription given here is optimized to produce good results for the large majority of galaxies , and that a result for any given galaxy should be used with caution .",
    "it is now commonly accepted that the star formation history of a given galaxy depends strongly on its mass ( for early work based on uv see @xcite ) , and to some extent its environment .",
    "to first order , we can characterize the star formation history using the specific star formation rate , which is defined as the ratio of the current sfr to the current stellar mass .",
    "thus , higher values of the specific sfr indicate that a larger fraction of stars was formed recently .",
    "the unit of specific sfr is inverse time , and it is thus often referred to as the galaxy build - up time .",
    "however , this should not be confused with an actual galaxy age , since the specific sfr tells us only how long it would have taken to build a galaxy assuming it had a current sfr throughout its lifetime , and assuming that the current stellar mass is close to the total mass formed in stars during a galaxy s lifetime ( the two are not the same because of gas recycling ) .    for each galaxy in our sample",
    "we construct a two - dimensional probability distribution function in @xmath124 plane as outlined in ",
    "[ sec : sed ] .",
    "we use full 2-d pdf instead of collapsing it into a single value in order to better represent low - sfr galaxies whose pdfs are often very wide ( i.e. , not well constrained ) in specific sfr , and in which cases the single value , such as the average of the marginalized pdf , would tend to artificially concentrate in the middle of the pdf . in figure",
    "[ fig : ssfr_mass_all ] we show the co - added 2-d pdfs in 0.1/0.05 dex wide bins . in the upper panel of figure [ fig : ssfr_mass_all ] , as in all previous figures in the paper , we show unweighted values , i.e. , each galaxy in our sample contributes equally to the greyscale density .",
    "given our redshift and magnitude limits , we adopt the @xmath16-band absolute magnitude limit of @xmath125 ( which we verify by constructing a luminosity function ) .",
    "this luminosity limit leads to the completeness in stellar mass of @xmath126 , which is below the plotted mass range .",
    "the dashed line is shown for reference and represents a constant sfr of @xmath127 .",
    "we see that lower - mass galaxies appear to be confined in a relatively narrow sequence which declines as the mass increases . at masses above @xmath128",

    "each galaxy s pdf is weighted by its @xmath81 value , i.e. , the sample is volume - corrected .",

    "each horizontal slice in effect represents a mass function of galaxies of a given specific sfr .",
    "it now becomes apparent that the sequence seen in the unweighted plot extends to lower masses , with an increasing number density of galaxies .",

    "thus the three classes appear to have had quite different star formation histories .",
    "this was to some extent indicated in the cmds ( figure [ fig : cmd ] ) , but is more striking now .    the star forming class ( sf ) , which forms a blue sequence in the cmd ( figure [ fig : cmd ] ) , dominates the high values of the specific sfr . the sequence that was obvious in figure [ fig : ssfr_mass_all ] stands completely isolated here . in the weighted plot",
    "we see an ever - increasing density towards the lower mass , which reflects a rising low - mass slope of the mass function of late type ( blue ) galaxies . while the typical sfr _ rises _ from @xmath133 at the low - mass end to @xmath134 at @xmath135 ( consistent with the assumption that the more massive galaxies contain more gas and therefore have higher sfrs ) , the specific sfr actually declines by a factor of 10 .",
    "the tightness of the `` star forming '' sequence ( note that the formal error of the specific sfr is only 0.20 dex ) represents an important indication that the galaxy s mass regulates the overall star formation history ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "these represent both galaxies classified as sf / agn composites , and `` pure '' agn ( those lying in the region of the bpt diagram where non - sf ionizing source is necessary ) .",
    "we have already seen that a significant fraction of agn hosts populates the green valley of the uv - to - optical cmd ( figure [ fig : cmd])the intermediate region between the blue and the red sequences .",
    "( however , note that in the optical cmd they would lie predominantly in the red sequence ) .",
    "a possible reason for the presence of these galaxies in the green valley is that they are entering the stage in which their star formation is being shut off , and the colors are becoming red as a result .",
    "@xcite , using the _ galex _  data , has demonstrated that if the sf of galaxies lying in the green valley is indeed being quenched , then their color evolution implies a mass flux ( transfer from blue to red ) that roughly matches the mass increase required to populate the red sequence between the epochs @xmath137 and @xmath138 @xcite .    in the middle panels of figure [ fig : ssfr_mass_class ] we present specific sfr against mass for agn and the sf / agn composites combined .",
    "the typical error of the specific sfr is 0.35 dex .",
    "galaxies with agn populate the region _ between _ the sf galaxies with no agn and the galaxies with no h@xmath2  ( adjacent panels ) , in a more striking manner than even in the uv - to - optical color - magnitude diagram .",
    "we note that these agn are of type 2 ( seyfert 2s and liners ) , which are not expected to affect the stellar continuum , especially not in the integrated galaxy light ( @xcite , and reference therein ) . in galaxies having a luminous type 2 agn , @xcite",
    "limit the agn continuum contribution to less than a few percent in @xmath16 band . assuming a power - law agn continuum of the form @xmath139",
    ", this limit corresponds to less than @xmath140 contribution in the uv .",
    "another indication that the uv contribution from an agn is low in the uv comes from the fact that the quality of our sed fitting for galaxies with agn is nearly the same as for the similar galaxies with no agn .",
    "also , @xcite explore _ galex _  imaging of a more nearby sample of agn hosts and find that their uv emission is quite extended , thus unlikely to emanate from the central agn .",
    "the fact that most agn have intermediate star formation histories , and that this region is _ not occupied _ by galaxies unless they have an agn , is remarkable in the light of recent suggestions that the agn feedback may be regulating the star formation of massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "still , we would like to know if there is a connection of galaxies hosting agn with normal star - forming galaxies with no agn . in figure",
    "[ fig : ssfr_mass_agn1 ] , we plot sf class ( thin solid contours ) , and separate agn into `` pure '' agn ( dashed contours ) and sf / agn composites ( bold solid contours ) .",
    "composites form the lower part of the agn branch in the bpt diagram , and the `` pure '' agn the upper part .",
    "contours encompass 10 , 30 , 50 and 70% of each class s objects ( i.e. , their pdf densities ) , with no @xmath81 weighting .",
    "we notice that composites `` bridge '' the normal sf population and that of `` pure '' agn , i.e. , they have values of both the mass and the specific sfr that are intermediate between the two classes .",
    "agn , in addition , have a tail extending to very low values of the specific sfr .",
    "another , more physically motivated way of splitting the agn hosts is based on the strength ( i.e. , the accretion rate ) of the agn itself , as indicated by its [ oiii]@xmath405007luminosity .",
    "we use @xcite dust - corrected [ oiii]@xmath405007  luminosities , and divide agn hosts into strong and weak agn , using their demarcation of @xmath93[oiii ] = @xmath141 .",
    "we apply this division on all galaxies lying on the agn branch of the bpt diagram ( we refer the reader to @xcite for a visual presentation of where agn of various strengths lie on the bpt diagram ) .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : ssfr_mass_agn2 ] the relation between the specific sfr and mass for sf galaxies ( thin solid contours ) , strong ( bold solid contours ) and weak ( dashed contours ) agn .",
    "apparently , strong agn lie on the massive _ continuation _ of the sf sequence , with sfrs as _ high _ as those of the massive galaxies of the sf class ( i.e. , the offset from the dashed line is similar ) .",
    "higher masses with similar sfrs makes their specific sfrs take more intermediate values",
    ". weak agn fall at lower star formation rates relative to the strong agn , with a tail toward very low star formation rates that extends well into the domain of the quiescent galaxies ( see below ) .",
    "@xcite , using the optical spectroscopy , found that strong agn have younger populations than weak agn , which we qualitatively confirm , and provide a closer connection between strong agn and normal sf galaxies .    here",
    ", we propose an evolutionary progression for massive galaxies : from sf galaxies with no agn , to strong agn that are more massive yet with similar sfrs , to weak agn that have masses similar to strong agn but have lower ( more suppressed ) sfrs .",
    "thus , the weak agn would represent a population with fading star formation .",
    "we emphasize that while most optical and structural properties of the majority of agn would place them in the optical _ red _ sequence , we find that they represent a smooth , massive extension of the star forming sequence defined by optically _ blue _ galaxies .",
    "this picture is supplemented by the results of @xcite .",
    "they confirm that the majority of blue @xmath47 galaxies with high velocity dispersion host agn , and suggest that strong agn require extended gas - rich disks to provide a reservoir of gas that is fueled into an agn .",
    "previously , without the uv data , @xcite suggested that many type 2 agn are post - starburst systems .",
    "such a possibility , by itself , allows at least two different evolutionary scenarios .",
    "one in which a normal red - sequence galaxy experiences a burst ( say , through a minor gas - rich merger ) which also fuels an agn , and another , in which the agn is originally concurrent with normal sf . our results , showing a smooth sequence that begins with sf galaxies without agn and extends at its massive end to agn hosts with different levels of star formation , appear more compatible with the second scenario .",
    "while neither @xcite nor our study directly proves that agn are actually responsible for the subsequent quenching of the star formation , they do provide more evidence for the connection between the agn and the fading star formation in massive galaxies .",
    "such picture is qualitatively compatible with recent theoretical work based on @xmath142-body simulations of galaxy evolution and semi - analytic treatment of feedback .",
    "specifically , the `` radio''-mode agn feedback , proposed by @xcite , demonstrates that the galaxies situated in dark halos above some mass start to suppress the accretion of gas , and at the same time suppress further star formation .",
    "these are called `` radio '' agn because they can have black hole accretion rates well below eddington , as is the case in our sample . also , this mechanism is efficient in very massive galaxies . from the weighted plot of agn ( lower middle panel of figure [",
    "fig : ssfr_mass_class ] ) we find that the mass function of agn peaks at around @xmath143 , and has an abrupt turn - over at lower masses .",
    "this was noted by @xcite who also demonstrate that the low - mass cutoff is not likely to be a selection effect ; if a low - mass galaxy contained anything but the very weakest agn it would be classified as an agn in the bpt diagram .",
    "the connection that _ galex _",
    "has provided between the sf galaxies and the agn feedback is quite reassuring , and evidently further work is required to complete this picture .      finally , we concentrate on galaxies for which no h@xmath2  emission was detected in sdss spectra .",
    "these galaxies have red _ optical _ colors , which puts them in the `` red sequence '' category .",
    "these galaxies are often referred to as `` old , red and dead '' , because of the presumably old populations and the lack of current sf .",
    "however , in the uv to optical colors ( figure [ fig : cmd ] ) we saw that some of these galaxies have relatively blue colors ( which indicates that one needs to be careful when using the term such as `` red sequence '' , since it apparently depends on the color used ) . in the right - hand panels of figure [ fig : ssfr_mass_class ] we show specific sfrs of galaxies with no h@xmath2 . in the unweighted plot",
    "they occupy a region of the parameter space distinct from the star - forming and agn galaxies , with specific sfrs typically lower than for those two classes .",
    "the volume - corrected plot still puts the bulk of them lower than the other two classes , but the overlap with the low specific - sfr tail of the agn is more prominent .",
    "also , the mass extent is now displayed accurately , with the mass function turning over and flattening at lower masses .",
    "if we expect most red - sequence galaxies to have no star formation at all , how do we interpret the ( specific ) sfrs derived here ?",
    "first , we note that the specific sfrs ( and also just the sfrs ) are more poorly constrained than for any other class ( average formal error in specific sfr is 0.63 dex ) .",
    "this should be interpreted in a way that the observed seds are in many cases compatible with a very wide range of sfrs , mostly very low ones .",
    "let us note that our model sf histories do not contain truncated models , but only exponentially declining models ( with added starbursts ) , which can never reach exact zero sfr .",
    "the dynamic range of sfr in models is determined by the range of exponential timescales , which in our case have a minimal e - folding time of 1 gyr .",
    "this produces a lower limit of @xmath144 , which is roughly equivalent to the lower limit in the specific sfr shown in figure [ fig : ssfr_mass_class ] .",
    "while many galaxies in this class are compatible with this lower limit , they do not cluster close to it , because in the absence of stronger constraints , higher sfrs will also be allowed ( i.e. , to firmly constrain that the sfr is , say , smaller than @xmath145 one needs to measure a very low amount of uv light with a very high precision ) . however , there are clear cases in which a galaxy classified as having no h@xmath2  has a relatively well constrained sfr . for some of them",
    "it is as high as @xmath146 ( crossing the dashed line ) .",
    "what is the morphology of galaxies with high ( specific ) sfrs , yet no h@xmath2  emission ?",
    "there are 837 galaxies with @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "we inspect sdss images of these galaxies .",
    "most appear as normal early - type galaxies ( with several obvious e+a types ) , which was already indicated in @xcite who find that some morphologically and spectroscopically early - type galaxies show blue uv - to - optical colors .",
    "however , one quarter shows some sign of structure or a disturbed light profile .",
    "this fraction would very likely be higher in deeper images or images with higher spatial resolution .",
    "one quarter of galaxies with structure show traces of spiral arms . in most cases",
    "these spiral arms are faint , and possibly represent cases where the star formation was recently shut down ( leading to the lack of emission lines ) , yet the residual uv light and the spiral structure remain .",
    "such galaxies have been recognized in galaxy clusters as `` passive spirals '' @xcite , and are believed to represent a transition between a spiral and an s0 galaxy . in the inspected sample these galaxies",
    "are found at all redshifts , indicating that the reason h@xmath2is not detected is most likely not due to the aperture size being smaller than the size of the galaxy from which the integral flux is measured ( especially for more nearby galaxies ) .",
    "many of the galaxies with structure exhibit rings  from very faint ones to bright blue ones . in some of those cases sf could be occurring outside of the spectroscopic fiber , leading to non - detection of h@xmath2 .",
    "one can be concerned that our models attribute the uv light from old populations ( the uv `` upturn '' ) to young stars , thus implying an artificially high star formation rate .",
    "@xcite models do include post - agb phases , but not the extreme blue horizontal branch , which is believed ( by no means unanimously ) to be responsible for the uv upturn in early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite explore nearby `` pure '' elliptical galaxies and find that both the uv and the optical colors that they observe are fully reproduced in the models that we use in this work , and that if the uv excess from the actual star - formation is present , it is discernible from the combination of uv and optical colors .",
    "therefore , our models do appear to account for uv light from old populations and therefore some of the objects with no h@xmath2  emission are quite likely to have had actual recent sf .",
    "this conclusion is also reached in other studies based on _ galex _  data @xcite , where the blue uv - to - optical colors of morphologically selected early - type galaxies are interpreted as signs of recent star formation .",
    "it is quite conceivable that these galaxies are in a post - starburst phase , so that the h@xmath2  emission is no longer present , while the traces of star formation are still visible in the uv . in evolutionary terms , as in the case of agn , a question remains whether this recent sf is the sign of a previously normal sf that is now quenched , or is it the result of a small sf episode in an already quiescent galaxy . in the latter case , the starburst could be due to a minor merger with a gas - rich galaxy .",
    "most likely both processes are present , and the forthcoming work will address the relative importance of each .",
    "one would like to quantify the trends of the specific sfr trends with respect to mass in order to facilitate easier comparison of our optically - selected , local - universe sample to studies at other redshifts , or samples selected in a different manner ( keeping in mind that a conversion may be required for a different choice of imf or @xmath149 ) .",
    "if one can identify `` pure '' star forming galaxies ( with no agn contribution ) using the bpt diagram , then the star forming sequence is best described with a linear fit :    @xmath150    in many instances one does not have all the requisite spectral lines to make an exact classification , but instead relies on color to separate star - forming galaxies . adopting a color cut of @xmath151 , which passes in between the blue and the red sequence , and taking galaxies on the blue side , we encompass all `` pure '' star forming galaxies , but also many sf / agn composites ( see figure [ fig : cmd ] . in that case , the star - forming sequence is better described with a piecewise linear fit :    @xmath152    this relation differs from equation [ eqn : ssfr_mass_sf ] mostly because the high - mass end is somewhat lower  a consequence of including sf / agn composites which have lower specific sfrs than pure sf galaxies of the same mass . in both cases",
    "we have performed least - square fitting to the _ conditional _ volume - corrected composite pdfs ( analogous to the upper panel of figure [ fig : ssfr_mass_cond_all ] ) , binned into running modes in the @xmath153 range for sf galaxies , and @xmath154 range for blue galaxies .",
    "the trend of the specific sfr with respect to mass for the _ entire _ sample is best observed in figure [ fig : ssfr_mass_cond_all ] .",
    "we find that the parametrization having the form similar to @xcite luminosity function provides an excellent overall fit to this trend .",
    "recently , @xcite have used schechter functions to describe the upper _ envelopes _ of their sfr/@xmath155 vs.  @xmath155 data points , but here we find that it represents a good description of the _ main _ trend .",
    "we use the schechter function of the form :    @xmath156 , \\label{eqn : schechter1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath2 describe the normalization , characteristic stellar mass , and the low - mass slope , respectively . taking modes of the conditional distribution in the @xmath159 range , we find the following best - fitting parameters :    @xmath160    this fit , and the data points that were used to construct it are shown in the lower panel of figure [ fig : ssfr_mass_cond_all ] .    in the paradigm of `` downsizing '' , at higher redshifts the sf was more active in galaxies with larger mass .",
    "this should be reflected in the relative flattening of the sf sequence at higher redshifts .",
    "while most current studies observe an overall shift towards higher specific sfrs , the slope does not appear to change much ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our quantification of the specific sfr should enable more direct comparison with the local universe .",
    "in many cases , simple overplotting of equations [ eqn : schechter1 ] and [ eqn : schechter2 ] to other sets of data would be indicative ( unless data are color - selected to include only the blue sequence , in which case we recommend using equation [ eqn : ssfr_mass_blue ] ) .",
    "one often wishes to determine the average specific sfr of their sample .",
    "the average specific sfr can be defined in several ways , but the most used definition is one in which the total sfr in a volume - limited sample is simply divided by the total stellar mass .",
    "we call this the _ cosmic _ specific sfr :    @xmath161    where @xmath162 is the sfr corrected to @xmath3 ( see  [ sec : sfrd ] ) . from our sample",
    "we find @xmath163 , which is in very good agreement with the equivalent measure in b04 .",
    "how much is the estimate of the cosmic specific sfr dependent on the limiting mass of the sample ?",
    "in figure [ fig : ave_ssfr ] we plot cosmic specific sfr as it would have been determined had we had a mass limit ( and assuming the same magnitude limits ) .",
    "right - hand @xmath164-axis shows a fraction of the `` actual '' ( no mass limit ) cosmic @xmath165 at the given mass limit .    finally , we ask with what precision can one use the relations to `` predict '' specific sfr from stellar mass ? for blue galaxies , we find the average scatter around the mean sequence to be 0.5 dex .",
    "this result is only slightly affected after taking out in quadrature the formal measurement error of 0.2 dex .",
    "therefore , the sequence has an intrinsic width , and is likely to depend on other factors besides the mass .",
    "the width itself is a function of mass .",
    "it declines at the rate of @xmath166 dex@xmath53 , i.e. , the scatter of the specific sfr at @xmath167 is 65% larger than at @xmath168 .",
    "this is an indication that the star formation becomes less stochastic as the mass increases , which is what one expects considering that massive galaxies have a larger number of star - forming regions than dwarf galaxies .",
    "in this section we use our sfrs to determine the global star formation density at @xmath3 , the mean redshift of our sample . in order to take into account",
    "that the sample has a spread of redshifts , and therefore probes a range of cosmic star formation history , in the remainder of the section each galaxy s sfr estimate is `` corrected '' to the mean redshift of the survey , where the uncertainties in the correction are minimized . to make the correction , one assumes a cosmic star formation density evolution of the form @xmath169 , where b04 take @xmath170 .",

    "these corrections are 1.62.8% , depending on the class",

    "our sfr density for the sf class is 38% higher ; however , for all other classes the estimate is lower ",
    "between 10% less for agn to 5.7 times less for galaxies without h@xmath2 .",

    "consequently , the contribution of each class to the total sfr density has changed as well .",
    "sf class now contributes some 70% , while it was around 50% in b04 .",
    "this comes at the expense of other classes ( except for the agn ) , and most significantly from much lower contribution of galaxies without h@xmath2  ( 2% , vs.  11% in b04 ) .",
    "we next describe the calculation of our sfr density , which somewhat differs from b04 .",
    "direct summation that was used to find sfr density in b04 assumes that the losses from the incompleteness of the sample are insignificant .",
    "b04 estimates them to be between 1 and 2 percent .",
    "we fit a schechter fit to the number density of galaxies of various classes and integrate the luminosity density down to our completeness limit of @xmath125 , and to a limit which is 10 magnitudes fainter .",

    "up to 1% occurs in galaxies that are quiescent based on the optical spectroscopy .",
    "the uncertainty in the evolution exponent leads to the systematic uncertainty in the total sfr density of 2% . by far",
    "the largest uncertainty stems from the systematic uncertainties in the determination of the dust attenuation , and hence the sfr of sf galaxies (  [ ssec : comp_sf ] ) .",
    "we estimate the degree of this error by simply replacing the sfrs of sf galaxies by those obtained by b04 .",

    "the blue edge is more abrupt then the red side , which shows a tail extending to red - sequence colors , in part due to the intrinsic dust reddening .",
    "we have previously used an @xmath151 cut , which goes across the green valley , to conveniently divide the blue and the red sequences . from figure",

    "uv to optical color is easy to measure , but gives only a very rough idea of a galaxy s sf history .",
    "therefore , in figure [ fig : sfrd_ssfr ] we plot the sf density distribution against the specific sfr .",
    "the picture is somewhat different than from the distribution against the color .",
    "first , the high specific - sfr end does not fall as evenly as did the blue @xmath47 color end ; instead , we see an excess of galaxies with @xmath184 .",
    "these are the bursty , low - mass galaxies mentioned in  [ ssec : ssfr_sf ] .",
    "the reason that @xmath47 color does not distinguish this population is because it `` saturates '' for galaxies with @xmath185 , so that all galaxies with higher specific sfr will have similar @xmath47 colors .",
    "fuv ( included in the specific sfr ) is needed to break the degeneracy .",
    "on the side of the low specific sfr ( equivalent to redder @xmath47 colors ) , the decline is more steep than for the colors .",
    "the difference arises from the fact that the specific sfr , unlike @xmath47 color , does take out the effects of the intrinsic dust attenuation .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig : sfrd_mass ] we show the distribution of sfr density across the galaxies with different stellar masses .",
    "the fraction of sf occurring in galaxies with increasing mass rises almost linearly .",
    "the peak of the sf today occurs in galaxies having a mass of @xmath186 .",

    ", we would expect this distribution to move towards the higher masses at higher redshifts .",
    "this , however , is often difficult to establish since the completeness limits of many high - redshift surveys are uncomfortably close to the peak of the distribution whose position one tries to establish . in figure",
    "[ fig : csfrd_mass ] we show the cumulative sfr density as a function of stellar mass , summing up from the _ highest _ mass galaxies .",
    "this figure shows how much sf is missed ( in the local universe ) by being limited to a given stellar mass ( and assuming the same magnitude limits ) .",
    "thus , a limit of @xmath187 captures only 6% of the total sfr density . in order to reach 50%",
    ", one needs to probe galaxies more massive than @xmath188 . today , 1/2 of the total sfr density comes from galaxies in the mass range @xmath189 .",
    "we have considered the measurement of the star formation rate using a sample of 50,000 optically selected galaxies with _ galex _  and sdss photometry and sdss redshifts .",
    "we have given a detailed description of our approach to sed fitting , including the use of a large library of population models that include a physically motivated treatment of dust attenuation .",
    "these give dust - corrected sfrs ( `` uv '' sfrs ) of galaxies in the local universe . we show that there are no inherent problems that would prevent uv from serving as a reliable sfr indicator , despite past concerns over population synthesis and dust attenuation models .",
    "we recite some of the highlights from our study .    *",
    "25 min imaging from _ galex _  in two uv bands can be used to derive sfrs with a formal accuracy of 0.2 dex for @xmath190 mag star - forming galaxies with known redshifts . * for galaxies for which the dominant ionizing source are young stars , (",
    "as determined using @xmath48 fiber measurements and the bpt diagram ) the sfrs obtained through sed fitting ( `` uv '' sfrs ) agree exceptionally well with dust - corrected sfrs obtained from modeling of the nebular lines ",
    "essentially h@xmath2 , corrected using a balmer decrement ( `` h@xmath2 '' sfrs ) , as long as the same dust model is applied to both methods .",
    "the comparison presented here is at a scale that is two to three orders of magnitude larger than the comparison of these sf indicators done in the past .",
    "* the @xcite dust attenuation model that we apply to `` uv '' sfrs and that @xcite apply to `` h@xmath2 '' sfrs succeeds in producing uv and h@xmath2  dust attenuation estimates that lead to compatible sfrs . * minor differences between the `` uv '' and",
    "`` h@xmath2 '' sfrs exist at the extremes of galaxy stellar mass distributions ( equivalent to the extremes of the dust attenuations ) .",
    "they arise either from somewhat weaker constraints from the sed - derived dust attenuation , or from the mass - dependent deviations of the assumed @xmath109 extinction law in the uv regime . *",
    "if the systematics in the attenuation estimates are accounted for , the `` uv '' and `` h@xmath2 '' sfrs agree within 10% across the entire range of galaxy masses . *",
    "we calibrate the relations that allow sfrs to be determined directly from k - corrected @xmath14 and @xmath15 magnitudes .",
    "they involve an fuv attenuation estimate from the uv color ( equivalent to the uv slope ) that we calibrated for normal star - forming galaxies , and find it to be less steep than the @xcite relation . to obtain sfrs",
    "we find that one requires a conversion factor between the fuv luminosity and sfr that is 30% lower than @xcite value .",
    "such `` simple '' uv sfrs compare well with those obtained from the full sed fitting in the 0.110 @xmath191 range , i.e. , for normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "* for some 50% of the optically selected galaxies from sdss , the emission lines are either too weak ( red sequence galaxies ) , or they are contaminated by narrow - line agn , which precludes obtaining sfrs from h@xmath2  directly . in those cases",
    "@xcite use calibrations between sfr and optical colors from sf galaxies , and apply them to other classes of galaxies .",
    "we find that such calibrations are not reliable and lead to large overestimation of sfrs .",
    "uv , on the other hand , provides more secure sfr estimates .",
    "* we present stellar - mass dependent star formation histories for various classes of optically selected sdss galaxies , from the starbursting dwarf galaxies with specific sfrs ( sfr/@xmath155 ) of @xmath192 to essentially dead , red - sequence galaxies with 6 orders of magnitude lower specific sfr .",
    "we also present a volume - corrected version of these relationships which give a better account of the sf at low masses .",
    "we quantify these relations in order to facilitate comparison with similar results obtained at higher redshifts",
    ". * star forming galaxies with no agn form a very well defined linear star - forming sequence in specific sfr vs.  mass plot , with the intrinsic @xmath193 width of 0.5 dex in log  sfr/@xmath155 .",
    "the sequence is 65% wider at the low mass end ( @xmath194 ) than at high masses , consistent with a more stochastic ( bursty ) sf history for gas - rich dwarfs .",
    "the star - forming sequence terminates at @xmath195 .",
    "* galaxies whose ionizing flux ( as measured in @xmath48 fiber ) comes primarily from young stars ( star formation ) , those for which there is a narrow - line agn component ( mostly seyfert 2s and liners ) , and those which are spectroscopically quiescent ( no detection of h@xmath2  lines ) , all occupy distinct positions in the specific sfr vs.  stellar mass diagram , with the agn hosts lying in between sf galaxies with no agn , and the quiescent galaxies .",
    "star forming galaxies with no agn _ do not _ occupy the intermediate regions of the specific sfr  those are occupied exclusively by galaxies with agn .",
    "* if we take all galaxies forming the agn branch in the bpt diagram ( again from fiber measurements ) and divide them by their agn strength ( as indicated by [ oiii]@xmath405007  luminosity ) , we find that strong agn represent the massive _ continuation _ of the sf sequence defined by galaxies with no agn . strong agn have similar sfrs as the most massive galaxies with no sf , but are more massive , driving their specific sfrs to intermediate values .",
    "weak agn have similar masses as strong agn , but fall at lower star formation rates relative to strong agn , with a tail toward very low star formation rates that extends well into the domain of the optically red galaxies with no h@xmath2 .",
    "while agn appear to be a massive continuation of the blue , star - forming sequence , their optical colors would place most of them onto the _ red _ sequence .",
    "we suggest an evolutionary sequence from massive star forming to quiescent galaxies via strong and weak agn that bridge them .",
    "this scenario supports a picture of agn feedback suppressing star formation in galaxies situated in very massive dark matter halos , the so - called radio mode agn @xcite .",
    "further study is needed . * while mostly inactive , some galaxies with no detectable h@xmath2  in their fiber measurements exhibit sfrs as high as @xmath196 .",
    "the optical colors of these galaxies are predominantly red .",
    "we find that many ( 1/4 ) of such galaxies display disturbed light profiles , sometimes in the form of fading spiral arms with no current sf detectable in h@xmath2 . in many cases we see ring - like structures .",
    "some of these are likely post - starburst systems .",
    "we find that up to 1% of uv sfr density comes from galaxies with no h@xmath2  lines .",
    "* we determine total sfr density in the local universe ( @xmath3 ) of @xmath197 ( for chabrier imf ) , which is in good agreement with most recent estimates , yet has a smaller error ( which includes random and most systematic errors ) . *",
    "large fraction ( 95% ) of sf takes place in blue sequence galaxies ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "sfr density increases in galaxies of increasing mass , and peaks in galaxies with masses @xmath199close to the `` transition '' mass of @xcite ( i.e. , the mass at which the mass functions of red ( old ) and blue galaxies intersect ) .",
    "galaxies in the mass range @xmath189 account for 1/2 of the total sfr density .",
    "we demonstrate the ability of _ galex _  uv observations of the galaxies in the local universe to constrain sfrs of a statistically large number of galaxies with a wide dynamic range of sf activity .",
    "besides characterizing the galaxies in the local universe , this study provides a better reference point for high - redshift investigations .",
    "this and the forthcoming studies based on _ galex _  will continue to provide a better understanding of the galaxy evolution , specifically the origin of the galaxy bimodality , the inter - connection between the sf and agn activity , and the general star formation history of galaxies spanning a range from gas - rich dwarfs to massive ellipticals .    we thank janice c.  lee for insightful comments and helpful discussions .",
