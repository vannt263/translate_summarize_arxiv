    "be / x - ray binaries are the most common type of accreting x - ray pulsar systems observed .",

    "* for a review . )",
    "the line emission is believed to be associated with circumstellar material shed by the be star into its equatorial plane .",
    "the exact nature of the mass loss process is unknown , but it is thought to be related to the rapid rotation of the be star , typically near 70% of the critical break - up velocity @xcite .",

    "x - ray outbursts are produced when the pulsar interacts with the be star s disk .",
    "be / x - ray binaries typically show two types of outburst behavior : ( a ) giant outbursts ( or type ii ) , characterized by high luminosities and high spin - up rates ( i.e. , a significant increase in pulse frequency ) and ( b ) normal outbursts ( or type i ) , characterized by lower luminosities , low spin - up rates ( if any ) , and repeated occurrence at the orbital period @xcite . as a population",
    "be / x - ray binaries show a correlation between their spin and orbital periods @xcite .    for isolated be stars , variations in the infrared bands ( j , h , k ) are believed to be good indicators of the size of the be star s disk .",
    "however , when the be star is in a binary system with a neutron star , the be disk is truncated at a resonance radius by tidal forces from the orbit of the neutron star @xcite . in these systems , since the disk can not easily change size because of the truncation radius , changes in mass loss from the be star produce changes in the disk density , which can even become optically thick at infrared wavelengths ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the pulsar continued with faint x - ray outbursts and a global spin down trend until 2002 , when again the k - band intensity increased to the 1992 - 1994 level followed by brighter x - ray outbursts and a transition to global spin - up @xcite .",

    "the outburst peaks had finally returned to approximately six days after periastron .",
    "after the giant outburst , the first normal outburst peaked at about 14 days after periastron as did the third and brightest of the normal outbursts .",
    "the remaining five normal outbursts peaked about 11 days after periastron .",
    "it is interesting to note that both sudden shifts in outburst phase are similar in magnitude , about 8 - 9 days , but opposite in sign .",
    "figure  [ fig : giantphase ] shows a comparison between the giant outburst and the average profiles of normal outbursts before and after it . the giant outburst and the small normal outburst that preceded it",
    "are denoted by black asterisks .",
    "the normal outburst preceding the giant outburst was not particularly bright , occurred at the same orbital phase as the average profile for the preceding eight outbursts ( green diamonds ) , but was unusual in that at about the point the outburst should have started fading , the flux remained higher than expected and then quickly rose into the giant outburst .",
    "arrows on the plot denote orbital phase 0.75 , where the giant outburst appears to be starting to rise rapidly , and where we see a rapid increase in flux one orbit later .",
    "the average profile from the first four outbursts following the giant outburst ( red triangles ) shows that those outbursts began later in orbital phase and had a higher intra - outburst flux than the pre - giant outbursts and the later post - giant outbursts ( blue squares ) . from figures  [ fig : giantphase ] and [ fig :",
    "ltflx ] , the intra - outburst flux is slowly fading .",
    "it appears to be a long - lived tail of the giant outburst .",
    "a long - lived tail of a giant outburst has not been observed before in be / x - ray binaries .    from our orbital fits using 17 years of exo 2030 + 375 data , we see marginal evidence for apsidal precession .",
    "our measurements are consistent with predictions from simple calculations given below . in the supernova explosions that form",
    "be x - ray binaries the neutron star will receive a kick out of the original orbital plane . if the orbit is misaligned with the companion s spin axis , precession of the orbital plane is expected . using calculations described in @xcite",
    "we estimate the magnitude of the expected effect due to interactions between the companion s rotation period and the orbit .",
    "the apsidal motion and orbital plane precession change @xmath18 the observed longitude of periastron and @xmath93 the orbital inclination angle . using equation  7 in @xcite to calculate the apsidal rate @xmath22 gives @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the apsidal motion constant for a @xmath96 main - sequence star @xcite ; @xmath97 is the assumed be star radius ; @xmath98 is the dimensionless spin of the companion , assumed to be near break - up @xmath99 ; @xmath100 is the measured semi - major - axis ; @xmath25 is the measured orbital period ( see table  [ tab : orb ] ) ; @xmath93 is the orbital inclination angle ; and @xmath101 is the angle between the orbital angular momentum and the spin angular momentum .    from our orbital fits , we measured apsidal rates ranging from @xmath102 radians yr@xmath53 ( fit 3 , table  [ tab : orb ] ) to @xmath103 radians yr@xmath53 ( fit 2 , table  [ tab : orb ] ) .",
    "our measurements are within a factor of about 2 of the simple calculations , suggesting that we are seeing apsidal motion in this system .",
    "the change in @xmath93 is given by equation  8 in @xcite and has the same magnitude as @xmath22 @xmath104 in fits 2 and 3 , we see a suggestion of a change in @xmath93 , @xmath105 radians yr@xmath53 , also consistent with the calculation within a factor of about two",
    ".      in the discovery outburst observed with exosat in 1985 , the maximum observed luminosity in the 1 - 20 kev band was @xmath106 erg @xmath55 s@xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the maximum 2 - 20 kev luminosity observed with rxte pca was @xmath107 erg @xmath55 s@xmath53 , about 72% of the exosat value .",
    "both luminosities assume a distance of 7.1 kpc @xcite .",
    "the difference can not be explained from absorption , suggesting that the 1985 outburst was brighter .",
    "further evidence for this comes from comparing the peak spin - up rates from both outbursts .",
    "the peak spin - up rate measured in the 1985 outburst was @xmath108 hz s@xmath53 , while the peak spin - up rate measured in the 2006 outburst was @xmath52 hz s@xmath53 , also about 75% of the exosat value .",
    "however , despite the fainter peak , the 2 - 20 flux minimum reached after the 2006 outburst was @xmath109 erg @xmath55 s@xmath53 much brighter than the 1985 upper limit of @xmath110 erg @xmath55 s@xmath53 ( 1 - 20 kev ) .",
    "the 2006 flux minimum occurred about 90 days after the peak and similarly the 1985 upper limit was measured 98 days after the initial and brightest detection . presumably , the _ exosat  _ detections of exo 2030 + 375 from 1985 october",
    "29 - november 3 @xcite corresponded to a normal outburst . using our best ephemeris , we find that these observations span orbital phases of 8.5 to 13.5 days past periastron , very similar to the orbital phases where we see normal outbursts after the 2006 giant outburst .",
    "the first normal outburst after the 2006 giant outburst reached a peak 2 - 20 kev flux of about @xmath111 erg @xmath55 s@xmath53 , approximately a factor of two brighter than the non - flaring observation on 1985 november 3 and a factor of about 3 fainter than the brightest flares on 1985 october 30 - 31 @xcite . from figure",
    "[ fig : postgiantres ] it is clear that considerable day to day variability was present especially in the first outburst after the 2006 giant outburst and between outbursts .",
    "this variability may be related to the flaring seen on 1985 october 30 - 31 .",
    "both flaring episodes occurred at similar orbital phases ; however , our _ rxte  _ observations were too short to confirm if the same flaring behavior was occurring .",
    "exo 2030 + 375 has now been observed for more than 22 years . in this time",
    ", it underwent two giant outbursts , in 1985 and 2006 , and numerous normal outbursts .",
    "weak evidence for evolution of the binary orbit is presented in this paper . perhaps by the next giant outburst this can be accurately determined . in 2006",
    ", we observed the onset of a giant outburst of exo 2030 + 375 for the first time . a normal outburst , which peaked slightly later than the previous ones , preceded the 2006 giant outburst .",
    "near orbital phase 0.5 ( see figure  [ fig : giantphase ] ) the flux from exo 2030 + 375 began to increase instead of declining as it usually would after a normal outburst .",
    "the flux and spin - up rate continued to increase for more than an entire orbit .",
    "near orbital phase 0.75 , the flux abruptly increased , accompanied by an abrupt increase in the spin - up rate .",
    "this was followed by a relatively flat - topped maximum during which the flux remained within 10% of the maximum for about 25 days , from orbital phase 0.2 to 0.35 . after that",
    ", the flux declined to a minimum more than 1.5 orbits later .",
    "the entire giant outburst spanned more than three pulsar orbits .    during the 2006 giant outburst",
    ", we discovered evidence for a cyclotron feature with a mean value of @xmath112 kev that was consistently detected for about 90 days , at 2 - 100 kev luminosities above @xmath113 erg s@xmath53 .",
    "this feature translates into a magnetic field strength of @xmath114 g @xmath115 g. predictions of the peak spin - up rate during the giant outburst , using this magnetic field strength , are consistent with the measured peak spin - up rate during the 2006 giant outburst .",
    "@xcite proposed that the exo 2030 + 375 spectrum measured with _",
    "integral  _ and _ swift  _ could also be explained by a model containing a bump at 15 kev .",
    "however , our _ rxte  _ observations do not appear to support that model .",
    "the cyclotron features for exo 2030 + 375 and 4u 0115 + 63 @xcite have the lowest energies measured to date .",
    "now we are left with the question : is the lack of detections of @xmath116 kev a physical or observational bias ?",
    "the two classes , normal ( type i ) and giant ( type ii ) , of be / x - ray pulsar outbursts are clearly distinguishable in the observations of exo 2030 + 375 .",
    "however , the evolution seen in the phasing , duration , and peak flux of the normal outbursts , while apparently related to the be star s",
    "disk @xcite , is poorly understood .",
    "the lack of gaps in detection between the normal outbursts after the 2006 giant outburst implies that the accretion disk present in the giant outburst persists throughout these normal outbursts .",
    "many have believed that the giant outbursts and normal outbursts were distinguished by the presence of an accretion disk in the giant outburst , while the normal outbursts proceeded by wind accretion .",
    "possibly the normal outbursts following a giant outburst are a distinct class of normal outbursts , with the remainder proceeding by wind accretion . however , xte j1946 + 274 @xcite had a series of normal outbursts that also had no detection gaps between them , but these outbursts were not preceded by a giant outburst .",
    "@xcite show for longer period sources , e.g. a0535 + 26 , disk accretion is required for the normal outbursts to occur .",
    "@xcite conclude from simulations that a transient disk forms in normal outbursts in shorter period systems , e.g. 4u0115 + 63 .",
    "measurements of significant spin - up during normal outbursts of exo 2030 + 375 prior to the 2006 giant outburst @xcite suggested that at least a transient accretion disk was also present in those outbursts .",
    "further , @xcite conclude from simulations that accretion disks in be / x - ray binaries evolve through three phases : a ` developing phase ' where the mass accretion rate is double - peaked , but dominated by direct accretion at periastron ; a transition phase where the mass accretion rate evolves from double - peaked to single peaked as the approximately keplerian disk grows with time ; and finally a quasi - steady state where the mass accretion rate has a single peak induced by a one - armed spiral wave and is on average balanced with the mass - transfer rate from the be disk .",
    "@xcite reported multiple detections of an initial spike preceding the main peak in outbursts prior to the giant outburst .",
    "this initial spike was usually smaller than the main outburst peak , suggesting that exo 2030 + 375 was in the ` transition phase . ' after the giant outburst , the initial spike preceding the main peak has disappeared from the normal outbursts , suggesting that the accretion disk in exo 2030 + 375 has reached the final quasi - steady state .",
    "therefore , the long - term behavior seen in the normal outbursts of exo 2030 + 375 appears to be product of the state of the be disk and the accretion disk , allowing for a wide range of variations .",
    "giant outbursts from exo 2030 + 375 also vary in brightness and in orbital phase .",
    "the 2006 giant outburst peaked at a 2 - 100 kev luminosity of @xmath117 erg s@xmath53 .",
    "in the 2006 giant outburst , the 2 - 20 kev luminosity and the peak spin - up rate were about 72% and 75% , respectively , of that measured in the the 1985 outburst , suggesting that the 1985 outburst had a 2 - 100 kev peak luminosity of @xmath118 erg s@xmath53 , which was super - eddington unless the neutron star mass was greater than about @xmath119 .",
    "the 1985 outburst was shifted by 0.65 in orbital phase relative to the decline of the 2006 outburst .",
    "interestingly , the decay constants of both outbursts were very similar .",
    "giant outbursts in exo 2030 + 375 do not appear to be locked in orbital phase , unless the onsets are .",
    "the 2006 minimum spanned orbital phase 0.2 to 0.1 , very similar to the orbital phase of the 23 august 1985 minimum ; however , the 2006 minimum was more than 30 times brighter than in 1985 . despite the differences between the giant outbursts , the normal outburst following the 1985 giant outburst lined up quite well in orbital phase with the second normal outburst following the 2006 giant outburst .",
    "both normal outbursts also showed flaring activity .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) , provided by nasa s goddard space flight center ( gsfc ) .",
