    "fast radio bursts ( frbs ) are bright millisecond flashes mostly found at high galactic latitudes @xcite .",
    "since discovery , they have received a large amount of theoretical study on possible progenitors , burst mechanisms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and potential usage to probe the intergalactic medium ( igm , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and cosmology @xcite . the strongest argument for their cosmological origin is that the large dispersion measures ( dms ) , the line - of - sight electron column density @xmath8 , are inconsistent with being from the average interstellar medium ( ism ) , stellar corona , hii regions and supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the galaxy ( or even the local group , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that frb 121102 has been observed to repeat @xcite rules out catastrophic events at least for this burst .",
    "frb models are mostly based on neutron stars ( nss ) , which could naturally accommodate the short durations @xmath9 , bright coherent emission , repetitivity on a range of intervals ( @xmath10 to @xmath11 or longer , depending on the flux level ) .",
    "in addition , many frbs show pulse widths of @xmath12 consistent with multi - path propagation spreading and are much longer than what intergalactic or galactic scattering could account for @xcite .",
    "this means the local plasma surrounding the progenitors must be more strongly scattering than the average ism .",
    "the rotation measure given by the linearly polarized frb 110523 is much larger than intergalactic or galactic contributions , meaning the progenitor is located in a dense magnetized nebula @xcite .",
    "the dm from a snr decreases with time , but the repeating frb 121102 has a constant @xmath13 for 3 yrs .",
    "this means a possible ns must be older than @xmath14 and the dm from the snr is smaller than @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "therefore , frbs are likely from nss of 100 yr to 1 myr old embedded in snrs or star - forming regions .    due to insufficient monitoring time , the other ( so - far ) `` non - repeating '' frbs could also be repeating . in this _ letter _ , we assume that frbs are from nss at cosmological distances and that they repeat with a universal energy distribution function ( edf ) .",
    "below , we first summarize the properties of frb 121102 in section [ sec:121102 ] , and then explore the answers to the following questions : ( i ) _ do frb statistics so far support a universal edf ?",
    "if so , what constraints can we put on it ? _",

    "the fluence distribution function of frb 121102 is a power - law @xmath37 @xcite , so @xmath38 should mainly come from the most energetic bursts ( which we missed due to insufficient monitoring time ) , and this is why eq.([eq:3 ] ) is a lower limit .",

    "derive a completeness threshold of @xmath84 for the parkes frbs .",
    "therefore , we test our model only on parkes frbs with @xmath85 , which converts to a sample of 8 bursts @xcite",
    ".    some other factors could introduce biases : ( i ) scattering by the galactic ism may bias against detection of frbs at low galactic latitudes @xcite ; ( ii ) in de - dispersion trials , typically , dms of @xmath86 and @xmath87 are not considered , resulting in effectively a low- ( @xmath88 ) and high - redshift ( @xmath89 ) blindness ; ( iii ) the source position within a single beam ( @xmath90 ) is unknown and most authors use the on - axis assumption and report a lower limit .",
    "due to ( i ) , we have discarded frbs that occurred below galactic latitude @xmath91 .",
    "it turns out ( ii ) does not introduce significant biases because the observed frb are all between @xmath92 and the true rate should cut off sharply below and above this range .",
    "based on ( iii ) , we also try the sample selected by @xmath93 ( with 11 frbs ) for comparison .      in fig.([fig : comp ] ) , we compare the theoretical event rate above threshold @xmath94 with observations , for three different power - law slopes ( @xmath95 ) and various energy cutoffs ( @xmath58 from 10 to @xmath96 ) .",
    "we can see that , for a larger @xmath57 and smaller @xmath72 , more frbs are expected to have small @xmath97 .",
    "we quantify the goodness of the fit by calculating the reduced @xmath73 , as shown in fig.([fig : chisq ] ) .",
    "the upper panel is for @xmath94 ( 8 bursts ) and the lower for @xmath98 ( 11 bursts ) .",

    "we also mark the power - law index for frb 121102 @xmath102 , with 1- and 2-@xmath103 errors between dashed and dotted lines .",
    "the agreement with the constraints from the whole sample means that frbs may indeed share a universal edf .",
    "frb 121102 may be representative in that its power - law index lies within the range allowed by the statistics from the whole population .",
    "as for the normalization , we draw in fig.([fig : ndet ] ) the contours of @xmath104\\ ] ] for the two samples with @xmath105 ( upper ) and @xmath106 ( lower panel ) . dashed curves are for negative values . for the parameter space allowed by parkes data ( red contours , eq . [ eq:16 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath107 .",
    "the observational all - sky frb rate above @xmath108 is estimated to be @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "considering all the uncertainties , we obtain @xmath110 however , the normalization parameter @xmath5 is still unconstrained so far and will be discussed in next section .",
    "@xcite conducted a follow - up survey of the fields of 8 known frbs as in section [ sec : obs ] ( only 3 of them overlap ) . ] and found none repeating .",
    "other follow - up surveys , e.g. @xcite , are less constraining . for a given burst @xmath111 at redshift @xmath112 ,",
    "the average number of repeating events above the threshold @xmath62 within a monitoring time @xmath113 is @xmath114.\\ ] ] the probability of observing none of the 8 repeating is @xmath115 we take the monitoring time @xmath116 from @xcite and assume that the survey is sensitive to any repeating bursts above the threshold @xmath94 .",
    "we calculate @xmath117 as a function of @xmath57 and @xmath72 from eq.([eq:18 ] ) and ( [ eq:19 ] ) and show the result in fig.([fig : p0rep ] ) for @xmath118 ( upper ) and @xmath119 ( lower pannel ) .",
    "we find that , if all frbs repeat at the same rate as frb 121102 ( @xmath120 ) , the probability of observing none repeating is @xmath121  @xmath122 .",
    "this , again , supports frb 121102 as being representative of the whole population .",
    "note that @xcite used a relatively short cutoff of de - dispersed width @xmath123 , which could lead to incompleteness above @xmath84 and further increases @xmath117 .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite detected a new frb at redshift @xmath124 in the survey .",
    "the average number of bnss at redshift @xmath125 in a sky area of @xmath126 is @xmath127 the probability of having at least one bns with @xmath128 in the observed area is @xmath129 the product @xmath78 is constrained by eq.([eq:17 ] ) , so we have @xmath130 if every frb repeats similarly as frb 121102 ( @xmath131 ) , the probability of having @xmath132 frbs at @xmath128 in a 4 @xmath133 area is @xmath134 , with lower @xmath5 giving larger @xmath135 .    putting @xmath117 and @xmath135 together ,",
    "we find the observations by @xcite favor a normalization constant @xmath5 smaller than the value of frb 121102 , but @xmath120 is not ruled out at a high confidence . a relatively steep power - law with @xmath136",
    "is also favored , as can be seen in fig.([fig : p0rep ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that frb 121102 may be slightly more active than average ( with a relatively large @xmath5 ) but is so far consistent with being representative of the ensemble .",
    "this _ letter _ is based on three hypotheses : ( i ) frbs are produced by nss at cosmological distances with their dms mostly due to free electrons in the igm ; ( ii ) frb rate tracks core - collapse supernova rate ; ( iii ) frbs repeat with a universal edf @xmath137 with a high - end cutoff at @xmath1 . based on these assumptions , we find that observations so far are consistent with a universal edf with power - law index @xmath2 , high - end cutoff @xmath138 and normalization @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is defined as the integrated rate above @xmath139 ( @xmath7 being the radio emission efficiency ) .",
    "we also put constraints on the dimensionless product @xmath140 , where @xmath41 is the fraction of nss that are able to produce observable frbs and @xmath42 is the length of the bursting phase .",
    "better statistics in the future could narrow down the uncertainties , if our hypotheses are correct .",
    "some of the implications of our results on the frb progenitors are as follows :    * the edf of frbs is shallower than the power - law tail of crab giant pulses ( @xmath141 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and consistent with magnetar bursts ( @xmath142 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and other avalanche events explained by self - organized criticality @xcite . * burst energy can reach @xmath143 , which is supported by the `` lorimer '' burst with @xmath144 @xcite . *",
    "the spacial density of frb progenitors is @xmath145 where we have used @xmath146 to get the numerical values .",
    "although @xmath5 still has large uncertainties , the fact the frb 121102 is consistent with being representative means that @xmath5 is likely not much smaller than @xmath147 .",
    "if we want to use bnss to probe the density fluctuations of igm @xcite , the spacial resolution may be @xmath148 .",
    "* the fraction of nss that are able to produce observable frbs is @xmath149 . if we consider the possibility that @xmath150 , the fraction could be as low as @xmath151 !",
    "although the true fraction is a factor of @xmath152 higher ( @xmath35 is the total sky coverage of all bursts from one progenitor ) , frb progenitors may be a rare type of nss .",
    "for example , the birth rate of magnetars is @xmath153 of core - collapse rate @xcite , so `` being a magnetar '' may not be sufficient for frbs .",
