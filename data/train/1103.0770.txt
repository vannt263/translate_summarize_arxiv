    "passage of charged particles through a bent crystal , even in a planar orientation , is a complex phenomenon , theoretical treatment of which used to rely on computer simulation .",
    "however , sometimes complexity begets simplicity , which may permit analytic advances  like it was commonly practiced before the advent of computers .",
    "actually , computer and analytic calculations complement one another : analytic formulas provide general understanding of the phenomenon , and may serve for experiment planning , while computer can offer precise predictions for an established experimental setting .",
    "an example of a problem where analytic approach did bring fruit is fast charged particle passage through a planarly oriented uniformly bent crystal . even though the planar orientation and uniformity of the bending enormously simplify the dynamics , reducing it to radial 1d , yet there are impediments for solution of the whole beam - crystal interaction problem : how to analytically describe particle passage through many inter - planar intervals , and how to analytically average over the initial particle impact parameters .",
    "alleviation came from the use of a simplified ( parabolic ) model for inter - planar continuous potential , which made analytic solution for single volume reflection ( vr ) feasible @xcite .",
    "it appears that precise inter - planar potential shape is of minor consequence anyway , and the piecewise harmonic potential model yields fair agreement with the experiment .",
    "a different story is the bremsstrahlung emitted by the fast particle in a bent crystal .",
    "there , a large contribution comes from the dipole coherent bremsstrahlung , which can be described for an arbitrary inter - planar potential .",
    "analytic theory of dipole coherent radiation in bent crystals ( cbbc ) was constructed in @xcite .",
    "the present short note surveys the physical picture of volume reflection and radiation in a bent crystal , in the pure continuous potential .",
    "vr effect manifests itself in the same region of @xmath0 ratio as channeling , with the proviso that the particle entrance angle with respect to active crystallographic planes must be well above critical .",
    "however , the correlation between the particle deflection angle and the crystal curvature for vr appears to be more intricate than that for channeling :    1 .   in vr particles",
    "deflect to the side opposite to that of the crystal bending ; 2 .",
    "the deflection angle tends to a finite limit with the increase of @xmath1 ratio , although @xmath2 corresponds to a straight crystal and no net deflection ; this limiting value is of the order of critical angle @xmath3 both for positive and for negative particles , though with different numerical coefficients .",

    "the qualitative explanation of the opposite deflection direction is given in @xcite :  for a small crystal curvature , that is @xmath9 , the turning points of all particles gather in a narrow region near the inner wall of a planar channel .",
    "the strong electric field of the crystal plane is directed along @xmath10 and at the turning points it imparts to the particle an angular deflection towards the opposite direction with respect to the crystal bending , producing volume reflection . \" for explanation of feature 2 the latter argument is not sufficient yet .",
    "it is known that for negative particles the force in the reflection point is much smaller than for positive ones , but nevertheless , the deflection angle for these cases is of the same order . for a closer look ,",
    "let us draw a graph of the family of particle trajectories in an exemplary inter - planar interval ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vol - vs - edge ] ) .",
    "the figure reveals that in inter - planar channels there emerge regions devoid of particles .",
    "this entails deficit of force of a definite ( positive ) sign acting on the beam as a whole ; hence , the mean deflection angle must be negative . at sufficiently large @xmath10 ,",
    "the void transverse dimension is @xmath11 , so @xmath12 , and the longitudinal dimension is @xmath13 ( the channeling oscillation timescale ) times shorter than scale @xmath14 within which the particle trajectory substantially differs from a straight line . at @xmath15 , in principle one should mind the existence of two longitudinal scales in the volume reflection phenomenon . ] ; none of these parameters involve @xmath10 , therefore , there is a limiting value @xmath16 independent of @xmath10 : @xmath17 .    of course , if one overbends the crystal , all the intra - crystal space becomes uniformly covered by the particle flow , then voids and therewith the vr effect disappear .",
    "in @xcite it was proved that if @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 , then @xmath20 .",
    "_ ex adverso _ the existence of vr effect can be explained more concisely : when a high - energy particle passes through a bent crystal , after its entrance the angle between its velocity and the active planes decreases . when this angle becomes @xmath8 , the particle experiences strong influence of the continuous potential field on the length @xmath21 .",
    "if this length is shorter than @xmath22 , it would be capable of making the particle channeled .",
    "but for motion in a stationary potential , an unbound particle can not pass into bound state .",
    "hence , at @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 , the particle net inclination angle can not become smaller than @xmath3 , which implies that the particle will reflect when the angle becomes @xmath8  see right - side frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : vol - vs - edge ] .",
    "although the term ` volume ' reflection signifies that the deflection arises somewhere in the crystal volume , and therefore should not depend on the crystal boundaries , but to some degree , the boundary effects still manifest themselves when investigating the final beam profile detail .    possible boundary conditions for vr in a uniformly bent crystal .",

    "the particles enter the crystal tangentially to the active planes , so , at @xmath9 most of the particles are channeled , but a small fraction of particles hitting one - sided vicinity of the top of potential barrier belongs to volume reflection . for the latter fraction , it is supposed that owing to symmetry of the trajectory in a central field with respect to the reflection ( minimal - radius ) point , the deflection angle @xmath28 for case a ) is half the value for case b ) .",
    "but yet there is a slight dependence of the deflection angle on the impact parameter , and it is this dependence which determines the final beam shape .",

    "( 31 ) of @xcite , presenting the spectrum through a cubic polynomial function @xmath90 .",
    "averaging over angular distribution in the initial beam and account of multiple scattering in the crystal volume is also feasible analytically .",
    "evaluation of the spectrum of bremsstrahlung produced under a definite force @xmath91 action on a charged particle often proceeds in two steps : ( i ) fourier - decomposition of the external force , i.e. , distinguishing virtual photons absorbed by the particle ; ( ii ) conversion of the force spectrum to the radiation spectrum .",
    "an important physical scale characterizing each stage is its coherence length . in general , real photon emission ( @xmath92 ) and virtual photon absorption ( @xmath93 )",
    "coherence lengths need not be related .",
    "indeed , in simplest cases one has @xmath94 ( stochastic scattering in an amorphous medium ) , or @xmath95 ( uniform external field ) , but @xmath96 always stays finite , providing for those cases the only coherence length to refer to . from the experience of the mentioned simplest cases ,",
    "it had become common to call @xmath92 simply ` coherence length ' , without specification of the nature of the coherence .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the bremsstrahlung problem may be treated in the dipole approximation , the photon emission coherence is strictly related with the virtual photon absorption coherence : it reduces to lorentz - rescaling of the frequency and integration of the intensity over typical @xmath97 emission angles ( cf .",
    "( [ omega0 ] ) below ) .",
    "thence , it suffices to analyze the coherence in the external field fourier decomposition .    in crystals",
    ", @xmath93 acquires a finite size . in a straight crystal , this is just the distance between the planes crossed along the particle path ; the irradiation resonance condition requires @xmath92 to have the same value . then , @xmath98 at that , the typical radiation energy @xmath99 is just the lorentz - rescaled plane - crossing frequency .",
    "the radiation spectral intensity is estimated as ( cf .",
    "( [ decbbc - straight ] ) ) @xmath100    less trivial situation emerges in a bent crystal .",
    "there , the local frequency of plane crossing varies along the crystal , whereby there are 2 spatial scales : @xmath101 on which the integrals from oscillatory gaussians ( @xmath102 ) converge , and the longitudinal geometrical scale of the crystal ( say , its thickness @xmath87 ) determining the limiting frequency of plane crossing .",
    "if a tangency point of the particle trajectory with the family of bent planes occurs within the crystal , then @xmath103    comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eee ] ) and ( [ straight - spectrum ] ) , one sees that in both cases the radiation intensity is proportional to @xmath104 , which is in line with the understanding @xcite of coherence length as the length at which radiation amplitudes add up .",
    "besides that , ( [ straight - spectrum ] ) involves a factor @xmath105 arising due to spectral overlap of radiation generated within the crystal thickness in different coherence intervals ( pile - up factor ) . in a bent crystal , where radiation from different coherence intervals does not overlap , factor @xmath106 enters the expression for the spectrum extent @xmath107 instead of intensity ( [ eee ] ) .",
    "since @xmath93 and @xmath92 appear to be important physical quantities , it is worth estimating their typical values . for @xmath108",
    "m , @xmath109 @xmath110 , eq .  ( [ lefc ] ) gives @xmath111 @xmath112 , whereas ratio @xmath113 is usually small ( see eq .",
    "( [ lefclll ] ) below ) .",
    "therefore , without breaking the picture of cbbc , the crystal thickness may be decreased down to fractions of millimeter .",
    "lastly , concerning the multiple scattering influence on the radiation , it is quantified by parameter @xmath114 , which is larger than lpm parameter @xmath115 , and therefore is more critical .",
    "the observation that representation ( [ a16arut ] ) contains a straight crystal limit may appear surprising from the viewpoint that local cbbc theory is based on the stationary phase approximation , whose condition assumes @xmath116 as @xmath10 , and therewith @xmath93 , increases , condition ( [ lefclll ] ) must break down .",
    "nevertheless , this does not destroy the convergence of the integral , provided @xmath117 i. e. , the particle crosses a large number of inter - planar intervals even in a straight crystal",
    ". if ( [ eqqq17 ] ) holds , with the increase of @xmath10 one sooner arrives at a condition @xmath118 than at ( [ lefclll ] ) .",
    "that implies that variation of the local plane - crossing frequency in the bent crystal is smaller than the frequency mean value , which is equivalent to near straightness of the crystal , regardless of whether condition ( [ lefclll ] ) holds or not .",
    "in @xcite it was demonstrated that under condition ( [ cond ] ) , eqs .",
    "( [ decbbc - dz]-[decbbc - straight ] ) indeed turn to the familiar formula of cbbc in a straight crystal , with the crystal bending radius dropping out .",
    "hence , further increase of the radius will be inconsequential .",
    "linear_-exponent oscillatory integral convergence will be achieved at length ( [ lcoh - straight ] ) within the crystal thickness without the aid of crystal curvature .",
    "together , conditions ( [ lefclll]-[eqqq17 ] ) may be cast into a universal expression for the convergence length : @xmath119      for planar orientation of the crystal , when the particle is mainly subject to the force orthogonal to the active planes , there must be a significant net polarization of the cone of emitted bremsstrahlung , directed orthogonally to the planes . according to @xcite , the polarization degree equals @xmath120 where the azimuthal anisotropy parameter @xmath121 for planar orientation must be close to 1 .",
    "thereat , the maximal value of @xmath122 is 50% at @xmath123 , while at @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
