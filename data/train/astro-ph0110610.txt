    "the spatial distribution , mass function and redshift evolution of clusters of galaxies are sensitive functions of cosmology .",
    "the space density @xmath8 of clusters predicted by analytical models ( press & schechter 1974 ; lacey & cole 1993 ; sheth , mo & tormen 2001 ) and numerical simulations ( navarro , frenk & white 1995 ; eke , cole & frenk 1996 ; jenkins 2000 ; bode 2001 ) can be related to ( more easily ) observable properties such as the x - ray temperatures and luminosities of clusters via simple scaling relations .",
    "assuming that the x - ray gas in clusters is virialized and in hydrostatic equilibrium , the mass , @xmath9 , within radius @xmath10 ( inside which the mean mass density is @xmath11 times the critical density , @xmath12 , at that epoch ) is related to the mean mass - weighted temperature within that radius , @xmath13 , by @xmath14 . here , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the redshift - dependent hubble constant ( bryan & norman 1998 ) .",
    "since the x - rays from rich clusters are primarily bremsstrahlung emission , one can also show that @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the bolometric luminosity from within radius @xmath10 .",
    "the validity of these simple scaling relations is supported by numerical simulations ( evrard , metzler & navarro 1996 ; bryan & norman 1998 ; thomas 2001 ; mathiesen & evrard 2001 ) , although the normalization of the mass - temperature relation exhibits some variation from study to study ( the normalization of bryan & norman 1998 is 17 per cent higher than that of evrard , metzler & navarro 1996 for @xmath19 ; see also table 1 of afshordi & cen 2001 ) .",
    "the normalization of the luminosity - temperature relation is more difficult to predict due to the potentially complex physics of the x - ray gas in the innermost regions of clusters from where the bulk of the x - ray luminosity arises .",
    "recent observational determinations of the mass - temperature relation , based on asca and rosat data for relatively hot ( @xmath20 kev ) clusters ( horner , mushotzky & scharf 1999 ; nevalainen , markevitch & forman 2000 ; finoguenov , reiprich & bhringer 2001 ) have recovered a slope consistent with the simple scaling - law predictions , although the observed normalizations are typically @xmath6 per cent lower than predicted by the simulations of evrard , metzler & navarro ( 1996 ) for a standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) cosmology . for clusters at lower temperatures ,",
    "some steepening of the mass - temperature relation is inferred ( nevalainen 2000 , finoguenov 2001 ) .",
    "studies of the luminosity - temperature relation ( white , jones & forman 1997 ; allen & fabian 1998 ; markevitch 1998 ; arnaud & evrard 1999 ) have generally measured @xmath21 , whereas theory predicts @xmath22 .",
    "this has been taken as evidence for significant pre - heating and/or cooling in cluster cores ( kaiser 1991 ; evrard & henry 1991 ; cavaliere , menci & tozzi 1997 ; pearce 2000 ; bialek , evrard & mohr 2001 ) .",
    "allen & fabian ( 1998 ) have shown that for hot ( @xmath23 kev ) , relaxed clusters @xmath24 is recovered once the effects of cool , central components are accounted for in the spectral x - ray analysis , suggesting ( in agreement with the later mass - temperature results ) that pre - heating may only significantly affect the properties of cooler , less - luminous clusters .    a major goal of studies with the new generation of x - ray missions including the chandra observatory and xmm - newton , which permit the first direct spatially - resolved x - ray spectroscopy of hot , distant clusters , is the verification and accurate calibration of the virial relations for galaxy clusters . in particular , detailed studies of systems for which precise mass measurements have been made using other , independent methods are required . an early attempt at combining x - ray and gravitational lensing data for clusters observed with the asca satellite to study the mass - temperature relation was presented by hjorth , oukbir & van kampen ( 1998 ) .",
    "in this letter we use new chandra observations to determine the x - ray virial relations for a sample of luminous , relatively relaxed clusters spanning the redshift range @xmath25 , for which lensing mass measurements are available and have been shown to be in good agreement with the chandra results ( section 2 ; see allen 1998 , bhringer 1998 for earlier results ) .",
    "we present gas mass - weighted temperatures , bolometric luminosities and total mass measurements within radii corresponding to a fixed overdensity @xmath0 at the redshifts of the clusters , and compare the observed scaling relations between these quantities with those predicted by simulations .",
    "results are given for two cosmologies : scdm with @xmath26@xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and @xmath7cdm with @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "we conclude that the slope of the temperature - luminosity relation for the present sample of hot , relaxed clusters is consistent with the predicted value of @xmath76 ( section 1 ) .",
    "fixing @xmath77 results in a poor fit : @xmath78 for 5 degrees of freedom , as opposed to @xmath79 with @xmath76 ( @xmath7cdm ) .",
    "we have shown that within radii @xmath2 , corresponding to a fixed density contrast @xmath80 with respect to the critical density at the redshifts of the clusters , the temperature profiles for the present sample of luminous , relatively relaxed lensing clusters exhibit an approximately universal form which rises within @xmath81 and then remains approximately constant out to @xmath2 .",
    "the enclosed masses , bolometric luminosities and mean gas mass - weighted temperatures within these radii scale in manner consistent with the predictions from the simple virial relations outlined in section 1 .",
    "we have confirmed the presence of a systematic offset of @xmath6 per cent between the normalizations of the observed and predicted @xmath44 curves , in the sense that the predicted temperatures are too low for a given mass , for both the scdm and @xmath7cdm cosmologies .",
    "an important aspect of the present study is that independent confirmation of the x - ray mass measurements is available from gravitational lensing studies . for both abell 2390 and rxj1347 - 1145",
    ", the x - ray and weak lensing mass profiles are consistent within their 68 per cent confidence limits . for abell 1835 , 2390",
    ", ms2137 - 2353 and pks0745 - 191 , the observed strong lensing configurations ( on scales @xmath82kpc ) can be explained by mass models within the 68 per cent chandra confidence contours , although redshift measurements for the arcs ( which are required to define the lensing masses precisely ) are not available in all cases .",
    "thus , the presence of significant non - thermal pressure support ( arising from turbulent and/or bulk motions and/or magnetic fields ) can be excluded .",
    "we conclude that the systematic uncertainties associated with the individual mass measurements are small ( @xmath83 per cent ) .",
    "the offset between the observed and simulated mass - temperature curves can not be explained by invoking an earlier formation redshift for the observed clusters ( we assume that the clusters form at the redshifts they are observed ) since , for the measured nfw mass distributions , @xmath84 drops as fast or faster than @xmath85 rises as the formation redshift is increased .",
    "our results suggest that on the spatial scales studied here , important physics may be missing from the reference simulations .",
    "one possible candidate is radiative cooling of the x - ray gas , which the chandra data show to be significant within @xmath86 ( allen 2001a , b , c ; david 2001 ; schmidt 2001 ) .",
    "pearce ( 2000 ) show that the introduction of radiative cooling into their hydrodynamical simulations can lead to central temperature drops similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig : kt ] .",
    "these authors also argue that cooling can lead to a significant increase in the mass - weighted temperature within @xmath87 ( as cooled , low - entropy gas is deposited and warmer , high - entropy material flows inwards and is compressed ) , which may be sufficient to account for the discrepancy between the observed and simulated curves .",
    "detailed simulations of the @xmath44 relation for large a sample of massive clusters , including the effects of radiative cooling , are required to address this issue .",
    "the results presented in this paper should provide a useful calibrator for future studies of the x - ray properties of galaxy clusters .",
    "in future work we will examine the constraints that the present data place on radial variations in the x - ray gas mass fraction in the clusters and , therefore , @xmath88 .",
    "we will also explore the ability of different parameterized mass models to explain the observed x - ray gas temperature and density profiles .",
