    "the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( cgro ) had shown that young pulsars are strong @xmath1-ray sources , and had detected seven @xmath1-ray pulsars ( thompson et al .",
    "the cgro revealed that the light curve with double peaks in a period and the spectrum extending to above gev are typical features of the high - energy emissions from the @xmath1-ray pulsars .",
    "although these data have constrained proposed models , the origin of the @xmath1-ray emission is not yet conclusive .",
    "one important reason is that various models have successfully explained the features of the observed spectra and/or light curves .",
    "for example , in the frame works of the polar cap model ( daugherty & harding 1996 ) , the two - pole caustic model ( dyks & rudak 2003 ) and the outer gap model ( romani & yadigaroglu 1995 ; cheng et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter crz00 ) , the main features of the observed light curve such as two peaks in a period and the emissions between the two peaks are all expected .",
    "so , we can not discriminate the three different models using the observed light curve .",
    "furthermore , both the polar cap and outer gap models have explained the observed @xmath1-ray spectrum ( daugherty & harding 1996 ; romani 1996 ) .",
    "polarization measurement will play an important role to discriminate the various models , because it increases the number of observed parameters , namely , polarization degree ( p.d . ) and position angle ( p.a . )",
    "so far , only the optical polarization data for the crab pulsar is available ( smith et al .",
    "1988 ; kanbach et al . 2005 ) in high energy bands . for the crab pulsar",
    ", the spectrum is continuously extending from optical to @xmath1-ray bands .",
    "in addition , the pulse positions in the wide energy bands are all in phase , which would indicate that the optical emission mechanism is related to higher energy emission mechanisms . in the future",
    ", the next generation compton telescope will probably be able to measure polarization characteristics in mev bands .",
    "these data will be useful for discriminating the different models .",
    "chen et al . ( 1996 ) considered the polarization characteristics in the peaks of the light curve for the crab pulsar with an outer gap model . in that model ,",
    "the synchrotron radiation was used .",
    "the model assumed that the charge particles are distributed with a gauss function in the azimuthal direction to guarantee the formation of the peaks in the light curve .",
    "romani & yadigaroglu ( 1995 ) calculated the polarization characteristics predicted by the curvature radiation process in the frame work of the one pole outer gap model .",
    "in that model , however , the optical polarization data of the crab pulsar was reproduced by very specialized selection of the model parameters such as the inclination angle and the viewing angle of the observer ( dyks et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter dhr04 ) .",
    "dhr04 showed that the two - pole caustic geometry , in which the acceleration region extends from the stellar surface to near the light cylinder , explains the pattern of the p.d . and the fast swing of the p.a . at both peaks in the light curve .",
    "dhr04 also showed that the effect of depolarization due to overlap of the emissions from the different magnetic field lines is not strong so that the intrinsic level of the polarization degree at each radiating point remains in the bridge and off - pulse phases of the light curve .",
    "recently , ptri & kirk ( 2005 ) proposed that the optical emission originates from outside the light cylinder and calculated the polarization characteristic predicted by the pulsar striped wind model ( kirk et al .",
    "however , the observations show that the pulse peaks of the radio , optical , x - ray and @xmath1-ray are all in phase , and it is not clear how the pulsar striped wind can radiate in multi frequency .",
    "furthermore , all of the previous models have not considered the spectrum , the light curve and the polarization all together .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the optical polarization characteristics of the crab pulsar with the spectrum and the light curve predicted by modifying the 3-d outer gap model in crz00 .",
    "crz00 has calculated the synchrotron self - inverse compton scattering process of the secondary pairs produced outside the outer gap and has explained the crab spectrum from x - ray to @xmath1-ray bands .",
    "zhang & cheng ( 2002 ) reconsidered crz00 model and calculated the energy dependent light curves and the phase resolved x - ray spectrum .",
    "in crz00 , however , the outer - wing and the off - pulse emissions of the crab pulsars can not be reproduced , because the traditional outer gap geometry , which extends from the null charge surface of the goldreich - julian charge density ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) to the light cylinder along the magnetic field lines and about @xmath2 in azimuthal direction , is assumed .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum in the optical band was not considered . in this paper , on these grounds , we modify the crz00 geometrical model into a more realistic model , following recent 2-d electrodynamical studies ( takata et al . 2004 , 2006 ; hirotani 2006 ) , and we examine the light curve , the spectrum and the polarization characteristics of the crab pulsar .    in section  [ model ] , we present the high - energy emission model and the calculation method for the polarization . in section",
    "[ result ] , we compare the polarization characteristics in the optical band with the crab data , and demonstrate that the present model reproduces the observed light curve , the spectrum and the polarization characteristics all together .",
    "we diagnose the viewing angle for various inclination angle and for various emission height by comparing the model with the crab optical data . in  section",
    "[ discuss ] , we predict the polarization characteristics in higher energy bands .",
    "the outline of the outer gap model for the crab pulsar is as follows .",
    "the charge particles are accelerated by the electric field ( section  [ oustruc ] ) parallel to the magnetic field lines in so called gap , where the charge density is different from the goldreich - julina charge density ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the angular velocity , @xmath5 is the local magnetic field and @xmath6 is the speed of light .",
    "the high energy particles accelerated in the gap emit the @xmath1-ray photons ( called primary photons ) via the curvature radiation process . for the crab pulsar ,",
    "most of the primary photons escaping from the outer gap will convert into secondary pairs outside the gap , where the accelerating electric field vanishes , by colliding with surface and/or synchrotron x - rays emitted by the secondary pairs .",
    "the secondary pairs emit optical - mev photons via the synchrotron process ( section  [ synemi ] ) and photons above mev with the inverse compton process .",
    "the high - energy photons emitted by the secondary pairs may convert into tertiary pairs at higher altitude by colliding with the soft x - ray from the stellar surface .",
    "the tertiary pairs emit the optical - uv photons via the synchrotron process ( section  [ tertiary ] ) .",
    "this secondary and tertiary photons appear as the observed radiations from the crab pulsar . in section",
    "[ result ] , we will show that although the observed main features of the light curve and the spectrum are explained by the emissions from the secondary pairs , the observed polarization characteristics are explained with the emissions from the tertiary pairs , which were not considered in crz00 .    in section  [ oustruc ]",
    ", we describe the outer gap structure . in section  [ synemi ]",
    ", we discuss the synchrotron emission from the secondary and the tertiary pairs .",
    "the calculation method of the polarization are described in section  [ stokes ] , in section  [ para ] , we introduce the model parameters of the present study .      because the crab pulsar has a thin gap , we describe the accelerating electric field ( cheng et al .",
    "1986a , 1986b ) with    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the local gap thickness in units of the light radius , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the curvature radius of the magnetic field line .",
    "this traditional outer gap model assumes that the outer gap starts from the null charge surface .",
    "however , it has been well known that the traditional outer gap geometry can not reproduce the off - pulse emission of the crab pulsar . on the other hand , recent 2-d electrodynamical studies ( e.g. takata et al . 2004 ; hirotani 2006 ) for the outer gap accelerator have demonstrated that the inner boundary of the outer gap is shifted toward the stellar surface from the null charge surface by the current through the gap .",
    "therefore , we take into account the radiation and the pair - creation processes inside the null charge surface . in such a case ,",
    "the emissions between the stellar surface and the null charge surface contribute to the light curves as the outer - wing and the off - pulse emissions .",
    "as demonstrated by the 2-d electrodynamical model , the electric field inside the null charge surface rapidly decreases along the magnetic field line because of the screening effects of the pairs produced near the inner boundary . to simulate the accelerating electric field inside null charge surface in the present geometrical study",
    ", we assume that the strength of the accelerating field changes quadratically along the magnetic field line as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the strength of the electric field at the null charge surface and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the radial distances to the null charge surface and the inner boundary of the gap , respectively .",
    "for the inclined rotator , the radial distance to the null charge surface varies for different field lines so that the @xmath15 is a function of the azimuthal angle ( @xmath16 ) . in this paper",
    ", the ratio @xmath17 is assumed to be a constant for each field line ( that is , no azimuthal dependence of @xmath18 ) , and is treated as a model parameter .",
    "the local lorentz factor of the accelerated particles ( called primary particles ) in the outer gap is described by @xmath19^{1/4}$ ] with assuming the force balance between the acceleration and the curvature radiation back reaction .",
    "rhe primary photons emitted in the outer gap may make the pairs inside and outside the gap with the soft x - ray from the stellar surface or the synchrotron radiation of the secondary pairs .",
    "chrb ( 1986 ) considered the pair creation process in the gap between the primary curvature photons and the soft photons emitted by the secondary pairs , which was produced outside of the gap by the pair - creation process of the primary photons , and estimated the typical fractional gap size as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the strength of the stellar magnetic field in unit of @xmath22  g and @xmath23 is the rotational period .",
    "however , the soft photons emitted from the secondary pairs may be beamed out of the outer gap , because the secondary pairs are created just outside the gap and emit the photons to the convex side of the field lines .",
    "the screening pairs will be created by the pair - creation process between the primary curvature photons and the surface x - rays .",
    "in such a case , zhang & cheng ( 1997 ) estimated typical fractional size of the outer gap as @xmath24 the local fractional size of the outer gap is estimated by @xmath25 ( crz00 ) . in this paper",
    ", we use the fractional gap size @xmath26 with @xmath27 , which is inferred from the dipole radiation model of the pulsar spin down .",
    "the present 3-d geometrical model assumes that the outer gap extends around the whole polar cap , because we have not had any reliable model for the 3-d geometry of the acceleration region .",
    "if we consider the emission region extending very close to the light cylinder @xmath28 , the expected light curve with a moderately changing emissivity along the field line may have triple or more peaks .",
    "therefore , we expect that the emissivity near the light cylinder is declined and/or the radiations from near the light cylinder are beamed out of line of sight due to the magnetic bending . in the calculation , we constrain the boundaries of the axial distance and radial distance for the emission regions with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the primary photons escaping the outer gap convert into the secondary pairs by colliding the non - thermal x - ray photons , which were emitted by the synchrotron process of the secondary pairs .",
    "the photon spectrum of the synchrotron radiation by the secondary pairs is described by ( crz00 ) @xmath31f(x)de_edv_{rad } , \\label{emis}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the typical photon energy of the secondary pairs , @xmath34 represents lorentz factor of the secondary pairs , @xmath35 is the pitch angle of the particle , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the modified bessel function of order 5/3 , and @xmath38 is the volume element of the radiation region considered .",
    "the distribution of the pairs is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the local power of the curvature radiation , @xmath41 is the goldreich - julian number density , @xmath42 is the characteristic energy of the curvature photons emitted by the primary particles and @xmath43 is the energy loss rate of the synchrotron radiation of the secondary pairs .",
    "the pitch angle of the secondary pairs is estimated from @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the mean free path of the pair - creation between the primary @xmath1-rays and the non - thermal x - rays from the secondary pairs .",
    "the mean free path is estimated from @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the typical non - thermal x - ray number density and @xmath48 is the pair - creation cross section , which is approximately given by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the thomson cross section . for the crab pulsar , the typical number density becomes @xmath51 , where we used the typical energy @xmath52  ev , the typical non - thermal x - ray luminosity @xmath53 , and the solid angle @xmath54  radian . as a result ,",
    "the mean free path becomes @xmath55  cm so that the pitch angle is estimated by @xmath56 , where we used the curvature radius @xmath57 . in this paper , therefore , we adopt @xmath58 .",
    "the local pitch angle is calculated from @xmath59 .",
    "the outer gap extends above the last - open lines with the thickness @xmath60 . and",
    "then , we assume that the secondary pair region extends just above the outer gap with the thickness @xmath45 .",
    "some high - energy photons emitted by the inverse compton process of the secondary pairs may convert into tertiary pairs at higher altitude by colliding with thermal x - ray photons from the star .",
    "the energy of the new born tertiary pairs will be described by the most energetic secondary photons from the secondary pairs . according to the study by crz00 , the most energetic ( @xmath611gev ) secondary photons via the inverse compton process of the secondary pairs are about one order magnitude smaller than that of the primary photons ( @xmath6110gev ) , which make the secondary pairs .",
    "therefore , we expect that the tertiary pairs are produced with a lorentz factor of one order magnitude smaller than that of the secondary pairs .",
    "the optical depth of the pair - creation between the high - energy photons emitted by the secondary pairs and the thermal x - ray photons from the stellar surface is estimated as @xmath62 , with the typical thermal x - ray number density @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the stellar radius , @xmath65 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath66 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath67 is the surface temperature , for which we adopt the reasonable value @xmath68  k ( yakovlev & pethick 2004 ) . in this paper , therefore , we use that the maximum energy of and the local number density of the tertiary pairs are smaller than about @xmath69 of those of the secondary pairs . because the pitch angle of the pairs increases with altitude , we use @xmath70 for the pitch angle of the tertiary pairs .",
    "in fact , the results are not sensitive to the pitch angle of the tertiary pairs .",
    "the tertiary pairs are produced above the region of the secondary pairs . as we will see in section  [ lcurve ]",
    ", the emissions from the secondary pairs make the main features of the light curve such as the two peaks in a period , and the emissions from the tertiary pairs contribute to the bridge phase .      for the crab pulsar , the observed spectrum has a spectral break around 10  ev .",
    "this feature was not considered in crz00 .",
    "one possibility of the explanation of the observed break is due to the effect of the synchrotron cooling .",
    "the damping length due to the synchrotron cooling is given by @xmath71  cm , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the charge particles quickly lose their perpendicular momentum via the synchrotron radiation .",
    "the minimum lorentz factor of the pairs in the magnetosphere may be described by @xmath74 , which is corresponding to the synchrotron characteristic energy @xmath75  ev . in the present model ,",
    "therefore , the spectral index @xmath76 of the synchrotron photons varies from @xmath77 with @xmath78 of equation ( [ dist ] ) in x - ray bands to @xmath79 , which is reflecting the single particle emissivity , below the energy @xmath80 .",
    "we use the rotating dipole field in the inertial observer frame ( hereafter iof ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the previous works such as crz00 and dhr04 used the rotating dipole field in the co - rotating frame , in which the emission direction coincides with the local magnetic field direction , and performed the lorentz transformation to calculate the emission direction in iof .",
    "as a result , the configuration of the magnetic field in iof is different between the present model and the previous works , although the difference is small except for near the light cylinder .    for a high lorentz factor , we can anticipate that the emission direction of the particles coincides with the direction of the particle s velocity .",
    "in iof , the motion of the pairs created outside of the gap may be described by @xmath81 where the first term in the right hand side represents the particle motion along the field line , @xmath82 ( or @xmath83 ) for the particles migrating parallel ( or counter parallel ) to the direction of the magnetic field . in this paper",
    ", we consider only outgoing particles because the photons emitted by ingoing particles will be much fainter than that by the outgoing particles ( crz00 ) .",
    "the second term in equation ( [ pmotion ] ) represents gyration motion around the magnetic field line and the third term is co - rotation motion with the star , @xmath84 .",
    "the unit vector @xmath85 perpendicular to the magnetic field line becomes @xmath86 where @xmath87 represents the gyration of the positrons ( @xmath88 ) and the electrons ( @xmath89 ) , @xmath90 refers the phase of gyration motion and latexmath:[$\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}=(\\mbox{\\boldmath$b$}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mbox{\\boldmath$b$}/    vector of the curvature of the magnetic field lines .",
    "the gyration phase @xmath90 is defined so that the value increases in the direction of the gyration motion of the positrons and so that the pairs with @xmath92 emit the photons in the plane spanned by the directions of the local magnetic field and it s curvature if there were no co - rotation motion in equation ( [ pmotion ] ) .",
    "the co - rotation motion affects the emission direction as the aberration effect .",
    "the value of @xmath93 at each point is determined by the condition that @xmath94 .",
    "the emission direction of equation ( [ pmotion ] ) is described in terms of the viewing angle measured from the rotational axis , @xmath95 , and the rotation phase , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the component of the emission direction parallel to the rotational axis , @xmath98 is the azimuthal angle of the emission direction and @xmath99 is the emitting location in units of the light radius .",
    "because the particles distribute on the gyration phase @xmath90 , the emitted beam at each point must become cone like shape with opening angle @xmath100 . for each radiating point , the emission directions of the different particles on the gyration phase are projected onto the different points in @xmath101 plane .",
    "furthermore , the polarization plane of the radiations also depends on the gyration phases of the radiating particles .",
    "taking into account the dependence on the gyration phase , therefore , we calculate the radiations from the particles for all of the gyration phase @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "figure  [ map ] shows the emission projection onto @xmath101 plane for different gyration phases @xmath104 and @xmath105 for the positrons .",
    "for the electrons , we find from the equation  ( [ gyration ] ) that the emission projection map of the electrons is identical with figure  [ map ] but the gyration phase is different by @xmath2 ; for example , the panels for @xmath106 and @xmath0 for the positrons in figure  [ map ] also describe the projection maps of emission from the electrons with @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .    with the projection map of the emissions ,",
    "the expected pulse profile is determined by choosing the viewing angle @xmath109 of the observer and collecting all photons from the possible emitting points and the gyration phases with the emissivity of equation ( [ emis ] ) .",
    "we assume that the radiation at each point linearly polarizes with degree of @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the power law index of the particle distribution , and circular polarization is zero , that is , @xmath112 in terms of the stokes parameters .",
    "the direction of the electric vector of the electro - magnetic wave toward the observer is parallel to the projected direction of the acceleration of the particle on the sky ( blaskiewicz et al .",
    "the magnitude of the microscopic acceleration of the gyration motion is much larger than that of the macroscopic acceleration of the co - rotation motion so that the ratio of the magnitude of the two accelerations becomes @xmath113 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the gyration and the co - rotation frequencies , respectively . unless the pitch angle is very small , the acceleration with equation ( [ pmotion ] )",
    "is approximately written by @xmath116 the electric vector @xmath117 emitted in the direction @xmath118 becomes @xmath119 .    to calculate the stokes parameters @xmath120 and @xmath121 for each radiating point",
    ", we define the position angle @xmath122 to be angle between the electric field @xmath117 and the projected rotational axis on the sky , @xmath123 .",
    "the stokes parameters @xmath124 and @xmath125 at each radiation is represented by @xmath126 and @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the intensity . after collecting the photons from the possible points for each rotation phase @xmath129 and a viewing angle @xmath109 , the expected p.d . and p.a .",
    "are , respectively , obtained from @xmath130 and @xmath131,\\ ] ] where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the stokes parameters after collecting the photons .",
    "finally , we describe the difference between polarization characteristics predicted by the curvature emission and synchrotron emission models . if we ignore the effects of the aberration due to the co - rotation motion , the direction of the electric vector of the wave for the curvature and synchrotron cases are , respectively , parallel to and perpendicular to the magnetic field projected on the sky ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "secondly , in the curvature radiation model the photons are radiated only one direction at each point , which coincides with the direction of the local magnetic field line if we ignore the aberration effect .",
    "furthermore , the radiations from neighboring positions polarize in similar directions . in such a case ,",
    "the intrinsic level of the polarization degree at the each radiating point remains in the bridge and off - pulse phase of the light curve ( dhr04 ) .",
    "therefore , to explain the observed polarization degree @xmath134 at the bridge phase of the crab pulsar , the curvature emission model may require the radiation linearly polarized with about 10% at each radiating points .",
    "as we have mentioned for the synchrotron case , on the other hand , the photons are emitted along the surface of the cone with opening angle @xmath35 at each radiating position .",
    "furthermore , the polarization plane of the radiation depends on the gyration phase of the radiating particle .",
    "in such a case , the observed radiation consists of the radiations from the different particles on the gyration phase .",
    "this overlap of the radiations causes a strong depolarization , and as a result a lower polarization degree is expected for the synchrotron case .",
    "we need not assume the radiations with a low polarization degree at each radiating point to explain the crab data . in the present model , the intrinsic polarization degree of the radiation at the each radiating point is @xmath135 using the particle distribution @xmath78 described by equation ( [ dist ] ) .      in this subsection",
    ", we introduce the model parameters .",
    "the inclination angle @xmath136 and the viewing angles @xmath109 measured from the rotational axis are the model parameters . because the inner boundary of the outer gap is determined by the current through the gap ( takata et al .",
    "2004 ) , we consider the position of inner boundary located inside of the null charge . in this paper ,",
    "the ratio of the radial distances to the inner boundary @xmath137 and the null charge surface of the rotating dipole @xmath138 , which is a function of the azimuthal angle , is teated as a model parameters , and is assumed to be constant for each field line as described in section  [ oustruc ] .",
    "since the magnetic field must be modified by the rotational and the plasma effects near the light cylinder , the last - open field line must be different with the traditional magnetic surface that is tangent to the light cylinder for the vacuum case .",
    "for example ,",
    "romani ( 1996 ) defined the last open lines as the field lines parallel to the rotational axis at @xmath139 . where the corotational velocity equals the alfvn speed .",
    "to specify the gap upper surface , therefore , it is convenient to refer the footpoints of the magnetic field lines on the stellar surface . with the assumption that the gap upper surface coincides with a magnetic surface , we parameterize the fractional polar angle @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the polar angle of the footpoints of the magnetic field lines of the gap upper surface and @xmath142 is the polar angle of the field lines which are tangent to the light cylinder for the vacuum case .",
    "finally , we describe how the model parameters ( @xmath136 , @xmath109 , @xmath137 and @xmath143 ) are diagnosed by the present model and the crab data .",
    "the model parameters are chosen so that the expected light curve , the spectrum and the polarization characteristics are simultaneously consistent with the crab data such as the phase separation @xmath144  phase between two peaks and the large position angle swings at the both peaks .",
    "as we will demonstrate in section  [ lcurve ] , the features of the expected light curve is sensitive to the viewing angle @xmath109 but not to the position of the inner boundary @xmath137 , if we fix the inclination angle @xmath136 and the fractional angle @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , the viewing angle @xmath109 is determined by comparing the model and the observed light curves . with the determined viewing angle ,",
    "on the other hand , the radial distance to the inner boundary @xmath137 affects sensitively to the polarization characteristics at the off - pulse phase .",
    "therefore , if the inclination angle @xmath136 and the gap upper surface @xmath143 are determined in some way , the viewing angle @xmath109 of the observer and the position of the inner boundary of the outer gap @xmath137 are diagnosed by the present model and the crab data .",
    "the present geometrical model produces a consistent spectrum with the crab data ( section  [ polari ] ) using the viewing angle determined from the observed light curve .",
    "we need not introduce another model parameter for fitting the spectrum .",
    "it is difficult to constrain both the inclination angle @xmath136 and the upper surface @xmath143 with the present model .",
    "as we will show in section  [ inmag ] , however , if either inclination angle @xmath136 or the altitude of the upper surface @xmath143 is determined in some way , the other may be diagnosed by the present model .",
    "figure  [ compari ] compares the polarization characteristics at 1  ev predicted by three different emission geometries .",
    "the left column summarizes the results for the traditional outer gap geometry , in which the inner boundary of the gap is located at the null charge surface of the goldreich - julian charge density .",
    "although the traditional model in crz00 and the present model assume the different extensions of the outer gap in the azimuthal direction , that is around half ( in crz00 ) and whole ( in the present model ) polar - cap region , we find that the predicted polarization characteristics are not so different between the two azimuthal extension of the outer gap geometries as long as the inner boundary is located at the null charge surface . in this section , therefore , the gap geometry that stars from the null charge surface and extends around whole polar cap region is also called as `` traditional geometry '' .",
    "the middle and right in figure  [ compari ] columns show the results for the radial distance of 67% of the distance to null charge surface @xmath145 , and the right column is taking into account also the emissions from the tertiary pairs .",
    "the other model parameters are @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 , where the viewing angle is chosen so that the predicted phase separation between the two peaks is consistent with the observed value @xmath144  phase . in the figure , we define zero of the rotation phase at the main peak .    by comparing the pulse profiles between the light curves of the left and middle columns , we find that the radiations from the secondary pairs inside the null charge surface contribute to the outer - wing and the off - pulse emissions . in the present case ,",
    "the off - pulse emissions are @xmath149 of the peak flux , because the line of sight marginally passes through the emission regions in the off - pulse phase as the horizontal lines show in figure  [ map ] . near the inner boundary , because the accelerating electric field and resultant the energy of emitted primary photons in the gap are small , the secondary pairs are produced with a lower energy , and emit the synchrotron photons with a smaller emissivity .    as figure  [ map ] indicates , the emerging radiations in the light curve originate from the two poles ; one pole contributes to the light curve with the two peaks and the bridge photons emitted beyond the null charge surface , and the other contributes with the outer - wing and the off - pulse photons emitted inside the null charge surface .",
    "dyks & rudak ( 2003 ) have proposed the radiations associated with two magnetic pole . in that model , with the constant emissivity along the magnetic field lines , the two peaks are associated with the different poles and the different emission regions , and are formed by the caustic effect near the stellar surface . in the present outer gap model , on the other hand , the electric field , and the resultant emissivity of the synchrotron radiation of the secondary pairs quickly decreases inside the null charge surface . therefore , although the caustic effect near the stellar surface is strong , the emissions inside the null charge surface do not make a strong peak compared with the present main peak , which is formed by the radiations near the light cylinder . in the present case ,",
    "therefore , the two peaks in the light curve is associated with the one magnetic pole .    by comparing the flux levels of the bridge emissions between the light curves in the middle and right columns",
    ", we find that the tertiary pairs mainly contribute to the emissions at the bridge phase .",

    "in such a case , the depolarization is weaker and the emerging radiation highly polarizes .",
    "as the polarization degrees in the middle and right columns in figure  [ compari ] show , the radiations from the inside the null charge surface may be observed with a large polarization degree at the off - pulse phase .",

    "the present model ( e.g. the polarization characteristics in the right column in figure  [ compari ] ) predicts that radiation from the magnetospheric component at the off - pulse phase has a relatively constant position angle , which is about @xmath0 difference from that in the bridge phase .",

    "we assume that the pairs escape from the light cylinder with the lorentz factor @xmath161 ( section  [ cooling ] ) , which predicts the spectral break around 10  ev .",
    "the model spectrum also explains the general features of the data .",
    "therefore , the outer gap model can explain the general features of the observed light curve , the spectrum and the polarization characteristics in optical band for the crab pulsar , simultaneously .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the dependence of the polarization characteristics on the model parameters and diagnose that for the crab pulsar .",
    "figure  [ compari1 ] summarizes the dependence of the polarization characteristics on the viewing angle . with @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath162 , the left , middle and right columns show , respectively , the polarization characteristics for the viewing angle of @xmath163 , @xmath148 and @xmath164 . for @xmath148 , the phase separation of the two peaks in the light curve",
    "is @xmath144  phase similar with the observation .",
    "we can see that the phase separation becomes wider ( or narrower ) with decreasing ( of increasing ) the viewing angle from @xmath148 . for example , as the light curve of the left column shows , the phase separation between two peaks for @xmath165 becomes obviously wider than @xmath144  phase . on the other hand ,",

    "furthermore , in the light curve for @xmath164 , we can see a conspicuous peak in the leading - wing of the main peak .",
    "this leading small peak is formed by the radiations inside the null charge surface of the radiation region connecting to the other pole , while the main peak is formed by the radiations near the light cylinder .",
    "for @xmath165 and @xmath159 , these two peaks are observed as a single main peak , because the phase separation of the two peaks is very narrow .    by comparing the p.d . for three cases ,",
    "we find that p.d . in off - pulse phase increases with the viewing angle ; e.g. typical p.d . in the off - pulse phase",

    "increasing the viewing angle with a specific position of the inner boundary @xmath137 , the line of sight approaches the inner boundary from inside the emission region as we can expect from figure  [ map ] , and then the radiations from wider range of the gyration phases become to be beamed out of the line of the sight .",
    "therefore , the p.d . in off - pulse phase increases with the viewing angle . finally , if the line of sight passes through outside the emission region , there are no emissions in the off - pulse phase such as the light curve of the right column in figure  [ compari1 ] .",
    "as we have seen , the viewing angle affects sensitively to the model light curve and the polarization degree in the off - pulse phase . in the present model ,",

    ", we see that the main features of the p.a .",
    "( e.g. the large swings at both peaks ) do not depend the position of the inner boundary .",
    "therefore , the dependence of the position of the inner boundary mainly appears as the difference of the p.d . at the off - pulse phase",

    ", however , both the emissions from the magnetosphere and the back ground ( e.g. the wind region , and probably nebula ) components would contribute to the off - pulse emissions .",
    "it is not clear which component dominates the emissions in the off - pulse phase , while the magnetospheric component must dominate in the pulse and the bridge phases . to constrain the inner boundary of the emission region with the present magnetospheric radiation model ,",
    "the model requires the data of the p.d . of the off - pulse emissions from the magnetosphere . if the p.d . of the magnetospheric component",
    "are measured at the off - pulse phase , the present model will be able to restrict the radial distance of the inner boundary better .",
    "furthermore , we may be able to diagnose how large current runs through the gap with the present geometrical model and the crab optical data , because the position of the inner boundary of the gap is related to the current through the gap ( takata et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "as we have seen in sections  [ viewing ] and [ inner ] , the polarization characteristics are sensitive to the both viewing angle @xmath109 and the position of the inner boundary @xmath137 , on the other hand , the expected light curve is sensitive to only the viewing angle @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the viewing angle is restricted by the observed light curve rather than the polarization characteristics . with the viewing angle determined by the light curve , the position of the inner boundary",
    "is restricted by the polarization characteristics .      as we have shown in sections  [ viewing ] and [ inner ] ,",
    "if the inclination angle and the altitude of the gap upper surface could be determined , the viewing angle @xmath109 are restricted by the observed light curve , and then the position of the inner boundary of the gap @xmath137 are determined by the crab optical polarization data . in this section , we examine how @xmath109 and @xmath137 for explaining the crab data are changing with the inclination angle @xmath136 and the altitude of the gap upper surface ( in other words the fractional angle @xmath143 ) , above which the secondary pairs are produced and the emit the observed photons . for each inclination angle @xmath136 and the altitude of the gap upper surface @xmath143 , the viewing angle @xmath109",
    "is chosen to explain the observed characteristics that the light curve has two peaks , first peak is stronger than the second peak ( in optical band ) and the phase separation between two peaks is @xmath184  phase .",
    "the position of the inner boundary @xmath137 is determined so that the p.a . has a large swings at the both peaks , and the p.d . in the off - pulse phase",
    "becomes about @xmath168 because we do not have accurate data of the p.d .",
    "for the magnetospheric radiations at the off - pulse phase .",
    "table  1 summarizes the expected viewing angle @xmath109 and the radial distance to the inner boundary @xmath137 for the inclination angles @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 and the various altitude of the gap upper surface . in the table ,",
    "the increasing of the value of the fractional angle @xmath143 means the decreasing of the altitude of the upper surface of the gap with @xmath26 , and of the emissions region of the secondary pairs .",
    "we find that there is a critical altitude of the upper surface ( @xmath188 ) for each inclination angle ; e.g @xmath189 for @xmath185 , @xmath190 for @xmath146 and @xmath191 for @xmath192 . with a fractional angle @xmath143 smaller than the critical value ( in other words , with a higher upper surface than the critical altitude ) , there are no viewing angle that produces the light curve consistent with data , and the expected light curve has triple peaks ( leading peak , main peak and second peak ) such like the light curve in the right column of figure  [ compari1 ] .    for a specific inclination angle @xmath136 , the expected viewing angle @xmath109 increases with decreasing the altitude of the gap upper surface ( or with the increasing the fractional angle @xmath143 ) . the reason is explained as follows .",
    "firstly , the phase separation of the two peaks increases with decreasing emission height because the area of the magnetic surface for the radiation regions becomes wider for lower altitude ; for example , the viewing angle @xmath148 produces the phase separation @xmath193  phase in the light curve with @xmath185 and @xmath194 , and therefore predicts a wider phase separation of the two peaks than @xmath195  phase for @xmath196 .",
    "secondarily , the phase separation of the two peaks becomes narrower with increasing the viewing angle as shown in figure  [ compari1 ] . as a result , the suitable viewing angle @xmath197 of @xmath196 is larger than @xmath148 of @xmath194 .",
    "we also find that the critical altitude of the upper surface decreases when the inclination angle @xmath136 increases . as we have discussed in section  [ lcurve ] ,",
    "if the phase separation between the main peak and the small leading peak , which originates of the emissions inside null charge surface , is enough narrow , these two peaks appear as a single main peak in the light curve .",
    "if it is not , the light curve has a small peak in the leading - wing of the main peak . with a fixed altitude of the upper surface @xmath143 , greater inclination angle @xmath136 produces a wider phase separation between the main peak and the leading small peak .",
    "on the other hand , a lower altitude of the emission region with a fixed inclination angle produces a narrower phase separation of the two peaks . as a result , to have a single main peak without the leading small peak , a lower altitude of the emission regions of the secondary pairs , in other words ,",
    "a larger value of the fractional angle @xmath143 of the gap upper surface is required for a greater inclination angle @xmath136 .",
    "the position of the inner boundary @xmath137 , which is chosen so that the p.d . at the off - pulse phase becomes @xmath198 , approaches to the stellar surface with decreasing ( or increasing ) of the altitude of the gap upper surface ( or the fractional angle @xmath143 ) . as we discussed in the third paragraph of this section , a larger viewing angle @xmath109 is preferred for explaining the phase separation of the two peaks for a lower altitude of the gap upper surface . and ,",
    "the larger viewing angle ( for @xmath199 ) detects the photons emitted from the positions nearer the stellar surface .",
    "therefore , the inner boundary is shifted toward stellar surface to hold a constant p.d . at the off - pulse phase with decreasing ( or increasing ) of the altitude of the upper surface ( or the fractional angle @xmath143 ) .",
    "finally , the present local model can not identify the inclination angle @xmath136 and the altitude of the upper gap surface , where may be determined by the observation or other ways .",
    "however if either the inclination angle or the gap upper surface is determined , the present model can constrain the other one ; for example , if the inclination angle of @xmath200 were determined , the crab pulsar should have the gap upper surface , which is located at lower altitude than that referred by @xmath201 .",
    "if the inclination angle @xmath136 and the altitude of the upper surface are determined , the viewing angle @xmath109 and the position of the inner boundary @xmath137 are determined by the observed light curve and the polarization characteristics as we discussed in sections  [ viewing ] and  [ inner ] .",
    "we have considered the light curve and the spectrum for the crab pulsar predicted by the outer gap model which takes into account the emissions from the inside the null charge surface and from the tertiary pairs .",
    "we have also calculated the polarization characteristics in the optical band .",
    "we have shown that the emissions from the inside the null charge surface contribute to the outer - wing and the off - pulse phase .",
    "on the other hand , the radiations from the tertiary pairs contribute to the bridge emissions of the light curve .",
    "we find that the expected polarization characteristics are consistent with the crab optical data after subtraction of the dc level .",
    "the general features of the polarization characteristics , the light curve and the spectrum in optical bands have been reproduced simultaneously . for the crab pulsar ,",
    "the observed position angle swing indicates that the viewing angle of the observer measured from the rotational axis is greater than @xmath0 .",
    "although the present model has explained the observed light curve , spectrum and the polarization characteristics in the optical band for the crab pulsar , we also find that the small peak , which leads the main peak and originates from the emissions inside null charge surface , becomes to be conspicuous with increasing the energy bands if we fixed the model parameters to produce the phase separation @xmath144  phase between the main and the second peaks .",
    "the main peak consists of the radiations from the near the light cylinder , while the leading peak consists of the radiations near the stellar surface .",
    "the spectrum of the photons of the leading peak becomes harder than that of the main peak , because the magnetic field near the stellar surface is much stronger than that near the light cylinder .",
    "the flux ratio of the leading peak and the main peak decreases with increasing the energy bands . as a result ,",
    "the expected light curve in higher energy bands may have triple peaks although the light curve in the optical has only two peaks .",
    "if we are allowed a small discrepancy on the phase separation between the main and the second peaks with the crab data @xmath144 , the present model can successful explain the general features of other observed features .",
    "figure  [ enecompari ] summarizes the results for the viewing angles @xmath163 and @xmath202 with the inclination angle @xmath146 and the gap upper surface of @xmath147 .",
    "we see that although the phase separation @xmath203  phase of the two peaks is slightly larger than @xmath193  phase for the crab pulsar , the leading peak originating from the emissions near the stellar surface keeps a low profile in the light curves in wide energy bands .",
    "furthermore , we note that the model light curves reproduce the energy dependent features of the observed light curves that the flux levels of the second peak and bridge phase increase relative to that of the main peak , and the flux levels of the two peaks become to be the same at around 10  kev ( kuiper et al .",
    "because the phase separation of the main and the second peaks depends on the configuration of the magnetic field , the present results may predict that actual magnetic field in the pulsar magnetosphere is modified on some level from the vacuum dipole field , which has been assumed in the present paper , by the plasma effects ( muslimov & harding 2005 ) .    from figure  [ enecompari ]",
    ", we can see that the polarization characteristics depend on the energy bands .",
    "especially , the polarization degree in the bridge phase decreases from about @xmath69 in optical band with increasing the energy bands . in the optical band ,",
    "the tertiary pairs contribute to the bridge emissions with about @xmath69 of the p.d . for higher energy bands , on the other hand",
    ", the emissions from the secondary pairs dominate in the bridge phase , because the tertiary pairs contribute to the bridge emissions with a smaller lorentz factor and emissivity via the synchrotron process . in such a case , the lower p.d .",
    "than @xmath69 is expected in the bridge phase as we have seen in section  [ polari ] .",
    "therefore , the present model predicts that the polarization characteristics in the bridge phase depends on the energy bands . in the pulse and the off - pulse phases , the polarization characteristics do not depend the energy bands very much , because the synchrotron radiation from the secondary pairs takes a main contribution from optical to soft x - ray emissions .",
    "above hard x - ray bands , the inverse compton process of the secondary pairs will contribute to the emissions .",
    "because the next generation compton telescope will probably be able to measure the polarization characteristics in mev bands , it will be required to model prediction for it , which will be the issue in the subsequent papers .",
