    "ever since the realisation that cepheids are stars undergoing radial pulsation @xcite , the oscillation of stars has been an important research area . with much improved sensitivity , observations over the last few years have established a plethora of pulsating stars .",
    "the best case by far is provided by the sun for which it is known @xcite that many high order pressure p - modes , and perhaps also the gravity g - modes and the coriolis restored r - modes , are excited . by combining observational data with theoretical models",
    "researchers have been able to infer details of the sun s internal structure , e.g.  the sound speed at different depths .",
    "these impressive results of so - called `` helioseismology '' provide inspiration for further research into stellar oscillations and the hope that `` asteroseismology '' @xcite will help further unveil details of the structure of distant stars .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to advance our modelling of non - radial oscillations of non - rotating , old and cold neutron stars that contain superfluid components .    within the framework of general relativity",
    "oscillating compact stars provide an interesting potential source of gravitational radiation .",
    "there are several scenarios in which one would expect a neutron star to pulsate wildly , e.g.  following its formation in a gravitational collapse , and it is interesting to ask whether the associated gravitational waves could be detected on earth .",
    "should this be the case , one can hope to use the gravitational - wave data to probe the star s interior and possibly put constraints on the supranuclear equation of state @xcite .    in the last few years",
    "much attention has been focussed on gravitational - wave driven mode - instabilities in rapidly rotating stars .",
    "ever since the seminal work of chandrasekhar , friedman and schutz @xcite in the 1970s it has been known that gravitational waves can drive various modes of oscillation unstable , and recently it has been shown that the r - modes are particularly susceptible to the instability @xcite .",
    "most astrophysical r - mode scenarios regard hot young neutron stars , but it has also been proposed @xcite that the instability may operate in mature accreting neutron stars , e.g.  in low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "these stars are expected to have core temperatures well below the superfluid transition temperature , and hence one would need to account for superfluidity in any detailed r - mode model .",
    "this is particularly important since mutual friction may provide a strong dissipative mechanism on any mode in a superfluid star @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , it has been argued that the presence of a viscous boundary layer at the base of the crust of a mature neutron star will lead to a very strong damping on the r - modes @xcite . while the issue of mutual friction has been discussed by lindblom and mendell @xcite , there are as yet no studies of dissipation due to a `` realistic '' core - crust interface , that is likely to involve the transition from a regime where superfluid neutrons co - exist with a lattice of crust nuclei to a region composed of superfluid neutrons and ( possibly superconducting ) protons",
    ".    further motivation for our current work is provided by results from attempts to model the equation of state at supranuclear densities .",
    "many modern equation of state calculations ( within relativistic mean field theory ) predict a sizeable hyperon fraction at high densities . however , the hyperons act as an effective `` refrigerant '' which means that the star would cool very fast .",
    "in fact , it has been argued that the presence of hyperons would lead to core temperatures well below those indicated by observations .",
    "the favoured resolution to this problem corresponds to the hyperons being superfluid .",
    "in addition , neutron stars may have cores composed of deconfined quarks which may also pair into exotic superfluid states .",
    "in other words , if we want to understand the dynamics of the core of a realistic mature neutron star we have to allow for one ( or more ) partially decoupled superfluid components .",
    "the need for an improved understanding of these problems was recently emphasized by the suggestion that the presence of hyperons in the deep core would lead to a strong bulk viscosity wich could potentially completely suppress the unstable r - modes @xcite .",
    "this suggestion brings may difficult issues to the top of the agenda . for example , a detailed study of unstable modes must necessarily account for the fact that a superfluid component(s ) may move relative to the normal fluid component .",
    "one might expect this to have a significant effect on the estimates of time scales for an unstable mode .",
    "furthermore , as has been pointed out by andersson and comer @xcite , one would expect new classes of r - modes ( and indeed other inertial modes ) to exist in a superfluid star .",
    "this means that the superfluid problem is likely to be richer than the ordinary , single fluid , one .",
    "given that there have not yet been any detailed investigations into these issues it may be premature to draw any definite conclusions regarding the effect that superfluidity may have on mode - instabilities .",
    "it is clear that a considerable amount of work on stars with one , or several , superfluid components remains to be done before we can claim to have an understanding of possible instabilities in mature neutron stars .",
    "these problems provide strong motivation for our current work .",
    "studies of oscillating superfluid stars were pioneered by epstein @xcite , who was the first to suggest that there ought to exist modes of oscillation that are unique to the superfluid case .",
    "these modes have since been calculated both in newtonian theory @xcite and general relativity @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that a simple two - fluid model of a superfluid neutron star core has two families of fluid pulsation modes .",
    "the first of these is essentially the standard pressure p - modes , for which the two fluids tend to move together .",
    "the superfluid modes , on the other hand , are distinguished by the fact that the two fluids are counter - moving @xcite .",
    "another distinguishing characteristic of the superfluid modes is that their mode frequencies have a fundamental dependence on entrainment .",
    "andersson and comer @xcite have used a local analysis of the newtonian superfluid equations to show that the modes are essentially acoustic in nature , with frequencies that depend on the stellar parameters as ^2_s c^2 _  , [ sfreq ] where @xmath0 is ( roughly ) the speed of sound in the proton fluid , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the bare and effective proton masses , respectively , @xmath3 is the radial coordinate , and @xmath4 is the index of the relevant spherical harmonic @xmath5 .",
    "these results have recently been confirmed by detailed mode - calculations @xcite .",
    "the strong dependence of the superfluid modes on parameters that are difficult to constrain otherwise suggest a strategy that may be used in conjunction with future observations to narrow down the theoretical uncertainties @xcite .",
    "specifically , an observational determination of the mode frequencies of an oscillating neutron star could be used to constrain the proton effective mass in dense nuclear matter .",
    "this would have immediate implications for bcs energy gap calculations since the effective mass is part of the required information ( see , for instance , khodel , khodel , and clark @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the equations that describe polar perturbations ( even parity ) of a general relativistic superfluid neutron star , using as our starting point the formalism developed by comer , langlois , and lin @xcite .",
    "the neutron star is assumed to consist of two distinct regions : a core consisting of matter in superfluid states , and an envelope of ordinary fluid matter .",
    "we report progress in three important directions .",
    "firstly , we have obtained the first ever results for gravitational - wave damping rates of the superfluid oscillation modes .",
    "this is important as it allows us to assess the relevance of these modes for gravitational - wave astronomy .",
    "secondly , we have developed a framework in which a superfluid region can be matched to an ordinary fluid region .",
    "( lindblom & mendell @xcite have employed a similar model in the newtonian regime . )",
    "the introduction of an ordinary fluid envelope is the first step towards allowing for the presence of superfluids that are confined to distinct regions in the star .",
    "however , it is important to point out that since we do not incorporate elasticity in our model the envelope does not play the same role as the crust of a mature neutron star .",
    "in essence , our model corresponds to a star in which the fluid degrees of freedom contain a conglomerate `` proton '' fluid ( consisting of nuclei and electrons in the envelope , and electrons and superconducting protons in the core ) that extends from the surface to the center of the star and superfluid neutrons that exist only in the core .",
    "we work out the relevant junction / boundary conditions at the core / envelope interface and determine the quasinormal modes for such a neutron star model .",
    "thirdly , we have included a simple model for the so - called entrainment effect , based on an explicit equation of state and an approximation that assumes that the fluid velocities are small compared to the speed of light .",
    "this allows us to provide the first detailed results describing the effect that entrainment has on the oscillation modes of a superfluid star .",
    "as we will show , this leads to the presence of so - called `` avoided crossings '' between neighbouring modes as the strength of entrainment is varied .",
    "the main body of the paper begins with a discussion , in sec .",
    "[ eqns ] , of the basic formalism used to describe non - radial , linearized oscillations of general relativistic superfluid neutron stars .",
    "this contains a discussion of the background , spherically symmetric and static equilibrium configurations , and the introduction of the variables that are used to model the non - radial oscillations .",
    "we also describe the key details of the numerical methods used to solve the linearized einstein / superfluid field equations .",
    "the equation of state and inclusion of the entrainment effect are described in sec .",
    "[ aem ] , and the results of our numerical analysis are presented in sec .",
    "[ numres ] . in sec .",
    "[ nonrad ] we prove that all pulsation modes of a superfluid star must radiate gravitational waves , unless the equation of state belongs to a very special class . finally , we consider in sec .  [ gws ]",
    "the question of whether or not superfluid modes , excited , for instance , during a pulsar glitch , can be reliably extracted from gravitational - wave data .",
    "some final remarks are offered in the concluding sec .",
    "for clarity of presentation and emphasis of the main physical results , we have relegated some of the formal , mathematical details to appendices .",
    "appendix i is devoted to a derivation of the junction conditions used to tie together the core with the envelope . in appendix",
    "ii we present an analytical equation of state that can be used to incorporate the lowest - order effects of entrainment .",
    "finally , in appendix iii a new method is presented which can be used to accurately determine long - lived quasinormal modes .",
    "we will be using geometrized units ( except in appendix ii where the speed of light is restored ) and `` mtw '' @xcite conventions throughout the paper .",
    "in this section we summarise the equations that govern the equilibrium configurations of the superfluid core and the normal fluid envelope . what must be determined in the core are the neutron and proton number densities , and two metric coefficients . in the envelope",
    "only the proton number density remains but there are still two metric coefficients to specify .",
    "we also describe the complicated set of coupled linear perturbation equations that need to be integrated , and outline the computational strategy that we have adopted .    in what follows",
    ", the center of the star is at radial coordinate @xmath6 , the core / envelope interface will be at @xmath7 , and the surface at @xmath8 .",
    "the formalism to be used here , and motivation for it , has been described in great detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "hence , we will only mention the key features here .",
    "the central quantity of the superfluid formalism is the so - called master function @xmath9 .",
    "it depends on the three scalars @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 that can be formed from the conserved neutron ( @xmath13 ) and proton ( @xmath14 ) number density currents .",
    "the master function is such that , when the two fluids are co - moving , @xmath15 corresponds to the total thermodynamic energy density . once the master function is provided ( see sec .",
    "[ numres ] for a simple analytic equation of state ) the stress - energy tensor is given by t^_= ^_+ p^_+ n^ _  , where = - n^_- p^_[press ] is the generalised pressure , and @xmath16 are the chemical potential covectors .",
    "we have also introduced = - x^2  , = -2 n^2  , = -2 p^2  .",
    "the momentum covectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 are dynamically , and thermodynamically , conjugate to @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the two covectors also make manifest the so - called entrainment effect , that affects the dynamics of a superfluid neutron star in a crucial way .",
    "it is easy to see that the momentum of one constituent ( @xmath17 , say ) carries along some of the mass current of the other constituent if @xmath21 ( since @xmath17 is a linear combination of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) . on the other hand , if @xmath24 , i.e. if the master function does not depend on @xmath25 , then there is no entrainment .",
    "while the standard one - fluid problem can be expressed solely in terms of the einstein equations , with the fluid equations of motion being automatically satisfied `` by virtue of the bianchi identities '' , the two - fluid problem is different . because of the additional dynamic degrees of freedom associated with the second fluid we need to use also ( a subset of ) the fluid equations of motion .",
    "the equations that need to be solved , in addition to the einstein field equations , are two `` continuity '' equations _",
    "n^= _ p^= 0",
    ". [ conteq]these equations represent conservation of the superfluid neutrons and the protons separately .",
    "that is , we ignore `` transfusion '' from one component to the other due to , for example , weak interactions @xcite .",
    "this is likely to be a reasonable approximation for the timescales and amplitudes that are relevant for nonradial pulsation .",
    "we also have two euler - type equations n^ _ [ _ ] = p^ _ [ _ ] = 0  . [ euleq ]      in order to determine the background fluid configuration we need to evaluate the associated metric .",
    "we take our equilibrium configurations to be spherically symmetric and static , so the metric can be written in the schwarzschild form ds^2 = - e^ dt^2 + e^ dr^2 + r^2 ( d^2 + sin^2 d^2 )  .",
    "[ bgmet ] the two metric coefficients are determined from two components of the einstein equations , which can be written in the form ^ = 1 - e^ r - 8 r e^ , ^ = - 1 - e^ r + 8 r e^  , [ bckgrnd ] where a primes represents a radial derivative , and it is to be understood that @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the interval @xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the interval @xmath31 .    the equations that determine the radial profiles of @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the core have been derived in comer , langlois , and lin @xcite . they follow from ( [ euleq ] ) , and can be written ^0_0 ^ + ^0_0 ^ + 1 2 ( + a ) ^ = 0 , ^0_0 ^ + ^0_0 ^ + 1 2 ( + ) ^ = 0  , [ bgndfl_c ] where @xmath34 in the coefficients above , one sets @xmath35 after the partial derivatives are taken for the equilibrium configuration .",
    "for the particular model equation of state we use in our numerical calculations , the above equations require that the two fluids have a common surface ( i.e. @xmath36 as @xmath37 ) if one assumes chemical equilibrium .",
    "the oscillations of such models were studied in @xcite . here",
    "we want to consider models such that the two - fluid regime is enclosed within a single fluid envelope .",
    "it is easy to build such a model by relaxing the assumption of chemical equilibrium in the core .",
    "the resultant models are likely not too unrealistic given the relatively long timescales required for nuclear interactions to reinstate equilibrium .",
    "our models are such that the superfluid neutron number density is zero in the envelope , and thus the only matter equation is ^0_0 ^ + 1 2 c ^ = 0  , [ bgndfl_e ] where now = - 2 ^2 , 00 = + 2 ^2 ^2  .",
    "there are three sets of `` boundary '' conditions that must be dealt with : a set at the center , one at the interface , and the remaining one at the surface of the star . in view of eq .",
    "( [ bckgrnd ] ) , requiring a non - singular behavior at the center of the star will impose that @xmath38 , and consequently @xmath39 and @xmath40 must also vanish .",
    "this in turn implies , in view of eq .",
    "( [ bgndfl_c ] ) , that @xmath41 and @xmath42 have to vanish as well .",
    "although our analysis of the junction conditions at the interface allows for other possibilities , our numerical calculations assume that the phase transition that leads to the formation of superfluid neutrons is second order .",
    "in other words , we consider the energy density to be continuous at @xmath43 . from the analysis presented in appendix  i",
    ", we see that the two metric coefficients and the pressure must then also be continuous .",
    "we will also assume that the proton number density and the proton chemical potential are continuous at the interface .",
    "at the surface , we will only consider configurations that satisfy @xmath44 . a smooth joining of the interior spacetime to a schwarzschild vacuum exterior at the surface of the star implies that the total mass @xmath45 of the system is given by m = - 4 ^r_0 r^2  ( r ) dr and that @xmath46 .      it is well - known that all non - trivial pulsation modes of a nonrotating fluid star correspond to polar pertubations ( often referred to as `` even parity '' ) .",
    "in the so - called regge - wheeler gauge @xcite , the corresponding metric components are g _ = - e^i t p_l ( )  .",

    "such a change would not have affected our discussion or the implications of our results in any way .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this does not , however , mean that we should give up on the main idea behind this analysis .",
    "we simply have to acknowledge that we are likely to require significant improvements in technology if we are to be able to make this into a viable approach .",
    "but it seems inevitable that the available technology will improve over the next decades .",
    "in fact , various groups are already discussing possible improvements in detector sensitivity that may be achievable in the future . in order to illustrate the levels that are being discussed , we consider the so - called euro detector , for which the sensitivity has been estimated by sathyaprakash and schutz ( for further details see @xcite ) .",
    "we consider two possible configurations : in the first , the sensitivity at high frequencies is limited by the photon shot - noise , while the second configuration reaches beyond this limit by running several narrowbanded ( cryogenic ) interferometers as a `` xylophone '' .",
    "the corresponding noise - curves are illustrated , and compared to the current generation of interferometers , in figure  [ figure1 ] .",
    "it is immediately clear from figure  [ figure1 ] that a euro detector would be a superb instrument for studying pulsating neutron stars .",
    "this means that previously suggested strategies @xcite for unveiling the supranuclear equation of state may eventually be put to the test .",
    "in fact , as is clear from the estimates in table  [ ftab ] , where we list the signal - to - noise ratio estimated from ( [ sign ] ) , one should also be able to detect the superfluid oscillation modes .",
    "the various modes would be marginally detectable given this level of excitation and a third generation detector limited by the photon shotnoise .",
    "if this limit can be surpassed by configuring several narrowbanded interferometers as a xylophone , the achievable signal - to - noise ratio will be excellent .",
    "hence , it seems plausible that one could infer the parameters of neutron star superfluidity . as an obvious `` by product '' one might hope to shed light on the mechanism for pulsar glitches .",
    "we can also confirm that , provided that the modes can be detected , the oscillation frequencies can be extracted with good accuracy from the data . by combining eqns .",
    "( 11 ) and ( 12 ) from kokkotas et al @xcite with ( [ sign ] ) one can obtain a formula for the signal - to - noise required to determine the mode frequency with a relative error @xmath134 .",
    "we get ( since @xmath135 for the modes under consideration ) a relation ( s n ) 0.33 ( 1 t_d ) ( f ) ( _ f f ) ^-1 from this relation we can deduce that a detection with signal - to - noise of ( say ) 10 would enable one to infer the fluid mode frequencies with an accuracy of the order of a percent or so . with this level of precision",
    "one should be able to distinguish clearly between the `` normal fluid '' f and p - modes and the superfluid s - modes .",
    "in other words , we would have the information required not only to infer the mass and radius of the star @xcite , we could also hope to constrain the parameters of neutron star superfluidity .",
    "the main motivation behind the work presented in this paper is the fact that neutron star physics is not adequately modelled within newtonian gravity .",
    "it is well known that newtonian results differ greatly from the correct relativistic ones already at the level of determining the mass and radius of a star with a prescribed central density from a given `` realistic '' equation of state . as far as the qnms of the star",
    "are concerned , newtonian studies are extremely useful since they help us understand the physics of different classes of modes .",
    "but at the same time it is clear that if we require a detailed model of the oscillation spectrum of an astrophysical neutron star we must approach the problem from the relativistic point of view .",
    "this is particularly crucial if we are interested in the gravitational - wave damping rates .",
    "furthermore , since mature neutron stars are likely to contain several superfluid components , it is important that we develop a framework for modelling multi - fluid systems in full general relativity .",
    "the present paper represents significant progress towards this goal .",
    "we have considered a core - envelope model , with superfluid neutrons being present only in the core of the star while the outer region is composed of an ordinary fluid .",
    "our model includes a simple , yet reasonable , model for entrainment and we have shown how neighbouring qnms undergo avoided crossings as the entrainment parameter is varied . finally , we have ruled out the possibility that a two - fluid star could have non - radiative pulsation modes , and discussed the possible detection of gravitational - wave signals from oscillating superfluid neutron stars .    in the near future , our aim is to turn our attention to the oscillations of rotating superfluid stars .",
    "this is an exciting problem area , since various modes of oscillation may be driven unstable by the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "of particular recent interest are the so - called r - modes , and the damping due to superfluid mutual friction . in a recent work , lindblom and",
    "mendell @xcite showed that mutual friction was effective at damping unstable r - modes only for very particular values of the entrainment parameter .",
    "andersson and comer @xcite have speculated that this peculiar behavior might be due to the existence of avoided crossings between two classes of r - modes ( analogous to the two classes of acoustic fluid modes discussed in the present paper ) .",
    "the results of the present paper lend support to this idea .",
    "yet it is clear that our understanding of the various involved issues is far from complete , and that a considerable amount of work remains to be done before we can model the dynamics of rotating superfluid neutron stars in a `` realistic '' way .",

    "one finally obtains for the entrainment variable x^2 = ( 1 - _ i j ( u_^i / c ) ( v_^j / c ) )  .",

    "this basic fact will be at the heart of the expansion considered below .",
    "given what was just discussed , it makes sense to consider equations of state that can be expanded like ( n^2,p^2,x^2 ) = _ i = 0^ _ i(n^2,p^2 ) ( x^2 - ) ^i  , since @xmath109 is small with respect to @xmath110 . in terms of this expansion , one can show the following for the @xmath74 , @xmath75 , etc .",
    "coefficients that appear in the field equations : @xmath168 it is important to note that @xmath75 vanishes if the master function is such that @xmath169 are separable in @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the utility of this expansion is especially apparent for the quasinormal mode calculations , because when any of the coefficients are evaluated on the background , then one sets @xmath35 , and thus only the first few @xmath169 are needed .",
    "in fact , in our analysis we only retain @xmath170 and @xmath119 , where the latter contains the information concerning the entrainment effect .",
    "the problem of calculating quasinormal modes of relativistic systems , such as black holes and neutron stars , is in many ways far from trivial . in general",
    ", a strategy for finding qnms has to involve a prescription for imposing a pure outgoing wave boundary condition at infinity for a linear second - order differential equation . in the context of the present paper",
    "the relevant equation is the one derived by zerilli @xcite : z = 0  .",
    "[ zerilli ] here @xmath171 is the standard tortoise coordinate and we have assumed that the perturbed quantities have a harmonic dependence on time , i.e. behave as @xmath172 .",
    "the effective potential @xmath173 is rather complicated but here we need only know that it is such that the behaviour of a general solution at spatial infinity ( as @xmath174 ) is z ~a_out ( ) e^-ir _ + a_in ( ) e^ir _  .    a qnm of the system is a solution that combines some physical constraints ( no waves coming out of the event horizon in the case of a black hole or a regular solution to the equations for the interior of a star ) with purely outgoing waves , @xmath175 , at infinity .",
    "two typical difficulties arise in the determination of such mode solutions .",
    "both are due to the fact that the qnms are damped by gravitational radiation emission , and thus the qnm frequency @xmath176 must be complex ( with a positive imaginary part unless the mode is unstable ) .",
    "this means that an outgoing - wave solution to eq .",
    "( [ zerilli ] ) will be exponentially growing as @xmath174 and one would , in principle , need exponentially high numerical precision to discard the ingoing solution .",
    "this problem is particularly challenging for rapidly damped modes , like those of black holes and the neutron star w - modes .",
    "a second difficulty that arises is relevant for the p - modes of a neutron stars .",
    "the high order p - modes are damped very slowly by gravitational radiation .",
    "thus , the characteristic frequencies are such that the imaginary part is many orders of magnitude smaller than the real part .",
    "although not as conceptually challenging as the first qnm problem , the difficulty associated with extremely small imaginary parts typically prohibits the determination of any but the first few of the neutron star p - modes . in this appendix",
    ", we describe a new method for dealing with this problem .",
    "the various mode results presented in the main body of the paper were obtained within this scheme .",
    "let us assume that our relativistic system has a qnm with complex frequency @xmath176 .",
    "then the solution to the zerilli equation is such that @xmath177 as @xmath178 whereas @xmath179 asymptotically .",
    "from the fact that it is the frequency squared that appears in all the relevant perturbation equations ( see sec .",
    "[ eqns ] ) we can draw two general conclusions : i ) another outgoing - wave mode is characterized by @xmath180 ( where the bar represents complex conjugation ) , and ii ) time - reversal of an outgoing - wave mode leads to a solution that corresponds to purely ingoing waves at infinity .",
    "that is , a solution such that , at infinity , @xmath181 while @xmath182 .",
    "moreover , it follows that a second such solution corresponds to @xmath183 . as we will demonstrate below",
    ", this information can be very useful when trying to identify normal - mode frequencies that have small imaginary parts .",
    "most schemes for determining qnms are based on numerical constructions of the ratio @xmath184 . assuming that a_in ( ) ~(-_n ) close to a qnm one can try to iterate for the zero of @xmath185 using a standard scheme such as mller s method .",
    "this strategy works fine for rapidly damped modes ( and typically also for the fluid f - mode ) , but does usually not provide a reliable estimate for an imaginary part that is several orders of magnitude smaller than the real part .",
    "an alternative method is inspired by resonant scattering problems in quantum theory .",
    "letting @xmath186 ( with @xmath187 and @xmath188 both positive ) we can easily identify the real part @xmath187 from the position of the minimum of the standard `` breit - wigner resonance '' in a graph of @xmath189 , cf .  the example shown in fig .",
    "[ ainfig ] .",
    "it is not all that simple to extract the imaginary part , however . to do",
    "this one must approximate the half - width of the peak , eg .  by curve fitting .",
    "to achieve satisfactory precision in this process is not trivial .     vs the real part of the frequency .",
    "in the left panel we see a standard `` breit - wigner resonance . ''",
    "the right panel illustrates the properties of the phase of the ration of the asymptotic amplitudes .",
    "we use the location of the two poles and zeros to deduce the frequency and damping rate of a long - lived pulsation mode.,height=264 ]    to devise a better scheme for determining the damping rate of a very long - lived qnm , we employ the two general properties we deduced earlier . from these",
    "it is clear that , if we have a zero of @xmath185 close to the real frequency axis , there must also be a zero of @xmath190 on the opposite side of the axis .",
    "how does that alter the above results ?",
    "close to a zero of @xmath190 we will have a_out ( ) ~(-|_n )  .",
    "then we immediately see that the absolute value of the ratio between the asymptotic amplitudes , @xmath191 , is a smooth , slowly varying function of the frequency .",
    "but if we consider its phase , we find some interesting and useful features .",
    "we get ( for real @xmath73 ) where @xmath192 is a complex `` constant , '' and therefore  . from this",
    "we see that , instead of having a singularity at @xmath193 we now have a function with two zeros and two poles on the real frequency axis , cf .",
    "[ ainfig ] . provided that the calculation of the asymptotic amplitudes can be done with sufficiently high precision , the location of these zeros ( @xmath194 ) and poles ( @xmath195 ) can readily be deduced .",
    "given this information one can show that @xmath196^{1/2 }       \\\\      { \\gamma_r \\over \\gamma_i } & \\approx & { 2 \\beta_n \\over p_1 + p_1 - 2       \\alpha_n } = { 1 \\over 2 \\beta_n } [ 2 \\alpha_n - z_1 - z_2 ] \\",
    ".\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it should be pointed out that one gets four equations for the real and imaginary parts of the qnm frequency , as well as the ratio @xmath197 .",
    "the last equality above can therefore be used as a `` sanity check '' on the calculation .",
    "in essence , it provides information about the accuracy of the obtained quantitites .",
