    "the value of @xmath35 ( the landau level degeneracy ) is equal to the total flux through the sample , @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 is the area ) , divided by the quantum of flux @xmath38 .",
    "the filling factor @xmath39 is defined as the ratio of the number of electrons , @xmath40 , to @xmath35 .",
    "when @xmath39 has an integral value , an infinitesimal decrease in the area @xmath37 requires promotion of an electron across the cyclotron gap @xmath0 to the first unoccupied landau level , making the system incompressible .",
    "this incompressibility together with the existence of both localized and extended states in the system is responsible for the observed behavior of the magneto - conductivity of quantum hall systems at integral filling factors @xcite .    in order to construct a many electron wavefunction @xmath41 corresponding to a completely filled lowest landau level , the product function which places one electron in each of the @xmath42 orbitals @xmath43 ( @xmath22 , 1 ,  , @xmath34 ) must be antisymmetrized .",
    "this can be done with the aid of a slater determinant @xmath44 the determinant in equation  ( [ eq4 ] ) is the well - known vandemonde determinant .",

    "laughlin noticed that if the factor @xmath47 arising from the vandemonde determinant was replaced by @xmath48 , where @xmath5 was an integer , the wavefunction @xmath49 would be antisymmetric , keep the electrons further apart ( and therefore reduce the coulomb repulsion ) , and correspond to a filling factor @xmath50 .",

    "the cs transformation can be thought of as an attachment to each particle of flux tube carrying a fictitious flux @xmath142 ( where @xmath38 is the quantum of flux ) and a fictitious charge @xmath114 which couples in the standard way to the vector potential caused by the flux tubes on every other particle .",
    "the @xmath143 is interpreted as the vector potential at position @xmath144 due to a magnetic flux of strength @xmath142 localized at @xmath145 , and @xmath146 is the total vector potential at position @xmath144 due to all cs fluxes .",
    "the cs magnetic field associated with the particle at @xmath145 is @xmath147 .",
    "because two charged particles can not occupy the same position , one particle never senses the magnetic field of other particles , but it does sense the vector potential resulting from their cs fluxes .",

    "the hamiltonian for the composite particle system ( charged particles with attached flux tubes ) is much more complicated than the original system with @xmath152 .",
    "what is gained by making the cs transformation ?",
    "the answer is that one can use the `` mean field '' approximation in which @xmath153 , the vector potential of the external plus cs magnetic fields , is replaced by @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the mean field value of @xmath146 obtained by simply replacing @xmath156 by its average value @xmath157 in equation  ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "a mean field energy spectrum can be constructed in which the massive degeneracy of the original partially filled electron landau level disappears .",
    "one might then hope to treat both the coulomb interaction and the cs gauge field interactions among the fluctuations ( beyond the mean field ) by standard many body perturbation techniques ( e.g. by the random phase approximation , rpa ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is no small parameter for a many body perturbation expansion unless @xmath97 , the number of cs flux quanta attached to each particle , is small compared to unity .",
    "however , a landau ",
    "silin @xcite type fermi liquid approach can take account of the short range correlations phenomenologically .",
    "a number of excellent papers on anyon superconductivity @xcite treat cs gauge interactions by standard many body techniques .",
    "halperin and collaborators @xcite have treated the half filled landau level as a liquid of composite fermions moving in zero effective magnetic field .",
    "their rpa  fermi - liquid approach gives a surprisingly satisfactory account of the properties of that state .    the vector potential associated with fluctuations beyond the mean field",
    "is given by @xmath158 .",
    "the perturbation to the mean field hamiltonian contains both linear and quadratic terms in @xmath159 , resulting in both two body  containing @xmath160  and three body  containing @xmath161  interaction terms .",
    "the three body interaction terms are usually ignored , though for @xmath97 of the order of unity this approximation is of questionable validity .",
    "jain noted that in the mean field approximation , an effective filling factor @xmath162 of the composite fermions was related to the electron filling factor @xmath39 by the relation @xmath163 remember that @xmath164 is equal to the number of flux quanta of the applied magnetic field per electron , and @xmath165 is the ( even ) number of cs flux quanta ( oriented opposite to the applied magnetic field ) attached to each electron in the cs transformation .",

    "this leads to the set of equations : @xmath439 where @xmath440 is the qp filling factor and @xmath441 is the number of flux quanta attached to each fermion at the @xmath85th level of the cf hierarchy .",

    "there are others where it is clearly in complete disagreement with numerical results .",

    "it is apparent that the set of multiplets at @xmath110 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 form the low energy band .",
    "however the reapplication of the mean field cf transformation to the three qe s in the @xmath461 shell ( which predicts an @xmath110 incompressible ground state corresponding to @xmath469 ) is definitely wrong .",

    "the electron ( coulomb ) pseudopotential in the lowest landau level @xmath470 satisfies the `` short range '' criterion ( i.e. it increases more quickly with decreasing @xmath249 than the harmonic pseudopotential @xmath320 ) in the entire range of @xmath249 , which is the reason for the incompressibility of the principal laughlin @xmath50 states .",
    "however , this does not generally hold for the qp pseudopotentials on higher levels of the hierarchy . in figure  [ fig8 ]",
    "we plotted @xmath471 and @xmath472 for the @xmath108 and @xmath410 laughlin states of six to eleven electrons .",

    "the convergence of energies at small @xmath249 obtained for larger @xmath40 suggests that the maxima at @xmath300 for qe s and at @xmath248 and 5 for qh s , as well as the minima at @xmath248 and 5 for qe s and at @xmath300 and 7 for qh s , persist in the limit of large @xmath40 ( i.e. for an infinite system on a plane ) .",
    "consequently , the only incompressible daughter states of laughlin @xmath108 and 1/5 states are those with @xmath473 or @xmath474 and ( maybe ) @xmath475 and @xmath476 .",
    "it is clear that no incompressible daughter states of the parent laughlin @xmath108 state will form at e.g. @xmath469 ( @xmath477 ) or 4/13 ( @xmath478 ) , but that they will form ( at least , in finite systems @xcite ) at @xmath457 ( @xmath475 ) or 4/13 ( @xmath476 ) .    from the cf hierarchy scheme we find the jain  laughlin states when the cs transformation is applied directly to electrons ( or to holes in a more than half - filled level ) .",
    "these states occur at integral values of @xmath162 , the effective cf filling factor , and correspond to completely filling a qp shell . for example , the @xmath60 state occurs when @xmath207 , and the cf s in the first excited shell ( which are laughlin qe s of the @xmath108 state ) have @xmath479 .",
    "the angular momenta of the two lowest cf shells are @xmath480 and @xmath481 , so they contain @xmath482 and @xmath483 states , respectively .",
    "since @xmath479 , there are @xmath484 cf quasiparticles .",
    "the total number of states filled by the @xmath40 fermions is @xmath485 , giving @xmath486 . for an infinite system",
    "this is just haldane s relation between the number of quasiparticles and the number of electrons , @xmath487 , for the integer @xmath488 .",
    "this demonstrates that integrally filled cf shells correspond to @xmath479 , a completely filled shell of laughlin qp s . adding new fermions to a system with @xmath479 requires creating a new type of qp s , and the counting of available qp states turns out to be exactly the same in the cf hierarchy and haldane s boson hierarchy picrures .",
    "integral cf filling ( i.e. , @xmath479 ) gives a valid mean field picture independent of qp  qp interactions provided that the gap for creating new qp s is positive .",
    "when @xmath162 is non - integral , the mean field picture is valid only at values of @xmath2 for which the `` short range '' requirement on the pseudopotential @xmath489 is satisfied .",
    "the form of the qp  qp interactions obtained from our numerical calculations makes it clear that the mean field approximation is not valid at certain quasiparticle fillings ( e.g. for @xmath490 filling of the quasielectron levels of the electron @xmath108 state ) .",
    "there has been a great deal of interest in photoluminescence ( pl ) of 2d systems in high magnetic fields . an important ingredient in understanding",
    "pl is the negatively charged exciton ( @xmath491 ) .",
    "the @xmath491 consists of two electrons bound to a valence band hole .",
    "if the total spin of the pair of electrons , @xmath492 , is zero , the @xmath491 is said to be a singlet ( @xmath493 ) ; if @xmath494 the @xmath491 is called a triplet ( @xmath495 ) .",
    "only the @xmath493 is bound in the absence of a magnetic field , but in infinite magnetic field ( so that only a single landau level is relevant ) only the @xmath495 is bound in a 2d system .",
    "it often occurs that the photoexcited hole is separated from the plane of the electron system by a small distance ( this can happen , e.g. , in wide gaas quantum wells when the electron gas is confined to one gaas / algaas interface by remote ionized donors , and the photoexcited holes reside close to the other gaas / algaas interface ) .",
    "several remarkable effects associated with electron ",
    "hole systems and charged excitons can be understood using the composite fermion picture .",
    "first let us consider the idealized 2d system at so large a magnetic field that only the lowest electron and hole landau levels need be considered . the energy spectrum for a two - electron  one - hole system at @xmath496",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig12 ] .    ' '' ''    = 3.75 in    the triplet @xmath491 with angular momentum @xmath497 is the only bound state , with binding energy @xmath408 .",
    "a pair of ( unbound ) singlet and triplet states occur at the energy equal exactly to the exciton energy @xmath498 . in these",
    "so - called `` multiplicative '' states a neutral exciton @xmath499 in its ground state is decoupled from the second electron .",
    "addition of exciton and electron angular momenta @xmath500 and @xmath501 gives a state of total angular momentum @xmath502 , and addition of two electron spins of @xmath503 gives both @xmath504 and 1 spin configurations .",
    "the occurrence of unbound states at @xmath505 and @xmath502 is a manifestation of the following `` hidden symmetry : '' because of the exact overlap of electron and hole orbitals in the lowest landau level ( scaled with the same magnetic length @xmath7 ) , and thus independence of the strength of interaction of the type of particles involved , the commutator of an operator @xmath506 that creates an exciton in its @xmath500 ground state ( on a sphere , @xmath507 , where @xmath92 and @xmath508 are electron and hole creation operators ) , with the interaction hamiltonian @xmath509 is @xmath510=e_xd_x^\\dagger$ ] . as a result , if @xmath511 is an eigenstate of @xmath63 electrons and @xmath512 holes with an eigenenergy @xmath513 and angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath2 and @xmath96 , then the multiplicative state @xmath514 of @xmath515 electrons and @xmath516 holes is also an eigenstate with energy @xmath517 and the same @xmath2 and @xmath96 . a good quantum number conserved due to the `` hidden symmetry '' is the number of decoupled excitons , @xmath518 .",
    "in particular , the ground state for @xmath519 is the totally multiplicative state @xmath520 with @xmath521 ; for an infinite system this ground state can be viewed as a bose condensate of non - interacting excitons .",
    "it can be readily found that the application of the pl operator that annihilates an optically active exciton ( @xmath522 ) reduces its @xmath518 by one , and therefore that only the multiplicative electron ",

    "the @xmath493 and @xmath636 ( @xmath637 for `` bright '' ) , the lowest singlet and triplet states at @xmath502 , are the only well bound radiative states , while @xmath638 ( @xmath602 for `` dark '' ) has by far the lowest energy of all non - radiative ( @xmath639 ) states .",
    "the dark triplet state @xmath638 is the state discussed in the preceding sections ; it is the only bound state in the lowest landau level , but unbinds at low magnetic fields .",
    "the bright singlet state @xmath493 is the only bound state at @xmath635 , but unbinds at very high fields due to the hidden symmetry .",
    "these states cross at @xmath640  t , as predicted in an earlier calculation @xcite .",
    "the bright triplet state @xmath636 has been discovered very recently @xcite .",
    "it occurs only at intermediate fields and does not cross neither @xmath493 or @xmath638 .",
    "it has larger pl intensity than the @xmath493 state .",
    "although an isolated @xmath638 is non - radiative because of the angular momentum selection rule , its collisions with other @xmath491 s or with electrons ( which break the translational symmetry ) could be expected to allow for @xmath638 recombination . however , the laughlin correlations limit high energy collisions at low filling density ( @xmath641 or less ) and the pl intensity of a dark @xmath638 remains very low also in a presence of other particles @xcite . in consequence ,",
    "the @xmath638 is not seen in pl , and there is no contradiction between experiment @xcite , which sees recombination of a triplet state at the energy above the singlet state up to 50  t , and theory @xcite , which predicts that the lowest triplet state crosses the singlet at roughly 30  t.",
    "we have introduced the jain cf mean field picture and shown how the low lying states can be understood by simple addition of angular momentum .",
    "the mean field cf picture gives the correct spectral structure not because of some cancellation between chern  simons and coulomb interactions beyond the mean field , but because it selects a low angular momentum subset of the allowed multiplets that avoids the largest pair repulsion .",
    "the laughlin correlations , which describe incompressible quantum fluid states , depend critically on the electron pseudopotential being of `` short range '' ( by which we mean that @xmath316 increases more quickly than @xmath254 ) .",
    "the validity of jain s picture also depends upon @xmath316 being of short range .",
    "the pseudopotential describing quasiparticles of a laughlin condensed state display short range behavior only at certain values of @xmath245 .",
    "we have used this fact to explain why only certain states in the cf hierarchy give rise to incompressible states of the quasiparticle fluid ( or daughter states in the hierarchy ) .",
    "the pseudopotentials @xmath364 for higher landau levels ( @xmath642 ) do not display short range behavior at all values of @xmath245 , implying that laughlin - like correlations will not necessarily result at @xmath643 , where @xmath5 is an integer and @xmath39 is a laughlin  jain filling factor .",
    "the cf ideas have been applied successfully to multicomponent plasmas containing different types of fermions with the prediction of possible incompressible fluid states for these systems . finally , the energy spectrum and pl of electron  hole systems can be interpreted in terms of cf s and laughlin correlations .",
