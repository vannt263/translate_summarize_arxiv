    "the distribution of wealth among individuals in an economy has been an important area of research in economics , for more than a hundred years  @xcite .",
    "the same is true for income distribution in any society .",
    "detailed analysis of the income distribution  @xcite so far indicate @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the number density of people with income or wealth @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 denote exponents and @xmath5 denotes a scaling factor . the power law in income and wealth distribution ( for @xmath6 )",
    "is named after pareto and the exponent @xmath4 is called the pareto exponent . a historical account of pareto s data and that from recent sources can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . the crossover point ( @xmath7 )",
    "is extracted from the crossover from a gamma distribution form to the power law tail .",
    "one often fits the region below @xmath7 to a log - normal form @xmath8 .",
    "although this form is often preferred by economists , we think that the other gamma distribution form eqn .",
    "( [ par ] ) fits better with the data , because of the remarkable fit with the gibbs distribution in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "considerable investigations revealed that the tail of the income distribution indeed follows the above mentioned behavior and the value of the pareto exponent @xmath4 is generally seen to vary between 1 and 3  @xcite .",
    "it is also known that typically less than @xmath9 of the population in any country possesses about @xmath10 of the total wealth of that country and they follow the above law , while the rest of the low income population , follow a different distribution which is debated to be either gibbs  @xcite or log - normal  @xcite .",
    "the striking regularities observed in the income distribution for different countries , have led to several new attempts at explaining them on theoretical grounds .",
    "much of it is from physicists modeling of economic behavior in analogy with large systems of interacting particles , as treated , e.g. , in the kinetic theory of gases .",
    "according to physicists , the regular patterns observed in the income ( and wealth ) distribution may be indicative of a natural law for the statistical properties of a many - body dynamical system representing the entire set of economic interactions in a society , analogous to those previously derived for gases and liquids . by viewing the economy as a thermodynamic system",
    ", one can identify the income distribution with the distribution of energy among the particles in a gas .",
    "in particular , a class of kinetic exchange models have provided a simple mechanism for understanding the unequal accumulation of assets .",
    "many of these models , while simple from the perspective of economics , has the benefit of coming to grips with the key factor in socioeconomic interactions that results in very different societies converging to similar forms of unequal distribution of resources ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , which consists of a collection of large number of technical papers in this field ) .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a new model of asset exchange on a directed network and investigate the nature of wealth distribution , using numerical simulations . in sec .",

    "[ sec : dirnet ] , we propose the new model and present the results . we conclude with discussions in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "in analogy to two - particle collision process which results in a change in their individual kinetic energy or momenta , income exchange models may be defined using two - agent interactions : two randomly selected agents exchange money by some pre - defined mechanism . assuming the exchange process does not depend on previous exchanges , the dynamics follows a markovian process : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the income of ( individual or corporate ) agent @xmath13 at time @xmath14 and the collision matrix @xmath15 defines the exchange mechanism .    in this class of models ,",
    "one considers a closed economic system where the total money @xmath16 and number of agents @xmath17 is fixed .",
    "this corresponds to no production or migration in the system where the only economic activity is confined to trading . in any trading ,",
    "a pair of traders @xmath13 and @xmath18 exchange their money @xcite , such that their total money is locally conserved and nobody ends up with negative money ( @xmath19 , i.e , debt not allowed ) : @xmath20 time ( @xmath14 ) changes by one unit after each trading .",
    "the simplest model considers a random fraction of total money to be shared  @xcite . at steady - state",
    "( @xmath21 ) money follows a gibbs distribution : @xmath22 ; @xmath23 , independent of the initial distribution .",
    "this follows from the conservation of money and additivity of entropy : @xmath24 this result is quite robust and is independent of the topology of the ( undirected ) exchange space , be it regular lattice , fractal or small - world  @xcite .",
    "a saving propensity factor @xmath25 was introduced in the random exchange model  @xcite , where each trader at time @xmath14 saves a fraction @xmath25 of its money @xmath26 and trades randomly with the rest : @xmath27,\\ ] ] @xmath28,\\ ] ] @xmath29 being a random fraction , coming from the stochastic nature of the trading .    in this model ( cc model hereafter ) , the steady state distribution @xmath30 of money is decaying on both sides with the most - probable money per agent shifting away from @xmath31 ( for @xmath32 ) to @xmath33 as @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "this model has been understood to a certain extent  @xcite and argued to resemble a gamma distribution  @xcite .",
    "but , the actual form of the distribution for this model still remains to be found out .",
    "it seems that a very similar model was proposed by angle  @xcite several years back in sociology journals .",
    "the numerical simulation results of angle s model fit well to gamma distributions .",
    "empirical observations in homogeneous groups of individuals as in waged income of factory labourers in uk and usa  @xcite and data from population survey in usa among students of different school and colleges produce similar distributions  @xcite .",
    "this is a simple case where a homogeneous population ( say , characterized by a unique value of @xmath25 ) has been identified .    in a real society or economy , saving @xmath25 is a very inhomogeneous parameter .",
    "the evolution of money in a corresponding trading model ( ccm model hereafter ) can be written as  @xcite : @xmath35,\\ ] ] @xmath36\\ ] ] the trading rules are same as cc model , except that @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the saving propensities of agents @xmath13 and @xmath18 , are different .",

    "this is valid for all such distributions , unless @xmath44 , when @xmath45  @xcite . in the ccm model ,",
    "agents with higher saving propensity tend to hold higher average wealth , which is justified by the fact that the saving propensity in the rich population is always high  @xcite",
    ". analytical understanding of ccm model has been possible until now under certain approximations  @xcite , and mean - field theory  @xcite . unlike the above models with savings as a quenched disorder",

    "a mean field scenario does not take into account the constraints on the flow of money or wealth .",
    "in other words , there are strong notions of directionality and sometimes , hierarchy in the underlying network , where money is preferentially transeferred in certain direction that others , contributing in irreversible flow of money . a way to imitate this is to consider wealth exchange models on a directed network  @xcite .",
