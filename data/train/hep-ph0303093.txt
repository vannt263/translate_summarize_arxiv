    "a pair of spin - less charged higgs bosons , @xmath2 ( with mass @xmath10 ) , arises in any two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) alongside a trio of neutral higgs bosons  the @xmath11-even ` light ' @xmath12 and ` heavy ' @xmath13 ( _ i.e. _ , with @xmath14 ) scalars and the @xmath11-odd pseudoscalar @xmath15 ( with mass @xmath16 ) . embedding a type ii 2hdm inside the attractive theoretical framework provided by supersymmetry ( susy ) yields the mssm ( see @xcite ) , wherein the particle content is limited to the known sm states ( fermions and gauge bosons ) , their ` sparticle ' counterparts ( sfermions and gauginos ) plus the five aforementioned higgs bosons and their respective higgsinos . among the new massive sparticles predicted in the mssm are the charginos and the neutralinos , which are the mass eigenstate mixtures of the electroweak ( ew ) gauginos and the higgsinos .",
    "previous papers @xcite have demonstrated that @xmath2 decays into a chargino and a neutralino can probe regions of the mssm parameter space where charged higgs boson decays into sm particles and other higgs bosons are swamped by backgrounds . in particular , @xmath1 ( the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the up - type and down - type higgs doublets ) values between @xmath17 and @xmath18 were found to be in part accessible via @xmath19 decay modes ( _ i.e. _ , charged higgs boson decays into the lightest chargino and the second or third heaviest neutralino ) , when the final state includes three leptons ( meaning electrons and/or muons ) ( or @xmath20 ) production process , and via substantial missing transverse momentum from the lightest neutralinos , @xmath21s , the stable lightest supersymmetric particles ( lsps ) which must eventually result from decays of the inos . ] .",
    "such @xmath1 values fall in the so - called ` intermediate ' regime wherein @xmath2 decays to sm objects ( which may include neutral mssm higgs bosons ) are undetectable at the lhc irrespective of the values chosen for other mssm input parameters ) .",
    "in fact , the one neutral higgs boson that may be detectable typically mimics a sm higgs boson ( this is the so - called ` decoupling scenario ' ) . ] .",
    "this zone of undetectability , in part due to the @xmath22 coupling of the main @xmath23 production mode - containing events if these strongly - interacting sparticles are light enough to be abundantly produced . however , such events may also fail to contain a top quark or possess an excessive number of jets and so not satisfy our signal requirements . here",
    "we neglect such production processes . ] , begins around @xmath24 or @xmath25 for @xmath26 and spreads to encompass more and more @xmath1 values ( say , between @xmath17 and @xmath27 ) as @xmath10 grows larger .",
    "the rate suppression may be further exacerbated by the same @xmath1 dependence in the @xmath28 decays if there are other competing decay channels  naturally , if the @xmath28 branching ratio ( br ) is @xmath29 , it will remain so and there is no additional suppression because of the bottom - top decay rate .",
    "the alternative mssm decay channel @xmath30 , which also yields @xmath31 intermediate states ( since @xmath32 ) , is only relevant within a minuscule @xmath1 interval ( roughly @xmath33 ) for @xmath34  this lies close to the lep2 s excluded region .",
    "then there is @xmath35 , which is limited to larger @xmath1 values mode has a much reduced scope in comparison , because of the large qcd background .",
    "] , at best offering coverage down to @xmath36 for @xmath26 and contracting to even higher @xmath1 values as @xmath10 grows larger @xcite .",
    "( see references in @xcite for a list of phenomenological analyses of these sm decay modes of a charged higgs boson . )    considering such limitations , it is worthwhile pursuing further the @xmath37 inos decay modes initially probed in @xcite , expanding upon the results found therein and placing the analysis in a sounder phenomenological context .",
    "the improvements found herein go in three general directions .",
    "firstly , the allowable parameter space is covered far more thoroughly , incorporating all possible chargino - neutralino decay modes into the analysis and including every conceivable path leading from a charged higgs boson to a three leptons plus invisible energy final state .",
    "secondly , investigation of the rle of on- and off - shell sleptons ( the susy partners of the leptons ) is considerably deepened : as noted in the previous studies , if there is a light slepton , the leptonic brs of the inos can be significantly enhanced ( especially those of @xmath38 and/or @xmath39 ) .",
    "thirdly , signals are herein studied within a full event generator environment modelling the cms detector and also includes an improved background analysis that encompasses potential mssm background processes ( @xcite was a very preliminary account in both these respects while @xcite only considered sm backgrounds and was carried out solely at the parton level ) .    the legacy of the cern @xmath40 collider is a model independent limit on @xmath10 from charged higgs pair production of order @xmath41  @xmath42 is the current lep2 bound @xcite .",
    "further , the current lower higgs boson mass bound of approximately @xmath43 @xcite can be converted within the mssm into a minimal value for @xmath44 of @xmath45@xmath46 , for @xmath47@xmath48 .",
    "this bound grows rapidly stronger as @xmath49 is decreased while tapering very gradually as @xmath49 is increased ( staying in the @xmath50@xmath51 interval for @xmath52 ) . for @xmath53 , charged higgs bosons could be discovered during run 2 of the fnal tevatron @xcite , which has already begun taking data at @xmath54 , by exploiting their production in top and antitop quark decays ( @xmath55 ) followed by @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath57 ( our definition of a ` heavy ' charged higgs boson ) , one will necessarily have to wait until the advent of the lhc at cern , with @xmath58 , and thus this study will concentrate upon charged higgs boson masses well above that of the top ( anti)quark . this will also provide ample phase space to allow for decays into sparticles with masses above current experimental bounds .",
    "there are also other processes where charged higgs bosons ( or @xmath59 , to whose mass that of the @xmath2 is closely tied ) enter as virtual particles at the one - loop level .",
    "these include neutral meson mixing ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 or @xmath62 ) and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) @xcite , @xmath65 decays @xcite , @xmath66 decays @xcite and the anomalous muon magnetic dipole moment @xcite .",
    "the @xmath65 decays are generally thought to be the most constraining @xcite ( @xmath66 becomes significant for very high values of @xmath1 ) . in the mssm , one - loop diagrams with either a @xmath2@xmath67 loop or a @xmath68@xmath69 can give meaningful contributions to @xmath65 decay processes ( loops involving gluinos are not significant if gluinos are relatively heavy ) , and these two contributions may come either with the same or with opposite signs . thus @xmath65 restrictions on @xmath44 are linked to the masses of the lighter chargino and the stops .",
    "the @xmath65 decays and the other higher order processes may well exclude some regions of the mssm parameter space that are still allowed by the more direct limits from higgs boson and sparticle searches at lep2 . however , definite bounds are quite difficult to delineate without restricting oneself to some subset of the allowed parameter space of the general mssm by specifying a mechanism for how susy is to be broken ( and in general linking together what in the general mssm are independent input parameters ) . studies which have delineated excluded regions resulting from these processes have invariably included additional assumptions about the behaviour of the theory at higher energy scales  such as in minimal supergravity ( msugra ) for example , for which next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations have recently been performed @xcite .",
    "there are also significant uncertainties in translating the experimental results into clear predictions about mssm parameters @xcite .",
    "concerning limits from recent @xmath70 measurements , these are most restrictive @xcite when @xmath1 is low ( @xmath71 )  a case which is not of particular interest for our process  and may be relaxed when smuons are light  a case which is of particular interest for our process .",
    "analysing the usefulness of @xmath37 chargino - neutralino decays within the general mssm parameter space is a fairly involved undertaking since many independent input parameters associated with just about all the ( s)particle sectors of the model can play crucial rles . from the higgs sector",
    "we of course have @xmath1 along with one input higgs boson mass , taken herein as @xmath16 , to which the tree - level masses of all the other higgs bosons are pegged .",
    "these two inputs are largely sufficient for the sm decay modes , assuming sparticle decay modes are closed .",
    "squark masses , particularly stop masses , can drive significant radiative corrections to the tree - level higgs boson masses , especially to @xmath72 .",
    "in contrast , higher order corrections to the tree - level relation @xmath73 are typically quite small @xcite .",
    "thus the signal rate is insensitive to the choice of squark - sector inputs .",
    "nevertheless , the coloured - sparticle sector affects the analysis in peripheral  but potentially crucial  ways .",
    "firstly , the choice of the stop mass inputs can affect what regions of the mssm parameter space are excluded via higgstrahlung or the aforementioned @xmath65 processes .",
    "the former would suggest choosing high stop inputs to help push @xmath72 up above the lep2 bounds , while the latter might prefer low stop inputs to cancel corrections due to a light chargino .",
    "be such arguments as they may , there is considerable uncertainty in the resulting limits on the general mssm parameter space , and these issues will not be addressed further .",
    "the second consideration is the size of squark and gluino backgrounds to our signature .",
    "discussion of this will be postponed until the end of this section .    to specify the ino sector ,",
    "the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 , in addition to @xmath1 , are required .",
    "@xmath76 is assumed to be determined from @xmath74 via gaugino unification ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath77 ) .",
    "this will determine the tree - level masses ( to which the radiative corrections are quite modest ) of the inos along with their couplings to the higgs bosons .",
    "however , this is not enough , for the inos ( except for @xmath21 ) must also decay ",
    "preferably into leptons for easy detection . to calculate the leptonic ino brs",
    ", one must designate the properties of the slepton sector , since light sleptons can greatly enhance said brs @xcite .",
    "inputs ( assumed to be flavour - diagonal ) from the slepton sector are the left and right soft slepton masses for each of the three generations ( selectrons , smuons , and staus ) and the trilinear ` @xmath59-terms ' which come attached to yukawa factors and thus only @xmath78 has a potential impact . _ a priori _ , all six left and right mass inputs ( and @xmath78 )",
    "are independent .",
    "however , in most models currently advocated , one has @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we will assume such equalities to hold .",
    "to maximise leptonic ino br enhancement , sleptons should be made as light as possible . but",
    "direct searches at lep2 @xcite place significant limits on slepton masses : @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ( these assume that the slepton is not nearly - degenerate with the lsp ) and @xmath84 ( from studies at the @xmath85 pole ) .",
    "furthermore , the sneutrino masses are closely tied to the left soft mass inputs , and , to avoid extra controversial assumptions , we will restrict ourselves to regions of the mssm parameter space where the lsp is the lightest neutralino rather than a sneutrino . to optimise the ino leptonic brs without running afoul of the lep2 limits ,",
    "it is best to set @xmath86 .",
    "if all three generations have the same soft inputs ( with @xmath87 ) , then the slepton sector is effectively reduced to one optimal input value ( which we identify with @xmath88 ) .",
    "however , since ino decays to tau - leptons are generally not anywhere near as beneficial as are ino decays to electrons or muons , it would be even better if the stau inputs were significantly above those of the first two generations .",
    "this would enhance the inos brs into electrons and muons . in the general mssm",
    ", we are of course free to choose the inputs as such .",
    "doing so would also weaken restrictions from lep2 , especially for high @xmath1 values . if we set the soft stau mass inputs @xmath89 above those of the other sleptons ( with @xmath90 still kept at zero ) , the lowest allowable slepton masses , presented in the @xmath91 _ vs. _",

    "[ fig : hto3ell - m2mu1 ] & [ fig : hto3ell - m2mu2 ] that low values for @xmath102 are strongly favoured .",

    "@xmath110 & @xmath111 ( @xmath112 & @xmath113 ) give the gaugino ( higgsino ) component of chargino @xmath114 while @xmath115 & @xmath116 ( @xmath117 & @xmath118 ) give the gaugino ( higgsino ) components of neutralino @xmath119 .",
    "we immediately see from @xmath120 and @xmath121 that if the chargino and the neutralino are both pure gauginos ( the susy counterparts of charged higgs bosons decay into two gauge bosons  for which there is no coupling at tree level ) or both pure higgsinos , then the tree - level decay width is zero . simple phase space considerations favouring decays to lighter inos then disfavour situations in which @xmath122 ( or @xmath123 ) in which case light charginos _ and _ light neutralinos are almost pure gauginos ( higgsinos )  @xmath124 is preferred , ideally with both values as small as possible to make the lighter inos as light as possible ( to the extent that lep2 constraints permit ) .",
    "thus the optimal region for high @xmath37 inos brs is where inos are mixtures of gauginos and higgsinos just above the bends of the lep2 parameter space bounds ( shaded regions in figs .",
    "13 ) in the @xmath91 _ vs. _",
    "@xmath75 plane , @xmath125 is small compared to @xmath126 .",
    "so the @xmath2 to @xmath108-wino higgsino decay susy - related to @xmath127 ( where @xmath12 is now mostly from the down - coupling higgs doublet and so the corresponding higgsino has a dominating @xmath118 component entering into @xmath120 ) is also small .",
    "but the actual inos may not have such compositions . furthermore",
    ", the signature of @xmath37 inos is more distinctive than that of @xmath128  even if the brs for the two processes were similar , more events from the former than from the latter would remain after sufficient cuts were made to eliminate backgrounds . ] .",
    "in addition , one would like to optimise @xmath103 decays where @xmath129 to obtain the vast majority of the decays generating three leptons .",
    "since @xmath130 , @xmath131 generates an lsp that is mostly a @xmath132 bino and a somewhat gaugino - dominated chargino  which is bad for br@xmath133 )  but also makes for a quite light lsp , which over - compensates for the sub - optimal coupling . to increase the other @xmath37 light inos brs ,",
    "the mass of the lsp may be raised by making @xmath91 somewhat larger than @xmath134 .",
    "thus the final perscription for optimal rates is for small @xmath134 values and slightly larger , but still small to moderate values for @xmath91 .",
    "the charged higgs boson brs must now be tied to the production rate to obtain an expected number of signal events .",
    "lowest order ( lo ) results from the parton - level process @xmath135 are strongly dependent on which @xmath136-quark parton distribution function ( pdf ) is chosen for convolution and on the scale at which @xmath137 is evaluated .",
    "moreover , the @xmath136-quark in the initial state originates with a gluon splitting into a @xmath138 pair inside the proton , so that the above @xmath139 process ( when convoluted with initial state radiation involving @xmath140 in the backward evolution ) can alternatively be taken as the @xmath141 hard scattering subprocess @xmath142 interfaced to gluon pdfs .",
    "the two descriptions have complementary strengths : the former most aptly describes ` inclusive ' @xmath143 final states , as it re - sums to all orders large terms of the form @xmath144 ( typically @xmath145 , the choice we adopt here ) , which are absorbed in the phenomenological pdf of the initial @xmath136-quark , while the latter modelling is better at describing ` exclusive ' observables , as it accounts for the correct kinematic behaviour at large transverse momentum of the additional ( or spectator ) @xmath136-quark in the final state . yet contributions from the two processes can not simply be summed .",
    "in fact , the first term of the @xmath136-quark pdf is given by the perturbative solution to the dglap equation -0.2 cm @xmath146 0.1 cm where @xmath147 is the gluon - to-@xmath136 splitting function , and the resulting contribution to @xmath148 is already accounted for by @xmath142 in the collinear limit .",
    "thus , when combining the @xmath139 and @xmath141 processes , the above contribution should be subtracted from the former to avoid double counting @xcite . an alternative approach @xcite involves specifying a threshold in the transverse momentum of the spectator @xmath136-quark , @xmath149 , and then utilising @xmath139 kinematics when @xmath150 and @xmath141 kinematics for @xmath151",
    "this is particularly well - suited to monte carlo ( mc ) event simulations since it does not involve making the aforementioned subtraction with its associated negative weights .",
    "both techniques yield cross section values midway between the larger predictions from @xmath135 and the smaller ones from @xmath142 ( the latter being as much as a factor of 34 below the former ) .    both approaches are less sensitive to the choice of the @xmath136-quark pdf and the mass factorisation scale , @xmath152 , than if the two processes were considered separately .",
    "however , in each case , only some parts of the nlo corrections are accounted for , finally yielding a negative nlo contribution .",
    "quite importantly , recent results @xcite have proved that full nlo corrections to the @xmath139 process ( _ i.e. _ , including both one - loop and radiative qcd corrections ) can yield an overall @xmath153-factor much larger than one - factor is sensitive to the choice of the mass factorisation scale , @xmath152 , and the coupling renormalisation scale .",
    "equating these two scales for convenience , @xmath153-factors near unity are found for low scale choices , @xmath154 , while higher scale choices can yield values on the order of @xmath155-@xmath156 .",
    "see @xcite for further details .",
    "in all cases a @xmath153-factor much less than one is not found . ] , overturning the negative corrections obtained via the above procedures .",
    "thus it is no longer justifiable to adopt normalisations based on these techniques .",
    "the mssm implementation @xcite of the herwig @xcite event generator was used to simulate the @xmath157 process and the various backgrounds .",
    "as most backgrounds are only known to lo accuracy , no additional @xmath153-factors were incorporated and default lo pdfs and @xmath137 values were employed .",
    "this partly explains the improvement to be seen herein relative to ref .",
    "@xcite , where normalisation was via the old subtraction procedure . nonetheless , we still regard our results as conservative since the dominant backgrounds ( after cuts ) are @xmath158 production , which has a similar qcd @xmath153-factor to that of the signal , and irreducible contributions from direct neutralino - chargino pair production , which , being ew processes at tree level , have smaller qcd corrections ( of the order of 20% or so @xcite ) .",
    "yet one should also verify that the additional @xmath136-quark at high transverse momentum produced by the @xmath159 contribution , which is not present in the ( infrared dominated ) backward evolution of the @xmath139 process initial @xmath136-quark , does not render untrustworthy a kinematical analysis done solely utilising the @xmath139 process .",
    "we have confirmed this by also running herwig with @xmath160 as the hard subprocess , adopting our usual selection cuts , and checking that in fact observable quantities ( distributions and event rates ) are not significantly affected by the presence of a spectator @xmath136-quark in the detector .",
    "all results shown will correspond to the outputs of the @xmath139 process .",

    "the drop is due to the closing of the two - body decay modes @xmath181 and @xmath182 , where @xmath183 and @xmath184 are on - mass - shell .",
    "although the two - body decay modes close at this point , the sleptons still make their presence felt in the associated three - body decay modes via off - shell contributions .",

    "this feature is absent for the dotted curve , with @xmath187 , since two - body ino decay modes to the now too heavy sneutrinos are not open .",
    "yet despite the absence of the spoiler modes , rates remain lower in this case because @xmath188s are also heavy , simultaneously weakening the rate to charged leptons ( when both are accessible and neither is phase - space suppressed , ino decays to either @xmath188s or to @xmath189s may be larger , depending on the composition of the neutralino ) .",
    "note also that the dip at @xmath180 is less pronounced since now only two - body decay modes to @xmath190s are turning off at this point rather than to both left and right charged sleptons as in the solid curve .",

    "some of which involve multiple sparticle to sparticle decay chains , simulation of the signal with a robust event generator is imperative to ascertain the percentage of the events predicted utilising sparticle br assignments that survive the cuts needed to sufficiently identify the signature and eliminate the backgrounds .",
    "returning now to the question of potential backgrounds from coloured - sparticle production processes , gluinos and squarks of the first two generations _ may _ in principle produce multi - lepton events with top quarks ; however , in practice , top quarks are quite often not present in such events .",
    "further , the limit on the squark ( gluino ) masses from tevatron studies is now at least @xmath205 ( @xmath206 ) @xcite , and will rise if tevatron searches continue to be unsuccessful .",
    "in addition , if the gaugino unification assumption also encompasses the gluino , then the gluino mass would be in the range @xmath207@xmath208 for the points being considered , and ( at least in msugra - inspired scenarios ) squarks are expected to have heavier or at least comparable masses @xcite .",
    "thus there is substantial rationale for limiting this analysis to heavy gluino and squarks ( of the first two generations ) masses .",
    "stops are different though .",
    "stringent experimental limits from lep2 on stop masses only set a lower bound of @xmath209 @xcite , and stop pair production will generally lead to events containing top quarks .",
    "possible decay chains that could mimic our signal events include for example @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "sbottom pair production can also yield such a final state , as for example via @xmath212 .",
    "note though that such processes do have an extra @xmath136-jet ( typically with high @xmath213 ) beyond that expected from @xmath214 where @xmath97 may be any number of colourless neutral stable particles .",
    "fortunately , our studies indicate that the extra @xmath136-jet that is present in the @xmath215 charged higgs boson production process tends to be rather soft .",
    "so a cut on extra hard jets in the event does tend to remove the background from stop and sbottom pair production ( as well as that from squark and gluino production in general ) .    in keeping with the optimal strategy outlined above for the slepton sector ,",
    "stops are made heavy to minimise this potential background .",
    "thus we deal only with the mssm backgrounds that must be present : that from direct ino pair production ( since we require @xmath37 inos , the inos must be relatively light ) , and what coloured - sparticle backgrounds still remain when we have heavy gluinos and _ all _ squark inputs pushed up to @xmath216 .",
    "a more in depth study of light stops possibly mimicking our signal will be presented in an upcoming analysis @xcite .",
    "before initiating the experimental analysis , we would like to document the potential for utilising the ` @xmath217 ' signature from @xmath37 inos in the more restrictive msugra parameter space .",
    "as we will soon see , here prospects are quite bleak . in msugra ,",
    "the free parameters are generally set as @xmath1 , a universal gaugino mass defined at the grand unification theory ( gut ) scale ( @xmath218 ) , a universal gut - level scalar mass ( @xmath219 ) , a universal gut - level trilinear scalar mass term ( @xmath220 ) , and the sign of @xmath75 . as already noted , the signal has a strong preference for low values of @xmath4 . yet in the msugra scenario , @xmath4 is not a free parameter  it is closely tied to the masses of the scalar higgs bosons via the @xmath219 input .",
    "furthermore , the different soft slepton mass inputs can no longer be set independently : in particular , when evolved down to the ew scale using renormalisation group equations , the staus soft inputs tend to be lower than those of sleptons from the first two generations rather than higher as was put in by hand in the more favourable mssm parameter set choices of the preceding section .",

    "even larger rates for yet higher values of @xmath1 ( @xmath231 ) are swallowed up by the greatly - expanded lep2-excluded region ( sparticles or higgs bosons become unacceptably light and/or the lighter stau becomes the lsp ) .",
    "inputs must be chosen to make soft stau masses high ( while one would like to  but in msugra can not  keep the other soft slepton inputs low to obtain good leptonic decay rates ) to avoid a stau lsp and the lep2 bound on the physical stau mass .",
    "thus the window of allowed points for such extremely high values of @xmath1 is orthogonal to where substantial signal rates are possible .",
    "even with @xmath232 of integrated luminosity , the handful of signal events expected in the best allowed cases would probably be unresolvable from amongst the backgrounds .",

    ", it is very effective against , for instance , the @xmath248 background , when one or more of the leptons originates from a @xmath136-jet .",
    "apart from requiring the three leptons , it is also necessary to reconstruct the ( hadronically decaying ) top quark that is produced in association with the @xmath2 boson .",
    "this is mainly motivated by the need to strongly suppress the @xmath248 and ino - ino backgrounds .",
    "a reconstructed top ( antitop ) quark is recognised via the following cuts :    * -0.1 cm events must have at least three jets , each with @xmath309 in @xmath310 .",

    "-0.1 cm a strong rejection of @xmath248 events is obtained after the requirement of a hadronically reconstructed top quark in addition to the three leptons .",
    "assuming that the three jets reconstructing @xmath169 are indeed correctly assigned , this requirement means that the second top should provide two leptons ( one from the @xmath318 and one from the @xmath136 ) while the third lepton should come from initial / final state radiation ( @xmath319 ) . in this case , two leptons will be in general soft ( @xmath320 ) and non - isolated .",

    "however , the overall @xmath100 br drops precipitously in this region as @xmath16 decreases , and so there is no potential for discovery . ] . there are two reasons for this change : firstly , with set b , @xmath39 has a more favourable gaugino / higgsino mixing than does @xmath38 ; and secondly , for set b brs for @xmath38 decays into sneutrino spoiler modes for @xmath280 are about @xmath379%,@xmath380%,@xmath381%,@xmath382% , whereas for set a these values are all roughly @xmath383% .",
    "@xmath376 decays remain the dominant source of @xmath100 events even for high charged higgs boson masses .",
    "the @xmath384 and @xmath385 decay modes , which led to the majority of the three lepton events for a @xmath386 charged higgs boson with set a , in set b are no longer dominant for higher @xmath44 values , at most providing @xmath387% of the events ( before cuts ) for @xmath388 ( for which mass value the production rate is already too low for any hope of discovery ) .",
    "the @xmath39 decays predominantly into a charged slepton ; the br for @xmath39 decays into staus grows from @xmath389% to @xmath390% as @xmath1 goes from @xmath274 to @xmath273 , cutting into the desired decays to selectrons and smuons .",
    "though @xmath39 decay modes to sneutrinos are accessible too , the combined br for such spoiler modes remain at the @xmath17-@xmath48% level .",
    "the @xmath261 decays through a sneutrino intermediate state and the associated charged lepton become significant for higher values of @xmath1 : this br is @xmath391% ( @xmath392% ) for @xmath393 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "not so useful decays to @xmath394 have brs of @xmath395-@xmath396% . ] .",

    ", there is enough kinematical phase space for most of the resulting leptons to have sufficiently high transverse momenta to pass the signal selection criteria .",
    "in parameter set c the neutralinos @xmath268 , @xmath254 , @xmath255 and @xmath256 have masses of @xmath401 , @xmath402 , @xmath403 and @xmath404 , respectively .",
    "the masses of the charginos @xmath261 and @xmath262 are @xmath405 and @xmath404 .",
    "scanning over @xmath16 and @xmath1 , after the customary selection cuts , now leads to the @xmath356-discovery potential seen in the bottom plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] .",
    "the reach both in @xmath16 and @xmath1 is strongly reduced in comparison to the previous scenarios , in part due to the heavier ino mass spectrum which gives the expected upwards shift of the left edge in @xmath16 . as with set b , @xmath376 is the dominant source of signal events for @xmath406 ( @xmath407 ) and @xmath408 ( @xmath273 ) . for @xmath409 ,",
    "virtually all ( @xmath410% ) signal events come via this channel . for higher masses , @xmath411 and @xmath412 contributions grow to become comparable .",
    "also , as with set b , the @xmath39 decays predominantly into a charged slepton ; again decays into staus  br @xmath413% ( @xmath414% ) for @xmath415 ( @xmath273 )  cut into the desired decays to selectrons and smuons .",
    "the sneutrino spoiler modes also have a combined br roughly in the @xmath18-@xmath27% range .",
    "the @xmath261 decays through a sneutrino intermediate state : for @xmath416 , about @xmath417 of the time into sneutrinos of the first two generations and about @xmath282 of the time into a @xmath283 and the associated @xmath418-lepton . for higher values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the @xmath419 decay mode becomes accesssible and reaches a br of almost @xmath420% by the time @xmath1 reaches @xmath273 .",
    "now crucial mass differences have values of ( @xmath397 , @xmath293 , @xmath294 ) = ( @xmath421-@xmath422 , @xmath423-@xmath424 , @xmath387-@xmath299 ) .",
    "most significantly , there is considerably less phase space available to leptons produced in chargino to sneutrino decays for set c and the values for sets a & b is more striking when @xmath1 is restricted to be @xmath425 .",
    "then for a and b @xmath426-@xmath297 while for c the value is @xmath423-@xmath322 , with this mass difference growing with increasing @xmath1 for a and b and shrinking with increasing @xmath1 for c. ] ; thus , said leptons are typically too soft and usually fail the @xmath213 cut .",
    "this explains the much smaller discovery reach for set c compared to the one for set b.    for @xmath224 , the same magnitude of @xmath134 leads to heavier inos ( in particular , the lsp and lighter chargino ) .",
    "thus , for a fixed @xmath134 , we expect a smaller signal rate for @xmath224 than for @xmath223 .",
    "however , the more rapid rise of the chargino mass as @xmath134 increases with @xmath224 also means that we can go to smaller @xmath134 values on this side before we run afoul of the lep2 excluded region in the formula for the chargino mass , and hence the asymmetry diminishes as the @xmath1 value increases . ] .",
    "thus , one can shift to lower @xmath134 values on the @xmath224 side to obtain roughly the same rates as found on the @xmath223 side ( _ cf .",
    "_ , fig .  4 of @xcite ) .    some perspective as to the new regions of mssm parameter space that might be probed via the ` @xmath247 ' channel is provided by fig .  [ fig : contour4 ] , which shows the reach of this @xmath37 inos signature in the case , @xmath75 and @xmath88 , not in general . ] of parameter set a together with those of the @xmath427 and @xmath28 channels , with @xmath1 plotted on a logarithmic scale to better illustrate the intermediate @xmath1 regime .",
    "the discovery reaches for channels where the @xmath2 decays to sm particles also assume set a mssm input parameters and lo normalisation for the production process ; however , said contours do not take into account possible susy backgrounds .",
    "the contour for @xmath28 also only takes into account the 3@xmath136-final state analysis @xcite .",
    "more detailed studies , including 4@xmath136-final states , are ongoing .",
    "however , we do not expect major changes in the ( @xmath428 ) reach for this channel .",
    "similar plots combining the sm and mssm channels can be drawn for the other two mssm parameter sets .",
    "comparison of the `` @xmath429 '' and `` @xmath430 '' contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour4 ] with the analogous discovery regions in @xcite , which used @xmath431 and @xmath432 as inputs , show the former contours to have shrunk somewhat relative to the latter ones , as expected since the combined br@xmath433 is larger in relevant parts of the @xmath434 plane for set a inputs than for the inputs of @xcite .",
    "this shows that the ino decays will reduce the rates for the conventional @xmath2 signatures .",
    "in particular , relative to a case where the ino decay modes are closed ( such as when @xmath134 , @xmath91 , and sfermion masses are all large ) the sm - like discovery regions may be significantly reduced .",
    "this makes the search for the ` @xmath247 ' signature from @xmath435 decays all the more important .    -0.4",
    "cm    -0.5 cm",
    "in summary , we have proven that susy decays of charged higgs bosons can profitably be exploited at the lhc in order to detect these important particles .",
    "we have done an extensive probe of the mssm parameter space to see where decays of the type @xmath436 , ( @xmath363 , @xmath266 ) can yield hadronically quiet three lepton ( electrons and/or muons ) final states . here",
    "all tree - level decay chains allowable within the mssm have been taken into account .",
    "coupling such decay chains with top - associated charged higgs boson production , we selected a signature consisting of three hard isolated leptons ( electrons and/or muons ) , three hard jets which reconstruct the top quark ( with one pair thereof also reconstructing a @xmath318 boson and the other bearing a @xmath136-tag ) and substantial missing transverse energy .",
    "we then performed quite realistic mc studies utilising the herwig event generator and modelling the cms detector .",
    "the hard subprocess used for the signal was @xmath157 ( and c.c . ) , supplemented by initial and final state parton shower and hadronisation , with overall lo normalisation .",
    "( all backgrounds were generated at the same level of accuracy . )",
    "recent studies @xcite have found that , in contrast to the negative corrections to said lo production subprocess utilised in the past , nlo corrections are in fact positive and may be substantial  depending upon the choice of input scales ( see @xcite ) @xmath153-factor enhancements of @xmath437 may be obtained , comparable to or even larger than the corresponding corrections for the leading backgrounds .",
    "inclusion of such nlo effects in future signal and background analyses may well expand the discovery reach of this channel .",
    "we found that this ` @xmath247 ' signature has the potential to provide coverage over an area of the mssm parameter space roughly corresponding to @xmath358 @xmath438 and @xmath439 .",
    "this region covers a substantial portion of parameter space where @xmath440 decays into ordinary particles have been shown to be ineffective .",
    "however , to this must be added the _ caveat _ that other mssm input parameters must be favourable . to wit ,",
    "a small value for @xmath4 and a small to moderate @xmath91 value are essential for having substantial @xmath441 brs ( with @xmath442 to put more weight on ino decays not including the lsp ) and light sleptons are crucial for enhancing the leptonic brs of the inos .",
    "said slepton intermediates may be on- or off- mass shell ; though of course it is optimal if the two - body on - shell ino decay mode into a slepton and a lepton is open , as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : hto3ell - mslep ] .",
    "naturally , the actual physical masses of the sleptons ( selectrons , smuons and the associated sneutrinos ) should be less than those of an ino pair into which the charged higgs boson has a significant br .",
    "depending on the ino masses as fixed by the mssm parameter inputs , this dictates slepton masses of @xmath443 or lower in the discovery regions documented in this work .",
    "regions in mssm parameter space satisfying such criteria tend to be sufficiently close to the lep2 limits and/or to those derived after run 2 at the tevatron that such regions should be readily accessible to probing by the lhc .",
    "we have made very few assumptions about the underlying susy - breaking dynamics associated with some much higher energy scale , and hence defined all relevant mssm input parameters at the ew scale .",
    "( the msugra model was analysed as a possible gut benchmark but failed to shown any potential for the considered decay channel . )",
    "the discovery reach shown in fig . 9 ( for a reasonably favourable choice of these parameters )",
    "illustrates the possible power of this new channel .",
