    "cosmic string loops have raised a lot of interest in the past decades .",
    "they are believed to form in the evolution of cosmic string networks .",
    "while standard loops of cosmic string eventually decay , it has been suggested that fermionic or bosonic currents `` living '' on the loop of string can stabilize it against decay .",
    "this was first put forward in @xcite within a model of superconducting strings @xcite .",
    "such stable cosmic string loops are called _ vortons _ ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the case of bosonic currents , a scalar field condensate builds up in the core of the string and leads to a conserved ( noether ) current .",
    "vortons have been constructed explicitly in a scalar field model with @xmath2 symmetry @xcite .",
    "fermionic currents appear due to the coupling of the string forming higgs and/or gauge field to fermions .",
    "the aim of this paper is the construction of the spectrum of both massless and massive fermionic bound states on cosmic string loops . for an infinitely long straight string",
    "the spectrum is well known : the number of zero modes is given by an index theorem and equals the winding number of the string  @xcite , and there are massive bound states as well  @xcite . the equivalent question for the string loop",
    "is hardly studied .",
    "an incomplete analysis of this case was done in @xcite ; they found that the number of zero modes is equal to the local winding number of the string .",
    "although this seems to agree with the result as for the infinitely long straight string , we note that the straight string has a net winding whereas the loop does not . in @xcite the existence of fermionic zero modes for a curved string",
    "was established analyzing small curvature corrections to the straight string solution .",
    "however , it is not clear whether this analysis can be extended to string loops . in this paper",
    ", we asymptotically solve the fermionic equations of motion in the presence of a string loop .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we will show that no fermionic zero modes or massive bounds states exists on cosmic string loops .",
    "and thus no fermionic vortons exists .",
    "in fact , we would not expect the existence of fermionic zero modes on string loops .",
    "the number of zero modes is an adiabatic invariant .",
    "one can adiabatically change the string loop to the trivial vacuum background , and the latter supports no bound states . saying it in other words , the topological charge of the whole system is zero , and it follows from an index theorem @xcite that there are no bound states .",
    "this statement can be verified explicitly in the much simpler case of a kink - antikink system .",
    "this system carries no net topological charge , it can be adiabatically deformed to the trivial vacuum . and",
    "indeed , solving the equations of motion , we find that the kink - antikink does not support fermionic bound states .",
    "the kink - antikink system is quite analogue to the set - up with two parallel straight strings with opposite winding number . for these simpler systems",
    ", we find that there are no fermionic zero modes for systems with vanishing net topological charge .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the spectrum of fermion bound states on kinks and antikinks . in section 3 we move on to cosmic strings , and discuss single straight strings , two parallel strings as well as string loops .",
    "we end with conclusions in section 4 .",
    "we first examine the relatively simple system of kinks and antikinks .",
    "we expect that many of the results , which as we will see are topological in nature , carry over to the case of cosmic strings to be discussed in the next section .      consider a bosonic background of the form = . [ phidw ] with @xmath3 .",
