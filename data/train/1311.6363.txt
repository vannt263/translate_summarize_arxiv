    "the fmo monomer contains eight bacteriochlorophyll _ a _ ( bchl_a _ ) molecular sites @xcite ,",
    "of which the recently discovered eighth pigment @xcite is only weakly coupled to the other bchls and thus will be omitted in the present investigation .",
    "the hamiltonian restricted to the single excitation subspace for the remaining seven sites is @xmath5 , where the basis states @xmath6 indicate that the @xmath7-th site is in its excited state and all other sites are in their ground states .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the energy of the @xmath7-th site and @xmath9 denotes the electronic coupling between sites @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "we use the numerically determined site energies and dipolar couplings calculated by adolphs and renger @xcite ( the explicit form is given in the supporting information ) . here",
    ", the bchl 3 is the site with the lowest energy which is connected to the rc and forms the exit site @xcite out of the fmo complex .",
    "bchls 1 and 6 are oriented towards the baseplate protein as indicated by experimental results @xcite .",
    "these sites are therefore considered as the entrance sites which are the initially excited sites .",
    "the surrounding vibrational pigment - protein - solvent environment induces thermal fluctuations on the excitation transfer dynamics .",
    "we treat the electronic states of the fmo complex within an open quantum system approach @xcite .",
    "the thermal fluctuations are generated by environmental harmonic modes @xcite .",
    "thus the total hamiltonian is @xmath11 with momenta @xmath12 , displacements @xmath13 , frequencies @xmath14 and coupling constants @xmath15 of the environmental vibrations at site @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the fluctuations at different bchl sites are identical in their characteristics , but spatially uncorrelated @xcite . within this open quantum system approach , the environmental fluctuations and their coupling to the system dynamics are characterized by their spectral density @xmath16 .",
    "this distribution function determines the temporal correlations of the environmental fluctuating forces @xcite . here",
    ", we use experimentally determined @xcite and theoretically parametrized @xcite form @xmath17 .",
    "this fluctuational spectrum contains both a broad low frequency contribution @xmath18 by the protein vibrations with huang - rhys factor @xmath19 and a single effective vibrational mode of the pigments centered at @xmath20 @xmath0 with huang - rhys factor @xmath21 @xcite ( the detailed form is given in the si ) .",
    "below , we will also study the case of a stronger excitonic - vibrational mode coupling , since adolphs and renger have determined a larger huang - rhys factor of @xmath22 @xcite . in general , within the system - bath approach , the environment is commonly assumed to be in a thermal equilibrium state .",
    "thus , including a discrete vibrational mode into the environmental spectrum implicitly assumes that the time scale of thermalization of this mode is much shorter than any system time scale .",
    "then , the discrete mode only provides thermal equilibrium fluctuations around its thermal state .",
    "however , recent analyses @xcite propose that underdamped vibrational modes are present , which are strongly coupled to the electronic transitions with large huang - rhys factors , and which are close to resonance to excitonic transitions . the observed long - lasting coherent signals @xcite are then attributed to the coupled exciton - underdamped mode system . in this scenario ,",
    "the full nonadiabatic quantum dynamics of the vibrational mode has to be considered and not only its thermal equilibrium fluctuations .",
    "we therefore include in the following the vibrational mode at @xmath4 @xmath0 explicitly as part of the _ system _ hamiltonian and thus describe its nonequilibrium quantum dynamics on an equal footing as the excitonic states . due to the exponential growth of needed computer power for quapi with increasing system size ( see si ) , we restrict the localized mode to its three ( two ) lowest energy eigenstates for site 3 ( all others ) . in detail , we include all states up to the energy of the site with lowest energy , i.e. site 3 , plus two times thermal energy .      in order to discuss the efficiency of the energy transfer through the fmo complex towards the rc , we model the latter as an energy sink which is connected solely to site @xmath23 .",
    "we treat the transfer towards the rc as a population decay on a purely phenomenological level by constant decay rate of @xmath24 ps@xmath25 since we are not interested in the explicit details of the dumping process .",
    "backtransfer from the rc to the fmo complex is then excluded here . in turn",
    ", the rise time of the population growth of the rc is taken as a measure for the efficiency of the energy transfer through the complex .    to evaluate the influence of localized vibrational modes on the exciton transfer dynamics",
    ", we first provide the excitonic dynamics in absence of any vibrational mode as a reference .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the results for the individual site populations along with the population @xmath26 of the energy sink .",

    "[ fig:1 ] as a reference , we next consider the exciton dynamics when every individual fmo site is coupled to its own vibrational mode .",
    "all of them are assumed to have equal characteristics and we choose in this section a huang - rhys factor of @xmath21 .",
    "the quapi method is limited by the exponential growth of the array sizes and the computational times for growing system hilbert space dimensions ( see si ) .",
    "we thus have to limit the hilbert space dimensions to vibrational states with energies up to @xmath31 @xmath0 above the energy of site @xmath23 .",
    "the exciton eigenstates of the fmo complex , obtained by diagonalizing the fmo system hamiltonian , show that the included vibrational states have comparable or larger energies .",
    "the relevant vibrational modes which influence the system dynamics are those with energies comparable to the energy difference between the exciton states @xcite .",
    "thus , the relevant fmo excitonic energy ranges are sufficiently covered , and therefore , the technical restriction of truncated vibrational energies has no severe implications .",
    "the results for initially excited entrance sites without vibrational excitation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . we observe both prolonged oscillatory population dynamics with increased coherence times _ and _ an increased transfer efficiency , as indicated by the faster rise of the population @xmath26 of the energy sink .",
    "but in presence of individual vibrational modes at each individual molecular site .",
    "vibrational states with energies up to @xmath31 @xmath0 above the energy of site @xmath23 are included and all vibrational modes have equal characteristics.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the increased transfer efficiency can be quantified in terms of the time which is required for the transfer of excitation energy through the fmo complex . a measure for this is the rise time of the exponential growth of the population @xmath26 of the rc to which we refer as transfer time in short .",
    "the dynamical simulations allow us to read off the rise times , the results are summarized in table  [ tab : table ] .",
    "we find that , when vibrational modes are coupled to all individual sites separately and including all states with energies up to @xmath31 @xmath0 above the energy of site @xmath23 , the transfer times decreases by about @xmath32 .",
    "the speed - up is slightly larger when the initial excitation starts at site @xmath24 due to the shorter route @xcite .",
    "in the site representation , this proceeds along the chain @xmath33 . in turn ,",
    "when the excitation starts at site @xmath34 , it follows @xmath35 .",
    "a speed - up of about @xmath32 is significant .",
    ".excitation energy transfer times at @xmath29 k without and with nonequilibrium vibrational modes coupled to the excitonic transitions .",
    "a negative change in the transfer time indicates a speed - up , while a positive sign indicates a slower transfer as compared to the case without vibrational states . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to further elucidate by which more detailed mechanism the vibrations enhance the coherence times and the transfer efficiency , we study next the excitonic dynamics by including a single localized vibrational mode only at selected sites separately .",
    "in particular , we consider the two cases , ( i ) when the vibrational mode is coupled to the entrance site @xmath24 , and ( ii ) when it is coupled to the exit site @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding results are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] , respectively .",

    "[ fig:3 ] for both values of the temperature , an enlarged time window exists with an oscillatory dynamics of the populations , after which they continue by an incoherent decay .",
    "this effect is more pronounced when the site @xmath24 is initially excited ( upper row ) as compared to an initial preparation in site @xmath34 ( lower row ) .",
    "in particular , the energy coherently oscillates between the sites @xmath24 and @xmath36 over several hundreds of femtoseconds .",
    "a closer inspection of the dynamics shows that the oscillations in the exciton populations indeed go back to coherent transitions between the vibrational ground state and the vibrational first excited state at site @xmath24 .",
    "we extract coherence times of about @xmath37 fs for @xmath38 k and of @xmath3 fs for @xmath39 k , which coincide which those reported in the experiments @xcite .",
    "however , we observe that the associated energy transfer times have _ increased _ in comparison with the case when vibrational modes are excluded ( see table  [ tab : table ] ) .",
    "these results prove that the coupling of a nonequilibrium vibrational mode to the entrance site @xmath24 enhances coherence times , but decreases the overall transfer efficiency .",
    "the corresponding findings also arise when a single vibrational mode is coupled to the entrance site @xmath34 ( see table  [ tab : table ] and si ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "when the vibrational mode is coupled to the _ exit _ site @xmath23 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , the coherence times are not enhanced as compared to the case without any vibrational mode ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "this is not surprising since site @xmath23 is only rather weakly coupled to its neighbours and additionally coupled to the rc acting as an incoherent energy sink .",
    "however , it is important to realize that the population of the sink grows faster in this constellation and , consequently , the transfer efficiency is increased , as seen in table  [ tab : table ] .",
    "this speed - up of the transfer efficiency is a key observation and can be directly rationalized in terms of an additional transfer channel which is provided by the excited vibrational state at site @xmath23 .",
    "this excited vibrational state is nearly in resonance with the electronic transition and thus decreases the energy gap with the entrance sites . by this",
    ", it adds an additional efficient pathway in form of a vibrational decay channel into the rc .",
    "accordingly , more states connected to the rc are available to become populated during the exciton transfer in the complex and , consequently , more states can dump their energy into the sink in parallel .",
    "the population of the sink then can grow faster and yields to an overall increased transfer efficiency .    overall , the underdamped modes at @xmath4 @xmath0 improve the efficiency of the quantum coherent excitation energy transfer and at the same time result in the observed prolongued quantum coherent oscillations .",
    "both are a result of the modes being underdamped , such that they can not thermalize on time scales fast compared to the electronic energy transfer dynamics .",
    "beyond that , the speed - up of the energy transfer is rather insensitive to the actual coherence life times .",
    "having studied the effect of nonequilibrium vibrational states on the exciton transfer efficiency , we study next the impact of a larger coupling of the vibrational mode and the electronic transitions , i.e. , for a larger huang - rhys factor .",
    "so far , we have considered an intermediate exciton - vibrational coupling .",
    "based on the data of the temperature dependence of the fluorescence line - narrowing spectra , wendling et al .",
    "@xcite have determined a huang - rhys factor @xmath40 .",
    "this corresponds to a coupling strength of @xmath41 @xmath0 ( see the si for details ) . on the other hand ,",
    "adolphs and renger @xcite have found a huang - rhys factor of @xmath42 for the vibrational mode at @xmath4 @xmath0 , which is about one order of magnitude larger .",
    "this corresponds to a vibrational coupling strength of @xmath43 @xmath0 .",
    "these two values correspond to the regime of the intermediate and the strong exciton - vibrational mode coupling , respectively .",
    "we show next that for the strong coupling regime , the same physical picture applies as in the intermediate regime considered so far , but small quantitative differences arise ( see table s1 in the si ) .    here",
    ", we focus on the study of the transient coherent oscillations and do not include the additional sink at the exit site @xmath23 .",
    "the results in figs.[fig:5 ] and [ fig:6 ] show the cases when the vibrational mode is coupled to the entrance site @xmath24 and to the exit site @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the case when the vibrational mode is coupled to the second entrance site @xmath34 is discussed in the si . a single initial condition @xmath27",
    "is chosen for both cases at physiological ( @xmath29k ) and cryogenic ( @xmath30k ) temperatures .     in absence of the reaction center .",

    "[ fig:5 ] ( lower row ) on the one hand strong beatings in the populations between the vibrational ground state and the vibrational first excited state at site @xmath24 . on the other hand",
    ", however , we also find coherent beatings between exciton sites @xmath24 and @xmath36 without excitation of the vibrational state . at room temperature ,",
    "coherent oscillations survive for up to about @xmath44 fs and at @xmath2 k for at least up to @xmath45 fs .",
    "these coherence times are comparable to those of the experiments @xcite . for an intermediate value of the exciton - vibrational coupling , we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ( upper row ) longer intersite coherence times of around @xmath37 fs . in this case , the excitonic coupling between sites @xmath24 and @xmath36 is relatively larger than the vibrational coupling of the vibrational ground and first excited states at site @xmath24 . on the other hand , in the strong coupling regime longer intrasite coherence times are obtained because the coupling of the vibrational ground at site @xmath24 is of the same order of magnitude as the coupling to the site @xmath36 or to its vibrational excited state .",
    "this competition is reflected by the faster rise of the population of the vibrational first excited state at site @xmath24 .",
    "when coupling the vibrational mode to the exit site @xmath23 but initially exciting site @xmath24 , we see in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] that the coherence times are comparable with those observed without explicitly taking an underdamped @xmath4 @xmath0 mode into account , see ref .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the two sites @xmath24 and @xmath23 are only very weakly coupled . at room temperature , coherence survives for up to about @xmath46 fs and at @xmath2 k for up to @xmath47 fs at most in both regimes of the coupling .",
    "nevertheless , we observe a fast increase in the population of the vibrational first excited site @xmath23 @xmath48 which is even faster than the population accumuluation in its vibrational ground state @xmath49 .",
    "this fast population accumuluation is a result of the refined matching of the energies of site @xmath24 and of site @xmath23 when exciting the vibrational state while tunneling .",
    "this is another remarkable finding , since site @xmath23 is believed to be the exit site towards the reaction center and a larger population of site @xmath23 will result in an overall increased transfer efficiency through the fmo complex towards the reaction center , irrespective of the excitation status of the vibration .",
    "thus , underdamped vibrational modes indeed improve the overall energy transfer efficiency .",
    "these results show that an additional underdamped vibrational mode at site @xmath23 increases the transfer efficiency since it provides additional channels for the parallel decay of the energy into the rc .",
    "in contrast , additional underdamped vibrational states at other sites ( see si ) tend to decrease the transfer efficiency since they provide additional states in which the energy is intermittently stored and eventually dissipated via the vibrational channel or fed back into the excitonic network at a later stage .",
    "hence , only an efficiently connected exit site helps to improve the global transfer , while additional states at the intermediate sites only lead to an inefficient spreading - out of the energy into too many channels .",
    "we have obtained numerically exact results for the real - time nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of the excitation energy transfer through the fmo complex in presence of realistic environmental fluctuations and an underdamped localized vibrational mode at @xmath4 @xmath0 .",
    "our analysis shows that the coupling of the excitonic transitions to a nearly resonant vibrational mode causes strong vibrational quantum coherent beatings in the intrasite populations of individual pigments . at the same time",
    ", however , the nearly resonant coupling also causes strong coherent excitonic beatings in the intersite population transfer between different pigments .",
    "however , prolonged coherent intersite beatings do not necessarily lead to an enhanced transfer efficiency .",
    "we show that only the additional vibrational states at the exit site @xmath23 of the fmo complex help to speed - up the global energy transfer by providing additional transfer channels to the exit site towards the reaction center .",
    "in fact , they lead to a speed - up of up to @xmath1 in the transfer times through the complex . long - lasting coherence in the complex results from the coupling of the vibrational modes to particular entrance and exit sites .",
    "it is , however , not functionally necessary for the enormous speed - up of energy transfer which thus is a rather robust mechanism .",
    "+ these results offer a benchmark principle which may be implemented in artificial light - harvesting systems as well .",
    "their global quantum transfer efficiency can be significantly increased by engineering the corresponding almost resonant vibrational modes , thereby maintaining the number of absorbing photoactive sites constant .",
