    "a wide range of fluids can be quenched into a disordered , solid state .",

    "experiments by van megen _",
    "@xcite showed that besides the fluid and the ordered crystalline phase , colloidal suspensions in thermal equilibrium can also form colloidal glasses : a dynamically arrested state of the system which is characterized by diverging relaxation times @xcite .",
    "while a complete theoretical understanding of the glass transition in fragile glass formers is still missing @xcite , mode coupling theories can quite successfully describe some of the phenomena on a quantitative level @xcite .",
    "one interesting question has been raised more recently : does the glass transition survive , if the system is driven by external forcing into a nonequilibrium state ? or more generally , can one observe a glass transition also in a nonequilibrium system ? a well studied example are sheared colloidal suspensions for which it was shown that the equilibrium glass transition disappears @xcite .",
    "another example is nonlinear microrheology @xcite , where a strong pulling force is applied to a single particle , forcing it out of its cage , thereby possibly melting the glass .",
    "another system far from equilibrium are athermal packings of particles @xcite , undergoing a jamming transition at a critical packing fraction .",
    "many of the properties close to the jamming point resemble those of fluids at the glass transitions .",
    "this observation is at the heart of the jamming diagram , where the glass transition in thermal systems and the jamming transition are part of a larger parameter space @xcite .",
    "since granular particles are too large to be thermally activated , one necessarily needs a driving force to keep the grains in motion for extended periods of time . while in nature",
    ", gravity is probably the most important driving force @xcite , experimentalists have devised quite a few methods of fluidisation .",
    "the list includes shaking @xcite , electrostatic @xcite or magnetic @xcite excitation and fluidization by air @xcite or water @xcite .",
    "we have recently investigated the possibility of a glass transition in driven granular fluids . in two publications",
    "@xcite , henceforth referred to as i and ii , we have demonstrated that mode coupling theory ( mct ) can be generalized to the far from equilibrium stationary state of a granular fluid .",
    "in particular we found a granular glass transition for all degrees of dissipation , accompanied by the common signatures of a dense fluid close to the glass transition . here ,",
    "a careful derivation of the granular mode coupling equations is presented and the consequences of mct are worked out in detail .",
    "we furthermore extend our previous analysis to two - dimensional systems , which are realized in many experiments on granular matter @xcite .",

    "the dissipative interactions of the granular particles imply two primary consequences .",
    "first , while the dynamics of particles in thermal equilibrium is microscopically time reversal invariant , the symmetry under time reversal is broken for granular dynamics .",
    "second , there is no natural equilibrium reference state like for the sheared colloids  @xcite , were the fluid can be thought of as being driven out of equilibrium by the optional external driving force . in the granular system",

    "thereby , the external force does not destroy momentum conservation on length scales @xmath26 .",
    "we choose @xmath25 on the order of a mean particle separation .      for undriven granular fluids",
    ", it is known that the homogeneous cooling state is unstable to shear- and eventually to density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "in fact , the particles form extremely dense clusters .",
    "no such clustering instability is predicted @xcite , and indeed observed , for the randomly driven fluid .",
    "consequently , we assume that the fluid is macroscopically homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "this implies that all spatial two - point correlation functions @xmath27 are functions of the distance @xmath28 only . in the stationary state ,",
    "the system is also time translation invariant , implying that time dependent correlation functions are only functions of time differences .",
    "macroscopically , the fluid is fully characterized by the packing fraction , @xmath2 ( where @xmath29 in @xmath4 and @xmath30 in @xmath3 ) , the coefficient of restitution , @xmath0 , and the driving power , @xmath19 .",
    "a more conventional description is given in terms of the packing fraction and the granular temperature @xmath31 .",
    "the latter is given by the balance between the driving power , @xmath19 , and the energy loss through the inelastic collisions , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 in a mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "the collision frequency @xmath34 is the only time scale of the system .",
    "thus , changing the granular temperature only changes the time scale of the system . to keep the discussion more transparent ,",
    "we refrain from using the freedom to set @xmath35 but keep in mind that the qualitative behavior of the system is independent of the temperature @xmath36 .",
    "the two relevant observables discussed in the following are the density field , @xmath37 , and the current density , @xmath38 , with the following microscopic definitions :    @xmath39    we will use the spatial fourier transforms @xmath40(t)$ ] and the longitudinal current @xmath41(t)$ ] .",

    "our approach starts from the microscopic description of the particle dynamics in terms of the location in phase space , @xmath59 and the trajectory of the external driving force @xmath60 .",
    "macroscopic observables @xmath61 are then introduced as expectation values with respect to the phase space distribution function @xmath62 of the microscopic variables . here , we restrict ourselves to the stationary state , where the distribution function is time independent , @xmath63 .",
    "in contrast to fluids in equilibrium , no analytical expression for the stationary phase space distribution of driven granular fluids is known so far .",
    "therefore we have to make a few assumptions to evaluate the expectation values .",
    "first of all we assume that positions and velocities are uncorrelated , @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , we assume that the velocity distribution factorizes into a product of one particle distribution functions , @xmath65 .",

    "the spatial distribution function , @xmath69 , enters the theory via static correlation function , as will be discusssed below .",
    "a common expectation in disordered systems is , that the macroscopic expectation values should be self averaging , i.e. , independent of any specific disorder realization @xcite . in our model",
    ", this applies to the stochastic driving force @xmath70 , i.e. , we define macroscopic observables as averages over all realizations of the driving , @xmath71 .",
    "here , @xmath72 is the distribution of the random forces .",

    ", it can be shown that detailed balance implies @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the liouville operator describing time reversed dynamics .",
    "this relation does not hold for inelastic collisions which are discussed here . in the present context , an explicit expression for @xmath75 is not needed and hence will be given elsewhere .",

    "[ sec : equation - motion ] below ) . finally , it is known @xcite that navier - stokes - order hydrodynamics does not exist in @xmath3 , presumably implying logarithmic corrections to the sound damping in @xmath3 .    in the following , we set @xmath140 . in fig .",
