    "it has often been recognized and stated that boson mapping is not only relevant to discussions about the relationship between phenomenological boson models and shell model type fermion models , but that it also constitutes an attractive many - body formalism in its own right ( see e.g.  refs .",

    "the latter pronouncement is against the background that one might profit from the use of boson variables in the description of many - fermion problems through the potentially simpler algebraic structures associated with bosons .",
    "this philosophy has its roots in the very simple observation that bosons commute to a @xmath2-number , while fermion pairs commute to a non - trivial operator .",
    "correspondingly the construction of an orthonormal basis is in general then simpler for bosons than for fermion pairs . except for a few cases ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "[ 39 ] ) , this has not been exploited much as a possible simpler route to solution of a many - body problem .",
    "in this paper we demonstrate how the known algebraic structure associated with s d and g may indeed be exploited to solve non - trivial fermion models .",
    "we analyze and discuss an extension of the original ginocchio so(8 ) and sp(6 ) models which have also been re - interpreted and used in the fermion dynamical symmetry model ( fdsm )  @xcite .",
    "the extension is based on a closed algebraic structure in terms of fermion pairs which now also includes a g - pair and leads to the so(12 ) and sp(10 ) dynamical symmetries .",
    "such an extension has also recently been presented by p.  feng _ et al . _",

    "before we introduce and analyze these sdg - generalizations of the ginocchio ( fdsm ) models , we discuss in sec.[sec2 ] the basic principle underlying the construction of algebraic fermion models structured around the concept of favored pairs .",
    "we focus namely on the respective roles of physical and algebraic angular momenta  @xcite , thus arriving at a division into active and inert parts of the angular momentum from a point of view we regard as more fundamental than the usual consideration where such a division is simply introduced as a convenience .    in sec .",

    "in algebraic collective models one assumes that collective states ( of a given collective mode ) can be constructed by acting with the generators @xmath4 of a so - called spectrum generating algebra  @xcite @xmath5 on a reference state @xmath6 .",
    "the reference state is a fermion state ( not necessarily the ground state ) and @xmath5 is an algebra of fermion operators .",
    "such models have the advantage of being simple enough to incorporate in them an exact conservation of basic symmetries of fermion systems . the simplest way to do that is to build the generators of @xmath5 as irreducible tensors of conserved symmetries .",
    "in particular , the generators should either conserve or change by a given value the particle number of the system , and similarly , either conserve or carry with them a given angular momentum . in what follows we concentrate our discussion on the conservation of these two symmetries .",
    "the conservation of the particle number means that some subset of generators of @xmath5 should commute with the particle number operator and constitute a spectrum generating algebra for a given fermion system .",
    "some other generators should decrease or increase the fermion number either by one , in which case one unifies the dynamics of even and odd nuclei , or by two if one wants to consider only even systems . in this paper",
    "we consider only spectrum generating algebras built of pair - creation , pair - annihilation and single - particle operators . in principle",
    "one should consider many - body terms in either of these operators which would be a natural extension in the spirit of constructing effective operators resulting from a reduction to a small phase space . in the algebraic approach , however , this is a very difficult task and only a few developments have been made in this direction ( see e.g. ref .",

    "it is a very natural one if one aims at constructing a useful algebraic model .",
    "it means that we want to include in @xmath5 the operator which would measure the physical angular momentum . in this way",
    "the model space , which is generated by acting with generators of @xmath5 on the reference state , will always comprise complete multiplets of the physical angular momentum . by the same requirement we also have to assume that @xmath17 is a single - particle operator , similarly to @xmath12 .",
    "of course , the physical angular momentum @xmath12 itself can belong to the spectrum generating algebra @xmath5 .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) are then just a duplication of the same property .",
    "this is the case , for example , in the cm(3 ) model  @xcite or the symplectic sp(3,r ) model  @xcite where generators are constructed from particle coordinates .",

    "this fact has important consequences for the structure of the underlying fermion space . indeed , having at our disposal two commuting single - particle operators we can attribute _ two _ angular momentum quantum numbers to every single - particle state .",
    "more specifically , let us suppose that algebra @xmath5 is built in the spherical shell model space of single - fermion states described by the creation operators @xmath28 .",
    "these states are grouped in multiplets ( @xmath29-shells ) with respect to the physical angular momentum and therefore @xmath28 are irreducible tensors with respect to @xmath12 , @xmath30 =        -\\sqrt{j(j+1)}(1mjm_j|jm_j+m)a^+_{njm_j+m},\\ ] ] where @xmath31 distinguishes multiplets of the same @xmath29 .",
    "the existence of two commuting angular momenta allows one now to group single - particle states in another set of multiplets ( @xmath32-@xmath33-shells ) each described the by fermion creation operators @xmath34 which are irreducible tensors with respect to @xmath21 and @xmath17 _ simultaneously _ ,    & = & -(1mrm_r|rm_r+m ) a^+_nrm_r+mpm_p , [ e15a ] +    & = & -(1mpm_p|pm_p+m ) a^+_nrm_rpm_p+m .",
    "[ e15b ]    here @xmath35 distinguishes the @xmath32-@xmath33-shells with the same values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "we have therefore shown that assumption ( [ e2 ] ) induces a very specific structure of the fermion space , namely , the grouping of single - particle states into @xmath32-@xmath33-shells .",
    "the values of the quantum numbers @xmath32 and @xmath33 are as yet unspecified , but one can easily see that by using only the @xmath32=0 value one recovers the original structure of @xmath29-shells because one then has @xmath33=@xmath29 and @xmath35=@xmath31 . in this case all fermion creation and annihilation operators commute with the inactive angular momentum , cf .",
    "( [ e15a ] ) .",
    "this situation is therefore identical to the one where the physical angular momentum @xmath12 itself belongs to the algebra @xmath5 and the inactive angular momentum @xmath21  ( [ e4 ] ) vanishes .",
    "every @xmath32-@xmath33-shell contains states with physical angular momenta @xmath29=@xmath37@xmath38@xmath39+@xmath33 .",
    "the structure of nuclear shells can therefore be embedded in the @xmath32-@xmath33 scheme in several ways .",
    "for example , the @xmath40-th major oscillator shell contains states with @xmath29=@xmath41 , @xmath42 and can be identified with the single @xmath32-@xmath33-shell either for @xmath33=@xmath43 and @xmath32=@xmath44 or for @xmath33=@xmath44 and @xmath32=@xmath43 the same nuclear shell can also be identified with two or more @xmath32-@xmath33-shells .",
    "for example , if one wants to take into account the fact that the highest @xmath29=@xmath45 multiplet of the @xmath40-th oscillator shell ( the intruder state ) is well separated from the other ones , one may consider it to be an @xmath32-scalar shell and identify the remaining multiplets as another @xmath32-@xmath33-shell .",
    "the fact that the fermion space is composed of @xmath32-@xmath33-shells allows one to construct some useful collective spectrum generating algebras @xmath5 .",
    "we may start by constructing a large algebra @xmath46 in the fermion space of the @xmath32-@xmath33-shells and then select only those generators which are scalar with respect to the inactive angular momentum @xmath21 . in this way we fulfill by construction assumption ( [ e2 ] ) . in the next section we present such a derivation for the case of a fermion space composed of a single @xmath32-@xmath33-shell .",
    "a generalization to the case of several @xmath32-@xmath33-shells is straightforward and will not be discussed here .",
    "the construction in the next section parallels the original derivation by ginocchio  @xcite who follows the ideas introduced in the pseudo - spin model  @xcite and uses the coupling of the _ half - integer _ pseudo - spin @xmath47 with the _ integer _ pseudo - orbital angular momentum @xmath48 to the total angular momentum @xmath29 .",
    "his starting point is the fermion space composed of a single @xmath48-@xmath47-shell in which he considers either @xmath48 or @xmath47 to be the inactive angular momentum .",

    "the notation focused on inactive and active angular momentum @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , rather then on integer and half - integer angular momenta @xmath48 and @xmath47 , as the former classification seems to be more fundamental .",

    "as shown in the appendix , the algebraic structure of pair operators @xmath72 is equivalent to that of _ fermion _ pairs occupying a single-@xmath33 shell for half - integer @xmath33 , or to that of _ boson _ pairs occupying a single-@xmath33 shell for integer @xmath33 .",

    "@xmath118 we may further decouple the @xmath227 and @xmath228 fermions by using the unitary transformation : @xmath229 where for @xmath59=0 one takes the non - zero result . in terms of fermions",
    "@xmath230 , the fermion pair creation operator is a sum of @xmath231 independent pairs for different @xmath59 values , i.e. , @xmath232 hence the algebra is the direct sum of @xmath231 identical copies of the pair algebra for fermions occupying a single-@xmath119 shell . since this shell contains @xmath233 states , the algebra in this case is so(2(2@xmath119 + 1 ) ) .    for half - integer @xmath118",
    "the decoupling of the @xmath227 and @xmath228 fermions is not possible .",
    "however , in this case the terms in eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) are _ symmetric _ with respect to exchanging the indices @xmath61 and @xmath62 and therefore they can be represented as pairs of _ bosons_. in fact we may define these boson pairs as @xmath234 where @xmath235 create bosons in the @xmath236 copies of the single-@xmath119 shell . note that in the case of half - integer @xmath118 there is no @xmath59=0 term in eq .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) .",
    "it is now easy to show that the algebra of the fermion pairs @xmath72 , @xmath69 and their commutators is identical to the algebra of the boson pairs @xmath237 , @xmath238 , and their commutators .",
    "it is important to note that one has to change the sign of the boson pair annihilation operator @xmath239 in order to obtain the identical algebras .",
    "it means that we use different real forms of both algebras and their representations are of course not equivalent .",
    "however , the angular momentum coupling does not depend on which real form is used .",
    "hence the calculations can be facilitated by working in the angular - momentum - uncoupled representation and we may use the commutation relations of boson operators @xmath240 to calculate those of the fermion operators @xmath241 . for bosons occupying the @xmath233 states of the single-@xmath119 shell",
    "the algebra of boson - pair operators is sp(2(2@xmath119 + 1 ) ) and such is therefore the generalized ginocchio algebra for half - integer @xmath118 .",
