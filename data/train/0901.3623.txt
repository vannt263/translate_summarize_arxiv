    "the theory of @xmath1-fr ' echet smooth approximations of continuous functions on banach spaces is well - developed , thanks to the work of many mathematicians , whose classical results and references can be found in the authoritative monograph @xcite .",
    "the known techniques rely on the use of @xmath1-fr ' echet smooth partititons of unity , resp .",
    "certain coordinatewise smooth embeddings into the space @xmath6 ( due to torunczyk @xcite ) .",
    "they are highly nonlinear , and even non - lipschitz in nature .",
    "for example , if the given function is lipschitz or has some uniform continuity , trying to preserve the lipschitzness of the approximating smooth functions leads to considerable additional technical difficulties ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is well - known that the ( apparently harder , and less developed ) parallel theory of approximations of norms on a banach space by @xmath1-fr ' echet smooth renormings requires different techniques .",
    "several open problems proposed in @xcite are addressing these issues .",
    "in particular , if a banach space admits an equivalent @xmath1-fr ' echet smooth renorming , is it possible to approximate ( uniformly on bounded sets ) all norms by @xmath1-fr ' echet smooth norms ? even in the separable case , the answer is not known in full generality , although the positive results in @xcite and @xcite are quite strong , and apply to most classical banach spaces . in the nonseparable",
    "setting , no general results are known , with a small exception of @xcite . in particular , one of the open problems in @xcite is whether on a given wcg banach space with an equivalent @xmath1-fr ' echet smooth norm , there exists an equivalent locally uniformly rotund ( lur ) norm which is a uniform limit on bounded sets of @xmath1-fr ' echet smooth norms .",
    "the notion of lur is of fundamental importance for renorming theory , and we refer to @xcite and the more recent @xcite for an extensive list of authors and results .",
    "such a result is of interest for several reasons .",
    "it can be used to obtain rather directly the uniform approximations of general continuous operators , by @xmath1-fr ' echet smooth ones . moreover , since lur norms form a residual set in the metric space of all equivalent norms on a banach space , a positive answer is to be expected .",
    "there is a closely related problem of obtaining a norm which shares simultaneously good rotundity and smoothness properties . by a famous result of asplund @xcite , on every separable asplund space there",
    "exists an equivalent norm which is simultaneously @xmath2-fr ' echet smooth and lur .",
    "a clever proof using baire category , and disposing of the separability condition on the underlying banach space , was devised in @xcite ( @xcite , ii.4.3 ) .",
    "the theorem holds in particular in all wcg asplund spaces ( in particular all reflexive spaces ) .",
    "its proof works under the assumption that the space admits an lur norm , as well as a norm whose dual is lur .",
    "it is well - known that dual lur implies that the original norm is @xmath2-fr ' echet smooth .",
    "however , using this approach one can not in general handle norms with higher degree of differentiability , even in the separable case .",
    "indeed , by @xcite ( @xcite , proposititon v.1.3 ) , a space admitting a lur and simultaneously @xmath7-fr ' echet smooth norm is superreflexive .",
    "there is not even a rotund and @xmath7-fr ' echet smooth norm on @xmath6 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , one can not even handle the proper case of lur and @xmath2-fr ' echet smooth norms .",
    "indeed , talagrand @xcite proved that @xmath8)$ ] admits an equivalent @xmath9-fr ' echet smooth norm , although it admits no dual lur renorming .",
    "the existence of lur renorming of this space follows from troyanski s theorem @xcite . in light of the previous results it is natural to ask whether this space has a @xmath2-fr ' echet smooth and simultaneously lur renorming .",
    "this question was posed on various occasions , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "our main result addresses both of the above mentioned open problems , namely higher smoothness approximation and simultaneous lur and @xmath2-smoothness . under reasonable assumptions ( e.g. for wld , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is valdivia compact , or @xmath12)$ ] , i.e. the space of continuous functions on the ordinal interval @xmath13 $ ] ) , it gives a renorming which is simultaneously @xmath2-fr ' echet smooth and lur , and admits a uniform approximation on bounded sets by @xmath1-fr ' echet norms . as a corollary we obtain a positive solution to both of the mentioned problems .",
