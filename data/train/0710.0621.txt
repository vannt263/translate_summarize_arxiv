    "it is well - established from surveys of the sky at euv and x - ray wavelengths that all stars with spectral types later than mid - f , except for giants later than mid - k , possess hot outer atmospheres akin to that of the sun ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while much observational and theoretical effort has been devoted to understanding solar coronal spectra and , in more recent years , toward understanding stellar coronal emission and spectra , comparatively little attention has been devoted to the reprocessing and line fluorescence resulting from this coronal emission by the underlying solar and stellar photospheres .",
    "in contrast , considerable effort has been spent on the study of x - ray reprocessing by `` cold '' gas in much more complex systems with more prominent fluorescent features but more uncertain geometries and physical conditions , such as the accretion disks around black holes and non - degenerate objects in x - ray binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the processes involved in photospheric fluorescence by coronal irradiation are the same as those discussed in these works ; the main difference here is in the specific geometry of the x - ray source above a quasi - neutral sphere and of the extended , shell - like nature of the coronal source above the photosphere during quiescent conditions .",
    "x - rays emitted from a hot ( @xmath3  k ) corona incident on the underlying photosphere can undergo either compton scattering or photoabsorption events through the ionization of atoms or weakly ionized species . through scattering events",
    ", photons can be reflected back in a direction towards the stellar surface where they have a finite chance of escape .",
    "compton scattering redistributes the spectrum to lower energies by @xmath4 per collision , where @xmath5 is the photon energy and @xmath6 the electron rest mass .",
    "the spectrum reflected from a stellar surface by scattering events is then shifted and broadened towards lower energies .",
    "photoionization events involving x - ray photons directed toward the photosphere are predominantly inner shell interactions with astrophysically abundant elements , the outer and valance cross - sections being very small at these energies .",
    "observable fluorescent lines can then arise as a result of the finite escape probabilities of photons emitted in outward directions by hole transitions in these atoms photoionized in their inner shells .",
    "these processes have been described in the solar context by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ( b79 ) , and more recently for arbitrarily photoionized slabs by @xcite .",
    "the strongest of the fluorescent lines for a plasma of approximately cosmic composition is the @xmath7-@xmath8 6.4  kev fe k@xmath2 doublet occurring following ejection of a @xmath9 electron .",
    "it has been observed in solar spectra on numerous occasions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the mechanism of fluorescence by the thermal x - ray coronal continuum was suggested by @xcite , and was firmly established on more theoretical grounds by @xcite and b79 .",
    "@xcite provided convincing observational confirmation based on flare spectra obtained by the _ solar maximum mission _ , though it has also been noted that contributions from non - thermal electron impact might also be present during hard x - ray bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "b79 pointed out that , for a given source spectrum , the observed flux of fe  k@xmath2 photons from the photosphere depends on essentially three parameters : the photospheric iron abundance ; the height of the emitting source ; and the heliocentric angle between the emitting source and observer .",
    "@xcite used fe k@xmath10 observations to probe the difference between the photospheric and coronal iron abundance for flares observed by the _ yohkoh _ satellite .",
    "more importantly for the stellar case , the spatial aspects of photospheric fluorescent line formation suggest its application to understanding the spatial distribution of coronal structures and flares on stars of different spectral type and activity level to the sun @xcite . indeed , fe  k fluorescence has recently been detected during flares on the active binary ii  peg @xcite and on the single giant hr  9024 @xcite .",
    "the fe  k line has also been seen in a growing sample of pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars @xcite , in which the line is thought to originate predominantly from the irradiated protoplanetary disk rather than the photosphere .    since the work of @xcite , there have been no concerted efforts to extend models of photospheric fluorescence for coronal excitation sources with other characteristics .",
    "fluorescent lines other than fe  k@xmath2 have also not yet , to our knowledge , been studied by other workers in any detail in this context .",
    "a reasonably strong feature observed in solar spectra near 17.62    had been identified with fe l@xmath2 photospheric fluorescence @xcite , but calculations of the expected line strength was shown by @xcite to be much too weak to explain the feature , and these authors instead identified the line with a transition in fe  xviii arising from configurational mixing and both seen in _ electron beam ion trap _ spectra and predicted by theory @xcite",
    ". however , given the potential diagnostic value of photospheric fluorescence , other lines , such as o  k@xmath2 , are possibly observable with very high quality observations and warrant further study .",
    "the capabilities of current x - ray missions such as _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , _ swift _ and _ suzaku _ to detect fluorescent lines further motivates a re - examination of the photospheric fluorescence problem in the context of stellar coronae , photospheres and protoplanetary disks .",
    "we restrict the study in hand to fe  k fluorescence from stellar photospheres and defer detailed discussions of protoplanetary disks and fluorescence from other elements to future work .",
    "in order to establish the atmospheric conditions under which fluorescence by , and compton scattering of , coronal x - rays take place , it is necessary to know where in a stellar atmosphere incident x - rays are absorbed . since the absorption cross - section for a cool plasma with solar , or near - solar , composition is a strong function of photon energy , the absorption of the coronal x - ray spectrum will take place at different levels in the atmosphere . to determine the characteristic height of absorption as a function of photon energy we have computed the optical depth for x - rays as a function of altitude in the solar atmosphere .",
    "we adopted the @xcite model c ( valc ) describing the solar atmospheric structure as a function of altitude , and used the photoionization cross - sections from @xcite and @xcite to compute the optical depth .",
    "the total absorption cross - section for a plasma with the solar chemical composition of @xcite ( gs ) in the energy range of interest for this study is illustrated in figure  [ f : cross ] for the case of both a neutral gas and a plasma in which all species are once - ionized ( this latter situation does not correspond to any physically valid thermal equilibrium condition , but is simply for comparative purposes ) .",
    "the height in the valc model corresponding to optical depth of unity for x - rays is illustrated in figure  [ f : depth ] .",
    "also illustrated is the atmospheric temperature as a function of height in this figure for comparison purposes . at the energy corresponding to the absorption edge of c , optical depth of unity",
    "is reached in the lower chromosphere , at temperatures of @xmath11  k and about 1000  km above the point where the continuum optical depth at 5000  , @xmath12 , is unity ( defined to be at a height of 0  km in this model ) . towards higher energies ,",
    "the decreasing photoabsorption cross - section leads to increasingly deeper penetration of coronal x - rays . at the fe k photoionization threshold energy ,",
    "the typical height of absorption is well into the photosphere and only 100  km or so above @xmath13 . at this point in the solar atmosphere , most fe is in the form of fe@xmath14 and the temperature is @xmath15  k.    number densities in this region of the valc model range from n@xmath16 down to @xmath17  @xmath18 and decrease roughly exponentially with an scale height @xmath19  km .",
    "thus the ionization parameter , @xmath20 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath21 is the ionizing photon flux per unit area , is small for even the strongest flares and x - ray photoionization of the photospheric gas is inconsequential .",
    "this is in contrast to models of , e.g. , x - ray irradiated accretion disks where the ionization state of the reflecting medium is governed by the incident hard photon flux and must be computed self - consistently with the emergent x - ray spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the range of heights in the photosphere where the x - ray photons are absorbed is very small compared with the stellar radius ( of order @xmath22-@xmath23  km ) , and the variation in temperature and ionization is also small over this altitude range ( figure  [ f : depth ] ) .",
    "we therefore approximate the photosphere by a geometrically thin but optically very thick shell of homogeneous density .",
    "we set the density to an arbitrarily high value such as to obtain the same behaviour as for a plane - parallel model where the photosphere is approximated by a cold semi - infinite slab with constant density .",
    "the appropriate atmospheric reference frame for describing the absorption , scattering and fluorescent processes is the mass or particle column depth and the calculations are independent of the absolute value of the density .",
    "provided plane - parallel geometry remains a good approximation , these calculations should therefore be valid for stars with different surface gravities and atmospheric pressures .    by assuming the photosphere to be cold",
    ", we make no distinction between fluorescence processes in species of different charge states . in typical late - type stellar",
    "photospheres the dominant species are neutral and once - ionized , for which the splitting between the respective fluorescence lines is very small as are differences in fluorescent yields @xcite .",
    "we also note that , as illustrated in figure  [ f : cross ] , in the energy range of interest here there is essentially no difference in the photoabsorption cross - sections for neutral or once - ionized species except at low energies where the difference is dominated by he and h. in reality , it is only the metals with fairly low first ionization potentials that are significantly ionized in the upper photosphere and lower chromosphere while he and h are almost entirely neutral .",
    "we use a modified version of the mc photoionization and radiative transfer code mocassin @xcite .",
    "this code uses a stochastic approach to the transfer of radiation which allows the construction of models of arbitrary geometry where all components of the radiation field are treated self - consistently .",
    "the basic idea is to employ a discrete description of the radiation field , whereby the simulation quanta are monochromatic packets of radiation of constant energy , @xmath24 , @xcite .",
    "the individual processes of scattering , absorption and re - emission of radiation can then be simulated by sampling probability density functions based on the medium opacities and emissivities , thus allowing the determination of the trajectories of packets as they leave the illuminating source(s ) and diffuse outward .",
    "these trajectories constitute the mc observable of our experiment which can be related to the mean intensity of the radiation field via the following mc estimator @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the volume of the current grid cell and the summation is over all the fragments of trajectory , @xmath27 , in @xmath26 , for packets with frequencies in the ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) interval .",
    "@xmath30 is the duration of the monte carlo experiment .",
    "the significance of this estimator may be most easily understood by considering that the energy density of the radiation field in ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) is @xmath31 . at each given instant",
    "a packet contributes energy @xmath24 to the volume element containing it .",
    "the time - averaged energy content of a volume element is given by the summation of the energy contribution of all packets crossing this volume element in the time interval @xmath30 .",
    "equation  1 follows from this argument , since each packet contributes @xmath32 to the time averaged energy content of a volume element and @xmath33  =  @xmath34 , where @xmath27 is the segment of the trajectory of a packet contained in the volume element .",
    "mocassin s atomic database is regularly updated and currently uses opacity data from @xcite and @xcite , energy levels , collision strengths and transition probabilities from version 5 of the chianti database ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and the improved hydrogen and helium free - bound continuous emission data recently published by @xcite .",
    "the @xcite photoabsorption cross - sections do no not include the resonance structure that can be prominent near ionisation thresholds . while this structure can be important for some astrophysical applications ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is not significant for the fluorescent efficiencies discussed here that depend primarily on broad - band spectral properties and neutral or once - ionised gas .    in the case of inner shell fek@xmath35 production ,",
    "the fluorescent luminosity , l(fek@xmath35 ) , due to the absorption of an incident energy packet of wavelength shorter than the fe k edge ( @xmath36  7.11  kev ) is calculated on the fly .",
    "the event of absorption of a high energy packet is immediately followed by the re - emission of a number , @xmath37 of fek@xmath35 packets from the same event location . for an incident packet of frequency @xmath28 , carrying energy @xmath24 in the unit time @xmath30 , the total fek@xmath35 emission is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the absorption opacity and the fek@xmath35 yield of @xmath41-times ionised iron , @xmath42 is the energy of the k@xmath2 line of i - times ionised iron ( @xmath436.4kev ) and the summation is over all abundant ionisation stages , @xmath44 is the absorption opacity due to all other abundant species and @xmath45 is the branching ratio between @xmath46 and @xmath47 fluorescence ( 0.882:0.118 , @xcite ) .",
    "we use a value of 0.34 for the fluorescence yields of neutral and once - ionised iron @xcite .",
    "the @xmath37 fek@xmath35 energy packets are emitted in random directions as the fluorescent emission process can be assumed to be isotropic . to ensure conservation , energy per unit time @xmath48",
    "must also be immediately re - emitted from the event location , at a frequency determined by sampling the local emissivity of the medium and transferred through the grid as described by @xcite .",
    "the fates of the newly emitted fek@xmath35 packets are determined by the absorption and compton opacities encountered along their diffusion paths .",
    "fek@xmath35 packets that are absorbed will be transformed into diffuse field packets or emission line packets at another energy and will not contribute to the emerging spectrum at 6.4kev .",
    "fek@xmath35 packets that are compton scattered will experience a change of direction and a shift in frequency ( by approximately @xmath49/@xmath50 ) , their new frequency and direction being determined using the klein - nishina formulae .",
    "these packets may therefore finally emerge and contribute to the low energy shoulder of the fe  k@xmath35 feature , or may undergo further scatterings and/or absorptions .",
    "the emergent integrated and the direction - dependent spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are finally calculated using all escaped energy packets , including contributions from compton reflected packets and fluorescence line packets .",
    "our method also allows us to easily separate the various components of the emergent sed .    since the study presented here",
    "is similar to the earlier b79 work , we summarise in brief the differences between these studies :    1 .",
    "b79 was aimed at understanding fe  k@xmath2 fluorescence in solar flares ; the possible utility of fluorescence for estimating the photospheric fe abundance ( which was of course more uncertain that at present ) was emphasised . the calculations presented here extend the parameter space so as to cover conditions found in large stellar flares and stars completely covered in x - ray emitting active regions ; our emphasis is on the use of fluorescence as a diagnostic of coronal and flare geometry on distant unresolved stars .",
    "2 .   input parameters used here are more up - to - date in several respects .",
    "input spectra have been computed using isothermal coronal plasma models whereas b79 used an analytical approximation to the bremsstrahlung continuum .",
    "b79 also adopted a simple form for absorption cross - sections of fe and the photospheric gas . here , photoabsorption cross - sections are computed self - consistently according to the chemical composition and ionisation state of the gas using analytical fits to opacity project data @xcite .",
    "these abundance - weighted cross - sections are about 40%  higher than that used by b79 for the gas with fe excluded ; the b79 cross - section for neutral fe k - shell absorption is about 20%  larger than that of @xcite at threshold , but very similar at energies above 8  kev .",
    "as we shall see below , these differences have little influence on the resulting fluorescence efficiencies , largely because the fe cross - section dominates and differences here are small .",
    "b79 assumed that once a fe  k@xmath2 line photon is compton scattered it is `` lost '' due to the shift in energy . here",
    ", we follow all photons until they emerge from the photosphere and therefore also resolve the compton shoulders comprising scattered line photons .      in order to establish the robustness of our new code",
    ", we first examine the fek@xmath35 problem for point - like solar flares using the full 3d geometry of our models and fully self - consistent radiative transfer , treating photoabsorption contributions from all abundant atoms and ions , and ( compton ) scattering by electrons . as a benchmark",
    ", we attempt to reproduce the earlier results of b79 .",
    "the photon density spectrum of the incident x - rays , @xmath51 , is taken to follow the same bremsstrahlung power - law with energy , @xmath52 , as defined in b79 : @xmath53 we consider four x - ray temperatures ( 0.5 , 1.0 , 3.0 , 5.0  kev ) and two flare heights , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which cover the full parameter space investigated by b79 . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we will quote temperatures in degrees k , however in this section these are given in kev , which are the units used by b79 .",
    "for the sake of comparison , we used the fe abundance adopted by b79 of @xmath56/@xmath57 by number ; for other elements we adopted the mixture of gs . in table",
    "[ t : baiht ] we compare our results for the iron k@xmath2 fluorescence efficiency , @xmath58 , to those of b79 ( values in brackets ) .",
    "@xmath58 is defined as the ratio of the total luminosity of iron k@xmath2 photons emitted from the photosphere and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , with @xmath51 given by equation  [ e : baispe ] .    in this formulation",
    "the flux of fek@xmath35 photons received at earth is equal to @xmath61 where d is the distance from the source and @xmath62 the heliocentric angle subtended by the flare and observer .",
    "the agreement with the results of b79 is generally very good , and significantly better at higher x - ray temperatures ; discrepancies amount to only 18%  for x - ray temperatures of 0.5  kev .",
    "we attribute the bulk of the differences in fluorescent efficiencies to the use by b79 of slightly different absorption cross - sections and an analytical approximation for the gas opacities , while we calculate these self - consistently according to the elemental abundances considered in our models .",
    "the slight temperature dependence in the differences is most likely due to the different slopes of the b79 functional form and our calculations , which take into account all elements with z@xmath6330 .",
    "our 3d models allow us to obtain the spectral energy distribution emerging from arbitrary viewing angles . in figure",
    "[ f : ftheta ] we show the variation of @xmath64 for ten heliocentric angles from @xmath65 to @xmath66 for two flare heights ( @xmath54 and @xmath67 ) .",
    "these plots are directly comparable with the top - left and bottom - right panels of figure  3 of b79 and show good agreement with his results .",
    "finally , in figure  [ f : abun ] we show the variation of @xmath58 as a function of iron abundance .",
    "again , our results are in good agreement with those of b79 ( _ cf _ his figure  4 ) and show that the relation of the fek@xmath35 fluorescence efficiency on the photospheric iron abundance is weaker than a proportional relation , as expected .",
    "we discuss the fe dependence of the fe  k@xmath2 flux in more detail in ",
    "[ s : fesens ] below .",
    "having in the previous section established the robustness of our methods , we present the results from a new grid of model calculations designed to provide useful diagnostics for fek@xmath35 detections for a wider range of stellar environments .",
    "in particular , stellar coronae cover a much wider range of temperatures and fe abundance than the solar case and investigation of fluorescence over a wider range of parameters will be necessary for correct interpretation of fluorescent lines from stars .",
    "we investigate two geometrical configurations : ( i ) a single flare and ( ii ) an active corona that can be approximated by a spherical shell illuminating a photosphere from particular scale height @xmath68 .",
    "while coronae are of course not expected to conform to a shell - like geometry , this case should approximate quite well the case in which a star is quasi - uniformly covered in active regions .",
    "coronal fluorescing spectra were adopted from a grid of isothermal models computed using emissivities from the chianti compilation of atomic data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , together with ion populations from @xcite , as implemented in the pintofale idl software suit @xcite .",
    "we adopted the chemical composition of gs for all calculations except where noted . while there will be some contribution from transitions in he - like and h - like ni and the higher lyman series of he - like and h - like fe to the ionising photon flux @xmath69 , this is small compared with the integrated continuum contribution ; consequently the metallicity sensitivity for the ionising spectrum is generally negligible for realistic ranges of metallicity .      in the case of a single flare illuminating a photosphere from a given height , the heliocentric angle , @xmath62 , has a dramatic effect on the fek@xmath35 flux detected .",
    "the intrinsic fek@xmath35 efficiency , @xmath58 , is , of course , independent of @xmath62 , being a function of the fluorescing spectrum , the flare height and the relative iron abundance .",
    "using gs solar abundances for all elements with @xmath70 we show in table  [ t : feka1 ] the fek@xmath35 efficiency , @xmath58 , predicted for x - ray temperatures in the range @xmath718.0  kev and flare height in stellar radii in the range @xmath54@xmath72 .    in order to investigate the fek@xmath35 line strength as a function of heliocentric angle , we calculated @xmath64 for a number of angles at each flare height .",
    "for convenience we fit our results using 4th or 5th order polynomials , such that @xmath73 .",
    "the fit coefficients are listed in table  [ t : fthetafits ] and the resulting @xmath64 functions are plotted in figure  [ f : fthetafits ] .",
    "our fits are valid between heliocentric angles 0@xmath74 and 100@xmath74 ; the maximum errors between our data and the fits at each flare height are also listed as percentages in table  [ t : fthetafits ] and are less than 2.4% .",
    "these functions illuminate interesting characteristics of the fluorescence problem for different incidence and exit angles .",
    "firstly , we point out that for finite flare heights @xmath68 , @xmath64 is non - zero for angles @xmath75 .",
    "this is simply due to the surface illumination from flares beyond the limb extending onto the visible hemisphere : the angle at which @xmath64 reaches 0 is given geometrically by @xmath76 .",
    "we note , however , that we did not explore the very low - response tail of @xmath64 for heliocentric angles greater than @xmath77 , as the fe  k@xmath2 flux , although finite for some flare heights , is too small to be detectable even for very strong flares .",
    "furthermore , @xmath64 falls below the statistical variance of our models at these large angles .",
    "the general decrease of @xmath64 with increasing @xmath62 present in all curves is largely a result of the @xmath78 increase in path length required for k@xmath2 photons to escape .",
    "the most conspicuous characteristic of @xmath64 behaviour with different heights is the steepening of the decline from smaller to larger angles with increasing flare height .",
    "this arises because of the range of incidence angles of flare photons on the photosphere . as @xmath79",
    ", incidence angles relative to the photospheric normal become smaller and the average penetration depth before interaction by either absorption or scattering events is larger . consequently",
    ", path lengths increase and fe  k@xmath2 escape probabilities decrease",
    ". folded in with this is the decreasing fraction of photons incident on the visible hemisphere of the star with increasing @xmath62 .",
    "the calculations for @xmath64 and @xmath58 can be readily adapted from the point source case to one in which the corona is approximated by a spherical shell of emission , as might be the case for stars significantly more active than the sun .",
    "this can be seen by taking the shell case to be a large ensemble of point sources distributed uniformly about the star for which the observed fluorescent flux is then simply the solid angle average of the point source case , @xmath80 since , following from the definition of @xmath58 and our equation  4 , @xmath81 , the flux is @xmath82 by tailoring the solid angle integral in equation  [ e : shell ] the fluorescent flux for an arbitrary coverage pattern of active regions viewed from any angle can be derived from the tabulated values of @xmath64 and @xmath58 .",
    "the fluorescence efficiency , @xmath58 , is illustrated as a function of the isothermal plasma temperature adopted for the ionising coronal spectrum in figure  [ f : vst ] .",
    "we find @xmath58 varies very slowly with temperature , decreasing by only a factor of @xmath83 over a factor of 30 or more in temperature .",
    "this gradual decrease is predominantly a result of the competition between fe inner - shell absorption and compton scattering .",
    "as temperatures increase , incident photons are present at higher and higher energies . since the fe cross - section declines with increasing photon energy while the compton cross - section remains constant , higher energy photons are more liable to be scattered out of the photosphere before being destroyed by photoabsorption .      in the optically - thick fluorescence case",
    "such as characterizes the photospheric fluorescence problem , inner - shell photoabsorption by fe atoms and ions competes with the background opacity from other elements .",
    "observed fe  k@xmath2 line fluxes and equivalent widths are then expected to vary predominantly according to the _ relative _ fe abundance rather than just the photospheric metallicity .",
    "note that the optically - thick situation differs to the optically - thin formalism discussed by @xcite and referred to in the discussion of stellar and protostellar fe  k@xmath2 lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : in the optically - thin case the fluorescent fe line strength is primarily a function of the absorbing fe column .    in extension to the benchmark calculations discussed in  [ s : bench ] , we have computed the sensitivity of @xmath84 to the fe abundance for a model fluorescing spectrum with a temperature of 10@xmath85  k and fe abundance in the range @xmath86[fe / h]@xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "this temperature was chosen to be representative of a typical very active corona or moderate stellar flare .",
    "trends with [ fe / h ] are expected to be only weakly sensitive to this adopted temperature , the fluorescence efficiency , @xmath58 , varying only very slowly with @xmath89 ( figure  [ f : vst ] ) .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure  [ f : vsfeabun ] where we show @xmath58 normalised to its value at the gs solar fe abundance in comparison to the proportional relation , analogous to figure  [ f : abun ] discussed in ",
    "[ s : bench ] and figure  4 of b79 .",
    "the fluorescence line strength vs fe abundance was investigated in the context of accretion disks by @xcite , and our results are comparable to figures  1 and 2 from that work for the range of fe abundance in common . as noted above , b79 showed that the relationship between the relative fluorescence efficiency @xmath58 and the fe abundances is weaker than a proportional relation .",
    "in fact , the relation increasingly departs from proportionality with increasing fe abundance .",
    "this behaviour arises because of the equipartition of photoabsorption between the different species present in the atmosphere . at low fe abundance",
    "when the background cross - section due to elements other than fe dominate , @xmath84 varies according to @xmath90 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the fe @xmath93 shell and total plasma absorption cross - sections , respectively . at very large fe abundance , the photoionization cross - section of fe will begin to dominate @xmath92 ; @xmath94 then tends to asymptote to the constant ratio @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the total fe photoabsorption cross - section from levels @xmath97 .",
    "we do not consider such large fe abundances here ; this asymptotic behaviour is nicely illustrated by @xcite .",
    "the relationship is further complicated to some extent by the role of compton scattering , but this becomes less relevant for higher fe abundances for which photoabsorption dominates compton scattering out to higher energies .",
    "also illustrated in figure  [ f : vsfeabun ] is the relative fluorescence efficiency for different photospheric",
    "_ metallicity _",
    "( ie where all metal abundances are scaled together ) for the range @xmath98[m / h]@xmath99 relative to the gs solar mixture .",
    "as expected , the fluorescent efficiency is not so sensitive to [ m / h ] because of the tendency of @xmath84 to follow the relations above between the different opacity sources : adjusting the metallicity as a whole results in a smaller change in @xmath100 since @xmath92 is by definition in lockstep with metallicity .",
    "as metallicity decreases , compton scattering and the background h and he cross - sections become more important , the combined effect of which is to weaken @xmath84 in comparison to the higher metallicity case . for very high metallicities ,",
    "these opacity sources are negligible and the fluorescence efficiency asymptotes to the value given by @xmath90 .",
    "the main scientific motivation for this work is to provide the foundation to use fe fluorescence as a quantitative diagnostic of coronal and flare geometry .",
    "there now exists a handful of detections of fluorescent emission from stars .",
    "sensitivity is currently limited to a large extent by the low spectral resolution of available instruments and progress is expected to accelerate dramatically with the future availability of x - ray calorimeters .",
    "since modern x - ray spectral analyses based on low - resolution ccd pulse - height spectra tend to express line strengths in terms of the line equivalent width , we have computed this quantity for the case of @xmath101 and the ranges of heights and x - ray temperatures investigated in  [ s : newcalcs ] .",
    "the equivalent width in this context refers to the fluorescent , processed line seen on top of the continuum of the ionising coronal spectrum .",
    "while the @xmath101 case gives the most optimistic line strength , we note that @xmath64 is quite slowly varying for angles @xmath102 for the flare heights for which significant fek@xmath35 might be observed .",
    "the equivalent widths are illustrated in figure  [ f : ew ] and listed in table  [ t : fekaew1 ] .",
    "the observability of the cold fe  k@xmath2 line is of course strongly dependent on the quality of the x - ray spectrum obtained .",
    "the most extensive study of pms fe fluorescence to date is that based on chandra observations of the orion nebula cluster by @xcite .",
    "this study detected significant 6.4  kev excesses attributable to fe fluorescence for 7 out of 127 sources found to have significant counts in the 6 - 9  kev band .",
    "equivalent widths were in the range 110 - 270  ev at plasma temperatures of @xmath103 - 10  kev .",
    "there is clearly a strong selection effect here and these fluorescent line strengths likely represent the upper end of the distribution .",
    "our calculations for a flare at scale height @xmath104 are also appropriate for a flare occurring above an infinite plane , such as might approximate a disk - encircled pms star . as in the photospheric case",
    ", the fluorescence problem can be treated orthogonally from the ionisation structure of the disk , which is not greatly altered from its very largely neutral overall state by x - rays from a typical flare .",
    "any small degree of x - ray photoionisation will also not affect fe  k@xmath2 line strengths because fluorescence yields are essentially invariant for lower fe ions .",
    "our calculations indicate that attaining equivalent widths much in excess of 100  ev is not straightforward for such a simple geometry for the plasma temperatures observed in the fluorescing x - ray spectra .",
    "this finding is in agreement with earlier calculations by @xcite and @xcite , who find equivalent widths of @xmath105  ev for a flat disk illuminated by x - rays with power - law photon spectral energy distributions .",
    "there are at least four ways in which equivalent widths might be elevated above the values we find : ( 1 ) super - solar fe abundance in the disk material , possibly arising as a result of an elevated dust - to - gas ratio ; ( 2 ) disk flaring , resulting in a solid angle coverage @xmath106 ; ( 3 ) line - of - sight obscuration of the central flaring source ( but not fluorescent line photons ) by optically thick structures such as the star itself ( ie the flare occurring on the far hemisphere ) ; and ( 4 ) fluorescence contributions from ionisation by non - thermal electrons .    by analogy with the solar case ,",
    "in which excitation by non - thermal electrons is usually negligible @xcite and is much more difficult on energetic grounds , we consider ( 4 ) the _ least _ plausible of these .",
    "@xcite have also shown in the accretion disk context that fe  k production by non - thermal electron bombardment requires 2 - 4 orders of magnitude greater energy dissipation in the electron beam than is required for an x - ray photoionization source .",
    "disk flaring can give rise to increased line strengths by factors @xmath107 simply from consideration of the increased solid angle coverage possible compared with an infinite flat disk .",
    "it is also difficult to envisage enhanced fe abundances in the disk being able to elevate line strengths by more than a factor of a few . of some interest , then , is the observation of an fe  k@xmath2 line equivalent width of @xmath108  m  during the rise phase of a flare on the pms orion nebula star forming region object v  1486  ori by @xcite .",
    "such an enhancement over an infinite disk value of @xmath105  m , even with a large degree of disk flaring , would still require extreme enhancements of the disk fe abundance by an order of magnitude or more ( e.g.  [ s : fesens ] and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were the line due to photoionisation by the _ directly observed _ continuum .",
    "we point out , however , that fluorescent line photons from a pms disk can still be observed when the x - ray flaring source is located behind the star and obscured from the line - of - sight . in the case of the v  1486  ori flare ,",
    "the large observed fe  k@xmath2 equivalent width is simply and plausibly associated with a partially obscured flare whose rise phase was not fully observed directly owing to line - of - sight obscuration by the star itself .",
    "such obscured flares will inevitably be the cause of some fraction of observed fe  k@xmath2 lines from pms stellar disks .",
    "this explanation is also more consistent than one relying on preferential disk geometry and fe abundance with the non - detection of fe  k@xmath2 from a second less extreme flare whose impulsive phase instead appears to have been quite visible .      the strong flare in ii  peg observed by _",
    "swift _ and analysed by @xcite presents another interesting case .",
    "photospheric fe  k@xmath2 was clearly detected throughout the event .",
    "equivalent widths for different times in the flare ranged from 18 to 61  ev , with uncertainties in the 20 - 45%  range .",
    "the authors favoured a collisional excitation mechanism for the line , arguing that fluorescence would be unlikely to produce an observable feature .",
    "this assessment employed a simple analytical formula applicable to optically - thin cases in which only a minor fraction of the incident x - ray flux is subject to photoabsorption or scattering ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite correctly noted that the path length required to obtain the observed equivalent widths under such an approximation was similar to the @xmath109 compton scattering depth , but discounted fluorescence as a possibility on these grounds .",
    "other than the inapplicability of the optically - thin formula for the photospheric fluorescence case , one reason such an argument is overly pessimistic is that incidence angles on the photosphere range from @xmath110@xmath111 for small scale heights and path lengths for escape are less than penetration depths by the factor of the inverse cosine of these angles .",
    "we defer a more detailed treatment of the event to future work , but note here that equivalent widths of 50  ev are achieved for flare heights up to @xmath112 or so for the @xmath113  k model in our grid , a temperature similar to the average of the values found for the flare by @xcite . while collisional ionisation can not be ruled out observationally as the source of the observed fe fluorescence , it is not a requirement .",
    "we have investigated the production of fe  k@xmath2 fluorescence lines by irradiation from coronal and flare emission using a 3-dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer approach including compton redistribution .",
    "the results are presented in the form of convenient tables describing the fluorescence efficiency as a function of the flare height , the temperature of the ionising x - ray spectrum , and the viewing angle .",
    "we have also illustrated how the fluorescent efficiencies scale with the photospheric metallicity and the fe abundance .",
    "the results should be of use for interpreting observations of fe  k@xmath2 lines seen from stars .",
    "our computed fe  k@xmath2 equivalent widths for irradiation from a height of zero above the photosphere correspond to the case of flares above a disk of infinite extent and are relevant to observations of fluorescence from pms stars . observed equivalent widths tend to be slightly larger than our computed ones for a plasma of solar composition and are an indication of flaring disk geometries or super - solar fe abundances .",
    "for one extreme case recently observed on v  1486  ori , we propose that the very large equivalent width observed ( @xmath1  m ) arose from x - ray fluorescence by a flare partially obscured from the line - of - sight by the stellar limb .",
    "the fek@xmath2 equivalent width reported for a large flare on ii  peg is consistent with our computed values for a flare scale height of a few tenths of a stellar radius , and a collisional excitation mechanism is not a requirement .",
