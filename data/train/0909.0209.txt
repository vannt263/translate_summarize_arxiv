    "ordered double perovskites of the composition @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 an alkaline earth , @xmath8 a magnetic transition metal ion , and @xmath9 a non - magnetic ion ) have come again into the focus of research because of their interesting magnetic properties .",
    "first , in sr@xmath5femoo@xmath2 a large room - temperature magnetoresistance was observed @xcite .",
    "second , within the group of ferrimagnetic double perovskites materials with higher curie - temperatures , @xmath10 , than in the simple perovskites ( e.g.  doped manganites ) can be obtained . at the moment",
    "the highest @xmath10 values have been reported for sr@xmath5crreo@xmath2 ( @xmath11k ) @xcite and sr@xmath5croso@xmath2 ( @xmath12k ) @xcite .",
    "third , the mechanism leading to magnetic coupling is believed to be associated with a strong tendency to a half - metallic nature of the charge carriers at the fermi level @xcite . clearly , these materials are interesting candidates for spintronic applications @xcite , in particular when having in mind fully epitaxial structures based on perovskite materials .",
    "recently , majewski _",
    "et al . _ and",
    "sikora _ et al . _",
    "have proposed a simple scaling law between the curie - temperature and the induced magnetic moment at the non - magnetic site in the double perovskite structure @xcite .",
    "have discussed that a high curie - temperature is associated with a tolerance factor close to one for the corresponding crystal @xcite .",
    "the only exception for this rule is found in the series @xmath1fereo@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ba , sr , ca ) . in this particular",
    "fere - system it is the strongly monoclinically distorted ca - based compound having an anomally high @xmath10 , namely about 540k @xcite ( comparing to about 400k for sr@xmath5fereo@xmath2 @xcite and 325k for ba@xmath5fereo@xmath2 @xcite ) . the dimensionless tolerance factor , @xmath13 , in @xmath1fereo@xmath2 whose deviation from unity implies structural distortion varies from about @xmath14 for @xmath3 ba over @xmath15 for @xmath3 sr to @xmath16 for @xmath3 ca @xcite . in general , the ba - based ferrimagnetic double perovskites are close to a structural transition into a hexagonal lattice where ferro(i)magnetism is not allowed for symmetry reasons ; the sr - based compounds are always close to a perfect cubic structure with maximal @xmath10 , and the ca - based double perovskites are orthorhombically or monoclinically distorted , with still a large but - due to the reduced exchange - clearly reduced ferrimagnetic transition temperature .",
    "the exceptional large @xmath10 of ca@xmath5fereo@xmath2 is accompanied by an insulating state at low temperatures , in contrast to sr@xmath5fereo@xmath2 or even the similarly monoclinically distorted ca@xmath5femoo@xmath2 which both are metallic @xcite .",
    "the metal - insulator transition in ca@xmath5fereo@xmath2 has been reported to occur between 100 and 150k @xcite .",
    "this behavior has been attributed to strongly enhanced electron - electron correlations on the re site due to a reduced transfer integral between fe and re corresponding to an extremely large effective coulomb repulsion , @xmath17 , of about 4ev on both ions @xcite .",
    "this , however , is in some contradiction to the observed high curie - temperature , which is believed to be a consequence of a kinetic energy gain due to the hybridization of the fe @xmath18 and re @xmath0 @xmath19-orbitals .",
    "the prediction that a decreased band - filling is favorable for @xmath10 @xcite , which could be used to conciliate a high @xmath10 with a reduced re - re overlap , has turned out to be not valid : an increased band - filling actually leads to a strong @xmath10 enhancement for both the femo - system @xcite and the crw - system @xcite . within the kinetically driven exchange model @xcite , the increase of @xmath10",
    "is more naturally explained as a consequence of increased band - filling .",
    "note , that the cases of ca@xmath5fereo@xmath2 and sr@xmath5croso@xmath2 , both being insulating and having a high @xmath10 at the same time , are completely different : in the case of sr@xmath5croso@xmath2 having only a tiny rhombohedral distortion , the os @xmath0 @xmath20 band is completely filled , while for ca@xmath5fereo@xmath2 it is the structural distortion that drives the metal - insulator transition .",
    "recently , it was suggested that in double perovskites with heavy ions as re a large orbital contribution to the magnetic moment leads to an enhanced total magnetization above the integer value that is expected for a half - metallic material @xcite .",
    "this elsewhere predicted and calculated @xcite strong influence of spin - orbit coupling leads to a quasi - half metallicity which still is from the view point of applications in spintronics very high ( above 90% ) .",
    "another point of interest is the possibility of an _ intrinsic _ enhancement of the re spin magnetic moment due to the peculiar re@xmath21 state in the ferrimagnetic double perovskites . in this study",
    ", we present the xmcd analysis of the system @xmath1fereo@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ba , sr , ca ) , compare the experimental data to theoretical predictions calculated within the full - potential linear muffin - tin orbital method ( fp - lmto ) @xcite with included spin - orbit coupling , and complete the so far suggested scaling law @xcite by using the identical method to extract separately spin and orbital magnetic moments .",
    "furthermore , we search for a contribution of the alkaline earth element to the magnetic behavior , and also look for an _ intrinsic _ re moment in a suited double perovskite compound with @xmath8 being a non - magnetic ion : sr@xmath5screo@xmath2 .",
    ".[tab : samp ] summary of sample properties from x - ray diffraction at 300k ( calculated by rietfeld - refinement ) and squid magnetometry . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper , the xanes spectra themselves are not further discussed . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmcd ] , for fere - compounds at both absorption edges we find a rather intense xmcd signal .",
    "this is a clear evidence for the existence of a magnetic moment at the re @xmath0 shell .",
    "for all three compounds , the xmcd spectra at the @xmath22 edge are largest ( as expected for @xmath23 orbitals ) and similar in shape . in ca@xmath5fereo@xmath2",
    "the size of the xmcd signal is by a factor of 2 smaller compared to the two other fere compounds . at the @xmath24 edge",
    ", the ca - based double perovskite again stands out by a pronounced peak with negative xmcd signal which is absent for sr@xmath5fereo@xmath2 and ba@xmath5fereo@xmath2 .",
    "the data at the @xmath24 edge look slightly different in amplitude as compared to previously published data @xcite .",
    "however , the data are consistent in that the integrated xmcd intensity at the @xmath24 edge is negative only in the case of ca@xmath5fereo@xmath2 . in this sense",
    ", all data support the unusual behavior of ca@xmath5fereo@xmath2 , which can not only be attributed to the different ionic size of the @xmath7 site ions .    in fig .",
    "[ xmcd : sc ] we show xanes and xmcd spectra for the compound sr@xmath5screo@xmath2 .",
    "this compound is important because the absence of any free electrons at sc@xmath25 which has a @xmath26 configuration will lead to a complete breakdown of the _ induced _ magnetic moment at the re site .",
    "this compound therefore allows the measurement of the _ intrinsic _ magnetic moment of re@xmath21 ( also in contrast to re@xmath27 compounds as sr@xmath5mgreo@xmath2 ) .",
    "previously , kato _ et al .",
    "_ have calculated from a curie - weiss fit to the susceptibility an effective magnetic moment of re in sr@xmath5screo@xmath2 of about 1.1@xmath28 , as expected within the ionic picture @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our data show the existence of a much smaller , but finite intrinsic moment at the re site , indicating an increased tendency to magnetic ordering of re@xmath21 . since this moment is present above the antiferromagnetic transition temperature , it is not related to spin glass behavior .",
    "the spin magnetic moment is about 50 times smaller than corresponding induced moments on re@xmath21 , and the orbital magnetic moments even by a factor of 100 .",
    "however , due to the high sensitivity of the set - up at esrf , one can unambiguously prove the existence of this moment .",
    "in contrast to the opposite sign of the induced magnetic moment with respect to the applied field , the spin magnetic moment at the re in sr@xmath5screo@xmath2 is aligned with the field .",
    "this is expected because the kinetic exchange via fully polarized spin down is not at work .",
    "this intrinsic moment of re@xmath21 therefore has to be considered as an indicator of the tendency to unusually high magnetization of re based double perovskites .    as a last point , we address magnetism in the earth alkaline ions itself , which usually are completely neglected in the magnetic scenario . the xanes and xmcd spectra of the ba @xmath22 and @xmath24 edges of ba@xmath5fereo@xmath2 and of the ca @xmath29-edge of ca@xmath5fereo@xmath2",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ xmcd : ba ] . the @xmath0 spin magnetic moment ( calculated with 9 as the number of @xmath30-holes corresponding to the band - structure calculation ) of ba is @xmath31 and the @xmath0 orbital magnetic moment @xmath32 ( both in @xmath33f.u . ) , @xmath34 .",
    "the theoretical predictions calculated as described elsewhere @xcite are @xmath35 and @xmath36 which is in fair agreement with our experimental data .",
    "for ca@xmath5fereo@xmath2 we can only qualitatively say that a finite magnetic moment is observed , because the @xmath29-edge probes only the @xmath37 orbital magnetism .",
    "since the @xmath38 edges are experimentally not accessible , a quantative analysis can not be done .",
    "the observation of a magnetically polarized density of states gives clear evidence for a magnetic interaction of the earth alkaline ions with the other ions .",
    "the magnetic contribution of ba in this case is a factor of 2 smaller than the contribution of the intrinsic re moment .",
    "naturally , one expects that the magnetic contribution increases with ionic size due to the increased exchange with the neighboring ions .",
    "the clear orbital contribution in ba@xmath5fereo@xmath2 is not unexpected due to the heavy ionic mass .",
    "our data provide a test for a detailed theoretical study of the magnetism in the double perovskites , and underlines the importance of taking spin - orbit coupling into account .",
    "note , that for example in cro@xmath5 , where the importance of oxygen in the magnetic mechanism is undoubted , comparable values of spin and orbital moments of the oxygen ion have been measured @xcite as compared to our results on ba in ba@xmath5fereo@xmath2 .    in table",
    "[ tab : table1 ] we summarize our results for the spin and orbital magnetic moments at the re site as derived from the xmcd measurements by applying the standard sum rules @xcite and compare them to theoretical values .",
    "also , the ratio @xmath39 is calculated , since this quantity is not affected by possible uncertainties in the calculated number of holes . in general , the calculated data are in surprisingly good agreement with the measured data .",
    "one of the main reasons certainly is , that spin - orbit coupling is taken into account from the beginning .",
    "note , that in the hard x - ray range the sum rules apply with high validity due to the large spin - orbit splitting of the core level .",
    "let us finally discuss again our data for the three fere - based compounds .",
    "our data are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with literature data with one exception : ca@xmath5fereo@xmath2 . while sikora _",
    "_ @xcite find , that the spin magnetic moment of re in ca@xmath5fereo@xmath2 scales with the high @xmath10 , in our case it has the lowest spin magnetic moment , letting ca@xmath5fereo@xmath2 stand out from the scaling law @xcite which so far holds in all other cases .",
    "this behavior is certainly more natural , since one expects that a reduced exchange will also lead to a reduced spin magnetic moment on the re site .",
    "note that the ratio of orbital and spin magnetic moments are consistent with the previous data . as suggested previously by kato _",
    "@xcite , a re @xmath40 orbital ordered state or its glass - state analog associated with the monoclinic lattice distortion occurs , pointing out the importance of correlation effects in this compound .",
    "recently , sikora _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a scenario with a complex competition between two phases with different electronic and crystallographic structure .",
    "our data give further indication that ca@xmath5fereo@xmath2 is exceptional among the double perovskites due to the strong octahedral - site distortions .",
    "in summary , we have elucidated the re magnetic moments in the fere - based series of double perovskites as a function of the earth alkaline ion , confirming the exceptional position of ca@xmath5fereo@xmath2 .",
    "we have measured a finite _ intrinsic _ magnetic moment at the re@xmath21 site in sr@xmath5screo@xmath2 indicating the tendency to enhanced magnetic moments observed in re based double perovskites .",
    "furthermore , for the first time we were able to measure by xmcd the magnetic moments directly at the alkaline earth site itself .",
    "our result shows that the usually neglected ca and ba ions play a role in the magnetic scenario of the kinetically driven exchange model , comparable in size to the role of oxygen ."
