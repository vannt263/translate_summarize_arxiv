    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are semi  detached binaries with a white dwarf ( wd ) primary and a low  mass main  sequence companion that transfers mass to the wd through roche  lobe overflow ( e.g.  warner 1995 ) .",
    "orbital periods are known for about 400 systems .",
    "two marked features stand out in the orbital period distribution : a dearth of systems in the range 2 - 3  hr , usually referred to as the `` period gap '' , and a sharp short  period cut  off at @xmath1  min , the `` period minimum '' @xmath2 ( e.g.  ritter & kolb 1998 ) .",
    "j01326554 at @xmath3  min currently marks the short end of the bulk of the distribution , while the single system v485 cen at @xmath4  min is the notable exception .",

    ". the density increases for donors evolving along the hydrogen  burning main sequence towards smaller mass . approaching the hydrogen ",
    "burning minimum mass the increasing electron degeneracy induces structural changes such that further mass loss reduces @xmath5 .",
    "hence during the donor s transition from a main  sequence star to a brown dwarf ( bd ) the secular mean orbital period derivative changes from negative to positive .",
    "this `` period bounce '' has long been identified with the minimum period of cvs ( paczyski 1981 , paczyski & sienkiewicz 1981 ; rappaport , joss & webbink 1982 ; dantona & mazzitelli 1982 ) .",
    "the actual period @xmath11 at which a cv bounces depends on the ratio @xmath12 of the secondary s thermal time @xmath13 and mass transfer time @xmath14 , the characteristic timescales restoring and perturbing equilibrium . if @xmath15 is small @xmath2 is short .",
    "hence @xmath11 is sensitive both to the orbital angular momentum loss rate ( which determines the transfer rate @xmath16 ) and to the interior structure of the donor .",
    "paczyski ( 1981 ) was the first to point out that @xmath11 is close to 80 min if gravitational wave radiation drives the mass transfer .",
    "since then , models with different input physics have been employed to verify a quantitative agreement between the observed @xmath2 and the calculated @xmath11 .",
    "recent calculations ( kolb & ritter 1992 ; howell , rappaport & politano 1997 ) notoriously give @xmath11 too short by typically 10% .",
    "most of these evolutionary calculations are based on input physics which is rather approximate for very low mass ( vlm ) objects , i.e.  donors with mass @xmath17 . because of their relatively high central densities and low central temperatures , correlation effects between particles dominate and must be taken into account in the equation of state ( cf .",

    " mass stellar / substellar objects , the theory describing them has improved considerably in the past few years . as a result",

    "[ tides ] ) , and address the problem of the missing `` period spike '' at @xmath2 ( sect .",
    "[ phisto ] ) .",
    "this predicted accumulation of systems at @xmath11 is caused by the slow velocity in period space close to period bounce which increases the detection probability .",
    "the spike has been a dominant feature in synthesized period distributions obtained from theoretical cv population models ( kolb 1993 ; kolb et al .",
    "1998 ) , yet is absent in the observed cv period distribution . in these earlier population models",
    "the donor star was approximated as a ( bi)polytrope , and cvs forming with a donor mass smaller than @xmath20  @xmath21 were not considered .",
    "here we investigate if the period spike persists in period distributions synthesized from full bcah models .",
    "for the first time , we include cvs which form already with bd donors , i.e.systems which did not evolve through period bounce . in sect .",
    "[ disc ] alternative explanations for the missing period spike are discussed . in particular , we focus on the difference between magnetic and non  magnetic cvs .",
    "baraffe et al .  ( 1998 , and references therein ) give a brief account of the input physics used in the most recent low  mass star models we apply here .",
    "the main strengths of these models are in two areas : the microphysics determining the equation of state ( eos ) in the stellar interior , and the outer boundary condition based on non - grey atmosphere models .",
    "the models employ the saumon , chabrier and van horn ( 1995 ) eos which is specifically calculated for vlm stars , bds and giant planets .",
    "the eos is an important ingredient for our analysis , since it determines the mechanical structure of the donor stars , and thus their _ mass  radius relation_. models based on this eos have been successfully tested against stars in detached eclipsing binary systems ( chabrier & baraffe 1995 ) and field m - dwarfs ( cf .",
    "beuermann et al .  1998 ) .",
    "the saumon et al .",
    "( 1995 ) eos has been successfully compared with recent laser - driven shock wave experiments performed at livermore .",
    "these probe the complex regime of pressure dissociation and ionization which is so characteristic for the objects we are studying here ( cf .  saumon et al .  1998 ) .    the second important ingredient of our vlm star and bd models concerns the outer boundary condition , which determines the thermal properties of an object and thus the _ mass  effective temperature (  @xmath22 ) relation_. as demonstrated by chabrier & baraffe ( 1997 ) , evolutionary models with a grey atmosphere outer boundary , e.g.  the standard eddington approximation , overestimate @xmath22 for a given mass , and yield too large a minimum hydrogen burning mass ( mhbm ) . because of tremendous recent progress in the field of cool atmosphere models ( see e.g.  the review of allard et al .",
    "1997 ) these now provide realistic atmosphere profiles and synthetic spectra which we use as a more realistic outer boundary condition .",
    "several observational tests confirm the success of evolutionary models based on these improvements , e.g.  mass  magnitude relationships , colour  magnitude diagrams ( baraffe et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ) , mass  spectral type relationships ( baraffe & chabrier 1996 ) , and the first cool bd gl  229b ( allard et al .",
    "although some discrepancies between models and observations remain ( see baraffe et al .",
    "1998 ) , uncertainties attributed to the input physics now seem significantly reduced .",
    "we employ these one  dimensional bcah models in the context of cvs within the usual roche approximation .",
    "the mass transfer rate is calculated as a function of the difference between donor radius and roche radius , following ritter ( 1988 ) . in a separate set of calculations we apply tidal and rotational corrections to the one  dimension stellar structure equations ( chan & chau 1979 ) to account for the non  spherical shape of roche equipotential surfaces .",
    "this allows us to test the results by nelson et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , who found that their distorted stellar models give a value for @xmath11 which is about @xmath23 longer than for their spherical stellar models .",
    "using the bcah stellar evolution code we recalculated the secular evolution of short  period cvs for various initial component masses .",
    "we assume that orbital angular momentum is lost by gravitational wave emission ( e.g.  landau & lifshitz 1958 ) and via an isotropic stellar wind from the wd .",
    "the wind removes the accreted mass with the wd s specific orbital angular momentum from the binary .",
    "hence the wd mass is constant throughout the evolution .",
    "as we focus on the period minimum we do not consider the evolution at periods longer than 2 - 3  hr . in a second paper ( baraffe & kolb 1999 ;",
    "see also kolb & baraffe 1999 ) we discuss properties of such sequences with more massive donors .",
    "they depend on the rather uncertain strength of the magnetic braking thought to dominate the evolution of cvs above the period gap ( see e.g.  king 1988 for a review ) .",
    "we calculated three sets of evolutionary sequences . in set a",
    "the wd mass is 0.6  @xmath21 , while the initial donor masses range from 0.27  @xmath21 to 0.04  @xmath21 ( see fig .",

    "all donors are hydrogen  rich and have solar metallicity ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the sequences were terminated when the donor s effective temperature @xmath29 was smaller than 900  k. this is the lower limit of the temperature range covered by the present non - grey atmosphere models ( hauschildt et al .",

    "note that a grey outer boundary condition like the standard eddington approximation yields a smaller radius for given donor mass @xmath39 , and a higher mhbm .",
    "a test calculation with fixed mass loss rate and the eddington approximation gives @xmath11 shorter by 5 min than for the corresponding sequence based on non - grey atmosphere models .",

    "is produced by both the secondary and the accretion disc , the estimate of the secondary s contribution may be rather uncertain because of the lack of reliable accretion disc models .",
    "we thus do not regard the discrepancy between model calculations and observational data points ( cf .",

    "we do not think that the discrepancy between nelson et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and our work results from differences in the eos and opacities .",
    "indeed , although our input physics differs from those adopted by chan & chau ( 1979 ) , we find the same quantitative differences quoted by these authors between the properties ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath22 ) of spherical and rotating _ zams stars _",

    "for the same case we find @xmath56 , @xmath57  k.    we thus are confident in our results and conclude that rotational and tidal corrections as described by chan and chau ( 1979 ) can be neglected for cvs , even when the systems are close to period bounce . note that , although the secondary spins up in evolving toward @xmath11 , the key quantity defined by chan and chau ( 1979 ) , @xmath58 which appears in the momentum equation and represents the ratio of rotational to gravitational potential gradient , remains essentially constant at the donor star surface during the evolution ( recall that the angular velocity @xmath59 ) .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath60 , reached at the surface , never exceeds 0.07 .",

    "[ figp1 ] , [ figmontec ] we show period distributions for two different cv subpopulations  p1 and p2  which allow one to study the main effects that determine the structure of the histogram at @xmath2 .",

    "the same analysis has been performed for sequences of set b , with very similar results , which we therefore do not show .    as noted above we",
    "do not consider the evolution of cvs with donors @xmath67 , i.e.  of cvs that form above the period gap . in the disrupted magnetic braking model for the period gap ( e.g.king 1988 ) these systems would all reappear @xmath68  yr after formation at the lower edge of the gap , with a donor in thermal equilibrium .",
    "a bcah stellar model in thermal equilibrium with mass @xmath69 would fill its roche lobe at @xmath70  hr , the observed lower edge of the period gap .",
    "hence we simulate the contribution of systems that form above the gap to the period distribution below the gap by increasing the formation rate in a narrow bin in @xmath71space at 0.21 @xmath21 by a large factor .",

    "simulations by politano ( 1998 , priv .  comm . ) show that the formation of bd cvs is possible when the same formalism is applied as for more massive donor stars . for our purposes",
    "we just extrapolate the birthrate function @xmath73 down to the smallest initial donor mass ( @xmath74 ) considered here .",

    "the simulated period histograms show an accumulation of systems near @xmath2 , the period spike . the only way to remove the period spike effectively from the distribution is to impose a very steep dependence of the system s detectability @xmath94 on one of the evolutionary parameters , e.g.  @xmath95 or steeper .",

    "alternatively , king ( 1999 ) argues that systems approaching the period minimum become magnetic ejectors even if the wd s magnetic field is weak . in this case",
    "an accretion disc can no longer form , and the systems become unobservable .",
    "wz sge , where the wd is suspected to be weakly magnetic ( see e.g.  lasota et al .  1999 , and references therein ) , would be a marginal disc accretor ( wynn & leach 1999 ) .",
    "although this can explain the absence of a period spike at @xmath2 for dwarf novae , it certainly does not apply to the discless polars .",
    "an independent observational selection effect operating on polars in the same period / mass transfer rate range and with the same net result as a steep increase of @xmath97 for dwarf novae seems a highly unlikely coincidence ( but see meyer & meyer ",

    ": polars should show a period spike , even though dwarf novae do not .",
    "could small  number statistics hide the period spike for polars ? to investigate this we performed a number of monte carlo experiments , where we drew a sample of either 33 or 78 systems from an underlying period distribution like the one shown in fig .",

    "specifically , the period axis @xmath109 of the theoretical distribution is rescaled according to c ( c - o_l ) + o_l , [ eq : rescale ] where @xmath110 , @xmath111 denote the calculated period minimum and lower edge of the gap , and @xmath112 , @xmath113 the corresponding observed values .",
    "we applied ( [ eq : rescale ] ) to the model distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ figmontec ] ( @xmath114  min , @xmath115  min ) , assuming the observed values @xmath116  min , @xmath117  min .",
    "the maximum significance level for rejecting the null hypothesis that the observed sample is drawn from this rescaled model distribution is 0.34 for polars , 0.98 for dwarf novae .",
    "if we use @xmath118  min for the observed lower egde of the gap , the rejection significance for polars rises to 0.91 .",
    "this is solely due to the so  called `` 114  min spike '' , see e.g.  ritter & kolb 1992 , still a significant feature in the observed distribution .      neither the small number statistics for polars nor the suggested detectability function for dwarf nova can make the minimum period of the observed distribution significantly longer than in the underlying intrinsic distribution . to achieve this by the latter effect",
    ", dwarf novae have to become unobservable long _ before _ they reach @xmath11 . with @xmath43 as the most likely control parameter determining the detectability this is difficult to achieve , as @xmath43 is almost constant on the non  degenerate branch above @xmath11 .",
    "( this problem would be less severe if the main control parameter were the donor mass , the mass ratio , or the orbital separation .",
    "a particularly steep dependence of the discovery probability on any of these could be achieved if mass transfer cycles , similar to the ones discussed by king et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 , existed in cvs below the period gap , but changed their character discontinuously before @xmath11 . )    to test the effect of small number statistics we drew 1000 samples of either 33 or 78 systems from the theoretical distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ figmontec ] and registered the shortest period @xmath119 of each sample .",
    "the parent distribution has a short  period cut ",
    "off at @xmath120  min .",
    "we found that @xmath121 of the larger samples have @xmath122  min ( @xmath123 have @xmath124  min , @xmath125 have @xmath126  min ) .",
    "the median is @xmath127  min , the longest @xmath119 we found is @xmath128  min .",
    "similarly , @xmath121 of the smaller samples have @xmath129  min ( @xmath123 have @xmath130  min , @xmath125 have @xmath131  min ) , with a median @xmath132  min , and @xmath133  min as the longest @xmath119 .",
    "the rare cases where @xmath119 was as long as 70  min still fall well short of the observed value @xmath134  min .    given this",
    ", it might be that the @xmath2 mismatch is caused by evolutionary effects after all  effects not accounted for in our models .",
    "the chemical composition of the secondary affects the value of @xmath11 , by changing the parameter of the donor at a given mass , hence changing both @xmath135 ( via the angular momentum loss time ) and @xmath136 .",
    "stehle et al .",
    "( 1997 ) pointed out that @xmath11 is slightly shorter for cvs with low  metallicity donors .",
    "they found @xmath137  hr .",
    "our calculations confirm this ( @xmath138  mins .  for @xmath139 , while @xmath140  mins  for @xmath141 ; both with @xmath142 ) .",
    "although @xmath11 increases for higher metallicity donors the effect is much too small to account for a mismatch of @xmath87  mins .",
    "it has been noted that a larger than expected fraction of cvs above the gap have a nuclear  evolved secondary ( beuermann et al .",
    "1998 , baraffe & kolb 1999 , kolb & baraffe 1999 ) .",
    "when these secondaries become fully convective their helium content is @xmath143 , giving a @xmath11 which is in fact @xmath144  mins .",
    "_ shorter _ than for hydrogen  rich donors .",
    "residual shortcomings in the eos and the atmosphere profiles can not yet be ruled out as the cause for the @xmath2 discrepancy . a quantitative estimate of uncertainties in the mass  radius relation from the treatment of the eos ( see saumon et al .",
    "1995 ) is difficult .",
    "the most profound observational test is against stellar parameters determined for components in ( detached ) eclipsing binaries ; yet to date there are no such systems with @xmath145 .",
    "the region near @xmath11 involves effective temperatures lower than 2600  k ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , below which grains form .",
    "these affect both the atmosphere spectrum and profile .",
    "although the atmosphere models used for this study are grainless , calculations based on preliminary atmosphere models including the formation and absorption of grains ( allard 1999 ; baraffe & chabrier 1999 ) do not yield a longer @xmath11 .",
    "we thus do not expect an improvement of the situation with the forthcoming generation of dusty atmosphere models .",
    "the @xmath2 mismatch could also be due to uncertainties in the calculated value of @xmath11 inherent to the very concept of the roche model .",
    "strictly valid only for point masses , its applicability to extended donors relies on the fact that the stars are usually sufficiently centrally condensed .",
    "this is not necessarily a good approximation for fully convective stars which are essentially polytropes of index @xmath146 .",
    "we note that uryu & eriguchi ( 1999 ) considered stationary configurations of fluids describing a synchronously rotating polytropic star in a binary with a point mass companion . for @xmath146 polytropes they find a roche radius that is typically @xmath147 smaller than estimated from eggleton s ( 1983 ) approximation for a given orbital separation , but at the same time @xmath148 larger than the radius of a non  rotating polytrope with the same mass .",
    "alternatively , an obvious way to increase @xmath2 is to increase the orbital angular momentum loss rate @xmath149 over the value @xmath150 set by gravitational radiation .",
    "we find @xmath151  min ( up from @xmath152  min ) for @xmath153 and @xmath154 , a much smaller increase than quoted by paczyski ( 1981 ) .",
    "patterson ( 1998 ) favoured a modest increase of @xmath149 on grounds of space density considerations and the ratio of systems below and above the period gap .",
    "standard population models typically give a local cv space density of up to @xmath155  pc@xmath156 ( de  kool 1992 , kolb 1993 , politano 1996 ) , with @xmath157 of all cvs below the period gap , @xmath158 of these past period bounce .",
    "patterson argues that the observed space density is at least a factor 20 smaller , and that there is little evidence for the predicted large population of post  period minimum cvs",
    ". a higher transfer rate after period bounce would remove systems from the population as the donor can lose all its mass in the age of the galaxy , thus resolving both problems and the @xmath2 mismatch . however , postulating an as yet unknown @xmath149 mechanism which conspires to produce almost the same value as @xmath150 at the transition from non  degenerate to degenerate stars does not seem very attractive .",
    "rather , it seems more likely that the bulk of short  period systems are indeed unobservable  at least in the optical .",
    "watson ( 1999 ) shows that the presence of a population of cvs with a space density of @xmath155  pc@xmath156 that emits @xmath103 of its accretion luminosity in x ",
    "rays can not be excluded from rosat and asca data .",
    "it should be possible to place tight limits on such a population and its potential contribution to the galactic ridge emission from deep xmm and axaf surveys .    as a final note ,",
    "we point out that the evolutionary effect of an irradiation  induced stellar wind from the donor ( considered semi ",
    "analytically by king & van  teeseling 1998 ) could help to resolve the @xmath2 mismatch and the period spike problem ; detailed investigations are under way ( kolb et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we have investigated the problem that the standard explanation for the cv period minimum as a result of period bounce of systems driven by gravitational radiation predicts a period minimum that is too short , and an accumulation of systems close to @xmath11 , the `` period spike '' , which is not observed .    using up  to  date stellar models by baraffe et al .",

    "we have presented synthesised period histograms for cvs below the period gap which , for the first time , are based on evolutionary calculations obtained with full stellar models , and include cvs which form with brown dwarf donors .",
    "the period spike is always present .",
    "although there are ways to explain why the spike is not observed  small number statistics for polars , undetectability for dwarf novae  we find no satisfactory reason why @xmath2 is longer than @xmath11 for both magnetic and non  magnetic cvs .",
