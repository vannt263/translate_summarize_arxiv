    "the heisenberg spin @xmath3 chain with nearest neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) interactions ( which is equivalent to a zig - zag ladder ) is a typical model with frustrations . in the recent years",
    ", several interesting quasi - one - dimensional magnetic systems have been studied experimentally @xcite . among them , some compounds containing @xmath4 chains with edge - sharing @xmath5 plaquette were expected to be described by the @xmath1 model with next - nearest neighbor interactions . the nearest - neighbor @xmath6 spin interaction changes from antiferromagnetic ( afm ) to ferromagnetic ( fm ) , as the angle @xmath7 of the @xmath8 bound approaches @xmath9 .",
    "the next - nearest - neighbor interaction is always afm and is not dependent on @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "several compounds with edge- sharing chains are known , such as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , which can be considered as an ideal model compounds with the ferromagnetic nn interactions and antiferromagnetic nnn interactions @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of such model on a periodic chain of @xmath14 sites is [ eq1 ] h= \\{_i=1^n(_i^x_i+1^x+ _",

    "the ground state properties are well known from the bethe ansatz @xcite . for positive coupling constants ( @xmath20 ) , this model has been investigated previously @xcite . in particular , it has been shown that a transition from a gapless state to a dimerized one takes place at @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the point @xmath22 corresponds to the well known majumdar - ghosh model where the exact ground state is constructed from the direct products of dimers which leads to a gapful phase @xcite .",
    "relatively , less is known about the model with the ferromagnetic nn and the antiferromagnetic nnn interactins .",
    "though the latter model has been a subject of many studies @xcite , the complete picture of the phases in this model is still in investigation @xcite .",
    "it is well known that there is a critical point @xmath23 where the ferromagnetic state is unstable and the ground state is nontrivial at @xmath24 which can be realized by different phases @xcite .",
    "moreover , the exact ground state can be represented in the resonating valence bound state ( rvb ) @xcite .",
    "this state has been proposed as a candidate for the spin liquid ground state @xcite .",
    "one of the most important and open question is the possibility of the spontaneous dimerization of the system in the singlet phase accompanying by a gap in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "the controversial conclusion exists about the presence of a gap at @xmath24 .",
    "it has long been believed that the model is gapless @xcite but one loop renormalization group analysis shows @xcite that the gap opens due to a lorentz symmetry breaking perturbation .",
    "however , the gap has not been checked numerically @xcite .",
    "on the base of field theory consideration it was proposed @xcite that a very tiny but finite gap exists which can not be observed numerically .    in this paper we have considered the one dimensional anisotropic @xmath0 heisenberg model with ferromagnetic nn and antiferromagnetic nnn interactions by implementing the quantum renormalization group ( qrg ) method .",
    "we have calculated the effective hamiltonian up to the second order corrections .",
    "the second order correction is necessary to get a self similar hamiltonian after each step of qrg . in this approach ,",
    "we have considered the effect of whole states of the block hamiltonian which are partially ignored in the first order approach .",

    "we have previously studied the antiferromagnetic model ( eq.([eq1 ] ) ) for @xmath25 by qrg @xcite . for @xmath26",
    "the interplay of the two competing terms ( nn and nnn ) in the presence of quantum fluctuations produces the dimer phase for @xmath27 .",
    "the dimer or spin peierls phase has a spin gap and a broken translation symmetry ( the unit cell is doubled ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , we have determined the fluid - dimer phase transition by using the running of couplings under rg ( see fig.3 of ref.@xcite or the complete phase diagram presented in fig.[fig3 ] in this article ) . in the spin - fluid phase ,",
    "the anisotropy and next - nearest neighbor couplings are irrelevant while in the dimer phase they run to the triple point ( @xmath28 ) . from a quantitative point of view at @xmath29",
    "the rg analysis gives @xmath30 which can be compared with the numerical result of @xmath31 presented in ref.@xcite .",

    "moreover , we intend to consider the @xmath1 model with ferromagnetic nn ( @xmath37 ) and antiferromagnetic nnn ( @xmath38 ) interactions which can be fulfilled by extending the phase diagram to @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "s method , the lattice is divided into blocks where the hamiltonian is exactly diagonalized . by selecting a number of low - lying eigenstates of the blocks",
    "the full hamiltonian is projected into these eigenstates which gives the effective ( renormalized ) hamiltonian .",

    "h^eff_0=p_0h^bp_0  ,  h_1^eff = p_0h^bbp_0  ,  h_2^eff = p_0[h^bb(1-p_0)(1-p_0)h^bb]p_0 .",
    "we have applied the mentioned scheme to the hamiltonian defined in eq.([eq2 ] ) . we have considered three - site block procedure defined in fig.([fig1 ] ) .",

    "@xmath43 is the projection operator to the ground state subspace which defines the rg procedure . due to",
    "the level crossing which occurs for the eigenstates of the block hamiltonian , the projection operator ( @xmath43 ) can be different depending on the coupling constants .",
    "therefore , we must specify the regions with the corresponding ground states .",
    "the eigenvalues of the block hamiltonian are labeled by @xmath44 ( see appendix a ) . in the following , we will classify the regions where each of this states represent the ground state .",
    "a summary of this information is given in fig.([fig4 ] ) of appendix a.      in this region the effective hamiltonian in the first order correction leads to the @xmath1 chain without the nnn interaction ( @xmath46 ) , i.e the effective hamiltonian is not exactly similar to the initial one .",
    "the nnn interaction is the result of the second order correction . when the second order correction is added to the effective hamiltonian ,",
    "the renormalized hamiltonian , apart from an additive constant , is similar to eq.([eq2 ] ) with the renormalized couplings .",
    "thus , the effective hamiltonian including the second order correction for @xmath25 is :    h^eff=.    the renormalized coupling constants are functions of the original ones which are given in appendix b.      the second order effective hamiltonian is similar to the case of region a with different coupling constants given in appendix c. a note is in order here , although the second order correction is necessary to produce the nnn interaction in the effective hamiltonian the initial values of @xmath34 and @xmath33 do not produce nnn interactions .",
    "it is different from the rg flow obtained in region a.      in this region the effective hamiltonian to the second order corrections leads to the ising model h^eff=. where &=&j(+2_2 ) + & + & + & + & j^2 .",
    "this simply introduces the ferromagnetic behavior . we will discuss the phase diagram in terms of different regions defined above in the following section",

    "the solid line is the boundary between dimer ( ii ) phase and spin - fluid ( i ) phase .",
    "if we start from the spin -fluid ( i ) phase or dimer ( ii ) phase , the sign of nn anisotropy ( @xmath17 ) changes under rg after few steps .",
    "however , in the dimer ( ii ) phase the amount of nnn coupling ( @xmath53 ) is greater than 0.44 just when the anisotropy changes sign , while in the spin - fluid ( i ) phase it is less than 0.44 . in other words , in dimer ( ii ) phase the rg flow goes to the triple point ( @xmath28 ) ( the filled circle in fig.([fig3 ] ) ) while it goes to @xmath54 fixed point starting from the spin - fluid ( i ) phase . in fig.([fig2](a ) ) and fig.([fig2](b ) ) the black arrows show the running of couplings under rg . in the region denoted by @xmath55 , though @xmath45 is the ground state , the behavior of the couplings constant is not the same as the couplings in the dimer ( ii ) phase . in this region ( @xmath55 )",
    "coupling constants go to the spin - fluid ( iii ) phase .",
    "it means that the region denoted by @xmath55 and spin - fluid ( iii ) are a unique phase .",
    "the authors in the reference @xcite were not able to specify the phase of this region numerically .",
    "we denote the boundary between the spin - fluid ( iii ) and both dimer ( ii ) and spin - fluid ( i ) phases by long - dashed line .",
    "the dashed line behind the arrows is not a phase boundary and just represents the two regions with differenet ground states ( see appendix a ) .",
    "it is known that on the @xmath49 plane and @xmath56 there is a fixed point , namely : @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "however , our approach is not able to show this fixed point because this is on the plane which is separated by spin - fluid ( i ) and ferromagnetic phases where the level crossing occurs . instead , close to the @xmath56 line we found the critical value of @xmath58 which distinguishes the spin - fluid ( i ) and spin - fluid ( iii ) phases .      in this region",
    "the nnn interactions are greater than nn interactions .",
    "the implementation of bosonization technique combined with a meanfield analysis in the reference @xcite predicted that for @xmath49 plane and @xmath29 , the system might exhibit a chiral ordered phase with gapless excitations where @xmath59 .",
    "the predicted critical value ( @xmath60 ) is in well agreement with the numerical density matrix renormalization group result @xcite .",
    "our approach shows that all coupling constants are irrelevant except @xmath53 and @xmath61 .",
    "for @xmath62 the ratio of @xmath61 to @xmath53 goes to zero and for @xmath63 this ratio goes to infinity .",
    "it means that in the fixed point of this region the original spin chain decouples to two @xmath1 chains without next - nearest - neighbor interactions where the lattice spacing is doubled . for @xmath62 ,",
    "the model is in the spin - fluid ( iii ) phase which is specified in fig.([fig2 ] ) .",
    "the spin - fluid ( iii ) is different from the spin - fluid ( i ) phase according to their stable fixed points .",
    "the stable fixed point for spin - fluid ( i ) is @xmath64 while for spin - fluid ( iii ) it is @xmath65 having @xmath66 .",

    "as we pointed out in sec.[sec2]-c , even after adding the second order corrections , the original hamiltonian is mapped to the ferromagnetic ising model .",
    "ising model remains unchanged under rg as fixed point and its properties are well known .",

    "by contrast , for larger value of @xmath73 the system is in the dimer phase with a finite energy gap above the doubly degenerate ground states ( the transition is denoted by solid line ) . as @xmath53 increases",

    "the qrg equations for @xmath77 shows a critical line ( long dashed line ) which separates the spin - fluid ( i ) and spin - fluid ( iii ) phases without an intermediate region .",
    "thus , we claim that for @xmath78 there is no gap and the model is not in the dimer phase .",
    "the model is in ferromagnetic phase where @xmath63 and small @xmath79 .",

    "the dimer phase is unstable by increasing @xmath53 further which leads to a transition to the antiferromagnetic ( af(iii ) ) phase ( long dashed line ) .",
    "however , the comparison of fig.[fig3](a ) with fig.[fig3](b ) shows that the anisotropy of the nnn - term ( @xmath61 ) changes the phase diagram significantly . from the parameters estimated for several compounds near the isotropic limit ( @xmath81 ) , @xmath11 ( @xmath82 ) , @xmath10 ( @xmath83 ) , @xmath12 ( @xmath84 ) @xcite ,",
