    " spin-1/2 \" particles that are conventionally referred as fermi system , the coordinate bethe ansatz has not been applied to 2-component bose system till recently  @xcite , which is motivated by spinor bose - einstein condensate in magnetically trapped @xmath1rb",

    "recent observation of the superfluid to mott insulator transition in ultracold atoms in optical lattice  @xcite stimulated research interests related to strongly correlated atomic gases .",
    "most recently , the physics of ultracold bose - fermi mixtures  @xcite such as @xmath2li -@xmath3li or @xmath1rb -@xmath4k mixtures become a remarkable topics  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to investigate the features of bose - fermi system on the basis of exact solutions .",
    "the mixed system of bosons and fermions with @xmath0-function interaction was discussed earlier in ref.@xcite where the ground state energy and gapless fermionic excitations are calculated in the thermodynamic limit . however , as we aware , the ground state phase diagram under the influence of external field and chemical potential has not been studied yet .",
    "these properties become more and more important nowadays due to the rapid progress in the field of cold atomic physics .    in this paper",
    "we study one dimensional cold atomic system of bose - fermi mixture systematically .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the following section we introduce the model and derive its secular equation . in section iii ,",
    "we diagonalize the secular equation by means of qism method for three cases respectively .",
    "consequently , three different kinds of nested bethe - ansatz equations are obtained . in section iv",
    ", we explicitly analyze the ground state and the possible low - lying excitations . the energy - momentum spectrum for each excitation",
    "is calculated numerically from the bethe - ansatz equation . in the last section ,",
    "we study the system under the influence of magnetic fields and chemical potentials for the particles to obtain the phase diagram .",
    "we consider a mixture of cold bose gas and fermi gas in one dimension .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is described by gross - pitaevskii functional , @xmath5 where the natural unit is adopted for simplicity , @xmath6 denotes the interaction strength and @xmath7 refer to the three components of @xmath8 fields .",
    "this is an isotropic case of the model considered by cazallia et al.@xcite where approximation method was employed .",
    "we just consider this case because the anisotropic case is unintegrable . among these three fields ,",
    "two obey anti - commutation relation and one obeys commutation relation .",
    "it is convenient to consider the states that span a hilbert space of @xmath9 particles @xmath10 the eigenvalue problem @xmath11 becomes an @xmath9-particle quantum mechanical problem with the first quantized hamiltonian , @xmath12 such a system can be solved by means of bethe - ansatz approach . hereby we give a brief description of the main idea of this approach . in the domain @xmath13",
    ", the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) reduces to that for free particles and its eigenfunctions are therefore just superpositions of plane waves .",
    "when two particles collide , a scattering process occurs , which is supposed to be a pure elastic process , i.e. exchange of their momenta .",
    "so for a given momentum @xmath14 , the scattering momenta include all permutations of the components of @xmath15 .",
    "because the hamiltonian is invariant under the action of the permutation group @xmath16 , one can adopt the following bethe - ansatz wavefunction @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 denotes the @xmath8 component of the @xmath20th particles ; @xmath21 denotes the image of a given @xmath22 by a mapping @xmath23 ; @xmath24 . and the coefficients @xmath25 are functions of @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath27 denotes the permutation such that @xmath28 . for the bose - fermi mixture , the wave function should be either symmetric or antisymmetric under permutation @xmath29 depending on whether they involve bose label or fermi labels .",
    "@xmath30 the @xmath0-function term in the hamiltonian contributes a boundary condition across the hyper - plane @xmath31 . substituting the beth - ansatz wave function into this boundary condition and using the continuity condition together with the permutation symmetry , we obtain the following relation @xmath32p^j   + c } \\over { i[(pk)_j   - ( pk)_{j + 1 } ] p^j   - c}}a_a ( p , q)\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the permutation between particles at @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which is given in appendix for concrete choice of the bose - fermi labels . for example , if we consider the wave functions of two particles , because of the different exchange symmetries , the wave function of two bosons is @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for two fermions .",
    "the permutation for two bosons is @xmath38 , and @xmath39 for two fermions .",

    "thus the periodic boundary condition imposes a relation between the wave functions defined on @xmath46 and @xmath48 . writing out this relation in terms of eq.([eq : bawavefunction ] ) , we find that the periodic boundary conditions are guaranteed provided that @xmath50 . after applying the @xmath51 matrix successively ,",
    "we obtain the following secular equation , @xmath52",
    "to determine the spectrum , we should diagonalize the secular equation ( [ eq : secular ] ) .",
    "this can be done by diagonalizing the operator product in the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : secular ] ) , namely , solving the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath53 where @xmath54 since they satisfy the yang - baxter relation : @xmath55 the diagonalization can be carried out by means qism . for eq .",

    "since the bose - fermi mixture is @xmath8 supersymetric system , the application of qism becomes complicated . in the su(3 ) case a unique nested bethe - ansatz equation was derived  @xcite . in present case",
    ", however , there are three possibilities in choosing the reference state (  pseudo - vacuum \" ) and the successive orders of the other states , and hence three types of nested bethe - ansatz equations have to be derived . in the following",

    "then in the strong - coupling limit @xmath232 , @xmath233 and eqs.([sub ] ) give rise to @xmath234 furthermore , the new form will be @xmath235 = 2\\pi    \\\\\\ ] ] from the formula above , we know if @xmath121 approaches to @xmath9 , @xmath236 is the smallest , so does the energy .",
    "therefore , the @xmath237 state is the ground state .",
    "we describe the density of ground state by numerical approaches , and find that is the same as fig.[figure graph1](left ) .",
    "if we permit @xmath238 , i.e. there are three spin up fermions lying in the ground state , the density of state is also shown in fig.[figure graph1](right ) .",
    "it is obvious that the more the fermions lying in this system , the higher the energy will be .",
    "thus the ground state is exactly all bosons without one fermion , which verifies the analysis in case 1 .",
    "furthermore we remove one of the @xmath239s from the ground state sequence and add a  new \" @xmath240 outside .",
    "excited states are obtained by varying the quantum number as @xmath241 @xmath242 consequently we get the excitation spectrum which is nt different from fig.[figure graph4 ] .    for this case the excitation of adding one fermion is obtained from @xmath243 , which contains one free parameter in the @xmath63-sequence and one free parameter in the @xmath244-sequence .",
    "thus the order of quantum numbers is : @xmath245 where @xmath246 .",
    "the excitation spectrum is shown in fig.[figure graph5](a ) , which is also consistent with the excitation of adding one fermion in case @xmath205 .    comparing to the case 1 , when we add two spin up fermions ( @xmath247 ) , there are two free parameters in the @xmath244-sequence .",

    "if there is a @xmath149 satisfying @xmath253 , we will get @xmath254 , otherwise @xmath255 . from those above",
    ", we find that adding a @xmath149 into the @xmath133 space will expand the distance of neighboring particles and lead to decrease of the energy .",
    "thus the more @xmath149 lying between @xmath133 and @xmath224 , the lower the energy will be .",
    "letting @xmath256 , there will be @xmath257 solutions of @xmath258 and @xmath221 satisfying @xmath259 , @xmath260 , where @xmath261 is the integer which equals or surpasses one , i.e. @xmath262 . then there will be two fermions or two bosons or one fermion and one boson between @xmath134 and @xmath231 .",
    "as we always set the distance between the neighboring quantum numbers as one , the most reasonable state should be one fermion and one boson between @xmath134 and @xmath231 .",

    "this result concides with parts of lai s  @xcite results .",
    "the density of the ground state is the same as fig.[figure graph1](left ) . when @xmath264 , i.e. there is one spin - up fermion in the ground state , we have the same result as fig.[figure graph1](middle ) . and",
    "the more spin up fermions there are , the higher the energy should be .",
    "the particle - hole excitation spectrum is as fig.[figure graph4 ] . due to the restriction given by the young tableau",
    ", @xmath247 gives the excitation of adding one spin - up and one spin - down fermion , and exactly there are three holes in the @xmath244-sequence .",
    "this excitation is depicted in fig.[figure graph5](b ) .",
    "it also sustains the analysis of the case @xmath205 .      in our analytic and numerical results ,",
    "the density of ground state ( fig.[figure graph1](left ) ) and the energy - momentum spectrum of low - lying excitations ( fig.[figure graph5](a ) , fig.[figure graph5](b ) ) in the three cases are the same , and the ground states for all the three cases are the states with merely bosons .",
    "i.e. in the bff case , the ground state is @xmath265 , @xmath266 for the fbf case and @xmath267 for the ffb case , they are all merely boson state .",
    "thus we conclude that the properties of this multi - component system in one dimension are independent of the reference state which we choose , which manifests the consistency of these cases . such kind of equivalence was noticed in the so called super - symmetry t - j model  @xcite .",
    "we take into account both the chemical potentials and the external magnetic fields which bring about the zeeman splitting for fermions . at first , we analyze two limit cases : the case of free particles and the case of particles with infinitely strong interaction . we have got the phase diagram as fig.[figure graph7 ] and fig.[figure graph8 ] .",
    "when @xmath268 , we can treat these particles as free particles .",
    "thus in the ground state , only fermions have non - zero momentum because of the pauli excluding principle .",
    "we plot the phase diagram in fig.[figure graph7 ] for 42 particles .",
    "the region  s \" is composed by some rhombuses that stands for different number of fermi pairs@xmath269 .",
    "we take two rhombuses ( 3 and 5 pairs of fermions ) for example . in the valley region between them",
    "( here we consider h@xmath2700 ) , there are 5 spin up and 3 spin down fermions . thus on the left boundary of this valley , the energy of 3 pairs of spin singlet fermions equals that of 5 spin up plus 3 spin down fermions .",
    "because there are @xmath122 bosons , @xmath124 spin - up fermions , and @xmath123 spin - down fermions , @xmath271 analogously , @xmath272 thus the phase boundary can be described as @xmath273 , which reduces to : @xmath274 similarly , the equation of the right boundary is : @xmath275 in which @xmath276 .",
    "when the intensity of interaction approaches to infinity , any two particles can not stay in the same state .",
    "thus there should be a much stronger excluding force than pauli principle .    because the energy of @xmath9 particles(@xmath122 bosons , @xmath124 spin up fermions , @xmath123 spin down fermions )",
    "is : @xmath277 when the direction of the magnetic field is along the spin up(@xmath278 ) direction , the spin down fermions can not appear in the ground state .",
    "therefore , in region  bf1 \" , there are only fermions with spin up and bosons ; and in region  f1 \" , there are n fermions with spin up .",
    "the same analysis hold when @xmath279 .",
    "we solve this model within the rules of the young tableau ( n - m@xmath280 m-@xmath281 @xmath280 @xmath282 ) by using eqs.([eq : baebff ] ) , thus the case of all the particles being fermions in ground state can not be gained here .",
    "and we only computed the case of @xmath278 because of symmetry .",
    "as shown in fig.[figure graph9 ] , the phase boundary between  b \" and  bf1 \" is the same as that in the two limit cases above , which intersects with the h - axis at @xmath283 .",
    "the boundary between  bf1 \" and  bf1f2 \" can be divided into two parts from @xmath284 .",
    "the left part has some fluctuations which means adding a pair of spin up fermions in  bf1f2 \" side .",
    "the highest point ( @xmath284 ) stands for 19 spin up and 1 spin down fermions .",
    "according the young tableau , it can not add spin up fermion pair on the  19 up 1 down \" state any more .",
    "thus when @xmath285 , we can only add the spin down fermi pair .",
    "this is the reason why there is a inflexion at @xmath284 .",
    "we figure out an outline of the spin singlet phase  f \" , in which we can also see that there are some small fluctuations which stand for adding a pair of spin singlet fermions .",
    "it somewhat likes the free particles case . because of pauli excluding principle",
    ", only two fermions with different spins can stay in the same state .",
    "hence in the spin singlet phase , the pair numbers are @xmath286 along the horizontal axis . from @xmath287 on , the pair number equals 14 , which is the largest pair number we can get here .",
