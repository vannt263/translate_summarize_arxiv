    "giant radio sources ( grss ) , defined to be over @xmath01 mpc in size ( h@xmath1=71 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , @xmath3=0.27 , @xmath4=0.73 ) , could provide valuable insights towards understanding the late stages of evolution of radio sources . in the course of our study of grss ( ishwara - chandra & saikia 1999 ; konar et al . 2004 , 2008 ; jamrozy et al .",
    "2008 ) , a number of these objects appeared to have diffuse lobes of emission without any prominent peaks of emission towards the outer edges of the lobes . unlike fanaroff - riley class",
    "i sources , these do not have any jets and the radio emission could be from relic lobes .",
    "we have chosen three of these sources , namely j0139 + 3957 ( 4c39.04 ) , j0200 + 4049 ( 4c40.08 ) and j0807 + 7400 , for a detailed investigation .",
    "further details are in godambe et al .",
    "* j0139 + 3957 : * the large - scale structure shows the relaxed lobes ( figure 1 ; klein et al .",
    "this source is at a redshift of 0.2107 and has an overall size of 1259 kpc .",
    "konar et al .",
    "( 2004 ) reported gmrt and vla observations at 1287 and 4841 mhz respectively .",
    "the integrated spectrum of the source after subtracting the core flux density yields an injection spectral index , @xmath5@xmath01.00 for the jaffe - perola model using the synage package ( murgia et al .",
    "1999 ) . here , the spectral index , @xmath6 is defined as s@xmath7 .",
    "the fits to the western and eastern lobes adopting an injection spectral index of 1.0 , gave spectral ages @xmath012@xmath8 and 5.3@xmath9 myr respectively using the classical estimates of magnetic field ( konar et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "* j0200 + 4049 : * this radio galaxy is located at a redshift of 0.0827 and its largest linear size is 1414 kpc .",
    "our gmrt image at 333 mhz ( figure 2 ) shows the diffuse lobes of emission with evidence of a depression in the centre of the western lobe .",
    "this clearly suggests that the lobes are no longer being fed with energy from the nucleus .",
    "it is also seen at 239 mhz where the data is of poorer quality , and at 605 mhz which require more short - spacing data to produce a better image .",
    "the flux density of the source appears to have been under - estimated in the 74-mhz vlss image and at 178 mhz in the 4c survey , possibly due to the large extent of the diffuse low - brightness lobes of emission .",
    "the values at these frequencies lie significantly below the fit to the integrated spectrum .",
    "the injection spectral index has been estimated to be 0.73 without including measurements which have missed a large fraction of the flux density ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the spectral ages estimated for the western and eastern lobes are @xmath0143@xmath10 and 151@xmath10 myr respectively , which is the largest amongst the three sources discussed here .",
    "* j0807 + 7400 : * this source is a giant low - power radio galaxy , the weakest of our three grss .",
    "it is at a redshift of 0.1204 and its largest linear size is 1190 kpc .",
    "observations at 1.4 ghz by lara et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show a compact core component and a weak and extended halo - like emission elongated in the east - west direction with no evidence of either jets or hotspots . at 4.9 ghz ,",
    "only the core component was visible .",
    "lara et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested that this object could be a relic fr ii radio galaxy where hotspot regions are no longer present .",
    "our gmrt images at low frequencies show the diffuse lobes and bridge of emission ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the spectral ages of the lobes , estimated for an injection spectral index of 0.73 are @xmath046@xmath11 and 64@xmath12 myr for the western and eastern lobes respectively .",
    "the core has a flat spectral index at high frequencies but appears to have a steep radio spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath00.6 at lower frequencies , possibly due to unresolved jet / lobe structure from more recent activity .",
    "we have explored the possibility that these sources have relic lobes by examining the structure and spectra of all three sources over a large frequency range .",
    "although these three sources do not have hotspots , their structures are not similar to the fri sources which are characterised by jets that expand to form the diffuse lobes of emission .",
    "also , the luminosities of two of the three ( j0139 + 3957 and j0200 + 4049 ) sources are above the dividing line for these two classes of sources .",
    "the spectral ages are in the range of @xmath05@xmath1310@xmath14 to 1.5@xmath1310@xmath15 yr , the upper value being close to time scales for which the lobes are likely to remain visible if not fed with a fresh supply of energy from the parent galaxy . however , for more reliable estimates we need further measurements at both lower and higher frequencies . the structure and spectra suggest that these lobes are possibly no longer being fed , with one of the lobes in j0200 + 4049 exhibiting a depression in surface brightness towards the centre of the lobe .",
    "the detection of cores suggests that their nuclei are currently active .",
    "these show evidence of steep - spectrum emission",
    ". it would be interesting to determine the structures of the cores from high - resolution radio observations . interpreting the cores as more recent activity , the time scales of episodic activity range from @xmath05@xmath1310@xmath14 to 10@xmath15 yr .    godambe , s. , konar , c. , saikia , d. j. , & wiita , p.j .",
