    "precise models of level density @xmath9 and radiative strength functions @xmath10 of the populated them primary dipole gamma - transitions at the neutron radiative capture are necessary for estimation of experimental neutron cross - sections and their calculation at lack of experimental data .",
    "first of all , it is necessary for actinides .",
    "available @xcite models , most probably , do not satisfy modern requirements to these data @xcite .",
    "their insufficient quality is conditioned by clearly small volume of reliable experimental data on level density and emission probability , for example , of gamma - quanta .",
    "this results from significant errors of experiments performed up to now .",
    "underestimation of uncertainties is largely caused by the use of obsolete notions of a nucleus for analysis of experiment .",
    "an increase of reliability level of the experimental data on @xmath9 and @xmath11 demands one to develop new methods for their determination at obliged minimization of number of any assumptions and hypotheses of mechanism of used nuclear reaction .",
    "this condition is in high extent satisfied in analysis of the two - step gamma - cascade intensities following thermal neutron capture @xcite . by means of this analysis",
    "it was observed for the first time the clearly expressed step - wise structure with a width of @xmath12 mev in the level density @xmath9 below @xmath13 in a large set of nuclei .",
    "further development of this method @xcite brought to an additional determination of unknown fact of strong dependence of partial widths @xmath14 of not only primary but also following gamma - transitions on the energy of the excited levels @xmath15 in the region of the structure mentioned above .",
    "intensities @xmath16 were measured up to now only for the case of thermal neutron capture .",
    "accumulated experimental data allowed one to determine the @xmath9 and @xmath11 values for 42 nuclei @xcite ( in the framework of standard hypothesis @xcite on independence of radiative strength functions on nuclear excitation energy ) . for two tens of them",
    "these data were obtained at relatively realistic accounting for function @xmath17 , experimentally estimated below excitation energy @xmath18 mev @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the observed in @xcite considerable dtviation of relation + @xmath19 indirectly and relatively weekly influences the determined parameters of the cascade gamma - decay .",
    "this conclusion is true for the analysis of the intensities of the two - step gamma - cascades to the final levels with excitation energy @xmath20 mev . in this case , the maximum change in the calculated total radiative width of cascade intermediate level ( with accounting for function @xmath21 derived from experiment ) brings to decrease in the obtained according to @xcite value of @xmath9 in region of step - wise structure by a factor not more than 2 as compared with @xcite .",
    "therefore , method @xcite provides the @xmath9 and @xmath11 values with the least at present systematic errors @xcite .    nevertheless , obviously observed dependence of cascade intensity on the structure of all three levels included initial compound - state @xcite stipulates for necessity to get new experimental data on @xmath9 and @xmath11 from the other experiments devoted to investigation of gamma - decay .",
    "in addition , the methods @xcite belong to class of reverse problems ( determination of unknown parameters of functions measured in experiment ) and , that is why , they require maximum possible verification and revealing all sources of systematic errors . in practice , this condition stipulates for necessity to get additional set of data on @xmath9 and @xmath11 from the maximum number of independent experiments .",
    "it is necessary also to solve the problem of estimating possible dependence of found according to @xcite gamma - decay parameters of high - lying levels on energy of neutron resonances @xmath22 and probable influence of their structures on the process under study",
    ". on the whole , analysis of the tendencies in determining @xmath9 and @xmath11 from solution of reverse tasks points to necessity in further investigations aimed to :    * estimation of adequacy of model notions of gamma - decay process to experiment and * direct accounting for the coexistence and strong interaction between fermi- and bose - systems in the radiative strength function models .",
    "this must be done also in more details and more precisely in the level density models for nuclei of any mass and type .",
    "both solution of the problem of correctness of model notions and necessity to study influence of the structure of the initial compound - states on the cascade gamma - decay process is up to now the primary aim of experiment . at present , this can be done in analysis of experimental intensities of the primary gamma - transitions following capture of  filtered \" neutrons with energy 2 and 24 kev ( or by any averaging over resolved resonances ) .",
    "the most complete set of these data among actinides is accumulated for compound nucleus @xmath5u .",
    "unfortunately , authors of corresponding experiments @xcite used their data practically only for determination of spin and parity of excited levels on the base of notions of the limited  statistics \" theory of gamma - decay .",
    "i.e. , in the framework of the hypotheses :    * on independence of @xmath23 and @xmath24 on structure of decaying ( @xmath22 ) and excited ( @xmath15 ) nuclear levels and * applicability of the porter - thomas distribution @xcite for describing random deviations of the gamma - transition partial widths in any interval of their energy from mean values .",
    "there are no experimental evidences of hypothesis @xcite for the data like @xcite ( concrete nucleus , given set of gamma - transition intensities ) .",
    "therefore , the method of analysis must take into account possibility of non - execution of assumptions mentioned above .",
    "the analysis is based on the following statements :    * the number of the primary dipole transitions observed in the @xmath6 reaction is less than or equal to the value @xmath25 for any excitation energy interval @xmath26 and spin window determined by the selection rule on multipolarity ; * the sum of widths of the observed transitions is less than or equal to the summed width of all the possible primary gamma - transitions ; * the likelihood function of approximation of distribution of random intensity deviations from the mean value has the only maximum ; * the experimental values of @xmath27 and sum @xmath28 can be determined with acceptable uncertainty from extrapolation by curve which approximates distribution of the random gamma - transition intensities to zero threshold of their registration ; * the averaging of random fluctuations of the primary gamma - transition widths over the initial compound states decreases dispersion of their distribution independently on reliability of hypothesis @xcite .",
    "i. e. , any set of gamma - transition intensities from the @xmath6 reaction can be approximately described by the @xmath29-distribution with unknown number of degrees of freedom @xmath30 .",
    "( in practice this distribution is close to normal one with dispersion @xmath31 . )",
    "this means that the number of the primary gamma - transitions from reaction @xmath6 with intensity lying below detection threshold of experiment @xcite in any case considerably decreases as compared with analogous data obtained for decay of the only compound - state . in this case ,",
    "determination of the primary gamma - transition intensity distribution parameters provides maximum possible precision for extrapolation of function of intensities random values distribution into the region below the detection threshold .    therefore , precision in estimating the number of unobserved gamma - transitions and sum of their partial widths from the data @xcite must be much higher than it can be reached by analysis of intensities of primary gamma - transitions following thermal neutron capture . corresponding technique was developed earlier and tested on large set of the data on the two - step cascade intensities in @xcite .",
    "the problem of principle importance in the analysis of such kind is really unknown law of distribution of dispersion of random widths about mean value .",
    "the fact of discrepancy between dispersion of random intensities of primary gamma - transitions and expected for a given nucleus value of @xmath30 at the capture of 2 kev neutrons was first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "but up to now attempts to solve this problem were undertaken up to now .",
    "the porter - thomas distribution correctly describes distribution of the random partial widths of the tested gamma - transitions only when their amplitudes have normal distribution with zero mean value .",
    "therefore , they must be the sum of large number of items of different signs and the same order of magnitude .",
    "this condition must be fulfilled if wave - functions of the levels connected by gamma - transition contain a large amount of items with different signs and comparable magnitudes .",
    "just these components are contained in matrix element for amplitude of gamma - transition .      on the whole , existing theoretic developments , for example , quasiparticle - phonon nuclear model ( qpnm ) @xcite call some doubts about applicability of mentioned above primitive ideas of gamma - decay . in particular , the regularities of fragmentation of the different complicated states studied in the frameworks of qpnm @xcite directly point to presence of items with considerable component of wave functions in the primary transition amplitudes .",
    "first of all , this concerns wave functions of excited levels @xcite , but it is not excluded that the wave - functions of decaying compound states ( neutron resonances ) also have large components @xcite .",
    "this directly results in potential possibility of rather considerable violation of the porter - thomas distribution .",
    "these violations can appear themselves in limited @xcite energy intervals of final levels and change dispersion of real distribution as compared with @xcite .",
    "correlation between absolute values of items in amplitude of any gamma - transition and their signs for the data like @xcite are unknown .",
    "therefore , the suggested below analysis of available experimental data must take into account possibility of strong dependence of the primary transition partial widths on structure and , correspondingly , energy of excited levels and cover all spectrum of their random deviations from the mean value .",
    "at least , it must guaranty obtaining the minimum possible estimation for @xmath9 and the maximum possible  for @xmath11 .",
    "just this sign of deviation of their experimental values from the practically used @xcite model ideas is provided by the analysis @xcite .    according to theoretical notions of qpnm ,",
    "the amplitude of gamma - transition from high - excited nuclear state ( neutron resonance ) is a sum of different in structure elements @xcite .",
    "schematically @xcite they consist from a number of items which correspond to the following components of wave - functions of decaying and excited levels connected by the gamma - transition :    \\(a ) n - quasiparticle ,    \\(b ) n - quasiparticle @xmath32 phonon ,    \\(c ) n - quasiparticle @xmath32 two phonons and so on .",
    "i. e. , amplitude of given gamma - transition can be determined by some components of physically different types . in common case",
    "they can have considerably different scale . and",
    "concrete values are determined by degree of fragmentation of the nuclear states enumerated above .",
    "the types of dominant components in the wave - functions of final levels excited by primary gamma - transitions can be different in principle , especially at low excitation energy of levels @xcite .",
    "the first part of amplitude ( see , for example , @xcite ) for many rather high - lying levels is determined by a number of items of different sign and , on the average , comparable magnitude .",
    "this qualitative explanation follows from calculation of structures of low - lying levels of deformed nuclei performed by authors @xcite and the most general principles of fragmentation of nuclear states of complicated structure as increasing excitation energy @xcite",
    ".    the following items in the gamma - transition amplitude ( at sufficient energy of excited level ) account for contribution of those components which cause change in wave functions by one phonon .",
    "i.e. , it follows from main theses of qpnm , for example , that the all multitude of the primary gamma - transition amplitudes can not be reduced to one limited case as it was suggested in @xcite .",
    "experimental investigations of various target - nuclei were performed in bnl . but only even - odd target - nucleus @xmath33u was chosen for the analysis presented below .",
    "this choice is stipulated by maximum interval of the primary gamma - transition energies listed in @xcite .",
    "even - odd compound - nucleus has an only possible spin at capture of s - neutrons and two possible  for p - neutrons .",
    "analysis of intensities in the last case requires one to introduce and then determine the number of parameters corresponding to even - even nucleus .",
    "even - odd compound nucleus at its excitation by s - neutrons represents methodically a particular case of the task considered in @xcite .",
    "the width fwhm=850 ev of filtered neutron beam with the energy of 2 kev in the performed experiments was determined by interference minimum in the total cross section of scandium .",
    "the average spacing between neuron resonances in @xmath33u equals 12 ev and this provides minimum number of the primary gamma - transitions whose intensities are less than detection threshold .",
    "if one does not account for :    \\(a ) the change in neutron flux in the energy interval mentioned above ;    \\(b ) the possible strong correlation of partial radiative widths and    \\(c ) the presence of noticeable statistic errors in experimental data    then dispersion @xmath34 of their expected distribution can be not less than @xmath35 . in presence of absolute correlation between reduced neutron width and partial radiative widths one can estimate maximum possible dispersion from the folding of two @xmath29 dispersions by the value @xmath36 .",
    "i.e , the main part of the primary gamma - transition intensities observed in the nucleus under consideration must exceed experimental detection threshold .",
    "therefore , expected errors of extrapolation must be small enough .",
    "it is assumed in analysis that all the distributions of the primary gamma - transition intensities from reaction @xmath6 have only the following unknown parameters :    \\(a ) the averaged reduced intensity @xmath37 of gamma - transitions populating levels @xmath38 ;    \\(b ) the portion @xmath39 of reduced intensities of gamma - transitions to levels @xmath40 relatively to that to levels @xmath38 ( practically - for intensities of primary transitions following capture of neutrons with energy of 24 kev ;    \\(c ) the ratio @xmath41 which is independent on spin values of the levels populated by the primary transitions ;    \\(d ) the expected and equal numbers @xmath42 of gamma - transitions to levels @xmath38 and @xmath40 ;    \\(e ) as well as the dispersion @xmath43 measured in units of degree of freedom @xmath30 .    naturally , these parameters are to be determined independently for each energy interval of the primary gamma - transitions .",
    "the presence of statistical errors in determination of each experimental value of @xmath44 automatically increases experimental dispersion @xmath43 of distribution and decreases the @xmath30 value .",
    "it is assumed that their relative systematic errors in each energy interval are practically equal .",
    "of course , this notion assumes that the structures of initial compound - state and a group of levels in rather narrow interval @xmath26 of excitation energy connected by the primary gamma - transitions of the same type weekly influence the mean reduced intensities @xmath44 of these quanta .    both performed in @xcite approximation and interpretation of experimental data on @xmath45 and ideas of modern nuclear theories",
    "show that this assumption can contain considerable uncertainty ( especially for wide energy intervals of the primary gamma - transitions under study ) .",
    "but the maximum accuracy in determination of the most probable values of @xmath42 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath30 and @xmath48 can be achieved , in principle , by recurrent optimization of the primary gamma - transition energy intervals where are determined these parameters .",
    "one more problem is due to small volume of the set and difference in numbers of electric and magnetic dipole gamma - transitions in concrete intervals @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to introduce and fix in analysis some assumption about number of levels of positive and negative parity in a given energy interval of nuclear levels .",
    "below is used the hypothesis of equality of number of electric and magnetic gamma - transitions . in practice",
    ", this ratio can be varied for any possible hypotheses of ratio between level densities with different parity for any given excitation energy interval .",
    "the problem of difference in level density of different parity disappears for values of @xmath49 , the maximum error in determination of @xmath42 in case @xmath50 corresponds to the lowest intensity transitions and insignificantly distorts desired sum @xmath51 . in intermediate case ,",
    "error of approximation will be stipulated , first of all , by difference in level densities of positive and negative parity  it will decrease as increasing excitation energy ( as it was on the whole predicted by modern theoretical calculation of this nucleus parameter @xcite ) .",
    "approximation of the mixture of the different type random values with respect to mean parameters by any distribution can not determine their belonging to certain type without using additional information .",
    "but , accounting for the known fact that the magnetic gamma - transitions to the lowest levels are by order of magnitude weaker than electric transitions , one can extrapolate inequality @xmath52 for the nuclei under study up to excitation energy where @xmath53 .",
    "there is not excluded that at higher energies of gamma - quanta @xmath54 .    strength function of p - neurons @xmath55 in isotope @xmath33u noticeably exceeds strength function of s - neutrons @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "authors of @xcite estimated that in this case the portion of captures of p - neutrons with energy of 2 kev equals approximately 15% .",
    "if one does not account for possible irradiation of small group of the primary dipole gamma - transitions following capture of p - neutrons and terminating at the levels with spin values @xmath40 , then the presence of this capture appears itself , most probably , as change in the @xmath47 values for different energies of excited levels and corresponding increase of @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the presence of small number of the 2 kev p - neutron captures must not noticeably influence accuracy in determination of the expected values of @xmath42 and sum @xmath45 .",
    "there is no problem of p - neutron capture for the data on the intensities of primary gamma - transitions for resolved resonances .",
    "absolute normalization of partial widths for each resonance performed in @xcite allows one to provide for the most effective averaging of them .",
    "unfortunately , arithmetic mean value of @xmath14 inevitably shifts to lower values by different for each gamma - transition quantity @xmath57",
    ". partial width @xmath58 of each from @xmath59 gamma - transition with intensity lying below registration threshold in given resonance varies from zero to some maximum magnitude .",
    "that is why , averaging over resonances additionally has this unknown specific error .",
    "approximation of distribution of random values @xmath60 was performed by analogy with @xcite for cumulative sums in function of increasing values of intensities .",

    "the presence of functional dependence of the primary transition intensities on some  hidden \" parameter can result in maximal errors of approximated values of the most probable number of gamma - transitions and dispersion of their deviation from mean value .",
    "modern nuclear theory does not consider this possibility ; there are no experimental data on existence of  hidden \" dependence , as well .",

    "the porter - thomas distribution allows very considerable random deviations of partial widths .",
    "but the measured gamma - transition intensities are always limited by finite value of the total radiative width of decaying state . therefore , the set of the best values of parameters depends on the total width of region for approximation of cumulative sums .",
    "mainly this concerns the best value of parameter @xmath30 . in the performed analysis , intensities were normalized so that their maximum value would not exceed 50 - 70% of the approximation region width .",
    "the main error of analysis can be related only to the  loss \" of gamma - transitions whose intensities exceed threshold value and/or due to mistaken identification of the secondary gamma - transitions as the primary one .",
    "the probability of overlapping of two peaks corresponding to neighbouring levels was estimated in @xcite .",
    "as it follows from the data presented by authors , this effect is rather small and , most probably , can not explain considerable ( several times ) discrepancy between level density determined by us and predictions of the fermi - gas level density model @xcite .",
    "considerable uncertainty could be due to even and significant loss of observed peaks corresponding to intense primary transitions ( exceeding their detection threshold ) owing to their grouping in multiplets with rather narrow ( @xmath77 kev ) spacing between peaks .",

    "apparently , only such hypothesis can be alternative potential explanation of  step - wise \" structure in level density in analysis performed in this work .",
