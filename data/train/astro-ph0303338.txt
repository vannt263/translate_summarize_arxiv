    "the combined data from the measurements of the spectrum of anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite and from the observations of high redshift type ia supernovae @xcite indicate that the matter content of the universe today may be very probably described by cold dark matter and dark energy , in a proportion such that @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "these dark components of the matter content of the universe manifest themselves only through their gravitational effects . at same time , a fraction of the dark components agglomerates at small scales ( cold dark matter ) while the other fraction seems to be a smooth component ( dark energy )",
    ". the dark energy must exhibit negative pressure , since it would be the responsible for the present acceleration of the universe as indicated by the type ia supernovae observations , while the cold matter must have zero ( or almost zero ) pressure , in order that it can gravitationally collapse at small scales .",
    "the nature of these mysterious matter components of the universe is object of many debates .",
    "the cold dark matter may be , for example , axions which result from the symmetry breaking process of grand unified theories in the very early universe .",
    "but , since grand unified theories , and their supersymmetrical versions , remain a theoretical proposal , the nature of cold dark matter is yet an open issue .    a cosmological constant is , in principle , the most natural candidate to describe the dark energy",
    ". it contributes with an homogeneous , constant energy density , its fluctuation being strictly zero .",
    "however , if the origin of the cosmological constant is the vacuum energy , there is a discrepancy of about @xmath15 orders of magnitude between its theoretical value and the observed value of dark energy @xcite .",
    "this situation can be ameliorate , but not solved , if supersymmetry is taken into account .",
    "another candidate to represent dark energy is quintessence , which considers a self - interacting scalar field , which interpolates a radiative era and a vacuum dominated era @xcite .",
    "but the quintessence program suffers from fine tuning of microphysical parameters @xcite .",
    "recently , an alternative to both the cosmological constant and to quintessence to describe dark energy has been proposed : the chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "the chaplygin gas is characterized by the equation of state @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a constant .",
    "hence , the pressure is negative while the sound velocity is positive , avoiding instability problems at small scales @xcite .",
    "the chaplygin gas has been firstly conceived in studies of adiabatic fluids @xcite , but recently it has been identified an interesting connection with string theories @xcite . some extensions of the chaplygin gas have been proposed @xcite through the equation of state @xmath18 however , the connection with string theories is lost unless @xmath19 , and for this reason we will only consider in what follows the equation of state ( [ eoe ] ) .    considering a relativistic fluid with the equation of state ( [ eoe ] ) ,",
    "the equation for the energy - momentum conservation relations leads , in the case of an homogeneous and isotropic universe , to the following relation between the fluid density and the scale factor @xmath20 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an integration constant .",
    "this relation shows that initially the chaplygin gas behaves as a pressureless fluid , acquiring later a behaviour similar to a cosmological constant .",
    "so , it interpolates a decelerated phase of expansion to an accelerated one , in way close to that of the quintessence program .    in this work",
    ", we will constrain the parameters associated with the chaplygin gas model ( @xmath23 ) using the type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) observational data . specifically",
    ", we will consider a model where the dynamics of the universe is driven in principle by pressureless matter and by the chaplygin gas .",
    "the luminosity distance for the configuration where , in general , chaplygin gas and dark matter are present , is evaluated from which the relation between the magnitude and the redshift @xmath24 is established .",
    "the observational data are then considered , and they are fitted using four free parameters : the ratio of the density fraction , with respect to the critical density @xmath25 , of the pressureless matter and of the chaplygin gas , @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , the sound velocity of the chaplygin gas @xmath28 , in terms of the velocity of light , the curvature parameter @xmath29 and the hubble parameter @xmath30 .",
    "all these parameters are evaluated today .",
    "the fact that we consider a model containing pressureless matter and the chaplygin gas , implies that in principle we ignore the possibility that the chaplygin gas could unify the description of dark energy and dark matter @xcite .",
    "this unification is suggested by the fact that , at perturbative level , the chaplygin gas does not agglomerate at very large scales while it may agglomerate at small scales .",
    "the possible unification of both dark components of the matter content of the universe through the chaplygin gas has increased the interest on this new possible exotic fluid . a recent analysis of type ia supernovae data correlated with the @xmath23 @xcite used extensively this idea , employing the generalized equation of state ( [ geoe ] ) in a flat universe and excluding , _ ab initio _ , the possibility to have a dark matter component .",
    "in this work , the authors tried to restrict the possible values of the parameter @xmath31 , but their results indicate a yet large range of possible values for this parameter . in the ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors studied , using type ia supernovae data , essentially two scenarios : a flat universe with the generalized chaplygin gas and dark matter ; a non - flat universe with the ordinary chaplygin gas and baryonic matter ( with a fixed @xmath32 ) . for the last case ,",
    "the most favoured configuration was obtained for a closed universe with @xmath33 and @xmath34 , using a @xmath35 statistic . as it will be seen later ,",
    "this result is consistent with the more general analysis we will perform here .",
    "the unification program using the chaplygin gas has been recently criticized @xcite . in our opinion",
    "this question remains an open issue , for the following reasons . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors consider a model containing only the chaplygin gas , and find a spectrum for the clustering of matter that is not in agreement with the 2dfgrs observations , unless the parameter @xmath31 in ( [ geoe ] ) is very small , @xmath36 .",
    "however , we must not forget that there are baryons in the universe .",
    "even the quantity of baryons is small , it presences claims at least for a two fluid model , whose behaviour is in general quite different of a single fluid model @xcite .",
    "moreover , we may rise the question of what is really observed in the matter power spectrum . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors are more stringent by stating that , when the large scale structure data are crossed with the cmb data , the likelihood in the configuration space leads to a range of value for the @xmath31 parameter that is very near zero and @xmath37 , i.e. , essentially a cosmological constant model .",
    "however , the cmb analysis suffers from a high degeneracy in the space of the parameters , and the crossing of these data with those coming from type ia supernovae must bring again the chaplygin gas to scene . here",
    ", we open the possibility to have dark matter present , not excluding at the same time the possibility to have a pure @xmath23 .    our goal here , in contrast with the refs .",
    "@xcite , is to perform an extensive and comprehensive analysis of the problem of fitting the type ia supernovae data using the ordinary chaplygin gas given by ( [ eoe ] ) .",
    "this restriction on the parameter @xmath31 keeps us in contact with a string motivation for the chaplygin gas . at the same time",
    ", our intention is to leave space for the presence of other fluids besides the chaplygin gas as well as a spatial curvature term , constraining these parameters ( together with the chaplygin gas sound velocity and the hubble parameter ) only through the confrontation with the supernovae type ia data . in this sense ,",
    "the present work is more general than the previous ones , excepting for the restriction on the equation of state , restriction dictated by the theoretical motivation for the chaplygin gas .",
    "a detailed description of the bayesian statistics method of analysis is presented , as well as the meaning of the observational limits on the different free parameters of the model obtained through this method .",
    "a comparison with the cosmological constant model ( @xmath7 ) is exhibited , which is one of the main purpose of this work .",
    "it will be shown , in particular , that the @xmath23 , in what concerns the supernovae type ia data , favours strongly , at @xmath38 , a closed universe ( @xmath39 ) , peaked in the zero value for the cold dark matter density ( @xmath40 ) and a sound velocity @xmath41 near , but not equal , to the value that corresponds to the cosmological constant .",
    "the present age of the universe is @xmath42 in the @xmath23 , a bit smaller than that in the @xmath43 model ( @xmath44 ) , but still compatible with other astronomical measurements @xcite .",
    "the deceleration parameter is highly negative : @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath23 is always prefered with respect to the @xmath7 model , with a confidence level of @xmath8 when all free parameters are considered .",
    "this confidence level is considerably higher if the curvature or the dark matter density is fixed to zero .",
    "an almost flat universe is predicted if dark mater is absent , @xmath46(@xmath47 ) .",
    "later , we will make a brief comparison between the results obtained with the recent data coming from the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( including the data coming from the wmap ) @xcite , 2dfgrs measurements @xcite and lyman @xmath31 forest @xcite , even if a proper combined analysis is outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "in next section , the chaplygin gas model is described . in section 3 , the bayesian probabilistic analysis is described . in section 4 ,",
    "the cosmological parameters are estimated , and in section 5 our conclusions are presented .",
    "we now proceed by constructing the cosmological model based on the chaplygin gas , which we will test against the type ia supernovae observations .",
    "we must specify the observable cosmological parameters in the model : we will deal with the hubble parameter @xmath30 , the curvature parameter @xmath48 , the dark matter density parameter @xmath26 , the chaplygin gas density parameter @xmath27 and the chaplygin gas sound velocity @xmath49 .",
    "all these parameters are evaluate today .",
    "the sound velocity of the chaplygin gas today , in units of @xmath50 , is given by @xmath51 the ratios of the density fractions with respect to the current critical density are related by @xmath52 . for the chaplygin gas case",
    "we take @xmath53 and @xmath54 , so @xmath55 .",
    "when the limit @xmath56 is taken ( @xmath57 hereafter ) , the cosmological constant model is obtained from the chaplygin model , so @xmath27 is relabeled as @xmath58 ( the ratio of the vacuum energy density with respect to the current critical density ) , and the only range restriction is @xmath59 .",
    "it will be verified that the best - fitting and the bayesian inference suggest @xmath60 , this result becomes quite interesting if we take into account some recent considerations about a unification of cold dark matter and dark energy in chaplygin gas models @xcite .",
    "moreover , closed models will be favoured .",
    "the equation governing the evolution of our model is @xmath61 it can be rewritten as @xmath62 where @xmath30 is the hubble parameter today , @xmath63 ( @xmath64 denoting a matter component and @xmath65 the critical density ) , @xmath66 and the scale factor was normalized to unity today , @xmath67 .",
    "the luminosity distance is obtained by standard procedures @xcite , using the equation for the light trajectory in the above specified background , and its definition , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the absolute luminosity of the source , and @xmath70 is the luminosity measured by the observer .",
    "this expression can be rewritten as @xmath71 @xmath72 being the co - moving distance of the source . taking into account the definitions of absolute and apparent magnitudes in terms of the luminosity @xmath73 and @xmath70 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively ,",

    "the deceleration parameter @xmath87 is defined as @xmath88 , and its value calculated today , using eq .",
    "( [ h2b ] ) , reads @xmath89 so depending on the values of the three parameters above , an accelerating universe ( @xmath90 ) or decelerating universe ( @xmath91 ) is obtained .",
    "when @xmath92 the well - known result for the cosmological constant model is recovered , @xmath93 .    another useful result is the calculation whether the universe will expand eternally or not from the present time .",
    "a simple method used here searches for the roots of @xmath94 in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ h2b ] ) ; if there is one that is a real value and greater than @xmath67 , then the universe is not always expanding in the future .",
    "we proceed by fitting the sne ia data using the model described above .",
    "essentially , we compute the quantity distance moduli , @xmath95 and compare the same distance moduli as obtained from observations .",
    "the quality of the fitting is characterized by the @xmath35 parameter of the least - squares statistic , as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath96 in this expression , @xmath97 is the measured value , @xmath98 is the value calculated through the model described above , @xmath99 is the measurement error , @xmath100 is the dispersion in the distance modulus due to the dispersion in galaxy redshift due to peculiar velocities .",

    ".the sne ia data of the 26 supernovae used in this article , obtained by the template fitting method ( @xmath103 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     tables [ tablecc ] and [ tablegc ] summarizes the bayesian parameter estimation results for seven different cases . as expected , the central values of the bayesian parameter estimation and the best - fitting parameters of tables [ tablebestfitcc ] or [ tablebestfitcg ] are different . in most cases ,",
    "the likelihood functions ( pdf ) of the parameters have a shape similar to a gaussian function , but with some asymmetry , consequently they are not shown here because the central value and credible region description are enough to realize the pdf behaviour .",
    "the parameter estimation of @xmath30 is almost the same for all cases , around @xmath104 with a narrow credible region of @xmath105 .",
    "this estimation is compatible with other sne ia analyses @xcite .",

    "a spatially flat universe is ruled out at @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) confidence level , i.e. , the pdf of @xmath84 is smaller than the pdf of @xmath114 and this region has a cdf of @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) .",

    "but assuming the hypothesis that @xmath47 , describing a universe empty of cold dark matter and totally dominated by the chaplygin gas , we have quite different estimates . for the @xmath23 ,",
    "the bayesian analysis gives @xmath118 , with a closed universe favoured at @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) , and a flat universe is strongly preferred at @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) confidence level , i.e. , the pdf of @xmath84 is smaller than the pdf of @xmath123 and this region has a small cdf of @xmath124 .",
    "the same hypothesis , @xmath47 , applied to the @xmath7 model , leads to the estimation @xmath125 , so now an open universe is quite favourable at @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) confidence level .",
    "a spatially flat universe is ruled out at @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) confidence level , i.e. , the pdf of @xmath84 is smaller than the pdf of @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath47 case clearly discriminates the chaplygin gas and the @xmath7 models , as their estimates are quite different .",

    "as @xmath52 , the probability for a spatially flat universe is on the line @xmath266 , above it we have the region for a closed universe ( @xmath82 , @xmath81 ) , and below , the region for an open universe ( @xmath79 , @xmath78 ) .",
    "the integral of the joint pdf over the upper region gives the likelihood of a closed universe being @xmath108 , althought the joint pdf peak is located in the open universe region .",
    "]    finally , it is useful to analyze the two - dimensional joint pdf , for example , in the parameter space of @xmath267 , where the pdf @xmath268 is given by the integral of @xmath269 over the @xmath30 space .",
    "the well - known credible regions for the @xmath7 model are reproduced here , see figure [ figomegascc ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the probability peak gives @xmath270 which are different from the central values listed in table [ tablecc ] , @xmath271 and @xmath272 , due to the integration over the @xmath170 space to obtain @xmath273 from @xmath268 , and analogously for @xmath274 .",
    "the interpretation is the following : @xmath275 means that these values are the most likely simultaneously values of @xmath276 independent of the parameter @xmath30 ; while @xmath161 is the most likely value of @xmath26 independent of the other parameters @xmath277 , and @xmath272 is the most likely value independent of the other parameters @xmath278 .",
    "figure [ figomegam0 ] shows @xmath273 which is obtained by integrating @xmath268 over the @xmath170 space .",
    "the contour curves are defined such that the enclosed regions have a cumulative probability equal to @xmath141 ( @xmath250 ) , @xmath38 ( @xmath252 ) and @xmath279 ( @xmath254 ) credible levels .",
    "for example , this means simply that @xmath26 and @xmath170 have values simultaneously inside the @xmath38 ( @xmath252 ) region with a likelihood of @xmath252 .",
    "the line @xmath280 represents a spatially flat universe ( @xmath85 , @xmath84 ) , the parameter space above corresponds to a closed universe ( @xmath82 , @xmath81 ) , and below , to an open universe ( @xmath79 , @xmath78 ) . as the closed universe region clearly dominates and presents high pdf values ,",
    "a closed universe is estimated at @xmath111 ( @xmath110 ) confidence level .    for the case of the chaplygin gas model ,",
    "the pdf @xmath281 is a two - dimensional integral given by eq .",
    "( [ pomegam0c0 ] ) , and figure [ figomegasgc ] displays its behaviour with credible regions quite different from the @xmath7 .",
    "the pdf peak is now located at @xmath282 , contrasting with the central values @xmath283 and @xmath284 of table [ tablegc ] , due to the bayesian integrations . of course , the integral of @xmath285 over the @xmath27 space yields @xmath273 , shown in figure [ figomegam0 ] .",
    "once more , a spatially closed universe is strongly favoured at @xmath286 ( @xmath108 ) confidence level , despite the pdf peak being inside the spatially open universe region .",
    "these two graphics also emphasize the totally different likelihoods for @xmath287 in the @xmath23 and @xmath7 model .",
    "this point corresponds to @xmath288 in figure [ figomegascc ] for @xmath7 , with a pdf level of @xmath228 , well below the pdf peak @xmath248 , so a large region of the @xmath289 parameter space has greater pdf than @xmath228 yielding a cdf of @xmath290 ( @xmath291 ) , i.e. , the simultaneously hypothesis of flat universe and @xmath212 ( representing a typical baryonic density parameter of @xmath211 ) is ruled out at @xmath292 ( @xmath291 ) assuming the @xmath43 .",
    "the limit case of @xmath293 gives a confidence level of @xmath224 ( @xmath294 ) .",
    "figure [ figomegasgc ] clearly shows that the point @xmath295 is near the maxima of pdf , their pdf levels are @xmath296 and @xmath262 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the region with smaller pdf than @xmath296 is almost the whole of the parameter space , and its cdf is equal to @xmath297 , i.e , for the @xmath298 the simultaneously hypothesis of flat universe and @xmath236 is favoured at @xmath297 ( @xmath299 ) confidence level . in the same way ,",
    "the case of @xmath293 is favoured at a confidence level of @xmath300 ( @xmath301 ) .",
    "in the present paper constraints on a chaplygin gas model using type ia supernovae data were settled out using a bayesian statistics .",
    "the model contains as matter content the chaplygin gas and a pressureless fluid , whose density parameters are @xmath27 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "the curvature term @xmath48 , the sound velocity of the chaplygin gas @xmath302 and the hubble parameter @xmath30 are also free parameters . at the @xmath303 level ,",
    "the results indicate @xmath304 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath305 , @xmath306 , @xmath42 and @xmath45 .",
    "this results must be compared with those obtained replacing the chaplygin gas by the cosmological constant ( @xmath177 ) , for which @xmath307 , @xmath308 , @xmath309 , @xmath310 , @xmath311 and @xmath312 .",
    "the @xmath23 is more likely than the @xmath7 model with a confidence level of @xmath8 when all free parameters are considered .",
    "this percentage is much higher if some restriction on the parameters are imposed : fixing @xmath313 , the @xmath23 becomes preferred with respect to @xmath7 at @xmath209 ; this confidence level mounts to @xmath10 if , instead , @xmath314 .",
    "the bayesian analysis of the flat case with chaplygin gas and baryonic matter ( @xmath11 ) implies that the @xmath23 is preferred with respect to the @xmath7 model at @xmath12 confidence level .  in general ,",
    "the predicted value for the sound velocity of the chaplygin gas is close to the cosmological constant value ( @xmath177 ) , but after integrating on the various parameters the @xmath7 case becomes quite disfavoured .    other important differences between the @xmath23 and @xmath7 concern the pressureless matter parameter and the age of the universe .",
    "for the former , the @xmath23 favours a zero value for this cold dark matter component , in agreement with the idea that the chaplygin gas may unify dark matter and dark energy , and in contrast with @xmath7 where a non - negligible fraction of the matter in the universe must appear under the form of dark matter .",
    "a very remarkable discrimination between the @xmath23 and @xmath7 occurs when the pressureless matter parameter represents the baryonic matter , @xmath315 and the universe is spatially flat .",
    "this case is favoured at @xmath297 of confidence level for the @xmath23 , while for the @xmath7 model it is excluded with @xmath292 of confidence level .",
    "this result renders the @xmath23 quite attractive in view of the predictions of almost all primordial inflationary scenarios , which lead to a flat universe , and also in view of the unification program for dark energy and dark matter through the chaplygin gas .",
    "one of the most important conclusions of this work is that the predicted value for the dark matter parameter @xmath26 is peaked in the zero value .",
    "this reinforces the idea that the chaplygin gas may unify dark matter and dark energy as its behaviour in terms of the scale factor suggests .",
    "this unification program has been criticized @xcite because , besides some other reasons , the matter power spectrum in a pure @xmath23 exhibits oscillations that are not observed in the recent @xmath316 data , and the phase space of possible configuration is highly concentrated around the cosmological constant value .",
    "this seems to be a strong argument against the unified model .",
    "however , we must remark that the authors of ref . @xcite",
    "employ an one fluid model . even if the @xmath23 may unify dark matter and dark energy , baryons exists anyway , even if in a small fraction ( @xmath317 ) .",
    "this may seems to be irrelevant , but the behaviour of a two fluid models is generally very different from an one fluid model ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and this point deserves , in our opinion , a deeper analysis . in what concerns the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we observe that the crossing of all observational data , including type ia supernovae , may put the chaplygin gas again at a competitive level with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "our results indicate clearly that the chaplygin gas is preferred with respect to @xmath7 if only type ia supernovae data is taken into account .",
    "the @xmath23 predicts a universe younger than @xmath7 , but still in agreement with other astronomical data , in particular with the age of globular clusters",
    ". both models favour a closed universe , with a very small difference for the value of the curvature parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of the hubble parameter is essentially the same in both models , as well as the deceleration parameter @xmath239 , for which the data indicate a highly negative value , near @xmath318 .",
    "the value of the deceleration parameter becomes less negative for a flat universe and when @xmath298 is absent .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , statistics of gravitational lenses where used to constrain the proportion of dark matter and chaplygin gas in a flat universe , and the authors found @xmath319 .",
    "we remark also that our results are consistent with the particular case described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these results may be compared with those recently obtained from the @xmath320 observatory for the spectrum of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "using also the @xmath316 and lyman-@xmath31 forest data , and fixing a @xmath7 model , it has been obtained that @xmath321 , @xmath322 , where @xmath323 , and @xmath324 .",
    "we notice that the dark matter component is much smaller than the value deduced from the supernovae data for @xmath325 ( @xmath132 ) , and at same time the hubble parameter is greater .",
    "the smaller uncertainty on the dark matter component is natural in this case , since the cmb spectrum gives a better estimation on the total matter in the universe through the position of the first acoustic peak , and it is verified that an almost flat universe is favoured by the data , for the @xmath7 model , in contrast with what the supernovae data indicate for the same theoretical framework .    for the @xmath23",
    "there is a large uncertainty also in the estimation of the curvature parameter if only supernovae data are used .",
    "but , its quite remarkable that , if the dark matter density is fixed to zero in this model the type ia supernovae data indicates an almost flat universe : @xmath326 .",
    "it must be stressed that a proper comparison between the @xmath320 results with our analysis for the chaplygin gas requires that the @xmath320 data must be analysed using the @xmath23 , what is one of the natural extension of the present work .",
    "we hope that , in the future , more sne ia data ( from the snap project @xcite , etc ) with small observational errors will impose stringent constraints on the parameter estimation for the @xmath23 and the @xmath43 model , so the parameter credible regions become narrow enough to rule out one of these cosmological models .",
    "for example , the estimation of the parameter @xmath175 could favour one of the models with high confidence level ( @xmath327 ) , the estimation of @xmath26 and @xmath231 could be incompatible with other independent and well accepted estimations therefore excluding some cosmological models , etc .",
