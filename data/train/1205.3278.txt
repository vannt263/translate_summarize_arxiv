    "despite more than half a century of history , anderson localization@xcite is still a very active field whose influence spreads throughout all of physics , from condensed matter to wave propagation and imaging .",
    "@xcite a special field where most of rigorous results on anderson localization have been obtained , are one - dimensional and quasi - one - dimensional systems with uncorrelated disorder .",
    "most of the efforts in this direction were made to obtain the statistics of localized wave functions in strictly one - dimensional continuous systems  @xcite or tight - binding chains ( see the recent work ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "alternatively , the limit of thick multi - channel @xmath0 wires has been studied by the nonlinear super - symmetric sigma - model.@xcite    a transfer matrix approach which allows one to consider any number of channels @xmath1 was suggested by gertsenshtein and vasilev in the field of random waveguides.@xcite this approach has been applied to the problem of anderson localization by dorokhov@xcite and later on by mello , pereyra and kumar ( dmpk).@xcite it is similar in spirit to the derivation of the fokker - planck equation ( the diffusion equation ) from the langevin equation of motion for a brownian particle .",
    "however , in the present case an elementary step of dynamics in time is replaced by the scattering off an `` elementary slice '' of the @xmath1-channel wire . as a result ,",
    "a kind of fokker - planck equation arises which describes diffusion in the space of parameters of the scattering matrix @xmath2 , in which the role of time is played by the co - ordinate along the quasi - one - dimensional system .",
    "usually the scattering matrix @xmath2 is decomposed in a multiplicative way by the bargmann s parametrization@xcite which separates the `` angle variables '' of the @xmath3-rotation matrices and the @xmath1 eigenvalues @xmath4 of the transmission matrix . if the probability distribution of the scattering matrix is assumed invariant under rotation of the local basis ( _ isotropy assumption _ ) , the canonical dmpk equation@xcite may be obtained , which has the form of a fokker - planck equation in the space of @xmath1 transmission eigenvalues .",
    "this equation was solved in ref .   for an arbitrary number @xmath1 of transmission channels .",
    "the isotropy condition is not automatically fulfilled .",
    "it is believed that the isotropy condition is valid for a large number @xmath0 of well coupled chains where the `` elementary slice '' is a macroscopic object and the `` local maximum entropy ansatz '' applies.@xcite it is valid at weak disorder in a strictly one - dimensional chain in the continuum limit @xmath5 , or for a one - dimensional chain with finite lattice constant @xmath6 outside the center - of - band anomaly . in this case",
    "the distribution of the only angular variable describing a @xmath7 rotation , the scattering phase , is indeed flat.@xcite    however , the case of _ few _",
    "( @xmath8 ) coupled chains is much more complicated . as was pointed out originally by dorokhov@xcite , and later on by tartakovski,@xcite in this case the angular and radial variables , are entangled in the fokker - planck equation .",
    "these are the variables determining the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the transmission matrix , respectively .",
    "we will refer to this generic fokker - planck equation as the _ extended _ dmpk equation in order to distinguish it from the _ canonical _ dmpk equation which contains only the radial part of the laplace - beltrami operator .",
    "the minimal model where such an entanglement is unavoidable , is the two - leg model of @xmath9 coupled disordered chains .    yet",
    "this case is important not only as a minimal system where the canonical dmpk equation breaks down .",
    "it is relevant for the anderson localization of linearly mixed hybrid particles such as polaritons.@xcite polaritons are the result of coherent mixing of the electromagnetic field in a medium ( photons in a waveguide for example ) and excitations of matter ( excitons ) . in the absence of disorder photons have a much larger group velocity than excitons , and thus one subsystem is fast while the other one is slow . as a specific example , quasi - one - dimensional resonators were recently fabricated by confining electromagnetic fields inside a semiconductor rod  @xcite or to a sequence of quantum wells .",
    "@xcite in such resonators the dispersion of transverse - quantized photons is quadratic in the small momentum , with an effective mass as small as @xmath10 of the effective mass of the wannier - mott exciton which is of the order of the mass of a free electron .    disorder is unavoidable in such systems due to the imperfections of the resonator boundary and impurities .",
    "in many cases one can consider only one mode of transverse quantization for both the photon and the exciton .",
    "thus a model of two dispersive modes ( particles ) with parametrically different transport properties arise . due to the large dipole moment of the exciton these particles",
    "are mixed , resulting in avoided mode crossing . on top of that",
    ", disorder acts on both of them , whereby its effect on the two channels can be rather different  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see  @xcite that this system maps one - to - one onto a single particle model of two coupled chains in the presence of disorder .",
    "ref .   solved the coupled dyson equations for the green s functions of exciton and cavity phonon numerically , focussing on the so - called `` motional narrowing '' in the reflectivity spectra of normal incidence  @xcite .",
    "however , the issue of localization of cavity polaritons was not raised .",
    "the latter was addressed in ref .  , which analyzed the scattering of electromagnetic waves in a disordered quantum - well structure supporting excitons .",
    "the random susceptibility of excitons in each quantum well was shown to induce disorder for the light propagation , and the dyson equation for the green s function of the electromagnetic wave was then solved by the self - consistent theory of localization .",
    "the author reached the conclusion that the localization length of light with frequencies within the polariton spectrum is substantially decreased due to enhanced backscattering of light near the excitonic resonance .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with our exact and more general study of the coupled disordered two - leg problem .",
    "the latter also finds natural applications in nanostructures and electronic propagation in heterogeneous biological polymers , such as dna molecules  @xcite .",
    "the main question we are asking in the present paper is : what happens to the localization properties when a fast chain is coupled to a slow one ?",
    "will the fast chain dominate the localization of the hybrid particle ( e.g. a polariton ) or the slow one ?",
    "in other words : will the smallest lyapunov exponent of the two - leg system ( the inverse localization length ) be similar to the one of the isolated fast chain , or rather to the one of the isolated slow chain ?",
    "can the presence of the `` more strongly quantum '' component ( photon ) help the `` more classical '' component ( exciton ) to get out of the swamp of localization ?",
    "this latter question can be asked in many different physical situations .",
    "it has been referred to as the `` mnchhausen effect '' in ref .  , to describe the following effect predicted for a dc squid ( superconducting quantum interference device ) with two biased josephson junctions , one with small plasma frequency ( large mass ) , the other one with large plasma frequency ( small mass ) : the junction with small mass can actually drag the `` slower '' junction ( larger mass ) out of its metastable state . here",
    "we give an answer in the specific situation of a single hybrid particle .",
    "more interesting situations may arise when interacting and non - equilibrium polaritons are approaching bose - condensation.@xcite    a further question of more general interest can be addressed by the same model problem .",
    "namely , consider two or more coupled channels with similar propagation speed ( i.e. , inverse effective mass ) , but different disorder level : which channel will dominate the localization , the cleaner or the more disordered one ?",
    "this type of question arises not only in these hybrid single particle problems , but is an important element in the analysis of many particle problems , where few and many particle excitations have various channels of propagation ( e.g. , all particles moving together , or moving in subgroups of fewer particles ) .",
    "it is an important , but scarcely understood question , what determines the character of the propagation of such excitations when many parallel , but coupled channels with different transport characteristics exist .",
    "intuitively one expects the fastest , and least disordered channel to dominate the delocalization .",
    "however , our analytical solution of the hybrid two - leg chain shows that in the one - dimensional case , this intuition is not always correct . instead we find that , when the channels are strongly mixing with each other , it is the largest rate of back scattering , i.e. , the more disordered chain , which dominates the physics .",
    "this may be seen as one of the many manifestations of the fact that in one dimension the localization length is essentially set by the mean free path .",
    "our solution of the two chain problem furnishes a useful benchmark for approximate solutions in more complex and interacting situations .",
    "however , we caution that the phenomenology may be quite different in higher dimensions",
    ". we will discuss this further in the conclusion .",
    "the answer to the above questions will be obtained analytically from the exact solution of the two - leg ( two - chain ) anderson localization model .",
    "this solution represents a major technical advance , because for the first time a model , which leads to an extended dmpk equation with non - separable angular and radial variables , is exactly solved . without going into details our results are the following :    \\(i ) the answer depends qualitatively on whether or not the system is close to the _ resonance energy _",
    "@xmath11 , which is defined as the energy where the dispersion curves of the two corresponding decoupled disorder - free chains intersect ( see fig .  [ disper ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) _ near the resonance _ the presence of the fast leg does not help to substantially delocalize the slow component ( see fig .",
    "[ scale ] ) .",
    "the localization length of a hybrid particle is at most by a factor of @xmath12 larger than the one of the slow particle ( see eqs .",
    "( [ loc - length - e-0 ] ) and ( [ c1 ] ) ) , being parametrically smaller than that of the fast particle .",
    "thus the slow particle dominates the localization properties of the hybrid particle near the resonance energy @xmath11 .",
    "\\(iii ) a particular case where the resonance happens at all energies is the case of two coupled identical chains subject to different disorder ( see fig .",
    "[ neq - disorder ] ) . in this case",
    "the dominance of the more disordered chain extends to all energies thus pushing the localization length of the ladder sharply down compared to that of the less disordered isolated chain .",
    "\\(iv ) _ away from the resonance _ the wavefunctions stay either mostly on the slow leg , being strongly localized . or",
    "they have their main weight on the fast leg , and hybridize here and there with the slow leg ( see fig .  [ disper ] and fig .",
    "[ band - edge ] ) .",
    "it is this second type of wavefunctions which helps excitations on the slow leg to delocalize due to the presence of the faster leg , even though this happens with small probability far from the resonance .",
    "\\(v ) a very peculiar behavior occurs _ near the band - edges _ of the slow particle , where the system switches from two to one propagating channels . just below the band - edge the localization length of the hybrid particle decreases",
    "dramatically being driven down by the localization length of the slow chain that vanishes at the band - edge ( neglecting the lifshitz tails ) . above the band - edge",
    "the localization length of a hybrid particle sharply recovers , approaching the value typical for the one - chain problem . thus near the band - edge the localization length of the two - leg system has a sharp minimum , which is well reproduced by direct numerical simulations ( see fig .",

    "the hamiltonian  ( [ full - ham ] ) is a generic model describing two coupled , uniformly disordered chains .",
    "moreover , the model can also be adopted as an effective model to describe non - interacting excitations with two linearly mixing channels of propagation in the presence of disorder .",

    "we analyze the model qualitatively in terms of effective disorder and bare mixing angle before carrying out the detailed calculation . as already discussed above , either one or two propagating channels",
    "are permitted at a given energy .",
    "this leads to two distinct mechanisms of localization in the bulk of the energy band :    \\(i ) _ two - channel regime_. in this case , the physics is dominated by the mixing angle @xmath74 . if @xmath78 or @xmath79 , the mixing of the two channels is weak : the magnitudes of off - diagonal elements of matrix   ( [ ham2-ip ] ) are much smaller than the magnitudes of the diagonal elements .",

    "however , if @xmath80 , the magnitudes of the off - diagonal elements are of the same order as the diagonal elements .",

    "\\(ii ) _ one - channel regime_. the single - channel case has been solved by berezinskii@xcite and melnikov@xcite in the case of a single chain .",
    "the results they obtained can be applied in our problem by substituting the variance of disorder and rapidity of the propagating channel with the corresponding quantities .",
    "however , we have to emphasize here that even if only one channel exists , coupling effects still present , since both the effective disorder and the rapidity in the remaining channel depend on the transport properties of both legs . in the one - channel regime the second channel is still present , but supports only evanescent modes .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ one - channel ] that the effect of the evanescent channel on the propagating one is subleading when disorder is weak .      the fokker - planck approach and its related notations , such as the transfer matrix , the s - matrix etc .",

    "we only outline the methodology here . the fokker - planck approach to one- or quasi - one dimensional systems with static disorder at zero temperature",
    "is based on studying the statistical distribution of random transfer matrices for a system of finite length .",
    "an ensemble of such transfer matrices is constructed by imposing appropriate symmetry constraints . in the present model",
    "there are two underlying symmetries : _ time - reversal invariance _ and _ current conservation _ , which dramatically reduce the number of free parameters of transfer matrices .",
    "after a proper parametrization , the probability distribution function of these parameters completely describes the ensemble of transfer matrices , and therefore totally determines the statistical distributions of many macroscopic quantities of the system , such as the conductance , etc . in order to obtain the probability distribution function of the free parameters , a stochastic evolution - like procedure is introduced by computing the variation of the probability distribution function of these parameters in a `` bulk '' system as an extra impurity `` slice ''",
    "is patched on one of its terminals , under the assumption that the patched slice is statistically independent of the bulk .",
    "thereby , we construct a markovian process for the probability distribution function .",
    "this is described by a kind of fokker - planck equation in the parameter space of the transfer matrix with the length of the system as the time variable .",

    "the fast chain corresponds to the electromagnetic modes ( `` light '' ) confined in a one - dimensional structure and therefore having a parabolic dispersion with a very small mass ( large @xmath602 ) at small wave vectors .",

    "the amplitude of the wavefunction of the exciton s center - of - mass is more difficult to access , but in principle still possible , e.g. via stimulated or spontaneous exciton recombination and the related radiation .",
    "another application is related with one - dimensional structures in cold - atom traps . by this technique",
    "one can construct and study coupled one - dimensional chains in the same way as it was recently done for a single chain  @xcite .",
    "while all possible regimes can be achieved in a system of cold atoms , the most relevant regime for one - dimensional cavity polaritons is that described in fig .",
    "[ disper](b ) , where for each band ( the lower and the upper polariton bands ) only one channel exists .",
    "this is because the exciton - light coupling is typically stronger than the narrow bandwidth @xmath604 of the excitons .",
    "the localization length in the case relevant for the upper exciton - polaritons is shown in fig .",
    "[ sig - chanl ] .",
    "as expected , the localization length tends to zero near the bottom and the top of the band , due to the vanishing rapidity . note that in the context of polaritons the upper band edge does not exist , since the light has an unbounded continuous spectrum .",
    "in our model the top of the band appears merely due to the discreteness of the lattice . in the center of the band",
    "the localization length is of the order of the localization length for the uncoupled `` light '' component .",
    "more important is the distribution of amplitudes of `` light '' and `` exciton '' wavefunctions which are similar to fig .",
    "[ wavefun](a ) , with `` light '' being represented by the wave function @xmath605 on the fast leg and the `` exciton '' part being represented by the wave function @xmath606 on the slow leg .",
    "one can see that the coupling to light makes the exciton wave function spread over a distance @xmath607 of the order of the localization length of light .",
    "this is much larger than the maximum exciton localization length @xmath552 in the absence of coupling .",
    "the price for the `` fast transit '' is that the amplitude of the exciton wave function is small .",
    "this means that the transfer of a locally created exciton to distances of order @xmath529 is possible , but occurs with reduced probability .    in the long search for light localization ( see the paper by a. lagendijk , b. van tiggelen and d. s. wiersma in ref .  ) the crucial point was to achieve a smaller localization length of light .",
    "our results show that this can also be achieved by coupling light to excitons near the bottom of the upper polariton band .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the model considered above does not take into account an important property of polaritons , namely their finite lifetime due to recombination of excitons , and the out - coupling of the light from the waveguide .",
    "this limits the coherence of polaritons and inhibits anderson localization .",
    "more precisely , the effects of anderson localization are only relevant if the time to diffuse up to the scale of the localization length ( which by thouless argument is of the order of the inverse level spacing in the localization volume ) is smaller than the life time of the excitons .",
    "further crucial aspects are interactions among polaritons at finite density , and the related possibility of interaction - induced delocalization and bose condensation of polaritons .",
    "@xcite a complete theory of localization of hybrid particles like polaritons should take into account all these issues.@xcite    let us finally discuss the role of dimension for our results .",
    "we have found that under resonant conditions the localization lengths of two coupled chains are of the order of the localization length of the more localized , uncoupled leg .",
    "we may interpret this phenomenon as a manifestation of the fact that in 1d the mean free path is the relevant length scale that sets the localization length .",
    "insofar it is not surprising that the backscattering rate , and thus the `` worst '' leg of the chains determines the localization properties of a coupled system .",
    "however , the close relation ( proportionality ) between mean free path and localization length is special for one - dimensional systems .",
    "in contrast in two dimensions the localization length becomes parametrically larger than the mean free path at weak disorder . in @xmath608",
    "most eigenstates are even delocalized in weak disorder .",
    "accordingly , we expect that the localization length is not so simply determined by the properties of the more disordered part among two coupled systems .",
    "nevertheless , since the proliferation of weak - localization and backscattering leads to complete localization also in 2d ( in the absence of special symmetries ) , we expect that a well propagating channel becomes more strongly localized upon resonant coupling to a more disordered channel .",
    "this may apply , e.g. , to 2d polariton systems .",
    "however , in higher dimensions @xmath608 such a coupling might have a rather weak effect .",
    "we expect that a `` fast '' channel is not affected much by a more disordered parallel channel .",
    "that such a trend exists indeed at high enough dimensions can be shown in the case of two coupled bethe lattices ,  @xcite which can be viewed as the limit of arbitrarily high dimensions .",
