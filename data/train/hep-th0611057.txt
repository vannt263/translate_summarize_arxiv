    "the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg xxz chain is one of the most fundamental models for one - dimensional quantum magnetism , which is given by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the pauli matrices acting on the @xmath3-th site , @xmath4 is the anisotropy parameter , and @xmath5 is the number of lattice sites of this system . here",
    "we impose the periodic boundary condition @xmath6 . for @xmath7",
    ", it is called the massive xxz model where the system is gapful .",
    "meanwhile for @xmath8 case , the system is gapless and called the massless xxz model . especially we call it xxx model for the isotropic case @xmath9 .    the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this model can be obtained by the bethe ansatz method @xcite .",
    "we shall give a brief survey of this method below .",
    "first we assume the wave function @xmath10 with @xmath11 down spins in the form @xmath12 |n_1, ... ,n_m\\ket , \\nn\\\\ & a(\\sg)=\\epsilon(\\sg)\\prod_{l < j}\\(e^{i(k_{\\sg(l)}+k_{\\sg(j ) } ) } + 1 - 2\\d e^{ik_{\\sg(l)}}\\ ) , \\label{wf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 denotes an element of the symmetric group @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the sign of the permutation , and @xmath16 signifies the state where the spins at the positions @xmath17 are downward and all the other spins directing upward . if the quasi - momenta @xmath18 satisfy the bethe ansatz equations @xmath19 the wave function ( [ wf ] ) becomes the eigenvector of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) : @xmath20 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath21 , the ground state energy per site @xmath22 of the massless xxz model , for example , is computable by analyzing the bethe ansatz equations @xmath23}{\\sh t\\ch(\\nu t ) } ,   \\label{e0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we parametrize the anisotropy parameter as @xmath24 . especially in the xxx case @xmath9 ,",
    "the ground state energy per site ( [ e0 ] ) can be simplified into @xmath25 in the same way other physical quantities in the thermodynamic limit such as specific heat , magnetic susceptibility , elementary excitations , etc ... , can be exactly evaluated even at finite temperature by the bethe ansatz method @xcite .",
    "the exact calculation of the correlation functions , however , is still a difficult problem even in the simplest case for static correlation functions at zero temperature .",
    "the exceptional case is @xmath26 , where the system reduces to a lattice free - fermion model by the jordan - wigner transformation . in this case",
    ", we can calculate arbitrary correlation functions by means of wick s theorem @xcite .",
    "however , there have been rapid developments recently in the exact evaluations of correlation functions for @xmath27 case also .",
    "below we shall give the historical review of them , concentrating mainly on the static correlation functions of the xxx model @xmath9 at zero temperature for the infinite system @xmath21 . until quite recently",
    "only the correlation functions within three lattice sites had been known : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the alternating zeta function defined by @xmath30 , which is related to riemann zeta function @xmath31 as @xmath32 .",
    "note that the alternating zeta function is regular at @xmath33 and is given by @xmath34 .",
    "the nearest - neighbor correlation function ( [ first_neighbor ] ) is derived directly from the ground state energy ( [ e0xxx ] ) obtained by hulthn in 1938 @xcite .",
    "the first nontrivial correlation function ( [ second_neighbor ] ) was derived by takahashi in 1977 via the strong coupling expansion of the ground state energy for the half - filled hubbard model @xcite .",
    "note also that another derivation of the second - neighbor correlation function ( [ second_neighbor ] ) was given by dittrich and inozemtsev in 1997 @xcite .",
    "these method , however , can not be generalized to calculate further correlation functions on more than four lattice sites , unfortunately .",
    "meanwhile using the representation theory of the quantum affine algebra @xmath35 , kyoto group ( jimbo , miki , miwa , nakayashiki ) derived a multiple integral representation for arbitrary correlation functions of the massive xxz antiferromagnetic chain in 1992 @xcite , which is before long extended to the xxx case @xcite and the massless xxz case @xcite .",
    "more recently the same integral representations were reproduced by kitanine , maillet , terras @xcite in the framework of quantum inverse scattering method .",
    "they have also succeeded in generalizing the integral representations to the xxz model with an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "more recently the integral formulas are extended to the xxz model even at finite temperature ! @xcite . in this way",
    "it has been established now the correlation functions on @xmath36 lattice sites are represented by @xmath36-dimensional integrals in general .",
    "however , these multiple integral representations for correlation functions , though completely exact , have not been used widely especially among physicists .",
    "it is mainly because we can not evaluate accurate numerical values of correlation functions directly from the integral representation .",
    "also it had been a puzzle that the exact expression of the correlation function on three lattice sites ( [ second_neighbor ] ) had not been reproduced from the integral representation for a long time .",
    "the situation changed when boos and korepin devised an innovative method to evaluate these multiple integrals for xxx chain in 2001 @xcite .",
    "they showed that the integrand in the multiple integral formula can be reduced to a _",
    "canonical _ form , which allows us to implement the integration .",
    "this method was at first applied to a special correlation function called emptiness formation probability ( efp ) @xcite which signifies the probability to find a ferromagnetic string of length @xmath36 : @xmath37 by performing the multiple integrals , the explicit forms of the efp for up to @xmath38 was obtained @xcite .",
    "the boos - korepin method was applied to calculate other correlation functions on four lattice sites in 2003 @xcite .",
    "especially the third - neighbor correlation function was obtained there as @xmath39 other correlation functions on four lattice sites are given in appendix a.    subsequently , the boos - korepin method was generalized to xxz chain both in massless and massive regime and all the correlation functions within four lattice sites were obtained for general anisotropy @xcite .    in principle ,",
    "multiple integrals for any correlation functions can be performed by means of boos - korepin method .",
    "however , @xmath40 is the only correlation function which was calculated by this method on five lattice sites , since it is getting critically harder to reduce the integrand to canonical form as the integral dimension increases .    in the course of attempting to obtain further correlation functions , the alternative algebraic method to calculate the efp was developed by boos , korepin and smirnov in 2003 @xcite .",
    "they considered the inhomogeneous xxx model , in which each site carries an inhomogeneous parameter @xmath41 .",
    "the homogeneous xxx model corresponds to the case with all the inhomogeneous parameters @xmath41 set to be @xmath42 .",
    "inhomogeneous correlation functions on @xmath36 lattice sites are considered to be functions of variables @xmath43 .",
    "they derived the functional relations which the inhomogeneous efp should satisfy by investigating the quantum knizhnik - zamolodchikov ( qkz ) equations @xcite , the solutions to which are connected with the inhomogeneous correlation functions @xcite .",
    "moreover they suggested an ansatz for the form of the inhomogeneous efp , which consists of only one transcendental function @xmath44 with rational functions of inhomogeneous parameters @xmath43 as coefficients .",
    "( for the proof of the ansatz and further generalizations , see @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown that the functional relations together with the ansatz for the final form completely fix the explicit form of the inhomogeneous efp . in this way",
    "the explicit forms of the inhomogeneous efp for up to @xmath45 have been obtained , which gives a new result for @xmath46 in the homogeneous limit @xmath47 .",
    "this boos - korepin - smirnov method based on the qkz equation was generalized to arbitrary correlation functions in @xcite .",
    "actually , in that paper , all the correlation functions on five lattice sites are obtained based on the functional relations for the general correlation functions ( see appendix a ) .",
    "especially the fourth - neighbor correlation function is given by @xmath48 the main purpose of this paper is to report further results using the algebraic method in @xcite .",
    "more explicitly we have succeeded in calculating all the correlation functions on six lattice sites using this algebraic method .",
    "we remark that , if we consider only the two - point correlation functions @xmath49 , it was already calculated up to the seventh - neighbor correlation function @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the method actually allows us to evaluate some other correlation functions such as string correlation functions @xcite , but not all the correlation functions .",
    "we also remark that there is a related but different approach for the evaluation of the general correlation functions , which is developed recently by boos , jimbo , miwa , smirnov and takeyama @xcite .",
    "they have established a compact exponential formula for general correlation functions without heavy multiple integrals , which would be also useful to evaluate correlation functions analytically .",
    "we , however , do not discuss the formula in this paper .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the algebraic method to calculate general correlation functions is reviewed . in section 3 , we present the analytical results for some physically interesting correlation functions , such as chiral correlation functions , dimer - dimer correlation functions , etc@xmath51 . in section 4 , we show the eigenvalue - distribution of the reduced density matrix and calculate the von neumann entropy .",
    "summary and discussion are given in section 5 .",
    "below we describe the functional approach to evaluate general correlation functions established in @xcite . any correlation function can be expressed as a sum of density matrix elements @xmath52 , which are defined by the ground state expectation value of the product of elementary matrices : @xmath53 where @xmath54 are @xmath55 elementary matrices acting on the @xmath3-th site as @xmath56}=\\frac12+s_j^z , \\quad e^{--}_j=\\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\\0&1\\\\\\end{pmatrix}_{\\!\\![j]}=\\frac12-s_j^z , \\nn\\\\ e^{+-}_j&=\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\0&0\\\\\\end{pmatrix}_{\\!\\![j]}=s_j^+=s_j^x+i s_j^y , \\quad e^{-+}_j=\\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\\1&0\\\\\\end{pmatrix}_{\\!\\![j]}=s_j^-=s_j^x - i s_j^y . \\nn\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for example , the density matrix elements on four lattice sites @xmath57 can be written in terms of spin operators as @xmath58 first we rewrite the functional relations for inhomogeneous density matrix elements , which follow from the qkz equations :    * translational invariance @xmath59 * transposition , negating and reverse order relations @xmath60 * intertwining relation @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the @xmath62-matrix of the xxx model : @xmath63 * first recurrent relation @xmath64 * second recurrent relation @xmath65 * identity relation @xmath66 * reduction relation @xmath67    additionally it is established that density matrix elements can be written in the form of @xcite @xmath68}\\sum_{\\sg\\in t_{n , l } } a^{\\epds{1}{n}}_{\\eps{1}{n}}(l,\\sg| \\lam_{\\sg(1)},\\cdots,\\lam_{\\sg(n ) } ) \\prod_{j=1}^l\\omega(\\lam_{\\sg(2j-1)}-\\lam_{\\sg(2j ) } ) ,   \\label{form}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is a subset of the symmetry group of degree @xmath36 defined as @xmath70 @xmath71 are rational functions of inhomogeneous parameters @xmath43 with known denominator @xmath72 @xmath73 are polynomials of known degree in inhomogeneous parameters @xmath43 with rational coefficients which have at most the same degree in each variable and also at most the same total degree as in the denominator .    a transcendental function @xmath44 in ( [ form ] )",

    "the following properties of the function @xmath44 are needed for calculations of the recurrent relations ( [ rec1])-([rec2 ] ) : @xmath76    below we list the explicit forms of all the non - zero elements of inhomogeneous density matrices for @xmath77 : @xmath78 it can be easily seen that these satisfy the functional relations ( [ f1])-([f2 ] ) . by taking the homogeneous limit @xmath79",

    "namely , without evaluating all the density matrix elements , a two - point correlation function can be derived from its generating function @xmath87 through the relation @xmath88 note that the generating function @xmath89 can be considered as a generalization of the emptiness formation probability ( [ efp ] ) , which is reproduced if we set @xmath90 in ( [ gf ] ) . from the functional relations for general density matrix elements ( [ f1])-([f2 ] ) , it can be shown that the generating function @xmath89 satisfies the following closed functional relations :    * translational invariance @xmath91 * negating relation @xmath92 * symmtry relation @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes any element of the symmetry group @xmath14 .",

    "it has been observed that they have simple expressions @xcite compared with the other correlation functions on the same lattice sites @xmath103 here we have newly obtained the vector chiral correlation function for six lattice sites , which has also a simple form though it contains some quadratic terms @xmath104 it is interesting to note that the numerical values of these are all negative and their absolute values are oscillating .",
