    "the compression of cold gas initially induces sf in the galaxy , while the stripping of the disk and halo gas causes an eventual decrease in sf in the galaxy .",
    "rp is an essential physical process that controls sf histories and gas evolution in disk galaxies .",
    "these previous studies have not extensively investigated how rp of icm in group and cluster environments can influence the evolution of hi and @xmath0 components of disk galaxies .",
    "yagi et al . ( 2013 ) showed that sf occurs in the stripped tails from galaxies under rp , stripping of @xmath0 from a disk galaxy would cause faster sf - quenching in the galaxy as it is the direct fuel in the sf process .",
    "hi stripping only aids in the eventual ` strangulation ' of the galaxy and is a more long term effect on the galaxy evolution .",
    "compression of the @xmath0 left in the disk galaxy induces sf due to an increase in density and interactions of @xmath0 .",
    "further work into the rp effect on @xmath0 is necessary to understand the formation and evolution of the cold gas in disk galaxies within group and cluster environments .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to show , for the first time , that strong rp can significantly enhance @xmath0 formation on dust grains in disk galaxies based on the results of numerical simulations .",
    "we also show how this enhancement of @xmath0 formation depends on model parameters such as orbits within groups / clusters and disk inclination angles with respect to their orbital planes .",
    "since @xmath0 is the key parameter in the formation of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) and thus star formation , we discuss the present new results in the context of galaxy - wide @xmath0 formation and star formation within dense galaxy environments . in the present work",
    ", we do not discuss the origin of the shock - excited @xmath0 in disk galaxies , which has been recently discovered by wong et al .",

    "2012 ; hopkins et al . 2014 ) is the self - consistent time evolution of dust abundances deriving h2 abundances used in the present study , whereas others used constant dust - to - metal ratios ( i.e. , no evolution of dust abundances ) . in the present study ,",
    "a disk galaxy moves in a cluster with a halo dark matter ( dm ) mass , @xmath1 , and an icm temperature , @xmath2 , allowing its cold gas to be influenced by rp of the icm .",

    "the disk galaxy is composed of dark matter halo , stellar disk , stellar bulge and gaseous disk , similar to the milky way ( mw - type ) .",
    "the total masses of dark matter halo , stellar disk , gas disk , and bulge are set to be @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . the mass ratio of dark matter halo to disk is fixed at 16.7 .",
    "we adopt the density distribution of the nfw halo ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) suggested from cdm simulations , with @xmath7-parameter and virial radius set to 10 and 245 kpc , respectively .",

    "the maximum hydrogen density in the present simulation is @xmath20 @xmath21 , which is significantly lower than @xmath0 density of molecular clouds ( mcs ) cores ( @xmath22 @xmath21 ) .",
    "this lack of resolution for mcs cores will not be a problem in this study , because we focus exclusively on galaxy - scale @xmath0 distribution .    to avoid a large number of gas particles to represent the entire icm ( e.g. , abadi et al .",
    "1999 ) , it is represented by @xmath23 sph particles in a cube with the size of @xmath24 and a disk galaxy is placed in the exact centre .",
    "the initial velocity of each sph particle for the icm is set to be ( @xmath25 , 0 , 0 ) , where @xmath26 is determined by the position of the galaxy with respect to the cluster centre .",

    "the mass of icm particle is time - dependent and calculated according to the mass density of icm at the position of the galaxy at each time step whereas @xmath2 is assumed to be constant .",

    "we include periodic boundary conditions ( at @xmath24 ) for the icm sph particles leaving the cube .",
    "we mainly described the results of 10 representative models in the present study , because these models show typical behaviours of @xmath0 evolution in disks under strong rp and intriguing parameter dependence , see table 1 for model parameter values .",
    "figure 1 shows how rp influences the time evolution of hi and @xmath0 masses and spatial distributions in a disk galaxy for five models ( m1-m5 ) . in the mass distributions of model m1",
    ", it can be seen that gas is first strongly compressed and then stripped efficiently form the galaxy . at @xmath38 gyr , just before peri - centre passage , the cold gas has clumped together with small amounts stripped .",
    "the majority of the stripping can in fact be seen at @xmath39 gyr , corresponding to the galaxy leaving the cluster central region .",
    "this indicates that the gas in the disk galaxy first undergoes compression ( a shallower decrease in hi mass ) and is then stripped ( a steeper decrease in hi mass ) .",
    "compression of the hi can enhance hi density significantly , particularly in the central region , and thus drives efficient formation of @xmath0 on dust grains in the disk galaxy . as a results , @xmath0 mass can significantly increase with a peak occurring at the peri - centre passage . @xmath0",
    "mass begins to decrease after this through stripping of gas and formation of new stars from @xmath0 .",
    "the initial decrease of @xmath0 mass at @xmath40 gyr is due to the rapid gas consumption by sf .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , rp effects on @xmath0 differ slightly for the five models ( m1-m5 ) with different disk inclination angles ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "although @xmath0 formation enhancement can be seen in all of these models , the level of this enhancement depends weakly on @xmath28 and @xmath29 . the more edge - on models ( m1 , m2 and m5 )",
    "have a higher rate of @xmath0 loss , through @xmath0 stripping and star formation ( driven by compression of @xmath0 ) .",
    "this indicates @xmath0 formation efficiency on dust grains in disks under rp depends on the inclination of the disk to the orbital plane of the galaxy .",
    "the models m1 and m5 have higher gas mass loss and rp effects on the disk galaxy than the edge - on model m2 , which is an interesting result suggesting there is a unique angle where rp has most effect . however , this is beyond the scope of this letter and we will discuss the origin of this further in future papers .",
    "figure 2 describes how the correlation between gas surface density ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath0 fraction can change with time in the disk galaxy under rp for the fiducial model m1 . in the early phase of disk galaxy evolution ( @xmath42 gyr ) , the galaxy shows a weak positive correlation between @xmath41 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 @xmath45 pc@xmath46 .",
    "there is an increase in @xmath0 gas fraction between @xmath42 gyr and @xmath38 gyr in local gaseous regions , indicating @xmath0 formation is enhanced in these local regions of the galaxy .",
    "there is little stripping of gas between @xmath42 and 1.41 gyr , as overall surface gas density does not change so significantly .",
    "stripping of gas is evident between @xmath38 gyr and @xmath39 gyr by the large drop in the overall surface gas density .",
    "these results are consistent with and reinforce what is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the move to low mean surface gas density and high @xmath0 fraction in individual gaseous regions of the disk galaxy at @xmath47 gyr is indicative of hi being stripped throughout the galaxy and not just the outer disk .",
    "the almost horizontal line of average @xmath0 fraction indicates that hi and @xmath0 are confined to the same pixels ( i.e. , the same local regions ) within the disk galaxy .",
    "figure 3 demonstrates how different galaxy orbits within clusters of galaxies and different cluster masses ( @xmath1 ) influence time evolution of hi and @xmath0 mass in disk galaxies .",
    "the peak of @xmath0 mass still corresponds to the peri - centre passages of galaxies in these models ( m6-m9 ) .",
    "model m6 has a shallower orbit than m1-m5 , due to a higher initial galactic velocity , causing less rp to influence the disk galaxy and less gas to be stripped . @xmath0 mass peaks in this model significantly shallower than models with smaller peri - centre distances ( m1-m5 ) .",
    "similarly to models m1-m5 in figure 1 , the most prominent stripping occurs as the galaxy leaves the cluster central region .",
    "model m7 , with lower @xmath1 ( group - like halo ) and an effective tighter orbit of the galaxy , produces more rapid stripping of hi ( steep slope in hi mass ) resulting in less @xmath0 formation ( low @xmath0 mass peak ) than other models ( m1-m5 ) .",
    "this is likely due to the disk galaxy spending more time in the most central region of the group where icm is higher density .",
    "contrast to this , model m8 has a wide orbit never passing the most central region of the cluster .",
    "there is little rps of hi and no peak in @xmath0 mass , as hi is not being compressed and not driving formation of @xmath0 .",
    "model m9 , with a very close orbit ( due to an initial position closer to the cluster centre ) and a lower @xmath1 ( group - like halo ) , has two peri - centre passes during @xmath482.8 gyr .",
    "hi is rapidly stripped due to the galaxy being in the cluster central region and @xmath0 is formed and stripped during the first peri - centre passage . during the second passage little increase in @xmath0 mass",
    "is seen , as there is insufficient hi to compress and form copious amounts of @xmath0 .",
    "figure 4 shows how dust growth can influence time evolution of @xmath0 and sf histories in disk galaxies under rp . @xmath0",
    "mass in the model m10 without dust physics is considerably lower with only a slight peak at the peri - centre pass .",
    "this indicates that little @xmath0 formation is occurring in the disk galaxy for this model ( m10 ) .",
    "owing to consumption of gas and dust by star formation , @xmath0 formation on dust grains can not continue to be effective without dust mass increase through accretion of gas - phase metals onto dust grains ( i.e. , dust growth ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that appreciable enhancement of galaxy - wide star formation can be seen in these two models with and without dust physics .",
    "this sf enhancement can not last long owing to @xmath0 consumption by star formation and gas stripping during and after peri - centre passage .",
    "these results imply that dust physics needs to be included in modelling of @xmath0 evolution of disk galaxies under rp .",
    "formation and evolution of h@xmath49 in galaxies is a fundamental process in understanding star formation and evolution of cold gas in disk galaxies . we have shown how formation of @xmath0 is influenced through hi compression associated with rp of a disk galaxy in the present study . as the disk galaxy undergoes rp effects @xmath0 mass in the galaxy increases , due to enhanced @xmath0 formation efficiency",
    " higher density of compressed gas can significantly enhance the conversion from hi to @xmath0 on dust grains .",
    "the present simulations does not have sub - pc resolution so that the evolution of @xmath0 in molecular clouds of disk galaxies under rps can not be investigated . using 3d mhd simulations of @xmath0 formation within molecular clouds , valdivia et al .",
    "( 2015 ) have already investigated ( i ) how @xmath0 formation in dense molecular clouds occurs rapidly and ( ii ) how @xmath0 then spreads into more defuse regions around the clouds .",
    "it is our future work to investigate how rp can influence @xmath0 formation and evolution within individual molecular clouds in disk galaxy using more sophisticated high - resolution 3d mhd simulations .",
    "the present study has shown that there exists a weak positive correlation between @xmath0 gas fraction ( @xmath43 ) and surface gas density ( @xmath41 ) in disk galaxies under rp when hi is being compressed ( yet not stripped ) .",
    "this result is consistent with observational studies for disk galaxies in the virgo cluster ( nakanishi et al .",
    "2006 ) , which have revealed a similar @xmath50 relation in ngc4254 and ngc4656 ( see figure 3 of nakanishi et al .",
    "these two galaxies are further from the cluster centre and are concluded by nakanishi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) as to have not yet been stripped of hi .",
    "the other three galaxies in their paper ( ngc4402 , ngc4569 and ngc4579 ) are stripped of hi and the gas fraction and surface density are consistent with our findings after strong rps .",
    "so far only a few observational studies have investigated a @xmath50 relation of disk galaxies in cluster environments .",
    "future observations of hi and @xmath0 of disk galaxies in clusters will allow us to discuss the possible influence of rp on @xmath0 formation and evolution in disk galaxies under rp .",
    "the present study has revealed that the evolution of @xmath0 in disk galaxies under rp depends strongly on their orbits , disk inclination angles , and cluster / group masses ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "for example , models with a more edge - on disk galaxy orientation show more efficient @xmath0 formation by compression from rp .",
    "also , in a lower dm mass cluster halo , the disk galaxy is required to have a closer orbit to the cluster centre for rp to be effective , as more time needs to be spent in higher density icm region .",
    "these results imply that sfhs of these galaxies can be significantly influenced by these parameters , because galaxy - wide sfrs can be determined by @xmath0 densities .",
    "mcpartland et al .",
    "( 2016 ) have recently discussed how a galaxy falling into a cluster at high velocities causes an extreme rps event and gives rise to the ` jellyfish ' morphology classification ( ebeling et al .",
    "2014 ) and would possibly have higher fractions of @xmath0 gas .",
    "@xmath0 formation from gaseous phase hi is unlikely to occur , as gas particles simply can not release enough energy when they encounter one another ( e.g. , gould & salpeter 1963 ; valdivia et al .",
    "the most commonly accepted solution is for @xmath0 to form on the surface of dust grains in the ism ( e.g. , gould & salpeter 1963 ; duley & williams 1993 ; le bourlot et al .",
    "2012 ) . here",
    "we have shown , for the first time , that dust growth is crucial in rapid enhancement of @xmath0 formation on dust grains in disk galaxies under rp .",
    "this implies that large - scale ( group / cluster - scale ) hydrodynamical effects can influence very small - scale physics of @xmath0 formation on dust grains .",
    "this also implies that dust evolution can control the evolution of hi and @xmath0 content of disk galaxies in groups / clusters .",
    "almost all previous galaxy - scale and cosmological - scale simulations of galaxy formation and evolution in these dense environments did not include dust physics ( e.g. , bekki 2013 ) , and accordingly their predictions on cold gas content would not be so robust .",
