    "common mechanisms of fermion mass generation in qft belong to one of the two generic types : first , the chiral symmetry is broken by the scalar field and the fermion mass is a consequence of the yukawa coupling , like in the higgs - yukawa sector of the standard model .",
    "the four - fermion theory belongs to this type through universality , though the scalar field is auxiliary in this case .",
    "second , the chiral symmetry is broken by a strong gauge interaction accompanied by confinement of the fermions acquiring mass , like in qcd or technicolor , or by a massless photon , like in the noncompact qed . no scalar field is involved .",
    "a new generic mechanism , different from the above ones , has been suggested in ref .",
    "the exemplary `` @xmath5  model '' consists of a charged fermion field @xmath1 with strong vectorlike coupling to compact u(1 ) gauge field @xmath6 , and a scalar field @xmath0 of the same charge .    in the @xmath5  model",
    ", the scalar field @xmath0 helps to solve two problems .",
    "first , it shields the fermion charge and gives rise to an unconfined , i.e. physical massive fermion @xmath7 in the phase with chiral symmetry broken dynamically by the gauge interaction ( nambu phase ) .",
    "second , the scalar _ suppresses _ this symmetry breaking and at sufficiently strong gauge coupling induces a second order transition to a chiral symmetric phase , thus opening a way to continuum .",
    "there is a particular point of the corresponding phase transition , a tricritical point , at which the model defines a new universality class .",
    "we summarize the results of our extensive systematic investigations of this model in four dimensions by means of numerical simulations with dynamical fermions .",
    "the detailed account is given in @xcite .",
    "here we discuss the particular properties of the new universality class governing the tricritical point .",
    "the model is defined by the action @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the plaquette angle .",
    "we use staggered fermions .",
    "the complex scalar field is constrained , @xmath10 . as its `` hopping parameter '' @xmath11 increases",
    ", it drives the model into the usual higgs phase .",
    "we note that there is no yukawa coupling between @xmath1 and @xmath0 , as both fields have the same charge .",
    "the phase diagram at @xmath12 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pd4d2 ] . numerical simulations have to be carried out at nonvanishing @xmath13 and an extrapolation to the chiral limit @xmath14 performed .",
    "point e is far away from any limit case and it does not appear to be accessible by any reliable analytic method , neither on the lattice nor in continuum .",
    "it is `` tricritical '' because in the full parameter space ( including @xmath15 ) there are , apart from ne , two further second order `` wing '' lines entering e from the positive and negative @xmath15 directions . the existence of a common point e of these three second order lines is neither predicted nor understood .",
    "the evidence is purely numerical , but quite strong @xcite .",
    "its position is @xmath16 .",
    "the importance of the point e roots in the experience from statistical mechanics that a tricritical point belongs to a universality class different from that of any of the second order lines entering into it .",
    "the whole ne line except the point e corresponds to the same continuum model as the point n , the njl model .",
    "the gauge field is presumably auxiliary and the model is therefore of limited interest there .",
    "however , the point e is expected to be different , gauge field playing an important role .    to verify this expectation ,",
    "we have investigated critical exponents and spectrum of the model in the vicinity of e. here we only mention the found value @xmath17 of the correlation length tricritical exponent .",
    "it differs from the prediction of the classical theory of tricritical points , indicating important role of quantum fluctuations at the point e @xcite .",
    "some insight into the physics of the continuum limit at the point e is provided by the spectrum and its scaling behavior . the massive physical fermion @xmath18 , as well as other physical states , are composite .",
    "the interaction between them is due to the van der waals remnant of the fundamental interactions .",
    "we shall attempt a possibly somewhat naive but illustrative interpretation of the found states in terms of the fundamental fields .",
    "the fermion mass @xmath19 decreases when the ne line is approached from the nambu phase .",
    "the data are consistent with expected vanishing of @xmath20 in the higgs phase in the infinite volume limit .",
    "one can consider a simple composite picture of the fermion f and of its mass : @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the mass of the scalar @xmath0 diverging at @xmath23 .",
    "the constituent mass of the @xmath1-fermion , @xmath24 , is nonzero in the nambu phase even in the chiral limit because of the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "@xmath25 is the binding energy , due to the gauge interaction between both constituents .",
    "when at fixed @xmath26 in the nambu phase the phase transition is approached by increasing @xmath11 , two things happen in ( [ f - anatomy ] ) : as @xmath0 gets lighter , @xmath22 decreases and the chiral symmetry breaking is suppressed . therefore also @xmath24 decreases . at critical @xmath11 the mass @xmath27 in ( [ f - anatomy ] ) vanishes . above the critical @xmath11 , the mass @xmath27 is zero like in the standard model with vanishing yukawa couplings .",
    "further we find in the nambu phase several @xmath28 , @xmath1 bound states .",
    "one of them is the obligatory pseudoscalar goldstone boson @xmath29 with the dependence on @xmath15 as required by current algebra .",
    "most interesting is the neutral scalar ( @xmath30-boson ) .",
    "its mass @xmath31 vanishes on the wing critical lines , i.e. at the endpoints of the higgs phase transition at small @xmath26 .",
    "it is seen appearing as a composite of @xmath32 and @xmath0 in the correlation function of the operator @xmath33 .    in the higgs phase , at large @xmath26",
    ", @xmath30-boson can be identified with the higgs boson as obtained in the unitary gauge . below the confinement - higgs phase transition ,",
    "in particular in the nambu phase , the interpretation of the @xmath30-boson is different .",
    "as the unitary gauge is no more applicable , one possibility is to see it as a @xmath34 bound state , i.e. as a `` meson '' consisting of two confined scalar `` quarks '' .",
    "but it has been observed recently @xcite that below the confinement - higgs phase transition the @xmath30-boson shows up also in the gauge - ball correlation function @xmath35 , as well as in the mixed correlation between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the amplitudes are as large as in the correlation function of @xmath36 . on the other hand ,",
    "a contribution of the @xmath30-boson to still another scalar channel , the @xmath38 one , has not been detected and is thus very small .",
    "in fact , no mass ( `` @xmath39-meson '' ) has been detected in that channel .",
    "then a scalar gauge ball is expected to be the lightest scalar in the nambu phase , because the @xmath34 bound state must get heavy when @xmath22 grows with decreasing @xmath11 .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the fact that a light scalar is seen in the correlation function @xmath37 along the whole phase boundary etc . along tc it is clearly a gauge ball .",
    "therefore we conclude that the new mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking we describe is accompanied by the presence of a scalar gauge ball in the spectrum .",
    "in the vicinity of the phase transition line ne we have determined the renormalized yukawa coupling @xmath40 between @xmath18 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is obtained from the three - point function of the corresponding composite operators and thus can be interpreted as an effective yukawa coupling , which would describe the interaction between @xmath18 and @xmath29 in the regime where their composite structure can be neglected .",
    "we have found that at a fixed fermion mass @xmath41 the yukawa coupling increases when @xmath26 decreases and the point e is approached .    in the interval @xmath42 , where the yukawa coupling is determined reliably ,",
    "we have compared our results with the curve of maximal renormalized coupling , resulting from the first order perturbative calculation in the yukawa model ( triviality bound ) .",
    "it turns out that , close to e , the data are only slightly below such a curve .",
    "therefore close to the tricritical point the @xmath5  model can be used as a microscopic model of an effective strongly coupled yukawa theory @xcite .",
    "we speculate that the suggested mechanism might be of some use for an explanation of the large top quark mass beyond the standard model .",
    "the computations have been performed at the rwth aachen and hlrz jlich .",
    "we thank hlrz jlich for hospitality .",
    "the work was supported by dfg ."
