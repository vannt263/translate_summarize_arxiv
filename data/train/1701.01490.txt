    "the variability of type 1 active galactic nuclei ( agns ) seems to be very common and can be used for investigation of the central part of an agn , especially of the broad line region ( blr ) which emits broad emission lines .",

    "this , knowing the broad line widths and the blr dimension ( from reverberation studies ) can be used for the black hole mass determination ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",

    "[ fig3 ] we plot the fluxes of h@xmath1 vs. 5100  continuum and h@xmath2 vs. 6300  continuum .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that there are good correlations between the line fluxes of h@xmath1/h@xmath2 and the corresponding continuum .",
    "the correlation coefficients in both cases are quite high ( r@xmath50.8 ) , indicating that the ionizing continuum is a good extrapolation of the optical one .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the correlation between the blue ( @xmath55100 ) and the red ( @xmath56300 ) continua is very high ( r@xmath50.94 , fig .  [ fig4 ] ) . however , the correlation between the flux of he ii @xmath04686   with the continuum 5100  and h@xmath1 is very low ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "this is probably coming from the uncertainties of the he ii flux measurements , since the line is very weak , especially in the low state of the agn activity .",
    "moreover , the he ii line is influenced with the fe ii multiplets ( see dashed line underneath the observed spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fit ] , upper right ) .",
    "higher scatter of points is seen for lower values of the he ii flux ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "also the correlations between h@xmath2 vs. h@xmath1 is slightly smaller ( r@xmath50.73 , fig.[fig4 ] ) than their correlation with the continuum .",
    "the latter may be due to the fact that , as we noted above ( section  [ sec : flux ] ) , the h@xmath2 line can be affected by very small slit position offset .",
    "we applied the zdcf and spear statistical methods to calculate the time delays of continuum and line light - curves .",
    "detailed description , examination , and comparison of these methods is given in @xcite .",
    "notice that one of the employed methods ( spear ) is also used by @xcite for the same object , but for a set of spectra observed in a much shorter period .",
    "the obtained time - delays are presented in fig .",
    "first we find time - delays using the observed data , and we obtained that zdcf gives the similar lags for h@xmath2 and h@xmath1 around 1112 days , while spear gives larger differences between h@xmath2 ( @xmath5 4 days ) and h@xmath1 ( @xmath5 17 days ) .",
    "an important result of the spear analysis is that the probabilities of the spear time - delays of both curves ( see fig .",
    "[ ccf ] , right panel ) clearly show unique peaks .",
    "this fact supports the time - lag range of 1117 days for h@xmath1 , and about 4 times shorter time - lag of h@xmath2 . from the other hand ,",
    "the zdcf and spear time - lags of the he ii @xmath04686  line are in a good agreement with each other as well as with @xcite , giving time - delays of 23 days",
    ".    since we have long - term observations covering 20 years and observational gaps , we performed gaussian process regression ( gpr ) to generate the light - curves of lines as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ lc - gp ] .",
    "we found the time - lags using both observed and generated light - curves .    from generated light - curves",
    "we obtained time delays as following : for h@xmath1 time - lag is @xmath9 days ( spear ) and @xmath10 days with cross correlation coefficient of @xmath11 ( zdcf ) , for h@xmath2 time - lag is @xmath12 days ( spear ) and @xmath13 days with cross correlation coefficient of @xmath11 ( zdcf ) , and for he ii time - lag is @xmath14 days ( spear ) and @xmath15 days with cross correlation coefficient of @xmath16 ( zdcf ) .",
    "to better assess how the time - lag between the continuum and h@xmath17 line has behaved during the monitored period , we have divided these light curves into two halves ( according to the length of the monitored period , the dividing date is jd 2453734.63 ) , and determined time - lags for each of them . for the first part we obtain the zdcf time - lag of @xmath18 days with cross correlation coefficient of @xmath19 , and the spear time - lag is @xmath20 days . for the second part",
    "the zdcf time - lag is @xmath21 with cross correlation coefficient of @xmath22 and the spear time - lag is @xmath23 .",
    "this illustrates that the time - lag for h@xmath1 remains consistent ( within the frame of the error - bars ) across the monitored period .",
    "our time - delays for the h@xmath1 and he ii lines are quite similar to the ones obtained by @xcite and , moreover they are within @xmath24 distance ( they found time delay of 1120 days for h@xmath1 and 12 days for he ii ) .",
    "however , it is interesting that the h@xmath2 line has a smaller time - lag than the h@xmath1 , and that it is closer to the time - lag of the he ii line .",
    "this is quite unusual and it seems also unphysical due to following reasons : ( i ) the h@xmath2 and h@xmath1 should come from the same emitting gas , and there can be a slight difference between the h@xmath2 and h@xmath1 lags , but as a rule the h@xmath2 lag is larger than h@xmath1 one ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however the difference should not be too large as in this case ; ( ii ) as it is shown in section 3.2.1 the h@xmath2 and h@xmath1 have practically the same fwhm and their different lags indicate that the emitting gas does not follow motion as @xmath25 , i.e. the gas virialization is not present , that is unlikely to happen .",
    "additionally , note here again , that h@xmath2 is more sensitive to the slit offset than h@xmath1 .",
    "finally , the correlation peaks for both h@xmath2 and he ii are not convincing for both used methods ( see fig .  [ ccf ] ) that have the influence on the lag uncertainties for these lines . therefore , considering the above discussion the obtained time - lags for h@xmath2 and he ii ( since we have fe ii contribution ) should be taken with caution .",
    "a very important and common variability feature in agn light - curves is red noise , which can lead to relatively dominating peaks in the power spectrum of periodograms at low frequencies .",
    "therefore , it is important to consider possible sources of noise when testing for periodicity in light - curves .",
    "although this type of flux variability is called `` red noise '' , this variability most likely arises from physical processes from the source .",
    "therefore , in our timing analysis we tested whether a purely red noise model can produce periodic variability of light - curves .",
    "for this purpose , all red noise simulations were produced by ornstein  uhlenbeck ( ou ) process ( red noise ) within the framework of gaussian process regression model @xcite .",
    "we simulated ou process with a variance of real light - curves .",
    "then we obtained random light - curves from the ou process sampled to a regular time interval .",
    "we used them to test that a periodicity of the observed light curves is the product of random variations .    for each",
    "observed and modeled light - curve we calculated lomb ",
    "scargle periodogram with a bootstrap analysis to compute its significance as it is described in @xcite .",
    "the periodogram analysis ( fig [ period ] ) ) shows that there are three possible periods of @xmath52600 , 1700 , and 1200 days present in observed data .",
    "however , in the h@xmath2 line , these peaks are not significant , while in the case of the continuum at 6300  , the peak of 1700 days is missing .",
    "perhaps this period is not relevant .",
    "moreover , these peaks are presented in random walk simulated data and their power is comparable to those in the observed data , especially in the case of the continuum at 5100  ( fig [ period ] ) . only in the case of h@xmath1 ,",
    "two smaller peaks are of grater power then those in red noise simulated data .    therefore , the possible periods are 2600 and 1200 days , but they must be interpreted with caution because similar periodicities are also prominent in the red noise simulations .",
    "thus , we propose that the detected periodicities are the product of either : i ) random variations within the object ; ii ) the sampling resolution ; iii ) some periodic process within the core of object , or iv ) a combination of all above factors .",
    "we explore the long - term photometric and spectroscopic variability of the ngc 7469 agn observed with four telescopes in a common monitoring campaign that lasted for 20 years ( from 1996 to 2015 ) .",
    "we carefully selected the observed spectra , taking into account that there may be a slit offset during the observations , in which case the contribution of the stellar circumnuclear ring can affect the continuum and line fluxes .",
    "our measurements are presented in tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab5 ] .",

    "this indicates that the broad line ratio are sensitive to the continuum flux , and therefore , the gas in the blr is most likely photoionized by the central continuum source ( accretion disc ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "there is a smaller correlation between the flux variation in the he ii @xmath04686  line and the continuum at 5100   than in balmer lines . in principle",
    "it can be caused by uncertainties in the he ii line flux measurements , since the line is very weak ( especially in the low - activity agn state ) and blended with fe ii lines .    although there is a good correlation between the h@xmath2 and h@xmath1 flux variability , the ccf analysis showed significantly different time delays , which are in principle connected with the blr dimensions .",
    "it seems that the h@xmath1 emission region is significantly larger than the h@xmath2 one .",
    "this should be taken with caution , since the h@xmath2 broad line is very sensitive to the slit offset , ( see fig .",
    "[ slit ] and discussion in section  [ sec : flux ] ) .",
    "i.e. a small slit offset of 1  has high influence to the normalized broad h@xmath2 flux , but does not significantly affect the normalized h@xmath1 flux .",
    "therefore , the lag obtained for h@xmath1 seems to be more relevant for discussion of the blr dimension of around 20 light days .",
    "the he ii has small time - lag ( 23 days ) that is smaller than h@xmath1 , which is usually detected in type 1 agns .",
    "the obtained time - lags for he ii and h@xmath1 are in a good agreement with previous measurements , as e.g. @xcite found lags of 11.8@xmath26 for h@xmath1 , and 1.9@xmath27 for he ii using the ccf , and 23.6@xmath28 for h@xmath1 , and 10.4@xmath29 for he ii using the spear method ( see table 4 in their paper ) .",
    "i.e. both methods gave that the he ii line emitting region is smaller than the h@xmath1 one , this is in agreement with the line widths , since the he ii fwhm seems to be larger than the h@xmath1 one .",
    "from this long - term monitoring of ngc 7469 , we can conclude that the geometry of the blr was not changed . as an illustration , in fig .",
    "[ mean - rms ] we compared the mean and rms h@xmath1 line profiles , rescaling the rms wing intensities to the ones of the mean profile .",
    "[ mean - rms ] shows that the broad components are the same ( there are some residuals in the centre of the rms caused by small differences in the spectral resolution ) .",
    "there is a slight red asymmetry , but there are no significant changes in the broad line profiles during the 20-year long monitoring period . from gaussian fitting , shown in fig .",
    "[ broad ] , we found that the broader gaussian ( fitting the far red wing ) is shifted for about 600 km s@xmath8 to the red .",
    "this asymmetry might be due to some kind of inflow , but taking that there is no changes in this ( red ) part of the broad line profiles during 20-year period , the inflow should be very stable or with large dimension .",
    "the results of the long - term monitoring can be used for the black hole mass estimation ( @xmath30 ) as @xmath31 @xmath32 is a factor that depends on the geometry of the blr and @xmath33 is the so called `` virial product '' or keplerian mass ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that can be calculated as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the orbital velocity at that radius ( @xmath36 ) of the blr .",
    "we found that the lag for h@xmath1 is around 20 days and for h@xmath2 around 3 days ( see section  [ sec : lag ] ) , the corresponding fwhms of these two lines are 2000 km s@xmath8 and 2100 km s@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the fwhms are measured from the broad components only ( see section  [ sec : var ] ) , then for the approximation of a spherical geometry in the blr , the orbital velocity vs. fwhm relationship can be written as ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath37 the orbital velocity from the h@xmath1 fwhm is @xmath51700 km s@xmath8 , and slightly higher for h@xmath2 , v@xmath381800 km s@xmath8 .",
    "we calculated the virial product using the following relation ( after including constants and unit transformations ) : @xmath39 \\approx 0.197\\cdot v[{\\rm km\\ s^{-1}}]\\cdot r_\\tau[{\\rm l.d . } ] ,      \\label{eq : mass_vir2}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is determined from the time delays in h@xmath2 and h@xmath1 .",
    "the obtained virial black hole mass indicators are : @xmath41 obtained from the h@xmath2 fwhm and time - lag and @xmath42 obtained from the h@xmath1 line parameters .",
    "the obtained result for h@xmath2 is in agreement with the one given in @xcite , however , the obtained mass from h@xmath1 seems to be bigger than given in @xcite .",
    "this is obviously because of our estimates of the h@xmath1 blr dimension , for which we found that is around 20 ld .",
    "however , the difference is not so big , and taking that the factor @xmath32 might have value from 1 .",
    "to 5.5 @xcite , the estimated black hole mass is around @xmath43 that is in the agreement with previously given estimates @xcite .",
    "we have presented the long - term photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign for ngc 7469 .",
    "previous spectral monitoring campaigns of this galaxy were shorter , and it is for the first time that the data of the 20-year long monitoring of this agn are presented . additionally , we present the results of the 16year period of photometric monitoring .",

    "we determined the time delays between the continuum and line flux variations , and at the end we used measured data for discussing the nature of the variability , the blr structure , and to estimate the central black hole mass in ngc 7469 .",
    "concerning our investigations of the long - term variability of ngc 7469 , we can outline the following conclusions :    * the agn of ngc 7469 is surrounded by complex circumnuclear region , that may affect the observed spectra in a monitoring campaign .",
    "our simulations show that the narrow slit observations , with relatively small offset changing ( 1 - 2 ) can produce an artificial variability in the line flux , especially in the case of the h@xmath2 line .",
    "therefore , for future monitoring campaigns one should have this in mind . * the long - term variability shows that the broad line and continuum fluxes of the agn have changed for around @xmath44 , in the continuum and h@xmath2 line , while in the h@xmath1 it changed for around 3 times .",
    "the changes in the he ii line seem to be around 6 times .",
    "we found that in the flux variability two periods around 2600 and 1200 days may be present , however these periods have to be taken with caution since red noise may be also present .",
    "we confirm that there are several short time ( 15 days ) flare - like peaks in the spectral light - curves . *",
    "the lags of the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 broad lines are quite different , showing that the h@xmath2 broad line emitting region ( similar as he ii ) is around @xmath45 light days , but h@xmath1 broad lines is coming from a region that is ten times larger ( @xmath5 20 light days ) . as we noted above , the lag for h@xmath2",
