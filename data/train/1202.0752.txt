    "the positron - production target for the ilc positron source is driven by a photon beam generated in an helical undulator placed at the end of main electron linac  @xcite .",
    "the undulator length is chosen to provide the required positron yield .",
    "the source is designed to deliver 50% overhead of positrons .",
    "therefore , the positron yield has to be 1.5 positrons per electron passing the undulator .",
    "the required active length of the undulator is about 75  meters for the nominal electron energy of 250 gev , the undulator @xmath0-value has been chosen to be 0.92 , the undulator period is 11.5 mm and a quarter - wave transformer is used as optical matching device ( omd ) .",
    "the photon first harmonic energy cutoff is 28 mev , the average energy of photons is about 29 mev and the average photon beam power is about 180 kw in a train of 2625 bunches with a frequency of 5 hz . although only relatively small fraction of total photon beam energy deposited in the target ( about  5% ) , the peak energy density deposited in target is high due to the small opening angle of the synchrotron radiation in the helical undulator resulting in a small photon spot size on the target .",
    "for example , for 500  meters space between the undulator and target , the average radius of the photon beam is approximately 2 mm and the peak energy density could achieve 120 j / g in the 0.4 radiation length thick titanium - alloy target rotated with 100  m / s tangential velocity .",
    "there is no experimental data indicating the upper limit of the peak energy density deposited by photons in the titanium alloy material with 90% of titanium , 6% of aluminium and 4% of vanadium .",
    "the analysis of the electron beam induced damage to the slc positron target @xcite and the simulations of thermal shock @xcite show that the energy deposition limit is about 30  j / g for tungsten with 25% of rhenium target irradiated by 33  gev electrons and a general criteria of failure due to an equivalent ( von - mises ) stress of 50% of tensile strength may apply to this target material @xcite .",
    "the thermal structural modeling of a rotated titanium target irradiated by helical undulator photons has been performed for the nlc by w.  stein and j.  sheppard @xcite .",
    "they recommend to consider as `` safe '' thermal stresses below one third to one half of the yield stress .    in this paper ,",
    "the thermal stress in the ilc positron source target has been estimated for the sb2009 set of parameters @xcite .",
    "the energy transfer from the photon beam into temperature of target material and the structural deformation and mechanical stress coupled with this temperature rise due to complexity of these time - dependent , cross - coupled and nonlinear processes can not be treated with the highest level of details @xcite .",
    "therefore , the choice of simulation tools and reasonable approximations and simplifications plays an important role .",
    "the energy deposition in the target has been calculated in fluka @xcite .",
    "an amount of energy is counted as deposited if after collisions the primary or secondary particles have energies lower than the energy cut - offs .",
    "the fluka default cut - offs were used : 1.511 mev  for electrons and positrons and 333  kev  for photons .",
    "figure  [ au : fig - edep - fluka ] shows the `` original '' fluka data distribution ( i.e. without any scaling factors ) of the energy deposited close to the back side of the target .",

    "the temperature distribution on the back side of the target is shown in figure  [ au : fig - temperature - backside ] .",
    "the maximal increase of temperature per bunch is about 2.2  k.        as a first step , a statical ansys model of the target material response to the heat load ( see , figures [ au : fig - edep - fluka ] and [ au : fig - temperature - backside ] ) has been applied .",
    "the total deformation and equivalent von - mises stress are shown in figs . [",

    "the maximum of equivalent stress is about 100 mpa on the back side of the target in the circular area around the photon beam axis with a radius of approx",
    "this stress is about 12% of the tensile yield strength for titanium alloy ( the properties of ti6al4v alloy , grade 5 can be found , for example , in ref .",
    "to simulate the time evolution of thermal stress in the positron source target , the target movement has been analyzed more accurately and ansys transient ( explicit ) model of deformation and stress has been used .",
    "we consider the tangential velocity of the target rim ( 1  meter in diameter ) of 100 meters per second as velocity in @xmath1 direction in a cartesian system .",
    "the energy deposited after one pulse ( 1312 bunches with 554 ns bunch separation ) as function of @xmath1 coordinate is shown in fig .",

    "the bunch overlapping factor is defined as the ratio of the maximal deposited energy after a complete bunch train with respect to the maximum after just one bunch .",
    "this factor for the nominal sb2009 source parameters is about 59 .",
    "@xmath15     figure [ au : fig - tempstress - rot ] shows the temperature and equivalent stress in the `` rotated '' target .",
    "the target has been cut in the middle plane in order to show the distributions inside the target . the static ansys model for the equivalent stress after one bunch train does not take into account thermal diffusion and",
    "thus overestimates the stress induced in the target .",
    "@xmath16     to reduce the effect of thermal diffusion on the stress and to study the time - dependent dynamic effects , another model has been used . in this model the temperature distribution after one single bunch has been scaled with the above - mentioned bunch overlapping factor .",
