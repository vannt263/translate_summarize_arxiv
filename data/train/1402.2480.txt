    "the nasa _ kepler _ mission has provided a wealth of data for studying stellar binary systems .",
    "more than 2000 eclipsing binaries have so far been found @xcite .",
    "circumbinary planets have also been discovered in several of these systems ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "the _ kepler _ eclipsing binary catalogue provides information on binaries with periods up to a few hundred days . in this paper",
    "we discuss the prospects for using asteroseismology as a novel way of discovering non - eclipsing binary systems in numbers that would potentially provide a useful statistical sample , out to periods much longer than the eclipsing binary catalogue .",
    "asteroseismology has been one of the major successes of _ kepler_. it has in particular revolutionized the study of stars that show solar - like oscillations , with detections made in several hundred cool main - sequence and subgiant stars @xcite , and over ten - thousand red giants ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "these stars present rich spectra of overtones in the frequency - power spectrum .",
    "asteroseismology may be used to discover candidate binaries by detecting the presence of two solar - like oscillation spectra in the frequency spectrum of a single _ kepler _ lightcurve .",
    "the oscillation spectra may be well separated in frequency ; or they may overlap , with the individual oscillation peaks of the two stars interspersed . to illustrate the concept , we have created an artificial example by using _ kepler _",
    "data on two red giants in the open cluster ngc6819 .",
    "we combined the lightcurves of two cluster members  kic5024405 and kic5112950  with detected oscillations ( from fig .  2 of  @xcite ) . the bottom of our fig .",
    "[ fig : combined ] shows the frequency - power spectrum of the combined lightcurve ( i.e. , the simulated asteroseismic binary ) , whilst the upper two panels show the spectra of the two original lightcurves .",
    "arrows mark the locations of the solar - like oscillations .",
    "the analysis required to discriminate the constituent oscillation frequencies of stars comprising asteroseismic binaries is beyond the intended scope of the present paper , although we add that in some scenarios  when the oscillations spectra are well separated in frequency  it is a fairly trivial matter . that would have been the case for our artificial example : the oscillations are clearly separated ( because kic5112950 is about 2.5-times more luminous than kic5024405 ) .    our aim in this paper is to estimate ",
    "subject to different assumptions about the underlying binary population  the number of binaries in the _ kepler _ field where both components would be expected to show detectable solar - like oscillations in _ kepler _ data .",
    "our results are based on predictions from two stellar population simulations of the _ kepler _ field , to which we applied target selection criteria based on those used to select the real _ kepler _ target list .",
    "we consider binaries comprised of solar - type stars and/or red giants .",
    "imposing the seismic detectability constraint for both components strongly favours binaries with mass ratio near unity .",
    "the predicted number therefore represents a very sensitive calibration of the much debated initial mass ratio distribution ( imrd ; e.g. @xcite and references therein ) near mass ratio unity .",
    "the layout of our paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : popsyn ] we discuss the population synthesis predictions made by trilegal @xcite ( section  [ sec : tri ] ) and biseps @xcite ( section  [ sec : biseps ] ) ; and target selection applied to the raw predictions ( section  [ sec : targ ] ) . in section  [ sec : det ] we explain how we used the data on the intrinsic properties of the synthetic target - selected populations to make the asteroseismic detection predictions .",
    "section  [ sec : res ] presents results on the asteroseismically detected synthetic binaries .",
    "we end in section  [ sec : disc ] with concluding remarks on the implications of our results for analysis and exploitation of the real , available _ kepler _ data .",
    "we used trilegal ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for a detailed description ) to simulate the milky way .",
    "trilegal comprises a geometric model for the principal components , e.g. , the thin and thick discs , halo and bulge , with constituent populations having a prescribed star formation rate and age - metallicity relation .",
    "the dimensions of the components were calibrated from selected real observations ( e.g. , where reddening is small and photometric incompleteness is not an issue ) .",
    "the implicit assumption is made that , aside from interstellar dust , the galactic components are smoothly distributed , and uniform in their distributions of age and metallicity .",
    "standard parameters were used for each component of the milky way .",
    "stellar populations were simulated for the fields covered by each of the 21 five - square - degree _ kepler _ ccd pairs .",
    "interstellar extinction was modelled at infinity @xcite , and assumed to arise from a dust layer having a 100-pc scale height .",
    "stellar magnitudes were estimated in the _ kepler _ bandpass using the known instrumental response function . to mimic the selection function used to compile the _ kepler _ target list ,",
    "the synthetic population was filtered using the procedure described below in section [ sec : targ ] .",
    "non - interacting binaries are included in the stellar populations simulated with trilegal . for each star",
    ", there is a probability @xmath0 that it belongs to a binary system .",
    "the secondary star has the same age and metallicity as the primary , and its mass is drawn from a flat imrd in the interval @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "default values of @xmath0 and @xmath2 are 0.3 and 0.7 , which we also adopt in our reference simulations .      the biseps code ( see * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed description ) employs the semi - analytical description for single and binary star evolution by @xcite and @xcite to create a large library of evolutionary tracks .",
    "the resulting galactic stellar population models therefore include evolving and interacting binaries in a self - consistent way .",
    "the evolutionary tracks are weighted according to initial distribution functions and convolved with a star formation history .",
    "we adopt canonical initial distribution functions for ( primary ) mass and orbital separation , while the secondary mass is selected from a power - law imrd , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the initial mass ratio and @xmath5 is a free parameter .",
    "we consider simulations computed with @xmath6 and 1 , assuming that 50% of all systems form as binaries .    to model the _ kepler _ field content we take into account contributions by the thin disc and thick disc populations , adopting hydrogen abundance @xmath7 for all stars and representative metallicities @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the extinction is calculated following @xcite , with bolometric corrections and extinction coefficients taken from @xcite .      to model the impact that the _ kepler _ target selection procedure has on the simulated binary sample we tested the synthetic _ kepler _ field against the same criteria that were used to compile the actual _ kepler _ target list from the _ kepler _ input catalogue ( kic ) .",
    "the rank - order is determined by the minimum detectable planet radius ( neglecting intrinsic stellar noise ) for observations lasting the full duration of the nominal _ kepler _ mission .",
    "the selection process involves the creation of synthetic full - frame images  which also include detector noise and zodiacal noise  to determine the optimum aperture that maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio for each target .",
    "the ranking is based on stellar parameters estimated from the synthetic colors of each target , following _ kepler _ s stellar classification program @xcite .",
    "we modelled binaries as being comprised of two point sources , with effective magnitudes calculated from the summed fluxes of the stars in the considered wavelength band .",
    "the bispes model applies a set of colour corrections to its synthetic stars to force better agreement with the actual kic in colour - colour space ; this step was not needed for the trilegal model .",
    "full details of the target selection procedure are presented in @xcite .",
    "we applied the procedure in @xcite to every simulated star in the target - selected samples to predict whether we would expect to make an asteroseismic detection .",
    "the procedure uses as input the fundamental properties of each modelled target  be it a single field star or both components of a binary  as well as the simulated _ kepler _ apparent magnitude , and the assumed duration of the observations , to estimate what would be the observed photometric signal amplitude due to solar - like oscillations , granulation and shot noise . from these estimates",
    "we may calculate the likelihood of making a robust detection of solar - like oscillations . as in @xcite , we flag a detection as made when the estimated probability of detection is higher than 90% .",
    "we corrected the predicted amplitudes of the oscillations and granulation signals of targets in binaries to allow for the dilution of the observed signal due to the presence of the companion star .",
    "these corrections were made in the _ kepler _ bandpass , using the bolometric corrections in @xcite .",
    "we adopted two different assumed observation durations , depending on the type of target .",
    "the 58.85-sec _ kepler _ short - cadence ( sc ) data are needed to detect oscillations in cool main - sequence and subgiant stars , since the dominant oscillations have periods of the order of minutes .",
    "these short periods are not accessible to the 29.4-minute long - cadence ( lc ) data ( for which the nyquist frequency is @xmath10 ) . due to the target - limited nature of the sc data ,",
    "around 2000 targets identified in the kic as solar - type stars were observed for only one month at a time during the asteroseismic survey conducted in the first 10months of science operations . to mimic this limitation of the real target sample",
    ", we therefore set the observation time to 1month for any simulated star that would require sc data to detect its oscillations .",
    "the threshold for detection in sc lies at the base of the red - giant branch .",
    "we set the observation duration to 4years for more evolved targets that would need only the lc data to detect their oscillations .",
    "[ fig : hrd ] is a hertzsprung - russell diagram showing members of the target - selected trilegal and biseps samples with predicted asteroseismic detections .",
    "results are shown from simulations in which the binary populations were given a flat imrd .",
    "grey stars ( circles ) mark cases where a detection was predicted for the more luminous component of a binary ( a single field star ) .",
    "the coloured symbols connected by solid lines mark cases where _ both _ components of a binary showed detectable solar - like oscillations .    results given by the target - selected sample from the trilegal population , having @xmath11 and @xmath12 , predict that there will be around 200 detectable asteroseismic binaries in the _ kepler _ lc data .",
    "this corresponds to just over 1% of the 20,000 red giants flagged as showing a seismic detection .",
    "most of these asteroseismic binaries will be comprised of two stars in the he - core burning , or red - clump , phase ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : histo_ev ] ) .",
    "similar results were returned by the biseps population when an imrd with exponent @xmath13 was adopted .",
    "absolute numbers drop to around 120 ( 60 ) when @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the synthetic target - selected samples include a small fraction of binaries that are either in a phase of mass transfer or have undergone such a phase in the past .",
    "none of these objects are detectable as asteroseismic binaries",
    ".    only a handful of binaries will be detectable in the main - sequence and subgiant phase .",
    "this is due both to the restrictions on the number of suitable targets with the requisite sc data ( see section  [ sec : det ] ) , and the lower observable asteroseismic signal - to - noise ratios in these stars , compared to red giants ( which makes seismic detection of binaries much harder ) .",
    "we may gain some insights on the likely robustness of the predicted _ absolute _ numbers of binary detections by comparing predicted numbers of individual detections with those already made from the _ kepler _ data .",
    "the simulations predict detections in around 1500 main - sequence and subgiant stars ( note we have compensated for the fact that the simulated target selected samples are around 20% larger than the real _ kepler _ target sample ) .",
    "the predicted number of detections is approximately a factor of two higher than the number of recorded detections @xcite .",
    "some of this difference may be attributed to the restricted number of sc target slots that were available to the real asteroseismic survey ; and the selection procedure for the asteroseismic targets ( which we have not reproduced here ) .",
    "there will also be a contribution due to stellar magnetic activity , which reduces the detectability of the solar - like oscillations @xcite .",
    "this is an effect we have not allowed for in our simulations .",
    "our conclusions for the sc data will remain the same in spite of these differences : we expect very few seismic binary detections in sc",
    ".    the impact of activity will be much less important for the more evolved cohort of stars observed in lc , where the simulations predict detections in more than 20,000 giant stars .",
    "detections have already been recorded in around 16,000 red giants .",
    "@xcite report on the asteroseismic analysis of more than 13,000 red giants ( see also @xcite ) ; whilst another 3000 detections have recently been made from the analysis of targets that were previously unclassified in the kic @xcite .",
    "there are undoubtedly other cohorts of _ kepler _ targets , containing red - giant stars , that have not yet been subjected to asteroseismic analysis ( e.g. , the so - called `` add back in '' stars at the bottom of the _ kepler _ target list ) .",
    "the absolute predictions for the lc data are therefore likely to be fairly robust , and hence the _ kepler _",
    "lc data on red giants should provide testable diagnostics of the underlying binary population , i.e. , by giving detections in numbers that are sufficient for drawing statistical inference .",
    "a crucial consideration for drawing any inferences from the real data is of course the likely occurrence rate of false - positives , i.e. , the fraction of seismically detected `` binaries '' we would actually expect to be comprised of spatially coincident  at the level of the 4arcsec pixel size of _ kepler _  but physically unassociated , single stars .",
    "the false - positive rate is limited considerably by the fact that only the 20,000 or so single stars with detectable oscillations can potentially contribute to it .",
    "we estimate that we should expect only a few false - positives ( the median expectation value is @xmath16 ) in the lc data . taking the predictions above",
    ", this translates to a false - positive rate of less than 10% of detectable asteroseismic binaries , and in some cases significantly lower depending on the properties of the underlying binary population and hence absolute numbers of expected detections .",
    "it is also worth adding that the fraction of resolvable binaries will be close to zero , i.e. , the contribution to false - negatives from resolved binaries is likely to be negligible .",
    "our simulations indicate that the mass ratios of the detectable binaries will lie close to unity ( within 10% ; see upper - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : binpars ] ) .",
    "we find this result to be largely independent of the assumed imrd .",
    "many of the detectable binaries will have he - core - burning stars , where the observed mass ratios may have been affected by mass loss and hence altered from the initial values .",
    "however , in the simulations  which use the prescription for rgb mass loss of @xcite  we find that the observed mrd of asteroseismic binaries is an excellent proxy for the initial mrd ( fig .  [",
    "fig : binpars ] , upper - left panel ) .",
    "the mass distribution of primary components in asteroseismic binaries is peaked at a higher value compared to single stars , or primary components in binaries in which oscillations can be detected in only one component ( fig .",
    "[ fig : binpars ] , upper - right panel ) .",
    "we ascribe this to the longer duration ( relative to the main - sequence ) of the core - he burning phase in higher - mass giants .",
    "most detectable seismic binaries will have oscillation spectra that overlap considerably in frequency .",
    "the observed power in the oscillations spectrum of a solar - type or red - giant star is modulated in frequency by an envelope that typically has an approximately gaussian shape . with @xmath17 denoting the frequency at which the oscillations present their strongest observed power , the fwhm of the envelope is to good approximation equal to @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : binpars ] plots the difference in the @xmath17 of the components of asteroseismic binaries ( from the trilegal simulations ) , normalized by the average of the two @xmath17 .",
    "when that fractional difference lies within @xmath19 , the peak of the oscillations spectrum of each star lies within the fwhm of its companion ; the spectra therefore overlap significantly .",
    "only when the normalized difference exceeds unity is the observable power of the two oscillations spectra all but separated in frequency .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : binpars ] shows that cases where the spectra are well separated should be rare .    the distribution of the orbital periods shown by the artificial asteroseismic binaries is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : period ] . in general",
    "it follows the distribution shown by all binaries , but displays a short - period cut - off near 40days , reflecting the need to accommodate two giant stars .",
    "we have used results from two stellar population simulations of the _ kepler _ field of view to consider potential detection yields from applying a novel asteroseismic method to discover binary systems comprised of solar - type stars and/or red giants .",
    "the method relies on the detection of the presence of two solar - like oscillation spectra in the frequency spectrum of a single _ kepler _ lightcurve .",
    "our predictions suggest that 200 or more binaries may be detectable in this manner using the _ kepler _ data .",
    "most of these binaries should be comprised of two he - core - burning red giants .",
    "owing largely to the limited numbers of targets with the requisite short - cadence _ kepler _ data , we expect only a small number of detected binaries containing solar - type stars .",
    "the method is not biased by , or dependent on , the inclination , period ( separation ) or velocities of the constituent components . as such",
    ", it may provide the only way to detect some of the binaries that are in the _ kepler _ database .",
    "the predicted yield of detections is sensitive to the imrd , which is a robust indicator of the pristine mass distribution at the epoch of star formation ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . given the additional constraints , the detection of asteroseismic binaries will also provide targets that are useful for testing stellar models and will add significantly to the list of eclipsing binaries with a solar - like oscillating component ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
