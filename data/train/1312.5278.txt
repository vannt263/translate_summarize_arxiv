    "the experimental tests of the standard model of particle physics are entering a completely new era with the first @xmath0 collisions at lhc ( cern ) in the tev energy range and the discovery of a higgs - like scalar boson @xcite .",
    "it is commonly admitted that experimental evidences showing deviations from predictions within the sm should be interpreted as signs of new physics , thereby relegating the sm to the status of an effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "we know that the renormalizable sm is at most valid up to an energy scale @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the planck mass ( @xmath3 ) , for quantum gravitational effects become relevant at that scale .",
    "however the way to treat the sm as an effective theory at a much lower energy scale of a yet unknown more fundamental theory is rather elusive and demands certain careful guidance from past experiences .    in any physical process ,",
    "the theoretical consistency requirement of the standard model demands that any characteristic intrinsic momentum , denoted by @xmath4 , which is relevant for the description of this process should be less or equal to @xmath5 . otherwise , new contributions of order @xmath6 to the lagrangian of the standard model should start to be sizeable . at tree level",
    ", this momentum can be defined for instance by any typical kinematical variables of the process , like @xmath7 in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "it is thus under complete control .",
    "however , beyond tree level , one has to deal with internal momenta in loop contributions , that may be large .",
    "how large are they really ? to answer this question , one has to enter into the renormalization procedure in order to define the physical amplitudes in terms of the bare ones calculated from the original lagrangian of the standard model .",
    "+ while physical observables should be independent of the renormalization scheme which is considered , the use of a particular scheme ( together with a regularization procedure ) may lead to unphysical interpretations when non - observable bare quantities are concerned .",
    "we shall address in this article the particular case of radiative corrections to the higgs mass .    beyond tree level ,",
    "the first radiative corrections to the higgs mass one has to consider in the standard model are radiative corrections from a @xmath8 loop as well as higgs and @xmath9 bosons loops . using a _ na \" i ve cut - off _ to regularize the bare amplitudes , these corrections immediately lead to a quadratic dependency of the regulated amplitudes on the cut - off scale @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the ( square of the ) physical mass , @xmath11 , defined at the pole of the two - body green s function , can be schematically written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the bare mass of the higgs particle , and @xmath14 is a combination of the top quark , @xmath9 bosons and higgs masses . as it is , this equation has not much physical interest .",
    "it is just a definition of the bare mass as a function of the physical mass , in the spirit of the renormalization theory .",
    "the so - called fine - tuning problem arises if one wants to give some kind of physical interpretation to the bare mass @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath10 should be much larger than any characteristic energy scale relevant for the description of the theoretical physical amplitude , a large cancellation between @xmath15 and @xmath16 should be enforced by hand - hence the name fine - tuning - unless @xmath14 is zero ( the so - called veltman condition @xcite ) , or @xmath11 is very large , which we now know is not the case .",
    "our concern in the following is twofold .",
    "we shall first illustrate the above general remarks by the explicit calculation of the radiative corrections to the higgs mass in a finite field theory based on the taylor - lagrange renormalization scheme ( tlrs ) @xcite , in leading order of perturbation theory .",
    "then we compare the results with standard procedures using a na \" i ve cut - off or dimensional regularization ( dr ) . since bphz can be recovered from tlrs , our conclusions do also apply to bphz @xcite .",
    "in addition , in analogy with dr , tlrs also contains an explicit arbitrary scale .",
    "secondly , we shall analyse our results in terms of the characteristic scale @xmath4 , and compare its value for both types , finite or infinite , of renormalization schemes",
    ". this may in turn have important consequences for the determination of the relevant momentum and/or energy scales at which new physics should show up .",
    "we stick in our study to the standard model .",
    "the discussion of how the gauge hierachy problem is formulated in tlrs when grand unified theories are concerned is beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "the plan of the article is the following .",
    "the overall settings for a consistent formulation of an eft are first discussed in sec .",
    ". then we recall in sec .",
    "[ general ] the general features of tlrs .",
    "we apply this scheme to radiative corrections to the higgs mass in the standard model in sec .",
    "[ finetune ] .",
    "we discuss our results in the light of the fine - tuning problem in sec .",
    "[ disc ] , and draw our conclusions in sec .  [ conc ] .",
    "we are familiar with the eft approach from the early days of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , where a simple example of eft valid at very low energies , @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the electron mass , is provided by the euler - heisenberg lagrangian @xcite : @xmath19 it is important to emphasize some key features from this eft analysis : _",
    "i ) _ the fundamental gauge , lorentz , charge conjugation and parity invariance severely constrain the possible forms of eft terms , _ ii ) _ the success of the full non - perturbative euler - heisenberg expression of @xmath20 is tied up to the subtraction of the ( infinite ) free - field effective action .",
    "it was further realized that the other ( logarithmically divergent ) subtraction terms can be seen as an embryonic recognition of charge renormalization . _",
    "iii ) _ in this low - energy regime , all the information of the full _ renormalized _ qed dynamics is embodied in the values of the effective couplings @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with @xmath23    the eft describes then the low - energy physics , to a given accuracy @xmath24 , in terms of a finite set of parameters .",
    "the successful ab - initio determination of these effective couplings is tied up to the renormalizibility of the full theory . to explore a domain of higher energies still in eft terms one has first to include operators of higher dimensions and then re - adjust the values of the initial effective couplings through renormalization group ( rg)-equations .",
    "the consistency of the procedure is imposed by _ matching conditions _ around the energy threshold region where physical predictions should be identical , to a given accuracy , in the full and effective theories . in this way",
    "if an energy domain shows up where the matching conditions can not be fulfilled with the desired accuracy , the problematic is twofold : either the successive addition of operators of higher dimensions is not any more feasible due to fast increasing values of the effective couplings with energy -a",
    "verifiable situation- or , more speculative , the full initial theory is itself a renormalizable eft of a deeper fundamental description of the physics reality involving new degrees of freedom in this energy domain .    obviously , since the 1940 s , the accumulation of experimental evidences in particle physics continuously supported the progression towards the sm formulation . at the same time",
    "the seminal works of euler - heisenberg heavily influenced similar successful eft developpments in non - abelian gauge field , sm and string theories , as discussed in @xcite . in this respect",
    "it is often argued that , although effective field theories contain an infinite number of terms , renormalizability is not an issue since , at a given order in the energy expansion , the low - energy theory is specified by a finite number of couplings and allows then for an order - by - order renormalization . from the works of euler - heisenberg and followers and the above discussion",
    "this is evidently not the case : an eft - sm approach can not be considered without taking into account the full renormalizibility of the underlying theory in the determination of the effective couplings even in the supposed energy threshold region for the onset of new physics .",
    "more recently the necessity for a mass - independent renormalization scheme has clearly been emphasized by a. pich @xcite : if one cuts without renormalizing loop integrals at a scale @xmath25 where new physics is supposed to become important , one obtains erroneous dependences for mass corrections which are not suppressed by powers of @xmath26 .",
    "this makes it impossible to reach converging mass contributions from higher orders of perturbation theory so that the whole approach breaks down . on the contrary , a mass independent renormalization scheme yields results where mass corrections are suppressed by powers of @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the rg scale parameter .",
    "in addition , for a gauge invariant theory like the sm , gauge invariance excludes renormalization schemes violating this invariance , e.g. all cut - off methods .",
    "we shall consider in what follows two kinds of renormalization schemes , depending on whether the renormalization of the bare amplitudes is finite or infinite .",
    "the latter is the one which is widely used in standard perturbation theory _",
    " la _ feynman .",
    "in this scheme , the choice of a regularization procedure is a necessary prerequisite to give a mathematical sense to a - priori divergent bare amplitudes . in the literature two regularization methods",
    "are mainly used : _",
    "i)_the first one exhibits a very large mass scale , denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "this mass scale is either a na \" i ve cut - off in ( euclidean ) four - momentum space , or the mass of pauli - villars ( pv ) particles in the pv regularization scheme",
    ". this explicit mass scale should be much larger then any characteristic energy , or momentum , scale relevant in the calculation of the theoretical physical amplitude .",
    "_ ii)_the second one , the so - called dimensional regularization ( dr ) procedure , amounts to extending the space - time dimension @xmath29 away from @xmath30 .",
    "the divergences of the original amplitudes show up as singularities in @xmath31 , with @xmath32 . in this case , the bare amplitudes depend on a finite , and arbitrary , mass scale @xmath28 ( the so - called `` unit of mass '' @xcite ) .    using these regularization procedures , any bare amplitude is thus made finite .",
    "however , the original divergences are recovered in the limiting process @xmath33 or @xmath34 . in this sense",
    "the renormalization schemes using these regularizations procedures are called `` infinite '' . of course",
    ", all fully renormalized amplitudes are indeed equivalently finite irrespective of the regularization method which has been used to derive them , provided the symmetries of the system are conserved .",
    "the prototype of a finite renormalization scheme is the well - known bphz procedure . in this scheme ,",
    "any bare amplitude is made finite by subtracting as many terms as necessary from the taylor expansion at zero external momenta of the integrand .",
    "all feynman integrals being convergent , no further regularization is required . in this context",
    "we shall focus on the relevance of the tlrs .",
    "this scheme originates from the well known observation that the divergences of bare amplitudes can be traced back to the violation of causality , originating from ill - defined products of distributions at the same point @xcite .",
    "the correct mathematical treatment , known since a long time , is to consider covariant fields as operator valued distribution ( opvd ) , these distributions being applied on test functions with well - defined properties @xcite .",
    "these considerations led to the development and applications of tlrs @xcite .",
    "any quantum field @xmath35 - taken here as a scalar field for simplicity - should be considered as an opvd @xcite .",
    "this has been known for a long time .",
    "however , its full significance for practical calculations was not fully recognized until recently @xcite .    as any distribution",
    ", quantum fields should be defined by their application on test functions , denoted by @xmath36 , with well identified mathematical properties @xcite .",
    "the physical field @xmath37 is thus defined by @xcite @xmath38 if we denote by @xmath39 the fourier transform of the test function , we can further write @xmath37 in terms of creation and destruction operators , leading to @xmath40,\\ ] ] with @xmath41 .    from this decomposition ,",
    "it is apparent that test functions should be attached to each fermion and boson fields .",
    "each propagator being the contraction of two fields should be proportional to @xmath42 . in order to have a dimensionless argument for @xmath39",
    ", we shall introduce an arbitrary scale @xmath25 to `` measure '' all momenta .",
    "@xmath25 can be any of the masses of the constituents . to deal with massless theories",
    ", we shall consider some a - priori arbitrary value .",
    "the final expression of any amplitude should be independent of @xmath25 .    as recalled in ref .",
    "@xcite , the test function @xmath39 should have peculiar properties .",
    "it is chosen as a super regular partition of unity ( see @xcite for more details on pu s ) , i.e. a function of finite support which is @xmath43 everywhere except at the boundaries . as a super regular test function ( srtf )",
    ", it vanishes as well as all its derivatives , at this boundaries , in the uv and in the ir domains .",
    "the boundary conditions of the test function - which in this study is assumed to depend on a one dimensional variable @xmath44 - should embody a scale invariance inherent , in the uv domain for instance , to the limit @xmath45 since in this limit @xmath46 also goes to @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is an arbitrary dimensionless scale .",
    "this can be done by considering a running boundary condition for the test function , i.e. a boundary condition which depends on the variable @xmath44 according to @xmath49 this condition defines a maximal value , @xmath50 , with @xmath51 . in ( [ running ] )",
    "is only here for later convenience ] in order to extend the test function to @xmath43 over the whole space , we shall consider a set of functions @xmath52 , denoted by @xmath53 , where by construction @xmath54 is a real positive number smaller than @xmath43 .",
    "a typical example of @xmath53 is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown that in the limit @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , the running support of the pu test function then stretches over the whole integration domain , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in this limit @xmath59 .",
    "this running condition is equivalent to having an ultra - soft cut - off @xcite , i.e. an infinitesimal drop - off of the test function in the asymptotic limit , the rate of drop - off being governed by the arbitrary scale @xmath48 .",
    "a similar scale invariance is also present in the ir domain , when @xmath60 .    with these properties ,",
    "the tlrs can be summarized as follows , first in the uv domain .",
    "starting from a general amplitude @xmath61 written for simplicity in a one dimensional space as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a singular distribution , we apply the following general lagrange formula to @xmath64 , after separating out an intrinsic scale @xmath65 from the ( running ) dynamical variable @xmath44 @xmath66.\\ ] ] this lagrange formula is valid for any order @xmath67 , with @xmath68 , since @xmath39 is chosen as a srtf .",

    "the calculation is done using a typical contribution to the self energy , namely ( [ sigc ] ) for the cut - off regularization scheme , while ( [ direct ] ) is taken for the calculation in tlrs , with an upper limit for the @xmath44 integral given by @xmath160 .",
    "note that the derivation summarized in sec .",
    "[ general ] to calculate the extension of the distribution @xmath161 in the uv domain is valid for any test function with finite support . since @xmath162 in ( [ afin ] ) is not singular anymore , all corrections from the finite support of @xmath39 in the upper limits of the integrals over @xmath44 or @xmath163 give a correction of order @xmath164 .",
    "the results indicated in fig .",
    "[ finescale ] exhibit two very different behaviors .",
    "if one considers first the calculation of the bare amplitude , the use of a na \" i ve cut - off regularization scheme does not allow to identify any characteristic momentum @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath4 is always very close to @xmath10 , all momentum scales up to @xmath10 are involved in the calculation of the bare self - energy .",
    "this is indeed a trivial consequence of the fact that the renormalization of the bare amplitude is infinite in that case .",
    "this would also be the case in any infinite renormalization scheme using dr ( in the limit of dimension @xmath30 ) .",
    "however , using tlrs , we can clearly identify a characteristic momentum @xmath4 , since it reaches a constant value for @xmath10 large enough .",
    "note also that in this renormalization scheme , we can choose a value of @xmath10 which is rather arbitrary , as soon as it is much larger than any mass or external momentum of the constituents .",
    "it can even be infinite , since it does not have any physical meaning , the only requirement being that physical amplitudes should be independent , within an accuracy @xmath24 , of the precise value of @xmath10 .",
    "this behavior is typical of finite renormalization schemes .",
    "calculated from the self - energy contribution @xmath165 defined from the condition ( [ eps ] ) , in two different schemes : with a na \" i ve cut - off ( solid line ) and using tlrs ( dashed line ) .",
    "the calculation is done for @xmath166 gev , with @xmath167 .",
    "we also show on this figure @xmath4 calculated with the fully renormalized self - energy ( [ fullr ] ) for @xmath158 ( dotted line ) and @xmath159 ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "[ finescale ] ]    if we now consider the characteristic momentum scale relevant for the description of the fully renormalized amplitude @xmath168 , we can also identify a finite value for @xmath4 since it saturates at sufficiently large values of @xmath10 compared to the typical masses and external momenta of the system .",
    "this behavior is extremely similar to the result obtained in the above analysis of the bare amplitude @xmath169 using tlrs .",
    "this is indeed not surprising since the fully renormalized amplitude is also completely finite .",
    "it depends only slightly on the external kinematical condition @xmath146 ( given here by @xmath170 ) . in any case ,",
    "the characteristic momentum scale is of the order of @xmath171 times @xmath146 , and , what is more important , it is independent of @xmath10 .",
    "one can check that @xmath168 is of course identical in all renormalization schemes .",
    "we have analyzed in this article the fine - tuning problem in the standard model of particle physics in the light of the recently proposed taylor - lagrange renormalization scheme .",
    "since this scheme leads naturally to completely finite bare amplitudes - in contrast to a na \" i ve cut - off regularization scheme which leads to quadratic divergences - the so - called fine - tuning problem can not have any physical reality in this scheme .    in order to understand in more quantitative details the differences between the various schemes",
    ", we have analysed the bare amplitudes , as well as the fully renormalized ones , in terms of the characteristic momentum scale relevant for the description of radiative corrections to the higgs mass . in the case of the bare amplitudes ,",
    "we find that this characteristic momentum scale is finite and independent of the cut - off @xmath10 , provided it is large enough , when using tlrs , while it is as large as the cut - off scale in a cut - off regularization scheme .",
    "this forcludes any physical analysis in terms of a characteristic momentum scale when one uses a na \" i ve cut - off - or using dr near four - dimensional space - time - on the bare amplitudes .",
    "the reason resides in an infinitely large bare amplitude for both regularization schemes .    on the contrary",
    ", we can clearly identify a characteristic relevant momentum scale when using tlrs .",
    "this scale is finite , while the value of @xmath10 can be very large , independently of the precise value of @xmath5 . in that case",
    "@xmath4 is completely determined by the dynamics of the underlying theory , as it should , and not by the mathematical properties of an ill - defined integral .",
    "it should only satisfy the consistency condition @xmath172 .",
    "this condition can be interpreted in two different ways . if @xmath5 is known ( top - down approach )",
    ", one should _ verify _ this condition in order to check the consistency of the effective theory . if @xmath5 is not known ( bottom - up",
    "approach ) , one should use this condition to _ induce _ a lower limit on @xmath5 , given by @xmath4 .",
    "this is the case of the standard model .",
    "as expected , the equivalence between the use of different schemes preserving gauge symmetry is restored if one analyses the fully renormalized amplitudes . in that case",
    ", one finds that the characteristic momentum scale is equivalent for all such schemes , and it is of the order of the masses , or external momenta , of the constituents of the system .",
    "a remarkable feature of tlrs is that the identification of this characteristic momentum scale in the calculation of any amplitude can be done already at the level of the bare amplitude , in four physical space - time dimensions .",
    "this is at variance with both the usual dr or cut - off regularization procedures .",
    "our analysis of radiative corrections to the higgs mass in the standard model has shown that the characteristic momentum scale is of the order of the typical mass scale given , on the mass shell , by the physical higgs mass . moreover , once the various relevant scales have been clearly identified , one can not give , on the sole consideration of radiative corrections to the higgs mass , any information on the energy / momentum scale at which new physics should show up since this characteristic momentum is independent of @xmath5 .",
    "it also does not rely on any new symmetry .",
