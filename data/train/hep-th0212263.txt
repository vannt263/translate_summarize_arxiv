    "space - like curvature singularities arising in cosmological solutions to low - energy string effective actions and their potential resolution constitute a challenging problem in string and m - theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the string resolution of certain time - like singularities , such as those arising from collapsed cycles in the internal manifold , is , at least in principle , understood . in the course of a string / m - theory phase transition , triggered by cosmological evolution of moduli fields , these singularities may , in fact , arise at a particular instance in time .",
    "for example , a flop - transition  @xcite corresponds to a collapsing two - cycle in the internal calabi - yau space while a conifold transition  @xcite corresponds to a collapsing three - cycle .",
    "clearly , such transitions are of interest for string and m - theory early universe cosmology .",
    "for example , one would like to know whether the topological transition can actually be realized dynamically , that is , whether the topology of the internal manifold could have indeed changed during the cosmological evolution .",
    "further , one would like to understand , in this cosmological context , the role of the states which become light at the transition and how precisely the transition effects the evolution of the fields .    in this paper , we will be answering these questions for the mildest form of topology change , namely the flop .",
    "a related discussion , but in the context of black - hole solutions , has been carried out in ref .",
    "we will be working in the context of m - theory on calabi - yau three - folds leading to an effective description in terms of five - dimensional @xmath0 supergravity theories  @xcite@xcite .",
    "flop - transitions arise from collapsing two - cycles within the calabi - yau manifold and are , therefore , controlled by the khler moduli which , together with @xmath1 gauge fields , are contained in five - dimensional vector multiplets .",
    "membranes wrapping calabi - yau two - cycles lead to hypermultiplet states in five dimensions with a mass proportional to the volume of the cycle .",
    "when the cycle collapses at the transition the hypermultiplet becomes massless and can no longer be ignored in the effective theory . in our analysis , we will include these hypermultiplet states explicitly into the five - dimensional effective action . in the following",
    ", we will also refer to these states as `` transition states '' . in the case of m - theory on calabi - yau three - folds , there are no non - geometrical phases  @xcite , that is , transitions are sharp .",
    "this implies that , going through the transition by first collapsing the cycle and then blowing it up in a topologically different way , leads to a another , topologically distinct calabi - yau space . while the hodge numbers of the original and the `` flopped '' calabi - yau space are the same other topological quantities , such as the intersection numbers , change across the transition .    in terms of the five - dimensional effective supergravity theory ,",
    "the transition can be described in a non - singular way once the additional hypermultiplet is included .",
    "for example , the jump in the intersection numbers which appear in the five - dimensional chern - simons term is accounted for by loop - corrections involving the hypermultiplet states  @xcite while the khler moduli space metric is continuous across the transition  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the additional hypermultiplet is charged with respect to a particular linear combination of the vector multiplet gauge fields .",
    "supersymmetry then implies the existence of a potential which depends on the transition states and the vector multiplet scalars .",
    "it is this potential which will play an important role in our cosmological analysis .",
    "practically , we will , therefore , study time - evolution in khler moduli space close to the flop region including the effect of the transition states and their potential .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will review @xmath0 supergravity in eleven and five dimensions and the five - dimensional effective action for m - theory on calabi - yau three - folds . with this machinery at hand ,",
    "we then go on to derive the effective five - dimensional action of the transition states .",
    "section 3 analyses the cosmology of the five - dimensional theory for arbitrary calabi - yau spaces , first with vanishing and then with non - vanishing transition states . in section 4 ,",
    "we focus on a specific example of two calabi - yau spaces related by a flop and study the cosmological evolution numerically .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "to set the notation , we will first review @xmath0 supergravity in eleven and five dimensions and the structure of the five - dimensional effective action for m - theory on calabi - yau three - folds .",
    "subsequently , we will show how to couple to this action the hypermultiplet which contains the transition states . the five - dimensional effective action including this hypermultiplet will be the basis for the subsequent cosmological analysis .",
    "the bosonic part of eleven - dimensional supergravity is given by  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the field strength of the three - form potential @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the 11-dimensional newton constant , as usual .",

    "this leads to a five - dimensional @xmath0 supergravity theory of the type described in the previous subsection with @xmath54 vector multiplets , @xmath55 hypermultiplets and no gauging of the hypermultiplets .",

    "we will find it usually more practical to use a single set of fields to cover the moduli spaces for both @xmath51 and @xmath79 .",
    "how does the five - dimensional effective theory change across the transition ?",
    "inspection of the action  , without gauging and potential shows that only the vector multiplet part   is affected through the change   in the intersection numbers . from eq .",
    ", the metric @xmath97 takes the specific form @xmath98 where we have used that @xmath99 .",
    "this form shows that , despite the jump   in the intersection number the metric remains continuous across the flop since @xmath100 is always multiplied by @xmath101 which vanishes at the transition .",
    "we remark that the associated connection @xmath102 which appears in the five - dimensional equations of motion contains a term proportional to @xmath26 ( without additional fields @xmath23 ) and , hence , jumps across the flop .",
    "given the continuity of the metric @xmath97 the only discontinuous term in the action is the chern - simons term in eq .   which is proportional to the intersection numbers .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite , that its jump can be accounted for by loop corrections which involve the transition states .",
    "let us now discuss these additional states in more detail .",

    "introducing a complex world - volume coordinate @xmath103 and world - time @xmath104 we consider an embedding of the membrane into 11-dimensional space of the form @xmath105 where here @xmath106 and @xmath107 are holomorphic and anti - holomorphic indices on the calabi - yau space , respectively , and @xmath108 parametrises the complex curve @xmath80 .",
    "the reduction of the membrane action on this curve leads to the following world - line action @xmath109 this particle has four transverse ( scalar ) degrees of freedom and must , hence , form a hypermultiplet in five dimensions .",

    "we assume that the associated hypermultiplet moduli space metric is flat , so that @xmath115",
    "as we will see shortly , this assumption is consistent with the above properties of the transition states and the constraints enforced by five - dimensional supergravity . to work this out explicitly ,",

    "the associated triplet of khler forms is given by @xmath120 we know that the transition states are charged under the particular combination of gauge fields  . hence the vectors @xmath39 must be proportional to @xmath121 and , at the same time , be killing vectors on flat four - dimensional space .",
    "we know that this gauging must lead to a potential of the form  . as @xmath122 this potential must vanish so that the moduli @xmath23 indeed parametrise flat directions in this limit .",
    "this implies that the killing vectors @xmath39 should not correspond to translations but rather to rotations and , hence , be of the form @xmath123 where @xmath124 is an arbitrary anti - symmetric matrix .",

    "so far , we have only used that the transition states are charged under the gauge field @xmath142 .",

    ", as it should for consistency .    in addition",
    ", we have found a potential term quartic in the transition states which was not anticipated from the membrane reduction but imposed on us by five - dimensional supergravity .",
    "this quartic term plays an important role in lifting `` unwanted '' flat directions .",
    "while the potential should be flat for vanishing transition states , @xmath144 , and arbitrary @xmath23 , a flat direction along the flop at @xmath145 and arbitrary @xmath110 would be a surprise   is broken .",

    "let us briefly summarise the discussion so far . we have seen that m - theory on a calabi - yau three - fold @xmath51 with hodge numbers @xmath52 and @xmath53 is effectively described by the five - dimensional supergravity action  , with @xmath54 vector multiplets and @xmath55 hypermultiplets and no gauging .",
    "when a flop - transition to a topologically distinct calabi - yau space @xmath79 occurs the hodge numbers and hence the number of massless particles remains the same while the structure of the five - dimensional action changes in accordance with the change   in the intersection numbers .",
    "in addition , at and near the flop - transition region another light hypermultiplet appears whose action   has to be added to the previous one for an accurate description across the transition .",
    "it is important not to confuse these transition hypermultiplet states which arises at the flop with the standard hypermultiplets associated with the complex structure moduli space of the calabi - yau space .",
    "which parts of this five - dimensional effective action are we actually interested in for our cosmological applications ?",
    "since we would like to study flop - transitions which arise by moving in the calabi - yau khler moduli space we should certainly consider the associated moduli fields , that is the vector multiplet scalars @xmath23 .",
    "clearly , we should also keep the transition states @xmath110 which become light at the flop .",
    "however , these states are charged and generically source the vector fields .",
    "hence , it seems we have to allow for non - trivial vector field backgrounds for consistency .",
    "fortunately , we can avoid such a considerable complication by setting all scalars @xmath110 equal to each other , that is , @xmath146 for all @xmath147 and a single scalar @xmath148 .",

    "we also note that , from eq .  , the potential @xmath45 is continuous while its derivatives with respect to @xmath23 contain the connection and , hence , jump . from these properties and the equations of motion",

    "it is then approximately given by @xmath192 .",
    "note , that this potential , for fixed non - zero @xmath148 has a minimum at @xmath145 , that is , precisely at the flop point . from this observation and the general shape of the potential",
    "it is intuitively clear that a generic evolution will lead to oscillations around @xmath145 and will finally settle down to this point .",
    "in other words , there is a clear preference for the system to settle down at the transition point rather than complete the transition .",
    "the complete potential   must still have a minimum at small @xmath90 for fixed non - zero @xmath148 at least as long as @xmath148 is sufficiently small .",
    "this suggests that the above argument generalises to this case and this will indeed be confirmed by our numerical integration . in conclusion",
    ", this suggest that the system behaves quite differently if we allow non - zero values of the transition states .",
    "previously , for vanishing transition states , we have found that the topology does change dynamically . if @xmath191 , on the other hand , the potential becomes important and favours the region in moduli space close to the flop transition . in this case , the system tends to settle down in the transition region so that the topology change is not completed .",
    "in this section , we would like to substantiate our previous claims by numerically studying the cosmological evolution of our system . to do this",
    "we need to consider a particular example , that is , a particular pair of calabi - yau manifolds related by a flop transition which provides us with a concrete set of intersection numbers .",
    "we will use the calabi - yau spaces described in refs .",
    "@xcite and applied to black hole physics in refs .",
    "@xcite .    concretely , we consider two elliptically fibred calabi - yau spaces @xmath51 and @xmath79 , both with a hirzebruch @xmath193 base space and with @xmath194 .",
    "these spaces share a boundary of the khler moduli space which corresponds to a flop transition . following ref .",
    "@xcite , both moduli spaces can be covered by a single set of coordinates @xmath195 with the flop transition along @xmath196 .",
    "the khler moduli space of @xmath51 corresponds to the coordinate range @xmath197 and the associated khler potential is given by @xmath198 we can use the constraint @xmath99 to solve for @xmath199 in terms of the other two moduli resulting in @xmath200 the fields @xmath23 which we have previously used are related to @xmath195 by @xmath201 this definition implies , from eq .",
    ", that the fields @xmath23 are indeed positive throughout the moduli space of @xmath51 .",
    "the flop transition is approached as @xmath202 .",
    "hence , the coefficients @xmath203 which enter the potential   are given by @xmath204 .    for the second calabi - yau space @xmath79",
    "the moduli are in the range @xmath205 and the khler potential is given by @xmath206 solving @xmath207 for @xmath199 , as before , leads to @xmath208 from eq .  , fields @xmath94 which are positive in the moduli space of @xmath79 can be defined by @xmath209 note , that the two moduli spaces   and indeed have a common boundary at @xmath210 which is where the flop transition occurs .",
    "also , using the basis @xmath23 as defined above , it is easy to see that the khler potentials   and are related by the shift   in the intersection numbers , as is required for a flop transition .",
    "we will now study the above example using @xmath211 and @xmath212 or , equivalently , @xmath101 and @xmath213 as the independent variables .",
    "it is useful to plot the potential   as a function of these variables for a fixed value of @xmath148 .",
    "this has been done in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] for a value of @xmath214 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have shown in this paper that the dynamics of m - theory flop transitions strongly depends on whether or not the transition states which become light at the flop are taken into account . if these modes are exactly set to zero the moduli space evolution proceeds freely and the topology change can indeed be dynamically realized , that is , the system moves between two topologically different calabi - yau spaces related by a flop for appropriate but generic initial conditions . for non - vanishing values of the transition modes , however , a potential becomes operative which generically stabilises moduli fields at the flop .",
    "hence , the system does not really evolve into the moduli space of the flopped calabi - yau manifold and the transition remains incomplete .",
    "one may argue that this latter case is likely since non - vanishing values of the transition states represent a more generic set of field configurations in the early universe .",
    "if this is indeed the case , the region in moduli space close to a flop is preferred by the dynamics of the system .",
    "it is likely that our results can be transferred to heterotic m - theory which provides a more realistic setting for low - energy physics from m - theory . to do this",
    ", we have to compactify the fifth dimension on a line interval and couple the five - dimensional @xmath0 bulk supergravity used in this paper to @xmath0 theories on the two boundaries  @xcite .",
    "the vacuum state of this theory is a static bps domain wall which corresponds to a certain path in the calabi - yau khler moduli space as one moves between the boundaries . using this property of the vacuum state",
    ", one can , in fact , construct static vacua of heterotic m - theory with an inherent flop transition  @xcite , that is , vacua with the flop occurring at a particular point in the interval . assuming the results of this paper indeed transfer to heterotic m - theory , it is these inherently flopped vacua which would be preferred by the dynamical evolution of the system .",
