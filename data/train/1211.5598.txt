    "in 1991 mark kasevich noticed that the phase shift of the atom interferometer is quadratically proportional to the free - fall time of the atoms @xcite , thus realizing the first gravimeter with cold atoms as test mass .",
    "the following years saw rapid progress in this type of instruments , which now approach in accuracy and even exceed in sensitivity the best corner - cube gravimeters @xcite .",
    "the atom and the corner - cube instruments measure gravity acceleration in significantly different ways , with almost non - overlapping sets of systematic effects , so bringing both types of the instruments together for comparisons is very beneficial for metrology .",
    "similar to corner - cube instruments , many systematic effects of atom gravimeters can be estimated only by modelling and computer simulation . to validate the corrections for the effects it s therefore important to compare results obtained with different models . in this paper",
    "we outline atom gravimeters from the viewpoint of the theory of linear systems . in particular , we find the impulse response functions of atom gravimeters and apply them to the analysis of the effects of the inhomogeneous gravity field .",
    "in atom gravimeters the positions of the free falling atoms are related to the phases of the light field generated by two counter - propagating lasers . in the 3-pulse gravimeters the phases",
    "@xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 of the field correspond to the positions of the atoms at the moments @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 separated by the time interval @xmath6 .",
    "the interferometer output in these gravimeters is @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the wave vector to highlight the cumulative action of two counter - propagating beams .",
    "we use simplified notation to avoid allusions to the _ effective measurement height _ @xmath9 considered further in this paper .",
    "] of the light field .",
    "the quadratic term of ( [ eq_delta_phi ] ) is caused by the doppler effect , as the accelerating atoms see the static light wave as linearly increasing frequency .",
    "the term can be cancelled by controlling the frequencies of the lasers during the free fall .",
    "the measurement of the acceleration in atom gravimeters consists in the experimental search of the frequency increase rate @xmath10 that compensates the doppler shift .",
    "the acceleration is obtained from the @xmath10 as @xcite @xmath11 the right @xmath10 makes @xmath12 equal to 0 for any @xmath6 @xcite , so from ( [ eq_delta_phi ] ) it also follows @xmath13 as @xmath14 , the same acceleration could also be found from the coordinates , if they were available @xcite : @xmath15 substituting the distances traveled by the atoms from the coordinate @xmath16 : @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the corresponding time intervals @xmath19 , @xmath20 into ( [ eq_3_points ] ) reveals the equivalence of the 3-pulse atom gravimeters with the 3-level measurement schemas ( fig.[fig_ag_schema ] ) used in some corner - cube instruments , e.g. @xcite : @xmath21 let the acceleration of atoms during the free fall change like @xmath22 .",
    "the distance relates to the acceleration via double integration , so ( [ eq_3_levels ] ) can be put as @xmath23 the above formula relates the acceleration of atoms @xmath22 to the measured acceleration @xmath24 _ linearly _ , i.e. linear combination of partial accelerations @xmath25 translates into @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the results of independent measurements of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this linearity plus the time invariance of ( [ eq_3_levels ] ) ( meaning that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are pre - defined for a drop ) enables treatment of atom gravimeter as linear time - invariant ( lti ) system .",
    "in such a system @xcite the input and the output signals are connected by the _",
    "operation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the _ impulse response function _ of the system . applied to absolute gravimeters , the convolution enables presenting the measurement result in the form @xmath35 i.e. as the acceleration of the atoms weighted over the measurement interval .",
    "here we have @xmath36 and @xmath37 , as the measured gravity is attributed to the end of the measurement interval .",
    "therefore , the gravimeter s weighting function is its impulse response function turned backwards with respect to the end of the measurement interval .",
    "the impulse response can be found as reaction of the system on the dirac delta function @xmath38 @xcite . as ( [ eq_g_via_integrals ] )",
    "has two double integrators , we first find the reaction of a double integrator on @xmath38 .",
    "the first integral of @xmath38 is the heaviside step function @xmath39 , the second integral is the unit ramp function @xmath40 ( fig.[fig_ag_genesis ] ) : @xmath41    the equivalence of the double integration to the convolution with the unit ramp ( [ eq_unit_ramp ] ) follows from the integration by parts rule @xmath42_0^t-\\int_{0}^{t } v \\ , { \\mathrm{d}}u $ ] : @xmath43_0^t - \\int_{0}^{t}t \\ , g(t ) \\,{\\mathrm{d}}t = \\int_{0}^{t}g(t)(t - t ) \\ , { \\mathrm{d}}t .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] two ramp functions combined according to the formula ( [ eq_g_via_integrals ] ) yield the the gravimeter s weighting function by acceleration @xmath44 : @xmath45 some systematic effects are more convenient to analyze in terms of the atoms velocity or displacement rather than acceleration . applying again integration by parts to ( [ eq_g_via_wf ] ) , we get @xmath46_0^{2t}-\\int_{0}^{2 t } \\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}w_g(t)}{{\\mathrm{d}}t}\\int g(t){\\mathrm{d}}t { \\mathrm{d}}t .   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath47 , and the velocity @xmath48 , the above expression simplifies to @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the weighting function by velocity is known in atom interferometry as _ sensitivity function _ @xcite . ] .",
    "the weighting function by displacement can be found likewise , leading to @xmath51 these functions are shown on the fig.[fig_ag_wfs]a .",
    "the following properties hold true @xmath52 explaining why the constant acceleration translates unchanged into the result , while the constant velocity or displacement yield no measured gravity .",
    "if the atoms acceleration changes during the free fall like @xmath53 the additional component caused by the term @xmath54 can be found as @xmath55 where @xmath44 is the weighting function of the gravimeter by acceleration . if the disturbance is expressed in terms of velocity or displacement , the additional component can be found using the corresponding weighting functions @xmath56 or @xmath57 as @xmath58 @xmath59 it s interesting to observe that the formulas ( [ eq_dz_meas ] ) and ( [ eq_3_points ] ) are alike , as the gravimeter s weighting function by displacement is just the dirac comb sampling the continuously changing coordinate in three points .",
    "if the disturbance is expanded like @xmath60 its influence on the measured gravity , according to ( [ eq_g_via_wf ] ) , can be found as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the @xmath63-th moment of the @xmath44 : @xmath64 similar formulas can be derived also for @xmath65 and @xmath57 .",
    "we consider two realizations of atom gravimeters . in the _ fountain _ gravimeters",
    "the measurement takes place on both upward and downward parts of the trajectory , each part has the duration of @xmath6 ( fig.[fig_ag_schema]a ) . in the _ release _ gravimeters the measurement takes place only on the downward part of the trajectory during the time interval @xmath66 ( fig.[fig_ag_schema]b ) .    for both types we put the coordinate origin in the atoms resting position and co - direct @xmath67-axis with the atoms initial velocity .",
    "the measurement in both cases starts at the moment @xmath3 when separation from the origin is @xmath16 and the initial velocity is @xmath68 . the constant gradient changes gravity with height like @xmath69 from here on , the upper sign in the @xmath70 or @xmath71 symbols correspond to the release gravimeters , while the lower sign corresponds to the fountain gravimeters . in the time domain",
    "the ( [ eq_g_z ] ) is @xmath72 which according to ( [ eq_dg_via_cn ] ) and ( [ eq_cn ] ) translates into the following measured gravity : @xmath73 this agrees with the result obtained also in @xcite . at the _ effective measurement height _",
    "@xmath9 the measured gravity equals actual gravity : @xmath74 comparison of ( [ eq_g_z_meas ] ) and ( [ eq_g_z_t ] ) leads to the conclusion that the effective measurement height of atom gravimeters is @xmath75 for the release gravimeters , let @xmath76 be the length of the idle part of the trajectory , and @xmath77 be the total trajectory length .",
    "obviously , @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "as @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , we get @xmath84 for the fountain gravimeters , the initial velocity @xmath68 equals @xmath85 , as the atoms reach the apex in time @xmath6 .",
    "the total trajectory height @xmath86 leads to the following location of @xmath9 above the initial position : @xmath87 as the gravity at the apex of the trajectory is @xmath88 , the same point is at the following distance below the apex : @xmath89 the gravity at the effective measurement height corresponds to the measurement with no vertical gradient correction .",
    "at some gravimetric sites the vertical gravity gradient varies significantly over the free - fall trajectory and can not be considered a constant . the linear gradient @xmath90 changes gravity like @xmath91 unlike the constant gradient , the parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 depend on the coordinate system used to analyze the correction . expressing ( [ eq_g_z_lin_grad ] ) in terms of time gives us @xmath94 where @xmath95 applying the moments ( [ eq_cn ] ) to ( [ g_g2_expanded ] ) we obtain the effect of the linear gravity gradient as @xmath96      the self - attraction of absolute gravimeter can produce a complex - shaped disturbance , for which the approximations by low - degree polynomials , like in the previous examples , are not sufficient .",
    "the figure [ fig_sa ] shows the self - attraction of the atom gravimeter @xcite along the atoms trajectory and its approximation by the 6-th degree polynomial .        to evaluate the effect of this disturbance we used moments @xmath62 up to the @xmath63=12 . the calculated effect for the inital velocity @xmath68=0.25 ms@xmath97 was @xmath981.27 @xmath99gal , which agrees with the result obtained in @xcite by another method",
    "the uncertainty introduced by the approximation can be estimated with formula ( [ eq_g_via_wf ] ) by treating the residuals @xmath100 ( fig.[fig_sa ] ) as disturbance : @xmath101 the result holds true for any type of absolute gravimeter : _ the uncertainty of the correction caused by the approximation of the gravity disturbance does not exceed the maximum error of the approximation . _ in our case ( fig.[fig_sa ] ) the approximation led to the error of less than 0.05 @xmath99gal . for atom gravimeters the approximation can be performed so that the correction uncertainty would not exceed @xmath102 .",
    "the detailed analysis of this issue is out of the scope of the present publication and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "in this type of gravimeters @xcite the atoms are thrown up vertically and travel to the apex of the trajectory during the time @xmath6 , where they hover for the time @xmath103 tossed by the bloch oscillations , and then drop back to the original position .",
    "the formula ( [ eq_3_phases ] ) for this instrument becomes @xcite @xmath104.\\ ] ] as per section [ lti ] , this gravimeter can be modeled by three double integrators with integration times of @xmath6 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "impulse response functions of this gravimeter are shown on the fig.[fig_ag_wfs]b .",
    "as @xmath107 , the gravimeter performs near - uniform averaging of the atoms acceleration .",
    "the instrument described in @xcite has the trajectory length of only 0.8 mm , so the corrections for the constant and the linear gravity gradients are minuscule , and the correction for the self - attraction can be taken as the disturbance in any point of the trajectory taken with the opposite sign .",
    "the gravimeter s frequency response is fourier transform of its impulse response function @xcite . due to its almost - uniform impulse response , the atom gravimeter with bloch oscillations is equivalent to the first - order low - pass filter . by comparison ( fig.[fig_fr ] ) ,",
    "the 3-pulse atom gravimeter is equivalent to the second order , while the corner - cube gravimeter is equivalent to the third - order low - pass filter @xcite ( fig.[fig_fr ] ) .",
    "these characteristics follow from the gravimeters logic in translating the input gravity to the measurement result and do not include any additional vibration shielding that instruments may possess .",
    "we analyzed atom gravimeters as lti systems , found their impulse response functions and applied them to evaluation of certain disturbances .",
    "the following conclusions sum up the analysis .    1 .",
    "atom gravimeters are equivalent to non - multi - level corner - cube gravimeters in translating the gravity signal into the measurement result .",
    "weighting function of atom gravimeter by acceleration can be determined as impulse response of the lti system consisting of several double integrators .",
    "the acceleration , velocity , and displacement weighting functions are successive derivatives changing sign on every succession .",
    "3 .   the effect of a disturbance on atom gravimeter can be found by replacing the time powers in the disturbance expansion with corresponding moments of the weighting function .",
    "the effective measurement height of atom gravimeters is located below the apex of the trajectory on 1/6 of its total length for the fountain , and on about 7/24 ditto for the release type gravimeters .",
    "error in the analysis of a disturbance arising from the disturbance approximation does not exceed the maximum error of the approximation .",
    "6 .   with respect to the vibration disturbances",
    "the atom gravimeter with bloch oscillations is equivalent to the first - order low - pass filter , while the 3-pulse atom gravimeter is equivalent to the second order low - pass filter ."
