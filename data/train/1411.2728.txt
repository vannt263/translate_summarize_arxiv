    "the research field of microfluidics investigated the possibilities that microhydrodynamics offers to perform chemistry or biology on a micrometric scale .",
    "such efforts have led to an increasing number of lab - on - a - chip applications in the last ten years  @xcite .",
    "in this course droplet microfluidics has emerged  @xcite , because it exploits the laminar flow in microchannels to precisely control and steer operation on droplets , which act as highly parallelizable reaction chambers .",
    "microfluidic length scales are in the order of tens to hundreds of micrometers . when microfluidic channels are filled with two immiscible liquids , for instance water and oil , the viscosities are in the order of @xmath0 and surface tension or interfacial tension in the order of @xmath1 , depending on the fluid mixture and surfactants . due to the small length scale",
    "the flow resistance in these channels is high , which is one reason why flow rates usually range between a few @xmath2 to hundreds of @xmath3 with flow rates in the order of @xmath4 .",
    "the reynolds number , re@xmath5 , is small and therefore , it is often a reasonable approximation to discard the non - linear inertial terms and to consider stokes flow , which is described in section  [ mathmodel ] .",
    "however , when considering two - phase flow even in the stokes regime , the dynamics become non - linear due to the free interface between both liquids . the non - linearity stems from domains of different viscosity separated by a mobile interface under surface tension .",
    "two competing effects dominate the dynamics ; one comes from viscous shear and the other from surface tension .",
    "the capillary number expresses the balance between viscosity and surface tension : @xmath6 , which is considered here to be between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    throughout the article we consider shallow channels that lie in a common plane . instead of trying to resolve the full three - dimensional problem , we solve a depth - averaged problem , which is two - dimensional . for shallow channels the velocity profile in the thin direction ( z - axis )",
    "is assumed to be parabolic , a hypothesis that is also used to derive darcy s law in two - dimensions ( x - y plane ) .",
    "darcy s law states that the flow velocity @xmath9 is given by the pressure gradient divided by viscosity @xmath10 and a permeability coefficient @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "although there have been propositions to account for tangential surface stresses in darcy s law  @xcite , the inability to impose tangential stresses and velocities renders this approach incomplete .    in this work",
    "we propose the use of the brinkman equations instead , which include a correction to the darcy s law in form of the depth - averaged in - plane laplacian , a reminiscence of the @xmath13  stokes equation . for droplet flows the brinkman equation was to our knowledge first proposed by boos _",

    "@xcite and bush  @xcite , who treated the flow induced by a thermo - capillary effect .",
    "the brinkman equation is solved with a boundary element method ( bem ) , which eliminates one more dimension turning the problem from a @xmath13  differential equation into an integral equation on a @xmath14  line .",
    "while bem approaches have been followed for @xmath15  stokes flows  @xcite , for @xmath13  stokes flow  @xcite and darcy  flow  @xcite , recall that simulations of @xmath13  stokes flow can not account for the confinement in the z - direction whereas darcy s law becomes invalid close to boundaries and interfaces .",
    "the use of the brinkman equation requires high aspect ratios to justify depth - averaging but we will see that it might still accurately captures the dynamics for aspect ratios approaching @xmath16 .",
    "close to boundaries or interfaces the brinkman equation gives much better results than darcy s law , because it captures depth averaged boundary layers even if the averaged equations become inconsistent @xcite .",

    "<S> in the following work we apply the boundary element method to two - phase flows in shallow microchannels , where one phase is dispersed and does not wet the channel walls . </S>",
    "<S> these kinds of flows are often encountered in microfluidic lab - on - a - chip devices and characterized by low reynolds and low capillary numbers .    assuming that these channels are homogeneous in height and have a large aspect ratio </S>",
    "<S> , we use depth - averaged equations to describe these two - phase flows using the brinkman equation , which constitutes a refinement of darcy s law . </S>",
    "<S> these partial differential equations are discretized and solved numerically using the boundary element method , where a stabilization scheme is applied to the surface tension terms , allowing for a less restrictive time step at low capillary numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence of the numerical algorithm is checked against a static analytical solution and on a dynamic test case . </S>",
    "<S> finally the algorithm is applied to the non - linear development of the saffman - taylor instability and compared to experimental studies of droplet deformation in expanding flows . </S>"
