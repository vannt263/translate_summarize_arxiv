    "velocity correlations at different steps can be neglected and the integral over the time interval @xmath4 $ ] can be replaced with the sum of integrals over disjoint steps . if variations of step durations and velocity fluctuations can be neglected as well , we arrive at the standard random walk consisting of steps that take the same fixed time .",
    "the distance covered during single step is fixed but the direction of the step is random .",
    "it can be , for example , a step along one of the basis vectors when random walk is performed on a @xmath1dimensional lattice or it can be a step in a completely random direction in @xmath1dimensional space as in the case of isotropic walk . in many situations",
    "though the variation of the step s duration and velocity can not be disregarded .",
    "a famous example is lvy walks ( lws ) @xcite that belong to a more general class of stochastic processes called continuous time random walks ( ctrws )  @xcite . in ctrws",
    "it is not only the direction of the displacement during one step that is random ( as in the standard random walk ) but also the length of the step and the time that it takes .",
    "this flexibility allows to cover a large number of real - life situations including dynamics of an ordinary gas molecule when both the time between consecutive collisions and velocity of the molecule vary . in ideal gas",
    "the probability of large ( much larger than the mean free time ) time between the collisions is negligibly small so the probability density function ( pdf ) of the step duration decays fast for large arguments .",
    "this is not the case for the so - called lorentz billiard @xcite , in which the particle moves freely between collisions with scatterers arranged in a spatially periodic array . in the case without horizon ,",

    "the two limiting distributions describe the bulk and the tails of @xmath12 .",
    "both distributions are sensitive to the microscopic statistics of the velocity of walkers and are model specific .",
    "we consider a random walk in @xmath13 with a pdf @xmath14 of the single step velocity that obeys @xmath15 , cf",

    "a stronger , large deviation limit tells that @xmath18 where the convex function @xmath19 is known as large deviations , or entropy , or rate , or kramer s function @xcite ; see @xcite for simple derivation .",
    "this limit describes exponential decay of the probability of large deviations of finite - time value @xmath20 from its infinite time limit fixed by the law of large numbers , @xmath21 .",
    "it corresponds to the boltzmann formula and tells that the pdf of macroscopic thermodynamic variable ( representable as the sum of large number of independent random variables ) is exponential of the entropy whose maximum s location gives the average .",
    "the coefficients of the quadratic expansion near the maximum characterize thermodynamic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "thus in the case of finite dispersion there is one universal scaling with the limiting distribution ( the special case of finite dispersion but power - law tail , @xmath22 , produces different limiting distribution @xcite ; we do not consider this case here ) .",
    "there are two different scalings that were found in the case of one - dimensional super - diffusive lws @xcite .",

    "is imprinted into the statistics of the displacement  no matter how large the observation time @xmath11 is ; see the discussion of the particular case of @xmath29 in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the language of field theory ,",
    "ordinary random walks are _ renormalizable _ : in the long - time limit the information on macroscopic structure of the walks is reduced to finite number of constants @xcite .",
    "thus the gaussian pdf of the sum of large number of i. i. d. random variables is fully determined by the mean and the dispersion of those variables and their total number .",
    "the rest of the information on the statistics of these variables is irrelevant  when the gaussian bulk of the pdf is addressed .",
    "in contrast , the entropy function of the large deviations theory is the legendre transform of the logarithm of the characteristic function of the random variable in the sum .",
    "thus large deviations description is sensitive to the details of statistics of one step of the walk .",
    "we conclude that the gaussian bulk of the pdf of the sum of large number of i. i. d. random variables with finite dispersion is determined by a finite number of constants characterizing the statistics of the single step but the tail of the pdf is not .    in this work",
    "we show that the pdf of a @xmath30 - dimensional lw is not universal and can not be specified with a finite number of constants  already in the bulk  if the statistics of the velocity of single steps , given by the pdf @xmath14 , is anisotropic .",
    "to stress this fact we call the corresponding distributions described by eq .",
    "( [ g0 ] ) anisotropic lvy distributions. in contrast , if the velocity statistics is isotropic , for example , @xmath14 is given by the uniform distribution on the surface of the @xmath30-dimensional sphere of the radius @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "1a ) , the description of the process can be reduced to one - dimensional case and the bulk of the corresponding pdf is fully determined by a finite number of constants which can be calculated from @xmath14 .",
    "thus in the anisotropic case there is a dramatic difference between the bulk of the pdfs of a lw and the random walk with finite dispersion of the single step duration .",
    "we demonstrate that besides the limiting distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ g0 ] ) there is another limiting distribution which is determined by @xmath32 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the effective velocity of the particle , @xmath34 and the limit exists because the tail of the pdf is determined by ballistic - type events .",
    "this distribution is called infinite density where the word infinite refers to the non - normalizable character of this function found previously in one - dimensional case @xcite .",
    "this pointwise limit holds for @xmath35 non - contradicting normalization of the pdf : in this limiting procedure the normalization is carried by @xmath36 point .",
    "the existence of the other scaling limit is unique property that has origins in the scale - invariance of the tail of distribution of @xmath5 .",
    "this distribution describes the tail of the pdf of the particle s coordinate . in this sense",
    "it is the counterpart of the large deviations result for ordinary random walk given by eq .",
    "( [ largedeviations ] ) .",
    "there is however significant difference : the large deviations function describes averages of high - order moments but in the case of lvy walks the infinite density provides already dispersion of the process .",
    "this can be seen observing that as we demonstrate the distribution provided by eq .",
    "( [ g0 ] ) has power - law tail with divergent second moment .",
    "this is because for lvy walks rare events when the walker performs extremely long ballistic flights have a substantial impact on the total displacement of the walker even in the limit of long times .",
    "the probability of long ballistic steps is not negligibly small and single ballistic steps could be discerned in a single trajectory of the walker for any time @xmath11 .",
    "such steps form the outer regions of the pdf .",
    "thus the two limit distributions describe the bulk and the tail of the lw s pdf , respectively .",
    "the bulk is formed by the accumulation of typical ( most probable ) steps .",
    "they are responsible for a diffusive motion ( albeit already anomalous one ) .",
    "in contrast , the pdf s tails are formed by long ballistic flights and they are described by the infinite density .",
    "these flights are rare steps where the walker moves for a long ( i. e. , comparable to the total observation time @xmath11 ) time without changing its velocity . in the case of the lorentz billiard",
    "this is the situation when the velocity vector of the particle aligns close to the direction of one of the ballistic corridors @xcite .",
    "though this happens relatively rarely , the distance covered by the walker during a such flight is so large that these flights give _ finite _ contribution to the probability that the walker displacement after the time @xmath11 is of the order @xmath37 .",
    "when the probability of long flights is , for example , exponentially small ( as in the case of the standard random walks ) the contribution of the flights can be neglected .",
    "this is not , however , the case of the lws with power - law asymptotic of @xmath38 , as we demonstrate in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ form ]",
    "we introduce the basic definitions and the tool of the study - the fourier - laplace transform of the pdf of the walker s coordinate . in the next section we provide complete solution for the case of isotropic statistics of velocity of the walker .",
    "central result of our work - the anisotropic clt for the bulk of the pdf is derived in section [ clt ] .",
    "the next section describes universality of the tail of this non - universal bulk that helps finding low moments of the distance from the origin .",
    "section [ infn ] provides the other limiting theorem on infinite density that provides the tail of the distribution .",
    "the next section provides detailed form of the moments of arbitrary order including anomaly in growth due to anisotropy . in section [ frct ]",
    "we provide the tail of the pdf and conclusions resume our work .",
    "in this section we specify the considered random process and introduce the main tool of the analysis on which all further results rest . this is the fourier ( in space ) - laplace transform ( in time ) of @xmath9 .",
    "we consider a lw as an infinite sequence of flights ( steps ) of random duration @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the flight s index in the chronologically ordered sequence .",
    "the process starts at time @xmath41 at the point @xmath42 .",
    "the velocity of the walker during a flight is a random vector @xmath43 which remains constant during the flight . upon the completion of the flight both the velocity @xmath44 and the duration @xmath45 of the next flight",
    "are randomly chosen , by using pdfs @xmath14 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the number of flights performed during the observation time @xmath11 , @xmath46 , is a random number constrained by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is so - called the backward recurrence time @xcite .",
    "the time @xmath11 coordinate of the particle is , @xmath49 the simplest model is @xmath1dimensional lvy plotter , the product of @xmath30 independent one - dimensional walks along the basis vectors which span @xmath13 .",
    "the pdf of this process is the product of the corresponding one - dimensional pdfs @xcite .",

    "@xmath14 is specified by the uniform distribution on the surface of @xmath1dimensional unit sphere so velocity has fixed magnitude @xmath24 ; see fig .",

    "we demonstrate in the following sections that different statistics enter the pdf @xmath9 through the moments @xmath57 .",
