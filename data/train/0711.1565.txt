    "information transmission over channels with known interference at the transmitter has recently found applications in various communication problems such as digital watermarking @xcite and broadcast schemes @xcite .",
    "a remarkable result on such channels was obtained by costa , who showed that the capacity of the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel with additive gaussian i.i.d .",
    "interference where the sequence of interference symbols is known non - causally at the transmitter is the same as the capacity of the awgn channel @xcite .",
    "therefore , the gaussian interference does not incur any loss in the capacity .",
    "this result was extended to arbitrary ( random or deterministic ) interference in @xcite by using a precoding scheme based on multi - dimensional lattice quantization .",
    "following costa s  writing on dirty paper \" famous title @xcite , coding for the channel with non -",
    "causally known interference at the transmitter is referred to as  dirty paper coding \" ( dpc ) . by analogy ,",
    "coding for the channel with causally - known interference at the transmitter is sometimes referred to as  dirty tape coding \" ( dtc ) . the result obtained by costa",
    "does not hold for the case that the sequence of interference symbols is known causally at the transmitter .",
    "recently , dirty paper coding has emerged as a building block in multiuser communication . in particular , there has been considerable research studying the application of dirty paper coding to broadcast over multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channels . in such systems , for a given user , the signals sent to other users are considered as interference . since all signals are known to the transmitter , successive  dirty paper \" cancelation can be used in transmission after some linear preprocessing @xcite .",
    "it was shown that dpc in fact achieves the sum capacity of the mimo broadcast channel @xcite .",
    "most recently , it has been shown that the same is true for the entire capacity region of the mimo broadcast channel @xcite .",
    "these developments motivate finding realizable dirty paper coding techniques . building upon @xcite , erez and ten brink @xcite",
    "proposed a practical code design based on vector quantization via trellis shaping and using powerful channel codes .",
    "due to the complexity of implementation , their scheme uses the knowledge of interference up to six future symbols rather than the whole interference sequence .",
    "@xcite gave another design based on superposition coding and successive cancelation decoding .",
    "their design uses a trellis coded quantizer with memory length nine and a low density parity check ( ldpc ) code as channel code .",
    "wei yu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite gave a design based on convolutional shaping and channel codes .",
    "the schemes that use the interference sequence up to the current symbol can be used as low - complexity solutions for the dirty paper problem .",
    "for example , in @xcite , scalar lattice quantization is proposed for data - hiding even though in that context , the host signal in clearly known non - causally .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the problem of channel code design for the @xmath0-ary input awgn channel with additive causally - known discrete interference .",
    "the discrete interference model is more appropriate for many practical applications .",
    "for example , in the mimo broadcast channel where the transmitter uses a finite constellation , the interference caused by other users is discrete rather than continuous .",
    "our design does not rely on the suboptimal ( in terms of capacity ) precoding scheme based on scalar lattice quantization for the dirty tape channel @xcite , @xcite .",
    "instead , we consider a _",
    "approach based on code design for the shannon s _ associated _ channel over all possible input symbols .",
    "another distinction between our work and the related research in the field is that we consider a finite channel input alphabet rather than a continuous one .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we summarize shannon s work on channels with causal side information at the transmitter . in section [ chanmodel ]",
    ", we introduce the channel model . in section [ code ]",
    ", we derive the code design criterion for the awgn channel with causally - known discrete interference at the encoder . in section [ binary ]",
    ", we consider channels with binary input for which we show that the design criterion derived in section [ code ] reduces to maximizing the hamming distance . in section [ mary ]",
    ", we consider a special case for which the result for the binary channel also holds for the @xmath0-ary channel . in section [ general ] ,",
    "we consider a more general channel model for which the main results of this work hold .",
    "we conclude this paper in section [ conclude ] .",
    "channels with known interference at the transmitter are special case of channels with side information at the transmitter which were considered by shannon @xcite in the causal knowledge setting and by gelfand and pinsker @xcite in the non - causal knowledge setting .",
    "shannon considered a discrete memoryless channel ( dmc ) whose transition matrix depends on the channel state .",
    "a state - dependent discrete memoryless channel ( sd - dmc ) is defined by a finite input alphabet @xmath4 , a finite output alphabet @xmath5 , and transition probabilities @xmath6 , where the state @xmath7 takes on values in a finite alphabet @xmath8 .",
    "the block diagram of a state - dependent channel with state information at the encoder is shown in fig . [ j2-fig1 ] .",
    "in the causal knowledge setting , the encoder maps a message @xmath9 into @xmath10 as @xmath11    shannon showed that it is sufficient to consider the coding schemes that use only the current state symbol in the encoding process to achieve the capacity of an sd - dmc with i.i.d .",
    "state sequence known causally at the encoder @xcite .",
    "the sd - dmc can be used in the way shown in fig .",
    "[ j2-fig2 ] to transmit information .",
    "a precoder is added in front of the sd - dmc .",
    "a message @xmath9 is mapped into @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a new alphabet .",
    "the output of the precoder ranges over @xmath4 and depends on the current interference symbol .",
    "the regular ( without state ) channel from @xmath14 to @xmath15 is defined by the transition probabilities @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the probability of the state @xmath7 .",
    "the dmc defined in ( [ nostate ] ) is called the _ associated _ channel . the codes for the _ associated _ channel describe the codes for the sd - dmc that use only the current state symbols in the encoding operation . in order to describe all coding schemes for the sd - dmc that use only the current state symbol in the encoding process , @xmath13 must include all functions from the state alphabet to the input alphabet of the state - dependent channel .",
    "there are a total of @xmath18 denotes the cardinality of a set .",
    "any of the functions can be represented by a @xmath19-tuple @xmath20 composed of elements of @xmath4 , implying that the value of the function at state @xmath21 is @xmath22 .",
    "we consider data transmission over the channel @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the channel input , which takes on values in a real finite set @xmath4 , @xmath15 is the channel output , @xmath25 is additive white gaussian noise with power @xmath26 , and the interference @xmath27 is a discrete random variable that takes on values in a real finite set @xmath8 . the sequence of i.i.d .",
    "interference symbols is known causally at the encoder .",
    "the above channel can be considered as a special case of the state - dependent channel considered by shannon with one exception , that the channel output alphabet is continuous . in our case ,",
    "the likelihood function @xmath28 is used instead of the transition probabilities .",
    "we denote the input to the _ associated _ channel by @xmath14 , which can be considered as a function from @xmath8 to @xmath4 .",
    "we denote the cardinality of @xmath4 and @xmath8 by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "then the cardinality of @xmath13 will be @xmath29 , which is the number all functions from @xmath8 to @xmath4 .",
    "the likelihood function for the _ associated _ channel is given by @xmath30 where @xmath17 is the probability of the interference symbol @xmath7 and @xmath31 denotes the pdf of the gaussian noise @xmath25 .",
    "although in this work , we consider a fixed channel input alphabet @xmath4 , the transmitted power is not fixed in general .",
    "in fact , for probability distribution @xmath17 on @xmath8 and for a given coding scheme for the _ associated _ channel which induces probability distribution @xmath32 on the symbols of @xmath13 , the transmitted power is given by @xmath33 & = & \\sum_{t \\in { \\mathcal{t } } } \\sum_{s \\in { \\mathcal{s } } } p(t ) p(s ) e[x^2|t , s ] \\\\ & = & \\sum_{t \\in { \\mathcal{t } } } \\sum_{s \\in { \\mathcal{s } } } p(t ) p(s ) t^2(s).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , in general , the transmitted power depends on the probability distribution on the interference alphabet .",
    "the binary - input channel with @xmath34 is an exception , however , for which we have @xmath35 for all @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , for any coding scheme and any probability distribution on the interference alphabet , the transmitted power is equal to @xmath37 .    in this work",
    ", we do not impose any constraint on the power of the transmitted signal .",
    "however , in the performance comparisons given in sections [ binary ] and [ mary ] for different scenarios , we ensure that the transmitted power is the same in all scenarios .",
    "any coding scheme for the _ associated _ channel defined by ( [ assoc ] ) translates to a coding scheme for the actual channel defined by @xmath28 .",
    "we use the pairwise error probability ( pep ) approach to derive the code design criterion at high snr . since in this work , we consider fixed channel input and interference alphabets , the high snr scenario is realized by making the noise power @xmath26 sufficiently small .",
    "this is equivalent to scale up the transmitted signal and the interference by the same factor for a given noise power .",
    "suppose that the messages @xmath38 and @xmath39 are encoded into codewords @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 belong to the alphabet @xmath13 , @xmath44 . in the absence of noise , transmission of the codeword @xmath45",
    "can result in many different received sequences at the channel output depending on the interference sequence @xmath46 . in specific , all sequences in @xmath47 represent the transmitted codeword @xmath45 at the channel output .",
    "on the other hand , all sequences in @xmath48 represent the codeword @xmath49 . using maximum likelihood decoding , the probability of the event that message @xmath39 is decoded given message @xmath38 was sent is given by @xmath50 in appendix [ app1 ]",
    ", we have shown that the above error probability at high snr is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( stands for side information ) , the distance between two input symbols of the _ associated _ channel @xmath54 and @xmath55 , is defined as @xmath56 ) .",
    "in order to see how the knowledge of interference at the encoder can result in larger distances between codewords , consider the channel model introduced in section [ chanmodel ] with the exception that the interference sequence is not known at the encoder . in this case , the discrete interference is considered as noise . in order to obtain the pep for this channel , suppose that messages @xmath57 and @xmath58 are encoded into @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "similarly , it can be shown that the pep at high snr is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 , the distance between two symbols @xmath63 and @xmath64 of @xmath4 is defined as @xmath65 comparing ( [ distance ] ) and ( [ dis ] ) , it becomes clear that larger distances among codewords are possible for the channel with side information at the encoder .",
    "in fact , the distance @xmath62 is equal to @xmath53 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "however , @xmath13 has many other symbols , which may yield larger distances .",
    "for example , consider the channel with @xmath68 .",
    "for the case without side information at the encoder , we can compute the distances between symbols of @xmath4 according to ( [ dis ] ) as @xmath69 .",
    "hence , according to ( [ critnosi ] ) , it is impossible to transmit data over this channel with low error probability even at high snr . for the case with side information at the encoder , the four symbols of the _ associated _ channel can be represented as @xmath70 . using ( [ distance ] ) ,",
    "it is easy to check that the distances between all pairs of the symbols are zero except for @xmath71 which is @xmath72 . as will be seen in section [ binary ] , @xmath73 and @xmath74",
    "can be used in the encoding to achieve arbitrarily low error probabilities as snr increases .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the distance measures defined in ( [ distance ] ) or ( [ dis ] ) do not satisfy the triangle inequality .",
    "for example , again consider the channel with @xmath68 .",
    "the distances between all pairs of the input symbols of the _ associated _ channel are zero except for @xmath71 which is @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the triangle inequality does not hold for @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath71 .",
    "we call the channel introduced in ( [ chmodel ] ) a _ binary channel _ when the channel accepts binary input , i.e. , @xmath2",
    ". there is no constraints on the cardinality of the interference alphabet . for the binary channel ,",
    "the size of @xmath13 is @xmath3 .",
    "however , we may not need to use all the symbols of the alphabet in the encoding . in this section , we show that it is sufficient to use only two symbols of @xmath13 in the encoding as far as the distance spectrum of the code is concerned .",
    "we begin with the following lemma for the binary channel .",
    "[ lem1 ] for the binary channel , there exist at least two symbols in @xmath13 with nonzero distance .",
    "we may explicitly denote the channel input and interference alphabets by @xmath77 and @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 . from the definition of distance in ( [ distance ] ) , it is sufficient to show that there exist two elements @xmath54 and @xmath55 in @xmath13 such that the corresponding multi - sets is a multi - set of size four where @xmath81 has multiplicity two . ] ( of size @xmath1 ) @xmath82 and @xmath83 are disjoint .",
    "we prove this by induction on @xmath1 .",
    "the statement of the lemma holds for @xmath84 since we may take @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "then the sets @xmath87 and @xmath88 are disjoint .",
    "now suppose that the statement of the lemma is true for some @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the exist two @xmath1-tuples composed of elements of @xmath4 ( two input symbols of the _ associated _ channel ) such that the corresponding multi - sets are disjoint .",
    "we prove that the statement of the lemma hold for @xmath89 .",
    "the element @xmath90 is larger than any element of the two multi - sets ( of size @xmath1 ) .",
    "hence , it does not belong to any of the multi - sets . if @xmath91 does not belong to any of the multi - sets too",
    ", then we can include the new elements @xmath91 and @xmath90 in the multi - sets of size @xmath1 arbitrarily ( one elements in each multi - set ) .",
    "the resulting multi - sets of size @xmath89 will be disjoint . if @xmath91 belongs to one of the multi - set of size @xmath1 , we include it in that multi - set and include @xmath90 in the other multi - set to form the new disjoint multi - sets of size @xmath89 .",
    "the two @xmath92-tuples ( the two input symbols of the _ associated _ channel ) are then obtained from the two multi - sets of size @xmath89 by subtracting the interference symbols from their elements .",
    "lemma [ lem1 ] is in fact a special case of theorem 2 in @xcite , which was stated in the context of capacity .",
    "let @xmath73 and @xmath74 be two input symbols of the _ associated _ channel with the maximum distance among all pairs of input symbols of the _ associated _ channel . since @xmath93 ( according to lemma [ lem1 ] ) , we have @xmath94 , otherwise , from ( [ distance ] ) , @xmath95 .",
    "we choose an arbitrary interference symbol @xmath36 to partition @xmath13 as follows .",
    "we put @xmath96 in @xmath97 if @xmath98 , otherwise ( i.e. , @xmath99 ) we put @xmath54 in @xmath100 . note that the distance between any two symbols in @xmath101 is zero , @xmath102 .",
    "suppose that a codebook is designed for the binary channel with codewords composed of elements of @xmath13 .",
    "we construct a new codebook from the original one by replacing the elements of the codewords that belong to @xmath97 by @xmath73 and replacing the elements of the codewords that belong to @xmath100 by @xmath74 .",
    "since the codewords of the new codebook are composed of just two elements , we may call the new code a binary code .",
    "[ theo1 ] the distance spectrum of the binary code constructed by the procedure described above is at least as good as the distance spectrum of the original code .",
    "consider any two codewords @xmath103 and @xmath104 from the original codebook , where @xmath105 .",
    "the squared distance between the two codewords is equal to @xmath106 . for any @xmath107 , we consider two cases :    _ case 1 _ : @xmath42 and @xmath43 belong to the same partition .",
    "then @xmath108 , so the replacement will not change the distance .",
    "_ case 2 _ : @xmath42 and @xmath43 belong to different partitions . then since @xmath109 , the replacement will not decrease the distance .    according to theorem [ theo1 ] ,",
    "as far as the distance spectrum of the code in concerned , it is sufficient to use two symbols of @xmath13 with the maximum distance , namely @xmath73 and @xmath74 , in the encoding for a binary channel . since @xmath13 has size @xmath3 for the binary channel , a brute - force search for finding two symbols in @xmath13 with the maximum distance will have exponential complexity with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "we have proposed an algorithm with polynomial complexity for finding two symbols with the maximum distance in appendix [ app2 ] .",
    "since it is sufficient to use @xmath73 and @xmath74 in the encoding for the binary channel , we can define the hamming distance between any two codewords , which is the number of positions at which the two codewords are different .",
    "consider two codewords @xmath110 and @xmath111 with elements from the binary set @xmath112 .",
    "the squared distance between these codewords is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the hamming distance between @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , the problem of designing codes for the binary channel where the interference sequence is known causally at the encoder reduces to the design of codes for the binary symmetric channel .",
    "the only difference is that the coding is over the set @xmath112 rather than @xmath117 .",
    "if we were to use a binary code for the interference - free binary channel with the input alphabet @xmath118 , then the euclidean distance between any two codewords @xmath115 and @xmath116 of length @xmath119 for the interference - free channel would be @xmath120 where @xmath121 denotes the euclidean distance .",
    "using ( [ d_si ] ) and ( [ d_e ] ) , we can compare the performance of a zero - one binary code for the binary channel with causal side information at the encoder with the same zero - one binary code for the interference - free binary channel . in the case of channel with side information , zero and one",
    "are mapped to @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and in the case of the interference - free channel , zero and one are mapped to @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath73 and @xmath74 are functions from the interference alphabet @xmath8 to the channel input alphabet @xmath118 .",
    "it is clear from ( [ distance ] ) that @xmath124 therefore , using ( [ d_si ] ) and ( [ d_e ] ) , the distance spectrum of the code for the interference - free channel is at least as good as the distance - spectrum of the code for the channel with known interference at the encoder .",
    "of course , this is not surprising .",
    "however , it is interesting to search for the conditions that ( [ ineq ] ) is satisfied with equality .",
    "if ( [ ineq ] ) is satisfied with equality , the distance spectrum of the two codes will be the same .",
    "in other words , if ( [ ineq ] ) is satisfied with equality , the knowledge of interference at the encoder enables us to achieve the same performance ( in terms of order of probability of error ) as the interference - free case at high snr .",

    "the error probability curve for the scenario that the interference is not known at the encoder , is plotted for comparison . in this scenario ,",
    "the error probability curve reaches an error floor of @xmath150 .",

    "in general , the statement of theorem [ theo1 ] is not extendable to the case with @xmath155 channel input symbols .",

    "therefore , the same symbol enters the channel regardless of the current interference symbol .",
    "this suggests that the knowledge of interference symbols at the encoder is not helpful in terms of distance spectrum improvement provided that the condition of theorem [ theo3 ] is satisfied .",
    "in fact , with the condition of theorem [ theo3 ] , we have @xmath174 where @xmath175 , defined in ( [ dis ] ) , is the distance measure when the interference is not known at the encoder and @xmath176 is the euclidean distance measure .",
