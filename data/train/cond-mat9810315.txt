    "fragmentation , _ i.e. _ the breaking of particulate materials into smaller pieces is a ubiquitous process that underlies many natural phenomena and industrial processes .",
    "the length scales involved in it range from the collisional evolution of asteroids through the scale of geological phenomena down to the breakup of heavy nuclei @xcite . in most of the realizations of fragmentation processes the energy is imparted to the system by impact , _",
    "i.e. _ typical experimental situations are shooting a projectile into a solid block , free fall impact with a massive plate and collision of particles of the same size @xcite .",
    "the most striking observation about fragmentation is that the size distribution of fragments shows power law behavior independent on the microscopic interactions and on the relevant length scales , _",
    "e.g. _ the charge distribution of small nuclei resulted from collisions of heavy ions exhibits the same power law behavior as the size distribution of asteroids @xcite .",
    "experiments revealed that the power law behavior of fragment sizes is valid for a broad interval of the imparted energy @xcite , which was also reproduced by computer simulation of sophisticated microscopic models @xcite .",
    "the observation of power law size distributions without control parameter initiated the idea of self - organized criticality @xcite in fragmentation and gave rise to numerous studies to understand the dynamic origin of the power law @xcite .",
    "hence , during the past years much information has been accumulated about fragmentation processes in the imparted energy range where a power law size distribution occurs but the limiting case of low energies is still not explored .    beside the general interest in fragmentation processes one can also mention other fields where fracture and fragmentation of solid particles due to impact play an important role .",
    "it is well known that in the flow of granular materials a large part of the kinetic energy of the grains is dissipated in the vicinity of their contact zone during the collisions . beside the viscous and plastic effects ,",
    "the dissipation by damaging is also an important source of energy loss in the flow .",
    "collision of particles occurs also in the solar system in planetary rings . in this case",
    "the energy dissipation due to impact damage might also influence the large scale structure formation in the rings @xcite . on larger length scale in the solar system , the so - called collisional evolution of asteroids due to subsequent collisions , and",
    "the formation of rubble piles in the asteroid belt is still a challenging problem @xcite . among industrial applications",
    "the breakup of agglomerates in chemical processes can be mentioned .",
    "due to experimental difficulties , the computer simulation of microscopic models is an indispensable tool in the study of these impact phenomena @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we want to elaborate the impact fracture and fragmentation of solids at low imparted energy using a two - dimensional dynamical model of breakable granular solids . simulating collisions of two solid discs",
    "we show that , depending on the imparted energy , the outcome of a collision process can be classified into two states : a damaged and a fragmented state with a sharp transition in between . analyzing the energetics of the impact and the resulted fragment size distributions we give numerical evidence that the transition point between the damaged and fragmented states behaves as a critical point .",
    "the transition proved to be the lower bound for the occurrence of power law size distributions .",
    "the possible mechanism of the transition between the two states is discussed . in spite of the specific features of the system studied here ,",
    "most of our results can be considered generally valid for impact phenomena mentioned above .    after giving a short summary of the main ingredients of our model in sec .",
    ", the numerical results concerning to the energetics of the collision process and to the size distribution of fragments will be presented in secs .",
    "iii .  and iv .",
    ", respectively . in sec .",
    "v.  we discuss the possible mechanism of the transition and some general consequences of our work for other types of fragmentation phenomena .",
    "recently , we have worked out a two - dimensional dynamical model of deformable , breakable granular solids , which enables us to perform molecular dynamics simulation of fracture and fragmentation of solids in various experimental situations @xcite .",
    "our model is an extension of those models which are used to study the behavior of granular materials applying randomly shaped convex polygons to describe grains @xcite . to capture the elastic behavior of solids we connect the unbreakable , undeformable polygons ( grains ) by elastic beams .",
    "the beams , modeling cohesive forces between grains , can be broken according to a physical breaking rule , which takes into account the stretching and bending of the connections .",
    "the breaking rule contains two parameters @xmath0 controlling the relative importance of the stretching and bending breaking modes , respectively .",
    "the energy stored in a beam just before breaking is released in the breakage giving rise to energy dissipation .",
    "the average value of the energy dissipated by the breakup of one contact defines the crack surface energy @xmath1 in the model solid as a function of the breaking parameters @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . at the broken beams along the surface of the polygons cracks",
    "are generated inside the solid and as a result of the successive beam breaking the solid falls apart .",
    "the fragments are defined as sets of polygons connected by remaining intact beams . in the framework of this discrete model one",
    "can introduce the notion of the binding energy @xmath4 as the energy released in the case of complete disintegration , _",
    "i.e. _ in the case when all the fragments are single polygons",
    ". hence , @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the total number of grain - grain contacts in the solid .",
    "note that @xmath4 is proportional to the volume of the sample and can be considered as a natural energy scale of the system .",
    "the time evolution of the fragmenting solid is obtained by solving the equations of motion of the individual polygons until the entire system relaxes , _",
    "i.e. _ there is no breaking of the beams during some hundreds consecutive time steps and there is no energy stored in deformation . for more details of the model s definition",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have applied the model to study shock fragmentation of solids in various experimental situations .",
    "namely , simulations were performed to study the fragmentation of a solid disc caused by an explosion in the middle @xcite , the breaking of a rectangular block due to the impact with a projectile @xcite , and the collision of two macroscopic bodies ( discs ) @xcite .",
    "the model proved to be successful in reproducing the experimentally observed subtleties of fragmenting systems , _",
    "e.g. _ the power law mass distribution of fragments was found independent on the initial conditions , with an exponent in the vicinity of two , slightly depending on the initial energy @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we apply our model to explore the properties of impact fragmentation processes at low imparted energy . for this purpose we carried out molecular dynamics simulation of the collision of two solid discs of the same size , similar to ref .",
    "the disc - shaped granular solid was obtained starting from the voronoi - tessellation of a square @xcite and cutting out a circular window in the middle .",
    "this way of construction gives rise to a certain surface roughness of the particles .",
    "the schematic representation of the collision of two particles is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . for simplicity , in the present studies only central collisions were considered , _",
    "i.e. _ the value of the impact parameter @xmath7 was set to zero in all the simulations , and only the size of the particles @xmath8 and the surface energy @xmath1 were varied . in the simulations the energy - release by beam breaking is the only possible source of dissipation .",
    "the energy of the collision @xmath9 is defined as the total initial kinetic energy of the colliding bodies @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the mass density and @xmath12 denotes the initial velocity of the particles .",
    "when @xmath9 is smaller than the so - called damage threshold @xmath13 , the collision results simply in elastic rebound without internal damage ( without breaking of beams ) . to achieve damaging , @xmath9 has to surpass the damage threshold @xmath13 , which is determined by the surface energy @xmath1 of the model .",
    "it is generally accepted that impact fragmentation phenomena exhibit so - called energy scaling , _",
    "i.e. _ the result of the fragmentation process only depends on the value of the specific energy defined as the imparted energy divided by the total mass of the system . to characterize the collision events we introduce a dimensionless parameter @xmath14 with the definition @xmath15 this choice of parameter @xmath14 has the advantage with respect to the specific energy that besides the dependence on the global size it includes also the specific material type through the surface energy @xmath1 . since in the present study we focus on the evolution of damage with increasing impact energy ,",
    "simulations were performed at fixed values of @xmath8 and @xmath1 varying @xmath14 in the range @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 corresponds to the damage threshold @xmath18 .",
    "our results concerning to impact fragmentation at @xmath19 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite including detailed analysis of the dynamics of the collision process and comparison to experiments .",
    "the values of the most important parameters of the present simulations are summarized in table [ table_0 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] we present the final breaking scenarios ( relaxed states ) of the collision process obtained by simulations at four different values of @xmath14 .",
    "it can be observed that for @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "@xmath21 ) cracking by beam breaking mainly occurs in the vicinity of the contact surface of the two bodies and the bulk remains practically intact .",
    "since this gentle collision does not cause size reduction of the two particles , this case can be considered as an inelastic impact of discs , where energy dissipation is solely due to internal damage . increasing the impact energy @xmath9 , _",
    "i.e. _ increasing @xmath14 , gives rise to more broken beams in fig .",
    "@xmath22 and the solids break into pieces . around the impact site of the bodies the fragments are smaller ( single polygons , some pairs and triplets ) , and there are a few much larger fragments the size of which is still comparable to the original size of the bodies",
    ". further increase of @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "@xmath23 mainly results in breakup of the large fragments into smaller ones giving rise to fragmentation of the entire solids .",
    "based on the above qualitative picture , we classify the outcome of a collision into two states , _",
    "i.e. _ _ damaged _ and _ fragmented _ states distinguished by the size of the largest remaining piece .",
    "the colliding bodies are considered to be _ damaged _ when the size of the largest piece is comparable to the original size of the bodies ( see fig .",
    "@xmath24 , while the _ fragmented _ state is characterized by the absence of such large pieces ( fig.@xmath23 . in the following we point out that the above qualitative picture is also supported by the quantitative analyzis of the energetics of the collision process and of the behaviour of the resulting size distribution of fragments .",
    "namely , evaluating the energy released by the breaking of beams , and quantities related to the size distribution of fragments we will justify that the behaviour of the colliding system has two different regimes with a sharp transition in between .",
    "the energetics of the collision process corresponding to the samples of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] is summarized on figs .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , and [ fig : fig4 ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows the energy @xmath25 released by beam breaking , together with the remaining kinetic energy @xmath26 stored in the motion of fragments as a function of @xmath14 . for the purpose of comparison ,",
    "the surface energy @xmath1 of the model , the binding energy of the sample @xmath4 and the energy of the impact @xmath9 are also plotted in the figure .",
    "when the impact energy @xmath9 surpasses the damage threshold @xmath13 ( @xmath14 surpasses @xmath17 ) the released energy @xmath25 takes its smallest value , which is equal to the surface energy @xmath1 of the model ( only one beam is broken ) .",
    "the largest possible value of @xmath25 is equal to the binding energy of the sample @xmath4 , which can only be reached in the case of complete disintegration . according to the simulations ,",
    "this limiting case is hard to achieve , since on the surface of the colliding discs opposite to the impact site , small fragments comprising a few polygons can always escape .",
    "it can also be seen in the figure that the impact energy @xmath9 producing complete disintegration has to be much larger than the binding energy @xmath4 .",
    "note that similar qualitative behaviour was found simulating free fall impact of a disc with a massive plate @xcite .    the most interesting observation of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] is that the curve of @xmath25 versus  @xmath14 is composed of two distinct parts , _",
    "i.e. _ a rapidly increasing low energy part , and a slowly increasing high energy part .",
    "these two regimes are separated by a point where @xmath25 is practically equal to the remaining kinetic energy @xmath26 , which implies that at this point half of the total kinetic energy @xmath9 is released by cracking .",
    "the two regimes can be better observed in fig.[fig : fig4 ] where the ratio @xmath27 of @xmath25 and @xmath9 is plotted against @xmath14 .",
    "the curve of @xmath27 has a maximum , the value of which is in the vicinity of 0.5 .",
    "this maximum separates a rapidly increasing and a slowly decreasing part , which we associate to the damaged and fragmented regimes introduced above , respectively .",
    "we identify the transition point between the two states with the position of the maximum called _ fragmentation threshold _ @xmath28 .",
    "the separation of the two regimes and the identification of the transition point is also supported by the behaviour of the mass of the largest fragment as a function of @xmath14 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] we present the sum of the mass of the largest fragments of the two bodies @xmath29 normalized by the total mass @xmath30 versus  @xmath14 .",
    "the monotonically decreasing function has a distinct curvature change , the position of which @xmath31 coincides with the maximum of the energy release curve @xmath27 .",
    "this also confirms that the behaviour of the system sharply changes at a specific value of @xmath14 that we called fragmentation threshold @xmath28 .    to clarify the influence of the overall size of the colliding bodies on the behaviour of the fragmenting system",
    ", simulations were performed varying the radius @xmath8 of the particles between 10 and 30 cm .",
    "note that the average size of the randomly shaped unbreakable polygons is 1 cm .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] shows @xmath27 as a function of @xmath14 for several values of @xmath8 .",
    "it can be observed that the qualitative behaviour of the curves is universal , it is independent on the system size , but the position of the transition point @xmath28 is slighly shifted downward with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "to reveal the nature of the transition from the damaged to the fragmented state , the evolution of the fragment size distribution with varying impact energy is a crucial point .",
    "since the dissipated energy @xmath25 is proportional to the total surface of cracks it is expected that the two regimes should clearly show up also in the type of disintegration of the solids , _",
    "i.e. _ in the behaviour of the size distribution of fragments . in the present chapter",
    "we demonstrate that in the vicinity of @xmath28 the behaviour of the fragment size distribution shows strong similarities to that of the size distribution of clusters in systems undergoing second order phase transition . as an example",
    ", one can mention the behaviour of the cluster size distribution in percolation around the critical point @xmath32 , or the size distribution of droplets in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath33 in the case of the liquid - gas phase transition . throughout this chapter",
    "we refer to percolation on finite lattices for the purpose of comparison .",
    "the fragment mass histograms @xmath34 corresponding to the colliding system of the preceding chapter are shown in figs.@xmath35 for several values of @xmath14 below and above the transition point @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath34 denotes the number of fragments with mass @xmath36 divided by the total number of fragments , averaged over 10 collision events having the same @xmath14 . in order to obtain the same statistics of the distribution at all sizes",
    "a logarithmic bining was used , _",
    "i.e. _ the bining is equidistant on logarithmic scale .",
    "the histograms have two cutoffs .",
    "the lower one is due to the existence of single unbreakable polygons while the upper one is determined by the finite size of the bodies .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] we have shown that a collision at @xmath14 just above @xmath17 results in only a few small fragments and two big ones ( with almost the same size ) but no fragments are generated in the intermediate mass region .",
    "hence , in fig .",
    "@xmath37 the corresponding mass distribution @xmath34 has two peaks at small and at large mass with a large gap in between .",
    "increasing @xmath14 in fig .",
    "@xmath38 , the main difference compared to fig .",
    "@xmath37 is that the peak of the large fragments gradually disappears , the large pieces break into smaller ones giving rise to fragments in the intermediate mass region . for @xmath39",
    "the mass distribution @xmath34 in the intermediate region tends to a power law : @xmath40 the value of the exponent obtained at @xmath41 is @xmath42 .",
    "our former simulations showed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the power law behavior of @xmath34 remains valid for @xmath43 , but the value of the exponent @xmath44 is a decreasing function of @xmath14 , in agreement with most of the experimental observations @xcite .    to clarify the effect of the overall size of the colliding bodies @xmath8 on the shape of the mass distribution @xmath34 and on the value of the exponent @xmath44 , in fig.[fig : fig8 ] we plotted the fragment size distributions at the transition point @xmath28 for three different values of @xmath8 .",
    "it can be seen that increasing @xmath8 the power law region of @xmath45 gets wider and the relative height of the hump at large fragments decreases , but the value of the exponent @xmath44 does not change .",

    "it can be observed in table [ table_1 ] that the numerical values of the exponents obtained by starting from the three possible pairs agree well with each other within the error bars , which gives further justification of our phase transition picture .",
    "in the present paper we applied our dynamical model of granular solids to study impact fragmentation phenomena at low values of the imparted energy . analyzing the energetics of the fragmentation process and the resulting size distribution of fragments we identified two distinct final states of the impact process , _ i.e. _ _ damaged _ and _ fragmented _ states with a sharp transition in between . with a detailed study of the behavior of the fragment mass distribution in the vicinity of the transition point and its dependence on the finite particle size we gave numerical evidence that the transition point behaves as a critical point and the _ damage - fragmentation _",
    "transition occurs as a continuous phase transition .",
    "the control parameter of the transition was chosen to be the dimensionless ratio @xmath14 of the energy of impact and the binding energy of the sample , and the order parameter was associated to the mass of the largest fragment divided by the total mass .    based on the time evolution of the collision process obtained by the simulations , the following qualitative picture of the mechanism of the transition can be established : when two macroscopic solids collide damage first occurs in the surroundings of the contact zone of the bodies .",
    "after this contact damage a compressive elastic pulse expands radially through the bodies the amplitude of which strongly depends on the amount of primary damage occurred in the contact zone .",
    "the pulse reflects back from the free boundary and after reflection tensile forces arise in the solids resulting in cracks in the bulk .",
    "the amount of breaking in the bulk is mainly determined by the amplitude of the initial pulse remaining after contact damage .",
    "the fragmentation of the colliding solids occurs above a specific value of the impact energy where the amplitude of the remaining pulse will be sufficient to give rise to the complete break up of the bulk into pieces . at this specific energy value",
    "the behavior of the colliding system sharply changes as we demonstrated by analyzing the energetics and the size distribution of fragments .",
    "the idea of the existence of a so - called fragmentation phase transition was first addressed in the field of nuclear physics where the fragmentation of heavy nuclei due to impact is extensively studied ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . using percolation based ideas",
    "it was shown that the disassembly of excited nuclei possesses a continuous phase transition when the imparted energy is varied @xcite .",
    "the order parameter of the transition was associated to the size ( charge ) of the largest fragment .",
    "recently , the penetration of a steel ball into a solid plate with varying impact energy was studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "it was reported that the so - called ballistic limit , _",
    "i.e. _ the impact energy where the perforation of the plate occurs , behaves as a critical point , and the perforation occurs as a continuous phase transition the order parameter of which was chosen to be the mass of ejecta expelled from behind the target .",
    "it was argued that the mechanism of the phase transition is the coalescence and percolation of randomly nucleated microcracks .    in the analysis of the numerical results obtained by the computer simulation of our dynamical model",
    ", we referred to the theory of percolation on finite lattices just as an example of critical phenomena occurring in finite systems , without assuming percolation of microcracks . in this sense",
    "our analysis is free of model assumptions . in the snapshots of the final scenarios of collision",
    "processes it can be seen that the complicated elastic field arising due to propagation and interference of elastic waves gives rise to correlated crack growth .",
    "hence , in our case the assumption of percolation of cracks can not be valid , and the values of the exponents obtained numerically are different from the corresponding exponents of percolation .",
    "an important feature of our model which can affect the result of a fragmentation process is the existence of elementary , non - breakable polygons , which hinders us from observing fragmentation on lower scales .",
    "in ref.@xcite , using a discrete model of solids similar to ours , detailed tests of the effect of the polygon size on the shape of the mass distribution of fragments in impact fragmentation were performed .",
    "it was found that if the tessellation of a solid is fine enough to reproduce the macroscopic elastic behavior correctly , the effect of the existence of unbreakable polygons on the size distribution of fragments occurs solely in the vicinity of the cutoff size , and the overall shape of the distribution is not affected .",
    "this also implies that the phase transition behavior revealed by our simulations is not influenced globally by the element size , but it can be expected that the critical regime gets narrower when the element size decreases at a fixed value of the macroscopic size of the colliding bodies .    studying kinetic models of fragmentation phenomena in refs.@xcite",
    "it was pointed out that under certain circumstances a so - called shattering transition might occur , when a macroscopic amount of mass of the fragmenting system is transformed into a dusty phase , _",
    "i.e. _ into single polygons in our case . since in discrete dynamical models such a shattering transition can occur only at very high impact energies its investigation is not included in the present study .",
    "the binary break - up of bond percolation clusters due to the removal of a single bond has also been studied in the context of fragmentation phenomena .",
    "the characteristic quantities describing the fragmentation of percolation clusters are the number of fragmenting bonds @xmath92 , _",
    "i.e. _ the number of those bonds in the cluster of size @xmath93 whose removal results in two disconnected clusters , and the probability @xmath94 that the break - up of a cluster of size @xmath93 results in a daughter cluster of size @xmath95 @xcite . @xmath92 and @xmath94 are of fundamental interest because they describe the connectivity of percolation clusters and they may also serve as an input for the rate equations describing fragmentation processes as a sequence of binary events @xcite . at the critical point",
    "@xmath96 both @xmath97 and @xmath98 show interesting scaling behavior whose scaling exponents could be related to the critical exponents of percolation @xcite , but no phase transition was claimed in the break - up process . although the form of @xmath98 as a function of the daughter mass @xmath95 and its dependence on the global size of the fragmenting object @xmath93 @xcite is similar up to some extent to the behavior of our fragment mass distribution at the critical point @xmath45 ( see fig.[fig : fig8 ] ) , there is no direct analogy between the binary break - up of percolation clusters and our dynamic fragmentation process .",
    "up to our knowledge no systematic experimental study of the transition from damage to fragmentation in impact of solids has been performed so that we can not confront the results of the simulations with experiments . for a deeper understanding of the transition predicted by our simulations",
    "further experimental and more analytical theoretical studies are needed .",
