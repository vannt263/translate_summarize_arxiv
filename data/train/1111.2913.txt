    "in most experiments , superheavy elements are formed via mass asymmetric fusion - evaporation reaction , with a light projectile impinging on a heavy target  @xcite .",
    "symmetric entrance sytems ( where projectile and target have similar masses ) are known to exhibit small fusion cross - sections  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , such systems may have interesting properties , specially when aiming at very heavy elements .",
    "first , such systems can give access to specific isotopes .",
    "this is the case for the @xmath1xe+@xmath1xe that leads to the @xmath6hs compound nucleus which has 6 more neutrons than the one reached through the @xmath7fe+@xmath8pb .",
    "moreover , the excitation energy is low ( @xmath9  mev at the bass barrier , so we can reach the 1 or 2 neutrons evaporation channels only ) , leading to a rather neutron rich evaporation residue .",
    "in addition , future isol radioactive beam facilities , like spiral2 @xcite will provide high intensity neutron - rich beams from uranium fission . in spiral2 , the beams provided with the highest intensities will be neutron - rich kr and xe isotopes .",
    "the latter may be interesting for the production of heavy and superheavy elements in mass quasi - symmetric fusion reactions .",
    "in particular , the use of neutron - rich beams in such reactions could form new isotopes closer to the @xmath10-stability line than with stable beams .",
    "+ some experiments have been dedicated to the synthesis of very heavy elements through symmetric reactions .",
    "the @xmath1xe+@xmath1xe system was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and an upper limit cross - section of 4  pb was obtained . in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the formation of fusion - evaporation residues in the @xmath0sn+@xmath1xe system .",
    "the choice of this reaction is motivated by the relatively light ( and then less fissile ) compound nucleus @xmath11rf and the fact that two closed shells ( z=50 and n=82 ) are expected to favor fusion by limiting quasi - fission in the entrance channel  @xcite . from a technical point of view , it is relatively easy to build solid tin targets .",
    "previous investigations of this system led to respective fusion - evaporation cross - section upper limits of 200  pb at an excitation energy @xmath12  mev  @xcite and 1  nb at @xmath13  mev  @xcite . for comparison , in the reaction @xmath14ti+@xmath8pb leading to the @xmath4rf compound nucleus , the cross sections of the 1n and 2n evaporation channels have been measured to be 10 and 12  nb respectively  @xcite .",
    "+ from an experimental point of view , symmetric reactions have the advantage of a forward focused kinematics compared to asymmetric systems in normal kinematics .",
    "the transmission of the residues through a separator device is enhanced and they are produced with higher kinetic energy ; thus their detection in an implantation detector is facilitated .",
    "the main drawback of symmetric reaction is the relatively close velocities of the residues and of the beam ions , which make them harder to separate .",
    "for this reason , symmetric reactions usually lead to the detection of random events producing a relatively high background in the spectra as compared to asymmetric systems in normal kinematics . here",
    ", we present a practical statistical analysis that takes very rigorously into account the possibility of random correlations .",
    "this kind of analysis is very adapted to any super heavy element production reaction where such conditions of very low signal to noise ratio are encountered .",
    "the experiment took place at ganil , at the end of the lise 3 beam line  @xcite .",
    "the figure  [ fig : setup ] gives a scheme of the set - up .",
    "the css1 cyclotron of ganil provides a 4.61  mev / u @xmath1xe beam with an intensity of @xmath15  pps",
    ". the total dose on target is @xmath16 nuclei .",
    "the isotopically enriched @xmath0sn targets are 400  @xmath17g/@xmath18 thick , with a 40  @xmath17g/@xmath18 carbon backing on the entrance side and 5  @xmath17g/@xmath18 on the exit side . center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy at mid target is @xmath19  mev , for a compound nucleus excitation energy around @xmath20  mev .",
    "the targets are mounted on 18 separated sectors of a 36  cm diameter rotating wheel .",
    "16  cm downstream , a similar wheel hosts 40  @xmath17g/@xmath18 carbon strippers to equilibrate the evaporation residue charge states .",
    "the wheels turned at 2000  rpm during most of the experiment .",
    "the compound nucleus ( cn ) is @xmath11rf and standard statistical calculations predict an evaporation from one to three neutrons .",
    "the ion - optical line is simulated with the zgoubi ray - tracing code  @xcite .",
    "these simulations have been validated in previous experiments @xcite . following the targets and strippers",
    ", a triplet of quadrupoles focuses the nuclei at a focal point at the middle of the wien filter ( wf ) .",
    "this wf consists in two identical symmetric parts .",
    "they both combine a uniform magnetic field with an orthogonal electric field .",
    "if the fields have a ratio @xmath21 , the ions that have a velocity equal to @xmath22 are not deviated , whatever their charge state .",
    "ions with other velocities are deviated . in a standard mode , @xmath22 is chosen to be equal to the velocity of the evaporation residues , which is 1.53  cm / ns in our case .",
    "the beam ions are faster ( 2.93  cm / ns ) and , thus , are deviated toward a copper plate placed at the middle of the wf .",
    "this plate is water - cooled to sustain the heat deposit .",
    "a direct beam with the same velocity as the residues @xmath23  cm / ns after stripping from the carbon foils was used to check the optical tuning .",
    "the charge state distribution was estimated using the model of ref .",
    "@xcite the optimum transmission is calculated to be @xmath24 for the central charge state @xmath25 with an electric field of @xmath26  kv / m and a magnetic field @xmath27  gauss in the wf . with this configuration ,",
    "the rejection of the beam was measured to be @xmath28 which is too small to implement an efficient recoil decay tagging technique .",
    "the rejection was improved up to @xmath2 by increasing the wf magnetic field to @xmath29  gauss , which is associated to a lower @xmath22 . that led to a counting rate of 1300  counts / sec on the full implantation detector .",
    "as there is no free lunch , the cn transmission was also reduced to @xmath30 for the central charge state , resulting to a total transmission of @xmath31 for all charge states .",
    "after the wf , another triplet of quadrupoles is set in order to refocus the transmitted nuclei on the final implantation detector .",
    "the detection system is first composed of two emissive foils detectors .",
    "these detectors are made of aluminized mylar foils of 0.9  @xmath17 m thickness .",
    "when they cross the foil , the heavy ions emit secondary electrons that are accelerated with an electrostatic field toward micro - channel plates ( mcp ) .",
    "their fast signal gives a time reference for the measurement of the time - of - flight ( tof ) .",
    "in addition , a signal in one of the mcp is used as a veto for the detection of alpha or fission decay in the implantation detector .",
    "the efficiency of this veto is above @xmath32 .",
    "the best ( box electron spectroscopy after tagging ) detector closely follows the two emissive foils .",
    "best includes a double - sided silicon - stripped detector ( dsssd ) .",
    "48 strips on each side ( vertical and horizontal ) give the ( x , y ) position .",
    "the detection surface of the dsssd is @xmath33  mm@xmath34 , with a thickness of 300  @xmath17 m .",
    "its resolution is 60  kev ( fwhm ) around 5.5  mev , measured with a 3-@xmath35 source ( @xmath36pu , @xmath37am , @xmath38 cm ) .",
    "relatively to this calibration , the energy of the alpha decays occurring within the detector is corrected from the known dead zone  @xcite . for each implanted ion ,",
    "the tof and energy are recorded for a primary selection of the evaporation residues : for a similar velocity , the kinetic energy of the beam is twice as small as the one of the residue .",
    "four  tunnel  detectors frame the entrance face of the implantation , with their normal perpendicular to the beam axis .",
    "each tunnel detector has a surface of @xmath33  mm@xmath34 , a thickness of 1  mm of silicon , and contains four independent pixels .",
    "they detect backward emitted alpha particles or fission fragments emitted from the implantation dsssd .",
    "this increases the alpha decay detection efficiency from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "the implantation of a residue is detected at a known @xmath41 position . a subsequent decay ( alpha or fission )",
    "is characterized by a signal recorded at the same position , and possibly in one of the tunnel detectors . to make sure that the associated signals come from subsequent decays and not from implantation , the absence of any signal in the two mcp detectors is required .    during the experiment ,",
    "we have also tested a scintillation - ionization chamber that was placed after the mcps , but it is not used in the present analysis due to technical problems .",
    "the details on this detector can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the acquisition of an event was triggered either by a signal in the implantation detector ( most of the events ) or in the tunnel .",
    "finally , the counting rate of around 1  khz generated an electronic dead - time of about @xmath42 .",
    "it is taken into account in the analysis .",
    "beam intensity is also recorded to calculate the absolute cross - sections .",
    "to identify fusion - evaporation residues , a correlation between the energy of the ions and their tof is used .",
    "the energy is given by the dsssd in coincidence with a signal in the first emissive foil detector .",
    "the long path between these two detectors also ensures a good resolution for the tof measurement ( close to 1  ns ) .",
