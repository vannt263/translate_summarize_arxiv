    "in recent years , mri has been recognized as a powerful source of angular momentum transport in accretion discs .",
    "an accretion disc with angular velocity decreasing outward and threaded by a weak magnetic field is linearly unstable ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) . local and global simulations of keplerian discs showed that the mri leads to a turbulence and therefore energy and angular momentum is transported outward ( balbus 2003 ) .",
    "similiarly , the dilute , stratified plasma is bouyantly unstable when the temperature increases in the direction of gravity .",
    "heat is transported mainly along magnetic field lines in such a medium ( balbus 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "the mti has been studied with nonlinear simulations .",
    "parrish and stone ( 2005 ) investigated the nonlinear evolution of the mti and showed that the instability causes turbulence and heat transport .",
    "they noted that mti may explain the almost isothermal temperature profile observed in the outer part of x - ray emitting regions in intracluster medium ( icm ) of galaxy clusters and the structure of radiatively inefficient accretion flows . in the mri and mti",
    ", the weak magnetic fields act as to turn free - energy gradients into sources of the instability .",
    "if the plasma is sufficiently dilute , the viscous stress tensor is also anisotropic ( braginskii 1965 ) .",
    "balbus ( 2004 ) showed that the viscous stress tensor can cause a strong instability in the dilute astrophysical discs .",
    "he showed that the maximum growth rate of instability exceeds that of the mri .",
    "but , he only took parallel component of the stress tensor into account .",
    "the cause of the magnetoviscous instability is the same with mti : initially magnetic field lines are isorotational ( isothermal in the case of mti ) .",
    "perturbed magnetic field lines are stretched out in the direction of the angular velocity ( temperature ) gradient .",
    "thus , angular momentum ( heat ) is transferred from one fluid element to another .",
    "one fluid element at smaller radius drops down to smaller radii and other element moves to more distant radii .",
    "so , the field lines become more bent and the process runs away ( islam & balbus 2005 ) .    indeed , to understand the true nature of the dilute astrophysical plasmas",
    ", we consider magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations which include the terms describing transport of heat and momentum by thermal conduction and viscosity ( braginskii 1965 ) .",
    "dilute means that the ion larmor radius ( @xmath0 ) is small compared with a mean free path ( @xmath1 ) and any macroscopic length scales in the plasma .",
    "this is tantamount to saying that the ion cyclotron frequency ( @xmath2 ) is much greater than the ion - ion collision frequency ( @xmath3 ) . under this condition ,",
    "parallel heat conduction of electrons is much larger than that of ions by the factor @xmath4 and the parallel viscosity of ions is much larger than that of electrons by the same factor .",
    "therefore , an anisotropic electron heat conduction and an anisotropic ion viscosity must be taken into account in the mhd equations .",
    "ramos ( 2003 ) obtained dynamic evolution equations of the parallel heat fluxes in a collisionless magnetized plasma . besides , he noted that neglecting the parallel heat fluxes in low collisional regime can not be justified physically .",
    "he emphasized that one must consider the contribution of the gyroviscosity in the stress tensor for consistency in the analysis .",
    "ramos ( 2005 ) presented the fluid moment equations with finite larmor radius ( flr ) effect for collisionless magnetized plasmas .",
    "his analysis included the gyroviscous stress , the pressure anisotropy and the anisotropic heat fluxes .",
    "he claimed that his formalism can be applicable for arbitrary magnetic field geometry and arbitrary plasma pressure and also fully electromagnetic nonlinear dynamics .",
    "he extended previous study considering collisional terms based on full fokker - planck operators for non - maxwellian distribution functions .",
    "the low collisional regime of interest is described with two small parameters : the ratio of the electron to the ion masses is comparable to @xmath5 ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) and the ratio of the ion collision to cyclotron frequencies is smaller than @xmath7 ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) , where @xmath5 is the fundamental expansion parameter which is the ratio of the ion larmor radius to the shortest macroscopic length scale ( ramos 2007 ) .",
    "recently , ferraro ( 2007 ) examined the flr effects on the magnetorotational instability .",
    "he showed that the flr effects are dominant compared to the other effects which includes the hall effect in the limit of weak magnetic fields .",
    "he restricted his analysis in a vertical magnetic field geometry .",
    "he found that the growth rate of unstable mode is around @xmath9 when the ratio of the gyroviscous force to the magnetic tension force is greater than zero .",
    "but , when the ratio of the gyroviscous force to the magnetic tension force is smaller than zero , there is no unstable mode .",
    "devlen & peknl ( 2010 , paper i ) investigated the stability properties of weakly magnetized , dilute plasmas by considering combined effects of gyroviscosity and parallel viscosity which are components of the stress tensor in the presence of a helical magnetic field geometry .",
    "they showed that although the parallel viscosity is greater than gyroviscosity under the condition of dilute plasma , it hasnt any effect on the instability condition and growth rates",
    ". also they showed that the powerful instability emerges due to finite larmor radius effects .",
    "they estimated that the growth rates of this gvmri varied in the range of @xmath10 for the different values of pitch angles which is the angle between the magnetic field vector and the @xmath11 axis of the coordinate system .",
    "when the ratio of the gyroviscous force to the magnetic tension force is smaller than zero ( i.e. , in the case of @xmath12 ) , they found that there are unstable modes with growth rates around @xmath13 .",
    "this result was contrary to that of ferraro s ( 2007 ) .    to clearly comprehend the dynamics of dilute astrophysical plasmas ,",
    "all the anisotropic transport effects must be taken into account .",
    "therefore , in this work , we extend our previous study ( paper i ) by considering anisotropic electron heat conduction term .",
    "we show that weakly magnetized , differentially rotating dilute plasmas are unstable in the presence of the parallel viscosity , gyroviscosity and thermal conduction .",
    "this novel instability is extremely powerful and occurs at all wavenumbers .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section (  2 ) , we give the linearization of the mhd equations used in our analysis .",
    "we examine the physical structure of modes .",
    "we derive the dispersion relation of instability and the instability criterion . in  3 , we examine the numerical solutions of the dimensionless dispersion relation and finally in  4 , we discuss the physical interpretation of instability and summarize the our results .",
    "the plasma fulfilling the conditions @xmath14 and @xmath15 is called dilute plasma , where @xmath0 is the ion larmor radius , @xmath1 is the ion collision mean free path , @xmath2 is the ion cyclotron frequency and @xmath16 is the inverse of the ion - ion collision frequency .",
    "the presence of the magnetic field introduces anisotropy to the medium .",
    "cyclotron frequencies of the plasma species and the velocity gradients at macroscopic scales are the sources of anisotropy .",
    "if plasma consists only of hydrogens then @xmath17 may be taken as ( spitzer 1962 )    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the proton number density in @xmath20 , @xmath21 the temperature in units of @xmath22 k , @xmath23 is the magnetic field in units of @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "the condition of @xmath26 is fulfilled even in the presence of a very weak field with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    under these conditions ,",
    "the plasma dynamics described by mhd equations should include the anisotropic terms accounting for the free flow of particles along the magnetic field lines ( braginskii 1965 ) .",
    "ion parallel viscosity is higher by a factor @xmath4 than that of electrons .",
    "so , the viscosity of the dilute plasma is determined mainly by the ions . even if the ion viscosity is very small , in a rotating system",
    ", it may become very important ( balbus 2004 ) .",
    "similarly , since the electron contribution to the heat flux is higher than the ion contribution by a factor of @xmath4 , the ion contribution may be considered as negligible . since the electrons have mean free paths much longer than their gyro - radii in the dilute plasma , the thermal conductivity is strongly anisotropic",
    "that is , in the astrophysical dilute plasma threaded even by a weak magnetic field , the momentum by ions and heat flux by electrons is transported primarily along the magnetic field lines .      in an attempt to investigate parallel viscosity , gyroviscosity and heat flux in a dilute plasma , one should consider the two - fluid equations .",
    "below are the standart extended mhd equations which are obtained by using two - fluid equations including stress tensor , @xmath29 , and the heat flux @xmath30 ( see appendix a ) :    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the mass density , @xmath36 is the fluid velocity , @xmath37 is the scalar pressure , @xmath29 is the stress tensor , @xmath38 is the magnetic field , @xmath39 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath30 is the heat flux , and @xmath40 is a lagrangian derivative .",
    "stress tensor have three components which are called as parallel @xmath41 , perpendicular @xmath42 and the gyroviscous @xmath43 ( braginskii 1965 ) .",
    "perpendicular viscosity is greater than the parallel viscosity by a factor of @xmath44 , therefore it may not be taken into account ; where @xmath0 is the larmor radius and @xmath45 is the mean free path of the particles in a dilute plasma .",
    "so , we used parallel and gyroviscous components of the stress tensor which are given by    @xmath46    @xmath47^{t}\\right],\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 , @xmath49 are the unit vector along the magnetic field and the cyclotron frequency .",

    "@xmath30 is dominantly along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the parallel heat flux is given by    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the coulomb conductivity given by spitzer ( 1962 ) as @xmath54 @xmath55 .",
    "we apply a standart wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) perturbation analysis on the equilibruim state . to this analysis ,",
    "all the variables in the mhd equations are denoted by sums of an equilibrium value ( denoted with a `` 0 '' subscript ) and a small perturbed quantity ( denoted with @xmath5 )    @xmath56    substituting the formulae in equation ( 9 ) into equations ( 2)-(8 ) and retaining only terms up to linear order in perturbations , the linearized perturbation equations are obtained as    @xmath57    @xmath58    @xmath59    @xmath60    the perturbed parallel and gyroviscous components of the stress tensor are    @xmath61,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath62\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{l } \\delta\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}\\times\\mathbf{w}\\cdot\\left(\\mathbf{i}+3\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}\\right)+\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}\\times\\delta\\mathbf{w}\\cdot\\left(\\mathbf{i}+3\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}\\right)\\\\ + \\mathbf{\\hat{b}}\\times\\mathbf{w}\\cdot3\\delta\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}+\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}\\times\\mathbf{w}\\cdot3\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}\\delta\\mathbf{\\hat{b } } \\end{array } \\right]^t \\end{array } \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the perturbed heat flux is given by    @xmath63.\\ ] ]    the perturbed unit vector of the magnetic field is given by @xmath64 .",
    "before we obtain the dispersion relation which includes all anisotropic transport effects for general axisymmetric disturbances , let us take a glance at the physical meaning of finite larmor radius effect and modes which emerge in the plasma .",
    "we consider the local stability of a uniformly rotating dilute plasma included only a vertical magnetic field , @xmath65 .",
    "we ignore parallel viscosity , heat flux and radial stratification .",
    "we restrict ourself to plane wave perturbations that depend only on @xmath66 , i.e. , of the form @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the radial and azimuthal components of the linearized motion equation are obtained as    @xmath68    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the inverse time scale of the gyroviscous stress .",
    "the same components of the linearized magnetic induction equation are    @xmath71    @xmath72    the gyroviscous force introduces a term like a coriolis term in the equation of motion .",
    "the dispersion relation is    @xmath73+k^4v_a^4=0,\\ ] ]    where @xmath74 is the alfven velocity , @xmath75 is the drift velocity .",
    "flr stress results from changes in particle drift velocities across a gyro - orbit .",
    "this stress gives rise to distortions of particle orbits and guiding - center drift .",
    "kaufman ( 1960 ) presented a detailed discussion of this stress . because ions and electrons have different larmor radii , they move differently due to flr effects .",
    "this different motion gives rise to charge separation .",
    "then it produces a finite parallel electric field .",
    "physically , the flr effects introduce a drift wave that convects the perturbations along the velocity gradient .",
    "if the angular velocity and magnetic field vectors are oriented in the same sense , the term including @xmath76 is positive . from equations ( 17)-(20 ) , one can easily see that the induced drift motion is opposite to the coriolis force .",
    "thus , the dynamical epicycle is slowed and magnetic tension force is effectively increased .",
    "this , in turn , increases the angular momentum transfer .",
    "the result is an instability .",
    "if the angular velocity and magnetic field vectors are counter aligned , the signs of these effects should reverse .    in the limit @xmath77 , the dispersion relation is obtained as    @xmath78+k^4v_a^4=0.\\ ] ]    the solutions of equation ( 22 ) give two roots :    @xmath79\\pm{1\\over 2}\\left[k^4\\left({pmc\\over eb\\rho}\\right)^2\\left(4k^2v_a^2+k^4\\left({pmc\\over eb\\rho}\\right)^2\\right)\\right]^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    one of the roots describes pure drift mode at large wavenumbers . for small wavenumbers ( low frequencies )",
    "the other root is    @xmath80    corresponding to alfven waves with the gyroviscous force producing a small frequency - splitting of the alfven wave ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "one may rewrite the dispersion relation ( 21 ) in the presence of the uniform rotation :    @xmath81    where drift wave frequency is @xmath82 , alfven wave frequency is @xmath83 , pure inertial wave frequency is @xmath84 for general magnetic field geometries and wavenumbers ( mofatt 1978 ) .",
    "the solutions of the equation ( 25 ) are    @xmath85^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    for @xmath86 , it follows @xmath87 .",
    "if the first term is greater than the second one in the brackets in the equation ( 26 ) , then it is possible to carry out a taylor series expansion of this equation .",
    "one then finds a very clear splitting of the fast and slow wave frequencies ,    @xmath88    and    @xmath89    respectively .",
    "these waves result as a combination of the inertial and alfven waves .",
    "they are referred to as magnetocoriolis ( mc ) waves .",
    "when the magnetic field and rotation axis are aligned , the mc wave which imparts a circularly polarized component to the velocity perturbation is in the anticlockwise direction .",
    "therefore coriolis and lorentz forces are in phase .",
    "resulting force causes inertial acceleration .",
    "this mode known as fast mc wave ( i.e. , @xmath90 mode ) . indeed , in the equations ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) the inertial wave is coupled with the drift mode .",
    "so , this mode has a larger frequency compared that of the pure fast mc wave . for @xmath91 mode ,",
    "the mc wave which imparts a circularly polarized component to the velocity perturbation is in the clockwise direction .",
    "hence , coriolis and lorentz forces are out of phase .",
    "resulting force is weakened .",
    "this slow mc mode is sometimes referred to as magnetostrophic wave or hydromagnetic - inertial wave ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "these waves are especially important in the dynamo problem ( moffatt 1978 , achenson & hide 1973 ) .    when the first term is smaller than the second one in the brackets in equation ( 26 ) , one obtains modified alfven waves with frequency splitting after taylor series expansion :    @xmath92    a wavenumber - frequency diagram of these waves is given in figure 3 . in general the angular velocity and magnetic field vectors will not be parallel and the situation will be more complex .",
    "but the physical picture remains the same .",
    "we now consider the axisymmetric behavior of the instability for helical magnetic field and more general wavenumbers .",
    "we work in a cylindrical coordinates system , @xmath93 .",
    "the plasma is assumed to be thermally stratified in the presence of a uniform gravitational field in the radial direction , @xmath94 .",
    "the weak magnetic field is taken to be @xmath95 , where @xmath96 which is called `` pitch angle '' . in equilibrium",
    "the field lines are assumed to be isothermal and therefore heat flux is negligible .",
    "we consider differentially rotating plasma with a keplerian velocity profile , i.e. @xmath97 .",
    "for this profile and weak magnetic field , the stress tensor is negligibly small in the equilibrium for an arbitrary pitch angle ( see appendix b ) .",
    "hence , plasma is in a hydrostatic equilibrium :    @xmath98      all the perturbed quantities are assumed to have a space - time dependence @xmath99 , where @xmath100 .",

    "in a dilute plasma , ion cyclotron frequency greatly exceeds ion - ion collision frequency and also electron mean free path is much larger than the gyroradius . therefore , transport of momentum and heat by viscosity and thermal conduction is highly anisotropic with respect to the magnetic field orientation . in this regime , for a more accurate plasma model the anisotropic transport terms , i.e. parallel viscosity , gyroviscosity and thermal conduction , must be taken into consideration in the mhd equations .",
    "many astrophysical plasmas display characteristics of the dilute plasma .",
    "for example , physical parameters and the conditions of the intracluster medium ( icm ) of the galaxy clusters are being revealed by telescopes with high resolving powers .",
    "chandra x - ray observatory measured x - ray luminosity ( @xmath234 erg / s ) emitted by the hot plasma in the icm and based on this measurement the density distribution of icm as a function of radius is determined ( parrish , stone and lemaster 2008 ) .",
    "peterson and fabian ( 2006 ) reports that the typical densities are in the range of @xmath235 @xmath236 ; temperatures are @xmath237 kev .",
    "carilli and taylor ( 2002 ) estimated the magnetic field strength in the center of icm about @xmath238 @xmath239 and @xmath240 @xmath239 at the radius of 1 mpc . with the above quoted values plasma beta",
    "is @xmath241 .",
    "this value implies that the icm plasma is dilute and the mean free path of electrons is much longer than their gyroradius ( narayan & medvedev 2001 ) .    under these physical conditions ,",
    "dilute and hot plasma in a differentially rotating disc is open to a blend of instabilities like , mri , mti and gvmri .",
    "we proceed the analysis from simple to complex .",
    "let us start with a useful mechanical model developed by balbus & hawley ( 1992 ) for the mri .",
    "this model consists two fluid elements which are tethered each other with vertical magnetic field .",
    "they are also embedded in a radial angular velocity gradient , so that the element orbiting at smaller radius rotates rapidly than the other element orbiting at larger radius .",
    "we suppose that these elements are residing at different vertical locations , but at the same radial locations initially . when these elements are radially displaced , the magnetic field will force them to return at their original locations .",
    "the outward element acquires angular momentum because it has a smaller velocity in its new radial location .",
    "but the inward element loses angular momentum , because it has a greater velocity in its new radial location .",
    "when the field lines become more stretched , since the inner element continues to lose its angular momentum , it will fall farther inward ; the other element moves farther out and gains the higher angular momentum .",
    "thus , process runs away and instability occurs .",
    "this is a classical mri picture ( balbus & hawley 1992 , 1998 ) . the ions ( because ion viscosity is higher than that of electrons in the dilute plasma ) in the fluid elements gyrate around the magnetic field lines and will be under the influence of a spatially varying electric field which arises from flr effects . in the shear flow",
    "there is no rest frame .",
    "therefore the elements in different locations are exposed to different electric fields ( @xmath242 ) . along a gyro - orbit ,",
    "the length scale of electric field is comparable to length scale of velocity gradient ( williams & jokipii 1991 ) . if the initially positions of elements is selected as a rest frame , the fluid velocity increases towards smaller @xmath243 values .",
    "so , the inward element will see larger electric field because it has greater velocity according to the outward element .",
    "since the drift is controlled by the magnitude of the electric field , the fluid element with a larger relative velocity will drift more rapidly . because the magnetic field which tethers fluid elements to each other acts as spring - like force ,",
    "the rapidly increasing element separation gives rise to growing spring tension .",
    "thus , process runs away and instability occurs quickly .",
    "this is a gvmri picture .    the modified hill equations by the inclusion of gyroviscosity , thermal conduction and parallel viscosity can help one to get a better physical understanding of instability . in the absence of all three dynamical effects , one recovers the original set of equations describing the mri ( balbus & hawley 1992 , 1998 ) .",
    "in equations ( 54 ) and ( 55 ) below , @xmath244 and @xmath245 are the radial and azimuthal displacements of fluid elements .",
    "@xmath246\\xi_{r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath247\\xi_{\\phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where all the abbreviations are the same as above .",
    "the right hand sides ( r.h.s . ) of the equations ( 54 ) and ( 55 ) represent the torque applied to the fluid elements which correspond to `` spring '' constants in radial and azimuthal directions .",
    "comparison of r.h.s . of the equations ( 54 ) and ( 55 ) show that the gyroviscosity couples to the differential rotational , the thermal conduction couples to the coriolis force , the radial gradients of the temperature and the pressure .",
    "these complex couplings make the roles of the anisotropic forces intangible .",
    "we solve equation ( 55 ) for @xmath245 and then substitute it into equation ( 54 ) to find the acceleration of the perturbed fluid element in the radial direction . in order the hot , dilute and differentially rotating disc to be unstable",
    "there should be a net outward acceleration :    @xmath248\\xi_{r}\\nonumber\\\\ -\\left[{d\\omega^2\\over d\\ln r}\\tilde{v}_{gyro}{g\\over 2}+4\\omega^2\\left(-\\tilde{v}_{gyro } a+{1\\over 4}\\tilde{v}_{gyro}^{2}a^2\\right)-8\\omega^2\\left(1-{1\\over 2}\\tilde{v}_{gyro}a\\right)^2{y\\over ( \\omega^2+y)}\\right ] \\xi_{r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath249 $ ] .",
    "accelaration given by the equation ( 56 ) can be written as a sum of three terms respectively , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath250 .",
    "@xmath251 , given by the equation ( 56 ) is the acceleration term arising from the magnetic tension force which is always stabilizing .",
    "the second acceleration term @xmath252 is due to the radial bouyancy force and anisotropic thermal conduction . and",
    "it is a pure hydrodynamic term .",
    "this term is related to the convective instability in which the source of free energy is the temperature gradient . in the absence of the viscous force ,",
    "when the temperature increases in the direction of gravity , this term has a destabilizing effect and when the temperature decreases in the direction of gravity , it has a stabilizing effect .",
    "the third acceleration term @xmath253 is due to the radial gyroviscous force .",
    "so , it is related to the gvmri .",
    "this term depending on the pitch angle , the wavenumbers , gyroviscous force and the parallel viscosity may be either positive or negative sign which corresponds to the destabilizing and stabilizing effect , respectively .",
    "the relative importance of the two terms which can be stabilizing or destabilizing are depicted in figure 9 .",
    "figure is drawn as the logaritmic normalized wavenumber versus logaritmic ratio of accelerations @xmath254 for convectively stable plasma , i.e. , @xmath255 .",
    "if @xmath256 , the all unstable modes are gvmri modes .",
    "if @xmath257 , the unstable modes are called as thermal modes . as shown in the figure 9 , mti by driven heat conduction",
    "is dominant in the very small wavenumbers only for the @xmath258 , i.e. , in considering only vertical magnetic field .",
    "in all the possible situations throughout the whole wavelength range , acceleration term @xmath253 due to the gyroviscous force is dominant .",
    "moreover , this acceleration increases rapidly in the large wavenumbers",
    ". @xmath259 term may be positive for the given values .",
    "still , this term does not make a contribution to instability even if @xmath260 .",
    "the above analysis shows that , regardless of the sign of the temperature gradient , a weakly magnetized and convectively stable dilute plasma harbouring the combined effects of gyroviscosity , parallel viscosity and thermal conduction is unstable due to the gyroviscous force .",
    "extension of the unstable regions and the growth rates of gvmri depends sensitively on the pitch angle and the gyroviscosity parameter .",
    "when the angular velocity vector and @xmath188 component of the magnetic field are parallel ( @xmath189 ) , gyroviscosity assumes positive values . when the angular velocity vector and @xmath188 component of the magnetic field are antiparallel ( @xmath12 ) , gyroviscosity assumes negative values .",
    "former , while instability sets in for the smaller pitch angles @xmath261 , later it sets in for the larger pitch angles @xmath202 .",
    "maximum growth rates of the unstable mode is approximately @xmath262 and @xmath194 respectively .",
    "these values are higher than the ones of magnetorotational instability @xmath263 and the ones of magnetothermal instability ( @xmath264 , see figure 4 ) . if the @xmath163 wavenumber is taken into consideration , the instability region becomes narrower and the growth rate of the instability is reduced .",
    "briefly , gvmri is the dominant one in the blend of all three , that is pure mri , mti , gyroviscous modified mri .",
    "because the magnitude and the direction of the temperature gradient do not exert great effect on the unstable mode , this instability may work at all the astrophysical media including dilute plasma .",
