    "harder__the dw is pushed , the more slowly it moves .",
    "this counterintuitive behavior results from the nucleation and gyrotropic motion of vortices within a dw , resulting in oscillatory dw displacements that dissipate energy that would otherwise go into displacing the wall.@xcite    a key theoretical result of dw dynamics is the existence of two regimes of wall propagation separated by a critical field @xmath0.@xcite drive fields @xmath1 below @xmath0 yield dw propagation that obeys a linear mobility relationship @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the dw velocity and @xmath4 is the mobility . drive fields @xmath5 produce a region of negative differential mobility followed by a second region of asymptotic linear mobility ( @xmath6 ) with a significantly smaller mobility parameter than predicted ( and observed ) for @xmath7 .",
    "domain wall motion can be studied by analytical models , which help provide physical insight into dw dynamics , and by more accurate and realistic numerical simulations . in the analytical one - dimensional ( 1d ) model,@xcite a transverse dw has a mobility given by    [ eq:2 ] @xmath8    in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , @xmath9 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath10 ( or @xmath11 ) is the ( average ) dw width , and @xmath12 is the gilbert damping parameter . in the 1d model , the critical field",
    "is called the walker field , @xmath13 .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 specifies the onset of precessional spin motion that drives oscillatory dw motion and accounts for the reduced average velocity and lower mobility .",
    "numerical simulations of static and dynamic dw configurations in rectangular cross - section nanowire structures have shown that the spin configuration within a dw is governed by the nanowire cross - sectional parameters .",
    "thin narrow wires support simple transverse wall ( tw ) spin structures whereas wider and thicker walls support more complex vortex wall ( vw ) structures .",
    "mobility measurements of dw propagation in permalloy ( py ) nanowires@xcite manifest the qualitative behavior predicted by the 1d model , but the measured @xmath0 is @xmath14 , a factor of 10 lower than the 1d model value ( @xmath15 ) ; and the corresponding maximum velocity , @xmath16 , is a factor of 10 lower than @xmath17 .",
    "numerical simulations of spin distributions within the propagating dws account for this large discrepancy : the energy barrier for ( anti ) vortex formation is overcome at values of @xmath1 far below the onset of precessional motion given by the walker field @xmath13 . this ( anti ) vortex formation provides the mechanism for the onset of the low - mobility regime that limits dw propagation velocities to @xmath18 at moderate applied fields . at sufficiently high longitudinal drive fields ,",
    "the dw velocity can reach values equal to or exceeding the value at @xmath0 .",
    "recent numerical simulation studies have explored possible ways to overcome velocity breakdown in nanowires by inhibiting ( anti ) vortex generation .",
    "the first@xcite of these predicted that edge roughness of an appropriate scale should disrupt antivortex formation at the wire edges . in a perfectly smooth wire ,",
    "each nucleated antivortex core was observed to be gyrotropically driven into and across the wire , resulting in velocity breakdown behavior . when edge roughness on the scale of the antivortex core diameter ( @xmath19 ) was added to the simulations",
    ", the inhomogeneous local magnetostatic fields perturbed the nucleated antivortex cores , resulting in annihilations via spin - wave excitations before they were able to enter and slow the dw , thus eliminating the usual drop in velocity above @xmath0 .",
    "however , the dw velocity remained self - limited to @xmath20 even at the fields exceeding @xmath0 .",
    "as the dw speed approached @xmath20 , an edge antivortex was generated and its subsequent decay dissipated energy , slowing the wall velocity .",
    "a similar result was achieved in the simulations of lee _ _ et al.__@xcite using a different means .",
    "the simulated mobility of a dw in an isolated py nanowire was compared to the dw mobility in a py nanowire lying atop a perpendicularly - magnetized underlayer . above @xmath0",
    ", antivortex cores were nucleated at the edge of a propagating tw , but the stray field from the underlayer caused each core to be quickly expelled before it entered the wire . again ,",
    "however , the dw velocity increased with increasing field up to @xmath0 , beyond which the wall velocity reached a plateau . hence , while these studies suggest ways to partially suppress velocity breakdown , they did not predict an increase in the maximum velocity of dw propagation .    a possible route to enhancing the critical velocity",
    "was suggested in the numerical studies of kunz _ _ et al.__@xcite and bryan _ et al._,@xcite which examined the effects of a transverse in - plane bias field @xmath21 on the dynamics of a tw . a related analytical study by sobolev _ _ et al.__@xcite addressed the effects of transverse fields on the motion of ( bloch ) dws .",
    "a bias field , applied normal to wire axis , does not directly drive dw motion , but it does change the width @xmath10 of the wall . when the field is aligned with the net wall moment , @xmath10 increased ; when it is anti parallel to the wall moment , @xmath10 is decreased .",
    "an increase of @xmath10 results in an enhancement of dw velocity , @xmath22 , as expected from the 1d model@xcite ( eq .  [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "the velocity increase is modest , however , up to only @xmath23 , and any benefit ceases beyond the breakdown drive - field threshold . in the oscillatory regime ( @xmath5 ) bryan _ et al .",
    "_ found a region of enhanced dw velocity around @xmath24 for both positive and negative transverse bias field : the average dw velocity recovers to a value slightly above the peak value achieved at @xmath25 .",
    "et al.__@xcite have reported corresponding enhancements in wider nanowire conduits .    in this paper , we describe the effects of a transverse bias field on nanowire guided dw dynamics in the case of wider wires that support more complex dw structures.@xcite we find strikingly different behavior from that predicted for wires of smaller cross section . while simulations show that high - mobility regions of dw propagation exist for @xmath5 in both thin ( tw ) and wider ( vw ) nanowire conduits , the wider conduits exhibit much higher transverse - field induced enhancement of dw velocity .",
    "a py nanowire , @xmath26 wide , @xmath27 thick , and @xmath28 long , was fabricated via focused ion beam milling [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) ] .",
    "one end incorporated a large magnetic pad that served as a nucleation and injection source of dws ; the other end was tapered into a point to inhibit dw nucleation .",
    "high - bandwidth magneto - optic polarimetry@xcite was used to measure the time - dependent dw displacements under a combination of longitudinal drive field @xmath1 and transverse bias field @xmath21 strengths .",
    "one advantage of using polarimetry to track dw displacements by time - of - flight techniques ( and also instantaneous velocity by measuring the transient response@xcite as a dw sweeps across the polarimeter light spot ) is that the mobility curves can be directly measured .",
    "a short injection pulse initiates dw propagation down the nanowire conduit and the velocity ( both average and instantaneous at a prescribed point ) can be measured for any combination of static longitudinal and transverse bias magnetic fields .",
    "micromagnetic simulation was used to understand the experimental results .",
    "the simulations were carried out using a version of llg micromagnetics simulator developed by m. r. scheinfein@xcite that has been adapted to the university of texas lonestar cluster@xcite ( a 5840 processor 64 bit linux - based system capable of 62 tflop / sec peak performance ) .",
    "the numerical simulations were carried out using the accepted parameters for permalloy ( @xmath29 ) ; saturation magnetization @xmath30 , exchange constant @xmath31 , and gilbert damping constant @xmath32 . the unit cell size and integration time step were @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively . to reduce computational time , moving boundary conditions were used , but selected moving boundary condition results were compared with corresponding fixed boundary condition results to ensure accuracy .",
    "the average dw velocity was obtained by averaging over many dw oscillation cycles ( typically @xmath35 ) .",
