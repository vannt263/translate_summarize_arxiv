    "there are several open problems in physics and astrophysics on neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "one of them is why neutron stars do not spin up to the theoretically allowed limit called kepler frequency . in particular",
    ", there is a sharp cut off for spins above 730 , hz which are well below the theoretically allowed upper limit  @xcite .",
    "one possibility is the radiation of gravitational waves from the rapidly rotating pulsars . in particular",
    ", neutron stars may suffer a number of instabilities which come in different flavors but they have a general feature in common ; they can be directly associated with unstable modes of oscillation  @xcite .",
    "the r - modes are oscillations of rotating stars whose restoring force is the coriolis force . the gravitational radiation - driven instability of these modes has been proposed as an explanation for the observed relatively low spin frequencies of young neutron stars and of accreting neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries as well @xcite .",
    "this instability can only occur when the gravitational - radiation driving time scale of the r - mode is shorter than the time scales of the various dissipation mechanisms that may occur in the interior of the neutron star .    the neutron star ( ns ) structure originates from the balance between the short - range character , of the nuclear forces and the long - range gravitational field .",
    "in view of the above , ns is a unique laboratory to test various theories of gravity and also to probe the nuclear equation of state both for low and high baryonic densities .",
    "this is one of the main reasons why neutron stars are considered as the most exciting astrophysical objects .",
    "the density distribution of a neutron star is defined by the hydrodynamic equilibrium as a result of the interplay between the pressure of its ingredient particles and the gravity",
    ". basically , there are two ways to construct the density distribution of a neutron star .",
    "the first one , is by solving numerically the tolman - oppemheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations by employing a specific equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "this method leads directly to a realistic density distribution profile and also provide a configuration of pairs ( m , r ) with one to one correspondence between them .",
    "the second one is to find analytical solution of the tov equations by employing various density profiles . in this case , in each pair @xmath4 corresponds an individual eos .",
    "the analytical solutions have the significant advantage of being applicable for a wide range of pairs @xmath4 and desirably for a wide range of density distribution configurations .",
    "this is the main reason why the analytical solutions , are suitable to study relations that depend weakly on the eos .",
    "actually , there are many analytical solutions , however nearly all of them are physically unrealistic . in particular , the known analytical solutions are divided into two classes  @xcite .",
    "the first class is related to a neutron star in which the density @xmath5 and the pressure vanishes at the surface .",
    "there are only three known analytical solutions that exhibit this behavior : the tolman vii solution  @xcite , the buchdahl solution  @xcite and the naraiai solution@xcite .",
    "the second class of solutions is related to the called self - bounded stars , where while the pressure vanishes at the surface , the density remains finite .",
    "there is a huge number of solutions that exhibit this behavior but the useful ones are various versions of the tolman iv  @xcite and vii  @xcite solutions and also the uniform density solution  @xcite . the above analytical solutions are valuable and interesting because one may study their properties in complete details",
    ". also they are complementary to the numerical solutions  @xcite .",
    "the motivation of the present work is twofold .",
    "first , we intend to examine possible constraints on the r - mode instability related to the bulk neutron stars properties ( mass , radius , density distribution , crust elasticity , e.t.c . ) by employing a suitable set of analytical solutions of tov equations.the most of the mentioned solutions have never been used for the study of the r - mode instabilities in neutron and quark stars ( the only exceptions are the uniform solution , which due to its simplicity , it has been extensively used and the more realistic tolman vii solution ) .",
    "since all of them are related directly both to the bulk neutron stars properties as well as to the their stellar structure , they are suitable for the study of the various instability modes ( included r , f , w and etc . ) .",
    "second , our aim is to examine and even more , if possible , to establish relations between the critical angular velocity @xmath0 and a ) the nuclear equation of state via the slope parameter @xmath2 and b ) the crust elasticity via the slippage factor @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , we propose a correlation between @xmath0 and the derivative of the nuclear symmetry energy with respect to the baryon density .",
    "this idea is based upon the empirical relation between the neutron star radius and the pressure of the neutron star matter for baryon densities , close and even higher to the saturation density , which has been found by lattimer and prakash  @xcite . in any case , it will be of interest to inquire for possible connections between macrophysics properties of a ns ( i.e. mass , radius , moment of inertia , critical angular velocity ) and the microscopic ones ( i.e the isovector character of nuclear forces ) and also to impose constraints on observation data from theoretical predictions and vice - versa . actually , there are some recent efforts to constrain the nuclear physics input ( for example the slope parameter @xmath2 ) by employing the related observation data in low - mass x - ray binaries  @xcite . in general",
    ", this is a very complex problem , since the nuclear equation of state affects in different ways the r - mode instability .",
    "additional work is needed as well , to illustrate further this point .",
    "the present work is dedicated to this effort .",
    "the article is organized as followed . in sec",
    "ii we briefly review the r - mode formalism . in section",
    "iii we present the connection between the nuclear equation of state and bulk neutron star properties .",

    "the _ r_-modes evolve with time dependence @xmath6 as a consequence of ordinary hydrodynamics and the influence of the various dissipative processes .",
    "the real part of the frequency of these modes , @xmath7 , is given by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the angular velocity of the unperturbed star  @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part @xmath10 is determined by the effects of gravitational radiation , viscosity , etc . @xcite . in the small - amplitude limit ,",

    "in particular there are several scattering processes which individually contribute to the total shear viscosity . in the present work we consider two kinds of scattering processes : ( a ) the neutron - neutron scattering which is expected to be dominate at @xmath47 k and ( b ) the electron - electron scattering which is the main dissipation mechanism at @xmath48 . in general ,",

    "it is worth pointing out that the mentioned expressions from the time scales and @xmath0 are very general and easily can be determined by employing analytical or / and numerical solution of the tov equations .",
    "now , we consider the effect on r - mode instability due to the presence of a solid crust in an old neutron star .",
    "it is proved that the presence of a viscous boundary layer under the solid crust of a neutron star increases the viscous damping rate of the fluid r - modes @xcite .",
    "actually , the presence of a solid crust has a crucial effect on the r - mode motion and following the discussion of andersson and kokkotas @xcite this effect can be understood as follows : based on the perfect fluid mode - calculations it is anticipated the transverse motion associated with the mode at the crust - core boundary to be large . however ,",
    "if the crust is assumed to be rigid , the fluid motion must essentially fall off to zero at the base of the crust in order to satisfy a non - slip condition ( in the rotating frame of reference ) .",

    "it is well known that the presence of quark and hyperons influences the dissipation mechanisms since one has to take into account the shear and also the bulk viscosities due to the presence of this kind of matter .",
    "the superfluidity is also an additional mechanism which affects the dissipation mechanism in neutron star matter .",
    "actually , there are several recent studies in this direction  @xcite . in any case , when more degrees of freedom are taken into account , the analysis and the prediction of the related instability window become more complete and consequently more reliable .",

    "the main findings include the strong dependence of @xmath0 on the neutron star size and the very weakly dependence on the other two properties for low values of temperature .",
    "secondly , we examined the more realistic case where the effect of the solid crust is included in our study .",
    "we found that in this case the effect of the radius is also the most important but the dependence is more weakly compared to the fluid interior case . in any case the dissipation effect due to the solid crust decreases considerably the instability window .    in view of the above results and motivated by the strong radius dependence of the critical angular velocity",
    ", we propose a phenomenological approach in order to correlate @xmath0 with microscopic properties of the nuclear equation of state .",
    "this approach , despite of its simplicity , provides a few insights on the study of the effects of the eos on the r - mode instability window , in a universal way .",
    "in particular , the radius of a ns depends strongly on the specific character of the eos for densities close to the variation density . by employing an empirical relation , we related the @xmath0 to the slope parameter @xmath2 which is an individual characteristic of any eos .",
    "we also proposed an approximated formula for the @xmath253 dependence applicable for a large number of eos .",
    "this approach leads to some simplified empirical relations .",
    "moreover , the proposed method provides , in a way , constraints on the nuclear equation of state with the help of accurate measurements of the main bulk neutron star properties .",
    "finally , we examine the case of an elastic crust via the slippage factor @xmath3 .",
    "we found that this factor is the most important , concerning the estimation of the instability window .",

    "<S> the gravitational radiation has been proposed a long time before , as an explanation for the observed relatively low spin frequencies of young neutron stars and of accreting neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries as well . in the present work we studied the effects of the neutron star equation of state on the r - mode instability window of rotating neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we employed a set of analytical solution of the tolman - oppemheimer - volkoff equations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we tried to clarify the effects of the bulk neutron star properties ( mass , radius , density distribution , crust size and elasticity ) on the r - mode instability window . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the critical angular velocity @xmath0 depends mainly on the neutron star radius . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the gravitational mass and the mass distribution are almost negligible . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we studied the effect of the elasticity of the crust , via to the slippage factor @xmath1 and also the effect of the nuclear equation of state , via the slope parameter @xmath2 , on the instability window . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the crust effects are more pronounced , compared to those originated from the equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we proposed simple analytical expressions which relate the macroscopic quantity @xmath0 to the radius , the parameter @xmath2 and the factor @xmath3 . finally , we investigated the possibility to measure the radius of a neutron star and the factor @xmath3 with the help of accurate measures of @xmath0 and the neutron star temperature .    </S>",
