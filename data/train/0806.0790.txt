    "in this paper we will also consider rwre on  @xmath28 , with reflection to the right at the origin .",
    "this rwre can be defined as above , in the environment  @xmath29 given by @xmath30 ( provided , of course , that the starting point is nonnegative ) .",
    "we then write @xmath31 , @xmath32 for the quenched probability and expectation in the case of rwre reflected at the origin , @xmath33 and  @xmath34 for the annealed probability and expectation , keeping the simplified notation @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 for the rwre starting at the origin .    for all @xmath39 , let us introduce @xmath40 throughout this paper , we assume that @xmath41<0,\\ ] ] which implies ( cf .",

    "@xmath11 , so that the rwre is transient to the right ( or simply transient , in the case of rwre with reflection at the origin ) .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a general overview of results on rwre . in the following we always work under the assumption that @xmath43=1 \\text { and } { \\mathbf{e}}[\\rho_0^{\\kappa}\\ln^+ \\rho_0]<\\infty.\\ ] ]    this constant plays a central role for rwre ,",
    "in particular when it exists , its value separates the _ ballistic _ from the _ sub - ballistic _ regime : @xmath44 we refer to the case @xmath45 as the _ ballistic _ regime and to the case @xmath46 as the _ sub - ballistic _ regime . in this paper",
    "we mainly consider the case where the rwre is transient ( to the right ) and _ sub - ballistic _ , i.e.  the asymptotic speed is equal to  @xmath47 .",
    "the following result was proved in  @xcite and partially refined in @xcite :    [ kks ] let @xmath8 be a family of independent and identically distributed random variables such that    * @xmath48<0 $ ] , * there exists @xmath49 for which @xmath50 = 1 $ ] and @xmath51<\\infty,$ ] * the distribution of @xmath52 is non - lattice .",

    "however , one still can say that at time  @xmath0 the particle is `` typically '' at distance roughly  @xmath61 from the origin , since the weaker result @xmath62 , @xmath26-a.s . , is still valid and  [ t_speedup ] ] .    besides the results about the location of the particle at time @xmath0",

    "we investigate the following types of unusual behaviour of the random walk :    * _ slowdown _ , which means that at time  @xmath0 the particle is around  @xmath69 , @xmath70 , so that the particle goes to the right much slower than it typically does ; * _ backtracking _ , that is , at time  @xmath0 the particle is found around  @xmath7 , thus performing an unlikely excursion to the left instead of going to the right ( this is , of course , only for rwre without reflection ) ; * _ speedup _ , which means that the particle is going to the right faster than it should ( but still with sublinear speed ) : at time  @xmath0 the particle is around  @xmath5 , @xmath71 ( this is possible only for @xmath72 ) .",
    "we refer to all of the above as _ moderate deviations _ , even for the slowdown in the ballistic case @xmath73 .",
    "indeed , in the latter case the deviation from the typical position is linear in time , but we have that the large deviation rate function @xmath74 satisfies @xmath75 , and the known large deviation results only tell us that slowdown probabilities decay slower than exponentially in @xmath0 ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "we mention here that in the literature one can find some results on moderate deviations for the case of recurrent rwre ( often referred to as rwre in `` sinai s regime '' ) , see  @xcite , and also  @xcite for the continuous space and time version .",
    "now , we state the results we are going to prove in this paper .",
    "in addition to ( [ def_kappa ] ) , we will use the following weak integrability hypothesis : @xmath76<\\infty.\\ ] ]    first , we discuss the results about quenched slowdown probabilities .",
    "it turns out that the quenched slowdown probabilities behave differently depending on whether one considers rwre with or without reflection at the origin .",
