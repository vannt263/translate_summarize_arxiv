    "we introduce an `` energy - like '' constraint that the total number of occupied bonds is fixed and study the effects of such a constraint on the critical finite - size scaling ( fss ) .",
    "since occupied bonds can formally be considered as particles , we shall refer to percolation under this constraint as percolation in the canonical ensemble , and to the case without the constraint as percolation in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
