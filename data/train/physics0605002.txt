    "<S> a widespread , intuitive and computationally inexpensive method to analyze light guidance through waveguide bends is by introducing an equivalent straight waveguide with refractive index profile modified to account for actual waveguide bend . </S>",
    "<S> here we revise the commonly used equivalent - index formula , ending up with its simple extension that enables rigorous treatment of one- and two - dimensionally confined , uniformly bent waveguides , including tightly coiled microstructure fibers , curved ridge waveguides and ring microresonators . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that such technique is applicable only to waveguides composed of isotropic or uniaxially anisotropic materials , with anisotropy axis directed perpendicular to the curvature plane .    to understand and to predict light wave behavior at waveguide bends was of major importance and interest to integrated- and fibre - optics community from around 1970s and onwards . </S>",
    "<S> today this interest is stimulated largely by two developments : ( i ) increasing the packaging density of integrated - optic circuits , backed by minimizing integrated waveguide bend radii while keeping bend losses at a tolerable level ; and ( ii ) the advent of photonic crystal fibers possessing quite complicated , high index - contrast dielectric profiles as compared to step- or graded - index fibers for which early theoretical methods to treat bend losses were developed .    </S>",
    "<S> numerical methods to simulate light propagation through waveguide bends , such as beam propagation method  @xcite , the method of lines  @xcite , as well as more general - purpose finite - element and finite - difference techniques , can be very demanding computationally : in one recent example  @xcite , a 64-processors cluster was used in full - vector finite - element modelling . </S>",
    "<S> no wonder one leans to analytic techniques to reduce computation burden whenever possible ; one such technique , perhaps the simplest and most widely used in modelling of microstructure fibre bends today  @xcite , is equivalent - profile method  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it reduces dimensionality of the problem by replacing actual waveguide bend by a straight piece with refractive index profile @xmath0 where @xmath1 is dielectric permittivity in the bent waveguide cross - section , as measured in cartesian frame , @xmath2 is the bend radius pointing from the @xmath3-directed curvature axis to a ( somewhat arbitrary ) waveguide central plane , @xmath4 the distance from that plane . designed for elegant and inexpensive treatment of bends , </S>",
    "<S> though , formula  ( [ standardalternativeepsilon ] ) grounds on approximations whose validity may often be questioned , as those of weak - guidance regime and small curvature ( @xmath5 ) , and originally was introduced for quite a specific case of non - magnetic , step - index , low index - contrast fibre . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we overcome all these limitations by an alternative , first - principle derivation of expressions for modified dielectric permittivity @xmath6 and magnetic permeability @xmath7 analogous to  ( [ standardalternativeepsilon ] ) , but applicable to waveguides of arbitrary cross - section under the only assumption that bend radius is constant ( while not necessarily large ) .    </S>",
    "<S> following schouten  @xcite and post  @xcite , we start from the generally covariant maxwell equations @xmath8 } = -\\dot b_{\\lambda\\nu } , & \\quad &      \\partial_{[\\kappa } b_{\\lambda\\nu ] } = 0 , \\label{maxwellinv1}\\\\      \\partial_{\\nu } \\mathfrak{h}^{\\lambda\\nu } =      \\dot\\mathfrak{d}^\\lambda + \\mathfrak{j}^\\lambda , & \\quad &      \\partial_{\\lambda}\\mathfrak{d}^{\\lambda } = \\rho . \\label{maxwellinv2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the square brackets denote alternation : @xmath9 } = \\frac{1}{2!}(\\cdot_{\\lambda\\nu } - \\cdot_{\\nu\\lambda})$ ] , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are covariant electric vector and magnetic bivector fields coinciding with electric and magnetic three - vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 in cartesian frame , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are contravariant magnetic bivector density and electric vector density of weight @xmath16 corresponding to @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are electric current and charge densities , @xmath21 . with such transformation characteristics assigned to the electromagnetic field quantities , eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ maxwellinv1 ] ) , ( [ maxwellinv2 ] ) are known to be form - invariant  @xcite , i.e. , they do not change their form under arbitrary revertible coordinate transformations </S>",
    "<S> . it might be practical to convert eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ maxwellinv1 ] ) , ( [ maxwellinv2 ] ) with use of dual equivalents @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are pseudo ( hence tildes ) permutation fields equal to levi - civita symbol in any coordinate system , to the form directly reminiscent of maxwell equations in cartesian frame : @xmath26 while the constitutive relations are implied being @xmath27 here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are tensor densities of weight @xmath16 : @xmath30 as stipulated by transformation characteristics of the fields @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> we denote by @xmath35 the jacobian transformation matrix , and @xmath36 its determinant . in this formulation , geometry enters maxwell equations ( [ maxwellinvmod1 ] ) , ( [ maxwellinvmod2 ] ) through material fields ( [ materialconstantstransform ] ) exclusively ; since the form of ( [ maxwellinvmod1 ] ) , ( [ maxwellinvmod2 ] ) is precisely as if they were written in cartesian components , a multitude of analytic and numeric methods developed for rectangular cartesian frame apply . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , whenever @xmath28 and @xmath29 happen to be independent of one ( or more ) of the coordinates in a chosen coordinate system , that coordinate ( or those coordinates ) can be separated in the usual manner , like @xmath37 coordinate in the case of straight homogeneous waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> now we show that in cylindrical coordinates @xmath38 , such ruling out of angular coordinate @xmath39 is the case for , in particular , isotropic guide of arbitrary cross - section , bent along @xmath39 , and specify eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ materialconstantstransform ] ) for that case .    </S>",
    "<S> since isotropic media are defined as those possessing scalar ( though , in general , position - dependent ) permittivity @xmath1 and permeability @xmath40 , as referred to cartesian system , transformation rules ( [ materialconstantstransform ] ) reduce to @xmath41 owing to transformation behavior of the fundamental ( metric ) tensor @xmath42 ; its determinant @xmath43 insofar as @xmath44 in cartesian frame . equations  ( [ isotropicmediacartesian ] ) resemble ` effective ' permittivity and permeability introduced in  @xcite , albeit we would refrain from using the word ` effective ' , on the ground that ( [ isotropicmediacartesian ] ) are nothing but transformation rules for the permittivity and permeability of isotropic media . with transformation from orthogonal cartesian to cylindrical coordinates given by @xmath45 ( @xmath3 defines bending axis ) , one can find the cartesian - to - cylindrical transformation matrix for contravariant components @xmath46 and contravariant metric tensor @xmath47 @xmath48 . after substituting these expressions in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ isotropicmediacartesian ] ) , separating the @xmath39 variable in maxwell equations  ( [ maxwellinvmod1 ] ) , ( [ maxwellinvmod2 ] ) and differentiating the @xmath49 multipliers with respect to @xmath39 , normalizing the propagation constant @xmath50 by @xmath2 in the usual manner and introducing shifted coordinate @xmath51 , one obtains @xmath52 ( we do not distinguish between co- and contravariant indices once particular coordinate system is chosen ) , and similarly for permeability components : @xmath53 note that expressions for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , multiplied by their magnetic counterparts , lead to refractive tensor components @xmath56 and @xmath57 precisely in line with standard formula  ( [ standardalternativeepsilon ] ) in the case of non - magnetic media . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath58 and @xmath59 components manifestly differ from the rest , however ( see figure  [ refractivetensorcomponents ] ) ; this difference becomes especially pronounced when departing from weakly guiding approximation , as soon as non - negligible @xmath37-components of electric and magnetic fields would ` probe ' the @xmath60 and @xmath61 profiles then .     </S>",
    "<S> of waveguide with bending , for diagonal refractive tensor components @xmath62 according to eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ myalternativeisotropiceps ] ) , ( [ myalternativeisotropicmu]).,width=313 ]    a benchmark example to illustrate the validity of formulae  ( [ myalternativeisotropiceps ] ) , ( [ myalternativeisotropicmu ] ) is a problem of light propagation through a homogeneous slab waveguide bend that permits precise analytic treatment  </S>",
    "<S> see e.g.  @xcite for an overview . in our approach , covariant maxwell curl equations , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , </S>",
    "<S> reduce to four independent first - order scalar equations then , grouped in two pairs : one for the @xmath65 , @xmath66 components ( te mode ) : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the free - space wavenumber , @xmath69 the dimensionless mode index ; and another pair for @xmath70 , @xmath71 ( tm mode ) . to derive second - order equation for @xmath65 ( which can be regarded as an eigenproblem in @xmath72 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we differentiate  ( [ ex ] ) with respect to @xmath73 , use  ( [ hf ] ) for @xmath74 and @xmath75 to exclude @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads , in the regions of constant @xmath40 , to @xmath76 a bessel equation used customarily in exact analysis of bent slab waveguides  @xcite , while an attempt to get similar equation with use of approximate equivalent - index formula  ( [ standardalternativeepsilon ] ) fails . </S>",
    "<S> the results of full - vector two - dimensional finite - difference frequency - domain ( fdfd ) modelling of confined modes in a high - contrast step - index optical fibre ( figure  2 ) demonstrate systematic discrepancy between approximate model  ( [ standardalternativeepsilon ] ) and formulae  ( [ myalternativeisotropiceps ] ) , ( [ myalternativeisotropicmu ] ) ; a discrepancy which can not be tolerated in realistic simulations of high index contrast ridge waveguides and holey fibers , ring microresonators , or sharp fibre bends such as those due to non - perfect alignment of fibre splices .     of a step - index fibre of radius @xmath77 and dielectric index @xmath78 in the air background , </S>",
    "<S> calculated numerically with  ( [ standardalternativeepsilon ] ) and  ( [ myalternativeisotropiceps ] ) , ( [ myalternativeisotropicmu]).,width=313 ]    a closer inspection of  ( [ amatrix ] ) brings to conclusion that the only type of initial anisotropy in @xmath1 and @xmath40 which still permits ruling out the @xmath39 dependence in @xmath28 and @xmath29 transformed according to  ( [ materialconstantstransform ] ) is that of uniaxial crystal with anisotropy axis pointing in the @xmath3 direction ( i.e. , along the bend axis ) : @xmath79 in that case , one gets instead of formulae  ( [ myalternativeisotropiceps ] ) : @xmath80 and likewise for modified @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , however , the case of anisotropy given by  ( [ tensorialepsilonpermitted ] ) is not one encountered when modelling , e.g. , photonic bandgap fibre filled with liquid crystal ; for that and other examples of curved waveguides possessing anisotropy of some general kind , _ rigorous _ equivalent - profile formulation is not applicable and should be substantiated by more brute - force numeric or less stringent analytic techniques .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> equivalent - profile expressions  ( [ myalternativeisotropiceps ] ) , ( [ myalternativeisotropicmu ] ) to treat waveguide bends have been presented . unlike conventional formula  ( [ standardalternativeepsilon ] ) , they hold for arbitrarily tight bends , arbitrary high - contrast material profiles , and permit the inclusion of magnetic parts . </S>",
    "<S> this offers three - dimensional modelling accuracy with those existing full - vectorial two - dimensional finite - difference or finite - element solvers which permit @xmath81 diagonal matrices for @xmath6 and @xmath7 be put in . eliminating the restraints on bend radius and refractive index contrast enables one to simulate also the whispering - gallery modes in spherical , toroidal and other types of optical microcavities . </S>",
    "<S> the principal limitation of the equivalent - profile technique is that many cases of non - trivial anisotropy can not be treated rigorously in the manner above . </S>"
