    "recently the total magnetic and dipole moments of isolated rare - earth clusters ( pr , tb , ho and tm ) in the gas phase have been measured experimentally for a size range of 5 - 30 atoms  @xcite .",
    "these experiments show a very interesting and unexpected behavior completely different from the bulk .",
    "for example , for tb clusters the magnetic moment oscillates heavily as function of cluster size , while for tm and pr clusters there is almost no size dependence .",
    "further , there appears to be a large electric dipole moment for certain tm cluster sizes .",
    "understanding the principles behind this behavior is important not only from a fundamental point of view , but also for possible applications at nanoscale .",
    "however , before the problem of magnetism or any problem in general for rare - earth clusters can be addressed , an absolutely crucial foundation has to be layed .",
    "namely the knowledge of the number of 4@xmath0 electrons or equivalently the number of @xmath1 electrons of the rare - earth clusters is required .",
    "this is often referred to as the valence .",
    "this valence for rare - earth clusters is not trivial , because in general as an isolated atom a rare - earth has one 4@xmath0 electron more than in its bulk form  @xcite .    in order to study magnetic properties of rare - earth systems , knowledge of the number of 4@xmath0 electrons constituting the local magnetic moments and the number of @xmath1 electrons mediating the coupling between them",
    "is required .",
    "further , the valence of the rare - earths is known from previous works to depend delicately on chemical surrounding or geometry . for instance",
    ", it is known that the surface of elemental sm is divalent  @xcite , whereas the bulk is trivalent .",
    "overall , the valence is intimately coupled to many of the important properties of the rare - earths .",
    "it is this crucial foundation of the valence that is here addressed for clusters .",
    "we evaluate the electronic structure and the total energy of such clusters , using density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite , combined with the born - haber cycle  @xcite .",
    "we selected three elements sm , tb and tm , since they are known to have small energy difference between a trivalent and divalent configuration in the bulk  @xcite , and due to recent experimental interest  @xcite .",
    "it is well known for rare - earth bulk systems that dft in its conventional localized density approximation ( lda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) form is inadequate  @xcite .",
    "this failure is caused by the localized 4@xmath0 electrons , for which the electron - electron repulsion is strong , which can not be described properly by functionals derived in the limit of a nearly uniform electron gas .",
    "therefore , we chose to work with the dft+dmft  @xcite approach in the limit of zero hybridization , i.e. the hubbard - i approximation ( hia )  @xcite , is used to calculate the spectral properties of these clusters . before a hia calculation",
    "can be performed , the geometry , the valence stability , hubbard @xmath2 parameter and the first 4@xmath0 peak position below the fermi level of the cluster must be known . for the geometry calculations ,",
    "the 4@xmath0 electrons are made chemically inert by treating them as part of the core  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , to calculate the valence stability and first 4@xmath0 peak position below the fermi level , we follow refs .  .",
    "the born - haber cycle has already been used with great success and accuracy to calculate the valence and first 4@xmath0 peak below the fermi level for the whole 4@xmath0 bulk series  @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that with the exception of eu , yb and the @xmath3-phase of ce , all rare - earth elements form trivalent configurations in the solid  @xcite .",
    "eu and yb are divalent , because this configuration provides a half - filled or filled 4@xmath0 shell  @xcite . on the contrary",
    "the isolated rare - earth atoms are all divalent with the exception of la , ce , gd and lu , which are trivalent .",
    "the transition from atom to solid can be seen as a function of clusters with increasing size .",
    "the valence stability of the end points is known precisely . for sm , tb and",
    "tm the atom is divalent whereas the bulk is trivalent .",
    "the valence of clusters is completely unknown and it is reasonable to ask how the transition from divalent to trivalent occurs as a function of increasing cluster size , for what size of clusters it happens and if mixed valence configurations are possible .",
    "in case of the valence the aim is to calculate the total energy difference between a divalent , @xmath4^{2}$ ] , trivalent , @xmath5^{3}$ ] and mixed valence configuration .",
    "unfortunately , these total energies ( differences ) are not directly accessible for rare - earth systems in conventional dft ( lda or gga )  @xcite . however , for localized and thus strongly correlated systems the born - haber cycle can be used for this purpose .",
    "the idea is to exploit the fact that the 4@xmath0 shell is so localized that it is essentially the same in the atom as in the isovalent cluster .",
    "this gives the opportunity to combine dft calculations , in which intra and inter 4@xmath0 couplings are neglected , with atomic experimental information to include these couplings .    in fig .",
    "[ bornhaber ] the born - haber cycle is schematically depicted for the computation of the energy difference @xmath6 between a pure divalent and trivalent configuration . from this figure",
    "it is immediately clear that @xmath6 can not be computed directly in conventional dft due to the lack of a proper description of the localized 4@xmath0 shell . to a good approximation",
    "the difference between the inter 4@xmath0 couplings , @xmath7}(iii)_{cluster}$ ] and @xmath7}(ii)_{cluster}$ ] , can be neglected @xcite .",
    "thus it remains to compute the energy difference between the intra 4@xmath0 couplings , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by going around the cycle via the atomic energies , since these intra 4@xmath0 couplings then cancel with their isovalent atomic counterparts . however , by going around the cycle in this way , three new quantities have to be introduced , i.e. @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the former is the energy required to promote a 4@xmath0 electron to the 5@xmath13 shell in the atom and the latter two represent the coupling energy between the 4@xmath0 shell and the 5@xmath13 shell .",
    "since there is no 5@xmath13 electron in the divalent atom , @xmath12 is zero , while the other two are known experimentally  @xcite .    besides the introduction of these experimentally known atomic quantities ,",
    "the energy difference between the decoupled ( intra and inter 4@xmath0 coupling neglected ) isovalent atom and cluster should now be accuratly computed .",
    "this energy difference is often referred to as generalized cohesive energy and is known to be reproduced very well by dft  @xcite .",
    "coupling , while the full lines corresponds to full total energy .",
    "further , @xmath10 is the atomic @xmath0 to @xmath13 promotion energy , @xmath12 and @xmath11 refer to the coupling between the 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath13 shell of respectively the divalent and trivalent atom , @xmath7}(ii)_{cluster}$ ] and @xmath7}(iii)_{cluster}$ ] correspond to the coupling between the 4@xmath0 shell and @xmath1 states of respectively the divalent and trivalent cluster , and @xmath14 terms refer to intra 4@xmath0 shell couplings . , width=302 ]    the concept above can be easily extended to more general configurations , e.g. mixed valence configurations .",
    "the expression for the energy difference per atom @xmath6 between a pure trivalent and mixed valence configuration thus becomes , @xmath15- \\\\",
    "\\bigl[\\frac{n_{div}}{n_{tot}}e(ii)_{atom}+\\frac{n_{triv}}{n_{tot}}e(iii)_{atom}-e(mix)_{cluster}\\bigr]-\\\\ \\frac{n_{div}}{n_{tot}}\\bigl[e_{fd}+e_{c , f\\to d}(iii)_{atom}\\bigr ] . \\end{gathered } \\label{bornmix}\\ ] ] here @xmath16 is the total number of atoms in the pure trivalent and mixed valence cluster , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 correspond respectively to the number of divalent and trivalent atoms in the mixed valence cluster .",
    "further , @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond to the total energy per atom with intra and inter 4@xmath0 coupling neglected for a trivalent and mixed valence configuration of a cluster .",
    "similarly @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the total energy with intra and inter 4@xmath0 coupling neglected of a trivalent and divalent atom",
    ". finally , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the atomic correction energies that are obtained from experiment .",
    "note that the first term between square brackets in eq .",
    "[ bornmix ] is the generalized cohesive energy of a trivalent configuration .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath20 would correspond to a purely divalent configuration ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 in eq .  [ bornmix ] ) , then the second term between square brackets in eq .",
    "[ bornmix ] refers to the divalent generalized cohesive energy .      for the explanation of the calculation of the first 4@xmath0 peak below the fermi level , ref",
    ".   is followed . in this work the first 4@xmath0 peak below the fermi level is calculated for all elemental bulk rare - earth systems .",
    "the first thing to consider is that the time scale on which a photo - emission process takes place is too short for the geometry to follow .",
    "second , consider a bulk system from which in one unit cell a 4@xmath0 electron is removed .",
    "this process can be artifically divided into two steps : ( 1 ) a 4@xmath0 electron is promoted to the valence band and ( 2 ) an electron is adiabatically taken out of the valence band . in bulk the ionization energy of the ground state and the state with one 4@xmath0 electron promoted to the valence band are virtually the same due to the screening of this 4@xmath0 hole by the valence electrons .",
    "this means that with respect to this ionization energy the first 4@xmath0 peak position corresponds to the total energy difference between the ground state and the state in which one atom is replaced with one 4@xmath0 electron less and one valence electron more .",
    "thus again the born - haber cycle can be exploited here .    for clusters",
    "however it is not clear whether the valence electrons are able to fully screen the 4@xmath0 hole . in other words in case of the bulk there is an infinite number of sites of which only one is changed by the promotion of a 4@xmath0 electron to the valence band .",
    "however , in case of our clusters thereare less than 9 sites , which means that we can not neglect this change of one site on forehand .",
    "thus , there could be a difference in ionization energy between the ground state and a state in which one 4@xmath0 electron is promoted to the valence states with respect to the ground state .",
    "this difference is estimated by the difference in the eigenvalues of the highest occupied kohn - sham orbital of these states .",
    "all the calculations in this report are performed with a full potential linear muffin - tin orbital ( fp - lmto ) method  @xcite .",
    "a gga parametrization of the exchange - correlation functional as formulated by perdew , burke , and ernzerhof is used  @xcite . since the used fp - lmto program is originally designed for periodic bulk systems , a large cubic unit cell of 16   dimension is used to prevent the interaction between clusters of different unit cells .",
    "further , a calculation for the gamma point only is done .",
    "the basic geometrical and basis setup is the same for all calculations described above . a muffin - tin radius of 2.6  a.u .",
    "the main valence basis functions are chosen as 6@xmath25 , 6@xmath26 and 5@xmath13 states , while 5@xmath25 and 5@xmath26 electrons are treated as pseudocore in a second energy set  @xcite .",
    "the 4@xmath0 states are treated as valence states for the hubbard - i calculations , while for all the other calculations they are treated as core states . in the latter case 5@xmath0 states are instead added to the valence electrons , in order to have basis functions with @xmath0 angular character .",
    "three kinetic energy tails were used for 6@xmath25 and 6@xmath26 states  @xcite , with values -0.3 , -2.8 and -1.6  ry .",
    "further , a hubbard @xmath2 of 8  ev is used for the hubbard - i calculations of the spectral properties of the sm , tb and tm clusters .",
    "this value of @xmath2 is commonly used for the 4@xmath0 shell of the rare - earths  @xcite . in addition to the hubbard @xmath2 parameter also the onsite exchange interaction @xmath27 is needed . for the @xmath27",
    "it is well known that it is almost system independent  @xcite and is therefore taken to be 1  ev  @xcite .",
    "details on the implementation of the hubbard - i routine , that is used in this work , are given elsewhere  @xcite , and we refer the reader to those studies for a complete description of our methods .",
    "the double counting is fixed by adjusting the first 4@xmath0 peak below the fermi level to the one calculated ( see fig .  [ hubbardu_4f ] ) and by the required number of 4@xmath0 electrons ( see fig .  [ valenceresults ] ) .",
    "namely within the hubbard - i approximation the local self energy is obtained from the following atomic like problem    @xmath28    here @xmath29 and @xmath30 correspond to the creation and annihilation operators of local strongly correlated state @xmath31 . the first term @xmath32 contains the dft single particle hamiltonian projected onto the strongly correlated states .",
    "the second term contains the spin - orbit coupling effects and the third term the onsite coulomb repulsion effects between the strongly correlated orbitals .",
    "finally , the last term contains the chemical potential @xmath33 .",
    "this term is used to embed the atom in the cluster .",
    "furthermore , it is used as a double counting correction .",
    "namely some effects of the @xmath34 term are already included in the @xmath32 term .",
    "there are different possibilities to choose for the double counting  @xcite .",
    "we treat the chemical potential as an adjustable parameter in such a way that it is determined by the number of 4@xmath0 electrons and the first 4@xmath0 peak below the fermi level .    for the calculation of the valence different starting geometries",
    "have been considered and optimized for each valence configuration separately .",
    "the wrapped polyhedron method was used to optimize the structures  @xcite . for the other calculations , i.e. the first 4@xmath0 peak position below the fermi level and 4@xmath0 pdos ,",
    "the geometry is fixed to the thus found lowest energy geometry .",
    "by applying the born - haber cycle to sm , tb and tm clusters in a size range of 2 - 8 atoms we obtain the valence ( see fig .  [ valenceresults ] ) . in this graph , we show the difference in the generalized cohesive energy between a pure trivalent and divalent configuration for different sized clusters . we also show the atomic correction energies ( @xmath10 plus @xmath35 as described in fig .",
    "[ bornhaber ] ) . from eq .",
    "[ bornmix ] it is clear that when the generalized cohesive energy difference is larger than the sum of atomic correction energies a trivalent state is more favorable . in general , fig .  [ valenceresults ] shows that the generalized cohesive energy becomes larger for clusters with more atoms , since this allows for more chemical bonds to be made .",
    "hence one may expect in general that as the clusters become larger , the divalent state of the atom should become less favorable .",
    "this is indeed what fig .",
    "[ valenceresults ] shows .",
    "[ valenceresults ] also shows that sm and tb clusters are respectively divalent and trivalent for all clusters investigated here .",
    "we find however that for sm a transition from divalent to trivalent clusters should occur for cluster sizes just above 8 .",
    "a different behaviour is observed for tm , since there is a change from divalent to trivalent at a size of 6 atoms . for increasing cluster size , sm ,",
    "tb and tm slowly approach their bulk generalized cohesive energies values of respectively 2.64 , 2.69 and 2.96  ev  @xcite .",
    "these bulk generalized cohesive energies change only gradually through the whole rare - earth series @xcite . translating this behavior also to the clusters ,",
    "the sm , tb and tm data points can be extrapolated ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ valenceresults ] ) to make predictions for all rare - earth clusters up to a size of 8 atoms .",
    "for example , the dimers of dy , ho and er are predicted to be divalent , while for larger cluster sizes they are trivalent .",
    "note however that the behavior of the generalized cohesive energy of the sm dimer somewhat differs from the rest , i.e. 3 - 8 atom clusters and the bulk .",
    "this discrepancy is the result of a larger 5@xmath13 electron contribution to the binding for the sm dimer compared to the tb and tm dimer . for clusters larger than 3 atoms",
    "this difference in binding becomes negligible small .",
    "thus , the extrapolation for the dimers should be interpreted with a little bit of caution .        so far only pure divalent and trivalent configurations have been compared .",
    "however , eq .  [ bornmix ] is also used to consider possible mixed valence configurations . as an example the results for tb@xmath36 , tm@xmath37 , tm@xmath38 , sm@xmath39 and sm@xmath40 are shown in table  [ mixedtable ] . here",
    "the latter four are chosen , because they are close to a valence transition .",
    "contrary tb@xmath36 is a simple example , that is far from a valence transition .",
    "note that all ( mixed ) valence configurations are compared with respect to the pure trivalent configuration .",
    "thus a positive energy difference means that the pure trivalent configuration is more favorable and negative values mean that some or all atoms will be in the divalent configuration .",
    ".the energy difference between the pure trivalent @xmath41 and other possible configurations @xmath42 is given in column three in ev per atom . here",
    "a positive number means that the pure trivalent configuration is more favorable and negative values mean that some or all atoms will be in the divalent configuration . in the second column the first and second number represent respectively the total number of divalent atoms @xmath43 and trivalent atoms @xmath44 of configuration @xmath45 .",
    "the first column describes the system .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     table  [ mixedtable ] shows that for tm there is an abrupt change from pure divalent to trivalent , when the cluster size changes from 5 to 6 .",
    "these pure states are favorable over mixed valence states by roughly less than 0.1  ev / atom .",
    "this abrupt valence change appears rather unexpectedly , having in mind that rough surfaces of tm bulk are divalent  @xcite . for sm@xmath39 and sm@xmath40",
    "also the pure divalent state is preferred over the mixed valence states by about 0.1 and 0.01  ev / atom respectively .",
    "however , the errors involved in these calculations are of the order of 0.1  @xcite , which makes it difficult to resolve energy differences of this size .",
    "further , at finite temperatures the mixed valence configurations could become more favorable due to their higher entropy .",
    "thus , the absence of mixed valence configurations in table  [ mixedtable ] , can not be used rigorously to exclude mixed valence states of these clusters , especially when the energy difference between configurations is of order 0.1  ev / atom or smaller . in experiments on rare - earth clusters incorporated in an ar matrix ,",
    "abrupt valence changes were indeed observed  @xcite . in ref .",
    "the valence transition for sm and tm clusters is observed at a size of respectively 6 and 10 atoms , which is in agreement with our results .",
    "however , the results of ref .   for pr , nd and sm clusters do not agree with our data .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that in the experiments of refs .",
    "it is very hard to accurately estimate the cluster size .",
    "we now turn our attention to the calculation of spectroscopic information , since it is a very natural way to experimentally detect the valence . to this end",
    "we adopt the hia .",
    "however , before the hia can be used , the number of 4@xmath0 electrons and the first 4@xmath0 peak position below the fermi level should be known for the clusters ( see section  [ doc ] ) .",
    "the results of the calculations for the first 4@xmath0 peak position below the fermi level are presented in fig .",
    "[ hubbardu_4f ] .",
    "note that for example for the 4 and 6 atom clusters for the blue atom 2 and the grey atoms 1 only one rare - earth element is specified .",
    "this means that for the skipped rare - earth elements these are equivalent atoms , i.e. for sm@xmath46 and tm@xmath46 sites 1 and 2 are equivalent , for tb@xmath47 and tm@xmath47 sites 1 and 3 are equivalent , and for sm@xmath48 sites 1 , 2 and 4 are equivalent . for the 8-atom cluster information on sm is not included , because it has a completely different geometry .",
    "pdos calculated with the hia is plotted for ( a ) trivalent tb@xmath36 , ( b ) divalent tm@xmath37 and trivalent tm@xmath38 , and ( c ) divalent sm@xmath39 .",

    "[ hubbardu_4f ] are for the ground state . for sm and",
    "tb this means respectively a divalent and trivalent configuration up to a cluster size of 8 .",
    "it can be observed that this peak position is predicted to be quite site dependent .",
    "also , for tm the binding energy of the first 4@xmath0 peak below the fermi level decreases , when the valence transition ( at a cluster size of 6 atoms ) is approached .",
    "this trend is also clear for sm clusters , as fig .",
    "[ hubbardu_4f ] shows .",
    "hence , data in this figure , as well as the data in fig .",
    "[ valenceresults ] , suggest that also for sm a valence transition will occur , for a cluster size larger than 8 atoms .",
    "interestingly , divalent sm is non magnetic , while trivalent sm is magnetic according to hund s rules . for tb",
    "it is clear that the first 4@xmath0 peak below the fermi level is approaching the bulk position , which is at 2.2  ev below the fermi level  @xcite .",

[ valenceresults ] ) and first 4@xmath0 peak position ( fig .  [ hubbardu_4f ] ) at hand ,",

    "also the atomic multiplet structure can be observed clearly in all these plots . for the reader",
    "s convenience some of the peaks are indicated .",
    "further , from fig .  [ spectra ] ( b ) it is clear that the valency strongly affects the spectrum , and this should hence be a clear possibility to experimentally detect the predicted valence stabilities . also the site dependence of the spectrum can be observed here and in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ( c ) for sm@xmath48 .",
    "in this investigation we outline how the valence stability of rare - earth clusters evolves as a function of cluster size . from first principles",
    "theory , combined with the born - haber cycle and experimental information of the atomic electronic configuration we show that sm and tb clusters are respectively purely divalent and trivalent , respectively , up to a size of 8 . larger clusters of tb are not expected to have a valence transition , whereas from extrapolation we predict that sm clusters with 9 - 10 atoms , or more , will undergo a transition to a trivalent or a mixed valent configuration . as concerns",
    "the valence transition of tm , we find that there is a transition from divalent to trivalent for clusters with six atoms or more .",
    "however , the energy difference between different mixed valence configurations is small , as is the energy difference between a mixed valence configuration and an integer valence state .",
    "the same holds for sm@xmath39 and in particular sm@xmath40 .",
    "sm@xmath40 actually has several electronic configurations that are all within 10 - 100  mev .",
    "unfortunately the accuracy of the valence stability calculations used in this study is approaching these energy differences .",
    "therefore a mixed valence situation for both tm and sm clusters may very well be a reality for carefully chosen cluster sizes .",
    "this holds even more true at finite temperatures , where mixed valency becomes more favorable due to its larger entropy .",
    "an experimental investigation of this prediction would be highly interesting and could potentially also shine light into the finer details of mixed valency .",
    "the decisive property of mixed valence systems  @xcite is that ` fast ' physical measurements ( with characteristic times faster than , roughly , @xmath49 s ) give snapshots corresponding to a random static mixture of divalent and trivalent ions whereas ` slow ' ( or static ) measurements give the values average between typical for divalent and trivalent compounds .",
    "for example , the atomic volume of mixed valence compounds are intermediate between the values typical for isostructural compounds of divalent and trivalent elements . at the same time , ` fast ' core - level spectroscopy should give a mixture of the lines ( e.g. , l3 or l2 spectra ) corresponding to sm@xmath50 and sm@xmath51 ( or divalent and trivalent sm ) , and this seems to be the most convenient experimental way to probe the mixed valence state for the clusters .",
    "note that the difference between homogeneous and inhomogeneous mixed valence crucially important for the bulk @xcite is not well - defined for clusters where in general not all atoms have equivalent structural positions , a fact that may be utilized to shed light on finer details of mixed valence .",
