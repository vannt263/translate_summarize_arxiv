    "since the pioneering work of madelung and ewald,@xcite a huge amount of experimental and theoretical work has been devoted to alkali halides which are the simplest and most representative ionic solids .",
    "the interest in the high - pressure properties of these materials has been recently renewed by the introduction of the diamond anvil cell technology@xcite which has opened the way to exploring previously unaccessible portions of their phase diagram .",
    "csi is the softest among alkali halides and it has the smallest optical gap . for these reasons it is an ideal candidate to display a pressure - induced band - overlap metallization which is actually found at a pressure @xmath4.@xcite looking for this effect , new and unexpected crystal phases have been found to be stable in the pressure range of a few tens gpa .",
    "the first systematic studies of the high - pressure phases of cesium halides date back to 1984 . from energy - dispersive x - ray diffraction experiments huang _ et al._@xcite and knittle _",
    "et al._@xcite were able to observe that csi and csbr ( whose low - pressure stable phase is the cubic b2 ) , undergo a transition which lowers their cubic symmetry when an applied pressure reduces their residual volume to @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the equilibrium volume .",
    "the observed transition pressures are of @xmath7 and 53  gpa for csi and csbr respectively.@xcite a similar instability has been also reported in cscl , at about 65 gpa.@xcite this symmetry lowering manifests itself through the splitting of the ( 110 ) x - ray diffraction line into two peaks which are interpreted as corresponding to the ( 101 ) and ( 110 ) inequivalent reciprocal - lattice vectors of a tetragonal structure .",
    "these authors did not observe any detectable discontinuity in any physical observable , and they conjectured therefore that the phase transition was of second order .",
    "however , general group - theoretical considerations indicate that a transition from a cubic to a tetragonal phase in which the only order parameter is the unit cell shape , _ i.e. _ strain , can not be of second order.@xcite we conclude therefore that a weak first - order character of the transition must have escaped the analysis of the experimental data .",
    "claims that this tetragonal phase would undergo a further transition to an orthorhombic structure@xcite ( space group @xmath8 ) were not confirmed by subsequent theoretical work@xcite .",
    "the first - order character of the cubic - to - tetragonal transition in cesium halides was confirmed by the very first theoretical investigations performed by vohra _",
    "et al._@xcite within a born - meyer semiempirical approach . according to these authors ,",
    "the instability of the cscl crystal structure is related to the softening of the shear constant , @xmath9 , due to the competition between the long - range coulomb attraction and the short - range repulsive energy which becomes more and more important as the pressure increases .",
    "they also found that the tetragonal structure is stable against further orthorhombic distortions of symmetry corresponding to the space group @xmath8 ; i.e. , for any given value of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the minimum of the lattice energy was always found at @xmath12 in the whole pressure range explored .",
    "some investigations on csi have also been carried out from first principles .",
    "the work of christensen and satpathy@xcite  performed within the linear muffin - tin orbital approximation  and that of baroni and giannozzi@xcite  in which ab - initio pseudopotentials were used  confirmed the overall picture proposed by vohra _ et al_.@xcite .    in 1989 ,",
    "new and unexpected features emerged from the x - ray diffraction experiments performed by mao _",
    "@xcite on csi .",
    "using a sophisticated experimental set - up based on a synchrotron radiation source , they were able to identify a distortion of csi from the cubic b2 to the hexagonal closed - packed structure passing through an intermediate orthorhombic phase whose assigned symmetry ( @xmath13 ) , however is different from that guessed in ref . .",
    "it was observed that the ( 110 ) peak splits into three components , whereas two additional lines appear on the low- and high - energy sides of the triplet , corresponding to two diffraction peaks which are forbidden in the b2 structure .",
    "this diffraction pattern can be explained by assuming a @xmath14 reconstruction of the cubic cell characterized by the gliding of one ( 110 ) plane , as depicted in fig .",
    "the onset of the phase transition , characterized by the broadening of the diffraction lines of the cubic structure , is observed at pressures as low as 15  gpa .",
    "the observed splittings and peak intensities evolve continuously from 15 to 100  gpa , showing a single orthorhombic phase with variable parameters .",
    "however , below 45  gpa the splittings are not large enough to allow an unequivocal identification of the orthorhombic structure the transition from the cubic to the orthorhombic phase was observed to be continuous within the experimental resolution .    in a recent paper@xcite",
    "we have shown that the distortion leading to the orthorhombic structure observed by mao _ et al._@xcite is driven by the softening of an @xmath15 phonon at the @xmath1 point of the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "this softening is related to the ferroelastic instability responsible for the previously assumed cubic - to - tetragonal transition .",
    "the shear constant is in fact proportional to the square of the sound velocity along the @xmath16 direction for vibrations polarized along @xmath17 .",
    "this observation suggests that a large reduction of the magnitude of the shear constant could favour the softening of a transverse phonon along the ( 110 ) direction .",
    "in fact , the gliding of the ( 110 ) plane depicted in fig . 1 represents a lattice distortion which is very similar ( but not strictly equal ) to one of the two degenerate ionic displacement patterns of the @xmath15 acoustic phonon mode .",
    "we are thus led to identify the amplitude of this mode as the order parameter of the transition , in landau s sense .",
    "in this paper we present a complete account of our previous work on the high - pressure phases of csi,@xcite and its extension to other cesium halides , csbr and cscl .",
    "our approach is based on a combined use of the landau theory of phase transitions to classify the possible low - symmetry phases and to determine the form of the interactions which can lead to them , and on first - principles calculations of the relevant interaction constants and energy differences as functions of the applied pressure .",
    "our calculations are based on density - functional theory to determine crystal energies and their first derivatives with respect to atomic displacements ( forces ) and macroscopic strain ( stress ) , and on density - functional perturbation theory to determine the second derivatives ( essentially , the phonon frequencies ) . in sec .",

    "iv contains the conclusions .",
    "in the landau theory of phase transitions , the relevant thermodynamical potential , @xmath18 , describing the relative stability of two phases is expressed as a power series of the so called order parameter , @xmath19 , whose value is different from zero in the low - symmetry ( high - pressure , in the present case ) phase , while @xmath19 vanishes in the high - symmetry ( low - pressure ) phase : @xmath20 where the linear term in @xmath19 is missing to ensure the stability of the low - pressure phase . let us suppose for the moment that the fourth - order coefficient , @xmath21 , is positive so that it can ensure the global stability of the system , and let us neglect all higher - order terms . if @xmath22 , the relative stability of the low- and high - symmetry phases is determined by the sign of the discriminant @xmath23 . if @xmath24 the high - symmetry ( @xmath25 ) phase is stable , while for @xmath26 eq .",

    "the high- or low - symmetry phases are stable according to whether the second - order coefficient , @xmath29 , is positive or negative .",
    "suppose now that @xmath21 is negative in the region of the phase diagram where @xmath29 softens and that @xmath30 . in this case",
    ", the global stability of the system must be ensured by the sixth- and higher - order terms and a first - order transition to the low - symmetry phase would then occur when @xmath31 .    for structural transitions where the order parameter is the amplitude of a lattice distortion ,",
    "@xmath29 is essentially the square of the phonon frequency associated to that distortion . in the present case ,",
    "the phonon which goes soft is the @xmath15 mode at the @xmath1 point of the bz .",
    "the small group of the @xmath1 point  whose coordinates are @xmath32is @xmath33 and its star is made of three equivalent points .",
    "@xmath34 transforms according to a doubly degenerate irreducible representation of @xmath33 , so that the order parameter associated with this mode is six - dimensional : @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath15 representation is odd with respect to inversion , so that no third - order ( or , more generally , odd - order ) terms must be present in eq .",
    "( 1 ) in order to ensure invariance with respect to the ( cubic ) symmetry group of the low - pressure phase . following landau s argument",
    ", we conclude that @xmath36 , and @xmath30 . assuming that the sixth- and higher - order terms in eq .",
    "( 1 ) are positive in the neighborhood of the transition , this is then first- or second - order , according to whether the fourth - order coefficient is negative or positive , respectively .      in this paper",
    "we will ignore any entropy effects and restrict ourselves to zero temperature . in this condition",
    ", the implementation of the above phenomenological scheme requires the knowledge of the system energy as a function of the atomic displacements ( phonon amplitudes ) and unit - cell distortions ( strain ) . density - functional theory ( dft )",
    "is a very reliable and computationally viable tool for the study of the energetics of simple materials .",
    "we refer the reader to the many available review papers on this subject@xcite and we summarize here the main points . the local - density approximation ( lda ) to dft",
    "provides a practical , though approximate , way to map the ground - state properties of a system of interacting electrons onto those of a system of noninteracting electrons , subject to an effective external field which depends self - consistently on the ground - state electronic density .",
    "dft - lda allows to calculate in a rather accurate and efficient way the energies of materials within the born - oppenheimer approximation , along with their first derivatives with respect to external parameters , such as e.g. nuclear coordinates ( i.e. atomic forces)@xcite and unit - cell shape and volume ( i.e. stress).@xcite by linearizing the dft - lda equations with respect to the strenght of an external perturbation , the second derivatives of the energy can be conveniently obtained by solving a suitable set of linear equations.@xcite this is the essence of the density - functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) approach to lattice dynamics , which we will employ to determine the phonon spectra of the system considered , as functions of the crystal volume , i.e. of the applied pressure .",
    "our calculations are performed in the framework of the plane - wave pseudopotential method.@xcite for cs and i we have used the same pseudopotentials as in ref . .",
    "pseudopotentials for br and cl have been generated using the method originally proposed by von barth and car.@xcite for cs , electrons up to @xmath37 have been treated as frozen in the core .",
    "the inclusion of the cs @xmath38 and @xmath39 states into the valence shell is necessary to obtain sensible results .",
    "in fact we found that a cs pseudopotential which sustains only the @xmath40 electron as a valence electron yields a monotonic decrease of the crystal energy at decreasing volume , with no stability at all . an explicit account for the non - linear core - corrections,@xcite suggested by the large size of the cs core , does not substantially improve the results .",
    "the inclusion of cs @xmath38 and @xmath39 orbitals in the valence does not increase dramatically the numerical burden .",
    "in fact , the spatial extension of these orbitals is comparable to those of the anion @xmath41 and @xmath42 valence wavefunctions , so that the plane - wave basis set necessary to describe the latter is also adequate for the former .",
    "plane waves up to a kinetic energy cutoff of 25 ry were included in the basis set .",
    "the electron - gas exchange - correlation energy and potential used to implement lda are those determined by ceperley and alder @xcite as interpolated by perdew and zunger.@xcite brillouin - zone integrations have been performed using sets of special points corresponding to the ( 666 ) monkhorst - pack mesh.@xcite this mesh  which corresponds to 10 , 12 , and 24 points in the cubic , tetragonal , and orthorombic structures respectively  has been explicitly checked for convergence for all the relevant structural properties of interest here .",
    "the low - pressure structural properties of the materials investigated have been determined by fitting the calculated crystal energies to the murnaghan equation of state.@xcite dfpt allows a straightforward determination of the electronic contribution to the static dielectric constants and born effective charges.@xcite the theoretical predictions for these data are compared with experiments in table [ t : parret ] .",
    "the resulting accuracy on the predicted equilibrium lattice constants and bulk moduli is of the order of @xmath43 and 10% respectively ,",
    "i.e. in the typical range of dft - lda calculations .",
    "dielectric constants are systematically overestimated by @xmath44 , a well known drawback of the lda.@xcite using the theoretically determined equilibrium lattice parameters , the phonon dispersions of the three salts have been calculated by dfpt along the main symmetry directions . in fig .",
    "[ f : fig2 ] we display the calculated dispersion of csi and compare them with neutron - diffraction data . selected frequencies for csi , csbr , and cscl are reported and compared with experiments in table [ t : phonon ] .",
    "the agreement is quite satisfactory and gives us confidence in the predictive power of our calculations .      in order to substantiate the hypothesis of a mode softening occurring upon increasing pressure along the ( 110 ) acoustic branch ,",
    "we have calculated the corresponding phonon dispersion for several values of the crystal residual volume , @xmath45 . in fig .",
    "[ f : fig3 ] we display our results for csi .",
    "the @xmath34 acoustic phonon softens at @xmath46 , corresponding to a pressure @xmath47 , as a consequence of the incipient softening of the sound velocity of one of the transverse branches .",
    "the same behavior is observed in csbr at @xmath48 while cscl does not display any tendency to softening upon increasing pressure .",

    "the existence of a first - order transition is clearly visible with a second minimum occurring at @xmath49 above some critical pressure , @xmath50 , and separated from the high - simmetry phase by a well defined enthalpy barrier .",
    "the transition pressures are @xmath51 and @xmath52 gpa for csi and csbr respectively , with a very small volume discontinuity ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively ) . in fig .",
    "[ f : tet2 ] we report the @xmath11 parameter _ vs. _ @xmath55 for csi and csbr . in cscl",
    "the stability of the low - simmetry phase can not be unambiguously established within our present accuracy .",
    "an instability towards the tetragonal phase is signalled by the flatness of the enthalpy as a function of @xmath11 for pressures @xmath56 . at higher pressures",
    ", however , this instability seems to weaken , and calculations for pressures as high as 100 gpa do not give any evidence of a stable tetragonal phase .      as we have seen in sec .",
    "iia , the vanishing of the @xmath15 phonon frequency signals the onset of a phase transition whose order parameter is the phonon amplitude and which can be second - order because no third - order terms are present in the expansion of the crystal energy in powers of the order parameter . in order to investigate the character of the transition and",
    "determine the possible low - symmetry phases , it is necessary to find out the expression of the crystal energy in powers of @xmath19 to the lowest meaningful order , i.e. @xmath57 . in table",
    "[ t : phonq ] we display the wavevectors and the polarizations corresponding to one possible choice for the components of the six - dimensional order parameter .",
    "the corresponding fourth - order invariant polynomials can be obtained by using standard group theoretical techniques .",
    "the @xmath19 s realize an irreducible representation of the symmetry group of the high - symmetry phase ( space group @xmath58 ) .",
    "the number of fourth - order invariants is equal to the number of times the identical representation of @xmath59 is contained in the symmetric part of @xmath60 ^ 4 $ ] .",
    "a simple exercise shows that this number is equal to four .",
    "a straightforward way to obtain them is to symmetrize all the possible translationally invariant fourth - order monomials with respect to @xmath59 . in order to satisfy translational invariance , the starting monomials ,",
    "@xmath61 must satisfy the relation : @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the wavevector associated to the @xmath64-th component of the order parameter , and * g * is a reciprocal - lattice vector of the cubic phase .",
    "the four independent invariants are summarized in table [ t : inv ] .",
    "the resulting expansion of the crystal energy reads : @xmath65    the possible low - symmetry stable phases compatible with this expression for the crystal energy have been worked out in ref . .",
    "following the notation of ref . , these stable phases can be classified as in table [ t : p ] , where each configuration corresponds to a particular direction in the six - dimensional order parameter space , _ i.e. _ to a particular combination of phonon displacements . in the specific case of csi , the four fourth - order coefficients appearing in eq .",
    "( 2 ) have been fitted to the results of dft - lda calculations performed for lattice distortions along some of the order - parameter directions listed in table [ t : p ] .",
    "in fact , the coefficients of the crystal energy expansion are easily obtained through total energy and stress calculations . with the numerical values so obtained ,",
    "we have verified that at the crystal volume where the @xmath15 phonon frequency softens , the only minimum of the energy given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) occurs along the @xmath66 direction , whereas directional minima along all the other directions are actually saddle points .",
    "this observation seems to suggest that a second - order transition to a phase of tetrahedral symmetry ( @xmath67 ) would occur at the softening pressure of the @xmath15 phonon .",
    "this finding is at variance with experimental data which indicate that the high - pressure phase has an orthorhombic symmetry , compatible with a distortion along the @xmath68 line .",
    "the above considerations hold in the hypothesis that the strain state of the crystal is constant across the transition , except for the isotropic compression due to the application of a hydrostatic pressure .",
    "we have seen , however , that the softening of the @xmath15 phonon mode is closely related to the softening of the shear constant of the crystal , so that a strong coupling between the soft mode and macroscopic strain ( i.e. , between zone - center and zone - border acoustic phonons ) is to be expected .",
    "let us consider now the expression of the landau crystal energy up to fourth order in the phonon amplitude , including the coupling with the anisotropic components of the strain tensor , @xmath69 : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a polynomial in @xmath19 and the components of the strain tensor containing all the possible products up to the fourth order : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "all odd terms in @xmath19 must vanish by symmetry .",

    "there are nine such monomials which realize a reducible representation of the @xmath59 point group .",
    "the decomposition of this reducible representation into irreducible components is displayed in table [ t : irrep ] .",
    "the six independent components of the strain tensor split into three irreducible representation of the cubic group , as indicated in table [ t : irrep_strain ] .",
    "the desired invariants are finally obtained by coupling each irreducible representation from the @xmath80 set ( table [ t : irrep ] ) , with an equal irreducible representation from the @xmath69 set ( table [ t : irrep_strain ] ) , and listed in table [ t : inv_strain ] . the resulting expression for the crystal energy including",
    "the coupling with the strain reads : @xmath81 where @xmath82 are the elastic constants , @xmath83 components of the strain tensor , and the @xmath84 are the polynomials listed in table [ t : inv_strain ] .",
    "numerical values of the @xmath85 coefficients have been determined along lines similar to those used to determine the @xmath21 s .",
    "the @xmath66 minimum previously found to be stable ignoring the phonon - coupling strain is unaffected by such a coupling , while the minima along four out of the remaining six directions of table [ t : p ] are slightly modified , still maintaining the saddle - point character they had in absence of such a coupling .",
    "the coupling to the strain changes instead the character of the directional minima along @xmath68 and @xmath86 .",
    "let us consider the simpler case of the p1 minimum .",
    "projecting eq .",

    "( [ h_u_eps ] ) by the equilibrium condition @xmath96 , one obtains : @xmath97 @xmath98 eq . ( [ h_of_u ] ) shows that the coupling between the soft phonon and macroscopic strain renormalizes the fourth - order coefficient , making it large and _ negative _",
    ", whenever @xmath99 or @xmath100 are small enough . due to the ongoing softening of the shear constant , @xmath99 , we find that at the softening pressure the fourth - order coefficient is negative , and we conclude that the transition must then be first - order , occurring at a somewhat lower pressure ( see the discussion at the end of sec .",
    "a similar behaviour is observed along p2 .",
    "a thorough study of the transition might be performed by considering the expansion of the crystal energy up to sixth order in the order parameter , and by fitting the relevant coefficients to first - principles calculations , as it was done when the coupling to the strain was neglected .",
    "however the presence of many sixth - order invariants and the smallness of the computed energy differences make such a procedure unpractical .",
    "we have preferred instead to concentrate on the @xmath68 line which is geometrically simpler and whose symmetry is compatible with the observed x - ray diffraction pattern of the high - pressure phase .",
    "for this direction we have performed straight energy minimizations with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath69 . by repeating such a minimization for different volumes ,",
    "one directly obtains the equation of state of the crystal in the low - symmetry phase .",
    "csi and csbr both display a softening of the @xmath15 phonon frequency and the ferroelastic instability responsible for the cubic - to - tetragonal transition , whereas cscl does not show any tendency to phonon softening and a very weak tendency towards the ferroelastic instability .",
    "we conclude that the high - pressure stable phase of cscl in the pressure range up to @xmath101 is cubic b2 , whereas the relative stability of the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases must be checked for csbr .",

    "the volume discontinuity is however very weak ( @xmath102 ) and it is not visible on the scale of the figure .",
    "note also the different magnitude of cesium and iodine displacements and the weak dependence of @xmath103 upon applied pressure .",
    "the different behavior of @xmath104 and @xmath105 with respect to pressure is due to the fact that the former is inversely proportional to the nearly vanishing shear constant , @xmath99 , whereas the latter depends on @xmath100 which is regular in this pressure range .",
    "we remark that , due to the different amplitude of cs and i displacements in the unit cell , the space group of our final structure is @xmath106 , different from the @xmath13 originally proposed by mao _ et al .",
    "however , the diffraction pattern corresponding to the two groups is the same , and our proposed structure is compatible with the experimental data .",

    "in this paper we have shown that a combined use of the landau theory of phase transitions and accurate first - principles calculations based of dft - lda provide a reliable scheme for predicting the structural properties of ionic systems at high pressures . in the specific case of cesium halides , we have observed a trend in the high - pressure phases which can be related with the polarizability of the anion .",
    "our results indicate that the more polarizable is the anion the larger is the tendency towards a tetragonal instability of the cubic b2 structure ( passing from cscl to csbr ) and , for even larger polarizability towards an orthorombic structure ( from csbr to csi ) .",

    "<S> a cubic - to - orthorhombic transition , driven by the softening of an acoustic phonon at the @xmath1 point of the brillouin zone , is competing with the cubic - to - tetragonal martensitic transition typical of these compounds . </S>",
    "<S> the phonon softening takes place only in csi and csbr at a residual volume of @xmath2=0.64 , 0.52 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> a cubic - to - tetragonal instability is found instead to occur at @xmath3 for all the compounds considered here . </S>",
    "<S> the orthorhombic phase is stable only in csi , whereas it is taken over by the tetragonal one in the case of csbr . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis reveals the essential role played by the phonon - strain coupling in stabilizing the orthorhombic phase and in making the corresponding transition first - order . </S>"
