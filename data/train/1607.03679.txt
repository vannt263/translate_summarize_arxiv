    "numerical chemical evolution models ( cems ) are one of the most flexible ( and long - standing ) tools for interpreting the distribution of metals in both the gas and stellar phases of galaxies .",
    "the power of cems lies in the rapid and efficient coupling of star formation and feedback prescriptions , with the stellar nucleosynthesis , initial mass function formalisms , and treatments of gas infall / outflow .",
    "while lacking a self - consistent ( hydro-)dynamical treatment , the ability to explore these parameter spaces on computing timescales of minutes rather than months , ensures cems maintain a prominent role in astrophysics today .",
    "the initial motivation for the development of cems was the identification of what is now known as the _ g - dwarf problem _",
    "@xcite ; specifically , there is an apparent paucity of metal - poor stars in the solar neighbourhood , relative to the number predicted to exist should the region behave as a ` closed - box ' , i.e. one in which gas neither enters nor departs .",
    "it was recognised that a viable solution to the g - dwarf problem lay in the relaxation of this closed - box assumption , via the inclusion of a gas infall prescription @xcite .",
    "the infall of metal - poor gas can then dilute the existing elemental abundances , whilst simultaneously increasing the early star formation rate , thus producing a stellar metallicity distribution shifted to moderately higher metallicities .",
    "moreover the star formation sustained by metal - poor gas accretion self - regulates to produce a constant gas - phase metallicity close to the stellar yield ( i.e. , close to the solar metallicity ) .",
    "the g - dwarf problem also appears in external galaxies , as m  31 @xcite .",
    "building on this framework , most classical models of disc formation assume a protogalaxy or dark matter halo which acts as the the source of the infalling gas @xcite without which , in addition , radial abundance gradients are increasingly difficult to recover",
    ".    extensions of this classical framework include those employing a multiphase representation for the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , we calculated a generic grid of theoretical cems , defined in terms of their rotation velocity using the universal rotation curve of @xcite . in that work we assumed that the infall rate , or its inverse , the collapse time - scale , @xmath0 , for each galaxy , depends on the total mass of each theoretical galaxy , with the low mass galaxies forming on a longer time scale than the massive ones , according to the expression @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "such a mass - dependency mimics the downsizing phenomenon now associated with galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "these sorts of adopted timescale relationships are , however , weakly constrained in the sense that they were only implemented to ensure present - day abundance patterns and gas fractions were recovered .",
    "we now possess much more information pertaining to the manner by which gas moves from the cosmic web , through halos , and onto discs , and so more realistic prescriptions should be pursued .    from the observational point of view ,",
    "the observations of the atomic hydrogen line hi  at 21  cm in nearby galaxies revealed the existence of extensive halos containing gas up to 15kpc above the plane of the discs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this gas could be deposited on the discs , forming at present the reservoirs from which stars form in the outer parts of galaxies .",
    "in fact , it seems be rotating slower than in discs and moving slowly toward inwards @xcite . however , most of observational evidences of gas accretion are indirect , since this gas is tenuous . only the high velocity clouds",
    "( hvc ) are well studied ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their existence being in agreement with theoretical expectations . @xcite analyzed the hvcs in the local intergalactic medium suggesting , in agreement with previous findings from @xcite , that these hvc s are the building blocks of galaxies , and situated within the halo at galactocentric distances less than @xmath240  kpc , consistent with the predictions of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "these clouds are comprised of low - metallicity gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , consistent with the material being the fuel out of which the disc forms .",
    "it should also be noted that there now exists recent observations which suggest the infall of low - metallicity hi  gas in dwarf galaxies triggering star formation therein .",
    "the most prominent example is ngc  5253 , but additional examples are described by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite estimated that , if bumps of hi  gas have a total mass of order 10@xmath3 and are accreted in 10@xmath4yr , the typical accretion rate would be @xmath21m@xmath5yr@xmath6 .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite , reviewing all data referring this subject of gas around galaxies and its possible movement towards them , infer a mean visible accretion rate of cold gas of at least 0.2m@xmath5yr@xmath6 , which should be considered a lower limit of the infall rate ; such a value poses a problem when it compared with the star formation rate ( sfr ) , since it is roughly one order of magnitude smaller than necessary to sustain the observed sfr ( see * ? ? ? * , and references therein ) .",
    "the @xcite value is , however , calculated using only the cold gas , neglecting the likely more dominant background reservoir of ionised gas .",
    "@xcite measuring the mass of this phase , estimating the infall rate increases to @xmath7m@xmath5yr@xmath6 .",
    "later , @xcite gives an infall rate of 0.50.7m@xmath5yr@xmath6  as an estimate for the milky way galaxy ( mwg ) and the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) within a radius of 50kpc , claiming that ` in mwg and other nearby galaxies the infall of neutral gas may be observed directly by hi  21  cm observations of extra - planar gas clouds that move through the halos ' .",
    "very recently , @xcite report the hi 21-cm detection in emission at a redshift @xmath8 with the cosmos hi large extragalactic survey ( chiles ) .",
    "following these data , the diffuse gas is m(hi)=2@xmath910@xmath10m@xmath5 , the molecular one is m(h@xmath11)=1.89.9@xmath910@xmath10m@xmath5 , and the stellar mass m@xmath12=8.7@xmath910@xmath10m@xmath5 .",
    "this implies that the disc of this galaxy accreted [ 1322]@xmath910@xmath10m@xmath5 in @xmath28gyr , which will produce an averaged value for the infall rate of 1727m@xmath5yr@xmath6 .",
    "although these numbers are highly speculative , given the lack of any more firm estimates , we will employ them in this work .",
    "additional guidance regarding infall rates can be provided by tracing the spatial and temporal infall of gas onto discs , via the use of cosmological simulations .",
    "this cosmological gas supply has a strong dependence on redshift and halo mass .",
    "however , the interplay between the circumgalactic gas components is not well known and the gas physics in a turbulent multiphase medium is non - trivial to capture in ( relatively ) low - resolution hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "the consequence is that there remain only select examples in the literature which reproduce successfully and simultaneously ( both in terms of size and relative proportions ) the characteristics of late - type discs and their spheroids ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "bearing in mind this cautionary statement , it is interesting to note that these simulations suggest that most of the baryons in galaxies are accreted diffusely , with roughly 3/4 due to smooth accretion , and 1/4 from mergers .",
    "recently , @xcite have generated a suite of cosmological simulations which reproduce the gross characteristics of the local group .",
    "analysing these simulations , they find the relationship between the stellar mass and the halo mass ( their fig .  2 and eq .",
    "2 ) , valid for a stellar mass range [ @xmath13 m@xmath5 . in the last decade",
    ", several techniques have been developed to obtain such a relation between the dynamical mass in the proto - halos and the baryonic mass in the discs , although usually this last one is associated to the stellar mass .",
    "one of these statistical approaches connecting the cdm halos with their galaxies is the sub - halo abundance matching technique . with that , the total stellar to halo mass relation ( shmr )",
    "is obtained @xcite .",
    "other formalisms use the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) , which specifies the probability that a halo of mass @xmath14 has a given number of galaxies with a certain mass @xmath15 ( or luminosity , colour or type ) . as a result",
    ", the shmr is also estimated @xcite .",
    "a summary of these results can be found in fig.5 of @xcite .",
    "this relation constrains the possible accretion of gas from the halo to the discs .",
    "one of the questions that arises when cosmological simulations and data are compared is , such as @xcite states , that there is a collision between the cuspy central density seen in cosmological simulations and the observational evidence that galaxies have flat cores .",
    "this tension there exists from some years ago and it is still present .",
    "the use of a navarro , frank & white ( nfw ) profile , with its @xmath16 producing cusps at small radii , comes from the era in which cosmological simulations were undertaken primarily only with dark matter , but it continues be widely used . over the past years the data for rotation curves have improved immensely , as well as the mass modeling , showing that most of dwarf disc galaxies have cored halos .",
    "although it seemed less clear for giant spirals , @xcite analyzed rotation curves ( rcs ) for a sample of 1000 galaxies finding a good fit of a core - halo profile to the data , better than the one for the nfw .",
    "more recently , @xcite have carefully analyzed the available data for the milky way galaxy , fitting both dark matter burkert and nfw profiles .",
    "they find that the cored profile produces the best result , and is therefore the preferred one , claiming that this is in agreement with similar fits obtained for other external disc galaxies and in agreement with the mass model underlying the universal rotation curve ( urc ) . @xcite and @xcite say that this discrepancy between observations and simulations may be due to dynamical processes that transform a cuspy into a cored model , probably by the effect of the feedback that modifies the star formation process at small scale .",
    "in fact , most recent cosmological simulations ( see * ? ? ? * ) which include this feedback in the star formation prescriptions , find that this transformation occurs when there is violent feedback from rapid star formation in the inner regions of disc galaxies . in this work we use the (",
    "* hereinafter sal07 ) expressions , who use the urc formalism assuming that halo distributions follow a burkert core isothermal profile .    in the present work",
    "we compute the infall rate for a set of theoretical galaxies with total dynamical masses in the range @xmath17@xmath18 $ ] m@xmath5 . following the prescriptions of sal07 ,",
    "we derive the rotation curves for each halo and disc , and their corresponding radial mass distributions . by imposing that gas from the halo",
    "falls onto the discs at a rate such that after a hubble time the systems end with masses as observed in nature , we obtain the infall rate for each galaxy and for each radial region therein .",
    "we analyse the infall rate resulting from these prescriptions , comparing with the results from assumptions of previous cems , those inferred from cosmological simulations , and those from extant empirical data concerning mass accretion .",
    "we pay special attention to the redshift evolution of this infall in galaxies of different dynamical masses , and analyse its radial dependency within individual galaxies .",
    "we verify that the final halo - disc mass relation follows the prescriptions given by the authors cited above .",
    "the chemical evolution is beyond the scope of this work ; here , we focus specifically on the manner by which gas reaches the disc .",
    "the impact on star formation and metal enrichment is the focus of the next phase of our collaboration ( moll et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we describe the framework of our models in section  [ model ] .",
    "the results are outlined in section  [ results ] , sub - dividing the study of the dependence of the infall rate on the galactocentric radius into sub - section  [ dep - r ] , the dependence on mass of the whole galaxies into sub - section  [ dep - m ] , and the resulting growth of the spiral discs into sub - section  [ mdisc ] .",

    "[ infall - r ] , a clear dependence of the gas infall rate on redshift , and also on radius , appears except for the outer disc regions where the infall rate is almost constant in spite of redshift variations . at the inner disc regions and the bulge , however , the cold gas accretion is higher at high redshifts than now .",
    "this cold gas accretion in the inner regions of high - redshift galaxies is supported by observations : @xcite find that a massive infall of gas in the central regions of high - redshift galaxies ( @xmath117 ) is needed to explain the gas metallicity distribution within these galaxies . in the local universe",
    "there is also evidence that there still exists cold gas accretion in disc galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this new result is in agreement with surveys of extended uv discs around both early- and late - type galaxies in the local universe that suggest gas accretion in their outer parts @xcite .",
    "in fact , these latter authors establish that gas - rich galaxies below a stellar mass of @xmath119msun  display uv - bright discs , supporting an active disc growth .",
    "this limit is basically the value in which @xmath120 in our models , as seen in table 1 , between models 4 and 5 .",
    "this limit in the collapse timescale also appears when considering the different radial regions within discs , thus suggesting that these discs may continue growing at the present time even in the most massive galaxies .",
    "another important result that we have obtained is the dependence on redshift of the infall rate normalised to the disc mass in each time - step for different @xmath17 , shown in fig .",
    "[ infall - masa ] .",
    "the gas accretion profile is similar for all simulated galaxies at @xmath121 , and only for lower redshifts does the infall rate depend on @xmath17 .",
    "this has important implications for how discs grow their masses at high redshifts .",
    "since galaxies form and evolve by accreting gas from their surroundings , our models suggest that the accretion of gas is similar for spiral galaxies , regardless of their masses .",
    "@xcite showed that cold mode accretion via filaments is responsible for the supply of gas in galaxies .",
    "@xcite showed that the gas is accreted via filaments from the intergalactic medium and these filaments can condense into clouds and provide gas for star formation .",
    "these clouds may be analogs of hvcs surrounding the mwg which are thought to provide the fuel for star formation in the galaxy .",
    "therefore , the similarity between the accretion rates found here for spiral galaxies with different @xmath17  suggests an analogous disc growth for these galaxies and , consequently , similar disc properties .",
    "we will analyse these properties , as the possible formation of stars in the outer regions of discs or the variations of radial gradients of abundances , in a future work ( moll et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "therein , we will take into account the star formation processes and the consequent metal enrichment , not included yet here , when the chemical evolution computed is computed self - consistently .",
    "in this work we have presented the infall rates used as input to a grid of chemical models for spiral galaxies .",
    "we also performed a systematic comparison with data and competing models in the literature , including cosmological simulations .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the more massive the galaxy , the higher the absolute value of the infall rate at all redshifts .",
    "2 .   the infall rates necessary to reproduce the relationship between @xmath17@xmath122 are smoother than the ones assumed in classical chemical evolution models , including our earlier generation of models ( md05 ) .",
    "they are also lower and smoother than the accretion rates produced in cosmological simulations which create spheroids and are in better agreement with those resulting in realistic late - type discs ( employing contemporary prescriptions for star formation and feedback ) .",
    "the evolution of the infall rate with redshift is quite constant for discs , decreasing smoothly for @xmath123 and showing very similar behaviour for all radial regions , with differences only in the absolute value .",
    "this smooth evolution is different than the steep decline with redshift shown for bulges .",
    "the normalised infall rate is essentially the same for all discs until @xmath80 , and shows only small differences for @xmath124 .",
    "the final relationship among disc and halo masses , denoted as shmr , obtained by these new prescriptions , agrees well with observations and cosmological simulations .",
    "6 .   from redshift @xmath125 to today",
    ", discs grow in size by a factor of two ( except for the lowest mass galaxies ) , while the disc masses increase by a factor of five to ten .",
