    "the layered cobaltates na@xmath9coo@xmath1 are well known for their ionic mobility@xcite . recently ,",
    "their electronic properties have attracted much interest due to the discovery of superconductivity when water is intercalated@xcite .",
    "the co ions form a triangular lattice in the coo@xmath1 planes , which are separated by na@xmath10 ions . with varying na@xmath10 content @xmath11 , the valence of co ions can be tuned from co@xmath12 ( low spin @xmath13 ) to co@xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "analogy to the high transition - temperature cuprate superconductors has been drawn , since na@xmath9coo@xmath1 may be regarded as doping a @xmath13 mott insulator on a triangular lattice@xcite . however , the na@xmath10 layers serve not only as charge reservoirs .",
    "order of na@xmath10 ions at specific concentrations dramatically affect electronic properties , such as the insulating state at @xmath11=0.5 sandwiched by metallic states at lower and higher dopings@xcite .",
    "additionally , the valence of co ions in the hydrated superconductor na@xmath16coo@xmath17h@xmath1o is suggested in recent studies to be close to + 3.5 rather than the apparent + 3.7 , caused by the isovalent exchange of the hydronium ion h@xmath18o@xmath10 and na@xmath10@xcite .",
    "hence , na@xmath9coo@xmath1 with @xmath11=0.5 instead of @xmath19 may be regarded as the parent compound of the hydrated superconductor .",
    "therefore , it is of particular interest to focus on na@xmath0coo@xmath1 .    a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) at @xmath20 k is clearly indicated in transport and infrared measurements of na@xmath0coo@xmath1@xcite .",
    "the transition is marked also by a depression in magnetic susceptibility .",
    "in addition , another anomaly in magnetic susceptibility occurs at @xmath21 k , where the spins form an alternating antiferromagnetic pattern in the coo@xmath1 plane@xcite and the hall coefficient abruptly changes sign@xcite .",
    "the mit has been explained as a consequence of charge ordering@xcite , and structure data from electron and neutron diffraction measurements have been explained by alternating co@xmath22 and co@xmath23 chains , decorated by an ordered na@xmath10 pattern which exists already at the room temperature@xcite .",
    "however , the charge segregation into co@xmath24 is disputed by a recent nmr study , and an alternative explanation of nesting of the fermi surface at the lower orthorhombic symmetry is provided@xcite .",
    "the nesting of the fermi surface is also used to explain the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments@xcite .",
    "the subtle relation between electronic , magnetic and structural properties also manifests in the restoration of the triangular symmetry of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 at high magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "although a link between na@xmath10 ordering , which breaks the triangular symmetry , and the phase - transitions at @xmath5 and @xmath25 in na@xmath0coo@xmath1 has been suggested through co charge segregation , the relation between structure and the successive transitions can not be unambiguously determined in the crystallography studies due to the limited sensitivity of the diffraction techniques@xcite .",
    "in addition , no anomaly in lattice dynamics has been reported at these transitions in na@xmath0coo@xmath1 . here",
    "we present polarized raman scattering measurements on single crystalline sample of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 from 8 to 305 k. phonon softening is observed below @xmath5 for both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes of the coo@xmath7 octahedra .",
    "simultaneously , the forbidden @xmath2 mode in the channel of cross polarization appears at @xmath5 .",
    "it indicates that the transition at @xmath5 is not only magnetic or electronic , but also involved with structural distortion of the coo@xmath7 octahedra .",
    "the distortion in the coo@xmath1 plane , instead of the orthorhombic na ordering at @xmath8 k@xcite , is more directly related to the phase transition probed in the nmr , arpes and neutron diffraction experiments at @xmath5 .",
    "single crystal samples of na@xmath26coo@xmath1 were grown using a traveling solvent floating - zone furnace .",
    "the as - grown crystal was cut into pieces with the dimensions of @xmath27@xmath28 mm@xmath29 and has a starting sodium concentration of about 0.75 . after the chemical deintercalation of na in solutions of i@xmath1 dissolved acetonitrile , the actual na concentration was determined to be @xmath11=0.5@xmath301% by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry . the detailed procedure for preparing",

    ", width=291 ]    the raman measurements were performed with a double - gratings monochromator ( jobin yvon u1000 ) .",
    "the detector is a back - illuminated ccd cooled by liquid nitrogen .",
    "an argon ion laser was used with an excitation wavelength of 514.5 nm .",

    "the polarization of light along the co - o bond orientation is denoted as x , and the perpendicular orientation in the coo@xmath1 plane as y. a standard calculation of the raman tensors shows that the in - plane @xmath3 mode of oxygen vibrations in the coo@xmath7 octahedra is allowed in both the xx and xy channels .",

    "are shown in fig .  2 .",

    "as the sample was cooled from the room temperature to @xmath5 , the phonon wavenumbers of both modes increase gradually .",
    "the increase can be understood naturally in terms of anharmonic effect which has also been reported previously@xcite .",
    "it includes two contributions : one from thermal expansion and the other from multi - phonon decay process@xcite .",
    "the contribution from thermal expansion can be written as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the zero - temperature phonon frequency , @xmath37 the grneisen constant , and @xmath38 the linear thermal expansion@xcite .",
    "neutron diffraction shows that the average in - plane @xmath38 is 16 ppm , whereas @xmath38 is 2540 ppm for the c - axis@xcite .",
    "since the @xmath3 ( @xmath2 ) phonon mode is related to the in - plane ( out - of - plane ) vibrations of oxygen atoms in the coo@xmath7 octahedra , the wavenumbers should be sensitive to the change of the in - plane bonds rather than the c - axis expansion .",
    "hence , the small in - plane @xmath38 would translate to a small anharmonic contribution from thermal expansion .     and @xmath2 phonon wavenumbers .",

    "( 1 ) for anharmonic effect , and phonon softening @xmath39 occurs below @xmath5.,width=302 ]    the main contribution to the shift of phonon wavenumbers above @xmath5 then can be reasonably attributed to multi - phonon decay process . for a three - phonon process",
    ", a raman optical phonon with the frequency of @xmath36 will decay into two phonons with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , where @xmath42 .",
    "the frequency shift by the process is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a material - dependent constant@xcite .",
    "klemens has considered the decay channels through acoustic phonons which fulfill the condition @xmath45@xcite . in many cases ,",
    "it offers a good approximation .",

    "the klemens model describes well our data above @xmath5 , and the values of @xmath44 are comparable with  13 @xmath32 deduced from diamond , and 2 to 4 @xmath32 for semiconducting materials such as aln , si , and gaas@xcite .    when the sample was cooled further , the first new discovery of this work is that both the @xmath3 and @xmath2 modes soften considerably below the @xmath5 , departing from the dotted curves from the anharmonic effect ( fig .",
    "the softening in frequency , @xmath47 , is taken as the difference between the dotted curve and measured data .",
    "it is scaled so that it has the same value at 8 k for both the @xmath3 and @xmath2 modes , and it follows the same function of temperature for both modes as shown in fig .  4 .     for the @xmath3 ( red triangles ) and @xmath2 ( cyan diamonds ) modes , and the integrated intensity of the `` forbidden '' @xmath2 mode in the xy channel ( black squares ) . for details on @xmath48",
    ", see text .",
    "the open green circles represent the squared magnetic order parameter @xmath49@xcite , and the filled blue circles the gap function at the fermi surface@xcite .",
    ", width=309 ]    since an antiferromagnetic transition occurs at @xmath5 , it is natural to consider the spin - phonon coupling . in a magnetic material mediated by the superexchange interaction @xmath50 , such as in magnetic insulators ,",
    "the @xmath50 would be modulated by the vibrating positions of ligands : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the instantaneous and equilibrium positions of oxygen , respectively , in our case .",
    "usually spin - phonon coupling is a second - order effect since the linear contribution is canceled out by the symmetric oscillation of ions around equilibrium positions .",
    "however , some local asymmetric structures would cause the linear part to be finite , such as the buckled cuo@xmath1 plane in yba@xmath1cu@xmath18o@xmath54@xcite . similarly , in na@xmath26coo@xmath1 , the oxygen and cobalt ions are not in the same plane .",
    "the oscillation of oxygen ions is expected to have a strong effect on magnetic interaction @xmath50 .",
    "the phonon softening due to the spin - phonon coupling can be expressed as@xcite @xmath55 where @xmath48 is the spin - phonon coupling coefficient , @xmath56 the average for adjacent spin pairs , and @xmath57 the squared magnetic order parameter . in evaluating @xmath58 in the last step of eq .",
    "( 3 ) , neutron diffraction result by gsparovi et al.@xcite was used . in fig .  4 , measured @xmath49 for na@xmath0coo@xmath1 ( open green circles)@xcite is compared with the scaled phonon softening for the @xmath3 ( red triangles ) and @xmath2 ( cyan diamonds ) modes . while both @xmath39 and @xmath49 appear below @xmath5 , the softening is slower and less mean - field - like than the squared magnetic order parameter , namely , the eq .",
    "( 3 ) is not perfectly followed .",
    "it is not clear whether this is due to na@xmath0coo@xmath1 not being an insulator above the 46 k metal - insulator transition .",
    "if one nevertheless applies eq .",
    "( 3 ) to na@xmath0coo@xmath1 at 8  k , which is then an insulator , the spin - phonon coupling coefficient @xmath48 is estimated as 30 @xmath32 for the @xmath2 mode and 41 @xmath32 for the @xmath3 mode , respectively . for comparison ,",
    "@xmath48 is @xmath5950 @xmath32 in cuo@xcite , 6 and 9 @xmath32 for two phonon modes in y@xmath1ru@xmath1o@xmath60@xcite , and @xmath61 is less than 3 @xmath32 for antiferromagnets in the rutile structure such as fef@xmath1 , mnf@xmath1 and nif@xmath1@xcite .",
    "thus , the spin - phonon coupling in na@xmath0coo@xmath1 is very strong .",
    "the spin - phonon coupling is a _ dynamical _ spin - lattice interaction . at a magnetic transition , _",
    "static _ spin - lattice interaction is also possible , which is usually referred to as magnetoelastic effect .",
    "the effect requires no phonon softening , but a static change of local structure . in addition to the phonon softening",
    ", the second new discovery of this work is that the @xmath2 mode in the `` forbidden '' xy channel also appears below @xmath5 in na@xmath0coo@xmath1 , see fig .",
    "the violation of the raman selection rules mentioned above for the triangular layers requires a structural distortion in the edge - shared coo@xmath7 to break lattice symmetry of the high temperature phase .",
    "qualitatively , the integrated intensity of the `` forbidden ''",
    "@xmath2 mode is proportional to the distortion at low temperatures . in fig .  4 ,",
    "the integrated intensity of the `` forbidden '' mode is plotted as the black squares .",
    "it follows the general trend of @xmath39 , except that there appears a dip around @xmath25 .",
    "however , more sensitive experiments are called for to establish the statistical significance of the dip .",
    "magnon scattering was suggested as the origin of the `` forbidden '' @xmath2 mode in view that the mode appears only below the magnetic transition .",
    "however , this explanation has difficulty for the same mode in the allowed xx channel at all measured temperatures .    in fig .  4 ,",
    "the single - particle gap function ( filled blue circles ) from the arpes measurements@xcite is also plotted .",
    "different from magnetic order parameter , it traces the phonon softening @xmath39 very well . on the other hand",
    ", the metal - insulator transition at @xmath25 has no detectable effect on either @xmath39 or the gap function .",
    "although the gap is opened only at the @xmath62 fermi surface of the co ions , the na ordering at @xmath8 k was invoked to provide a nesting condition for the fermi surface@xcite .",
    "but qian _ et al .",
    "_  also noticed that their observed gap is less anisotropic than expected from such a nesting scenario and that the gap size is rather soft compared to many cdw systems .",
    "in addition , the fermi surface geometry does not share the two - fold symmetry of the na supercell@xcite .",
    "thus , our observed structural transition directly involving coo@xmath7 at the same temperature offers a promising alternative mechanism for the band folding .",
    "similarly , the supercell needed for explanation of the nmr results at @xmath5@xcite may come instead from the distortion of the coo@xmath7 octahedra .",
    "we notice that electron diffraction experiments at 100 k detected from the na layers another tripled superlattice pattern which , however , disappears at 20 k@xcite . whether the tripled superlattice pattern has anything to do with our observed coo@xmath7 distortion , which persists down to our lowest measurement temperature at 8 k , is not obvious .",
    "in summary , our polarized raman measurements of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 single crystal have shed new light on the multiple phase transitions in the interesting material . above @xmath4 k ,",
    "only conventional anharmonic effect was observed .",
    "the softening of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 optical phonon modes was observed below @xmath5 , accompanied by the @xmath2 mode in the `` forbidden '' xy raman channel .",
    "our results indicate a structural transition at @xmath5 which breaks the local lattice symmetry of the coo@xmath7 octahedra .",
    "the spin - phonon coupling in na@xmath0coo@xmath1 is among the strongest of magnetic materials .",
    "the closely related order - parameters of the structural distortion and phonon softening in the coo@xmath7 layers as well as the magnetic and electronic transitions involving electrons of co ions suggests a common origin for these transitions . the structural condition for the nesting fermi surface scenario which was invoked as the mechanism for the magnetic transition and the partial gapping of the fermi surface at @xmath5 is more likely the structural distortion discovered in this work in the co layers than the orthorhombic na ordering at @xmath27350 k. if na@xmath0coo@xmath1 is indeed more appropriate as the parent compound of the superconducting na@xmath16coo@xmath17h@xmath1o@xcite , it may be difficult to exclude a lattice contribution to focus on a purely electronic superconducting mechanism .",
