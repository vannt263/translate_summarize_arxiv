    "helium has two stable isotopes : that of mass 4 is readily available as helium gas or liquid from the atmosphere or gas wells , while that of mass 3 is extremely rare in nature and only became available commercially in the 1950s @xcite .",
    "liquid @xmath0 is particularly suited to study correlation among the strongly interacting many - body fermionic systems .",
    "several approaches have been used for investigating the properties of normal liquid @xmath0 .",

    "the lowest order constrained variational ( locv ) method based on the cluster expansion of the energy functional has been used .",
    "this method is fully self - consistent , since it does not introduce any free parameter to the calculations .",
    "we have also used the locv method in many - body calculations of dense matter @xcite .",
