    "since the rise of graphene , a two - dimensional dirac semimetal , dirac fermions have been under intense focus in the last decade .",

    "_ in honeycomb lattice in a magnetic field ,  @xcite and by pardo and pickett in tio@xmath0/vo@xmath0 nanostructures by means of first principles calculations .",
    "@xcite this unexpected zero gap state shows a linear dispersion along one direction , while exhibiting quadratically dispersing bands along the orthogonal direction , thus the name : semi - dirac semimetal .",
    "interestingly , such a semi - dirac state has also been suggested in the hofstadter spectrum ,  @xcite as well as in a dielectric photonic crystal .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , the three - dimensional analogs of graphene , namely three - dimensional dirac semimetals were proposed theoretically .",
    "@xcite these semimetals exhibit linearly dispersing bands along all the three momentum directions and the fermi surface consists of discrete dirac points .",
    "recently a number of experiments have found their signatures by means of angle - resolved photoemission experiments ,  @xcite as well as by using landau level spectroscopy and quasiparticle interference .",
    "@xcite    interaction of light with dirac fermions is also an avenue that has seen extensive recent activity .",
    "application of light has been predicted to generate two - dimensional floquet topological insulators ,  @xcite while illuminating graphene and silicene with circularly polarized light is expected to generate a haldane - like mass gap .",
    "@xcite an exciting new development has been the observation of floquet - bloch bands and light - induced band gap on the surface of topological insulators . by applying intense ultrashort midinfrared pulses",
    "wang _ et al .",
    "_ were able to observe polarization dependent band gaps , using time- and angle - resolved photoemission technique .",
    "@xcite this opens up the possibility to realize optical control over topological phenomena .    in light of these promising developments , in this contribution , we study the effect of off - resonant circularly polarized light on two - dimensional semi - dirac semimetals , as well as three - dimensional dirac semimetals .",
    "our analytical results show that for semi - dirac semimetals circularly polarized light does not lead to any gap in the band structure in contrast to the well - studied dirac systems graphene and silicene . for three - dimensional case",
    "we find that illumination with light allows one to tune from a trivial insulator to a dirac semimetal with an inverted band gap .",
    "curiously , at the critical zero gap point during this topological transition , the band structure of the system is described by a three - dimensional semi - dirac semimetal hamiltonian .",
    "we show that illumination of light leads to exciting prospects for generating , manipulating , as well as annihilating dirac points .",
    "let us begin with the analysis of semi - dirac semimetal in two - dimensions under illumination by off - resonant light .",
    "the low - energy hamiltonian for a semi - dirac semimetal can be written as  @xcite    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the fermi velocity along the linear dispersion direction ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 is the mass along the direction with quadratic dispersion ( @xmath5 ) , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the @xmath8 and @xmath9 components of the triad of pauli matrices ( here and henceforth we have set @xmath10 )",
    ". consider illumination by circularly - polarized off - resonant light of frequency @xmath11 , which generates a vector potential @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 for right and left circularly polarized beams , respectively .",
    "the response of the electrons can be obtained by minimal coupling @xmath14 .",
    "if we consider low order virtual processes involving only a single photon , then the time - dependent hamiltonian can be approximated by  @xcite    @xmath15}{\\omega}.\\ ] ]    here @xmath16 are the fourier components of the full time - dependent hamiltonian , and @xmath17 is the time period of the incident light . here",
    "we note that the above is an appropriate treatment of out - of - equilibrium physics in the large - frequency limit , while the static limit is ill - defined .",
    "computing the fourier components of the hamiltonian and using the commutation relations for the pauli matrices , we obtain the commutator as @xmath18= -\\eta\\frac{e^{2}\\mathcal{a}^{2}k_{x}v_{f}}{m}\\sigma_{y}$ ] .",
    "then the effective hamiltonian in the presence of light can be written down as    @xmath19    in the above effective hamiltonian , we note the peculiar form of the additional term arising from the coupling to off - resonant light involving both the momentum , @xmath20 , along the quadratic dispersion direction , as well as the fermi velocity , @xmath2 , along the dirac - like dispersion . this arises as a consequence of the unusual semi - dirac dispersion .",
    "( left panel ) and @xmath21 ( right panel ) .",
    "note the gap opening for non - zero light intensity . here",
    "we set @xmath22 . ]",
    "the energy eigenvalues are obtained as @xmath23 .",
    "note that since @xmath24 , the left or right - handedness of the circularly polarized light does not influence the photon dressed band structure .",
    "the photon dressed band structure for the semi - dirac semimetal is shown in fig .",
    "[ 2d_semidirac_semimetal ] with @xmath25 and @xmath21 , along the quadratic and linear dispersion directions . in this case",
    "light illumination does not open a gap in the spectrum , although it does change the dispersion shape along @xmath20 .",
    "this is a result of the competition between the terms linear and quadratic in @xmath20 , i.e. , the terms proportional to @xmath26 and @xmath6 , respectively . increasing light intensity increases the linearity of the bands along this direction , while maintaining the linearity of bands in the orthogonal direction . in this way",
    "photoillumination allows a handle over the _ degree of diracness _ of the system .",
    "@xcite    it is illustrative to contrast the above obtained result with the case of purely linear energy - momentum relation , i.e. , for a two - dimensional dirac semimetal like graphene , with the hamiltonian , @xmath27 . in this case , the commutator reads , @xmath18= \\eta e^{2}\\mathcal{a}^{2}v_{f}^{2}\\sigma_{z}$ ] .",
    "this leads to an additional term in the hamiltonian , which is quadratic in @xmath2 and serves as a mass proportional to @xmath7 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ 2d_dirac_semimetal ] , the consequence of this term is that the spectrum can be gapped on application of circularly polarized light .",
    "this is a floquet counterpart of the chern insulator , which harbors protected chiral edge modes along with a bulk energy gap and has been extensively explored recently .",
    "@xcite          after studying the effects of light illumination on the semi - dirac semimetal , let us next look at its effects on a three - dimensional dirac semimetal .",
    "a low - energy hamiltonian for three - dimensional dirac semimetals around the brillouin zone center , considering terms up to quadratic in @xmath28 , is of the form  @xcite    @xmath29    where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the @xmath33 identity matrix .",
    "the energy eigenvalues are obtained as @xmath34 .",
    "the spectrum shows dirac crossings at @xmath35 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in addition to the bulk dirac points , the model also exhibits an inverted band order around the brillouin zone center .",
    "this means that when confined to a two - dimensional setup , the energy spectrum shows topological surface states , in the same way as three - dimensional topological insulators exhibit two - dimensional surface states in a slab geometry .    under the illumination by off - resonant circularly polarized light ,",
    "we start by invoking the form of approximate hamiltonian in equation  ( [ ham_floquet ] ) , and after some algebra , we find that in this case the commutator takes the form , @xmath18= -2\\eta e^{2}\\mathcal{a}^{2}am_{2}(k_{x}\\sigma_{x } - k_{y}\\sigma_{y } ) - \\eta e^{2}\\mathcal{a}^{2}a^{2}\\sigma_{z}$ ] .",
    "then , the effective hamiltonian for a three - dimensional dirac semimetal illuminated by circularly polarized light reads    @xmath36    note that in this case light induces terms proportional to all the three pauli matrices , in contrast to the case of two - dimensional dirac semimetals and semi - dirac semimetals .",
    "this includes a term proportional to @xmath7 which can modulate the mass , and thereby the band inversion strength .",
    "the total mass term is given by @xmath37 .",
    "the dependence of this term on the polarization , @xmath38 , means that changing the polarization from right to left ( i.e. , changing @xmath38 from + 1 to -1 ) would reverse the effect of light on the band inversion strength .",
    "additionally , there are terms proportional to @xmath39 linear in momentum , @xmath40 , which serve to renormalize the velocities in the @xmath41 directions .",
    "note , that the motion of the dirac points and the band inversion strength is governed by the term proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "the overall effect is a possibility to create a band inversion as well as crystal symmetry protected dirac points . to see this ,",
    "let us start with a topologically trivial insulator ( this is obtained by choosing @xmath42 and @xmath25 in the low energy model ) and switch - on the illumination .",
    "the resulting series of band structures are shown in fig .",
    "[ 3d_dirac_semimetal ] . as the light intensity",
    "is enhanced the band gap decreases , reaching a critical zero gap point . beyond this intensity",
    "the gap at the brillouin zone center reopens , with an inverted band order , and at the same time dirac points appear away from the center .",
    "interestingly , at the critical zero gap point the band structure is described by a three - dimensional version of the semi - dirac hamiltonian ,  @xcite i.e. , the bands disperse quadratically along @xmath43 , while dispersing linearly along @xmath44 as well as @xmath20 , as can be seen from the contour plot of the band gap in fig .",
    "[ 3d_dirac_semimetal ] .",
    "our argument can also be turned around to observe merging of dirac points , by switching the polarization of the illuminating light from right to left circularly polarized light . in this case one starts with a dirac semimetal and with increasing intensity of the applied light , the two time - reversed cones start moving towards the center of the brillouin zone .",
    "subsequently , they meet at a critical point where the band inversion is zero .",
    "further increase in light intensity would open a gap and render the material a trivial insulator .",
    "thus , depending on the polarization of light it is possible to increase as well as reduce the band inversion strength in three - dimensional dirac semimetals .    two materials na@xmath45bi and",
    "cd@xmath45as@xmath0 have been recently found to exhibit three - dimensional dirac fermion states , along with an inverted bulk gap . based on our proof - of - principle results",
    ", it would be interesting to expose these materials to intense circularly polarized beams to explore the suggested possibility of tuning the band inversion strength , as well as the @xmath28-space position of the dirac crossings .",
    "the photoillumination method that we propose here could also be applied to lower spin - orbit cousins of these known three - dimensional dirac semimetals na@xmath45bi and cd@xmath45as@xmath0 , namely na@xmath45sb and cd@xmath45p@xmath0 .",
    "this potentially mitigates the need for alloying with large spin - orbit elements to drive topological phase transitions .",
    "@xcite to get an estimate for the laser intensities needed to observe the topological phase transition , consider cd@xmath46p@xmath47 which has a trivial mass gap @xmath48  mev at @xmath49 and group velocity of bands near fermi level , @xmath50  m / s . experimentally used frequencies for experiments of interest are in the thousands of terahertz regime ,  @xcite and we set @xmath51  thz .",
    "this yields the required laser intensity as , @xmath52  w / m@xmath53 .",
    "given the recent advances in capability to manipulate the band structures of diverse set of materials using intense circularly polarized light ,  @xcite we are confident that our proposal can be an exciting playground to witness generation , as well as annihilation of three - dimensional dirac points .",
    "we note that a proposal similar to ours has been made recently to observe merging of two - dimensional dirac points in graphene .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated floquet dynamics in two - dimensional semi - dirac semimetals and three - dimensional dirac semimetals under off - resonant light . for semi - dirac semimetals we found that illumination with circularly polarized light",
    "does not lead to band gap opening , at variance with purely linearly dispersing bands . for three - dimensional dirac semimetals",
    ", we have shown that shining circularly polarized light leads to a modulation of the band inversion strength whose effect is opposite for right and left circularly polarized beams .",
    "additionally , the position of the three - dimensional dirac points in the reciprocal space can also be tuned .",
    "our results suggest that photoillumination of three - dimensional dirac semimetals can be an exciting platform to investigate generation , motion and annihilation of dirac points .",
