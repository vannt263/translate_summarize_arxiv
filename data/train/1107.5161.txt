    "- de sitter models correspond to conformal quantum field theories on the boundary . in this approach",
    "quantum theories on the minkowski spacetime come from ( and actually are believed to be equivalent to ) models in higher dimensional anti - de sitter universes .",
    "on the other hand , the anti - de sitter manifold may be also viewed as an infrared ( covariant ) regularization of the minkowski spacetime @xcite ; poincar invariant models can be constructed by taking the flat limit of anti - de sitter ones . in this way",
    "one can gain information on minkowskian quantum field theories from anti - de sitter models having the same spacetime dimensionality .    in both cases ,",
    "the correspondences between anti - de sitter and minkowski theories may be used to uncover new pieces of mathematics .",
    "the idea is that to a known relation existing on the minkowski spacetime there should correspond a possibly unknown relation on the anti - de sitter universe and vicecersa .    in this paper",
    "we use this idea to guess and prove a new class of linearization identities among hypergeometric functions .",
    "this was suggested by a series of related papers @xcite where we have considered particle decays in the de sitter universe .",
    "the effort necessary to compute the klln - lehmann weights needed to evaluate the lifetime of de sitter particles unveiled there a rich mathematical structure ; new integral formulae for products of three legendre functions followed .    trying to solve the same problem in the anti - de sitter case",
    "provides a new class of nontrivial identities between hypergeometric functions .",
    "the mathematics behind these new identities is however quite different .    in the end of the paper , as an application of our results , we briefly discuss the problem of particle decay in the anti - de sitter universe and its flat limit .",
    "this example will make clear the value of the anti - de sitter universe as an infrared regulator of calculations which are divergent in the flat case .",
    "in particular we compute the total probability of decay of a given anti - de sitter one - particle state into all possible two - particle states at first order in perturbation theory .",
    "this quantity is divergent both in the minkowski and the de sitter universes while it is perfectly finite and can be explicitly computed in the anti - de sitter case .",
    "this quantity , once it is divided by the radius of the anti - de sitter universe , has a flat limit proportional to the inverse lifetime of a corresponding minkowski unstable particle as it is usually computed by means of the fermi golden rule .",
    "however we have not yet fully solved the problem of finding a unique anti - de sitter normalization to get the right dependence of such lifetime on the speed of the minkowski particle .",
    "the point is that the lifetime is obtained in the minkowski case as the ratio of two divergent quantities while the anti - de sitter amplitude is already finite and it is not completely clear what the `` amplitude per unit time '' should be in the anti - de sitter spacetime .",
