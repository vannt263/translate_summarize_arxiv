    "few gravitational lens systems are as well studied as jvas b0218 + 357 @xcite , perhaps the best example of a lens system for which the method of @xcite can be used to determine the hubble parameter , @xmath3 . unlike many other methods ,",
    "this is done in a single step and involves well understood , and relatively simple , astrophysics .",
    "we point out that there remain significant uncertainties in @xmath3 as determined by traditional methods ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the use of cepheid - calibrated distances to determine the distance to galaxies hosting type ia supernovae has resulted in final values of @xmath3 that do not agree at the @xmath5 ( @xmath210  per  cent ) level @xcite .",
    "this is despite a large overlap between the samples of snia .    whilst the gravitational lens route to @xmath3 can be a particularly `` clean '' one , and despite many lens systems now having measured time delays , almost all suffer in one way or another from effects that significantly increase the uncertainty in the final determination of @xmath3 . in most cases",
    "the main source of uncertainty is in the modelling of the gravitational potential responsible for the image splitting and distortion .",
    "a lack of observational data to constrain the lens model and multiple - galaxy lenses are both significant factors in this regard ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a list of the time delays measured to date can be found in @xcite .    with jvas b0218",
    "+ 357 on the other hand , the potential exists to reduce the uncertainty in the lens model to a level comparable to that in the time delay ; this currently stands at 3  per  cent ( @xmath6  d ; biggs et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "other authors find a value for the time delay consistent with this @xcite .",
    "this reduction in model uncertainty is possible due to the large number of observational model constraints available from multi - frequency , multi - resolution imaging",
    ". both images ( a and b ) of the @xmath7 background quasar / bl  lac are easily resolved with vlbi into two subcomponents ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which constrain the radial mass profile to be close to isothermal .",
    "the lens systems with the largest numbers of model constraints are those that contain einstein rings , such as b0218 + 357 .",
    "the resolved arcsec - scale structure of the ring probes the lens potential along multiple lines of sight and along all azimuthal position angles relative to the lens centre .",
    "the ring ( see fig .  [ vlamap ] ) has been mapped at high resolution using combined merlin and vla data at 5  ghz @xcite and the model constrained using a version of the lensclean algorithm @xcite ; preliminary results can be found in @xcite .",
    "finally , the deflecting mass is concentrated in a single , isolated galaxy and so the effect of tidal shear due to nearby structure is very small ( @xmath21  per  cent , lehr et al .",
    "this results in a relatively uncomplicated mass model compared to other lens systems .",
    "a vla map of b0218 + 357 can be seen in fig .",
    "[ vlamap ] .",
    "the main stumbling block to date in measuring @xmath3 with jvas b0218 + 357 has been that , due predominantly to the small size of the system ( a - b separation of 334  mas ) , it has been difficult to measure the position of the @xmath8 lensing galaxy relative to the lensed images accurately using optical ( @xmath9 ) data . for example , the positions derived from two nicmos observations differ by 46  mas @xcite and this uncertainty translates into a large uncertainty in @xmath3 . with lensclean",
    "we have estimated the galaxy position to a theoretical accuracy of a few mas , but this relies to some extent on the lens model and so could be biased .        in this paper",
    "we present new 8.4-ghz observations of jvas b0218 + 357 taken with a global vlbi array that were designed to increase the available model constraints by other means . with the great sensitivity of a global array we hoped we might detect :    1 .",
    "extended structure associated with the radio jet in both a and b. this is detected in 5-ghz data from the first caltech - jodrell bank ( cj1 ) vlbi survey @xcite that we have re - analysed to produce maps ( fig .",
    "[ cj ] ) that are superior to those published in @xcite . with a resolution of @xmath25",
    "mas these new maps reveal a jet that extends out to 30  mas from the core in each image .",
    "2 .   a third image , as detected in , e.g. apm  08279 + 5255 @xcite and mg  1131 + 0456 @xcite , and 3 .   the galaxy core .",
    "emission from the lensing galaxy has been detected in several systems e.g. b0957 + 561 @xcite and class b2045 + 265 @xcite .",
    "a third radio component is detected in pmn  j1632 - 0033 , but it is not known if this is a lensed image or the lens galaxy @xcite .",
    "the observations have also been used to investigate the mas - scale polarisation structure of this system .",
    "whilst the cores of most quasars / bl  lacs are polarised at a level of about 23  per  cent @xcite , images a and b of b0218 + 357 are both much more highly polarised , reaching @xmath210  per  cent at frequencies 8.4  ghz and above @xcite . also , the polarisation position angles of the images are not the same , in conflict with the expected behaviour of a lens system which preserves the polarisation position angle on the sky @xcite .",
    "it is thought that faraday rotation in the magnetoionic medium of the lensing galaxy itself rotates the position angles of the images by different amounts @xcite .",
    "thus the extended nature of the emission in images a and b allows the interstellar medium ( ism ) of a high - redshift galaxy to be studied on parsec scales .",
    "both images also depolarise at low frequencies .",
    "the goals of this experiment required a combination of high sensitivity , high resolution and excellent @xmath10 coverage in order to reliably image complex and faint structures . for this reason we used a global vlbi array including the ten antennas of the vlba , six from the european vlbi network ( evn ) , the vla ( y ) in phased - array mode and the two 70-m antennas of the deep space network ( dsn ) at goldstone and robledo .",
    "details of these antennas are given in table  [ antennas ] with their diameters and system equivalent flux densities ( sefd ) .",
    "we chose to observe at 8.4  ghz instead of at 5  ghz ( where the surface brightness sensitivity is better ) due to the improved resolution and because there is less chance that the lensed emission would be affected by scattering ; there is evidence that the image sizes in this system may be enlarged by scattering at low frequencies ( biggs et al .",
    ", in preparation , although see @xcite for a 1.7-ghz map that illustrates the large size increase ) . scattering would possibly reduce the surface brightness of the third image or the galaxy core which is clearly undesirable when searching for such weak features .",
    ".global vlbi array antennas and performance at 8.4  ghz .",
    "observations were conducted in dual circular polarisation at all antennas apart from nt , on and yb where only right circular polarisation was available . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ jmfit ]    we assume that the observed size of an a sub - component is the sum , in quadrature , of the intrinsic size and a scattering scale size ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we further assume that , for each sub - component , the true intrinsic size is actually that of its image b counterpart i.e. that this image is unaffected by scattering at this frequency .",
    "this assumption is supported by the similarity of the deconvolved size of b1 as measured from these data and the 15-ghz data of @xcite .",
    "the derived size of @xmath11 is also shown in table  [ jmfit ] and is the same for both sub - components , 0.8  mas .",
    "the true size of the scattering disc ( we have measured sub - component sizes in the source plane ) is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the angular diameter distance between the earth and the lensed source and @xmath14 that between the lensing galaxy and the lensed source .",
    "the relation in equation  ( [ thesecondequation ] ) is analogous to that between the true deflection angle ( @xmath15 ) and the _ apparent _ deflection angle ( @xmath16 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "no correction for the lens magnification is required as the displacement in the image plane due to scattering is the scattering angle magnified by the lens , and this was removed when back - projecting each image .",
    "we calculate @xmath17  mas .",
    "the size of the scattering disk is equal to the refractive length scale ( @xmath18 ) subtended at the distance of the lensing galaxy @xcite . using the formulation of @xcite we have estimated the scattering strength ( sm ) of the ionised medium . with the observed frequency of 8.4  ghz corrected to the redshift of the lensing galaxy we measure @xmath19",
    "this is a very large value compared to those seen along typical lines of sight through the galaxy , although comparable ( and in some cases much higher ) values have been measured , particularly towards the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "therefore , although the scattering in front of b0218 + 357 image a is extreme , it is not ruled out by observations in the galaxy .",
    "the polarisation properties of this system continue to intrigue . from observations of this system with merlin and the vla ,",
    "a general picture has emerged of image a being less polarised than image b and of both depolarising with increasing wavelength , albeit much more steeply in a. the reason for this is probably inhomogeneities in the magneto - ionic medium that is responsible for the faraday rotation of the polarisation position angles , inhomogeneities that are greater in the region of a than b. complications that hinder the interpretation of the polarisation results include `` beating '' of the polarisation position angles of sub - components 1 and 2 ( for observations which do not resolve the sub - components ) , changing source structure with frequency and different magnification gradients across each image .",
    "the resolution afforded by vlbi observations allows the polarisation structure of the source to be resolved and constraints to be put on the angular scale of the inhomogeneities in the faraday screen . in fig .",
    "[ global2 ] we see that image b , the least resolved of the images , is seen to have a higher peak polarisation ( 20  per  cent ) than that of a ( 12  per  cent ) .",
    "this shows that we are not seeing the effects of _ intrinsic _ changes in the polarisation structures across the radio source as the lower effective resolution of b would cause these to be averaged incoherently more than in a i.e. we would expect image b to be less polarised than image a. therefore ,",
    "our global vlbi maps support the theory that the depolarisation is due to non - uniformities in the faraday screen which are greater in front of image a. they also allow us to constrain the size of these irregularities which must be smaller than the synthesised beam i.e. @xmath201  mas .",
    "this corresponds to a linear distance of @xmath207  pc at the redshift of the lensing galaxy .",
    "we also note that the scatter - broadening identified in section  [ scattering ] could cause the depolarisation .",
    "this is because scatter - broadening effectively blurs a source , causing regions with different polarisations to overlap and be averaged together .",
    "as the scattering is different in front of each image the polarisations of each will be different and , as scattering increases at longer wavelengths , the observed frequency dependence of the depolarisation could also result .",
    "another interpretation is that the differences between the images could result from the combination of intrinsic polarisation variability and time delay .",
    "vla monitoring @xcite has shown that this source is variable in polarisation as well as in total flux density .",
    "two - epoch vlbi observations separated by the time delay , @xmath21  d , could help to clarify the polarisation structure in this source . at the same time",
    "the picture of a being more depolarised than b is too simplistic . from earlier vla monitoring observations @xcite",
    "it was found that , with the time delay removed , the polarisation of image b was _ lower _ than that of image a at 15  ghz , the opposite to what is usually observed",
    ". this could signify time variability within the magneto - ionic medium or movement of the source relative to this .",
    "we have presented new maps of the lens system jvas  b0218 + 357 made with a global vlbi array that combine excellent sensitivity and resolution to produce the best maps yet of the mas - scale structure of this system .",
    "unfortunately , we were unsuccessful in detecting the third image or the core of the lensing galaxy . with the new maps we have been able to explore several aspects of the lensing galaxy . from the different lengths of the jet in each image we have been able to constrain the radial mass profile and find that it is slightly steeper than isothermal ( @xmath4 )",
    "we also find evidence for multi - path scattering and depolarisation due to the disparity between the component sizes and polarisations in each image .",
    "these physical effects most likely result from propagation through the turbulent ionised ism of the lensing galaxy and , in this way , b0218 + 357 is probably the best example of how gravitational lensing can act as a unique probe of the ism of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "these data will be used with lensclean @xcite in order to exploit fully the resolved structure of the images and provide further constraints for the lens model . whilst the effects of scatter - broadening might seem to limit the usefulness of these data for lens modelling",
    ", we note that the effects of the scattering and the lens can be separated .",
    "this is because scattering only effects the sizes of components whilst the lens changes both the component sizes and separations .",
    "therefore , future modelling will be able to not only constrain the lens model , but also to characterise the scattering more accurately than has been possible in this paper .",
    "further observations with a global vlbi array at 5  ghz may be worthwhile to try and detect , with higher dynamic range , the jet emission that has been revealed in the new cj maps ( fig .  [ cj ] ) .",
    "the present and future vlbi maps will be used to constrain the lens model , in conjunction with merlin , vla and @xmath9 data .",
    "@xmath9 observations will be carried out with the advanced camera for surveys which our simulations predict will give us an accuracy of @xmath210  mas in the galaxy position relative to the lensed images . with",
    "this vital parameter in the lens model finally measured directly ( as opposed to the _ modelled _ position found from lensclean ) the uncertainty in the @xmath3 determination from this system will be reduced to a level of about 3  per  cent .",
    "the vlba and vla are operated by the national radio astronomy observatory which is a facility of the national science foundation operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc .",
