    "electrical measurements have recently been used to measure the pressure - induced surface deformation of conductive membranes . in particular , electrical impedance tomography ( eit )",
    "has been used to develop flexible pressure sensors @xcite , because it allows the electromechanical behavior of an electrically conducting film to be monitored . when a pressure - sensitive conductive sheet is exposed to pressure ,",
    "the deformation of the surface alters the conductivity distribution , which can be detected by an eit system",
    ". however , rigorous studies employing mathematical modeling and reconstruction methods have not yet been conducted .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic mathematical framework for an eit - based flexible pressure sensor .",
    "our rigorous mathematical analysis is based on the consideration of a simple model of an eit - based pressure - sensor using a thin , flexible conductive membrane whose electrical conductance is directly related to pressure - induced deformation .",
    "we assume that the conductive membrane is stretched over a fixed frame and has a number of electrodes placed on its boundary as shown in figure [ membrane ] . as in a standard eit system",
    ", we use all adjacent pairs of electrodes to inject currents and measure induced boundary voltages between all neighboring pairs of electrodes to get a current - voltage data set , which is a discrete version of a neumann - to - dirichlet map .",
    "the current - voltage data can probe any external pressure loaded onto the membrane , because the pressure - induced surface deformation results in a change of the current density distribution over the surface , which leads to a change of the current - voltage data .",
    "hence , the change in the current - voltage data can be viewed as a non - linear function of pressure .",
    "the inverse problem in this model is to identify the pressure ( equivalently the surface deformation ) from the boundary current - voltage data .    conductive membrane attached electrodes on the boundary in the absence of pressure(left ) and presence of pressure(right ) . ]",
    "this paper provides a derivation of an eit - based pressure - sensing model , which describes the explicit relationship between the measured current - voltage data and the pressure .",
    "the mathematical model is associated with an elliptic partial differential equation ( pde ) with an anisotropic coefficient , which comes from the pressure - induced surface deformation . to be precise ,",
    "let @xmath0 be a two - dimensional domain with a smooth boundary @xmath1 occupying the un - deformed membrane in the absence of any pressure .",
    "we denote the standard sobolev space of order @xmath2 as @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be the pressure and @xmath5 be the solution of @xmath6    under pressure @xmath4 , the current - voltage data @xmath7 are dictated by @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the solution of the elliptic pde , @xmath10 where @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the identity matrix , the superscript @xmath13 denotes the transpose , @xmath14 the unit outward normal vector to @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",

    "we can not invert the map @xmath19 with the existing eit reconstruction methods because of the well - known non - uniqueness result of the inverse problem : there are infinitely many anisotropic coefficients @xmath20 such that @xmath21 . hence",
    ", we must consider the constrained inverse problem of recovering anisotropic coefficient within the set of coefficient tensors associated with pressures .",
    "taking account of the fact that two different pressures @xmath4 and @xmath22 produce the same neumann - to - dirichlet map , we need to impose a proper constraint on pressures .",
    "next , we propose a pressure reconstruction method with the standard @xmath23-channel eit system .",
    "owing to the quadratic structure of @xmath24 in @xmath25 , we can not expect a linearized reconstruction method for @xmath4 , even assuming that pressure is small .",
    "regarding @xmath4 as a piecewise constant function @xmath26 , through the standard discretization of the domain into small elements , @xmath27 , the inverse problem can be approximated by solving a large linear system with a large number of unknowns involving all possible products @xmath28 .",
    "( here , @xmath29 is the indicator function of @xmath27 . ) given that most of the columns of the matrix have relatively small effect on the data , we consider a reduced linear system by eliminating most of the columns .",
    "various numerical simulations verify the feasibility of the reconstruction algorithm .    in section  [ sec : framework ]",

    ", we develop a reconstruction algorithm based on sensitivity analysis , and validate the algorithm by numerical simulation results .",
    "this mathematical study of an eit - based flexible pressure sensor is in an early stage .",
    "the proposed mathematical model requires the assumption of incompressibility , whereas there are many flexible materials that are not incompressible .",
    "constructing a mathematical model that includes compressibility will be a future research topic .",
    "assume that a thin conductive membrane at rest occupies a two - dimensional bounded domain @xmath30 with a smooth boundary @xmath15 . here",

    "when the pressure @xmath4 is loaded on @xmath0 , it produces a displacement of the membrane .",
    "the displacement at @xmath36 from its rest position is denoted by @xmath37 , and the deformed two - dimensional surface can be expressed as @xmath38 here , the boundary @xmath15 of the membrane is fixed so that there is no displacement on the boundary . because the membrane undergoes deformation to reduce the area change caused by pressure @xmath39 , @xmath5 satisfies the prescribed mean curvature equation , @xmath40 problem has a unique solution for @xmath39 with @xmath34 being sufficiently small such that , for any measurable subset @xmath41 of @xmath0 , @xmath42 is smaller than the perimeter of @xmath41 @xcite .",

    "if the deformed membrane is uniform in thickness , the resulting potential @xmath58 satisfies the surface laplace equation , @xmath66 , along the surface with @xmath67 being the laplace - beltrami operator .",

    "define @xmath71 by @xmath72 the pair @xmath73 is called current - to - voltage pair . here , @xmath74 .",
    "apparently , the voltage difference , @xmath75 , reflects the information of the displacement .",
    "therefore , it is possible to recover @xmath4 from several pairs @xmath76 .",
    "the inverse problem is to reconstruct @xmath4 and @xmath5 from the boundary voltage - to - current data @xmath76 .",
    "there are serious difficulties in solving the inverse problem , because the potential @xmath58 in ( [ neumannbvp-2 ] ) is defined on the unknown surface @xmath52 in three dimensions , and the measured data , @xmath77 , are given on the boundary of the two - dimensional domain @xmath0 .",
    "the relation between the surface , @xmath52 , and the data , @xmath77 , is too complicated to handle the inverse problem . to deal with these difficulties ,",
    "we introduce the following function defined in the known two - dimensional domain , @xmath0 , as @xmath78 the following theorem provides a governing equation for @xmath9 , through which the relationship between current and voltage can be understood .    the function @xmath9 in ( [ proj ] ) is dictated by the following elliptic equation @xmath79 where @xmath25 is a symmetric positive definite matrix given by @xmath80    let @xmath81 denote the extension of @xmath58 such that @xmath82 for all @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",

    "hence , by the unique continuation property , it follows that @xmath139    it remains to prove that @xmath140 .",

    "this concludes that if @xmath158 , then @xmath169 in @xmath0 , which completes the proof .",

    "<S> this paper presents a mathematical framework for a flexible pressure - sensor model using electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) . when pressure is applied to a conductive membrane patch with clamped boundary , the pressure - induced surface deformation results in a change in the conductivity distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this change can be detected in the current - voltage data ( _ i.e. , _ eit data ) measured on the boundary of the membrane patch . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the corresponding inverse problem is to reconstruct the pressure distribution from the data . </S>",
    "<S> the 2d apparent conductivity ( in terms of eit data ) corresponding to the surface deformation is anisotropic . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we consider a constrained inverse problem by restricting the coefficient tensor to the range of the map from pressure to 2d - apparent conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> this paper provides theoretical grounds for the mathematical model of the inverse problem . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a reconstruction algorithm based on a careful sensitivity analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the performance of the reconstruction algorithm through numerical simulations to validate its feasibility for future experimental studies .    electrical impedance tomography , pressure sensing , conductive membrane , inverse problem , prescribed mean curvature equation .    35r30 , 35j25 , 53a10 </S>"
