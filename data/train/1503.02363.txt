    "non local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) exists in a wide variety of astrophysical and laboratory plasmas .",
    "examples of nlte astronomical plasmas are the stellar corona , interstellar nebulae and some other low density ionized plasmas .",
    "x - ray satellites , such as chandra and xmm - newton , provided large amount of high resolution spectra from astronomical objects , many of which are in nlte . in laboratory , nlte exists in laser produced plasmas , tokamaks and z - pinch based experiments .    in the present paper",
    ", we introduce a new nlte plasma computer code , which we called radiative - collisional code based on fac ( abbreviated rcf ) .",
    "rcf is a radiative - collisional code that includes photoionization as well , thereby it is appropriate especially to astrophysical plasmas . in the following",
    "we show its accuracy relative to other codes .",
    "several similar codes , which are being used for analysis of astrophysical spectra , have already been published in the literature .",
    "examples are galaxy ( @xcite , @xcite , 2006jqsrt .. 99 .. 712f , @xcite ) , nimp ( 1992jphb ... 25.2745d , @xcite ) , flychk ( 2003jqsrt .. 81 .. 107c ) , cloudy ( @xcite ) , xstar ( 1996apj ... 465 .. 994k , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , phicre ( 2011apj ... 742 ... 52s , @xcite ) and sasal ( 2014apj ... 783 .. 124l ) . some of these codes are used to interpret laboratory experiments ( galaxy , flychk , nimp and phicre ) , while others are used in analysis of astrophysical spectra ( cloudy and xstar ) , while rcf is designed to be applicable to both of the conditions above .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a detail introduction of rcf and to present its application to a phoionization experiment .",
    "section 2 presents the model and the method of to calculate the atomic rate coefficients . in section 3",
    ", we apply rcf to reproduce the iron charge state distribution of a photonionization experiment , together with a discussion of the importance of the various atomic processes .",
    "a short summary is given in the last section .",
    "rcf is a steady - state collisional - radiative optically - thin model .",
    "its rate - equation ( @xcite ) is @xmath0where @xmath1 is the density of the @xmath2th level of the @xmath3th charge state .",
    "the processes included are the ionization and recombination between neighboring charge states and excitation and de - excitation within the same charge state .",
    "their inverse processes are also taken into account by detailed balance principle .",
    "the processes included in eq.(1 ) are listed in table [ tab : ap ] .",
    ".atomic processes in rcf ( @xcite ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      to fe@xmath4.,title=\"fig : \" ] +     @xmath5 to @xmath6 @xmath7 of fe@xmath8 .",

    "( b)transition from @xmath9 @xmath10 to @xmath11 @xmath12 of fe@xmath13 .",
    "grey solid : ( ) , black square : present fac , circle : dirac r - matrix ( @xcite).,title=\"fig : \" ] +     +    in figure [ f2 ] , we compare the influences of some important processes on the experimental results . case a is the one presented in figure [ f1 ] , in which we included all the relevant processes in rcf and all the configurations in table [ tab : con ] .",
    "case b uses data without the doubly excited levels in table [ tab : con ] .",
    "as can be seen , there are significant differences relative to case a.    in case c both the autoionization and its inverse process , dielectronic capture , are turned off .",
    "results of case c are close to those of case b , and both predict an average charge lower than that of case a. this means that doubly excited states are non - ignorable in the current calculation of charge state distributions .",
    "in other words , autoionization is an important ionizing channel , and doubly excited states act like ladders to the next charge state in this experiment .",
    "+    in cases d and e , we examine the influence of the radiation field on the sandia experiment charge state distribution .",
    "first we note that there is a big difference between the binding energy of the two most important charge states in the experiment : the ionization energy of fe@xmath8 ( na - like ) is 489.312 ev , and that of fe@xmath13(ne - like ) is 1262.7 ev .",
    "as shown in figure [ f3 ] , a larger fraction of photons than electrons has sufficient energy to excite or ionize fe@xmath14 and fe@xmath15 .",
    "in fact , we have found that the influence of electron collisional ionization is so small that its omission from the computations is hardly different from case a.    there are two radiation driven processes in the code , photoexcitation ( pe ) and photoionization ( pi ) .",
    "pe is omitted in case d , whereas pi is turned off in case e. it can be seen from figure [ f2 ] that the absence of pe significantly reduces the average charge state , _",
    "i.e. _ , photoexcited states play an important role in the charge state distribution .",
    "case e is very close to case a. the reason for this behavior is the large difference between the binding energies of fe@xmath14 and fe@xmath15 . on the other hand",
    ", there is a threshold between fe@xmath13 and fe@xmath4 , because neon - like fe@xmath15 has a closed shell stable configuration .",
    "both of pe and pi have preference to ionize inner - shell electrons resulting in autoionizing states .",
    "however , according to the photon energy distribution in figure [ f3 ] and the energy levels of main ions , the doubly excited levels seem to be more likely produced by pe process .",
    "actually , when the pe channel to doubly excited states is shut down , the result is almost the same as case d , which confirms that pe is the main pumping mechanism of doubly excited states .",
    "case e indicates that pe+ai process wins the competition in ionizing fe@xmath8 , but for fe@xmath13 the pi channel is important , too .    in case",
    "f , collisional excitation ( ce ) is omitted , and it gets a strange result .",
    "the deletion of ce does not lower @xmath16 as case d , but rather the plasma is more ionized than case a. according to figure [ f3 ] , although the electrons have comparatively lower energy and can not ionize the ions as effectively as photons , they still can excite the ions to singly excited levels by collision .",
    "however , the collision produced singly excited levels have smaller reaction cross sections with photons than the ground state and lower levels , namely , they are more difficult to be ionized by photons",
    ". therefore , the electrons certainly would take part in the competition of reacting with the ground state of ions , and as a result reducing the ionizing efficiency of pi and pe+ai .",
    "what is more , when the ce channel from the ground states of ions to the singly excited states is shut down , it produces a result similar to case f , which confirms the discussion above . so that , it makes sense that why @xmath16 rises when ce is shut down .    in conclusion",
    ", rcf has a good agreement to the photoionization experiment results ( @xcite ) , and gives reasonable explanation for the charge state distribution . in the calculations of rcf ,",
    "the charge state distribution of this experiment is a composite result of different atomic processes .",
    "the external field dominates the ionizations in the plasma by photoionization directly and photoexcitation plus autoionization indirectly .",
    "the transitions within any given single charge state can significantly affect the charge state distribution , and one of the interesting results of our computations is the role played by collisional excitation in this experiment , in which it reduces the total ionization rate by competing with pe and pi .",
    "in this paper we introduced a new code , rcf , which is applied to plasma in nlte condition , especially in the photoionization dominating regime .",
    "this code can calculate the level population , charge state distribution and spectra of a plasma in steady state .",
    "the atomic data source of this code is fac , which is an easy to use and powerful software package to calculate various atomic data .",
    "the sfac interface can provide all the atomic data needed in rcf , without any additional modifications .",
    "fac is based on a fully relativistic theoretical framework , which ensures the accuracy and consistency of the atomic data .",
    "all the plasma processes and their inverse ones are related by the detailed balance principle in rcf . as a result ,",
    "in high density regime , the rcf generates results similar to the saha equation with same atomic data . in other words",
    ", rcf converges to lte approximation under the appropriate condition . in radiation",
    "dominant regimes , rcf gets a charge state distribution which closely agrees to the results of the fe photoionization experiment .",
    "a comparison is given to the results of other similar codes .",
    "we also discussed the influence of the various atomic processes to the charge state distribution of this experiment .",
    "photoionization is not the only important ionizing channel , but the photoexcitation plus autoionization process are proved to be also significant .",
    "although the electrons have comparatively lower energy than the photons , they still are important .",
    "the electrons can excite the ions to the levels which have small reaction cross sections for the photons , and the result is reducing the ionizing efficiency of the photons .",
    "the charge state and levels distributions are a prerequisite for the simulation of the emission spectrum , and we showed that all the atomic processes may have significant effect under the appropriate conditions . in particular , in the analysis of x - ray spectrum from a compact object photoexcitation is an important pumping mechanism ( @xcite ) .",
    "porquet & dubau ( 2004 ) also emphasized the influence of cascading decay from higher levels and collisional excitation on the line ratios in plasma diagnosis . according to the result shown",
    ", rcf is a reasonable code to get accurate distributions in steady nlte plasma by including all the processes and using fac data .",
    "we shall use it for spectrum analysis in astrophysics and laboratory of photoionizing and collisional nlte plasmas in our further works .",
