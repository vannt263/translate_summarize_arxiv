    "the formation mechanism of massive stars remains much debated with core accretion , competitive accretion and even protostellar collisions still discussed ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "one of the key differences between high and low - mass protostars is that the former are expected to complete the later stages of their accretion while fusing hydrogen on the main sequence .",
    "their photospheres should be hot and strong sources of lyman continnum photons with energies @xmath11  ev , which can photoionize h to create an region .",
    "these protostellar regions are important for at least two main reasons .",
    "first , by their long wavelength radio free - free and hydrogen recombination line ( hrl ) emission they provide diagnostics of the massive star formation process .",
    "second , the ionized gas reaches temperatures of @xmath12  k and its thermal pressure could be an important feedback process that regulates massive star formation , either by disrupting the wider scale accretion reservoir (",
    "i.e. , core envelope or bondi - hoyle competitive accretion region : e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or by photoevaporation of the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "our goal in this study is to present model calculations of the structure of the earliest - stage protostellar regions in the context of the turbulent core model of @xcite ( hereafter , mt03 )",
    ". early work in this direction was carried out by @xcite , who described these structures as `` outflow - confined '' regions , since the magneto - centrifugally - launched protostellar outflow ( either disk - wind , x - wind or both ) will be the first barrier to the ionizing photons .",
    "@xcite studied the structure and evolution of  regions that are confined by the infalling flow onto the protostellar disk .",
    "however , their model did not include the effect of the mhd - driven outflow .",
    "if massive stars form in a scaled - up , but similar manner to low - mass stars , then we expect such outflows to always be present around massive protostars during their main accretion phase .",
    "indeed , larger - scale collimated outflows are often observed to be driven from massive protostars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* )    a series of massive protostellar evolution calculations to predict continuum radiative transfer , especially infrared to sub - mm morphologies and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , has been carried out by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( hereafter , zth14 ) . here",
    "we will calculate the ionization structure and associated radio emission predicted by these protostellar evolutionary sequences .",

    "the eventual goal of our work will be to compare the developed models with such observations , however , detailed comparison with individual sources , requiring tailored protostellar models , is deferred to future works in this series .",

    "the zams properties are shown by the dotted lines.,width=340 ]    we calculate the photoionization structure and present synthetic observations in the context of the turbulent core accretion model of mt03 .",
    "we use a series of models of protostellar evolution and surrounding gas structure constructed by zth14 , which self - consistently include the evolution of the protostar and disk formed from a rotating parent core embedded in a particular clump environment , and mass accretion regulated by disk - wind outflows .",
    "we note that these models are highly idealized in that they assume axisymmetry about a single protostar , while real objects will be more irregular , especially if the initial core is highly turbulent , and may be forming in a cluster environment with other protostars in the vicinity .",
    "even if there is a relatively ordered and isolated core that is collapsing to a central disk , this collapse may lead to binary or low - order multiple star formation .",
    "still , by first presenting the simplest case of formation of an isolated massive protostar , we can then see how relevant such models are as approximations to real systems .    here",
    "we briefly review the evolution of the protostar and its surrounding gas structures .",
    "the initial core is assumed to be spherical and in near virial equilibrium via support by turbulence and/or magnetic fields .",
    "the evolutionary track of a core is determined by three environmental initial conditions : core mass @xmath33 , mass surface density of ambient clump @xmath34 ( which sets surface pressure of the core ) , and ratio of the core s initial rotational to gravitational energy @xmath35 .",
    "we fix the rotational parameter @xmath36 as a typical value from observations of lower - mass cores @xcite .",
    "the core density structure is described by a power law in spherical radius , @xmath37 .",
    "values of @xmath38@xmath39 are inferred from observations of dense cores in infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath40 as a fiducial value , following mt03 .",
    "then , the radius of a core is @xmath41 .",
    "since the core is in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding clump , it is more compact for higher @xmath34 .",
    "table [ tab_model ] presents the parameter sets of @xmath42 for which we study the ionization structures .",
    "these are the same as studied by zth14 .",
    "we refer to model group a as a fiducial group with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we also investigate high- and low-@xmath34 cases , model groups al and ah , and @xmath45 and 240@xmath46 cases , as model groups b and c , respectively .",
    "the core undergoes inside - out collapse @xcite with the effect of rotation described with the solution by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "given the high accretion rates associated with collapse of dense cores , the protostellar disk is expected to be massive and self - gravitating such that angular momentum may be transported by torques due to , e.g. , spiral arm structures .",
    "considering this efficient angular momentum transfer , the mass ratio between disk and protostar is set to be a constant @xmath47 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the disk structure is described by a standard @xmath48-viscosity disk model @xcite , but also including the effects of infall and outflow ( conservations of mass and angular momentum ) .",
    "the temperatures at the midplane are evaluated by vertical energy balance , and the vertical structure of the disk is determined by this temperature .",
    "the disk surface is set by assuming continuity with the density structure of the outflow .",
    "more details about the disk model are described in @xcite .",
    "the mass accretion rate onto the forming protostar @xmath49 is @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the instantaneous and averaged star formation efficiencies .",
    "the instantaneous star formation efficiency @xmath53 is the ratio of the accretion rate onto the star to the idealized spherical infall rate from the initial cloud core in the absence of feedback : a certain percentage of infalling material is swept up by the disk wind ( see next paragraph ) and a fraction , @xmath54 , of the accreted mass remains in the disk during the protostellar phase .",
    "the averaged star formation efficiency @xmath55 is the ratio of the stellar mass to the idealized collapsed mass of the initial cloud core at the same stage of infall in the absence of feedback .",
    "the accretion rate is high for high clump mass surface densities , since high @xmath34 results in a more compact core and thus shorter collapse time .",
    "also , this formula indicates that in the no - feedback limit of @xmath56 , the accretion rate increases with time , i.e. , as @xmath57 ( see mt03 ) .",
    "the magnetically driven bipolar outflows sweep up part of the core and thus help set the star formation efficiency @xmath58 .",
    "the density and velocity distributions of the outflow are described by a semi - analytic disk wind solution that is modified from the centrifugally driven outflow model of @xcite ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "the mass loading rate of the wind is proportional to the mass accretion rate , with a ratio @xmath59 assumed as a typical value @xcite .",
    "the velocity is as high as @xmath60 near the rotation axis and then smoothly decreases at lower latitudes .",
    "this outflow velocity structure represents features of both a collimated fast jet and a wider - angle , slower wind .",
    "the opening angle of the outflow cavity @xmath61 is estimated following the method of @xcite : if the outflow momentum is strong enough to accelerate the core material to its escape speed , the outflow extends in that direction .",
    "the outflow momentum , @xmath62 , is evaluated by integrating the momentum rate @xmath63 over time .",
    "the momentum injection rate is typically @xmath64  @xmath65 in our model , where @xmath66 is the keplerian speed at the stellar radius .",
    "this process sets the star formation efficiency @xmath58 ( and also @xmath55 ) . for more details of the outflow model and the evaluation of the star formation efficiency ,",
    "see @xcite and zth14 .",
    "figure [ fig_n ] shows an example of the evolution of the density and velocity structures in the fiducial case .",
    "the gradual opening - up of the outflow can be seen at the scale of @xmath67 with typical outflow velocity of @xmath68@xmath69 which is high near the axis .",
    "this leads to a decrease in the instantaneous star formation efficiency .",
    "at the end of accretion in this model , the stellar mass reaches @xmath70 and the final averaged star formation efficiency is @xmath71 . for the different models , the averaged final star formation efficiencies are similar , with a range of @xmath72@xmath73 .",
    "while we expect the momentum flux from protostellar outflows to be the dominant source of feedback , we note that additional feedback processes due to ionization , ( line - driven ) stellar winds and radiation pressure are not yet included in our modeling , so the above efficiencies may be somewhat overestimated .",
    "the growth of the disk radius can be seen in the panels showing the scale of @xmath74 .",
    "note , partly for the reason of being near the end of its accretion phase and having a relatively low accretion rate , the disk in the @xmath75 case appears relatively thin compared to earlier stages ( zth14 ) . on the @xmath74 scales",
    ", we also see the narrow , inner , on - axis cavity of the disk wind , which is set to have zero ( i.e. , negligible ) density .",
    "this cavity is too thin to see in the larger scale panels , but it is resolved by the logarithmic grid spacing .",
    "the evolution of the protostar depends on its accretion history .",
    "zth14 calculated the protostellar properties with a detailed stellar evolution model by @xcite and @xcite , self - consistently adapted to the turbulent core model accretion rates . when the flow reaches the stellar surface , the accretion energy , @xmath76 , is released there .",
    "following zth14 , we treat this accretion luminosity and the internal stellar luminosity as being emitted isotropically with a single effective temperature , @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath78",
    ". we will refer to @xmath77 as the stellar effective temperature .",
    "zth14 also included the effects of the accretion energy released at the disk surfaces in the dust temperature calculation .",
    "however , in this study , we neglect the ionizing photons from the disk surface , since its surface temperature is not high enough to emit significant amounts of ionizing flux .",
    "if the protostar rotates at almost its breakup velocity , it distorts the structure of the star .",
    "this effect leads to nonuniform surface temperatures : the polar region is hotter than the equatorial region @xcite .",
    "however , the degree of rotation of massive protostars is quite uncertain , and thus for simplicity we adopt a spherical model with a single surface temperature as a first approximation .",
    "figure [ fig_protost ] shows the evolution of protostellar properties with protostellar mass : the stellar radius , luminosity and effective temperature were calculated by zth14 , while the evaluation of ionizing flux will be described in  [ sec_ionlum ] . in the fiducial case with @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the stellar radius reaches a maximum at @xmath81 when the kelvin - helmholz time becomes as short as the accretion time ,",
    "after which the protostar is able to begin contraction towards the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) @xcite . due to this variation in radius ,",
    "the effective temperature increases strongly for @xmath82 . comparing to the fiducial case",
    ", the mass at which the stellar radius has a maximum is larger in the higher @xmath83 case and smaller in the lower @xmath83 case .",
    "this is because a higher @xmath84 causes higher accretion rates ( eq .",
    "[ eq_mdot ] ) , which make the accretion timescale shorter and also lead to increased swelling of the protostar .",
    "the total stellar h - ionizing photon luminosity @xmath27 is evaluated as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the frequency , @xmath87 is the lyman limit frequency , and @xmath88 is the luminosity per frequency interval ( i.e. , the stellar spectrum ) . the stellar atmosphere model of @xcite is adopted to estimate @xmath88 , which covers wide ranges of effective temperature and surface gravity .",
    "the variation of ionizing luminosity is sensitive to the effective temperature and varies by orders of magnitude ( bottom panel of figure [ fig_protost ] ) . in the fiducial case of group",
    "a , the ionizing luminosity is as small as @xmath89 at @xmath90 , and quickly increases to @xmath91 or larger in the kelvin - helmholz contraction phase . even at",
    "the same mass of @xmath92 , the ionizing luminosity of model ah12 is five orders of magnitude smaller than that of model al12 .",
    "therefore , the accretion history and the detailed stellar evolution calculation are essential to study the ionization structure .",
    "we note that the obtained ionizing photon luminosities are somewhat lower than those in figure 2 of @xcite due to improved calculation of the effects of line blanketing .",
    "we calculate the extent of the ionized regions using our previously developed radiative transfer code @xcite , which allows a treatment of both direct and diffuse ionizing radiation fields .",
    "we consider only the ionization of hydrogen , ignoring helium and other elements . if the stellar effective temperature is high , @xmath93 , we would underestimate the electron density by about @xmath94 due to singly ionized helium , which would then enhance free - free emission by about @xmath95 .",
    "the gray approximation for the photoionization calculation is adopted , where the frequency of ionizing photons is represented by the mean value .",
    "the equation of radiative transfer along a ray is @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei , @xmath98 is the irradiance intensity , @xmath99 is the mean intensity , @xmath100 is the mean energy of ionizing photons , @xmath101 is the mean photoionization cross - section of the hydrogen atom , @xmath102 is the radiative recombination coefficient to the ground state , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are neutral ( atomic ) and ionized fractions of h , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are absorption and scattering cross sections of dust grains per h nucleon .",
    "the first term of the right - hand side represents the consumption of ionizing photons by neutral hydrogen , the second term describes the re - emission of ionizing photons by recombinations directly to the ground state , and the third and fourth terms correspond to absorption and scattering by dust grains , respectively .",
    "the local ionization fraction of h , @xmath104 , is calculated from the balance between photoionization , recombination and advection , @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the velocity of the disk wind gas , @xmath109 is the recombination coefficient for all levels ( so - called case a )",
    ". the advection term on the left - hand side of this equation can be especially important near the ionization boundary .",
    "the recombination rates , @xmath102 and @xmath109 , are functions of temperature of the ionized gas .",
    "the mean values of the photon energy and hydrogen cross - section are evaluated from the stellar spectra for each model , @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the frequency dependent cross - section of the hydrogen atom .",
    "we adopt the fitting formulas from @xcite for the recombination rates @xmath102 and @xmath112 , and the hydrogen cross - section @xmath111 .",
    "the absorption and scattering properties of dust in these  regions are quite uncertain .",
    "we adopt @xmath105 and @xmath106 equal to zero in regions where the temperature history has exceeded the dust destruction temperature ( 1,400  k ) in the thermal radiation calculation by zth14 ( i.e. , there is a dust - free inner region of the disk wind ) , and elsewhere they are fixed at @xmath113 from a typical value of the diffuse interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the effect of variation of dust grain properties , i.e. , sizes , abundances , compositions , is deferred to a future paper .",
    "we conduct axisymmetric two dimensional calculations to solve equations ( [ eq_rt ] ) and ( [ eq_xhii ] ) , using our developed ray - tracing radiative transfer code . in the previous work of @xcite ,",
    "the code solved the transfer equation by the method of short characteristics , which involves only the cells next to the point under consideration @xcite . here , we update the code implementing the method of long characteristics . with this method , the transfer problem is solved along the rays from the domain boundary to each point , which leads to less numerical diffusion and treats the diffuse radiation more accurately than the short characteristics method .",
    "the computational domain is a cylindrical region with radial and vertical coordinates @xmath114 and @xmath115 , assuming equatorial plane symmetry . the ionizing photon source is a sphere located at @xmath116 with a radius of @xmath117 , which represents the accreting star .",
    "we denote the distance from the center of the star as @xmath118 .",
    "the spatial grids for radial and vertical directions are set to be spaced logarithmically since the inner region has finer structures .",
    "the entire computational domain is resolved with a @xmath119 grid .",
    "the radiation intensity @xmath98 is a function of location and also direction : @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the polar and azimuthal angles , respectively .",
    "the radiation emitted from the vicinity of the star has very fine angular structure when it reaches the outer boundary , i.e. , @xmath123 . to resolve these fine structures",
    "while still saving computational costs , the angular resolutions of @xmath121 and @xmath122 are configured to vary depending on location @xmath124 . in the @xmath121 direction , the radiation arriving from directions with @xmath125 , which comes from the vicinity of the star , is resolved with a high resolution of @xmath126 , while the radiation arriving from @xmath127 is resolved by @xmath128 . in the @xmath122 direction , based on the tangential plane method @xcite , the radiation emitted from near the axis and from the opposite direction , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , is resolved with high resolution of @xmath131 , while the radiation from @xmath132 is resolved by @xmath133 .",
    "we also conduct resolution tests for the fiducial case with grids of @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the obtained ionized structures are consistent at these resolutions and free - free fluxes change by less than @xmath136 at radio frequencies from @xmath137@xmath138 .    in this first work",
    "we study the photoionization of the disk wind , and do not allow photoionization of gas in the disk or infall envelope components of the model .",
    "such photoionization would enhance the mass loss rate that is being injected into the disk wind , i.e. , by photoevaporation , and would thus change its density structure and also the star formation efficiency .",
    "this feedback of photoevaporation will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "the temperature of the ionized gas is important to evaluate recombination rates and to study free - free emission for observational diagnostics .",
    "the photoionized gas temperature is regulated to around @xmath139 by the balance of heating and cooling processes .",
    "the dominant heating process is photoionization and the main cooling processes are radiative cooling of collisionally excited metal lines , recombination of h , and free - free emission .",
    "it is computationally expensive to take into account all heating and cooling processes at every step of the radiative transfer calculation , and thus here we introduce an approximate treatment .",
    "the heating rate by photoionization depends on the stellar spectrum .",
    "also , heating and cooling rates are both mostly sensitive to the density .",
    "therefore , we treat the photoionized gas temperature , for each stellar model , as a function of the local density , i.e. , @xmath140 .",
    "we evaluate @xmath140 from the volume average temperature of static  regions with uniform densities in the range @xmath141@xmath142 using version 13.03 of cloudy  @xcite .",
    "this approximate approach is appropriate since a uniform density  region for each stellar model is almost isothermal as shown below .",
    "it should be noted that the ionized gas temperature is also sensitive to the metallicity of the gas , and we assume solar metallicity in this study .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig_uniform ] shows the radial structure of an  region with uniform density of @xmath143 formed by the stellar radiation of the stellar model a24 .",
    "it can be seen that the  region has a sharp edge at @xmath144 where the ionization degree drops from near unity to near zero .",
    "the temperature is almost isothermal in the ionized region .",
    "we evaluate the typical photoionized gas temperature at @xmath145 as being @xmath146 from the volume average of this temperature for this stellar model .    in this way",
    ", we obtain photoionized gas temperatures over the density range of @xmath147@xmath142 for each stellar model .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig_uniform ] shows the photoionized gas temperature as functions of density , @xmath148 , for the stellar models a12 , a16 , and a24 .",
    "the temperatures of all models are around @xmath149@xmath150 for orders of magnitude of density variation .",
    "the temperature is typically higher at higher density .",
    "this is because the cooling is suppressed if the density exceeds the critical density of some of the cooling lines .",
    "we adopt these averaged temperatures to set @xmath151 as the local temperature of the ionized gas in our radiative transfer calculations .",
    "since the adopted temperature is evaluated based on static  region calculations , adiabatic cooling has not been included in this study .",
    "the adiabatic cooling rate , @xmath152 , is proportional to @xmath153 . on the other hand ,",
    "the radiative cooling rates in ionized regions are almost proportional to the square of density . since the density gradient in the disk wind is as steep as @xmath154 to @xmath155 , adiabatic cooling may not be negligible in low density regions far from the star .",
    "we compare the adiabatic cooling rate to the cooling rate evaluated by the static calculations . in the fiducial model of a16 ,",
    "adiabatic cooling would be @xmath156 of total cooling rate when @xmath157 and @xmath158 . as we will see in  [ sec_sed ] , the free - free flux at frequencies lower than @xmath159 is mainly provided from @xmath160 .",
    "therefore , we note that the seds obtained by our simplified modeling would be overestimated somewhat at @xmath161 .        using the obtained structures of the photoionized outflow",
    ", we estimate the free - free radio continuum emission . the equation of transfer for free - free emission is @xmath162 where @xmath163 and @xmath164 are the intensity and opacity of free - free emission , and @xmath165 is the planck function .",

    "the free - free emission is typically observed at @xmath179@xmath180 , while the thermal dust emission would usually be dominant at higher frequencies . however , for completeness , we calculate free - free emission over the frequency range of @xmath181@xmath182 .",
    "we also evaluate the hrl emission from the photoionized outflow . considering a h@xmath183 line , i.e.",
    ", the line from the transition @xmath184 , the opacity is @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the normalized line profile ( @xmath187 ) , @xmath188 is the population number in energy level @xmath189 , @xmath190 is the einstein coefficient of spontaneous emission , and @xmath191 and @xmath192 are the energy and wavelength of the h@xmath183 transition , respectively . here , for simplicity , we assume the case of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",

    "the mass loss rate is roughly proportional to the mass accretion rate , and thus the critical ionizing flux for the breakout is higher for higher-@xmath34 cases .",
    "the breakout does not occur at @xmath337 even in the low-@xmath34 case of model al08 .",
    "the typical flux for breakout is @xmath338@xmath339 in our numerical calculations , which is as high as the flux from the zams at about @xmath340@xmath341 .",
    "all models in this work reach @xmath342 at the final stage , however , it should be noted that there are almost as many stars between @xmath343 and @xmath344 as above @xmath342 . in the formation of such stars with @xmath345 ,",
    "the  region is confined during the main accretion phase and breakout occurs only towards the end of accretion when the outflow rate also decreases .    after first breakout at @xmath346 ,",
    "the photoionized region extends in polar angle . to ionize almost the entire outflow",
    ", the ionizing flux needs to increase by about one order of magnitude from the first breakout ionizing flux .",
    "this takes only @xmath2@xmath347 since the ionizing flux increases rapidly in the kh contraction phase .",
    "once the entire outflow is ionized , the expansion in polar angle of the  region slows down matching the increase of the outflow cavity opening angle , which has a timescale similar to the accretion time , i.e. , @xmath348@xmath349 .    our model of photoionized disk winds may also help to explain the short timescale variability that is seen in some uc / hc  regions @xcite and which has also been modeled in the radiative hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite .",
    "fluctuations in the accretion rate would also lead to changes in the outflow massloss rate , which would change the density and thus the extent of the photoionized region .",
    "changes could happen on outflow crossing timescales , i.e. , as short as @xmath350  pc / @xmath351  yr .",
    "our model makes prediction for the spectral and the size indices , i.e. , @xmath248 and @xmath352 , of the free - free emission . the free - free emission spectral index at 10  ghz is about @xmath353@xmath265 ( see  3.2.1 ) , which indicates that the outflow is partially optically thick .",
    "the apparent size of the observed free - free emission ( see  3.2.2 ) is as small as @xmath354 at 10 ghz and smaller at higher frequencies , scaling with size as @xmath355 , with the index of @xmath284 , even though the ionized region is larger than the core scale of @xmath356 after breakout .",
    "these frequency dependences are related to the density structure of the ionized outflow .",
    "a simplest analytical structure is a spherical wind with constant velocity , i.e. , @xmath357 where @xmath358 and @xmath359 are the wind mass loss rate and velocity @xcite .",
    "since the opacity for the free - free emission at radio frequencies is approximatly @xmath360 if the gas is isothermal , the optical depth rapidly decreases as @xmath361 .",
    "therefore , the outer region becomes optically thin and has less contribution to the total free - free flux even though the ionized gas extends to larger scales . in this spherical model ,",
    "the radius of the optically thick region scales as @xmath362 , and thus the total free - free flux , which is proportional to the flux from the optically thick region , is @xmath363 .",
    "additionally , as shown by @xcite , even with a bipolar jet geometry , the set of indices will be similar to the simple spherical wind if the jet is conical ( constant aperture angle ) , of constant velocity and ionization fraction , and is isothermal .",
    "thus the departure from the indices of @xmath364 is related to acceleration , collimation , thermal structure , or variation of ionization fraction @xcite .",
    "our wind model is more complex compared to the spherical wind or the conical jet , however the fundamental physics is the same and thus the values of its spectral and size indices are similar .      here , we compare general properties of our model with observed radio sources around massive protostars and show that the features of our theoretical models are similar to those of observed radio winds and jets .",
    "figure [ fig_comparison ] shows the properties of size , line width , radio and bolometric luminosities , and outflow momentum rate of our models and of observed radio sources . for our models ,",
    "size and free - free luminosity are measured at @xmath365 and line width is evaluated from h@xmath202 assuming an inclination angle of @xmath243 .",
    "the size is evaluated by the diameter at which half of the total radio flux of the system is emitted .",
    "as we have seen , the inclination angle does not affect these properties significantly at radio frequencies .",
    "note , the outflow momentum rate , @xmath63 , of our model shown in figure [ fig_comparison ] is obtained from the protostellar evolution calculation of zth14 rather than from an estimation via a synthetic observation .    in panel ( a ) of figure [ fig_comparison ] , we show how @xcite distinguished objects into three categories based on size and line width : uc  regions are @xmath366 and @xmath367 , hc  regions are @xmath368 and @xmath369 , and massive young stellar object ( myso ) wind sources are @xmath370 and @xmath371 . it should be noted that this classification of the radio sources is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "for example , @xcite defined uc  regions as having diameters @xmath372 and hc  regions as @xmath373 with emission measures @xmath374 .",
    "@xcite adopts a simpler definition only based on the above sizes .",
    "when we refer to data from @xcite and @xcite , we follow hoare et al.s classification . the line width of uc and hc  regions are derived from radio hrls , while those of wind sources are from ir hrls .",
    "the wind sources ( bn , w33a , s140 irs 1 , ngc 2024 irs 2 , gl 989 and gl 490 are plotted here ) are the smallest and fastest objects . comparing in those plots , our models reproduce the properties of wind sources quantitatively , with sizes of @xmath375 and line widths of @xmath376 .",
    "two of our models have broader line widths than @xmath377 ( @xmath378 for a12 and @xmath379 for c16 ) .",
    "these two models are at the beginning of  region expansion , and the ionized region is confined only near the axis where the wind velocity is highest .",
    "thus , their line width is exceptionally broad .",
    "the difference between uc / hc  regions and myso wind sources is more clearly seen in the ratio of radio and bolometric luminosities in panel ( b ) of figure [ fig_comparison ] .",
    "uc / hc  regions are more radio - loud than myso wind sources by two orders of magnitude or more .",
    "even though the average radio to bolometric luminosity ratio of our models are about one order of magnitude higher than those of myso wind sources , there is still overlap given their dispersions .",
    "@xcite found two empirical correlations related to the radio luminosity of observed radio jets : one is a correlation with bolometric luminosity ; the other is with outflow momentum rate : @xmath380 interestingly , those two correlations are consistent over a wide bolometric luminosity range of @xmath381 to @xmath382 ( dotted lines in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_comparison ] ) .",
    "myso wind sources from @xcite ( black circles ) also fall on the first correlation . the solid line in panel ( b )",
    "is the expected radio luminosity in the optically thin limit using the ionizing photon rate of zams models by @xcite , which represents the maximum radio luminosity from photoionized gas . at @xmath383 , however , there are radio jets that exceed this maximum value @xcite . it has been suggested that the single power law correlations of equations ( [ eq_ll ] ) and ( [ eq_pl ] ) indicates a common nature of ( ionized ) outflows from low - mass and high - mass protostars @xcite . since the photoionization properties differ greatly from low - mass to high - mass stars , this might imply that a different mechanism , i.e. , shock ionization , is responsible for the observed radio emission along these correlations .",
    "however , we find that the radio luminosities of our model agree reasonably well with both the correlations of eqs .",
    "( [ eq_ll ] ) and ( [ eq_pl ] ) , even though they are photoionized structures .",
    "we predict that there should be a transition to photoionization - dominated winds for massive protostars , but that in this regime the radio / bolometric luminosities and the outflow momentum rate may not differ too much from this empirical relation .",
    "the systematic differences of our models are towards somewhat higher values of radio luminosities by factors of 1.513 .",
    "this may be a signature of the initial stage of photoionization leading to enhanced radio fluxes .",
    "note , our models tend to be more massive than the observed sources , so more data in this range is needed .",
    "if the photoionized region is optically thin , the free - free emission is simply proportional to the ionizing photon flux rate @xcite .",
    "however , our model indicates much lower free - free flux than the optically thin limit ( panel ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig_comparison ] ) .",
    "first , this is because more than half of the emitted ionizing photons are absorbed at the innermost region of @xmath384 .",
    "this region is optically thick for the radio free - free emission , and thus the absorption there does not contribute to the total free - free flux . in the case of model a16 , @xmath385 of photons",
    "are absorbed inside @xmath386 .",
    "second , most of the rest of the photons , @xmath387 , escape from the system .",
    "those escaping photons do not induce free - free flux from the core scale , but contribute to the flux from the ambient clump gas , which is discussed below (  [ sec_ion_clump ] ) .",
    "the final reason is that the photoevaporation flow has so far not been included in our model .",
    "if the ionizing photon rate is high enough to ionize the disk and envelope surfaces , e.g. , in the case of model a24 , the outflow rate of ionized gas increases and the free - free flux should be enhanced . while the first and second reasons are physical , the last one is due to the incompleteness of our model .",
    "we will address photoevaporation and its feedback effects in a subsequent paper .",
    "our ionized outflow models typically have spectral indices with @xmath353@xmath265 ( fig . [ fig_sed ] ) , and size index with frequency of @xmath388 from free - free emission at 10  ghz ( fig . [ fig_img_nu ] ) .",
    "as discussed above , those indices are related to the density gradient of the outflow .",
    "the indices obtained by our calculations are consistent with some observed radio jets , such as mwc 349 ( @xmath389 and @xmath390 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and w75n(b ) ( @xmath391 and @xmath392 , * ? ? ?",
    "g345.4938 + 01.4677 , however , has the slightly steeper indices of @xmath393 and @xmath394 than our model , which may be interpreted as being due to a stronger degree of collimation and acceleration ( * ? ? ?",
    "* guzmn et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "we should notice that , even though our theoretical model has similar properties to those of the observed radio jets , there is still a lack of some physical processes in our model .",
    "the velocity of some jets is estimated to be as high as @xmath395 from the proper motion of associated lobes along the axes , e.g. , hh 80 - 81 @xcite and cep a hw 2 @xcite .",
    "similar to these sources , our wind models have high radio brightnesses and high velocities of @xmath396 near the axes ( figs .",
    "[ fig_n ] , [ fig_al ] , etc . ) . however , unlike our model ,",
    "some of lobes are found to have the radio emission with negative spectral indices , such as serpens @xcite , hh 80 - 81 @xcite , ceph a hw 2 @xcite , w3(oh ) @xcite , and iras 16547 - 4247 @xcite .",
    "these negative spectral indices can be interpreted as due to nonthermal synchrotron emission induced by strong shocks with the ambient gas @xcite , and this has been confirmed by the detection of linearly polarized emission in hh 80 - 81 @xcite . additionally , our simple axisymmetric model has not accounted for the possibility of outflow axis precession , which is apparent in iras16547 - 4247 @xcite .",
    "although the current number of sources with these features is relatively small , inclusion of such additional physics in our theoretical models , i.e. , shock ionization and outflow axis precession , are likely to be needed for a complete understanding of jet properties in massive star formation .",
    "such analysis is also deferred to a future paper .",
    "as we have seen , the properties of our models are consistent with the so - called  myso wind sources \" in @xcite and @xcite , and  radio jets \" with high bolometric luminosity in @xcite .",
    "in general , the main difference of  winds \" and  jets \" is the shape , i.e. , winds have relatively wide opening angles and jets are more collimated bipolar outflows . this difference could be related to evolutionary stage ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig_img ] ) . to clarify our view of the evolutionary sequence of massive star formation and its outflow launching mechanism ,",
    "further study is needed utilizing multi - wavelength observations to be compared with theoretical models .          finally , we comment on the ionization of the ambient clump .",
    "tens of percent of the total ionizing photon output escape along the outflow cavity ( fig .",
    "[ fig_escape ] ) .",
    "these photons are likely to ionize the ambient clump which would lead to enhanced radio luminosity .",
    "we estimate features of these extended ionized regions , as described in ",
    "[ sec_esc ] .",
    "figure  [ fig_comparison_b ] shows the comparison of our ionized clump models and observed sources ( the observational data are the same as in fig .  [ fig_comparison ] ) .",
    "the strmgren - based models of ionized ambient clumps typically have the size of @xmath397 and line widths of @xmath398 , and large radio luminosities of @xmath399 , which are larger in size , narrower in line width , and more radio loud than the ionized outflow models .",
    "these features are roughly consistent with observed uc / hc  regions , except the line widths are broader in the observed systems . however , this difference is not surprising as the theoretical models include only thermal broadening and so give minimum widths .",
    "we conclude that some uc / hc  regions may be formed by the escaping photons from massive protostars with radio jets or winds . in this study",
    ", the ionized clump features are evaluated based on the simple strmgren analysis (  [ sec_esc ] ) . for more detailed analysis , planned for future work , one needs to model more accurately the structure and kinematics of ambient clump gas , including its perturbation by the outflow , to better understand the connection of radio winds / jets and uc / hc  regions .",
    "we have studied the structure , evolution and observational properties of photoionized disk wind outflows that are expected to be associated with massive protostars forming by core accretion .",
    "specifically , we have followed the quantitative properties of the turbulent core accretion model of @xcite and follow - up protostellar evolution , disk wind and ir continuum radiative transfer models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we calculated the transfer of ionizing photons and obtained the photoionized structure .",
    "the disk wind starts to be ionized when the stellar mass reaches about @xmath340  @xmath342 , depending on the properties of the initial cloud core , due to the stellar temperature increase resulting from kelvin - helmholz contraction . at this moment",
    ", the photoionized region is confined to zenith angles of about @xmath340  @xmath244 , while the high density regions near the outflow axis and equatorial plane remain neutral . on the other hand , in the radial direction ,",
    "the photoionized region is unconfined , since the density gradient of the disk wind is steep .",
    "the disk wind is almost entirely ionized in about @xmath2  @xmath3 , and the photoionized region extends as the outflow opening angle increases .",
    "the outer disk surface is not ionized even though the diffuse radiation has been considered .",
    "this is because of the shielding effects of the inner disk and the disk wind .    using the obtained photoionized structures",
    ", we calculated radiative transfer of free - free continuum and hydrogen recombination line emission .",
    "the free - free emission exceeds dust emission at the radio frequencies lower than @xmath400 once the ionized region is formed .",
    "while shorter wavelength infrared flux from dust emission can depend on inclination of viewing angle , the radio flux from free - free emission is almost independent of inclination and its typical flux density is @xmath401@xmath402 at a distance of 1 kpc with a spectral index @xmath6@xmath7 the apparent size depends on frequency as approximately @xmath403 .",
    "the profile of @xmath404 has a fwhm of @xmath405 with broad wings .",
