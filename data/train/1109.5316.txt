    "portfolio optimization problems with an objective to exceed a given benchmark arise very commonly in portfolio management among both institutional and individual investors . for many hedge funds , mutual funds and other investment portfolios ,",
    "their performance is evaluated relative to the market indices , e.g. the s&p 500 index , and russell 1000 index . in this paper , we consider the problem of maximizing the outperformance probability over a random benchmark through a dynamic trading with a fixed initial capital .",
    "specifically , given an initial capital @xmath0 and a random benchmark @xmath1 , how can one construct a dynamic trading strategy @xmath2 in order to maximize the probability of the  success event \" where the terminal trading wealth @xmath3 exceeds @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath4 ?    in the existing literature ,",
    "outperformance portfolio optimization has been studied by @xcite among others .",
    "it has also been studied in the context of quantile hedging by fllmer and leukert @xcite . in particular , fllmer and leukert",
    "show that the quantile hedging problem can be formulated as a _ pure _ hypothesis testing problem . in statistical terminology",
    ", this approach seeks to determine a _",
    "test _ , taking values 0 or 1 , that minimizes the probability of type - ii - error , while limiting the probability of type - i - error by a pre - specified acceptable significance level .",
    "the maximal success probability can be interpreted as the _ power _ of the test .",
    "the fllmer - leukert approach permits the use of an important result from statistics , namely , the neyman - pearson lemma ( see , for example , @xcite ) , to characterize the optimal success event and determine its probability .",
    "on the other hand , the outperformance portfolio optimization can also be viewed as a special case of shortfall risk minimization , that is , to minimize the quantity @xmath5 for some specific risk measure @xmath6 . as is well known ( see @xcite )",
    ", the shortfall risk minimization with a convex risk measure can be solved via its equivalent _ randomized _ hypothesis testing problem .",
    "in fact , the problem to maximize the success probability @xmath7 is equivalent to minimizing the shortfall risk @xmath8 with respect to the risk measure defined by @xmath9 for any random variable @xmath10 .",
    "however , this risk measure @xmath6 does not satisfy either convexity or continuity .",
    "hence , a natural question is :    1 .",
    "is the outperformance optimization problem equivalent to the randomized hypothesis testing ?    in section  [ sec:31 ]",
    ", we show that the outperformance portfolio optimization in a general incomplete market is equivalent to a pure hypothesis testing .",
    "moreover , we illustrate that the outperformance probability , or equivalently , the associated pure hypothesis testing value , can be strictly smaller than the corresponding randomized hypothesis testing ( see examples  [ exm : pr ] and [ exm : bin ] ) .",
    "therefore , the answer to ( q ) is negative in general .",
    "this also motivates us to analyze the sufficient conditions for the equivalence of pure and randomized hypothesis testing problems ( see theorem  [ thm : np ] ) . in turn , our result is applied to give the sufficient conditions for the equivalence of outperformance portfolio optimization and the corresponding randomized hypothesis testing problem ( see theorem  [ thm : qhic ] ) .",
    "the main benefit of such an equivalence is that it allows us to utilize the representation of the randomized testing value to compute the optimal outperformance probability .",
    "moreover , the sufficient conditions established herein are amenable for the verification and are applicable to many typical finance markets .",
    "we provide detailed illustrative examples in section  [ sec : cm ] for a complete market and section  [ sect : stochvol ] for a stochastic volatility model .    among other results ,",
    "we provide an explicit solution to the problem of outperforming a leveraged fund in a complete market . in a stochastic volatility market , we show that , for a constant or stock benchmark , the investor may optimally assign a zero volatility risk premium , which corresponds to the minimal martingale measure ( mmm ) .",
    "this in turn allows for explicit solution for the success probability in a range of cases in this incomplete market . with the general form of benchmark",
    ", the value function can be characterized by hjb equation in the framework of stochastic control theory .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sect - hypo ] ,",
    "we analyze the generalized composite pure and randomized hypothesis testing problems , and study their equivalence .",
