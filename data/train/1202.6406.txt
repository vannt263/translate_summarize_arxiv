    "many promising methods to generate cluster states using solid - state qubits have been proposed  @xcite . however , since these states are not the ground states of spin hamiltonians with typical qubit - qubit interactions of ising , @xmath0 , and heisenberg form  @xcite , preserving them against the time evolution generated by these spin hamiltonians remains a critical issue .",
    "one of the established universal resources are two - dimensional ( 2d ) cluster states .",
    "another promising candidate is the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) state on the honeycomb lattice  @xcite , a resonance valence bond ( rvb ) type state which is a special projected entangled pair state ( peps )  @xcite .",
    "yet , the aklt state requires non - trivial hamiltonians with spin greater than 1/2 , which are not easy to realize in solid - state systems .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new method for preserving initially prepared cluster states .",
    "our approach relies on manipulating a two - body hamiltonian using pulse - sequence techniques developed in the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) context  @xcite .",
    "we show that , starting from the ising and @xmath0 models , one can induce an effective dynamics described by a stabilizer hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the correlation operators and the direct product runs over all nearest neighbors of the lattice site @xmath3 ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the pauli matrices ) .",
    "combined with cluster state generation methods  @xcite , our scheme facilitates stable one - way quantum computing .",
    "we assume the original hamiltonian to be of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a single - qubit part and @xmath8 the interaction part .",

    "for example in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) qubit array , @xmath18 can be generated by the time evolution operator @xmath19 .",
    "however , it is not evident how to obtain a sum like @xmath20 from the single - qubit hamiltonian .",
    "most fabricated solid - state qubit systems are nano - devices , because a smaller size makes them more robust to decoherence .",
    "an example are quantum dot systems where smaller dots have larger energy - level spacing .",
    "since with diminishing size it becomes difficult to address these devices individually , it is of interest to consider switching on / off @xmath21 and @xmath8 independently .",
    "we will show that , by using appropriate pulse sequences , this is possible even if we start from an @xmath22-@xmath23 hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "desirable quantum states are preserved by a pulse sequence that is familiar in the nmr context  @xcite .",
    "we assume that each pulse is sufficiently strong such that interactions between qubits can be neglected during the pulse sequences .",
    "the time evolution of the system is described by the density operator @xmath24 whose time dependence is given by @xmath25 for time - independent @xmath26 .",
    "it is convenient to use the following schematic notation for this evolution : @xmath27 .",
    "then the process @xmath28 for @xmath29 corresponds to @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be chosen arbitrarily .",

    "its ground state is the originally prepared cluster state , which is therefore preserved .",
    "we now show how to construct the stabilizer hamiltonian using the relation @xmath36 an important consequence of these equations is that , for @xmath37 , we can increase the order of the pauli - matrix terms as in @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for a 1d @xmath40-qubit chain ,",
