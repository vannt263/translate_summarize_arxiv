    "a main obstacle of quantum information is the decoherence of qubits .",
    "a quantum system inevitably interacts with its surrounding environment , and the interaction between the quantum system and its surrounding could lead to decoherence . therefore ,",
    "studying decoherence process @xcite and solving the problem @xcite have attracted much attention .",
    "many authors stressed that the decoherence is induced by the role of environment dissipation @xcite .",
    "as a candidate of quantum information , cavity qed has been widely studied in follow aspects : quantum network @xcite , producing entanglement@xcite and quantum teleportation @xcite , especially in the dissipative dynamics @xcite .",
    "this is because : the dissipation of cavity qed could be monitored in experiment @xcite , and this is valuable not only to the candidate of quantum information but also to the research of decoherence theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dissipative dynamics of the jcm in the dispersive approximation has been studied , and the influence of dissipation on the entanglement of the two subsystems was investigated . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors studied the field state dissipative dynamics of two - photon jcm and showed that the cavity dissipation affected the coherence properties of the field . in these studies ,",

    "the interaction between an atom and a single - mode field via two - photon process is a nonlinear one .",
    "giving the explicit solution of the dissipative dynamics of atom in a nonlinear process is very difficulty .",

    "however , the atom is the information depositor in a quantum information system @xcite ; it is more important to study the atomic decoherence property than that of the field . in the present paper ,",

    "is increased clearly in a same dissipative cavity .",

    "fig.3 also shows that the amplitude of local maximum and minimum of the curves is the largest in this case . because of the best initial coherence property of atom , the atom would best entangle with field",
