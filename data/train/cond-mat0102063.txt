    "electrorheological ( er ) fluids consist of highly polarizable particles in a nearly insulating fluid . upon the application of electric fields , the apparent viscosity of er fluids",
    "can be changed by several orders of magnitude , due to the formation of chains of and columns of particles across the electrodes in the direction of the applied field .",
    "the rapid transition between the fluid and solid phases renders this material the potential of important technological applications .    on the other hand ,",
    "the applied electric field used in most er experiments is usually quite high , and important data on nonlinear er effects induced by a strong electric field have been reported by klingenberg and coworkers @xcite .",
    "recently , the effect of a nonlinear characteristic on the interparticle force has been analyzed in an er suspension of nonlinear particles @xcite and further extended to a nonlinear host medium @xcite .",
    "these work confirmed the previous theoretical results that the attractive force between two touching spheres can have a quasi - linear dependence @xcite .    a convenient method of probing the nonlinear characteristic is to measure the harmonics of the induced polarization under the application of a sinusoidal ( ac ) electric field @xcite .",
    "when a nonlinear composite with nonlinear dielectric particles embedded in a host medium , or with a nonlinear host medium is subjected to a sinusoidal field , the electrical response in the composite will in general be a superposition of many sinusoidal functions @xcite .",
    "it is natural to investigate the effects of a nonlinear characteristic on the interparticle force in an er fluid which can be regarded as a nonlinear composite medium @xcite .",
    "the strength of the nonlinear polarization is reflected in the magnitude of the harmonics .    in this work",
    ", we will develop a self - consistent theory to calculate the ac response of a nonlinear er fluid .",
    "our theory goes beyond the simple point - dipole approximation and accounts for the multipole interaction between the polarized particles .",
    "we first consider an isolated spherical particle of radius @xmath0 and dielectric constant @xmath1 .",
    "the sphere is placed in a host medium of dielectric constant @xmath2 . when a time - dependent electric field @xmath3 is applied .",
    "the particle will be polarized and its surface charge will contribute to it a dipole moment @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the dipolar factor given by : @xmath6 . in er fluids ,",
    "when the particles get close to one another , they do not behave as point dipole and we have to consider the mutual polarization between the particles .",
    "next , we examine the effect of a nonlinear characteristic on the induced dipole moment .",
    "we concentrate on the case where the host medium have a nonlinear dielectric constant , while the suspended particles are linear .",
    "the nonlinear characteristic gives rise to a field - dependent dielectric coefficient .",
    "in other words , the electric displacement - electric field relation in the host medium is given by : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the nonlinear coefficient of the particles .",
    "we have assumed that the average field inside the host medium is uniform .",
    "this is called the decoupling approximation @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that such an approximation yields a lower bound for the accurate result @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in er fluids the frequency of the applied field is low ; we can assume both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are independent of frequency .",
    "as a result , the induced dipole moment is field - dependent and is given by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the field - dependent dipolar factor and is given by : @xmath13    when the polarized spheres approach to one another , they will be further polarized by the mutual polarization effect . as a result ,",
    "the point - dipole approximation breaks down and we must consider the multipole moments .",
    "let us consider a pair of nonlinear dielectric spheres of the same radius @xmath0 , separated by a distance @xmath14 .",
    "each of them has a dielectric coefficient @xmath1 . by using the method of multiple images @xcite",
    ", we deduce the total dipole moment of the spheres : @xmath15 the subscript @xmath16 denotes that the applied electric field is perpendicular to the line joining the centers of the particles ( i.e. , a transverse field ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is related to the separation between the particles : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the reduced separation . for a longitudinal field",
    ", we change the factor from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "the above formula can be generalized to account for a pair of dielectric spheres of the different sizes @xcite .",
    "the multiple images method was widely adopted @xcite to calculate the total dipole moment as well as the interparticle force .",
    "we should remark that the present multiple images method is an approximation only .",
    "in fact there is a more complicated images method for a dielectric sphere @xcite , which gives the exact image dipole moment of a dielectric sphere that placed in front of a point dipole .",
    "however , the numerical results of the present version of formula agree with the numerical solution of an integral equation method @xcite .    when we apply a sinusoidal electric field , i.e. , @xmath22",
    ", the induced dipole moment will vary with time sinusoidally . due to the nonlinearity of the particles ,",
    "the induced dipole moment will be a superposition of harmonics .",
    "in other words , we have : @xmath23 due to the inversion symmetry of the dielectric media , only the harmonics of odd order survive .",
    "the coefficient @xmath24 of the nth harmonic is given by : @xmath25    in what follows , we report results for the transverse field case only .",
    "the longitudinal field case is similar . in the next section , we will use the series expansion to obtain analytic expressions for the harmonics of the induced dipole moment .",
    "we will obtain the coefficient @xmath24 as a power series of the applied field @xmath26 .",
    "according to eqs.([trans - dielectric ] ) , the induced dipole moment of the dielectric spheres @xmath27 can be determined if we find the average field @xmath28 .",
    "the electric field inside the host medium can be conveniently calculated by considering the effective nonlinear dielectric constant of a two - component composite . for a two - component",
    "composite , the effective nonlinear dielectric constant @xmath29 is given by @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the volume fraction of the particles .",
    "for a pair of spheres inside a transverse field , the effective nonlinear dielectric constant can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath32 the average field of the host medium can be calculated by using eq.([effective - e ] ) : @xmath33 for a nonlinear characteristic [ eq.([nl - coefficient - host ] ) ] , we solve eq.([solve - local - field ] ) self - consistently @xcite . the average field inside the host medium as well as the dipole moment of the spheres [ eq.([trans - dielectric ] ) ] can be determined .",
    "it remains to examine how the higher harmonics of @xmath27 depends the nonlinearity .",
    "we first normalize the material parameters with the linear dielectric coefficient of the host @xmath2 : @xmath34 we then expand @xmath28 into a taylor expansion : @xmath35 where the expansion coefficient @xmath36 is given by : @xmath37_{\\widetilde{\\epsilon}'_m=1}.\\ ] ] hence the expansion coefficients do not depend on the applied field .",
    "similarly , we expand @xmath27 into a taylor expansion : @xmath38 where @xmath39_{\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_m'=1}.\\ ] ] it is easy to show that : @xmath40 . in the case of a weak nonlinearity ,",
    "i.e. @xmath41 , we can rewrite eqs.([local - field - taylor ] ) and ( [ dipole - taylor ] ) , keeping only the lowest orders of @xmath42 and @xmath43 : @xmath44 the first order term of @xmath42 gives the average field inside a linear dielectric host medium .",
    "similarly , the induced dipole moment is given by : @xmath45 it should be remarked that , from eq.([dipole - taylor ] ) , @xmath46 is the linear dipole moment @xmath47 : @xmath48 let us consider a sinusoidal applied electric field @xmath49 . by using the identity @xmath50 , we can expand @xmath51 in terms of the first and the third harmonics . by comparing eq.([dipole - expand ] ) with eq.([dipole - lower - order ] ) , we find : @xmath52 the above results show that the induced dipole moment must include the higher harmonics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the results show that @xmath53 also depends on @xmath54 .",
    "this is a nontrivial result as it implies that the first harmonic of the induced dipole moment depends on the strength of the nonlinearity .",
    "concomitantly , the higher harmonics should become more significant as @xmath26 gets higher .",
    "in the case of a higher applied field , we must include even higher order terms [ i.e. , higher powers of @xmath55 in the expansion of @xmath27 : @xmath56 again , by considering the identity @xmath57 , the harmonics are given by : @xmath58    consequently , in the case of nonlinear ac response , the convergence of the series expansion is questionable and a self - consistent formalism is needed . the self - consistent equation [ eq.([solve - local - field ] ) ] can help to solve for the average field . from eq.([local - field - taylor ] ) , ( [ dipole - taylor ] ) and ( [ dipole - lower - order ] ) , we find that : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are functions of a single variable , and @xmath62 ; this is the linear dipole moment of an isolated dielectric particle under a time - independent applied field @xmath26 .",
    "similar conclusion can be drawn for @xmath53 and @xmath63 .",
    "this demonstrates that we can use @xmath64 as a natural variable in the nonlinear composite problem @xcite .",
    "in this section , we perform numerical calculations to investigate the effects of a nonlinear characteristic on the harmonics of the induced dipole moment and the average electric field . as shown in section iii , the induced dipole moment of the dielectric spheres",
    "is affected by three factors : the strength of the applied field @xmath65 , the relative nonlinear dielectric coefficient of the host medium @xmath66 and the relative linear dielectric constants of the particles @xmath67 . in order to emphasize the effect of mutual polarization",
    ", we use a small reduced separation @xmath68 . from eq.([power - law ] ) , we can use @xmath69 as the variable to plot the numerical results .    before showing the numerical results",
    ", we consider the simple case of an isolated sphere . in this case",
    ", the average field inside the host medium can be solved exactly @xcite : @xmath70 when the applied field is small , the effect of nonlinearity is negligible .",
    "the average field is dominated by the first part of the above equation .",
    "since the volume fraction @xmath31 have to be small @xcite , the average field can be well approximated by : @xmath71 for a sinusoidal applied field @xmath72 , we have : @xmath73 which means that the first harmonic varies linearly with @xmath26 .",
    "in other words , a linear relation between @xmath74 and @xmath26 is an indication of a weak nonlinearity .    in fig.[acer - host - field ] , we plot the first and the third harmonics of the average field , with @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the volume fraction has a small influence on the nonlinear effects .",
    "the harmonics are plotted against @xmath78 .",
    "the first harmonic @xmath79 varies almost linearly with @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the third harmonics is small compared with the first harmonics .",
    "these results show that the average field can be approximated by eq.([average - field - approx ] ) .",
    "the numerical results of the average field suggest that the average field varies almost linearly with the applied field .",
    "however , as suggested by eq.([dipole - lower - order]),the dipole moment does not vary linearly with the applied field . in fig.[acer - host - dipole",
    "] , we plot the first and the third harmonics of the induced dipole moment .",
    "we divide the harmonics by @xmath62 , which is the linear dipole moment of an isolated dielectric particle under a time - independent applied field @xmath26 . in fig.[acer - host - dipole ] , we find that the first harmonics changes from positive to negative .",
    "this is because as the magnitude of the applied field increase , the field - dependent dipolar factor @xmath12 changes from positive to negative .",
    "hence the first harmonics changes its sign .",
    "next we examine the third harmonics of the dipole moment . the ratio @xmath81 increase with the applied field .",
    "the third harmonics is an evidence of nonlinear effects .",
    "the ratio increase significantly when the dielectric contrast between the particles and the host is small .",
    "in other words , a smaller dielectric contrast gives a larger nonlinear response .",
    "here a few comments on our results are in order . in the present study",
    ", we have examined the case of linear particles suspending in a nonlinear host .",
    "the case of nonlinear particles suspending in a linear host has already been studied by similar formalism @xcite .",
    "so far , we have not considered the frequency dependence of the dielectric constants of the host medium and the particles . in a realistic situation",
    ", the dielectric constants can decrease with the increase of the frequency . for simplicity",
    ", we may adopt the debye relaxation expression .    as we have obtained the expression for the induced dipole moments",
    ", we may take a step forward to calculate the interparticle force via the energy approach @xcite .",
    "we will find a time - dependent force @xmath82 but only its time average could be measured during an experiment . from the energy approach @xcite , @xmath83 we believe that the interparticle force in the ac case should differ significantly from that of the dc case of nonlinear er fluids because , as we have shown , the nonlinearity enters into the composite problem in a nontrivial way .",
    "results of the interparticle force will be published elsewhere @xcite .    in conclusion , we have considered the effects of a nonlinear characteristic on the er fluid under the influence of a sinusoidal applied field .",
    "we have calculated the harmonic components of the induced dipole moment as well as the average electric field .",
    "we have also examined the conditions for obtaining large ac response in er fluids .",
