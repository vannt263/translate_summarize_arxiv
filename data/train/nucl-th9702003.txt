    "for a long time it has been recognized that the exclusive ( e , e@xmath0n ) reaction in the quasielastic ( qe ) region is a powerful tool for studying the single - particle motion inside the nucleus , and is a testing ground for the different available nuclear models .",
    "one of the principal interests in the exclusive ( e , e@xmath0n ) reaction is to extract the nucleon spectral function @xmath5 from the cross section .",
    "this spectral function can be interpreted as the joint probability to remove a nucleon with momentum @xmath6 from the target nucleus and to find the residual system at an excitation energy @xmath7 .",
    "related to these spectral functions , spectroscopic factors and occupation numbers are often studied .",
    "they are a measure for the validity of the independent particle model ( ipm ) .",
    "the spectroscopic factor @xmath8 gives the _ probability _ to reach the single - particle state specified by the quantumnumbers @xmath9 in the residual nucleus at an excitation energy @xmath7 .",
    "the occupation number @xmath10 gives the number of nucleons in the single - particle state @xmath9 in the target nucleus and involves an integration of the spectroscopic factors over the complete excitation energy range @xcite . in the ipm the states above ( under ) the fermi level are completely empty ( filled ) and the total hole ( particle ) strength is situated at a fixed single - particle energy .",
    "the deviation from full ( no ) occupancy for the orbits below ( above ) the fermi level is a measure for correlations neglected in this mean - field approach .",
    "the occupation probabilities in even - even nuclei have been calculated within several theoretical frameworks .",
    "most models go beyond the mean - field approach and partially account for short- and/or long - range nucleon - nucleon correlations @xcite .",
    "occupation probabilities for the single - particle states which considerably deviate from the ipm value were obtained .",
    "moreover , it is demonstrated that the single - particle hole strength is fragmented over a broad range of energy . in particular ,",
    "occupation numbers for the proton @xmath11 orbit in @xmath4pb have been calculated varying from @xmath12 @xcite to @xmath13 @xcite pointing towards a strong depletion of this hole state in the ground state of @xmath4pb . from an experimental point of view",
    ", the ceres method @xcite was developed in an attempt to obtain absolute occupation numbers from experimental data .",
    "the model uses only relative spectroscopic factors and allows to account , in an approximate way , for the strengths at high missing energies , not accessible for experiment . with this method ,",
    "the @xmath11 occupation number in @xmath4pb is found to be @xmath14 .",
    "although the advantages of the quasielastic ( e , e@xmath0n ) process to study spectroscopic factors are widely recognized , the extraction of these factors from experiment is still not free of ambiguities .",
    "for example , depending on the model used in the analysis of the @xmath4pb(e , e@xmath0p ) reaction , the spectroscopic factor for the transition to the groundstate in @xmath15tl ( @xmath11 hole ) varies from @xmath16 @xcite to @xmath17 @xcite",
    ". a reliable determination of spectroscopic factors requires an accurate knowledge of the ( e , e@xmath0n ) reaction mechanism ( photoabsorption mechanism , final - state interaction ( fsi ) of the ejected nucleon with the residual nucleus ) and the exact treatment of the coulomb distortion of the scattered electrons , especially for heavy nuclei .    in this paper we present results from systematic calculations of ( e , e@xmath0p ) cross sections for a number of even - even target nuclei and various kinematical conditions and confront them with data taken at nikhef .",
    "the extracted spectroscopic factors are compared with the corresponding values deduced within other theoretical approaches @xcite .",
    "much attention is paid to the effect of electron distortion on the calculated cross section .",
    "it is pointed out that , especially for scattering off heavy nuclei , an exact treatment of these effects is highly needed in order to reproduce the shape of the measured cross sections and , consequently , to obtain reliable spectroscopic factors .",

    "table  [ shiftzr90 ] also shows that this shift towards lower @xmath184 is increasing with decreasing proton energy . the latter is easily explained as the real part of the optical potential induces a shift in the average measured proton momentum approximately given by @xcite @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the average value of the real part of the optical potential over the interaction region .    the inclusion of electron distortion effects in the model shifts the reduced cross section towards higher @xmath184 . the shift obtained from the ema is larger for @xmath187 mev than for @xmath202 mev since for the latter the reduced cross section at the peak position corresponds with a smaller momentum transfer .",
    "the complete cdwba calculation produces more than just a shift towards higher @xmath184 .",
    "the focusing of the electron beam in the vicinity of the target nucleus strongly modifies the maxima and minima of the reduced cross section with respect to the dwba results .",
    "since the extracted spectroscopic factors are sensitive to the behaviour of the reduced cross section at the peaks , an accurate prediction of this focusing effect is extremely important for an accurate deduction of these quantities .    in fig .",

    "this conclusion agrees with the findings of den herder in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that a slight reduction of the depth of the central imaginary part of the optical potential resulted in a much better agreement with the data for @xmath187 mev . with this modified optical potential an equally good fit of the elastic proton scattering data was obtained .",
    "this indicates that low energy ( p , p@xmath0 ) reactions are rather insensitive to the depth of the imaginary part in the nuclear interior .",
    "the ( e , e@xmath0p ) results , however , are sensitive to this part of the optical potential .",
    "the second maximum in the @xmath208 reduced cross section reflects the behaviour of the @xmath208 single - particle wave function in the nuclear interior . since the overlap is taken with the continuum wave functions , the second maximum is sensitive to the shape of the continuum wave function in the nuclear interior . given the uncertainties in the optical potential , this behaviour is not very accurately determined .",
    "as the @xmath209 single - particle wave function is more surface peaked , this also explains why the @xmath209 reduced cross section is not that sensitive to the depth of the imaginary part of the optical potential . clearly , the sensitivity of the reduced cross section to the parameterization of the optical potential is a general weakness of cdwba models but does not affect the general conclusions with respect to the role of electron distortion on the reduced cross section .",
    "the spectroscopic factors extracted from our @xmath3zr(e , e@xmath0p ) calculation are systematically larger than the values obtained by den herder @xcite .",
