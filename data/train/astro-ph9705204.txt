    "spiral galaxies show diffuse non - thermal emission at meter- and centimeter - waves from synchrotron emission by high energy electrons interacting with the interstellar magnetic field .",
    "this emission is intrinsically linearly polarized , with the electric vector perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field projected on the sky .",
    "mapping the polarization of this non - thermal radio emission from nearby spiral galaxies gives an image of their large - scale magnetic field structure ( ehle et al .",
    "1996 , klein et al .",
    "1996 , beck et al .",
    "1996 and references therein ) . in the milky way we might hope for a much more detailed picture of the magnetic field configuration to come from observations of the polarization of the non - thermal galactic background radiation . at high galactic latitudes",
    "this method gives good results , which agree qualitatively with other tracers of the interstellar magnetic field such as the polarization of starlight ( spoelstra , 1984 and references therein ; salter and brown , 1988 and references therein ) . at low latitudes",
    "the polarization of the galactic background presents a confused picture which has not yet been interpreted overall .",
    "the recent surveys by junkes , frst and reich ( 1987 ) and by duncan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) show how complex the distribution of polarization appears at low latitudes , even when observed by the relatively large beam of a single dish telescope .",
    "one of the difficulties of interpreting the polarization of the non - thermal galactic background comes from faraday rotation .",
    "direct measurement of faraday rotation toward pulsars and extragalactic continuum sources provides one of the most effective tracers of the galactic magnetic field structure at low latitudes ( rand and lyne 1994 , han et al .",
    "1997 , beck et al .",
    "1996 ) . for extended structure",
    ", however , small scale variations in the faraday rotation can cause small scale fluctuations in the position angle of the polarization which may be blended by the relatively large beam of a single dish telescope .",
    "small scale structure in the intrinsic position angle of the polarized emission can be blended in the same way , so that the beam average polarized intensity may thus be much less than the intensity present on smaller angular scales ( `` beam depolarization '' ) .",
    "an interferometer generally resolves away most of the unpolarized ( stokes i ) emission , since it is smoothly spread over angles of a few arc minutes or larger , but small angle variations in the position angle of the polarized intensity will cause strong `` fringes '' in stokes q and u , making the fractional polarization seem anomalously high , sometimes greater than 100% .",
    "an example of this effect was discovered by wieringa et al .",
    "( 1993 ) with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope .",
    "the lesson from that work is that aperture synthesis telescopes can detect small scale features in the stokes q and u components of the galactic background which may be completely undetectable in stokes i. unlike the large scale features mapped by single dish telescopes at high latitudes , at low latitudes such small angular size structures in the linear polarization could originate in quite * distant * emission regions .",
    "a powerful method for determining distances to galactic plane objects is by measuring the velocities of absorption lines at @xmath021-cm .",
    "distances to the intervening hi clouds that cause the absorption can be estimated from their velocities using a rotation model of the milky way ( see burton , 1988 ) . in order to understand the origin of the small scale structures in the galactic linear polarization it would be useful to measure spectra of the 21-cm line in absorption toward this emission .",
    "all past studies of 21-cm absorption have used stokes i emission for the background continuum .",
    "generally , compact continuum sources must be used because the strong , diffuse line emission masks the absorption , requiring subtraction of the `` off source '' spectrum , either explicitly or by the spatial filtering effect of an aperture synthesis telescope ( e.g. dickey and lockman , 1990 , and references therein ) .",
    "the 21-cm line does not show stokes q and u emission , so confusion with line emission is not a problem for absorption of linearly polarized continuum emission , unless the telescope does not adequately reject the stokes i spectrum from the measured stokes q and u spectra due to instrumental polarization .",
    "the required rejection is roughly a factor of one in 1000 , which is difficult to achieve , particularly for single dish telescopes .    in this project",
    "i have used the compact array of the australia telescope national facility to observe the stokes q and u components of the galactic non - thermal emission in a region at galactic longitude 329.5@xmath1 , latitude + 1.2@xmath1 .",
    "the 21-cm line is seen clearly in absorption , which allows us to place a lower limit of about 2 kpc for the distance to at least some of the polarized emission .",
    "the observations are described in section 2 , and the results discussed in section 3 .",
    "the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) has capabilities for measuring polarization which are superior to most other telescopes .",
    "the antenna and feed design is symmetric in reflection in azimuth to reduce instrumental polarization .",
    "its feeds are linearly polarized , which facilitates the calibration of the leakage terms between the polarizations and thus improves the quality of the stokes q and u measurements .",
    "typical values for the leakage ( calibrated using 1934 - 638 ) are less than 3% ; more important , the leakages are constant to better than 0.1% over several weeks .",
    "this leads to a rejection factor of less than 0.1% on - axis , i.e. the fraction of stokes i flux from a point source at the field center which spuriously appears as a stokes q , u , or v signal is less than @xmath2 .",
    "this factor degrades off - axis , so that a source 30 from the field center may show as much as 0.5% spurious linear polarization at @xmath020-cm . for this reason mosaic mapping of stokes q and",
    "u should be done with smaller spacing between pointing centers than is necessary for stokes i alone .",
    "all calibration and reduction of these data used the miriad package .",
    "analysis and display of the results used the aips package .",
    "this project was done in two steps .",
    "the first was a mosaic map of the region of strong linear polarization found by duncan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the area @xmath3 ( 190 pointings on a square grid of 20 steps in l and b ) .",
    "this mosaic was made using the 210 m configuration of the array in december , 1996 .",
    "the correlator configuration ( `` full_128_2 '' ) gives two bands of 128 mhz each , with full stokes parameters .",
    "each 128 mhz band is broken into 32 channels of 4 mhz .",
    "the two bands were centered at 1380 mhz and 1670 mhz .",
    "many channels were rejected due to interference , but there remain more then 50 mhz in each band which was quite clean .",
    "figure 1 shows both the stokes",
    "i emission in the mosaic area , and the polarized intensity over the area .",
    "some of the structures in the stokes q and u emission do not correspond with any discernable stokes i sources .",
    "these are similar to the features of wieringa et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ; they are almost certainly caused by small scale variations in the position angle of the linear polarization , which show up at the relatively high spatial frequencies sampled by the interferometer , whereas the stokes i emission is more smoothly distributed and so resolved away by the atca .",
    "for the second step , i selected a region of strong linear polarization and observed a single beam area for 16 hours using a high resolution correlator configuration ( `` full_4_1024_pol '' ) .",
    "this gives full stokes parameters over a 4 mhz band which is broken into 1024 channels separated by 3.91 khz ( 0.82 km s@xmath4 at 1420 mhz , rebinned to 2 km s@xmath4 during processing ) .",
    "the pointing center chosen for this second step was ( @xmath5 [ j2000 ] ) = ( 15:56:51.10 , -51:53:37.8 ) or ( l , b ) = ( 329.47,+1.16 ) .",
    "further mosaic observations and more extensive processing after the observations show that there are stronger linear polarization peaks in the region , so this field is not a particularly special one .",
    "the stokes q and u maxima are roughly 80 mjy per beam in this region , and the linearly polarized intensity , pi = @xmath6 is about 100 mjy per beam , where @xmath7 is the rms noise in the map . after tapering , the beam size was about 7.5x5.2 , so the conversion factor between jy per beam and kelvins of brightness temperature is 4.4 k/(jy per beam ) .",
    "thus the peak polarized brightness temperature is about 0.4 k. this is considerably stonger than the 100 to 150 mk polarized intensity seen by the parkes beam at 2.4 ghz in this area , though much less than the 8 k seen by wieringa et al . at 327 mhz in their strongest area .",
    "a grey scale map of the polarized intensity is shown on figure 2 .",
    "this was made using a line - free 1 mhz portion of the 4 mhz narrow band data ( 1418.9 - 1419.9 mhz ) .",
    "spectra of the polarized intensity , @xmath8 are shown for each of 16 areas of 5 square ( about one synthesized beam area each ) in the central region of the primary beam .",
    "the polarized intensity averaged over each square is reflected in the baseline intensity of each spectrum .",
    "the best absorption is obtained in the north - central part of the map , where the continuum polarized intensity reaches over 100 mjy per beam . in this region",
    "the deepest absorption is in the velocity range -25 to -40 km s@xmath4 .",
    "statistics of @xmath8 can be deceptive , since this is a positive definite quantity in which a varying rms noise across the band can mimic an emission feature .",
    "in fact the noise level does vary across the band , since the stokes i hi emission detected in the primary beam is strong enough to nearly double the 40k system temperature .",
    "the rms noise spectrum in stokes v gives a good estimate of the noise as a function of frequency in stokes q and u as well .",
    "this is 7 mjy rms off - line , rising to 10 mjy over the velocity range -120 to + 50 km s@xmath4 .",
    "this excess noise is coming entirely from stokes i , so it will enter the spectra on figure 2 without any correlation with the continuum polarized intensity shown in the grey scale .",
    "it will be reflected in @xmath8 both as increased fluctuations , and as an increased mean level in this velocity range .    in order to avoid the unpleasant statistical properties of the @xmath8 spectrum",
    ", we can look directly at the spectra of stokes q and u. the noise in these quantities remains zero mean , so that spurious emission features should not be created by the varying noise level across the band .",
    "this property is preserved even if we rotate the axes of q and u by angle @xmath9 to new axes , q and u , thus q = q cos@xmath9 - u sin@xmath9 and u = q sin@xmath9 + u cos@xmath9 .",
    "to best search for absorption of the polarized continuum , we choose for @xmath9 minus two times the position angle of the polarization measured 2 mhz off - line , i.e. @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the stokes parameters measured in the offline continuum band .",
    "( faraday rotation over such a small frequency offset is generally less than 10@xmath1 or so . ) with this choice of @xmath9 the new q contains all the linearly polarized background continuum flux but has no systematic bias due to noise .",
    "since the observed position angle is changing across the map , due in part to the absence of the zero spacings in the aperture synthesis and in part to real variations in the position angle , this rotation must be done for each pixel of the cube separately .",
    "spectra of q are shown in figure 3 for two areas with strong polarized continuum on figure 2 ( the second and third boxes in the second row ) .",
    "the deepest absorption lines are centered at -36 and -28 km s@xmath4 ; in both spectra the absorption at this velocity is very deep , peak optical depths are in the range 1 to 1.6 .",
    "the narrowest line has velocity width @xmath13 2.5 km s@xmath4 or less .",
    "there is a tentative absorption line near zero km s@xmath4 , and there is an apparent * emission * line at -66 km s@xmath4 . if it is real , this must be in fact an absorption line which intervenes between two regions of linear polarization with quite different position angles ( see next section ) .",
    "the strongest and most convincing absorption lines on figure 3 are those centered at -28 and -36 km s@xmath4 . assuming that these velocities are primarily due to galactic rotation , the implied kinematic distances are 2.0 and 2.5 kpc using the rotation curve of brand and blitz ( 1993 ) , or 2.3 and 2.9 kpc using the simple camm s law approximation with oort s constant a @xmath14 14 km s@xmath4 kpc@xmath4 ( burton 1988 ) . alternatively ,",
    "if the cloud is beyond the sub - central point , then the implied distances are 12.6 and 12.1 kpc . random velocities of hi clouds are typically 6 km s@xmath4 , so the error on these distances is about 20% .",
    "the weaker line near zero km s@xmath4 is probably due to local gas , if it is real .",
    "the most interesting question for the polarized background is whether the positive line at -66 km s@xmath4 is real .",
    "this is at about the 4-sigma level , so we can not give it high confidence , although it appears in several positions on the map ( figure 2 ) .",
    "if it is real , it would imply distances of either 4.0 or 10.1 kpc .",
    "even at 10 kpc distance the line of sight is only 200 pc above the plane , so this is well within the thick disk of synchrotron emission .",
    "absorption lines in stokes q and u can take on very unconventional forms , including positive lines which mimic emission , very deep lines that go well below the zero point of the background , and lines which only change the position angle of the continuum , and not the intensity . the polarized continuum is emitted in various regions along the line of sight .",
    "the linear polarization of these various contributions adds together more or less as a random walk on the q - u plane , depending on the coherence of the magnetic field on large scales .",
    "a long line of sight across the inner galaxy must traverse regions of reversal of the large scale field , as well as many small scale changes of the random field component .",
    "in addition , intervening regions of high electron density cause faraday rotation of the emission from behind them ; the change in @xmath15 can be a large angle at @xmath021-cm . for comparison , in the field shown on figure 1",
    "there are several pulsars with known rotation measures , varying from + 9 to -560 radians m@xmath16 .",
    "not having the zero - spacing information , it is not possible to map the rotation measure over the field , but undoubtedly there are large variations on a range of angular scales .",
    "an absorption line from an intervening hi cloud can affect the intensity and position angle of the net linear polarization in a variety of ways . in the case of significant internal faraday dispersion along the line of sight",
    "( ehle and beck 1993 , burn 1966 , spoelstra 1984 ) , an absorption line near the front side of the emission region has the effect of decreasing the faraday depth , and so increasing the polarization .",
    "this could be the situation for the line at -66 km s@xmath4 , which appears positive . if there are two regions of polarized emission at different distances along the line of sight whose position angles @xmath15 differ by nearly 90@xmath1 , then an absorption line from a cloud between the two can be either positive or very negative , i.e. well below zero , depending on which of the two has stronger polarized intensity .",
    "in the same way , it is possible to see spectral lines in stokes q and u even in directions where the continuum polarized intensity is zero , if the line of sight contains several emission regions whose polarization vectors roughly cancel and there are optically thick hi clouds between them .",
    "this may be the reason why the line at -66 km s@xmath4 appears with roughly equal strength in some positions on figure 2 where the continuum level has dropped to less than 50 mjy per beam . since the noise level in the spectra on figure 3 is high enough that only the lines at -36 and -28 km s@xmath4 are detected above 5 @xmath17 , and these lines",
    "look like conventional absorption lines of high optical depth , i must defer claims for such unconventional absorption lines as that at -66 km s@xmath4 until more observations can be done .",
    "in addition to the possibilities for determining distances to the various contributions to the polarized continuum background , @xmath021-cm absorption offers the possibility of mapping the angular distribution of the cool hi gas on scales of many arc minutes or even degrees .",
    "figure 2 shows that the narrow , deep absorption line at -28 km s@xmath4 extends over several synthesized beam areas , but does not cover uniformly the entire 30 primary beam area .",
    "thus the cool cloud must be larger than @xmath18 3 pc but smaller than @xmath18 20 pc .",
    "the spatial structure of the absorption is reminiscent of maps of 21-cm absorption toward extended , bright continuum sources such as hii regions and supernova remnants ( e.g. troland , heiles and goss , 1989 ; liszt , braun , and greisen 1993 ) . in the future",
    ", this type of observation may provide large scale maps of the atomic gas in cool interstellar clouds , for comparison with co maps and other tracers of the dense phases of the interstellar medium .",

    "some of these are prominent also in linear polarization .",
