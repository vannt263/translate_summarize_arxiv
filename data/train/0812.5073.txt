    "experimental realization of trapped bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in alkali metal atoms has triggered immense interest in understanding the various properties of ultra cold matter @xcite .",
    "these include four wave mixing , formation of vortices , bright solitons , dark solitons , gap solitons , interference patterns and domain walls in binary becs  @xcite .",
    "an interesting dynamical feature in the context of bose - einstein condensation is the formation of matter wave solitons  @xcite .",
    "for example , dark solitons @xcite and gap solitons @xcite were experimentally observed in becs with repulsive interactions , whereas bright solitons were demonstrated in systems with attractive interactions  @xcite .",
    "the recent experiments at heidelberg and hamburg universities have shown the formation of dark solitons , their oscillations and interaction in single component becs of @xmath0 rb atoms with confining harmonic potential  @xcite .",
    "these experimental results have been augmented by extensive theoretical work including predictions on bright and dark matter wave solitons  @xcite , lattice solitons @xcite , and soliton trains @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a bec at absolute zero temperature is usually described by the mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation  @xcite , which is a generalized form of the ubiquitous nls equation@xcite , for the wave function of the condensate .",
    "the nls equation and its generalizations are widely used in the nonlinear optics literature  @xcite to describe the evolution of coherent light in a nonlinear kerr medium , envelope dynamics of quasi - monochromatic plane wave propagation in a weakly dispersive medium , high intensity pulse propagation in optical fibers and so on .    as is well known the nls equation in one space and one time dimension",
    "is a completely integrable soliton system  @xcite : it possesses bright solitons in the focusing case , while dark solitons exist in the defocusing case . on the other hand ,",
    "the gp equation which is a three space and one time dimensional nonlinear evolution equation , is not integrable in general , but can admit exact solutions only in very special cases .",
    "in general , the gp equation has to be analyzed numerically or by approximation methods . for the cigar - shaped trap potential",
    "when the transverse linear oscillator length is much smaller than the longitudinal length , the 3d gp equation can be reduced to the effective 1d gp equation by assuming the kinetic energy of the longitudinal excitations and the two - body interaction energy of the atoms are of the same order , while both are much less than the kinetic energy of the transverse excitations  @xcite . to obtain bright and dark soliton solutions ,",
    "its quasi-1d version has to be analyzed essentially numerically .",
    "interestingly , some of the soliton solutions in the presence of regular harmonic confinement , with appropriately tailored gain or loss , have been shown to exhibit collapse and revival phenomena , with an increase in amplitude .",
    "for example , hulet and his co - workers observed the growth of a condensate of trapped @xmath1li atoms with attractive interaction and subsequent collapse @xcite , and miesner et  al .",
    "measured the rate of growth of a @xmath2na condensate fed by a thermal cloud @xcite .",
    "such a growth of a bec from thermal vapor was also experimentally realized for atoms of @xmath0rb  @xcite .",
    "several methods have been introduced theoretically to account for the growth of bec @xcite .",
    "the gp equation with the complex linear gain or loss term , often referred to as gp gain equation , was used to model this type of bec dynamics by drummond and kheruntsyan  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , as the condensate grows , the center of mass oscillates in the trap .",
    "the gp gain equation is of special importance in the field of atom laser , which is a device that produces an intense coherent beam of atoms by stimulated process @xcite . in recent years",
    ", several attempts have been made to understand the dynamics of bec by studying the gp gain equation  @xcite .",
    "further , there has been an increased interest during recent times in studying the properties of becs with time varying control parameters . in particular ,",
    "investigations have been made over a decade or so to understand the properties of condensates under    1 .",
    "the temporal variation of atomic scattering length which can be achieved through feshbach resonance  @xcite , 2 .",
    "inclusion of appropriate time - dependent gain or loss terms which can be phenomenologically incorporated to account for the interaction of atomic cloud or thermal cloud  @xcite , 3 .",
    "periodic modulation of trap frequencies@xcite and so on .",
    "earlier studies on becs have shown that a suitable periodic modulation of scattering length can stabilize the condensate against collapse @xcite . however , there are certain occasions where a sign alternating nonlinearity and increase in the frequency of oscillations result in the acceleration of collapse  @xcite . in this connection ,",
    "a systematic study on the condensates under the influence of time - dependent parameters which can be achievable through experiments is of considerable importance .",
    "most of the theoretical studies on the matter wave solitons in becs have been carried out using either numerical or certain approximation ( perturbation ) methods  @xcite .",
    "for example , ruprecht et  al  @xcite have shown the existence of bright soliton solutions in weakly interacting 1d and 2d becs by solving the corresponding gp equations numerically . in an",
    "another context , prez - garca et  al  @xcite have shown the existence of bright soliton solutions to the gp equation with negative scattering length in highly asymmetric traps by using the multiple - scale approximation method , while busch and anglin  @xcite have shown the motion of dark solitons in trapped effective 1d bec by using a multiple time scale boundary layer theory . on the other hand",
    ", there are only a few exact analytical methods available in the literature  @xcite to deal with the gp equation . in this connection",
    "it is worth mentioning that serkin et  al  @xcite have constructed exact soliton solutions by relating the effective 1d gp equation to the compatibility condition of a lax pair which is in turn related to that of the lax pair of the 1d integrable nls equation using an inverse scattering transform ( ist ) method while atre et  al  @xcite transformed the gp equation to the unforced duffing equation and thereby derived soliton solutions from the elliptic function solutions of the duffing equation .",
    "also , perez - garcia et  al .",
    "@xcite obtain a similarity transformation connecting the nls equation with time varying coefficients and the autonomous cubic nls equation .",
    "in addition , there exists several other interesting works in the literature to construct exact soliton solutions of the 1d gp equation : specifically , for certain time - dependent atomic scattering lengths ( nonlinearity ) with ( i ) time independent homogeneous , linear and quadratic potentials without gain / loss term  @xcite , ( ii ) time independent expulsive parabolic potential without gain / loss term  @xcite , ( iii ) time independent expulsive parabolic potential and arbitrary constant gain / loss term  @xcite , ( iv ) tanh type modulated harmonic trap frequency without gain / loss term  @xcite , explicit growing / decaying type solutions have been constructed . in the optical soliton context , in ref .",
    "@xcite exponentially growing solutions have been constructed for either constant atomic scattering length or zero potential case with a specific tanh type dissipation term . however , a more detailed analysis for bright and dark soliton solutions in quasi-1d bec with time - dependent atomic scattering length , harmonic trap frequency and gain / loss term is of considerable present interest from an experimental point of view .    in this paper",
    "we bring out a large class of bright and dark soliton solutions by simply mapping the effective 1d gp equation onto the standard nls equation , following the earlier works in the literature  @xcite .",
    "in particular we show that the effective 1d equation resulting from the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation in confining as well as expulsive potentials with time varying parameters , namely the scattering length , gain / loss term and trap frequency , can be transformed into the standard soliton ( bright / dark ) possessing , completely integrable 1d nls equation by effecting a change of variables of the coordinates and the wave function under certain condition , which is related to the scattering length , gain / loss term and the trap frequency .",
    "we consider both confining and expulsive harmonic trap potentials separately and treat the atomic scattering length , gain / loss term and trap frequency as experimental control parameters by modulating them as a function of time .",
    "we have deduced different kinds of bright / dark soliton solutions for different forms of the trap frequency by suitably tailoring the atomic scattering length and atom gain / loss term such as    1 .",
    "periodic oscillating solitons , collapse and revival of condensate , and snake - like solitons for time independent confining harmonic potential , 2 .",
    "stable solitons , soliton growth and decay , and formation of two - soliton bound state for time independent expulsive harmonic potential , 3 .",
    "oscillatory solitons , phenomena of collapse and revival of two - soliton like bound state formation of the condensate for double modulated periodic potential and 4 .",
    "stable solitons , soliton growth and decay for step - wise modulated potential .",
    "we also make comparisons of our results with the experiments of khaykovich et  al  @xciteand strecker et  al  @xcite obtained for @xmath3li atoms and for @xmath0rb atoms  @xcite .",
    "further , we also compare our results with the theoretical results of atre et  al  @xcite and serkin et  al  @xcite .",
    "it may be further noted that in experiments the matter wave solitons  @xcite have been observed within few micrometer ( @xmath4 m ) lengths and times up to the order of few ms . in the present paper",
    "we choose the soliton parameters such that the length ( @xmath4 m ) and time ( ms ) scales are well within the experimental regime .",
    "further , we have confined ourselves to the issue of stabilizing solitons by choosing the forms of modulated atomic scattering length and atom gain / loss term so as to balance each other .",
    "we have also considered here only the two - body interactions and neglected the three - body recombination loss which will introduce a quintic term in the gp equation which does not in general reduce to exactly integrable standard nls equation .",
    "such a case may be studied by the numerical and approximation methods .",
    "another interesting aspect of the temporal modulations is to look into the problem of parametric amplification , which however falls outside the scope of the present analysis and should be dealt with separately .",
    "it may also be noted that in the context of optical systems with varying coefficients , only picosecond optical solitons have been observed  @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gpe ] , we discuss the method of transforming cylindrically symmetric gp equation with time varying parameters such as the atomic scattering length , gain / loss and with both confining and expulsive harmonic potentials into an effective 1d gp equation with time varying parameters .",
    "then , we map the 1d gp equation to the standard nls equation by making use of suitable transformations , subject to a constraint on the forms of scattering length , gain / loss term and the trap frequency . next , in sec .  [ sec : solitons ] we deduce the generalized bright and dark matter wave soliton solutions of the gp equation from the soliton solutions of standard nls equation .",
    "we show the existence of various forms of bright and dark soliton solutions , their collapse and revival , and decay and growth for suitable choices of the condensate parameters with time independent confining and expulsive harmonic potentials in secs .",

    "[ con ] , we present a summary of the results and conclusions . in appendix",
    "[ app : validity ] , we have shown the validity criteria of the 1d gp equation for various forms of control parameters studied in this paper . in appendix",
    "[ app : solve ] , we give a brief description on the solution procedure of solving the restrictive condition for which the effective 1d gp equation can be mapped on to the standard nls equation .",
    "we also tabulate the possible solvable choices of the modulated trap frequency forms from the ricatti equation which specifies the restrictive condition in appendix  [ app : ricatti ] and provide a table of physical meaning of symbols used in the text in appendix  [ app : symbol ] .",
    "in the present study , we consider the gp equation with the inclusion of a complex gain or loss term of the form @xmath5 \\psi({\\mathbf r},t ) , \\label{3dgpe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the time varying s - wave scattering length , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is a cylindrical time independent harmonic trap , @xmath10 is a time - dependent harmonic trap along the @xmath11 direction which can be either confining or expulsive , @xmath12 depending on whether the interaction is attractive @xmath13 or repulsive @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the gain / loss term which is phenomenologically incorporated to account for the interaction of atomic cloud or thermal cloud .",
    "the plus sign of the @xmath15 term leads to the mechanism of loading external atoms ( thermal clouds ) into the bec by optical pumping while the minus sign of @xmath15 describes a bec that is continuously depleted ( loss ) of atoms .",
    "if the condensate is fed by a surrounding thermal cloud , then the condensate undergoes a periodic growth and collapse .",
    "the above equation has gained much importance in recent times to understand the growth and decay of the condensate due to time - dependent parameters  @xcite .",
    "however , one has to note that the parameters are varied sufficiently slowly so as to satisfy the adiabaticity criteria so that the wave - packet continues to evolve in the same quantum eigenstate as a function of time .",
    "a possible condition for the validity of the adiabaticity criteria  @xcite is that the characteristic time scale , say @xmath16 , of the variation of the modulated parameters is slow enough when compared with the instantaneous nonlinear eigenvalue @xmath17 of the nonlinear equation at time @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 .",

    "there are typical characteristic length scales to specify the condensate density .",
    "the confining frequencies of the harmonic trap potential ( @xmath22 ) , that is @xmath23 and @xmath24 , set the length scale for spacial size which are the transversive oscillator length @xmath25 and the longitudinal length @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , the effective mean - field nonlinearity introduces the length scale , namely the healing length @xmath27 , which is the distance over which the kinetic energy and the interaction energy balance  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath28 is the mean density of the condensate .",
    "the presence of the nonlinear term in the above gp equation ( [ 3dgpe ] ) complicates its solution procedure .",
    "one should note that it is very difficult to obtain closed form solution of eq .",

    "<S> we investigate the exact bright and dark solitary wave solutions of an effective one dimensional ( 1d ) bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) by assuming that the interaction energy is much less than the kinetic energy in the transverse direction . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , grses  @xcite and kundu  @xcite , we point out that the effective 1d equation resulting from the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation can be transformed into the standard soliton ( bright / dark ) possessing , completely integrable 1d nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation by effecting a change of variables of the coordinates and the wave function . </S>",
    "<S> we consider both confining and expulsive harmonic trap potentials separately and treat the atomic scattering length , gain / loss term and trap frequency as the experimental control parameters by modulating them as a function of time . in the case </S>",
    "<S> when the trap frequency is kept constant , we show the existence of different kinds of soliton solutions , such as the periodic oscillating solitons , collapse and revival of condensate , snake - like solitons , stable solitons , soliton growth and decay and formation of two - soliton like bound state , as the atomic scattering length and gain / loss term are varied . </S>",
    "<S> however when the trap frequency is also modulated , we show the phenomena of collapse and revival of two - soliton like bound state formation of the condensate for double modulated periodic potential and bright and dark solitons for step - wise modulated potentials .    ,    , and    bose - einstein condensates ; gross - pitaevskii equation ; nonlinear schrdinger equation ; soliton solutions .    </S>",
