    "in the last 15 years the pulsar magnetosphere was intensively studied in the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) limit , including ideal force - free electrodynamics @xcite , resistive force - free @xcite , and full relativistic mhd @xcite . while these solutions agree on the general shape of the plasma - filled magnetosphere , the origin of the magnetospheric plasma and the properties of particle acceleration necessary for production of observed radiation can not be addressed within the mhd approach , necessitating a kinetic treatment .",
    "recently , the aligned pulsar magnetosphere was studied with first - principles relativistic particle - in - cell simulations ( @xcite , hereafter , ps14 ; @xcite , hereafter , cb14 ; @xcite ) .",
    "ps14 showed that injecting abundant pairs everywhere in the magnetosphere drives the solution towards the force - free configuration .",
    "@xcite studied the transition between the disk - dome configuration and the filled solution by varying the rate of particle injection at the stellar surface . @xcite and @xcite studied one - dimensional polar cap cascade and found that in the region where current density along the magnetic field , @xmath1 , is below the goldreich - julian value , @xmath2 ( here",
    ", @xmath3 is the stellar angular velocity vector , and @xmath4 is the local magnetic field ) , particles in the space - charge - limited flow are not accelerated up to relativistic energies and do not produce secondary pairs .",
    "efficient particle acceleration , and , consequently , active pair formation , should thus be confined to the regions where @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "cb14 presented the first global aligned simulation with @xmath7 discharges and concluded that pair formation in the outer magnetosphere is required to produce the solution similar to force - free but with strong charge separation , consistent with sub - gj current flow in the polar cap region .",
    "this raised the question of whether high - multiplicity state of the magnetosphere is ever achieved , particularly in more realistic oblique rotators .",
    "the goal of this letter , therefore , is to describe the magnetospheres of oblique pulsars . for this , we construct relativistic particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations of the oblique pulsar with different prescriptions for populating the magnetosphere with plasma , focusing on solutions with realistic prescription for pair formation .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in  [ sec : numerical - models ] we describe our numerical method , in  [ sec : test ] we demonstrate the test solution with abundant neutral plasma supply , and in  [ sec : pulsar ] we present our results on three - dimensional magnetosphere structure of aligned and oblique rotators with pair production .",
    "to simulate the magnetosphere we use the 3d electromagnetic pic code tristan - mp @xcite . to a good accuracy , the star can be described as a rotating magnetized conductor .",
    "unipolar induction generates electric fields corresponding to a quadrupolar surface charge . in the limit of zero work function",
    "these charges can be pulled from the surface by the electric field , populating the magnetosphere with plasma .",
    "below we ignore the complications of extracting ions from the surface and assume that extracted positive charges are positrons .",
    "in addition to extraction of surface charges , we consider two scenarios for plasma supply .",
    "first , we extend the study of ps14 to oblique rotators by considering abundant neutral plasma injection in the whole magnetosphere .",
    "second , we add a more realistic prescription , which approximates pair production by magnetic conversion of photons and two - photon collisions ( see  [ sec : pairform ] ) .",
    "we use linearity of maxwell s equations to represent the electric field as a superposition : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the analytical field of the vacuum rotator @xcite , and @xmath10 is the field computed from pic particles @xcite . the same decomposition is done for the magnetic field . inside the conducting sphere , the plasma fields are forced to zero with a smoothing kernel , while the vacuum fields are set to corotation values .",
    "we use a cartesian grid of @xmath11 cells , with stellar radius @xmath12 cells , and light cylinder @xmath13 cells .",
    "particles penetrating into the star by two cells are removed .",
    "the outer walls have radiation boundary conditions for fields and particles .",
    "[ fig2:aligned ]     in this section we extend ps14 and build a force - free solution for the oblique rotator .",
    "neutral pair plasma is injected with zero velocity at a fixed rate in every cell within a sphere of @xmath14 , if the magnetization in a cell exceeds a certain limit , @xmath15 . here",
    ", @xmath16 is the absolute value of the magnetic field , and @xmath17 is the plasma density .",
    "this limiter helps to prevent overloading of the magnetosphere with plasma , particularly in the closed zone , while keeping the flow well - magnetized .",
    "the magnetization of our solution is @xmath18 near the pole ( around 20 particles per cell , local skin depth is 1.1 cells ) , and @xmath19 at the light cylinder ( around 1 particle per cell , local skin depth is 5 cells ) .    magnetic field in the plane defined by the magnetic moment @xmath20 and stellar angular velocity @xmath21 vectors for @xmath22 rotator",
    "is shown in fig .  1c , where color represents the out - of - plane component of the magnetic field .",
    "in agreement with the mhd solution @xcite , poloidal field lines in this plane become purely radial beyond @xmath23 .",
    "the y - point is located approximately at the light cylinder , and the current sheet oscillates around the equatorial plane . as shown in fig .",
    "1a , b , our kinetic solution has high multiplicity ( @xmath24 ) in the bulk of the polar outflow , which carries sub - gj current ( see fig .",
    ". the regions with current above the gj value , favorable for efficient pair formation , are the current sheet and the rims of the polar cap , where volume return current flows .",
    "the field structure is quasi - stable in the corotating frame .",
    "we note that within the simulation box the role of drift - kink instability of the current sheet , pointed out for the aligned rotator by ps14 and studied by @xcite , decreases with increasing obliquity , becoming negligible already for @xmath25 .",
    "this is a consequence of the decrease of conduction current in the current sheet with increasing obliquity .",
    "we ran simulations for obliquities @xmath26 , @xmath25 and @xmath27 , measuring the poynting flux integrated over a sphere with @xmath28 . combining with the aligned case ( ps14 ) ,",
    "we conclude that the spin - down energy loss of the pic solution is consistent with mhd studies : @xmath29 with coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( see figure 5 ) , and @xmath32 the inclination angle .",
    "[ fig3:60 ]     [ fig4:90 ]     in order to mimic the surface charge injection , we inject neutral plasma everywhere on the star with a rate of @xmath33 per time step , where @xmath34 is the local surface charge , @xmath35 is the injection point at the stellar surface , and @xmath36 is the @xmath37-component of the corotation electric field .",
    "we found that , in general , @xmath38 is not effectively screened at the surface for lower injection rates , while larger rates lead to virtual cathode oscillations . even though we inject neutral plasma , the particles",
    "are injected at rest , and one sign of charge is pulled into the star , while the other is accelerated into the magnetosphere .    in real pulsars , the particles that are accelerated above the polar cap emit high - energy curvature photons that produce pairs via magnetic conversion .",
    "the pairs are created in non - zero landau levels and emit synchrotron radiation that might also be converted into pairs .",
    "in addition to magnetic conversion of photons , the electron - positron pairs may be produced in @xmath39 collisions . in this study",
    "we ignore the mean free path of photons and produce secondary pairs at the location of primary energetic particles , whenever the energy of a particle exceeds the threshold @xmath40 .",
    "the threshold value is set to @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the full vacuum potential drop between the pole and the equator , @xmath43 .",
    "the threshold does not depend on the distance from the star .",
    "the rate of pair creation per particle in our simulation is @xmath44 per time step .",
    "these simulation parameters help ensure sufficient pair supply in the regions of magnetosphere where pair production is possible . in reality ,",
    "in addition to particle energy , the threshold and pair yield of both the magnetic conversion and @xmath39 collisions depend on the strength and curvature of the local magnetic field .",
    "our aim is not to model the true multiplicity of the flow , but to identify the regions of active pair formation that can yield high multiplicity . by using a pair production prescription that does not depend on the local magnetic field ,",
    "we obtain an upper limit on the number of such active regions . in order to resolve the skin depth and minimize computational cost",
    ", we put a limiter on the number of produced pairs , so that multiplicity in every cell where pairs are produced does not exceed @xmath45 .",
    "the secondary pairs are injected in the direction of primary particle motion , and are randomly distributed in the computational cell of the parent .",
    "their lorentz factor is set to @xmath46 , much less than that of the parent particle .",
    "we subtract the energy of produced pairs from the energy of the parent particle , accounting for the effect of radiation reaction force .",
    "[ fig5:loss ]   as a function of the inclination angle ( red triangles ) , measured at the stellar surface .",
    "the error bars correspond to the dissipated fraction of the poynting flux within @xmath47 .",
    "blue points show the results of pic simulations with abundant pair formation (  [ sec : test ] ) , and the blue curve shows prediction of the mhd model.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=52.0% ]    the magnetosphere of the aligned rotator with self - consistent pair formation is shown in fig .  2c .",
    "its magnetic field structure is close to the force - free solution : field becomes mostly toroidal beyond @xmath23 , and poloidal field lines stretch and become radial .",
    "the opposite polarities of toroidal field are supported by the equatorial current sheet .",
    "we observe moderate kinking of the sheet beyond @xmath47 , that does not affect the y - point region during our simulation .",
    "the polar region is inactive to pair formation , as pointed out by @xcite and cb14 .",
    "this happens because the current flow is sub - gj ( see figure 2d ) , thus @xmath38 within the light cylinder is easily screened by sub - relativistic electron outflow shown in figure 2a .",
    "however , pair production does take place in the return current layer and in the current sheet , which have high multiplicity of secondary pairs as shown in fig .",
    "the acceleration of parent particles occurs due to strong @xmath38 in the current sheet .",
    "the electric field points away from the star , and positrons are accelerated outwards , while high - energy electrons stream towards the star .",
    "these electrons pass through the y - point and penetrate into the inner magnetosphere by a few larmor radii .",
    "the current sheet width scales with magnetic field strength at the light cylinder , staying of the order of average larmor radius of particles .",
    "most of the open field lines do not cross the null surface , and the electron outflow on these lines extends to infinity .",
    "the last open field lines , however , go through the null surface .",
    "since the electron outflow can not cross the null surface , a vacuum gap opens above the current sheet ( cf .",
    "the spin - down of this solution , measured as the flux of electromagnetic energy at the stellar surface , is @xmath48 .",
    "we note that confining pair creation to inner magnetosphere , @xmath49 , or increasing the global pair creation threshold to values comparable with @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the magnetization parameter at the light cylinder , leads to the suppression of return current , and the magnetosphere relaxes to the low multiplicity solution ( @xcite ; cb14 ) . in this state",
    "the magnetosphere consists of an equatorial disk of positrons and a polar dome of electrons .",
    "positrons are pulled from the tip of the disk by strong electric field , @xmath52 ; however , the resulting current is not large enough to substantially modify the dipolar magnetic field structure .",
    "we found that magnetospheres of rotators with inclination angles @xmath53 are qualitatively similar to the aligned solution , showing no pair creation activity in the polar cap outflow .",
    "the bulk outflow in these solutions is charge - separated , and pair production happens only in the current sheet and the return layer .",
    "these solutions relax to the oblique disk - dome structure if the pair production in the outer magnetosphere is suppressed .",
    "this happens because the return current layer , where pair production is possible , can not be formed by particles lifted from the surface , since the sign of the necessary current is opposite to the sign of available charges .",
    "as there is no current outflow , the oblique disk - dome solutions spin down at the vacuum rate .    solutions with high obliquities , @xmath54 , do show pair creation in the polar cap zone .",
    "there are regions on the polar cap with volume return current exceeding the gj value @xcite .",
    "the structure of the @xmath25 rotator is shown in figure 3c .",
    "the magnetospheric structure is similar to what we found in  [ sec : test ] , with closed and open zones , y - point and the current sheet .",
    "pairs are produced in the region of volume return current and in the current sheet .",
    "the flow in the sheet is supported not only by the local pair creation , as in the case of the aligned rotator , but also by the reconnection - induced inflow of charges produced in the polar cap discharge .",
    "the plasma density is not uniform in the polar cap as seen from figures 3a and b. part of the polar cap supports charge - separated electron outflow with @xmath55 .",
    "the lorentz factor of this flow is @xmath56 , independent of the surface magnetic field .",
    "this is consistent with the estimate @xmath57 for the space - charge - limited flow ( @xcite ) in the case of sub - gj current .",
    "the volume return current region shows active pair production .",
    "the polar discharge has quasi - periodic behavior on the timescales short compared to the pulsar rotation period , with episodes of efficient pair production followed by quiet states .",
    "the three - dimensional study of the cascade intermittency is important for modelling the pulsar radio emission and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the multiplicity of the flow in the active region of the polar cap is @xmath24 , close to the limiting value .",
    "we performed a simulation with twice larger limiting value and observed that the multiplicity of the flow increases by roughly the same factor .",
    "though not the whole polar cap shows active pair formation , on average the pulsar wind is supplied with plasma of high multiplicity , concentrated in the equatorial current sheet wedge . the current sheet beyond the light cylinder",
    "should thus be the main source of @xmath58-photons , and the polar cap discharge is a candidate for the `` bridge '' emission . as in the aligned case ,",
    "mainly positrons are accelerated in the current sheet of the @xmath25 rotator .",
    "we find that current sheet of the pair forming solution shows more efficient kinking than the test solution from  [ sec : pulsar ] , though it does not strongly affect the global magnetospheric structure .",
    "we find that the volume return current region in our simulations is bounded by the null surface that crosses the polar cap ; this current is carried by positrons .",
    "however , in the limit of very small star @xmath59 the null surface is located outside the polar cap for inclinations that are not too close to @xmath27 , and the outflowing current is supposed to be carried only by electrons .",
    "thus , the pair - producing region with @xmath60 may disappear in the bulk region for the small stellar radius may also change . ] .",
    "we conclude that precise obliquity angle for transition between active and inactive state of the polar cap may change for @xmath61 .",
    "although our present simulations are already physically relevant for millisecond pulsars with high @xmath62 , we will investigate the smaller values of @xmath62 in future work .",
    "the @xmath27 rotator shows efficient pair production in the whole polar cap ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "in contrast to the aligned rotator , the current flow on the polar cap is anti - symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane .",
    "current density exceeds @xmath63 , necessitating the presence of @xmath7 discharge .",
    "pair formation also happens in the current sheet .",
    "moderate kinking of the sheet is observed close to the equatorial plane .",
    "in figure 5 we present the spin - down of our oblique solutions with pair formation , measured at the stellar surface . in our solution for the aligned rotator with pair discharges approximately 20% of the poynting flux",
    "is dissipated within @xmath47 .",
    "the dissipated fraction of total energy losses decreases for larger inclination angles and reaches 3% for the orthogonal rotator .",
    "the dissipated energy is converted into particle energy in acceleration regions .",
    "the deviation of spin - down from solutions with abundant pair formation discussed in  3 is small and becomes negligible with increasing inclination .",
    "the origin of this deviation is due to the presence of vacuum - like regions inside the light cylinder that are not in corotation with the star .",
    "in this letter we presented the magnetospheric structure of oblique pulsars with pair formation .",
    "we found that pulsars with low obliquities produce active solutions only if pair formation in the outer magnetosphere is working . in these solutions the pairs are produced in the equatorial current sheet beyond the light cylinder and in the return current layer .",
    "if the radio emission is produced in the high multiplicity flow at the polar cap , these pulsars should have mainly double - peaked profiles associated with return current layers . pulsars with obliquity angles @xmath64 show significant pair production activity in the polar regions .",
    "their radio beams may have multi - peaked structure .",
    "the spin - down of pair solutions is close to mhd model predictions .",
    "our prescription for pair formation is highly idealized . for simplicity we neglected the mean free path of photons and assumed the pair formation threshold to be independent of the local conditions . while this approximation is reliable for the polar cap discharge , the @xmath39 process which can account for the activity in the current sheet is intrinsically non - local , which requires more careful treatment .",
    "two processes may contribute to launching the @xmath7 discharge in the current sheet : collisions of energetic synchrotron photons emitted by counter - streaming particle flows , and collisions of thermal x - ray photons from the neutron star surface , which may be up - scattered by energetic particles in the sheet , with synchrotron photons .",
    "both mechanisms should operate most efficiently close to the y - point , where magnetic field in the sheet is strongest , and the emitted synchrotron photons are the most energetic .",
    "we assumed efficient pair formation in the current sheet , which may not happen in pulsars with low magnetic field strength at the light cylinder . in low obliquity pulsars with no pair formation in the current sheet ,",
    "the return current layer is suppressed , and such pulsars should not shine in the radio band , unless some physics beyond our model can reestablish pair formation .    a potentially important complication may arise due to the restricted ability of ions to produce pairs . though ions can still emit curvature photons capable of producing pairs in @xmath39 collisions with stellar photons , the resulting multiplicity of the flow due to this process is uncertain .",
    "this may affect the multiplicity of the polar outflow in the orthogonal rotator , where ions are extracted in the half of the polar cap .",
    "the poloidal field at the stellar surface may be more complicated than the pure dipole field considered in this work due to the operation of hall effect in the crust ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting multipolar field can modify the operation of the polar discharge , producing more regions with efficient pair production .    the value of @xmath65 that is essential for operation of polar discharge may be sensitive to general relativistic corrections .",
    "in particular , the value of gj charge density is reduced due to lense-thirring effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "the increased value of @xmath66 may lead to the ignition of polar discharge in low obliquity pulsars .",
    "this will be investigated in future work .",
    "we thank jonathan arons , vasily beskin , alexander tchekhovskoy , and andrey timokhin for fruitful discussions .",
    "this research was supported by nasa grants nnx12ad01 g and nnx13ao80 g , simons foundation ( grant 267233 to as ) , and was facilitated by max planck / princeton center for plasma physics .",
