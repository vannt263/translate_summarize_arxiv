    "we learn calculus in secondary school : first , differentiation of functions , and later integration as the inverse or opposite of differentiation  the integral is the anti - derivative or primitive function , from which _ definite integrals _ can be easily deduced .    in more advanced mathematics courses we learn riemann s definition of definite integrals which enables us to integrate more functions .",
    "the riemann method does not make use of differentiation ; it is similar to the ancient method of finding areas and volumes `` by exhaustion''that is , estimating the area or volume by dividing it up into pieces which are more easily estimated , and then taking the aggregate of the pieces .",
    "specialists in mathematical analysis go on from this to study the lebesgue method of integration .",
    "again , one of the stock answers to this question is that the lebesgue method enables us to integrate functions which can not be integrated by more familiar methods such as the calculus integral and the riemann integral .    the dirichlet function is sometimes mentioned . in the unit interval",
    "@xmath0 $ ] this function takes value one at the rational points , and zero at the other points .",
    "the dirichlet function is not the derivative of some other function , so it can not be integrated by the method we learn at school in calculus lessons .",
    "also , it can not be integrated by riemann s method .",
    "but the lebesgue integral of the dirichlet function exists : the definite integral of the dirichlet function on the unit interval is @xmath1 .",
    "apart from some specialists and experts , is there anybody else who has any real use for the dirichlet function , and who really cares whether or not it is amenable to calculus ? it can not be pictured as lines in a graph , it does not have a straightforward formulation in polynomial , trigonometric or exponential terms .",
    "unlike the area and volume calculations of antiquity , and unlike the calculus of newton and leibnitz which explained the world in mechanical terms , what difference does the dirichlet function make to anyone outside the narrow and rarified world of a tiny number of people in pure mathematics ?",
    "the same can be said of many of the other arcane and exotic functions , such as the devil s staircase , invented during the long nineteenth century gestation of lebesgue integration , measure theory and set theory .",
    "such functions have counter - intuitive and challenging qualities that we can admire and wonder at .",
    "but they were described by hermite and poincar as unwelcome monsters causing mayhem in the rich and fertile garden of mathematics .",
    "_ `` does anyone believe that the difference between the lebesgue and the riemann integrals can have physical significance , and that whether , say , an airplane would or would not fly could depend on this difference ?",
    "if such were claimed , i should not care to fly in that plane . '' _",
    "( richard w.  hamming @xcite ) .",
    "this critique is understandable , but unhistorical . by the early nineteenth century , the rich and fertile garden was on the verge of becoming a barren and dangerous wilderness  and not because of trespassing monster - functions .",
    "in the tradition of newton and leibnitz , fourier series representation of functions had opened up the analysis of wave motion , crucial to an understanding of sound , light , electricity and so on . but strange and paradoxical things could happen when the integral of a function was obtained by integrating its fourier series term by term .",
    "certain questions could no longer be avoided .",
    "to what extent , and under what conditions , is a function identical to its corresponding fourier series representation ? when is the integral of a function equal to the series obtained by integrating the terms of the corresponding fourier series ?",
    "this boils down to whether a convergent series of integrable functions has integrable limit , and whether the integral of the limit is equal to the limit of the integrals whenever the latter limit exists .",
    "such issues motivated decades of investigation of the notion of integration , until a satisfactory resolution was found in the convergence theorems  uniform , monotone , and dominated convergence  of lesbesgue integration theory . in particular the dominated convergence theorem tells us that if a sequence of integrable functions @xmath2 converges to @xmath3 , and if the sequence satisfies @xmath4 for all @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is integrable , then @xmath3 is integrable and @xmath7 converges to @xmath8 as @xmath9 .",
    "the integral here is the definite lebesgue integral on some domain .",
    "but the theorem holds for functions which are integrable in the older and more familiar senses of riemann , cauchy , and newton / leibnitz , since , broadly speaking , functions which are integrable in the latter senses are , _ a fortiori _ , integrable in the lebesgue sense .    from this point",
    "onwards somebody  not necessarily expert in lebesgue s integration  who is contentedly doing some familiar integral operations , and who encounters some issue of convergence such as term - wise integration of a fourier series , can proceed in safety if a dominant integrable function @xmath6 can be found for the convergence .",
    "this is the practical significance of lebesgue s theory .",
    "it is a reason why `` it is safe to fly in airplanes '' , so to speak .",
    "it is why the fertile garden did not turn into a barren wilderness . and",
    "the `` monster - functions '' were in reality guard dogs that played their part in protecting the garden .",
    "but is this the end of the story ?",
    "did lebesgue s 1901 and 1902 papers @xcite give the last word on the subject ?    here is a sequence of non - monstrous functions formed by combining some familiar polynomial with trigonometric functions . for @xmath10 ,",
    "let @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 if @xmath14 and @xmath12 @xmath1 if @xmath15 .",
    "an impression of function @xmath2 can be obtained from figure 3 below , which contains the graph of @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "figure 2 resembles figure 3 in the neighbourhood of @xmath18 .",
    "the difference between the two is @xmath19 , whose graph is in figure 1 .",
    "but the values of the latter function are very small in the neighbourhood of @xmath18 .",
    "figure 1 demonstrates its `` visual insignificance '' , so to speak .",
    "note that the vertical scale of figure 1 is much more magnified than the vertical scales of figures 2 and 3 .",
    "figure 4 is the graph of the primitive function or anti - derivative of @xmath3 , which will play a big part in our discussion .",
    "each @xmath2 has a single discontinuity ( at @xmath20 ) , but is differentiable at every other point .",
    "each @xmath2 is integrable ( in the sense of riemann and lebesgue ) , and the sequence @xmath2 is convergent at each @xmath21 to @xmath22 , @xmath23 , whose graph is figure 3 .",
    "the limit function @xmath3 has a single discontinuity ( from the right ) at @xmath18 ; and it has a primitive function @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 ( figure 4 ) ; so in fact @xmath3 has a definite integral @xmath27 on the domain @xmath0 $ ] * provided * the newton - leibnitz definition of the integral is used .",
    "but @xmath3 is unbounded on @xmath0 $ ] and therefore is not riemann integrable on @xmath0 $ ] . and ,",
    "though clearly non - monstrous , and understandable to a beginning calculus student , the function @xmath3 is * not * lebesgue integrable .",
    "see below for discussion of this point .    on the face of it ,",
    "this example indicates a step backwards , as it were , where the old school method of newton / leibnitz is actually more effective than more modern methods .",
    "lebesgue s theory of the integral threw up anomalies of this kind , and accordingly investigation of the theory continued through the twentieth century .    to recapitulate , lebesgue s dominated convergence theorem can be said to be the cutting edge of modern integration theory .",
    "but it fails to capture the convergence of sequences such as @xmath2 and @xmath28 .",
    "the graph in figure 3 suggests @xmath29 as a conceivable candidate for dominating function @xmath6 for the terms @xmath30 , @xmath31 , at least in a neighbourhood of the critical point @xmath18 .",
    "but @xmath29 is not integrable in a neighbourhood of @xmath1 , and it seems that the dominated convergence theorem is not applicable here .",
    "this failure must sound some alarm bells , because while many working mathematicians can get by without the lebesgue integral , we can not really do without convergence theorems which allow us , for instance , to perform routine operations on fourier series ; or , more generally , to safely find the integral of the limit of a sequence of integrable functions by taking the limit of the corresponding sequence of integrals .",
    "the purpose of this essay is to dip into some aspects of modern integration theory in order to introduce theorems [ crit1 ] , [ crit2 ] , and [ crit3 ] below , which are delicate enough to deal with , for instance , the convergence of the functions @xmath2 above and their integrals ; while also covering the ground already captured by the convergence theorems of lebesgue s theory .    for ease of reference , here",
    "again are the sequence @xmath2 and related functions , @xmath31 :    @xmath32    figures 3 and 4 are , respectively , the graphs of the functions @xmath3 and @xmath33 . the graphs of @xmath2 and @xmath34 are easily substituted  just insert a horizontal line segment at height @xmath1 from @xmath18 to @xmath35 .",
    "the function @xmath3 has a single discontinuity at @xmath18 , while @xmath33 is continuous .",
    "the reader should verify that @xmath33 is differentiable , including at the point @xmath18 ( from the right ) , and that @xmath36 .",
    "the fact that @xmath37 for @xmath25 is easily verified .",
    "this establishes that @xmath3 , @xmath38 , has a primitive or anti - derivative , and @xmath33 is the calculus- or newton - indefinite integral of @xmath3 .",
    "also the calculus- or newton - definite integral on @xmath0 $ ] is @xmath39 for each @xmath5 both @xmath2 and @xmath34 have a discontinuity at @xmath40 , but provided @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 .",

    "in fact we will establish later that ( [ convergence example ] ) is valid for an adapted version of the riemann integral ; and that the convergence  including integrability of the limit function @xmath3though unrelated to any kind of dominated convergence , satisfies a new kind of riemann sum convergence criterion which goes beyond the lebesgue dominated convergence theorem .    ]    ]    ]    ]    to recapitulate , for @xmath47 the function @xmath2 is bounded and continuous  except for a discontinuity at @xmath48 .",
    "also it is differentiable except at @xmath48 .",

    ", even though each @xmath2 is lebesgue integrable , the limit function @xmath3 is not lebesgue integrable  as demonstrated below .    is this a big problem for the garden of mathematics , or is it just a minor incursion by , not a monster , but an atypical creature which",

    "henstock was interested in convergence issues in integration .",
    "independently , each of them focussed on careful construction of riemann sums for integrands @xmath3 .",

    "clearly , every riemann integrable function is also integrable in the riemann - complete sense .",
    "a stieltjes - type definition of the integral of a function @xmath3 can be expressed as follows .",

    "every lebesgue integrable function is integrable in the riemann - complete sense ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a key point is that the lebesgue integral is an absolute integral , while the riemann - complete is non - absolute . writing @xmath117 if @xmath118 , with @xmath119 otherwise , and @xmath120 , absolute integrability implies that @xmath3 is lebesgue integrable if and only if both @xmath121 and @xmath122 are lebesgue integrable . , which does * not * require the riemann - complete integrability of @xmath121 and @xmath122 . ]",
    "we use this point to demonstrate that the function @xmath3 defined by ( [ f ] ) is not lebesgue integrable .    with that in mind ,",
    "figure 3 provides an indication of how the function @xmath3 defined by ( [ f ] )    * fails to be lebesgue integrable , while * its riemann - complete integral exists .",
    "in fact figure 3 shows that , in neighbourhoods of @xmath18 , the graph of @xmath3 oscillates increasingly rapidly , in positive ( @xmath121 , above the @xmath21-axis ) loops and negative ( @xmath122 , below the @xmath21-axis ) loops whose amplitude ( or height / depth ) increases without limit as @xmath123 .",
    "this creates the suspicion , or expectation , that the sum of areas of the positive loops diverges to @xmath124 , while the sum of areas of the negative loops diverges to @xmath125 .",
    "but if , instead of treating positive and negative loops separately , we add up their areas in their natural sequence , then positive and negative areas will tend to cancel each other out , and the resulting sequence of net values may converge . , the series @xmath126 converges , but the series consisting of only the positive terms ( or only negative terms ) diverges ; so @xmath127 diverges . ]",
    "the latter is what happens in the riemann sum construction of the riemann - complete integral of @xmath3 .",
    "the following discussion seeks to add substance to these speculations . in any interval ,",
    "not including zero , but with small values of @xmath21 , figure 1 shows that the contribution from the term @xmath128 to the area under the graph of @xmath3 is vanishingly small in neighbourhoods of @xmath18 , while the corresponding contribution from the term @xmath129 in @xmath3 is relatively large . therefore , disregarding the term @xmath128 , the zeros of ( [ f ] ) can , for present purposes , be estimated approximately as @xmath130 accordingly we may estimate that , for large , even values of @xmath131 , @xmath132 while for large and odd values of @xmath131 @xmath133 writing @xmath134 each of the two series @xmath135 diverges , so it is clear that @xmath3 is not lebesgue integrable in @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "but it is easy to see that the series @xmath136 is non - absolutely convergent , even if we did not already know , from existence of the primitive function @xmath93 for @xmath94 , that @xmath3 is riemann - complete integrable .",
    "this is because the riemann - complete convergence is obtained from the cancellation effects produced by successively summing the positive and negative parts in their natural sequence .",
    "we can ensure this by choosing @xmath137 as follows .",
    "when @xmath21 lies between adjacent roots @xmath138 and @xmath139 let @xmath140 and if @xmath141 is one of the roots @xmath138 , take @xmath142 and when @xmath18 let @xmath143 be arbitrary .",
    "any partition corresponding to this definition of @xmath137 ( @xmath94 ) will contain a term with @xmath144 , and the terms for non - zero @xmath21 will each contain an arbitrarily close estimate of the area of the corresponding positive or negative loop in figure 3 .",
    "this provides the required cancellation and convergence of riemann sums , since the alternating loops are monotone decreasing in area as @xmath21 approaches @xmath1 .    in the case of the lebesgue integral",
    "this cancellation effect is absent , and convergence fails .",
    "this establishes that , just as there are lebesgue integrable functions that are not riemann integrable , there are riemann - complete integrable functions that are not lebesgue integrable .",
    "anybody experienced in the theory of integration will be aware that most of the preceding discussion covers fairly well - worn ground which has already been worked through in many excellent publications , such as @xcite .",
    "but at the outset of this article it was stated that , while lebesgue s dominated convergence theorem is a crucial pillar of modern analysis , there are certain areas of the subject where this theorem is deficient .",
    "the sequence @xmath145 of ( [ fj ] ) demonstrates that the dominated convergence theorem provides no illumination in this particular instance of converging non - absolute integrals .",

    "instead we have various statements about riemann sums .    however , setting aside for a moment the conception of integral as primitive function , or anti - derivative , the original and more durable meaning of integral involves slicing up ( partitioning ) , followed by summation , followed by taking a limit of the sums .    from this perspective , it may be less of a surprise that riemann sums appear in the formulation of conditions for limits of integrals , since riemann sums are central to the concept of integral .",

    "after all , riemann sums are fine for defining the meaning of the integral of a function .",

    "remember , for each @xmath5 the function @xmath2 is riemann integrable and lebesgue integrable , but not newton / leibnitz integrable , and their limit function @xmath3 is newton / leibnitz integrable but not riemann or lebesgue integrable .",

    "this discussion of the convergence criteria of theorems [ crit1 ] , [ crit2 ] and [ crit3 ] is set in the context of riemann - complete integrability .",
    "the subject of the first criterion is the ( riemann - complete ) integrability of the limit function @xmath3 , and it is established by examining riemann sums of the form @xmath175 we already know , by various means , including a direct investigation of the riemann sums @xmath166 , that @xmath58 is ( riemann - complete ) integrable on @xmath0 $ ] .",

    "this is the essence of theorem [ crit1 ] . and",
    "according to theorem [ crit1 ] the answer to this question should be yes . given @xmath66 , and with a suitable gauge @xmath137 , provided factors @xmath179 are chosen appropriately we should be able to demonstrate that the value of each corresponding riemann sum @xmath176 will lie within some ball @xmath180 of radius @xmath149 where @xmath149 is arbitrarily small .",
    "since we are already convinced of the integrability of @xmath3 in this case , what we are really trying to do here is to get a sense of the behaviour of sums @xmath176 .",
    "so , given the integrability of @xmath3 , write @xmath1810,1 ] } f(x)dx$ ] and choose a gauge @xmath84 so that , for every @xmath84-fine partition @xmath68 of @xmath1730,1]$ ] , @xmath182 the ball with centre @xmath147 and radius @xmath149 .",

    "the convenient equation @xmath190 can not be appealed to .",
    "but if , with suitable choices of @xmath177 , the differences @xmath191 can make sufficiently small contributions to the riemann sum , then it may be plausible that @xmath192 so @xmath3 is integrable .",
    "this is the intuitive content of theorem [ crit1 ] .    now",
    "to theorem [ crit2 ] .",
    "the preceding remarks are concerned with the integrability of @xmath193 .",
    "the fundamental assumption is that each function @xmath2 in the sequence @xmath145 is integrable . in the case of our example ( [ fj ] )",

    "note that continuity of @xmath33 implies @xmath197 as @xmath9 . in this case",

    "f_j(x ) dx$ ] converges as @xmath199 , the limit being ( in this case ) @xmath200 ; what we want is confirmation , including intuitive confirmation , that theorem [ crit2 ] actually works .",
    "the convergence of a sequence of integrals is the subject of theorem [ crit2 ] , and it is again expressed in terms of riemann sums .",
    "the criterion implies that , with arbitrarily small @xmath66 given , there is a ball @xmath201 with centre @xmath156 and radius @xmath149 , and a corresponding integer @xmath202 depending only on @xmath149 , so that for each @xmath203 , a gauge @xmath204 can be found such that for every @xmath205-fine partition of @xmath0 $ ] the corresponding riemann sum @xmath206 is contained in @xmath201 ; so for every @xmath205-fine @xmath68 , @xmath207 whenever @xmath208 . unlike theorem [ crit1 ] , here @xmath5 is the same for each term of any particular riemann sum .",

    "this agrees with the criterion of theorem [ crit3 ] , which requires that @xmath147 and @xmath156 have the same value . in this case",
    "@xmath218 so the intuitive content of theorem [ crit3 ] is clear in the context of this example .",
    "so , does it really matter whether aviation designers work out their aerodynamic equations using old - fashioned riemann integrals or the latest fancy lebesgue integrals ?    probably not much .",
    "but it matters a lot if the value 22/7 for @xmath219 were hard - wired into every computer in the world . or if the wrong value for elasticity of o - rings at freezing temperature was used in space shuttle design .",
    "and it certainly matters whether our aviation designers make tricky , unjustifiable calculations involving , for instance , term - by - term integration of fourier series .",
    "it is thanks to the intellectual diligence of the nineteenth century , not to mention its monster - functions , that we have the dominated convergence theorem to keep the garden of mathematics safe and fertile  and , indeed , to keep airplanes flying safely .    but do we really need anything more than the dominated convergence theorem for absolutely convergent integrals ? why bring up the convergence criteria of theorems [ crit1 ] , [ crit2 ] , and [ crit3 ] ?",
    "is the sequence @xmath145 described in ( [ fj ] ) above just an exceptional one - off , or is it representative of something more significant ? if the latter , where are all these non - absolute integrals ?",
