    "the nearby galaxy m33 ( @xmath8  kpc ; @xcite ) hosts the most luminous steady x - ray source in the local group .",
    "m33 x-8 dominates the x - ray emission from the galaxy with a 1 - 10  kev luminosity of about 1.2@xmath9  erg  s@xmath7 , ten times more than that of the other x - ray sources in the field .",
    "the ultra - luminous x - ray source ( ulx ) has been detected at this level since its discovery by _",
    "einstein_. @xcite .",
    "observations obtained with the _ rosat _ high resolution imager ( hri ) showed that x-8 is point - like and coincident with the optical nucleus of m33 at the hri 5 resolution @xcite .",
    "these also revealed a 106 day @xmath1020% modulation of the x - ray flux from m33 x-8 @xcite .",
    "the nature of the x - ray emitting object is rather puzzling .",
    "the measured velocity dispersion of the nucleus places an upper limit of 1500  m@xmath11 on the mass of a putative massive central black hole @xcite .",
    "a low luminosity active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is therefore unlikely .",
    "indeed , the uv / optical spectrum of the nucleus shows no signs of agn - type activity and is best modelled by a combination of two starbursts at 40 myrs and 1 gyrs ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the 106 day modulation suggests a single object is responsible for most of the x - ray emission , perhaps a persistent x - ray binary with a 10 m@xmath11 black hole radiating at the eddington luminosity .",

    "observations place a limit of 18% on the contribution of a point source to the total far - uv flux from the nucleus @xcite",
    ". the implied ratio @xmath12/@xmath13 would be in line with expectations from a low - mass x - ray binary .",
    "the counterpart would then be mostly lost in the glare of the nucleus .",
    "however , there remains a distinct possibility that m33 x-8 is associated with a uv bright star located 1 to the nnw @xcite .",
    "the star has a o9iii spectrum with no outstanding feature linking it to the powerful x - ray source but can not be ruled out at the _ rosat _ hri resolution @xcite .",
    "most studies have assumed m33 x-8 is associated with the nucleus and used this to register the x - ray images .",
    "_ chandra _ offers the opportunity to locate m33 x-8 to unprecedented accuracy and settle whether this source is within the nucleus or not .",
    "three observations of m33 are available in the _ chandra _ archive ( table  1 ) .",
    "we used the first two to accurately position m33 x-8 with respect to _ hst _ planetary camera ( pc ) images of the nucleus (  2 ) .",

    "the 1 - 2  precision of the _ chandra _ pipeline aspect solution is insufficient for our purposes . to improve on this , we identified x - ray sources within the field - of - view and cross - correlated these to optical , ir and radio sources with accurately known positions .",
    "m33 x-8 is severely affected by pile - up in the two 50  ks acis observations .",
    "the count rate in the acis - s observation is 0.5 counts / frame compared to 3.0 counts / frame in the 10  ks non piled - up 10  ks acis - s observation ( see  3 below ) . the pile - up fraction is therefore about 84% which makes it impossible to study the radial extension of the source to higher accuracy than the _ rosat _ hri .",
    "observations with the _ chandra _ hrc would be able resolve any contribution from extended emission or faint point sources within 5 .",

    "are very piled - up hence have a dearth of counts so that the 0.5 - 2  kev image is doughnut shaped ( standard g02346 events ) .",
    "going to higher energies reduces the effect and there is a very well defined peak in both acis - s and i.    celldetect ( ciao v2.2.0.1 ) locates m33 x-8 at ( 4098.1,4057.2)@xmath20.1  pixels in the acis - i and at ( 4063.0,4026.3)@xmath20.5  pixels in the acis - s . to check these values",

    "the values obtained by selecting only the events with energies above 1 , 2 or 5  kev are all consistent with the celldetect locations and errors which we therefore adopt .",
    "the optical position of the nucleus we adopt is the 2mass position which is tied to the tycho reference frame .",

    "there was an obvious concentration of matches around the offset between x-8 and the 2mass position of the nucleus ( table  2 and fig .  2 ) .",
    "note that some of the matches may refer to the same object such as the usno and tycho match for hp87 .",
    "none of the direct variable sources matched an x - ray source within 3 although we note that a star with a 3.4 days optical period ( d33j013334.8 + 303211.4 , @xcite ) lies within 10 of the 3.45 day eclipsing x - ray source x-7 @xcite .",

    "we conclude the radio associations are very likely to be true counterparts ( in contrast with the usno , 2mass and tycho associations for which the same calculation does not rule out chance superpositions ) .",
    "we now estimate the probability that the offsets given by the radio counterparts are consistent with the offset between the 2mass position of the nucleus and x-8 ( @xmath47 in fig .",

    "the acis - s result is less conclusive than the acis - i because of the higher uncertainty in the position of x-8 in the acis - s ( @xmath20.5 pixel compared to @xmath20.1 pixel , see  2.1 ) .",

    "hp84 is classified as a supersoft x - ray source by @xcite .",
    "we performed spectral analysis using data from the acis - s observation obsid 787 .",

    "the source was 7.7  off - axis , at which the the 50% enclosed energy function ( eef ) at 1.5 kev is 4  vs. 0.3on - axis , resulting in the source covering an area larger by a factor @xmath10170 , to 0.02 counts / frame / psf , at which the estimated pileup fraction should be negligible ( @xmath51% ) .",
    "we confirmed this by comparing the distribution of photon event grades ( for grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 ) below 2 kev and in the 2 - 8 kev range with those of a non - piled up x - ray observation ( of zw3146 , obsid 1651 , seq .",

    "an absorbed blackbody spectrum is also statistically rejected ( @xmath57 for 23 dof ) .",
    "we find a moderately acceptable fit ( @xmath58=1.35 ) for an absorbed thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum .",

    "a power - law component is not required by the data .",

    "we binned the 27259 counts detected in the full _ chandra _ pass band , with 1.04104 sec time resolution , and took a fourier transform of the data . with the resulting fourier components , we obtained a power - density spectrum ( pds ; see @xcite for the use of pds for broad - band timing analysis ) which we rebinned logarithmically .",

    "thus , we find no evidence for intensity variability on timescales between 1 and 10,000 sec .",
    "the high luminosity of m33 x-8 is not sufficient to rule out a neutron star x - ray binary since magnetospheric accretion can result in super - eddington luminosities .",

    "the spectrum is dominated by a disc blackbody with a weak contribution from a steep power law .",

    "grs  1915 + 105 has been known to show steady radio emission around 30 - 50  mjy at 2  cm , framed by powerful ejection episodes where the emission from the relativistic jets becomes @xmath73 500  mjy @xcite .",
    "the radio source in m33 is more powerful than that ; but a small change in the beaming angle of the jet ( @xmath74 from the line - of - sight for grs  1915 + 105 ) could easily increase the observed radio flux .",
