    "the scalar top quark , the bosonic partner of the top quark , has attracted much attention as it is expected to be the lightest colored supersymmetric ( susy ) @xcite particle . @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the supersymmetric partners of the left - handed and right - handed top quark , mix and the resulting two mass eigenstates @xmath0 and @xmath14 , can have a large mass splitting .",
    "it is even possible that the lighter eigenstate @xmath0 could be lighter than the top quark itself @xcite , @xcite .",
    "searches for top squarks were performed at lep and tevatron and will continue at lhc and ilc @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this note is the continuation of our previous note where we have considered stop pair production in photon - photon collisions @xcite . in the following",
    "we study the reaction @xmath15    among the possible @xmath0-decay channels within the mssm ( see @xcite for details ) , we focus on the decay @xmath3 followed by the two - body chargino decay @xmath16 , where one of the w s decays hadronically , @xmath17 , and the other one leptonically , @xmath18 with the subsequent decay @xmath19 was considered in @xcite @xcite . ]",
    ". the final state of this signal process , shown in the left diagram of fig.1 , contains two @xmath2- quarks , two quarks ( originating from the decay of one w boson ) , a hard muon plus a neutrino ( from the decay of the other w ) and two neutralinos : @xmath20 the main background process is top quark pair production with the subsequent decay @xmath21 ( for w s we use the same decay channels as in the stop case ) : @xmath22 the only difference between the final states of stop and top production ( shown in the right diagram of fig.1 ) is that in stop pair production there are two neutralinos which are undetectable .",
    "thus , both processes have the same signature : two @xmath2-jets , two jets from w decay and a muon . in the following",
    "we show that the physical variables constructed of jets combinations may allow to reconstruct the scalar top quark mass .",
    "in the present paper we consider only top pair production as background .",
    "cc +    -0.5 cm    we analyse the processes ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) with the help of monte carlo samples of the corresponding events generated by the two programs pythia6.4 @xcite and circe1 @xcite .",
    "the program circe1 is used for the parametrization of the beam spectra involved in the processes ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) to account for the effects of beamstrahlung .",
    "the energy of the beams is chosen as @xmath23 = 350 , 400 , 500 , 800 , 1000 gev .",
    "most plots are shown for @xmath24 = 500 gev and a stop mass @xmath25 gev .    in section 2",
    "we give the set of mssm parameters used in our study .    in section 3",
    "we discuss some general characteristics of the signal process @xmath26 and the main background @xmath27 .",
    "first we show how the beam energies are affected by beamstralung and other beam interaction effects which are simulated with circe1 .",
    "the subsections include kinematical distributions ( obtained without imposing of any cuts ) for the produced stop quarks , for the jets originating from w boson decay and for @xmath2-jets .",
    "we compare them in detail with those of top pair production .    in section 4",
    "we demonstrate how to discriminate between the signal muons produced in w boson decays and those stemming from hadron decays in the same events .    in section 5",
    "we show the distributions of the global variables missing energy , total visible energy , the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all visible particles in the event and the invariant masses of the final - state hadronic jets plus the signal muon .",
    "we show that they are good tools for separating the signal from the top background .",
    "in section 6 we introduce further two global variables , the invariant mass of the final - state hadronic jets and the missing mass and demonstrate that they are very useful for the separation of signal stop events from the background top events .",
    "we propose three cuts which provide a good signal - to - background ratio ( s / b ) .",
    "the impact of the proposed cuts on the values of the cross sections of stop and top pair productions are shown together with the values of s / b ratios for different values of @xmath6 .",
    "section 7 is devoted to the mass reconstruction of the scalar top quark based on the distribution of the invariant mass of one @xmath2-jet and the other two @xmath28-jets ( from w decay ) , provided that the neutralino mass is known .    in section 8",
    "we show the distributions of the invariant variables described in section 7 for a stop mass @xmath29 gev .",
    "section 9 contains some conclusions .",
    "the scalar top quark system is described by the mass matrix ( in the @xmath30 basis ) @xcite , @xcite @xmath31 with @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 the mass eigenvalues are given by @xmath35\\ ] ] with the mixing angle @xmath36 gev ;  @xmath37 gev ;  @xmath38 gev ( stop trilinear coupling ) ;     @xmath39 ;   @xmath40 gev ;   @xmath41 gev ;   @xmath42 gev .",
    "+ note that in pythia6.4 @xmath43 corresponds to @xmath44 ( left squark mass for the third generation ) and @xmath45 corresponds to @xmath46 .",
    "these parameters give @xmath25 gev , @xmath47 gev and @xmath48 gev .",
    "this parameter point is compatible with all experimental data .",
    "we have chosen this value of @xmath49 rather close to the mass of the top quark @xmath50 gev @xcite .",
    "this means that one expects a rather large contribution from the top background , therefore , this choice makes the analysis most difficult . finding a suitable set of cuts separating stop and top events is crucial .    in general , the cross section for stop pair production at a fixed energy depends on the mass of the stop quark and the mixing angle @xmath51 .",
    "since the couplings of the @xmath52 to the left and right components of the stop are different , the cross sections depend significantly on the beam polarizations ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . by choosing appropriate longitudinal beam polarizations",
    "it is possible to enhance the cross sections .",
    "for example , for an electron beam with 90@xmath53 left polarization the cross section would be larger than the unpolarized cross section by approximately 40@xmath53 , for cos @xmath51 = - 0.81 corresponding to the parameters given above .",
    "if in addition the positron beam has 60@xmath53 right polarization , then the cross section is enhanced by approximately a factor of 2 compared to the unpolarized cross section .",
    "we note that a rather precise determination of the stop mixing angle @xmath51 is possible by measuring the left - right asymmetry .",
    "the cross section for top pair production has also a characteristic dependence on the beam polarizations @xcite .",
    "for example , the polarization of both beams leads to an increase of the cross section by about a factor of 1.5 .",
    "in the following we present some distributions of different physical variables based on the sample of @xmath54 stop pair production events generated by pythia6.4 and circe1 weighted with the electron - positron luminosity .",
    "analogous plots are also given for @xmath55 generated background top events . in this section all plots are obtained without any cuts .",
    "the ilc is a linear electron - positron collider with a center - of - mass energy of 200 - 500 gev and a high luminosity ( peak luminosity of @xmath56 ) , upgraded to 1  tev in the second phase . according to @xcite a total luminosity of 500 fb@xmath57",

    "fig.3 shows two kinematical distributions characteristic of the produced stop pair system , i.e. , the number of expected events versus the stop transverse momentum @xmath63 ( plot * a ) * ) and its polar angle @xmath64 ( see plot * b ) * ( all in the @xmath1 c.m.s . ) . as can be seen in fig.3 * a ) * the stop transverse momentum @xmath63 spectrum begins at @xmath65 gev and has a peak near the kinematical limit .",
    "cm    in fig.3 and the following figures the vertical axis shows the number of stop and top events that may be expected for the integrated luminosity l@xmath66 1000 @xmath5 . taking the integral of the distributions one can get the total number of events expected for this luminosity .",
    "these numbers are shown as `` integral '' values in the figures .    to find the jets we use the subroutine pyclus of pythia with the distance measure utilized in the `` durham algorithm '' .",
    "the parameters of this jet finder , which is widely used in @xmath67 physics , are chosen such that the number of jets is @xmath68 four ( see also @xcite ) .       according to the decay chain ( 2 ) ,",

    "it is also seen ( plot * a ) * of fig.4 ) that the peak position of `` @xmath71-quark '' energy distribution ( @xmath78 gev ) is shifted to the left by about 17 gev ( @xmath79 gev ) when passing to the jet level ( see plot * a ) * of fig.6 ) .",

    "hence , in the stop case the invariant mass of two quarks produced in the decay of the virtual @xmath77 is smaller than the mass of a real w boson . in top production",

    "the corresponding spectrum in top production is much harder and its main part is concentrated within the interval @xmath94 gev .",
    "the mean values of the b - quark energies are about 11 gev and 94 gev in stop and top production , respectively .",
    "this means that in the stop case ( see plot * a ) * ) the b - quark takes a smaller part of the stop energy @xmath95 gev than the b - quark gets in the background top case ( see plot * b ) * ) .",

    "the shape of the @xmath96 spectrum of @xmath2-quarks in the stop case ( see plot * a ) * in fig.11 ) is similar to the shape of the @xmath97 spectrum ( see plot * a ) * in fig.10 ) .",

    "most of the top events have @xmath98 gev and @xmath99 gev . the difference to stop decay",
    "is easily understandable .",
    "the stop decays into a heavy chargino , whereas the top decays into a real w boson whose mass is only half of the mass of the chargino @xmath100",

    "plot * b ) * of fig.12 contains the @xmath102 distribution , where @xmath102 is the cosine of the opening angle between the 3-momenta of the @xmath2- and @xmath91-quarks produced in the same stop event .",
    "it demonstrates that most of the @xmath2- and @xmath91-quarks move in approximately opposite directions , but some are in the same hemisphere .",

    "the reason for this is that in the stop case the end points of the energy distributions for the @xmath2-jets and @xmath91-jets are higher than those for the corresponding quarks due to appearance of long tails at higher @xmath103 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that at the same time the position of the peak in @xmath2-jet energy distribution @xmath103 ( see plot * a ) * of fig.13 ) in the stop case is only slightly shifted to higher values ( by about 3 - 4 gev ) compared to the @xmath97 peak in plot * a ) * of fig 10 .",
    "also note that there are practically no changes of the peak positions of the quark level @xmath96 and the jet level @xmath104 distributions shown in plots * a ) * of figs.11 and 14 , respectively .",
    "thus we can say that the peak positions of energy and transverse momentum distributions turn out to be rather stable when passing from @xmath2-quark to @xmath2-jet level .",
    "now let us turn to the analogous energy and transverse momentum distributions obtained for the case of top background .",
    "as seen from comparison of the energy plots * b ) * of figs.10 and 13 , as well as the transverse momentum plots * b ) * of figs.11 and 14 , the mean values of the @xmath2-jet and @xmath91-jet energy and transverse momentum distributions are about 1 - 3 gev smaller than the mean values of the corresponding @xmath2-quark and @xmath91-quark distributions .",
    "let us summarize the results which were obtained in subsections 3.2 and 3.3 by the use of pyclus jet finder .",
    "first , it was found that in the case of top background production the characteristic parameters of energy and transverse momentum distributions of jets stemming from w decay and of @xmath2-jets , produced in @xmath2-quark hadronization , practically do not differ from the parameters of their parent quarks distributions .",
    "this picture changes quite noticeably when we consider the case of stop production with its further decay through the channel @xmath3 . in this case",
    "the @xmath2-quarks are much less energetic than the b - quarks produced in top decay @xmath21 .",
    "it was observed that the use of the same pyclus jet finder in the stop case leads to a noticeable redistribution of jet energies and , correspondingly , of their transverse momentum .",
    "namely , the mean values of jet energy @xmath76 and jet transverse momentum @xmath105 are about 15 - 17 gev smaller than the energy @xmath70 and transverse momentum @xmath72 of parent `` @xmath71-quarks '' ( stemming from w boson decay ) , while the mean values of @xmath2-jet energy @xmath103 and jet transverse momentum @xmath104 are by about 15 - 17 gev higher than the energy @xmath97 and @xmath96 of parent @xmath2-quarks .    in the following",
    "we shall return to this subject and consider the set of physical variables which shall take into account this effect of energy redistribution in a case of stop production .",

    "analogously , @xmath153 is the efficiency of the successive application of the cuts ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) .",
    "the following results are obtained : + for signal stop events :   @xmath154 ;   @xmath155 ;  @xmath156 ;    for background top events : @xmath157 ;   @xmath158 ;   @xmath159 .",
    "+       we give the cross sections and the numbers of events for stop pair production and top pair production for five energies @xmath24 in table 1 without cuts and table 2 with cuts . to calculate the rates of stop production at different energies we take the value of the integrated luminosity @xmath160 1000 @xmath5 for all energies .",
    "it is seen that the cuts ( 14)-(16 ) lead to a strong suppression ( more than 3 orders of magnitude ) of the background top contribution and a moderate loss of signal stop events produced in the energy range @xmath161 gev .    for the stop",

    "let us note that , according to @xcite , a @xmath162 efficiency of the separation of @xmath2 -jets and @xmath163 of the corresponding purity can be expected .",
    "it means that in reality to get 1806 signal stop events , reconstructed with an account of @xmath2- tagging , we will need about 2.5 times higher statistics than that provided by the integrated luminosity 1000 fb@xmath57 at @xmath58 gev .",
    "it is worth noting that , as seen from table 2 , even with the use of the fixed parameters of the cuts ( 14)(16 ) the number of signal stop events that can pass these cuts grows rapidly with the energy in the region @xmath164 gev where mass measurements will be done in the first phase .",
    "these measurements may allow to enlarge the sample of collected signal events and to perform a precise measurement of the stop mass .",
    "the region @xmath165 gev , which will be available in the second phase of ilc operation , allows to gain a much higher stop statistics , as seen in table 2 . a complete analysis based on adjusting the parameters of the selection cuts ( 15)-(16 ) for each of the above energies intervals",

    "more precisely , if the signal event contains a @xmath172 as the signal muon ( see fig.1 ) , we have to take the @xmath2-jet ( @xmath173-jet in the case of @xmath174 as the signal muon ) .",
    "this is only possible if one can discriminate between the @xmath2- and @xmath173-jets experimentally .",
    "methods of experimental determination of the charge of the @xmath2-jet ( @xmath173-jet ) were developed in @xcite . in the present paper",

    "these distributions have an important common feature .",
    "namely , they show that the peak positions at quark level and at jet level , practically coincide to a good accuracy with each other as well as with the input value of the top quark mass @xmath179 gev .",
    "it is also seen from plot * b ) * of fig.23 that the quark hadronization into jets leads to a broadening of very small tails which are seen in the invariant mass distribution at quark level ( plot * b ) * of fig.24 ) .",
    "the right tail , which appeared at jet level ( see plot * b ) * ) of fig.23 ) is a bit lower than the left tail and is longer than the left one .",
    "one may say that the peak shape at jet level still looks more or less symmetric .",
    "the main message from these plots is that the appearance of tails due to quark fragmentation into jets does not change the position of the distribution peak , which allows us to reconstruct the input top mass both at quark and jet level*s*.    an analogous stability of the peak position at the jet and quark levels for the stop case can be seen in the plots * a ) * of figs.23 and 24 .",
    "note that , according to the stop decay chain ( 2 ) , the right edge of the peak of the invariant mass distribution of the `` @xmath180 '' system ( see plot * a ) * of fig.24 ) corresponds to the mass difference @xmath181 .",
    "now let us recall that according to subsection 6.1 the application of the cuts ( 14)(16 ) leaves only 12 background top events and saves about 76@xmath53 of signal stop events .",
    "it means that the picture shown in plot * b ) * of fig.23 would change drastically and resemble a random distribution of the twelve top events in a rather wide interval . in the case of",
    "stop pair production the distributions of the invariant mass of the `` @xmath180 '' at quark level and of the system `` @xmath2-jet+@xmath182 '' at jet level system are shown in fig.25 taking only those stop events that have passed the cuts ( 14)(16 ) .",
    "cc +    -0.5 cm    it is seen that the peak position of the stop distribution at jet level @xmath183-jet , @xmath184 , obtained after application of the cuts ( 14)(16 ) ( plot * b ) * of fig.25 ) , coincides with the peak position at quark level ( plot * a ) * of fig.25 ) as well as with the peak positions in plots * a ) * of figs.23 and 24 obtained without any cuts .",
    "let us note that the observed stability of the peak position in both plots of fig.25 is due to the rather moderate loss of the number of events in the peak region ( they change from @xmath185 to @xmath186 ) while passing from quark level to jet level .",
    "the interval 150350 gev in the plot * b ) * of fig.25 can be used to calculate the width between the grid dots in this plot .",
    "it is found to be about 7.4 gev .",
    "this number allows to estimate the position of the right edge of the peak of @xmath183-jet , @xmath184 distribution , which seems to be shifted to the left side from 100 gev point by the distance which is a bit less than two dot intervals , i.e. , by a bit less than 14.8 gev .",
    "thus , we can estimate that the right edge of the @xmath183-jet , @xmath184 distribution peak lies a bit higher than 85.2 gev .",
    "some remarks about the tails in the stop distributions are in order now .",
    "the origin of the right and left tails of the distribution shown in the plot * a ) * of fig.25 can be clarified by the results of the stop mass reconstruction by calculating its invariant mass at quark level @xmath167(@xmath2 , @xmath187 as the modulus of the sum of the 4-momenta of all three quarks and the neutralino ( see fig.1 ) in stop decay .",
    "these results are given in plot * a ) * of fig.26 which shows a very precise reconstruction of the input stop mass at quark level withing the 5 gev width of the bin containing the peak .",
    "comparing plot * a ) * of fig.25 with plot * a ) * of fig.26 one can conclude that at quark level the long left tail as well as the very small right tail in the distribution of @xmath167(@xmath2 , @xmath188 disappear when neutralino 4-momentum is added to the 4-momentum of the `` @xmath180 '' system .",
    "cm    the influence of the effect of the hadronization of the @xmath2-quarks and of the quarks from w decay into jets is shown in plot * b ) * of fig.26 .",
    "this plot demonstrates that the hadronization of quarks into jets does not change the position of the stop mass peak , which practically coincides with the input value @xmath25 gev .",
    "it is also seen that the hadronization results in the appearance of more or less symmetrical and rather suppressed short tails around the peak position .",
    "the mean value of the distribution in plot * b ) * of fig.26 is also very slightly different from the mean value of the quark level distribution shown in plot * a ) * of fig.26 .",
    "both of these mean values are in a good agreement with the input value of the stop mass .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the shape of the peak in the stop plot * b ) * of fig.26 looks similar to the shape of the peak in the top plot * b ) * of fig.23 which also demonstrates the stability ( compaired to the quark level top plot * b ) * of fig.24 ) of the reconstructed top mass peak position after taking into account the effect of quark fragmentation to hadrons .",
    "it is seen from plot * b ) * of fig.25 that by adding the mass of the neutralino @xmath189 gev to the value of the right edge point of the peak @xmath167(@xmath2-jet , @xmath190 85.2 gev one can get the lower limit for the reconstructed stop mass @xmath191  gev which reproduces well the input value @xmath25 gev .",
    "the simulation has shown ( see plot * b ) * of fig.27 ) that the 12 background top events , which have passed our cuts ( 14)-(16 ) , as discussed above , are mostly distributed in the region @xmath192(@xmath2-jet , @xmath193)@xmath194 gev .",
    "this region is by more than twenty times wider than the 5 gev width of the peak interval in the @xmath167(@xmath2-jet , @xmath193 ) distribution which is shown in plot * b ) * of fig.25 for the stop and which contains about 290 signal stop events left after the cuts .",
    "therefore , we expect that in future measurements the contribution of these twelve remaining top background events will not influence the position of the peak of the @xmath167(@xmath2-jet , @xmath193 ) distribution ( shown in plot * b ) * of fig.25 ) which allows one to reconstruct the input value of the stop mass by adding the mass of the neutralino .",
    "in this section we want to discuss what will change if the mass of the top squark is different from the one we have chosen . in the present paper",
    "we have chosen a rather low scalar top quark mass ( one of the lowest stop quark s masses that is allowed for the case of @xmath3 decay channel ) .",
    "with increase of the stop mass the cross section for its production is decreasing .",
    "so , for example , for the case of @xmath196 gev and the integrated luminosity @xmath166 the number of events per year at @xmath197500 gev is decreasing to 509 ( after the cuts ( 14)(16 ) ) .",
    "the mass @xmath196 gev is still below the highest allowed stop mass for the @xmath3 decay channel ( which is about 255 gev ) corresponding to @xmath47 gev and @xmath48 gev . for",
    "stop masses below and above the described region , the stop will decay to other channels which we do not consider in this paper . the distribution of the invariant mass @xmath167(@xmath168 , @xmath84 ) of the `` @xmath2-jet+@xmath198 '' system for events which have passed the same cuts ( 14)(16 ) is shown in fig.27 .",
    "plot * a ) * is for stop production with @xmath196 gev , plot * b ) * is for top production .",
    "the top background also remains the same as it was given in table 2 for @xmath197500 gev , i.e. , about 12 events .",
    "-0.5 cm    the distribution in plot * a ) * has a peak at @xmath167(@xmath199,@xmath200 110 gev .",
    "one can also determine the mass of the stop quark following the procedure described in section 7 , but with less accuracy than in the case of the lower stop mass used in previous sections .",
    "we have studied stop pair production in electron - positron collisions within the framework of the mssm for the total energies @xmath24 = 350 , 400 , 500 , 800 , 1000 gev .",
    "we assume that the stop quark decays dominantly into a chargino and a @xmath2-quark , @xmath3 , and the chargino decays into a neutralino and a w boson , @xmath201 , where the w boson is virtual .",
    "one of the two w s decays hadronically , @xmath202 , the other one decays leptonically , @xmath203 .",
    "we have performed a detailed study based on a monte carlo simulation with the program pythia6.4 for @xmath204 gev and an integrated luminosity 1000 fb@xmath57 . at this energy",
    "we expect the highest number of the signal events for the chosen stop mass @xmath205 = 167.9 gev .",
    "the program circe1 is used to get the spectra of electron ( positron ) beams taking into account the effects of beamstrahlung .",
    "pythia6.4 is used to simulate stop pair production and decay as well as top pair production being the main background .",
    "three cuts ( 14)-(16 ) have been proposed to separate signal stop events and top background events . for @xmath58 gev and the luminosity 1000 fb@xmath57",
    "they give 1806 signal stop events with 12 background top events .",
    "this is different from the more complicated situation in stop pair production at lhc ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown that the determination of the right edge of the peak position of the invariant mass @xmath167(@xmath2-jet,@xmath206 ) distribution of the `` @xmath2-jet+(all - non-@xmath2-jets ) '' system allows us to measure the mass of the stop quark with a good accuracy based on the statistics corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1000 fb@xmath57 .",
    "for this the mass of @xmath207 has to be known .",
    "as seen from the table 2 the measurements at other energies in the regions @xmath164 gev and @xmath165 gev may allow to enlarge substantially the number of selected signal stop events and to perform a precise measurement of the mass of the scalar top quark .    in the last section we discussed the difference in the main invariant distribution for a @xmath205 = 200 gev .",
    "in conclusion we can say that the @xmath1 channel together with the @xmath208 channel considered in our previous note @xcite is well suited for the study of stop pair production at ilc .",
