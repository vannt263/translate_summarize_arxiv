    "assume that @xmath11 has @xmath27 sources @xmath1 and @xmath27 distinct sinks @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath3 , let @xmath4 denote the min - cut between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and let @xmath28 denote a set of menger s paths from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "we are interested in the number of mergings among paths from different @xmath29 s , denoted by @xmath30 . in this paper",
    "we will count the number of mergings * without * multiplicity : all the mergings at the same edge @xmath20 will be counted as one merging at @xmath20 .",
    "merge at edge @xmath31 and at merged subpath ( or merging ) @xmath32 , and paths @xmath33 merge at edge @xmath34 and at merged subpath ( or merging ) @xmath35.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the motivation for such consideration is more or less obvious in transportation networks : mergings among different groups of transportation paths can cause congestions , which may either decrease the whole network throughput or incur unnecessary cost . the connection between the number of mergings and the encoding complexity in computer networks ,",
    "however , is a bit more subtle , which can be best illustrated by the following three examples in network coding theory ( for a brief introduction to this theory , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the first example is the famous `` butterfly network ''  @xcite . as depicted in figure  [ picthreeeg](a ) , for the purpose of transmitting messages @xmath36 simultaneously from the sender @xmath37 to the receivers @xmath38 , network encoding has to be done at node @xmath39 .",
    "another way to interpret the necessity of network coding at @xmath39 ( for the simultaneous transmission to @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) is as follows : if the transmission to @xmath41 is ignored , menger s paths @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be used to transmit messages @xmath36 from @xmath37 to @xmath40 ; if the transmission to @xmath40 is ignored , menger s paths @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be used to transmit messages @xmath36 from @xmath37 to @xmath41 . for the simultaneous transmission to @xmath40 and @xmath41 ,",
    "merging by these two groups of menger s paths at @xmath46 becomes a `` bottle neck '' , therefore network coding at @xmath39 is required to avoid the possible congestions .",
    "the second example is a variant of the classical butterfly network ( see example 17.2 of  @xcite ; cf .",
    "the two - way channel in page @xmath47 of  @xcite ) with two senders and two receivers , where the sender @xmath48 is attached to the receiver @xmath41 to form a group and the sender @xmath49 is attached to the receiver @xmath40 to form the other group . as depicted in figure  [ picthreeeg](b )",
    ", the two groups wish to exchange messages @xmath50 and @xmath51 through the network .",
    "similarly as in the first example , the edge @xmath31 is where the menger s paths @xmath52 and @xmath53 merge with each other , which is a bottle neck for the simultaneous transmission of messages @xmath36 .",
    "the simultaneous transmission is achievable if upon receiving the messages @xmath50 and @xmath51 , network encoding is performed at the node @xmath54 and the newly derived message @xmath55 is sent over the channel @xmath56 .",
    "the third example is concerned with two sessions of unicast in a network @xcite . as shown in figure  [ picthreeeg](c ) , the sender @xmath48 is to transmit message @xmath50 to the receiver @xmath40 using path @xmath57 .",
    "and the sender @xmath49 is to transmit message @xmath51 to the receiver @xmath41 using two menger s paths @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "since mergings @xmath31 , @xmath46 and @xmath60 become bottle necks for the simultaneous transmission of messages @xmath50 and @xmath51 , network coding at these bottle necks , as shown in figure  [ picthreeeg](c ) , is performed to ensure the simultaneous message transmission .    generally speaking , for a network with multiple groups of menger s paths , each of which is used to transmit a set of messages to a particular sink , network encoding is needed at mergings by different groups of menger s paths . as a result , the number of mergings is the number of network encoding operations required in the network .",
    "so , we are interested in the number of mergings among different groups of menger s paths in such networks .        for the case when all sources in @xmath0 are in fact identical , @xmath61 is defined as the minimum of @xmath30 over all possible menger s path sets @xmath29 s , @xmath3 , and @xmath62 is defined as the supremum of @xmath61 over all possible choices of such @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath61 is the least number of network encoding operations required for a given @xmath0 , and @xmath62 is the largest such number among all such @xmath0 ( with the min - cut between the @xmath63-th pair of source and sink being @xmath4 ) . as for @xmath10 ,",
    "the authors of  @xcite used the idea of `` subtree decomposition '' to first prove that @xmath64 although their idea seems to be difficult to generalize to other parameters , it does allow us to gain deeper understanding about the topological structure of the graphs achieving @xmath65 mergings for this special case .",
    "it was first shown in  @xcite that @xmath66 is finite for all @xmath67 ( see theorem @xmath68 in  @xcite ) , and subsequently @xmath62 is finite for all @xmath69 .    for the case",
    "when all sources in @xmath0 are distinct , @xmath70 is defined as the minimum of @xmath30 over all possible menger s path sets @xmath29 s , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is defined as the supremum of @xmath70 over all possible choices of such @xmath0 .",
    "again , the encoding idea for the second example can be easily generalized to networks , where each receiver is attached to all senders except its associated one .",
    "it is clear that the number of mergings is a tight upper bound for the number of network encoding operations required . for networks with several unicast sessions , in  @xcite ,",
    "an upper bound for the encoding complexity of a network with two unicast sessions was given , as a result of a more general treatment ( to networks with two multicast sessions ) by the authors .",
    "it is easy to see that for networks with multiple unicast sessions ( straightforward generalizations of the third example ) , @xmath9 with appropriate parameters can serve as an upper bound on network encoding complexity .",
    "it was first conjectured that @xmath72 is finite in  @xcite .",
    "more specifically the authors proved that ( see lemma @xmath73 in  @xcite ) if @xmath74 is finite for all @xmath67 , then @xmath72 is finite as well . here",
    ", we remark that we have rephrased the work in  @xcite , since all of them are done using very different languages from ours .    in  @xcite",
    ", we have shown that for any @xmath69 , @xmath62 , @xmath72 are both finite , and we further studied the behaviors of @xmath75 as functions of the min - cuts . in this paper , further continuing the work in  @xcite , we compute exact values of and give tighter bounds on @xmath10 and @xmath9 for certain parameters .    for a path @xmath76 in @xmath0 ,",

    "<S> it is known that by choosing menger s paths appropriately , the number of mergings among different groups of menger s paths is always bounded by a constant , which is independent of the size and the topology of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the tightest such constant for the all the above - mentioned networks is denoted by @xmath7 when all @xmath5 s are distinct , and by @xmath8 when all @xmath5 s are in fact identical . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are closely related to the network encoding complexity for a variety of networks , such as multicast networks , two - way networks and networks with multiple sessions of unicast . using this connection , </S>",
    "<S> we compute in this paper some exact values and bounds in network encoding complexity using a graph theoretical approach . </S>"
