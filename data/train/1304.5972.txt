    "a single layer of hexagonal boron - nitride ( h - bn ) is a wide gap insulator that is very promising for opto - electronic technologies  @xcite , tunnel devices and field - effect transistors  @xcite . according to the well known mermin - wagner theorem  @xcite , the stability of any two dimensional crystal is only possible in the presence of atomic corrugations which distort the perfect honey - comb lattice and allow the atoms to explore the out - of - plane direction .",
    "experimental observations have found ripples in suspended sheets of ge  @xcite and atomistic simulations suggest that the strong bonds between the carbon atoms determine the features of these ripples  @xcite . understanding the behavior of the ripples is important for many reasons  @xcite .",
    "they affect the electronic transport properties , e. g. , in ge the ripples are believed to be one of the dominant scattering sources which limits the electron mobility  @xcite .",
    "h - bn ribbons doped by carbon has recently been proposed  @xcite .",
    "in addition , bn based nanostructures are potential materials for thermal management applications  @xcite because of their high thermal conductivity and sensitivity to isotopic substitution and etc .",
    "therefore , the knowledge of the shape and the temperature dependence of the intrinsic ripples is fundamental to devise novel nano - devices based on this material .",
    "both ge and h - bn sheets have a honeycomb lattice structure , however the different electronic properties and phonon band structure  @xcite results in unequal morphologies and corrugations .",
    "transmission electron microscopy is widely used to resolve the individual atoms in suspended h - bn sheets  @xcite where ripples inherently exist .",
    "first - principle calculations have been performed using small unit cells , periodically replicated , which are unable to model long wavelength corrugations which require thousands of atoms  @xcite while the mechanical properties of a h - bn sheet can be estimated by using dft  @xcite .",
    "conversely , atomistic simulations using molecular dynamics simulations ( md ) enable to study thermo - mechanical properties directly on large scale samples .",
    "the modified tersoff potential  @xcite ( tp ) ( parameterized originally for carbon and silicon ) with various set of parameters have shown to predict reasonable values for the thermo - mechanical properties of the h - bn sheet . in the pioneer work by albe  _",
    "et al _ re - parameterized tp was used to study the impact of energetic boron and nitrogen atoms on a cubic - bn target  @xcite .",

    ", we investigate the thermal rippling behavior of free standing monolayer h - bn by using state of the art molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "we adopted the tp potential re - parametrized by sevik _",
    "et al _ which has been shown to represent the experimental structure and the phonon dispersion of the two - dimensional h - bn sheet .",
    "we found that h - bn is more corrugated and a less stiff material as compared to ge .",
    "the height - height correlations can be explained by the theory for continuum membranes  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we report results of both uniaxial and shear stress of a h - bn sheet and compare it with those found for ge .",
    "the buckling transition for compressed h - bn occurs earlier than for ge and the induced pattern of ripples when subjected to either uniaxial or shear stress shows significant differences .",

    "iii we analyze the behavior of the thermal ripples of a h - bn sheet . here , we obtain the bending rigidity , the heat capacity , the thermal expansion coefficients , and we study the buckling transition of the h - bn sheet when uniaxial external strain and shear stress are applied .",
    "all the results are compared with the ones obtained for a ge sheet . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we present our conclusions .",
    "classical atomistic molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation is employed to simulate large scale samples of h - bn and ge at temperatures varying from 10k up to 1000k .",
    "we used a modified tersoff potential ( which is an ordinary defined potential in the lammps package  @xcite ) according to the parameters proposed by sevik  _ et al _ for the h - bn sheet .",
    "all the parameters and a detailed description of the potential energy is given in ref .",
    "[ ] . to simulate ge we have used the airebo potential  @xcite which is suitable for simulating hydrocarbons .",
    "we employed npt ensemble simulations with @xmath6=0 using the nos - hoover thermostat which enables us to allow the size of the system to equilibrate ( i.e. the size of the system is not fixed ) .",
    "all the reported values have been computed averaging over @xmath7 snapshots taken over uncorrelated samples .",
    "we start with a square shaped h - bn sheet with periodic boundary conditions and initial dimensions 322@xmath8  @xmath4321@xmath8 ( 315@xmath8  @xmath4315@xmath8  for ge ) in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 direction , respectively , which correspond to a total number of @xmath11=37888 atoms , and which are sufficiently large in order to capture the long - wavelength regime .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were adopted in both directions .    to analyze the thermal ripples we computed the diffraction pattern which is typically studied in experiments to detect the size and shape of the corrugations  @xcite .",
    "we obtained also the mean square value of the out - of plane displacements @xmath12 of the atoms and , by following previous works  @xcite , the height - height correlation function @xmath13 which was determined by considering an average of the height between the first neighbors of each atom .",
    "the latter was shown to follow a @xmath14 behavior that is expected from the theory of continuum two - dimensional membranes at large values of @xmath15 in the harmonic approximation ( see below ) . to analyze the differences between the strain induced corrugations in the h - bn and the ge sheets we applied uniaxial and shear stress on both systems as is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in order to apply strain",
    "we set the force on the two ends equal to zero and move the end atoms with an infinitesimal compression step ( @xmath16 ) in the desired direction .",
    "after each compression step we wait for 2ps to allow the system to relax and to ensure that the system is in thermal equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "uniaxial compressive stress is applied along the zig - zag or armchair direction separately , and the shear stress is applied on the armchair edges with the opposite velocity for the top and bottom edges .",
    "the details of the used method of applying the boundary stress can be found in our previous studies  @xcite    the tp function  @xcite used in the lammps package  @xcite can be expressed as    @xmath17    with @xmath18,\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are cutoff functions , the repulsive pair term , and the attractive pair term , respectively . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the distance from atom @xmath24 to atom @xmath25 and the bond order function . the use of tp disregard contributions coming from charge re - distribution which may occur in an ionic crystal .",
    "the inclusion of this effect in h - bn modifies the phonon spectrum significantly only for energies corresponding to the optical modes  @xcite .",
    "the large scale thermal ripples addressed here are governed mainly by the transversal acoustic mode ( ta ) , which accounts for out - of plane fluctuations , and it couples with the in - plane modes which renormalizes the long wave - length behavior , e.g. the bending rigidity @xmath26 can be calculated directly from the ta mode  @xcite . therefore , the charge redistribution is expected not to affect the thermal fluctuations analyzed here and the use of the tp is justified  @xcite .",

    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "this pattern is very similar to the one obtained for the ge sheet  @xcite with the main difference in the distance between the bragg points due to the unequal lattice constant of h - bn and ge . from the zoom plot around @xmath27=(0,0 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) ) one observes the local structure of the central bragg point for these intrinsic thermal ripples of h - bn .",
    "notice that the lack of the presence of the @xmath27=(0,0 ) component is a consequence of the absence of a perfectly flat h - bn sheet .",
    "the signatures of the thermal induced ripples can also be seen in the mean square value of the out - of - plane fluctuations @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) we show @xmath28 as function of temperature . in comparison with ge (",

    "the weaker ( stronger ) the atomic b - n ( c - c ) bonds , the larger ( smaller ) the corrugations in h - bn ( ge ) .",
    "notice that the b - n bond is not pure covalent and it has an ionic character which is due to the different electronegativity between the two elements , i.e. the electrons are localized closer to the n atoms rather than the b atoms .",
    "although this partially ionic structure of the h - bn layer increases the interlayer interaction resulting in a larger hardness of 3d bulk h - bn relative to graphite , it makes the single layer of bn less stiff than graphene .",
    "moreover , the stacking of h - bn sheets in bulk h - bn is aaa stacking which is different for the abc stacking in graphite  @xcite .      accordingly to the two - dimensional theory of continuum membranes the height - height correlation function , in the harmonic approximation , where the out - of - plane and in - plane modes are decoupled , is expected to behave as @xmath29 where @xmath26 is the bending rigidity of the membrane , @xmath11 is the number of atoms of the sample , @xmath30 the surface area per atom and @xmath31 is the boltzmann constant . in the large wavelength limit , i.e. for @xmath32 ,",

    "this figure also reveals that the ripples are not characterized by an unique wave - length and instead follows the behavior expected from continuum membrane theory . * before ending this section it is worthwhile to investigate an alternative method to estimate the bending rigidity ( flexural rigidity ) .",
    "a common method for calculating the bending rigidity of bn - sheet is by performing simulations of bn - nanotubes as a function of its radius ( r ) of the curved tubes and then extrapolating the results to r@xmath35 .",
    "hence , one can calculate the elastic energy of the nanotube as a function of the inverse square of the radius , @xmath36 .",
    "this method was used in ref .  [ 25 ] and in our previous work  @xcite to calculate the zero temperature bending rigidity of ge and h - bn which were found to be 1.46ev and 1.29ev , respectively .",

    "the total energy varies linearly with temperature and gives the corresponding lattice contribution to the molar heat capacity at constant pressure ( the average size of the system after relaxation is taken constant ) which for the h - bn sheet results into @xmath39 which is comparable to the one for a ge sheet , i.e. 24.5(9)@xmath40 and close to the well known classical molar heat capacity , i.e. , @xmath41 @xmath40 , i.e. , the dulong - petit value , where @xmath42 is the universal gas constant .",
