    "@xmath0 cnc (= hr 3623 = hd 78316 ) , one of the best known and studied hgmn stars , is an sb1 spectroscopic binary .",
    "further , a note in the bright star catalogue ( bsc ) indicates that @xmath0 cnc is a triple occultation system with the primary having a rather bright companion ( @xmath4 m = 0.2 mag ) .",
    "a third star of 7.8 mag in v is at a distance of 0.3 mas from the primary .    during a study of @xmath0 cnc",
    "s mnii lines we noticed an asymmetry in the red wings of all balmer lines on an echelle spectrum obtained at the 1 m telescope of the special astrophysical observatory ( sao ) .",
    "a careful reanalysis of all ccd and reticon spectra available to us resulted in the discovery of the secondary s lines in them .",
    "we used spectra of @xmath0 cnc from several observatories , cfht , dao , ohp , crao and sao .",
    "most have s / n ratios greater than 200 , and spectral resolutions between 35000 and 70000 . in our initial search for the possible lines of the secondary , we carefully investigated our sao spectrum and studied regions around the most prominent spectral lines including the caii k line , mgii @xmath5 4481 , and strong fei and feii lines .",
    "we found a few rather broad , shallow features which all gave the same radial velocity as that estimated from the balmer lines .",
    "then we performed a similar search in other spectra of @xmath0 cnc .",
    "table 1 shows our results .",
    "the effective temperatures and the surface gravities of the components of @xmath0 cnc were obtained by fitting the observed spectrophotometry ( adelman & pyper 1979 ) and hydrogen line profiles , taking into account our mass ratio 2.2 @xmath2 0.1 .      these atmospheric parameters together with the ratio of radii result in a flux ratio in the v band of about 11.5 , which is equivalent to a magnitude difference of @xmath4m=2.6 mag .",
    "it is in good agreement with the @xmath4m=2.56 mag difference between the visual magnitude of @xmath0 cnc and that of the third component mentioned in the bsc .",
    "the positions of both stars on their evolutionary tracks indicate that the primary has a mass of about 4.5 @xmath7 and is close to the end of its main - sequence life , while the secondary has a mass about 2 @xmath7 .",
    "we are thankful to dr .",
