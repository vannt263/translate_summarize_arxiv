    "the integrable reaction - diffusion processes have been investigated by various methods on one - dimensional lattice . a class of these models are characterized by a master equation with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "these boundary terms , which determine the probabilities at the boundary of the space of the parameters , are chosen such that the studying of the various reactions becomes possible via a simple master equation .",
    "the basic quantity in these models is the conditional probability @xmath10 , which is the probability of finding particles @xmath11 at time @xmath12 at sites @xmath13 , respectively , if at @xmath14 we have particles @xmath15 at sites @xmath16 , respectively @xcite .",
    "another class of models are those which are solvable through the empty interval method . in these models , the main quantity , in the most general case , is @xmath17 which is the probability that @xmath18 consecutive sites , starting from the site @xmath19 , are empty .",
    "several examples have been investigated by this method @xcite .",
    "the crucial property which causes the above mentioned cases to be analytically solvable , is the dimension of the lattice which particles move on it .",
    "one dimensional lattice is clearly the simplest case .",
    "considering the higher - dimensional lattice in studying the integrable models is obviously a great improvement in theoretical physics .",
    "one of the important example in this area is cayley tree .",
    "a cayley tree is a connected cycle - free graph where each site is connected to @xmath20 neighbor sites .",
    "@xmath20 is called the coordination number .",
    "the cayley tree of coordination number @xmath20 may be constructed by starting from a single central node ( called the root of the lattice ) at shell @xmath21 , which is connected to @xmath20 neighbors at shell @xmath22 .",
    "each of the nodes in shell @xmath23 is connected to @xmath24 nodes in shell @xmath25 .",
    "this construction may stop at shell @xmath26 , or continue indefinitely ( fig.1 ) .",
    "( 135,135 )    the interior of an infinite cayley tree is called the bethe lattice . due to distinctive topological structure of cayley tree ,",
    "the reaction - diffusion processes on this graph may be integrable .",
    "the diffusion - controlled process of cluster growth , introduced by witten and sander @xcite , has been studied on cayley tree in @xcite , and in @xcite , the two - particle annihilation reaction for immobile reactant has been studied on bethe lattice .",
    "diffusion - limited coalescence , @xmath27 , and annihilation , @xmath28 @xcite , and random sequential adsorption @xcite have also been studied on cayley tree .",
    "also the reaction - diffusion processes on cayley tree , solvable through the empty interval method , have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the study of some integrable reaction - diffusion processes on cayley tree . denoting the number of particles on @xmath6-th shell by @xmath29 , we seek the situations in which the probability @xmath30 can be calculated exactly .",
    "@xmath31 is the last shell of the cayley tree . by considering the most general reactions on cayley tree in section 2",
    ", it is shown that we must restrict ourselves to three distinct creation reactions so that a subclass of @xmath8-shell probabilities @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 , becomes solvable .",
    "the exact solution of @xmath34 is obtained in section 3 .",
    "finally in conclusion section it is shown that the diffusion process can also lead to an integrable model , if one restrict himself to one particle probabililities @xmath35 , and if an extra trapping reaction exists at the central node .",
    "an ideal spherical trap , surrounded by a swarm of brownian particles , is a fundamental model which had been first presented by von smoluchowski @xcite , and has been generalized to a mobile trap in @xcite .",
    "also the energy transfer process in dendrimer supermolecule on the cayley tree with a central trap has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "these two models are only integrable models in this context",
    ".    it must be added that the procedure introduced in this paper can be easily extended to the situations in which the number of occupied shells is greater than one , but there must exist at least one empty shell between any two of them .",
    "the most general reactions of single species models with nearest - neighbor interactions are @xmath36 where an empty ( occupied ) site is denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath38s are reaction rates and there is no distinction between left and right .",
    "our main goal is to find the situations which lead to integrable models . by integrability , we mean the possibility of the exact calculation of probabilities @xmath39 .",
    "the necessary condition for achieving this goal is that the occupation numbers of shells ( the number of occupied sites of every shell ) must be the only parameters needed to characterize the configurations .",
    "clearly this is not the case if two adjacent shells are occupied .",
    "for example consider @xmath40 and the reaction ( 1 ) of eq.(1 ) . in figs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) , the source terms of two different configurations ( a ) and ( b ) , with same occupation numbers @xmath41 , are shown .",
    "as it is seen , the configuration ( a ) has two source terms , while the configuration ( b ) has three .",
    "the number behind each configuration is its multiplicity , i.e. the number of ways which this configuration can lead to the desired state .",
    "this shows that if two adjacent shells are occupied , it is not possible to write the same evolution equation for different configurations of a given occupation numbers .",
    "therefore , we only consider the situations in which there is only one non - zero occupation number , i.e. @xmath42 . as mentioned earlier , it is possible to extend our procedure to the situations in which there is at least one empty shell between any two occupied shells .",
    "( 75,75 )    ( 70,70 )    considering the probabilities @xmath43 , we must yet check whether all the reactions of eq.([1 ] ) are acceptable or not . by the term",
    "acceptable , we mean to have two properties .",
    "first , the determination of occupation number @xmath5 is sufficient for having a unique evolution equation , irrespective of particles distribution .",
    "second , all the terms of evolution equation are expressible in terms of @xmath44s .",
    "now it can be seen that this is not the case for reactions ( 4)-(7 ) of eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "this is because in all these cases , the source terms of @xmath4s are @xmath45-shell probabilities @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which can not be expressed in terms of @xmath44s . for these reactions ,",
    "the master equations are : @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively . the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 are some constants .",
    "the case @xmath54 is an exception which will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "so the integrable model , through the @xmath34 probabilities , is a model in which the allowed reactions are reactions ( 1)-(3 ) of eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "the evolution equation of @xmath34 on a cayley tree with coordination number @xmath20 and @xmath8 shells then becomes ( for @xmath55 ) @xmath56p_{l}(m;t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in above equation @xmath57 is the number of sites of the @xmath6-th shell .",
    "the first term in the right - hand site of eq.([3 ] ) is the source term of reaction ( 1 ) , and @xmath58 is its sink term .",
    "this is because @xmath59 is the number of empty pairs ( @xmath60 ) of a cayley tree with @xmath5 particles on shell @xmath6 , which each of them can change to either @xmath61 or @xmath62 with rate @xmath63 .",
    "the reaction ( 2 ) has no source term for @xmath34 , and its sink term is clearly @xmath64 .",
    "finally the reaction 3 does not have source term , and its sink term is @xmath65 because each of the neighbors of each particles of @xmath6-th shell can be changed via @xmath2 reaction .    for @xmath26 ,",
    "since there is no upper shell , the number of neighboring sites of each occupied site is one , instead of @xmath20 .",
    "therefore for @xmath66 , the evolution equation is same as eq.([3 ] ) , when @xmath20 is replaced by 1 .",
    "in this section we try to solve the master equation @xmath67p_l(m;t)\\ \\ \\ ( l < l),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath68 in two cases @xmath69 and @xmath70 . for @xmath26 , we must set @xmath71 in eq.([5 ] ) .      to solve eq.([5 ] )",
    ", we use a recursive method .",
    "we first consider the case @xmath73 , where eq.([5 ] ) is reduced to @xmath74 with solution @xmath75 @xmath76 is the probability of finding no particle in shell @xmath6 at @xmath14 . inserting eq.([7 ] ) in @xmath54 case of eq.([5 ] ) , results in @xmath35 as follows @xmath77   e^{-[z(r_3-r_2 - 2r_1)+n(2r_1+r_2)]t}\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{n_lr_1p_l(0 ) }   { r_3-r_2 - 2r_1}e^{-n(2r_1+r_2)t}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] continuing this method , one can deduce the following general expression for @xmath4 : @xmath78t}\\ \\ \\",
    "( l < l),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which , as we will show , @xmath79 .",
    "it can be seen that for @xmath73 and @xmath54 , eq.([9 ] ) leads to eqs.([7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) , respectively . to prove that eq.([9 ] )",
    "is the solution of eq.([5 ] ) , we insert it in eq.([5 ] ) .",
    "the summations in the left - hand side and in the second term of the right - hand side of eq.([5 ] ) are both @xmath80 .",
    "if we write them as @xmath81 , then it can be seen that the @xmath82 terms in both sides are the same , and therefore they are cancelled .",
    "so in all three terms of eq.([5 ] ) , the summations have the same form @xmath83 , which after some simple calculations , it can be shown that the remaining terms are cancelled , which proves the expression ( [ 9 ] ) satisfies the master equation ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "note that because of the @xmath84 factor in the denominator of eq.([9 ] ) , @xmath4 satisfies @xmath85 which shows the correct behavior of eq.([9 ] ) .",
    "it is also necessary to prove the physical interpretation of @xmath86 as @xmath87 . to see this , we consider eq.([9 ] ) at @xmath14 : @xmath88 in which we use the equality : @xmath89 using @xmath90 , eq.([11 ] ) becomes @xmath91 from binomial expansion @xmath92",
    "one finds for @xmath93 @xmath94 so the last summation of eq.([13 ] ) is zero for all @xmath95 , or @xmath96 .",
    "the only remaining term is @xmath97 , which results in @xmath98 this completes the proof of eq.([9 ] ) as the exact solution of the master equation ( [ 5 ] ) , with @xmath86s as the initial values of probabilities .",
    "the probability @xmath99 is found from ( [ 9 ] ) , by taking @xmath26 and @xmath71 .",
    "eq.([9 ] ) gives the probability of finding @xmath5 particles at time @xmath12 on shell @xmath6 , when all other shells are empty , if we begin with any number of particles on shell @xmath6 at @xmath14 .",
    "of course for a specific initial condition , i.e. @xmath100 , only one term of summation @xmath101 survives .      for the case",
    "@xmath102 , the master equation ( [ 5 ] ) becomes @xmath103 using the method of the previous case , the solution of above equation is found to be @xmath104 it can be easily shown that the solution ( [ 18 ] ) satisfies ( [ 17 ] ) and has the desired properties @xmath105 and @xmath106 . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the solution is found from eq.([18 ] ) , by taking @xmath26 and @xmath71 .",
    "to study the integrable reaction - diffusion processes on a more - than - one - dimensional lattices , the most general interactions ( [ 1 ] ) have been considered on a cayley tree with coordination number @xmath20 .",
    "it has been shown that among the probability functions , the probabilities @xmath4s are independent of distribution of particles on various shells , and may lead to integrable models if we consider two situations .",
    "the first one is the creation - reactions ( 1)-(3 ) of eq.([1 ] ) , with master equation ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath4s for two cases @xmath107 and @xmath102 have been considered in section 3 , with the final exact results ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 18 ] ) , respectively .    as is clear from eqs.([a])-([d ] ) , in the case @xmath54 , the master equations ( [ b])-([d ] ) still contain the @xmath45-shell probabilities , but for diffusion process @xmath108 , only the one - shell probabilities ( i.e. one point functions ) appear in eq.([a ] ) , which may lead to an integrable model .",
    "the master equation of @xmath7 , with @xmath109 , for diffusion process on a cayley tree with coordination number @xmath20 is : @xmath110 in which the diffusion rate @xmath111 has been absorbed in the rescaling of time @xmath12 .",
    "the evolution equations of @xmath112 and @xmath113 are @xmath114 and @xmath115 respectively .",
    "these equations take a form similar to eq.([19 ] ) , provided one defines @xmath116 @xmath117 the first boundary condition is trivially satisfied , since @xmath4s have been defined for @xmath118 .",
    "but the second one indicates a trapped reaction at the origin .",
    "so eq.([19 ] ) , with arbitrary @xmath6 , defines an integrable model on a cayley tree if the particles have diffusion process , and if there exists a trap at the root of the lattice .",
    "when the reactions are coalescence @xmath27 and annihilation @xmath28 , the density of particles in shell @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath119 , has been calculated in @xcite for the same situation , that is a trap at the root of a cayley tree .",
    "finally it must be added that it remains one more case which may lead to an integrable model .",
    "looking at eqs.([a])-([d ] ) , it is clear that if one takes @xmath73 , only the master equation ( [ b ] ) leads to an equation which only consists of one - point functions , i.e. @xmath122 it can be shown that @xmath123 .",
    "but the point is that the determination of @xmath124s depends on the evaluation of @xmath7s , which can not be calculated .",
    "this is because the master equation of @xmath7s contains the two - point probabilities @xmath125 and therefore is not closed .",
    "therefore the two considered models are the only cases which can be exactly solved .",
