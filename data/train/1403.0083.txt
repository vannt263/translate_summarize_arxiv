    "the departure increases with wave number @xmath0 .",
    "but at relative low redshift , the growth rate in eibi gravity approaches to that in the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "the suppression ( for positive @xmath43 ) or enhancement ( for negative @xmath43 ) on the growth of density perturbation at early time for large @xmath0 affects the linear matter power spectrum on small scales ( large @xmath0 ) . for @xmath139mpc@xmath3 , the matter power spectrum in eibi gravity with positive @xmath43 is lower than that in the @xmath1cdm . and for negative @xmath43 , it is just the opposite .",
    "so it is prospective to use the observational matter power spectrum to test eibi gravity and constrain the parameter @xmath140 .",
    "if we require that the linear matter power spectrum in eibi gravity does not deviate significantly from that in the @xmath1cdm model , the parameter @xmath115 should be the order of @xmath141 or smaller . at present",
    "it is still not a very strong constraint . in ref .",
    "@xcite , avelino obtained @xmath5kg@xmath3m@xmath6s@xmath7 by requiring that gravity plays a subdominant role inside atomic nuclei , which leads to @xmath142 .",
    "if we consider this constraint , there will be no distinguishable deviation .",
    "besides , we also calculate the integrated sachs - wolfe effect in eibi gravity , and find that its effect on the angular power spectrum of cmb is almost the same as that in the @xmath1cdm model",
    ".    however , some work still needs to be done before we can compare the predictions of eibi gravity directly with observations .",
    "first , we must also analyze in detail the evolution of scalar perturbations at a much earlier time when the universe is dominated by radiation , and the transition from a radiation - dominated universe to a matter - dominated one .",
    "along with these analyses , we can obtain more accurate transfer function by modifying corresponding numerical codes such as camb , cmbfast and cmbquick .",
    "secondly , to distinguish eibi gravity with @xmath1cdm model , we need to compare the evolution of perturbations with large @xmath0 , at which wave number nonlinear effect can not be neglected .",
    "this can be solved by following the halo - based description of nonlinear gravitational clustering @xcite or using numerical simulations .",
    "although within this paper , we can not yet give a strong constraint on the parameter @xmath4 comparable with that derived from other methods such as considering the compact objects or structure of nucleon , we have shown some interesting behaviors of eibi gravity on large scale structure formation , especially the linear matter power spectrum .",
    "an analysis of nonlinear matter power spectrum in future papers will give a stronger constraint on the deviations from general gravity .",
    "furthermore , despite the success of @xmath1cdm model in predicting the large scale structure , it may have some problems on small scales , such as the missing satellites problem or the cuspy halo problem .",
    "so it is motivated to consider some modifications on these scales .",
