    "relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments at rhic in bnl and at lhc in cern have successfully created a quark - gluon plasma and probed into its detailed properties ; among milestones in the quark - gluon plasma research , the recognition of the so - called _ perfect fluidity _ , i.e.  smallness of the shear viscosity to the entropy density ratio was the most influential one , which has triggered interdisciplinary discussions over many fields including nuclear physics and super - string theories .    thanks to the tremendous developments of the lattice simulation of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite and the ( dissipative ) hydrodynamic model  @xcite , we have reached a reasonable understanding on the static properties of high-@xmath0 qcd matter and the subsequent dynamical evolution .",
    "it is , however , still far from establishing a firm theoretical framework for the pre - thermalization stage . generally speaking",
    ", the thermalization process out of equilibrium is a ubiquitous but complicated problem , and theoretical research mostly relies on numerical methods .    luckily , in the case of the relativistic heavy - ion collision at high enough energy , the very early - time dynamics at the time scale of order of @xmath1 can be expressed in terms of coherent gluon fields , where @xmath2 is the saturation momentum  @xcite .",
    "the initial state characterized by @xmath2 is sometimes referred to as the `` glasma '' initial condition  @xcite . in this glasma picture",
    "the most important is the presence of boost - invariant longitudinal chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic fields , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the intensity of which is given by @xmath2 again .",
    "in contrast to the glasma stage , the time scale when the hydrodynamic model starts working is of order @xmath5 .",
    "it is an urgent theoretical problem to fill in the gap between these times scales . along this line",
    "there are many theoretical attempts based on the glasma simulation  @xcite , the plasma instability  @xcite , the hard - loop expansion  @xcite , the kinetic description  @xcite , the holographic duals  @xcite , and the classical yang - mills simulations  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we solve the yang - mills equation of motions starting with the glasma initial condition .",
    "the question is then ; what is the most likely candidate for the mechanism to `` decohere '' the longitudinal @xmath3 and @xmath4 in such a short time scale .",
    "this kind of decoherence problem is a quite generic problem we may encounter in various circumstances ( see e.g.  @xcite for a scalar - model study ) .",
    "our proposal is that the turbulent diffusion should be the driving force for this ; indeed it is known in many physical phenomena that the turbulence is a much faster process than the typical molecular diffusion by several orders of magnitude .    in the context of the rhic and lhc physics ,",
    "the role of the turbulence has been emphasized as a possible account for the smallness of the viscosity to the entropy density ratio  @xcite  because the energy transport goes efficiently , an anomalously small viscosity arises generally in a turbulent flow .",
    "the actual calculation assumes a random background distribution of chromo - fields  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we still need to consider from where these fields are generated , and the glasma simulation is indispensable to answer such a question .",
    "the turbulence , especially the wave turbulence , has also been investigated numerically and analytically  @xcite .",
    "it has been understood that the kolmogorov - type cascade leads to a power - law spectrum ( where the power index may take different values at strong coupling ) .",
    "the kolmogorov behavior is , however , realized in a system with a well - developed inertial region  @xcite .",
    "this means that we have to wait for a certain time until the power - law spectrum grows steadily , while what we want to clarify is not the steadiness but the rapid reorganization from the initial state .",
    "we should , hence , disturb the initial system with substantially large fluctuations that breach the boost invariance .    for this purpose , in this work , we turn off the effect of the expanding geometry .",
    "we do this because the expanding geometry is singular at the initial time and it is difficult to disturb the initial state without ambiguity .",
    "besides , the expansion quickly renders the transverse dynamics frozen , and thus , one should carefully formulate the initial spectral shape ( involving the uv divergence ) and also elaborate the proper renormalization ( or subtraction ) procedures  @xcite .",
    "otherwise , useful information on underlying physics can be easily diluted and even concealed by the effect of expansion .",
    "these are not simply technical problems ; the expanding geometry represents curved space - time and quantum fluctuations on such curved space - time are distorted , so that the physical vacuum should be bogoliubov transformed from the vacuum in flat space - time .",
    "interestingly enough , as we will find later , a particular initial condition corresponding to the heavy - ion collision already captures the essential features of the anisotropic dynamics .",
    "moreover , we have checked whether we can confirm the same observation using a code for the expanding case , and have found similar behavior if we employ large fluctuations , while the non - expanding simulation always leads to inhomogeneous pattern formation for any ( small ) fluctuations .",
    "one might feel that the approximation to adopt a non - expanding box be artificial simplification .",
    "however , it is just obvious that the expansion effects should delay the decohering processes , and therefore , one must first understand the decohering mechanism for the non - expanding system ; otherwise it is impossible to give any account for the expanding case",
    ". then , one should test the presumed mechanism to see whether it works to overcome the delay in the expanding case .",
    "this is why we dare to drop the expansion off ; the relevance to the experiment becomes less , but the theory becomes more well - behaved thanks to this simplification .",
    "the most important point in this work is that the longitudinal and the transverse dynamics behave totally differently at early time when the anisotropy from the collision geometry is huge .",
    "one can presume by intuition that the longitudinal decoherence should go much faster than the transverse one ; otherwise the isotropization is never achieved .",
    "indeed we will confirm this anticipation , and find that it indeed happens in a very interesting manner .",
    "most importantly , we can make use of the glasma initial condition  @xcite as it is even in the non - expanding case because the initial fields lie only on the transverse plane . in terms of the link variables on the lattice",
    ", the canonical momenta leads to the following time evolution , @xmath6 u_i(t ) \\;,\\ ] ] where the time arguments are shifted in accord to the leapfrog algorithm which preserves the gauss law exactly .",
    "we omit writing the lattice spacing @xmath7 throughout this paper .",
    "the classical yang - mills equations of motion ( hamilton s equations ) read , @xmath8   \\end{split}\\ ] ] in the temporal axial gauge ; @xmath9 .",
    "the initial condition is given in a standard way , which simplifies particularly for the su(2 ) color group  @xcite as @xmath10 \\notag\\\\   & \\quad\\times\\bigl [ u_i^{(2)\\dagger}(x\\!-\\!\\delta x_i )            \\!-\\ ! u_i^{(1)\\dagger}(x\\!-\\!\\delta x_i ) \\bigr ]     - \\text{(h.c . ) } \\bigr\\ } \\label{eq : ini2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the pure gauge configurations , @xmath11 , and the gauge rotation , @xmath12 , by the static potential obtained as a solution of the poisson equation , @xmath13 .",
    "we assume the gaussian distribution for the color source ; @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is supposed to be related to the characteristic scale @xmath2 as was mentioned in the previous section .",
    "if we solved the time evolution with the initial condition   and , there would appear no dependence on the longitudinal coordinate ( i.e.  @xmath16 in the present case without expansion , corresponding to @xmath17 in the bjorken coordinates ) .",
    "this means that qcd color strings extend along the @xmath16-direction at initial time .",
    "we shall introduce a minimal perturbation to make it the clearest how these strings are disrupted by extra fluctuations ; @xmath18 \\xi^i \\;,~~   f(z)=\\delta\\cos(2\\pi z / l_z ) \\ ; , \\label{eq : fluc}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 solved from the gauss law . in this way we put a seed of electric - field amplitude @xmath21 at the lowest non - zero momentum @xmath22 .",
    "as long as the instability stays weak , the linear superposition gives a good approximation for the results with more general fluctuations  @xcite . in this work , however , we will also choose a non - small @xmath23 to test the robustness of what we discover . in principle , we should generate the quantum fluctuations according to the ground state ( gaussian ) wave - function , and take the ensemble average over all fluctuations , which would lead to the uv divergence of the zero - point oscillation energy . to avoid this complication , in this work",
    ", we pick up a `` representative '' of the configuration by eq .  .",
    "this simplification would affect quantitative details such as the precise time scale of the decoherence , but should be harmless to the qualitative nature of the phenomenon that we will discuss .",
    "first let us address the case without @xmath16-dependent fluctuations",
    ". with unbroken translational invariance in the @xmath16-direction , the transverse pressure @xmath24 approaches a finite value , while the longitudinal pressure @xmath25 decreases to vanish asymptotically , where they are , respectively , defined as @xmath26 \\ ; ,   \\notag\\\\   & { p_{\\text{t}}}= { \\text{tr}}\\bigl [ ( e^z)^2 + ( b^z)^2 \\bigr ] \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in our numerical computation we use @xmath27 ( corresponding to the choice @xmath28 ) with @xmath29 and the transverse and longitudinal site numbers , @xmath30 .",
    "we note that the initial energy density is both uv and ir singular  @xcite : @xmath31 ^ 2 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are uv and ir cutoff scales , respectively .",
    "this singularity is problematic in a non - expanding box , while the time evolution soon diminishes this singularity in the expanding case  @xcite . in our numerical simulation ,",
    "thus , we need to introduce a uv cutoff @xmath34 when we solve the poisson equation , i.e.  higher modes with @xmath35 are dropped to get the results presented in this paper .",
    "we have then confirmed that our results have only minor dependence on @xmath36 as long as we keep the same @xmath34 .",
    "we also note that , because of the color string , the initial @xmath25 starts from a negative value ( i.e.  two nuclei feel an attractive force ) .",
    "it is already a non - trivial observation that @xmath25 vanishes at late time . in the expanding case ,",
    "since the system is stretched and diluted , one may anticipate @xmath37 as a result of the free streaming . in the present simulation ,",
    "however , the box does not expand and nothing streams out , so that @xmath37 is purely realized by the choice of the initial conditions   and .",
    "this implies that @xmath37 even in the expanding glasma should be attributed to not the expansion but the initial conditions . in other words ,",
    "the free streaming is not the reason , but the physical interpretation of the result .     as a function of dimensionless time . without fluctuation",
    "the ratio approaches zero , while it goes to a non - zero constant if fluctuations are implemented .",
    "an ensemble average is taken over 50 configurations . ]",
    "we shall next proceed to the results with @xmath16-disturbing fluctuations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure ] .",
    "we here adopt three different @xmath23 ; a substantially large @xmath38 gives the energy density from fluctuations of the same order of magnitude as the background fields .",
    "therefore , this value is a kind of upper bound above which solving the classical equations of motion is no longer justified .",
    "a marginal @xmath39 is much safer ; the initial energy density is dominated by the background fields , and the time evolution is almost identical with the case with even smaller @xmath40 , as is manifested in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure ] .",
    "( to avoid making the figure too busy , we did not show the fluctuation - free results with @xmath41 that behave like the results with @xmath39 or @xmath42 till @xmath43 , and monotonically approach zero beyond it . )",
    "there are two interesting observations that one can notice at a glance .",
    "first , the choices of @xmath39 and @xmath40 make only little change in the onset of the instability around @xmath44 where @xmath45 start growing .",
    "owing to this , we can be so sure that our results should be robust at least on a qualitative level regardless of our ignorance about the precise value of @xmath23 .",
    "second , if @xmath23 is less than @xmath46 , we can not reach the complete isotropization .",
    "this is quite unexpected : because the simulation runs in the isotropic setup , the anisotropy given at the initial time should naturally fade out if we wait for a sufficiently long time .",
    "this intuition is correct , but the point is that it takes an extraordinarily long time unless @xmath23 is such large that it also modifies the initial energy density .",
    "it is quite instructive to see that _ the isotropization at later time is a very slow process _ even in a non - expanding and symmetric box .    to discuss more microscopic dynamics ,",
    "we shall split the time evolution into three distinct characteristic regimes as follows .",
    "the pressure has oscillatory behavior in the earliest stage ( i.e.@xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath39 as deduced from fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure ] ) .",
    "the so - called glasma instability must be developing from lower to higher longitudinal modes , but their effects are not yet appreciable in the bulk thermodynamics at zero mode . in the phenomenological sense ,",
    "the theoretical understanding in this regime is the most crucial issue , while many theoretical efforts had been devoted to rather later - time dynamics .",
    "hence , our central objective in this present paper is to shed light on this oscillatory regime .    obviously , the equation of state still has fast components in time , which means that the derivative expansion should not work .",
    "one can not therefore apply the hydrodynamic equations to describe the time evolution yet .",
    "then , a natural question arises ; what about the spatial structure ?",
    "is it already smooth enough or linked somehow to the rough structure in time ?        to diagnose the microscopic dynamics , we make 3d and density plots to illustrate the cascade flow of the energy spectrum toward higher @xmath50 or the wave number @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 ) in the longitudinal direction .",
    "we define the following energy spectrum with only the @xmath16-direction fourier transformed as @xmath53\\ ; ,   \\end{split}\\ ] ] which is measured for each configuration .",
    "this is not a gauge invariant quantity and we need to fix the gauge to _ define _ it uniquely .",
    "we already chose the temporal axial gauge but time - independent gauge rotations are still redundant , which does not change the gauge - invariant observable but modifies @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , we fix the initial gauge configurations   and ( with fluctuations included ) to satisfy the coulomb - gauge condition @xmath55 that would flatten spiky textures .",
    "we used the over - relaxation method with 1000 steps to impose the coulomb gauge and explicitly checked that the gauge configurations become extremely smooth then .    for qualitative discussions we may choose any @xmath23 , in principle , but to remove an impression that our findings come from artificially large @xmath23",
    ", we here adopt a rather safer choice of @xmath39 that has no effect on the very early dynamics as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure ] . then , for graphical purpose , we pick a slice of @xmath56 up and make a 3d plot of @xmath54 as a function of @xmath57 and @xmath51 in fig .  [",
    "fig : avalanche ] for _ one _ configuration .",
    "we can understand from fig .",
    "[ fig : avalanche ] what is actually happening on the microscopic level during the oscillatory regime . in this very first stage",
    "the energy amplitude spreads toward larger @xmath50 triggered by spots localized in @xmath57 ( and @xmath58 ) space .",
    "these localized spots look like narrow avalanches .",
    "let us here `` define '' what we really mean by _ avalanche _ for clarify .     for @xmath39 at @xmath59 at the initial time @xmath60 shown in the linear scale .",
    "]    to do so , we have to magnify the initial energy stored at @xmath59 mode , which is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : init ] .",
    "it should be noted that this is nothing but the energy distribution already shown in the very left of fig .",
    "[ fig : avalanche ] in a form of the logarithmic plot .",
    "even though fig .",
    "[ fig : init ] may look like having a rough structure , the energy fluctuates within only one order of magnitude .",
    "it is evident from the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : avalanche ] that the inhomogeneity developing later at larger @xmath51 is correlated to the initial pattern , and the resulting intensity differs by more than ten orders of magnitude ! we would call this huge ( but relative ) amplification of the spatial pattern the _ avalanche _ phenomenon .",
    "this type of the avalanche phenomenon is quite common in many physics problems .",
    "the avalanche breakdown of insulator or semi - conductor is one familiar example in which free electrons trigger the creation of electron - hole pair . in the present glasma simulation ,",
    "we have specified both the initial conditions  , , and the initial fluctuations   according to the gaussian distribution , and some local positions happen to have irregular amplitudes as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : init ] , which is responsible for the avalanches .",
    "probably they have much to do with the magnetic vortices discovered recently in the same model setup  @xcite .",
    "we here point out that these narrow avalanches are collective consequences from the simultaneous existence of the glasma fields and the fluctuation fields .",
    "we turned the glasma background fields off as a test calculation , and we found that the amplitudes just smoothly and slowly decayed into higher @xmath50 , but no rapid narrow avalanche emerged .",
    "these avalanche - like structures gradually spread over @xmath57 ( and @xmath58 ) space as the time elapses , and eventually the distribution appears uniform in transverse space at further later time , which we call the _",
    "transverse diffusion_. to access the full transverse structure and visualize the diffusion , we show @xmath54 as snapshots in fig .",
    "[ fig : snap ] at @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 using the same configuration to draw fig .",
    "[ fig : avalanche ] .",
    "we can then clearly perceive the dynamical pattern formation in transverse geometry and subsequent diffusion ; at localized spots with brighter colors we have larger amplitudes for the maximum @xmath50 mode , namely , @xmath64 ( in unit of @xmath65 ) . to the best of our knowledge",
    "the present analysis is the very first demonstration that has revealed the spontaneous generation of spatial pattern in the real - time simulation of the yang - mills theory . at the same time as we emphasize the novelty",
    ", we would also like to draw attention to the similarity to many other systems out of equilibrium : one intuitive example lies in the formation of the magnetized domains described by the time - dependent ginzburg - landau theory of the classical spin models .",
    "such a pattern has been numerically discovered in the direction from the random initial state to the ordered spin state at lower @xmath0 , and amazingly also in the opposite direction from the enforced ordered ( or coherent ) state to the disordered ( or decoherent ) spin state at high @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "our results are reminiscent of the latter associated with non - equilibrium decohering processes .     as a function of the transverse wave - number , normalized by the zero - mode value .",
    "the ensemble average is taken over 50 configurations . ]",
    "let us quantify the transverse diffusion processes by calculating the energy - density correlation function from fig .",
    "[ fig : snap ] or the `` power spectrum '' defined by @xmath66 where we note that the meaning of @xmath67 is totally different from @xmath50 ; we introduced @xmath67 as a fourier transform of @xmath57 and @xmath58 of @xmath54 , while @xmath50 refers to the momentum carried by the chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic fields .",
    "to absorb orders of magnitude difference at different time , we normalize the power spectrum by the zero - mode value @xmath68 and draw fig .",
    "[ fig : power ] for @xmath69 , @xmath62 , and @xmath70 .",
    "we can clearly confirm that the long - range correlation becomes more and more enhanced as the time goes , which is quite consistent with what we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : snap ] .",
    "( we note that the wave - number , say 10 on this plot , corresponds to the physical scale , @xmath71 . ) the reason why the normalized power spectrum seemingly looks more suppressed at larger @xmath72 is that the zero - mode grows larger .",
    "thus the relative height decreases , though the absolute height is much larger at later time .",
    "it should be clearly noted here that we should _ not _ take this enhancement of the long - range correlation for a signal of the bose - einstein condensate speculated as in @xcite .",
    "we are now looking at not the particle distribution but the energy - density correlation .",
    "we observe that the spots in the transverse plane spread out quickly toward uniformity , which is to be interpreted as the diffusion as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : snap ] .      after some time ( @xmath73 for @xmath48 and @xmath74 for @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure ] ) the equation of state behaves smoothly enough in time and also in space , which should enable the hydrodynamic evolution to work fine during this regime since the derivative expansion makes sense .",
    "the system still goes on approaching isotropization , and thus it is neither isotropic nor thermalized yet .",
    "an important question is what determines the typical time scale for the transition from the oscillatory regime to the growing regime . in other words",
    ", we need to know what is still missing to accelerate the onset time for the hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "the time scale is characterized by the balance between the initial energy density stored at the zero mode and the rate of the energy flow that is intrinsically determined by the yang - mills interactions . within the present framework",
    "it is difficult to yield the onset time around a few times @xmath75 as required by the analysis of the experimental data .",
    "it is important not to be confused with the behavior of the most unstable mode in the expanding case  @xcite that looks very similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure ] . in the expanding case",
    "the onset is delayed simply by the kinematical reason  @xcite , and in the non - expanding case in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure ] it is not the most unstable component but the whole pressure that we are dealing with .",
    "therefore it takes time for the instability to spread over the whole phase space .",
    "the diffusion is caused by inhomogeneity , and so it becomes slower and slower with less and less inhomogeneity and anisotropy .",
    "naturally the tendency toward isotropization becomes weakened as @xmath25 and @xmath24 get closer to each other .",
    "in such an asymptotic regime ( @xmath76 for @xmath48 and @xmath77 for @xmath39 in fig .  [",
    "fig : pressure ] ) the characteristic time scale is unphysically long . from the experimental point of view , all theoretical considerations in this late regime are irrelevant to the thermalization problem .",
    "nevertheless , as a rather `` academic '' problem to investigate the non - linear dynamics of the yang - mills theory , it is worth paying our attention to microscopic details in this asymptotic regime .     given as a function of dimensionless time . ]    usually some kind of scaling law may be observed in a well - developed turbulent system at late time . in the present simulation with specific initial conditions   and ,",
    "however , the zero mode can not be a consistent source to supply the energy injection and so it can not sustain a steady inertial region in the energy spectrum .",
    "still , there may be a chance to see scaling behavior at the tail of the energy spectrum .",
    "to test this idea , we attempt to fit the longitudinal energy spectrum by the power - law spectrum @xmath78 , and we find that the fit works well in the range , @xmath79 .",
    "then , the power @xmath80 turns out to be a function of time as in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] .",
    "the value of the index @xmath80 decreases with increasing time , which crosses the kolmogorov value @xmath81 and becomes even smaller . as we discussed above , the inertial region is not stable and the precise value of @xmath80 is not very important in the present case but this level of qualitative agreement is quite suggestive .",
    "one might care about the consistency with ref .",
    "@xcite in which a stable power - law has been identified .",
    "we note that this difference between the present analysis and ref .",
    "@xcite comes from the totally different choice of the initial conditions   and that resemble the anisotropy in the heavy - ion collision .",
    "with the results from our numerical simulations , we can arrive at the following picture of the very early - time stage in the relativistic heavy - ion collision , as is sketched in the illustration of fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "the fastest process is driven by the avalanche - like decay along the longitudinal direction which takes place locally in transverse plane .",
    "these avalanches are to be attributed to initial fluctuations .",
    "once this occurs , the boost invariance or the @xmath16-invariance is quickly but only locally broken as in the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "this view also invokes the famous reynolds experiment of the turbulent flow inside of a pipe  @xcite where the translationally steady flow of ink begins wandering under disturbances if reynolds number exceeds a critical point . from this analogy",
    "it may well be reasonable to identify these local avalanches as appearance of a sort of fluid turbulence . also , it would be conceivable to associate them with the qcd string breaking which is accompanied by the particle production .",
    "the next vital fast process is the diffusion over the transverse plane .",
    "this turbulent diffusion is a quite efficient mechanism to dispose energy in the whole phase space , and eventually to let the equation of state behave smoothly enough .    before addressing the possible relevance to the experimental data",
    ", the following upgrades should be taken into account : first , it is necessary to incorporate the full quantum spectrum that should further accelerate the process speed .",
    "second , related to this , we should carefully deal with the renormalization and subtract the uv divergence originating from the quantum fluctuation .",
    "third , we need to turn the expansion on , which makes it even more subtle to handle the first and the second points above . in principle , as we commented , the avalanches should be associated with the particle production , which is to be reflected in the moments of the angular distribution of the produced particles . for quantitative theoretical prediction , however , we must tackle the above - mentioned tough obstacles and complete the thermalization scenario first .",
    "we believe that the qualitative finding reported in this work should be a crucial step toward solving the puzzle of the thermalization problem .",
