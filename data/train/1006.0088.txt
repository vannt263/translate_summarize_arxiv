    "entanglement is one of the most distinctive features of quantum systems .",
    "recently it has attracted much attention in view of possible applications to quantum information and quantum computation problems @xcite . in these domains ,",
    "one is often interested in creating states with large entanglement , thus raising the question how to give a quantitative measure of entanglement .",
    "pure bipartite systems ( defined below ) constitute a typical example where well - behaved entanglement quantifiers can be defined , such as the von - neumann or rnyi entropies of either subsystem @xcite , the so called concurrence for two - qubit systems  @xcite or other entanglement monotones @xcite .",
    "introducing a source of randomness in quantum entanglement problems is the key to address _ typical _ properties of such states : in this paper we focus on _ random pure _ quantum states in bipartite systems , where many analytical results have been obtained in recent times ( see e.g. @xcite for an excellent review ) .",
    "more precisely , we consider a bipartite partition of a @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space @xmath5 as @xmath6 , where we assume without loss of generality that @xmath7 .",
    "for example , @xmath8 may be taken as a given subsystem ( say a set of spins ) and @xmath9 may represent the environment ( e.g. , a heat bath ) . take a quantum state @xmath10 of the composite system and let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be two complete basis of @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "the state @xmath10 can then be expanded as a linear combination @xmath15 s form the entries of a rectangular @xmath16 matrix @xmath17 .",
    "possible features of @xmath10 we are considering here are the following :    * * entanglement : * we say that @xmath10 is an entangled state if it _ can not _ be expressed as a direct product of two states belonging to the two subsystems @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in other words , in order for @xmath10 to be _ fully unentangled _ , the coefficients @xmath18 must have the product form @xmath19 for all @xmath20 and @xmath21 in a certain basis . in this case , the state @xmath22 and @xmath23 belonging respectively to the two subsystems @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "* * randomness : * suppose that the expansion coefficients @xmath18 are random variables drawn from a certain probability distribution . in this case , we say that @xmath10 is a _",
    "random _ state , and here we focus on the simplest and most common case where @xmath18 s are independent and identically distributed ( real or complex ) gaussian variables . * * purity : * the density matrix of the composite system is simply given by @xmath24 with the constraint @xmath25=1 $ ] , or equivalently @xmath26 . note that the composite system may instead be in a statistically _ mixed _ state , with a density matrix of the form = _ k p_k |_k _ k| , [ dmmixed ] where @xmath27 s are the pure states of the composite system and @xmath28 are the probabilities that the composite system is in the @xmath29-th pure state , with @xmath30 .",
    "we will not consider this case here , and we refer to @xcite and references therein for recent results on mixed states .",

    "we normalize the pure state @xmath10 to unity so that @xmath25=1 $ ] .    tracing out the environmental degrees of freedom ( i.e. , those of subsystem @xmath9 ) leads to the definition of the _ reduced _ density matrix @xmath36 $ ] : _ a = tr_b[]=_=1^m ^b||^b .",

    "i=1^n    and the normalization condition @xmath26 , or equivalently @xmath25=1 $ ] , imposes a constraint on the eigenvalues , @xmath50 .",
    "it is useful to remark that while each individual state @xmath51 in the schmidt decomposition in eq .",
    "( [ sch1 ] ) is unentangled , their linear combination @xmath10 , in general , is entangled , and therefore the state @xmath10 can not , in general , be written as a direct product @xmath52 of two states of the respective subsystems .",
    "knowledge of the eigenvalues @xmath53 of the matrix @xmath43 is essential in providing information about how entangled a pure state is .",
    "typical entanglement quantifiers include the rnyi entropy of order @xmath54 @xmath55\\ ] ] which converges to the von neumann entropy @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "the rnyi and von neumann entropies attain their minimum value @xmath58 when one of the eigenvalues reaches its maximum value @xmath32 and all the others are zero , which corresponds to completely unentangled states , while they attain their maximum value @xmath59 in the situation where all eigenvalues are equal ( @xmath60 for all @xmath20 ) . in this case , all the states in the schmidt decomposition ( [ sch1 ] ) are equally present and the state @xmath61 is maximally entangled .",

    "this state is called random if the coefficients are drawn from an underlying gaussian distribution ( real or complex ) @xmath63\\propto \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\beta}{2 } { \\rm tr}(\\mathcal{x}^{\\dagger } \\mathcal{x})\\right]$ ] where the dyson index @xmath64 corresponds respectively to real and complex @xmath17 matrices .",
    "while generally @xmath65 are complex , _ real _ coefficients are important for systems enjoying a time - reversal ( or any anti - unitary ) symmetry . in these cases , it is known that the eigenfunctions can be chosen to be real , and the corresponding ensembles are the orthogonal ones @xmath2 .",
    "exact results for the statistics of random orthogonal states are very scarce @xcite .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to fill this gap and to present exact results for the average density of schmidt eigenvalues ( one - point function ) and the average rnyi entropy , valid for arbitrary dimensions @xmath3 of the corresponding hilbert space partitions .",

    "later , the same result was shown to hold for the @xmath71 case  @xcite . in the same paper ,",
    "page also conjectured from numerical experiments that the average von neumann entropy for _ finite _ @xmath67 and @xmath72 should read @xmath73 a result that was independently proven by many researchers soon after @xcite also in a non - extensive setting @xcite . recently",
    ", many efforts have been directed towards the study of other statistical quantities for finite @xmath74 , and _ full distributions _ of interesting observables .",

    "another jpd of eigenvalues which is closely related to ( [ jpddelta ] ) is from the wishart - laguerre ensemble of random matrices @xcite of the form @xmath86 , where @xmath17 is a gaussian @xmath87 matrix with real or complex entries .",
