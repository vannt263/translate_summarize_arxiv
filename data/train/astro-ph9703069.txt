    "the discovery of high - energy @xmath0-radiation from extragalactic compact objects has motivated many authors to consider the effects of @xmath0-ray absorption by @xmath0-@xmath0 pair production , eventually inducing pair cascades .",

    "these usually rely on the high - energy photon having much higher energy than the soft photons and thus dominating the energy input and determining the direction of motion of the center - of - momentum frame of the produced pairs .",

    "@xmath1 , it is in very good agreement with the exact result , but its evaluation is even more time - consuming than using the latter .",
    "for this reason , we will not consider it in detail , but concentrate on approximations which really yield simpler expressions than the exact one .",
    "probably the simplest expression for the pair spectrum injected by @xmath0-rays interacting with a power - law of energy spectral index @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) is based on the assumption @xmath1 and on the well - known fact that photons of energy @xmath71 interact most efficiently with photons of energy @xmath72 which motivates the approximation for the @xmath0-@xmath0 opacity of gould & schrder ( 1967 ) using a @xmath68 function approximation for the cross section , @xmath73 since in this approach pair production takes place only near the pair production threshold ( @xmath74 ) , the produced pairs have energies @xmath75 ( bonometto & rees 1971 ) .",
    "the resulting pair injection spectrum is therefore    @xmath76    ( e. g. lightman & zdziarski 1987 ) where @xmath77 ( which , of course , reduces to @xmath78 for @xmath79 ) and @xmath80 is a numerical factor , depending only on the spectral index of the soft photon distribution .",
    "this approximation yields useful results , if the power - law photon spectra extend over a sufficiently wide range ( @xmath81 ) and if for every high - energy photon of energy @xmath71 there is a soft photon of energy @xmath72 .",
    "else , the injection spectrum calculated with eq .",
    "( 30 ) cuts off at the inverse of the respective cutoff of the soft photon spectrum , seriously underpredicting the injection of pairs of higher or lower energy , respectively , where the injection spectrum declines smoothly .",
    "nevertheless , these pairs can still carry a significant fraction of the injected power .",
    "( 30 ) fails also to describe the injection of low - energetic pairs in case of a high lower cut - off of the @xmath0-ray spectrum even if soft photons of energy @xmath82 are present .",
    "for example , in the case of the interaction of a power - law spectrum extending from @xmath83 ",
    "@xmath84 with a soft power - law spectrum extending from @xmath85  @xmath86 eq .",
    "( 30 ) overpredicts the injection of pairs slightly above @xmath87 by an order of magnitude and cuts off below this energy .",
    "a similar problem arises at the high - energy end of the injection spectrum .",
    "an example for this fact is shown in fig .",
    "2 . in contrast ,",
    "the approximation ( 30 ) can well be used to describe the injection of pairs at all energies if both photon fields extend up to ( and down to , respectively ) @xmath88 . for more general soft photon distributions which are different from a power - law ( e. g. a thermal spectrum ) the analogous @xmath68-function approximation",
    "has first been introduced by kazanas ( 1984 ) .      using the full cross section for @xmath0-@xmath0 pair production as given by jauch & rohrlich ( 1959 ) instead of the @xmath68-function approximation adopted in eq .",
    "( 30 ) does not reduce the limitations of this power - law approach significantly , but other soft photon distributions can be treated more successfully with this approximation which in the limit @xmath1 reads    @xmath89    where @xmath90 and the limits @xmath91 are given by eqs .",
    "( 24 ) and ( 25 ) . here",
    ", we have assumed that the produced electron and positron have energy @xmath92 .",
    "this approach works equally well for power - law photon fields , but in contrast to eq .",
    "( 30 ) , it tends to underpredict the injection of low - energetic pairs .",
    "the same is true for the interaction of @xmath0-ray photon fields with thermal soft photon fields where the high - energy tail of the injection spectrum is described very accurately ( a few  % error ) by eq .",
    "the accuracy of this approximation improves with decreasing lower cut - off of the @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "e. g. , the injection due to a power - law @xmath0-ray spectrum from @xmath93  @xmath84 interacting with a thermal spectrum of normalized termpature @xmath94 is described by eq .",
    "( 31 ) with a deviation of less than 30  % from the exact result down to @xmath95 . for @xmath96 ,",
    "the deviation was much less than 10  % .",
    "we show an example for the latter situation in fig .",
    "3 .      a very useful approximation to the pair injection spectrum for all shapes of the soft photon spectrum under the condition @xmath97 has been found by aharonian et al . ( 1983 ) .",
    "they use a different representation of the pair production cross section and end up with a one - dimensional integral over @xmath98 which is equivalent to our @xmath8 integration in eq .",
    "they solve this integration analytically after simplifying the integrand and the integration limits according to the assumptions mentioned above .",
    "the resulting injection spectrum is    @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 it describes the power - law tail of the pair spectrum injected by power - law @xmath0-ray photon fields perfectly and is much more accurate to the injection of low - energy pairs .",
    "interaction with a power - law soft photon field is reproduced within errors of only a few  % .",
    "even if as well the @xmath0-ray as the soft photon spectrum extend to @xmath102 , the error at @xmath95 increases only to @xmath103 10  % .",
    "problems with this approximation arise if the soft photon spectrum extends up to @xmath104 , but the @xmath0-ray spectrum has a lower cut - off @xmath105 . in this case",
    ", the injection of low - energetic pairs is seriously overpredicted by eq .",
    "( 32 ) . for power - law soft photon fields , the integration over @xmath106 in eq .",

    "his equation ( b8 ) ( multiplying with the total absorption coefficient @xmath107 by which the total injection rate had been normalized to 1 ) is in perfect agreement with the numerical results according to eq .",
    "( 32 ) .",
    "the interaction of power - law @xmath0-ray spectra with thermal soft photon fields is generally described within an error of a few % at all electron / positron energies if the soft photon temperature is @xmath108 , even if the @xmath0-ray spectrum extends down to @xmath109 .",

    "we find that all the statements on soft photon or @xmath0-ray power - law spectra made above are only very weakly dependent on the respective spectral index .",
