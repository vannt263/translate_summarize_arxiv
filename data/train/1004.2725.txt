    "one of the great successes of equilibrium statistical mechanics is the classification of critical phenomena into universality classes .",
    "these are characterized by sets of critical exponents which describe the system long range physics in the critical point .",
    "it is precisely the infrared behavior , which is independent of the microscopic details of the particular system , which lies at the basis of universality .",
    "the numerical values of the critical exponents can be calculated exactly in a number of fortunate cases , otherwise they have to be calculated approximately using some perturbative technique , like notably the renormalization group , or by means of numerical simulations . scaling and hyperscaling",
    "laws provide exact relations among critical exponents and consequently both are a deep expression of the physics and provide a useful calculational tool .",
    "nonequilibrium statistical mechanics has been built in many situations as an extension of its successful equilibrium counterpart .",
    "the classification in terms of universality classes and the tools for computing critical exponents have been adapted to systems out of equilibrium , such as absorbing state transitions  @xcite and stochastic growth  @xcite .",
    "this last field is sometimes regarded as paradigmatic within nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the reason for this is the ubiquity of certain universality classes which were originally discovered in this context and were subsequently found in different areas of physics .",
    "a particularly relevant example of this is the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation  @xcite , which scaling behavior has been related to phenomena as diverse as far from equilibrium growth , turbulence and directed polymers .",
    "the kpz and other nonequilibrium growth equations can be characterized by three scaling exponents : the roughness exponent @xmath1 characterizing the interface morphology , the dynamic exponent @xmath2 which specifies the velocity at which correlations propagate and the growth exponent @xmath3 describing its short time dynamics  @xcite .",
    "one of the most important relations among these exponents is the scaling relation @xmath4 , which is fulfilled in a large number of cases .",
    "together with it there exist other scaling and hyperscaling relations describing fundamental characteristics of different physical situations .",
    "this work is devoted to the study of stochastic partial differential equations with a conserved drift . by this",
    "we mean that the deterministic part is conservative or , in other words , the spatial average of the deterministic part of the equation vanishes provided suitable boundary conditions are used .    in the following",
    "we will examine one of this scaling relations already found in the literature , and we will investigate its possible physical origin . in this work we concentrate on the two - dimensional situation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present some scaling relations for nonequilibrium models , in section iii we give a short geometric derivation of a family of conserved growth equations we will be interested in . section iv is devoted to the renormalization group analysis of these and other related equations . in the last two sections we discuss the possible origin of scaling relations for the different models and draw our conclusions .",
    "the kpz equation reads  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a zero mean gaussian noise which correlation is given by @xmath7 .",
    "if one performs the dilatation @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 the nonlinearity becomes scale invariant provided @xmath11 .",
    "this scaling relation is actually fulfilled by the kpz equation in any dimension and its exactness is usually attributed to its galilean invariance property  @xcite .",
    "however the role of galilean invariance was put into question in a related nonequilibrium model  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "in these works it is shown that neither galilean invariance nor extended galilean invariance contribute to vertex non - renormalization beyond the zeroth mode .",
    "also , the same scaling relation @xmath11 was found in numerical schemes  @xcite and stochastic equations  @xcite which do not explicitly fulfill the galilean invariance symmetry .",
    "together with the kpz equation , in this field one finds the sun - guo - grant ( sgg )  @xcite and villain - lai - das sarma ( vlds )  @xcite equations , which read @xmath12 where the noise @xmath13 corresponds to the sgg equation and @xmath14 to the vlds one .    in both cases",
    "the noise is a zero mean stochastic gaussian process and the respective correlations are : @xmath15 and @xmath16 for these equations the nonlinearity becomes scale invariant to the dilatation transformation provided the exponents fulfill the scaling relation @xmath17 .",
    "this relation was found to be fulfilled at one loop order renormalization group calculations and it was conjectured to be exact due to the existence of a functional galilean invariance symmetry  @xcite .",
    "however , in  @xcite , janssen showed that the mathematics leading to this symmetry was ill - posed .",
    "also , by means of a renormalization group calculation , he showed that this relation does not hold at two loops  @xcite .",
    "the correction to the scaling relation he found is however small and presumably not detectable in simulations or experiments .",
    "we also would like to mention here that this correction has not been found in the results obtained by means of other methods , such that the self - consistent expansion  @xcite , when applied to these equations  @xcite .",
    "this approximation scheme has proved itself very useful in finding exponent values in some cases in which the renormalization group fails , like for instance for the nonlocal counterpart of some stochastic growth equations  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "renormalization group analyses have been able to yield exact results for some stochastic growth equations  @xcite .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the renormalization group analysis of local equations and leave different approaches for a more comprehensive study . as will be evident in the following",
    ", this analysis has a clear interpretation in the cases under consideration .    in the next section",
    "we will show that it is possible to find models for which the scaling relation @xmath0 is exact to all orders in a renormalization group calculation .",

    "we concentrate on @xmath18 and assume the following variational approach for the dynamics @xmath19 where we have added the noise term @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a nonequilibrium potential .",

    "this phenomenology can be explained by means of a simple geometric argument .",
    "the surface gaussian curvature is given in the small gradient limit by @xmath43 , so the dynamics favors the growth of those parts with a positive gaussian curvature , which is precisely the observed effect .    as a final remark",

    "as a first step we will explain how to implement the rg analysis in our current situation .",

    "the exponents are exactly the ones found for the vlds equation at one loop order .",
    "the difference in this case is that the result is exact .",
    "we note that noise does not renormalize at any order in the loop expansion yielding the exactness of eq .",
    "( [ rgf2 ] ) .",
    "this is a well known fact due to the conserved character of the drift of the stochastic growth equation . in the present case , eq .",
    "( [ rgf3 ] ) is exact too due to the fact that the vertex does not renormalize at any order in the loop expansion .",
    "all diagrams contributing to vertex renormalization at any order are irrelevant in exactly the same way we have shown herein for the one loop order diagrams .    as we have seen , the exactness of the scaling relation @xmath87 holds in this case .",
    "the current situation is genuinely different from the one concerning both sgg and vlds equations . in that case",

    "this dependence is translated to the flow equations .",
    "this leads to a perfectly valid result whenever the resulting exponents are independent of this angle , see  @xcite .",
    "however , in the general case , some dependence on this angle may arise .",
    "the presence of this angle in the rg flow equations signals the generation of an integral operator in the stochastic growth equation when its coefficients become renormalized .",
    "this consequently leads to a more complicated mathematical treatment , as it implies the necessity of restarting the rg procedure including the newly generated operators . in order to avoid this , the symmetric form eq .",
    "( [ vertex ] ) must be used .",
    "we discuss in appendix  [ appasymm ] the different results which may arise from the rg analysis employing asymmetric vertex forms .",

    "our goal is getting a deeper understanding of the properties of the nonlinearity we have considered so far or variants of it . in particular , we will show that vertex non - renormalization is present in those cases in which noise renormalization is present .",

    "note that vertex non - renormalization is again present and exact , while the noise is renormalized at one loop order .",
    "this result , noise renormalization in a conserved model , was already found in the literature for this kind of noise and a different drift  @xcite .",

    "our last example is the following equation @xmath110 where the white and gaussian noise is characterized by the moments eq .",
    "( [ mnoisefour ] ) and  ( [ cnoisefour ] ) .",
    "we found this stochastic differential equation specially interesting because its rg analysis is meaningless as neither propagator , nor noise , nor vertex renormalize at any order in this case .",
    "so a different technique should be employed for this kind of model .",
    "one possibility would be the use of self - consistent expansions  @xcite as we mentioned in the introduction , but we have not explored this possibility yet .",
    "we also note that , due to the high order of differentiation in every term of this equation , its numerical analysis should be a hard task too .",
    "we now examine the physical origin of scaling relations .",
    "the exactness of the relation @xmath111 in all our equations can be traced back to expansion  ( [ expansion ] ) .",

    "accordingly , the exactness of this scaling relation indicates that the nonlinearity totally dominates over surface diffusion in the large scale . considering the full eq .",
    "( [ monge ] ) with @xmath112 we find , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) , that the laplacian dominates .",
    "so expansion  ( [ expansion ] ) provides a simple geometric interpretation of the renormalization group results and the exactness of this scaling relation .",
    "the exactness of the exponents for the ssg and vlds universality classes , found in our equations , was due to noise and vertex non - renormalization .",
    "noise non - renormalization is a common fact , and its origin is in the conserved character of the drift , which has been shown in previous works  @xcite .",
    "the case of the vertex is new .",
    "indeed , the vertex structure @xmath113 implies that all contributions to the renormalization of the vertex are @xmath82 , while the vertex renormalizes at @xmath74 .",
    "the concrete calculations have been carried out in sec .",
    "[ method ] .",
    "in other words , the vertex is not renormalized because all the generated feynman diagrams correspond to irrelevant contributions .",
    "this is easily seen by noting that in the renormalization group calculation the vertex contributions result from integrating against measure  ( [ measure ] ) .",
    "the procedure is identical to the one carried out for the kpz equation  @xcite _ mutatis mutandis_. any possible contributions to the renormalized coefficients come from integrands that are exactly @xmath114 , as higher order contributions are irrelevant .",
    "it is immediate realizing that the @xmath114 contribution of measure  ( [ measure ] ) is identically zero . in consequence , noise and vertex",
    "do not renormalize at any order in the loop expansion .",
    "this is in contrast to what happened to the sgg and vlds equations , for which the vertex one loop diagrams were relevant but they cancelled each other out  @xcite .    while the renormalization group is a perturbative technique which may allow access to the critical exponents , it is also possible to unveil ( at least part of ) the critical behavior by means of finding the stationary probability distribution of a given langevin equation .",
    "this approach has being successfully exploited in the past  @xcite , mainly ( but not only  @xcite ) in those cases in which the stationary state is gaussian . in our case",
    "it is possible as well , as was shown in  @xcite , to formally find the exact stationary probability density corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ ssgvldsma ] ) using its gradient flow structure @xmath115= -\\int \\left [ \\lambda \\ , h_{x } h_{y } h_{xy } - \\frac{\\nu}{2 } ( \\nabla^2 h)^2 \\right ] dx \\ , dy.\\ ] ] then the probability density reads @xmath116 dx \\ , dy \\right\\},\\ ] ] and it is evidently not gaussian .",
    "this distribution is of course not normalizable due to the presence of the cubic term , and consequently this expression is purely formal .",
    "its form suggests that the interface profile could be initially dominated by the quadratic term , and after some transient the noise could drive the interface out of this potential well .",
    "then for long times the cubic term would dominate , as the dynamics would be separated from the initial gaussian behavior by the nonlinearity .",
    "this simple picture , derived from the formal stationary probability distribution , agrees with the results of the renormalization group analysis .",
    "in this work we have shown that the scaling relation @xmath117 , which originates in the vertex non - renormalization and which is inexact in the renormalization group sense for both ssg and vlds equations , becomes exact in the case of eq .",
    "( [ mampere ] ) with both conserved and non - conserved noises . the physical origin of this scaling relation is not the existence of a symmetry ( such as a functional galilean invariance ) but the existence of the geometric principle described by eqs .",

    "therein we have found that vertex non - renormalization is exact for the considered nonlinearity independently of whether noise is renormalized or not .",
    "the validity of these results extends to all examined models , except the last one . in that case",
    ", the higher order of differentiation precludes the access to the critical behavior by means of the employment of the rg technique , as we have shown .",
    "we have focused on conserved surface growth but the existence of scaling laws happens as well in non - conserved cases .",
    "notably the kpz equation obeys the relation @xmath118 .",
    "although this scaling relation has been traditionally attributed to the existence of a galilean invariance in the equation , recent numerical work suggests that it is possible to find discrete schemes which do not obey this symmetry and are still able to reproduce the kpz universality class  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the existence of a geometric principle , akin to the one discussed here , could be a possible alternative explanation .",

    "as mentioned in section  [ method ] using asymmetric vertex forms leads to the explicit appearance of the polar angle in fourier space .",
    "this fact signals the generation of new operators and requires the employment of a more sophisticated mathematical treatment that will be outlined at the end of this appendix .",
    "the aim of this appendix is showing that , nevertheless , it is possible to formally proceed with the calculations ignoring the presence of this angle and still find the good result . sometimes this is possible , sometimes it is not .",
    "herein we exemplify these different possibilities .",
    "we consider the equation @xmath119 first of all we shall concentrate on the non - conserved noise case @xmath120 .",
    "we employ the following asymmetric vertex form @xmath121 \\\\ \\times \\ , h ( \\vec{k}-\\vec{q},\\omega-\\omega ) \\ , h(\\vec{q},\\omega ) \\ , \\frac{d\\omega \\ , d\\vec{q}}{(2 \\pi)^3 } , \\label{fourierampere}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 @xmath49 is the fourier transformed white noise , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( the same holds for @xmath52 ) .",
    "the renormalized coefficients satisfy the rg flow equations , which at one loop order are given by @xmath122 , \\\\",
    "\\frac{d d}{d\\ell } & = & d \\left [ z-2 - 2\\alpha \\right ] , \\\\ \\frac{d \\lambda}{d\\ell } & = & \\lambda \\left [ z+\\alpha -4 \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the variable @xmath90 is the polar angle in fourier space . an alternative way of thinking about this angle is through the relation @xmath123 where @xmath124 denotes the spatial fourier transform .",
    "the values of the exponents are independent of this angle and take the correct values @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "now we move to the case of conserved noise , i. e. to the model @xmath127 repeating the dynamic renormalization group calculations we arrive at the flow equations for the effective parameters @xmath122 , \\\\",
    "\\frac{d d}{d\\ell } & = & d \\left [ z-4 - 2\\alpha + \\frac{d \\lambda^2}{64 \\pi \\nu^3 } \\right ] , \\\\ \\frac{d \\lambda}{d\\ell } & = & \\lambda \\left [ z+\\alpha-4 \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the resulting exponents are independent of @xmath90 and consequently they are the correct ones : @xmath128 and @xmath97 .",
    "note however that the noise renormalization that arises in this case should be interpreted as a spurious result since it does not appear in the case of a symmetric vertex form , cf .",
    "eqs  ( [ rgf11])-([rgf22])-([rgf33 ] ) .",
    "now we move to the last model @xmath129 the renormalization group leads us this time to the flow equations @xmath130 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "\\label{theta3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so we find the @xmath131dependent exponents @xmath132 in this case these values have to be considered invalid because it is not possible to recover the correct exponents found in the analysis performed with the symmetric vertex form from eqs .",
    "( [ alfa ] , [ zeta ] ) . indeed , averaging @xmath90 out from either eqs .",
    "( [ theta1 ] , [ theta2 ] , [ theta3 ] ) or ( [ alfa ] , [ zeta ] ) does not reproduce the actual values of the exponents @xmath96 and @xmath97 known form eqs .",
    "( [ expnab61 ] , [ expnab62 ] , [ expnab63 ] ) .",
    "the correct way to proceed now would be deriving the stochastic growth equation with renormalized coefficients .",
    "this leads to the appearance of new operators in the equation .",
    "an example with a fourth order equation can be found in  @xcite . in this example , contrary to ours , a new term in the equation is generated ; in our present case the differential operators become integro - differential .",
    "in fact , @xmath133 gives rise to a linear integral operator which in fourier space reduces itself to a multiplication by the factor @xmath134 of the field over which it is applied  @xcite .",
    "the resulting stochastic growth equation should be analyzed again by means of the rg technique .",
    "obviously , this is much harder than using a symmetric vertex form .    in summary",
    ", it is possible to analyze stochastic growth equations using asymmetric vertex forms .",
    "one can formally proceed , ignore the presence of polar angles in fourier space , and end up with @xmath131dependent flow equations . if the resulting exponents are independent of these angles one can conclude the calculation . if there is @xmath90 dependence in the exponents , then one has to derive the equation with the newly generated operators and restart the analysis .",
    "the overall procedure is more complicated than using a symmetric vertex form .",
    "this operator is related to the riesz transform , see e. m. stein , _ harmonic analysis : real - variable methods , orthogonality and oscillatory integrals _",
