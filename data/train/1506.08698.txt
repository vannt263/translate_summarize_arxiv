    "<S> a new class of solutions for einstein s field equations representing a static spherically symmetric anisotropic distribution of matter is obtained on the background of pseudo - spheroidal spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> we have prescribed the bounds of the model parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the basis of the elementary criteria for physical acceptability , viz . , regularity , stability and energy conditions . </S>",
    "<S> by taking the values of model parameters from the prescribed bounds , we have shown that our model is compatible with the observational data of a wide variety of compact stars like 4u 1820 - 30 , psr j1903 + 327 , 4u 1608 - 52 , vela x-1 , psr j1614 - 2230 , smc x-4 and cen x-3 . </S>"
