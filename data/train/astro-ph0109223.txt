    "the knowledge of the transport properties of charged particles in turbulent magnetized plasmas is a long  standing problem , which bears directly on many astrophysical issues , such as the penetration of low - energy cosmic rays in the heliosphere  @xcite , the propagation and escape of galactic cosmic rays in and out of the interstellar magnetic field  @xcite , or even the efficiency of fermi acceleration mechanisms , in particular at shocks  @xcite .",
    "the diffusion coefficient transverse to the mean component of the magnetic field plays a particularly important role in these issues , but to date , there is no satisfactory description of perpendicular transport .",
    "some studies have built upon or tried to extend the results of the `` quasi - linear theory ''  @xcite , whose validity is limited to very low level turbulence , _ i.e. _ a turbulent component much weaker than the uniform magnetic field , and which calculates the transport coefficients by statistical averages of the displacements perturbed to first order in the inhomogenous field .",
    "other studies have appealed to phenomenological approximations such as the bohm estimate for the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 , which corresponds to the assumption that the mean free path for scattering @xmath1 of a particle of velocity @xmath2 , is given by the larmor radius @xmath3 .",
    "this approximation originates from laboratory experiments which led d. bohm to the empirical formula @xmath4 for a plasma with temperature @xmath5 .",
    "a theoretical derivation of this formula was proposed later by taylor and mcnamara  @xcite , and then extended to relativistic particles  @xcite , but no theory of bohm diffusion ( relativistic or not ) in magnetic irregularities has been derived _",
    "stricto - sensu _ so far .",
    "therefore it appears that important physical and astrophysical issues are yet to be answered :    * how do the transport properties change when the level of magnetic turbulence is increased ?",
    "what are the transport properties when the mean field vanishes ?",
    "notably , what is the relevance of the bohm scaling ? * even for low level turbulence , transverse space diffusion is not well known .",
    "it nevertheless plays a crucial role in the confinement of cosmic rays in galaxies or other extragalactic objects ( notably radio - galaxies jets ) .",
    "its magnitude is also of direct relevance to the performance of fermi acceleration at perpendicular shocks . *",
    "do subdiffusive and more generally anomalous diffusion regimes exist ?",
    "if yes , they are also of importance for fermi acceleration .    in order to shed light on these issues , we have performed extensive numerical experiments to determine the pitch angle scattering rate , and the parallel and perpendicular spatial diffusion coefficients for a wide range of rigidities and turbulence levels .",
    "our experiments are conducted by monte - carlo simulations in which we follow the propagation of a relativistic test particle in a stochastic magnetic field constructed from three - dimensional kolmogorov turbulence , and calculate the diffusion coefficients from the statistical correlations along the trajectory .",
    "our study is similar to the recent work of giacalone and jokipii  @xcite in which the spatial diffusion coefficients in two and three  dimensional magnetostatic turbulence were measured using monte - carlo simulations for various turbulence levels and rigidities .",
    "our study is however more extensive than that of ref .",
    "in particular we measure the diffusion coefficients in a broader range of rigidities , by studying the diffusion of particles with larmor radii larger than the coherence length , and in a broader range of turbulence levels , by going up to pure turbulence in which there is no uniform component of the magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , ref .  @xcite studies the case of lower - energy particles and smaller turbulence levels , with a turbulent magnetic field never exceeding the uniform component in strength . we also study in detail the pitch angle scattering rate , which is of central interest in applications to shock acceleration processes , and study in more detail the issue of transverse diffusion and its relation to the chaotic wandering of field lines .",
    "finally we will repeatedly compare our results to ref .",
    "@xcite where there is overlap , which is important since these numerical experiments are delicate .    among our results ,",
    "we confirm the extrapolation to high turbulence levels of the scalings predicted by the quasi - linear theory for the scattering rate and the parallel diffusion coefficient at low enough rigidity . the perpendicular diffusion coefficient is shown to follow a law which is quite different from the predictions of the quasi - linear theory at low rigidities .",
    "we argue that its behavior is compatible with chaotic wandering and diffusion of the magnetic field lines to which particles are `` attached '' . in particular , we demonstrate the chaotic behavior of the magnetic field lines and calculate the associated kolmogorov length and diffusion coefficient in terms of the turbulence level .",
    "we also show that the bohm diffusion coefficient only holds in a limited range of rigidities @xmath6 for pure turbulence , and does not exist when the mean field is non - vanishing . in this latter case the bohm value for the coefficient is only obtained at maximum pitch angle scattering , _",
    "i.e. _ for particules with larmor radius of order of the coherence scale . finally , we also found that diffusion operates even for particles whose larmor radii is larger than the coherence length , as far as we have searched in rigidity ( 1.5 decade ) . on these scales ,",
    "the scattering rate decays as expected , albeit moderately , as the power @xmath7 of the rigidity .",
    "our study is conducted with the following main simplifying assumptions :    * the magnetic field is composed of a mean homogeneous field @xmath8 and an inhomogeneous component @xmath9 : @xmath10 . *",
    "the magnetic disturbances are considered to be static .",
    "this assumption is well justified as the waves propagate with velocities of the order of the alfvn velocity @xmath11 , smaller than the velocity of particles @xmath12 ( we consider relativistic particles ) , and the electric force is thus smaller than the magnetic force by a factor @xmath13 .",
    "the first correction to the theory is the celebrated second order fermi process which can be described by diffusion in momentum space , with diffusion coefficient @xmath14 , with @xmath15 particle momentum , and @xmath16 , the angular scattering frequency , is an outcome of our study . *",
    "the magnetic perturbations are distributed according to isotropic turbulence , whose power spectrum is written in terms of fourier momentum @xmath17 as : @xmath18 for @xmath19 , zero otherwise , and @xmath20 , _",
    "i.e. _ random phases .",
    "the exponent @xmath21 characterizes the properties of the turbulence , and we will concentrate on the case @xmath22 in our numerical applications , which describes kolmogorov turbulence . the smallest turbulence wavenumber is related to the maximum scale of the turbulence @xmath23 _ via _ : @xmath24 .",
    "this largest scale also corresponds to the correlation length of the magnetic field to within a factor of order unity [ see eq.([eq_correlation ] ) ] .",
    "our notations are as follows .",
    "the quantities we will be interested in are the scattering rate @xmath25 or scattering time @xmath26 , defined as the correlation time of the pitch angle , the spatial diffusion coefficient along the mean field @xmath27 and the transverse spatial diffusion coefficient @xmath28 .",
    "these coefficients are evaluated in terms of turbulence level @xmath29 $ ] , and rigidity @xmath30 . for convenience ,",
    "the larmor radius @xmath31 is defined with respect to the total magnetic field : @xmath32 for a particle with energy @xmath33 and charge @xmath34 .",
    "the larmor pulsation of a particle of energy @xmath33 is defined , for convenience , as @xmath35 , and the larmor time @xmath36 .",
    "we define the scattering function as @xmath37 .",
    "when useful , we will denote by @xmath38 the larmor pulsation in the mean field .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    ", we recall the relation between spatial diffusion and the scattering off magnetic disturbances and present the numerical method . in section 3",
    ", we present our numerical results and discuss the issue of transverse diffusion and the measurement of magnetic chaos characteristics . a discussion with direct astrophysical consequences of our results is given in section 5 , and conclusions are offered in section 6 .",
    "finally , in appendix  a , we propose a theoretical interpretation of the regimes of diffusion observed , and in particular of the existence of diffusion for larmor radii larger than the maximum scale of turbulence .",
    "high energy particles interact with cosmic matter mostly through scattering on the magnetic field which is more or less frozen in the medium .",
    "the interaction is elastic in the frame of a magnetic disturbance and it can be considered as elastic in the plasma rest frame to lowest order in @xmath39 , if the disturbance propagates at small enough velocity @xmath40 . with respect to a given direction , chosen as that of the uniform component of the magnetic field if this",
    "latter is non - vanishing , the pitch angle of the particle changes almost randomly if the magnetic field is sufficiently disorganized ( this will be made more precise further on ) .",
    "therefore the position of the particle changes according to a random walk on a time scale which is longer than the coherence time of the pitch angle cosine , and pitch angle scattering is thus responsible for the diffusion of particles .",
    "however it is generally believed that transverse diffusion may also occur through wandering of the magnetic field lines . in this picture",
    ", the transverse velocity of the particle changes through resonant diffusion as before while the guiding center of the approximate helical motion wanders with the magnetic field line to which it is attached , and performs a random walk in the transverse direction .",
    "these notions will be quantified in the forthcoming sections .",
    "our main objective here is indeed to quantify these various contributions to the process of diffusion .",
    "we define the pitch angle @xmath41 with respect to the mean field direction when it exists , otherwise the direction can be arbitrarily chosen .",
    "the convenient random function is the pitch angle cosine : @xmath42 , and @xmath41 is a function of time . since we assume a static spectrum of magnetic perturbations , the auto - correlation function of @xmath43 will become stationary in the large time limit .",
    "it can then be defined as :    @xmath44    where the average can be performed in three different ways . in the original quasi - linear theory , this average",
    "is taken over the phases of the magnetic disturbances . in the theory of chaos",
    ", the average is performed over the phase space subset of chaotic motions . in practice , and this is what we will use in the numerical experiment , we assume ergodicity and make temporal average",
    ". our procedure of calculating averages is explicited further below .",
    "the scattering time @xmath45 can then be defined as the coherence time of the pitch angle cosine : @xmath46 in particular , if the auto - correlation function falls off exponentially @xmath47 then @xmath48 . turning to the spatial diffusion coefficient @xmath27 ,",
    "let @xmath49 be the coordinate of a particle along the mean field direction .",
    "then @xmath50 with a constant velocity @xmath2 ( in our case @xmath51 ) , since energy is conserved .",
    "consider now a random variation @xmath52 of @xmath49 during the time interval @xmath53 supposed to be larger than the scattering time @xmath45 .",
    "one has @xmath54 , and @xmath55    beyond the scattering time @xmath45 , if the stationary random process @xmath43 explores uniformly the interval @xmath56 , the space diffusion coefficient parallel to the mean field stems straightforwardly from its definition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dxpc ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) : @xmath57 here as well the average can be made according to one of the three ways explained above .",
    "the main goal of the computation is then to determine the dependence of @xmath45 , or the scattering function @xmath58 , in terms of the rigidity @xmath59 and the turbulence level @xmath60 .",
    "the theoretical result is known in the regime of weak turbulence  @xcite , if the correlation time @xmath61 of the force suffered by the particle is much smaller than the scattering time @xmath45 . to make it more precise , particles undergo resonances with the mhd modes such that @xmath62 .",
    "the correlation time is related to the width of the resonance in the mode spectrum , such that : @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the spectrum width , in the parallel direction . since @xmath65 , @xmath66 is equivalent to @xmath67 . in this case",
    "the memory of the initial pitch angle can even be kept and the scattering function @xmath68 .",
    "however diffusion coefficients calculated on timescales larger than @xmath45 must be averaged over @xmath69 .",
    "due to rotation invariance around the mean field direction , there is a single transverse diffusion coefficient ( when diffusion occurs ) , given by :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 denotes the displacement perpendicular to the mean field during the time interval @xmath53 . in weak turbulence theory ( @xmath72 ) ,",
    "the gyro - phase @xmath73 of the particle is only weakly perturbed by the disorganized component of the field and @xmath74 , where the gyro - pulsation @xmath38 is determined with respect to the mean field .",
    "the transverse velocity can be approximated by : @xmath75 , \\label{eq : vperp}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 denotes the charge of the particle , and we implicitly assumed the mean field to lie along the direction @xmath77 .",
    "the pitch angle sine @xmath78 varies on the timescale @xmath45 , which is much longer than the larmor time in the weak turbulence regime .",
    "the time correlation function of the pitch angle is obviously the same as that of the cosines since @xmath79 , hence @xmath80 .",
    "therefore the transverse diffusion coefficient reads :    @xmath81    assuming that the correlation function @xmath82 decays exponentially on the characteristic time @xmath45 , one finally obtains a result similar to the so - called classical diffusion that reads    @xmath83    this transverse diffusion based on pitch angle scattering only leads to the ratio @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the mean free path of a particle along the mean magnetic field .",
    "this relation can also be obtained by treating the magnetic disturbances as hard sphere scattering centers with weak or strong turbulence .",
    "it is also a result of the study of ref .",
    "@xcite , which estimate phenomenological diffusion coefficients by using well - motivated assumptions for the velocity auto - correlation functions of the particle orbit .",
    "finally , since @xmath86 in the weak turbulence regime , one expects @xmath87 when @xmath88 .",
    "however the transverse diffusion may turn out to be larger than predicted by quasi - linear theory , even for moderate turbulence .",
    "in particular note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : dpar ] ) for the parallel diffusion coefficient rests on the sole assumption that @xmath82 vanishes on timescales longer than @xmath45 , while the quasi - linear result for the transverse diffusion coefficient , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddp ] ) , assumes that the particle orbit is only weakly perturbed and the timescale of variation of the pitch angle is much longer than the larmor time , _",
    "i.e. _ , that the level of turbulence @xmath88 .",
    "we refer to this result as a prediction of quasi - linear theory ; it neglects the diffusion of the guide center carrying field line and the associated process of chaotic magnetic diffusion which has been analysed by jokipii and parker  @xcite , and to which we will come back in the following section .",
    "finally in all cases one should obtain @xmath89 when @xmath90 , since the mean field vanishes in this limit and there is no prefered direction anymore .      in order to evaluate the transport coefficients ,",
    "we follow the propagation of particles in stochastic magnetic fields by integrating the standard equation of motion ( lorentz force ) , and measure the statistical quantities of interest to us , namely @xmath91 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , using the estimators defined respectively in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tau]),([eq : dpar]),([eq : ddp ] ) . strictly speaking",
    ", the averages contained in these expressions should be taken over the phases of the magnetic inhomogeneities . in practice",
    "however , one may as well take these averages as follows . for a given @xmath53 [ using the notations of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dpar]),([eq : ddp ] ) ] , a time @xmath92 is picked at random over the trajectory , and the correlation between the positions at times @xmath92 and @xmath93 is recorded ; this operation is repeated many times and the average is kept .",
    "this latter is then further averaged over a population of particles with random initial positions , and then over an ensemble of magnetic field realizations with random phases . in practice , we propagate @xmath94 particles , measure the correlations at @xmath95 different times along the trajectory of each particle , and use a few magnetic realizations .",
    "this procedure allows to reach a sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio in the simulation for a moderate computer time , as indeed setting up the magnetic field and propagating a particle is much more costly than taking averages along the trajectory .    in principle",
    "one could as well take the average @xmath96 as the variance of the displacement at time @xmath53 over a population of particles originally concentrated at the origin , as in ref .",
    "however this method requires to follow the trajectory of a large number of particles @xmath97 in order to achieve a reasonable signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the method we employ , which measures the correlations along the trajectory of each particle , before averaging over a population of particles , is less costly in computer time ( but requires much more memory ) .",
    "nevertheless , we also checked ( and found ) that the method which measures the variance of the displacement gave results in agreement with our method within the error attached to the small number of particles propagated .",
    "the magnetic field can be constructed in two different ways which both present pros and cons .",
    "the first method uses fast - fourier transform ( fft ) algorithms to set up the magnetic field on a discrete grid in configuration space , starting from the magnetic field defined through its power spectrum in fourier space , _ i.e. _ :    @xmath98           .",
    "\\label{eq : b_fft}\\ ] ]    in this equation , @xmath99 is the tri - dimensional wavenumber vector , with integer coordinates taking values between @xmath100 and @xmath101 , @xmath102 is a unit vector orthogonal to @xmath99 ( this ensures @xmath103 ) , @xmath104 is the amplitude of the field component , and is defined such that @xmath105 and @xmath106 , where the average concerns the phases of the magnetic field .",
    "finally , @xmath107 is a numerical prefactor which ensures the correct normalization of the inhomogenous magnetic component with respect to the mean field , by using the following ergodic approximation to @xmath108 :    @xmath109    and as before @xmath110 . in practice ,",
    "the field components are calculated at each vertex @xmath111 of a discrete grid in configuration space beforehand .",
    "the boundary conditions are periodic with period @xmath23 , and the fundamental cubic cell size is @xmath112 , where @xmath113 represents the number of wavenumber modes along one direction .",
    "one thus has : @xmath114 , where the factor 2 comes from the fact that one must consider both negative and positive @xmath17-modes to respect the hermiticity of @xmath115 . in our simulation",
    ", we typically use @xmath116 and in some cases @xmath117 which gives us a dynamic range of two orders of magnitude .    during the propagation of particles , it is of course necessary to know the magnetic field at any point @xmath118 for the integration of the equations of motion .",
    "our numerical code calculates the value @xmath119 either by tri - linear interpolation between the known values of the field components on the 8 vertices of the cell to which @xmath118 belongs , or by taking the value of @xmath9 at the vertex closest to @xmath118 , which amounts to assuming a constant @xmath9 in cells of size @xmath120 centered on each vertex .",
    "while the former method does not respect @xmath121 , the latter implies a discontinuous magnetic field on each cubic cell face .",
    "we will show in the following that the results obtained by these methods differ only when scales smaller than the cell size are concerned , as expected .",
    "a second algorithm for computing the magnetic field has been proposed by giacalone & jokipii  @xcite and calculates the magnetic field as a sum over plane wave modes ( we will refer to this algorithm as gj ) .",
    "the expression defining @xmath122 is very similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : b_fft ] ) above , except that @xmath99 needs not have integral coordinates anymore , as fast - fourier transform methods are not used .",
    "indeed , one does not calculate the field on a discrete grid beforehand , but its values are calculated where and when needed during the propagation directly from the sum over plane waves . also the sum is not tri - dimensional , but one - dimensional ; the wavenumbers directions are drawn at random , and the amplitude @xmath123 to account for phase space volume . in practice , it is convenient to have logarithmic spacing of the @xmath124modes between @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "one main advantage of the gj method is that there is no restriction in dynamic range due to memory usage , and consequently @xmath127 can be as large as required .",
    "however , one is limited in terms of computer usage time since it is expensive to perform the sum over the wavenumber modes at each point of the trajectory if the number of modes @xmath128 becomes significant . in practice , @xmath129 is a strict upper limit for our applications  @xcite , and even with @xmath130 the calculation is already much slower than a similar calculation with the above fft algorithm .",
    "the number of modes is important as it controls the efficiency of diffusion , since pitch angle scattering proceeds mainly through resonance of the particle momentum on the magnetic field modes . in quasi - linear theory",
    "the resonance condition reads @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the component of the wavenumber along the mean magnetic field direction .",
    "the fft and gj share a similar number of resonance modes in this limit @xmath133 .",
    "however for each resonant @xmath132 the fft algorithm has @xmath134 transverse components to be compared with one for the gj algorithm .",
    "one thus expects that at higher turbulence levels , diffusion should be more effective in the fft algorithm due to the much larger total number of modes than in the gj algorithm .",
    "furthermore , in order to preserve a correct spacing of modes in the gj algorithm , one can not indefinitely increase the dynamic range @xmath135 since @xmath128 is fixed for practical reasons , _ i.e. _ computer time .",
    "however the fft algorithm suffers from other limitations ( apart from the limitation in dynamic range ) : the interpolation of @xmath9 on scales smaller than the cell size , and the periodicity on the scale @xmath23 .",
    "these limitations are not present in the gj algorithm , and imply that the results of the fft method obtained for larmor radii much smaller than the cell size , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath136 , or much bigger than the periodicity scale , @xmath137 , can not be trusted , since these regimes are likely to be dominated by systematic effects related to the discreteness or to the periodicity .",
    "overall both methods appear complementary to each other , and we use them in turn to compare and discuss the robustness of our numerical results with respect to the assumptions made .",

    "( [ fig : corr ] ) _ vs _ time interval @xmath150 for various levels of turbulence @xmath60 .",
    "two bumps are observed at one and two larmor periods .",
    "these bumps are observed as long as the regular magnetic field @xmath151 exists . since the decorrelation times for @xmath152 are larger than one larmor period , the larmor motions are not completely disorganized and contribute to the correlation function with some harmonics generated by nonlinearities .",
    "the inflexion of the function indicates that it behaves as @xmath153 as @xmath154 and then decreases exponentially in @xmath155 as @xmath156 .",

    "this figure shows several interesting features which deserve further comments .",
    "first of all , one finds that both methods for calculating the magnetic field , _ i.e. _ fft and gj , agree well within the range of validity of the former method , namely for @xmath158 , where @xmath159 , and @xmath160 .",
    "these two limiting rigidities correspond to larmor radii of order of the cell size and of the maximum scale of turbulence respectively , and result from the discreteness and periodicity of the magnetic field grid , as explained in section  [ subsec.nuco ] .",

    "a , we provide a first theoretical explanation of this result by expansion of the particle trajectory in the random displacement and statistical averaging of a non - perturbative resummation of an infinity of graphs of correlations along the trajectory .    for @xmath168 and @xmath169 one notes a flattening of the scattering function with recovery of the exponent @xmath148 power law at smaller rigidities .",
    "this flattening is definitely present for @xmath146 ( no mean component of the magnetic field ) , and correspond to the phenomenological bohm diffusion regime , as will be seen further below ; however , it only extends over slightly less than a decade in rigidity for @xmath170 , even though for that simulation the dynamic range was very large @xmath171 . at maximum pitch angle scattering ,",

    "i.e. _ the pitch angle scattering time @xmath45 is of order 2 larmor times @xmath175 .",
    "it should be noted that we define the rigidity with respect to the maximum scale of turbulence , which strictly speaking does not coincide with the coherence scale @xmath176 of the turbulent magnetic field . in effect , the spatial correlation function of the turbulent component is defined as @xmath177 with @xmath178 the power spectrum .",

    "the problem can be stated as follows .",

    "the intermediate regime , for @xmath223 scattering times , with @xmath243 , leads to sub - diffusive motion ( compound diffusion ) , with @xmath244 , see for instance ref .",

    "we find , in agreement with the above relation , that @xmath204 is independent of @xmath59 for @xmath163 , and that @xmath256 provides a good fit to the scaling observed at @xmath152 .",

    "in this section , we offer revised estimates of the maximal energy that can be attained by fermi acceleration mechanisms by comparing the acceleration time and the time of escape of cosmic rays outside of the accelerating region using the results obtained in the previous section . we first consider the case of galactic supernovae remnants ( snr ) and so - called superbubbles , and then turn to the case of jets in extragalactic sources .",
    "the lagging questions of the production of cosmic rays in supernovae remnants has been recently reviewed in ref .",
    "one of the major problems in accounting for the observational data is that the maximum energy achieved by the fermi process in the snr shock is well below the so - called `` knee''-range @xmath260ev .",
    "if one uses the bohm approximation to the diffusion coefficient , there is hope to reach the knee energy with sufficient efficiency to expect significant @xmath261-ray emission resulting from @xmath262 decay generated by pp - collisions .",
    "the lack of detection of these gamma - rays  @xcite or their marginal detection at best , ruined these optimistic assumptions .",
    "the fermi acceleration at a shock of velocity @xmath263 is characterized by an acceleration timescale @xmath264 . in most of the shock region , @xmath265 hence @xmath266 , where @xmath267 .",
    "the maximum energy is limited by the age of the supernovae remnants , and one thus obtains @xmath268 this result differs from @xcite only by the factor @xmath269 .",
    "this factor is close to unity when the bohm scaling applies ; but , as we have found in section  [ subsec.nure ] , in fact @xmath270 . strictly speaking this",
    "scaling is valid for kolmogorov turbulence , and one expects the turbulent magnetic field downstream to differ from isotropic three - dimensional kolmogorov , but the above scaling serves well for order of magnitude estimates .",
    "moreover @xmath271 for larmor radii smaller than turbulence correlation length which could be the case even for the most energetic particles .",
    "the bohm approximation thus appears very optimistic .",
    "super - bubbles correspond to huge cavities created by @xmath272 snr shock waves built around massive stars associations .",
    "the size of these regions can be a sizable fraction of the galaxy disk thickness @xmath273pc ) . in effect , a typical super - bubble radius can be estimated as  @xcite    @xmath274    where @xmath275 measures the mechanical luminosity of the ob - stars association , @xmath276 the particle density of the surrounding interstellar medium @xmath277@xmath278 , and @xmath279 is the super - bubble lifetime in units of myr .",
    "the bubble plasma is more dilute than the interstellar medium by at least two orders of magnitude and thus the alfvn velocity is much greater .",
    "this density reads  @xcite @xmath280 where @xmath281 is a number of order unity  @xcite .",
    "the bubble is traversed by many shock fronts propagating with velocity of order or greater than the alfvn velocity ; a second order type of fermi acceleration is thus at work .",
    "its acceleration time scale is given by @xmath282 .",
    "the maximal energy is limited by escape of the particles , which is governed by the diffusion across the galaxy disk thickness for the most energetic . a strict lower limit to the time of escape @xmath283 can be obtained by using the parallel diffusion coefficient , since @xmath284 with @xmath285 the diffusion coefficient .",
    "transverse diffusion would improve the confinement time and thus lead to a higher maximal energy ; however one should then take into account the fact that magnetic lines come out of the galaxy disk and unfold in the halo .",
    "let us consider the lower estimate : @xmath286 the maximal energy for acceleration by second order fermi process in super - bubbles then corresponds to @xmath287 , and reads    @xmath288    where we used @xmath289 .",
    "therefore the second order fermi process in super - bubbles might cover the knee range with slightly optimistic assumptions , since the magnetic field intensity can easily reach @xmath290 g in these super - bubbles , and @xmath291 .",
    "moreover , at that maximal energy the rigidity reaches unity and therefore @xmath292 , smaller but close to unity . at this point",
    "it is useful to recall that the confinement limiting energy of cosmic rays in the galaxy obtained by equating the larmor radius with the thickness @xmath293 is of order @xmath294ev .",
    "extragalactic jets emanating from active galactic nuclei have been considered as possible sources of ultra high energy cosmic rays with @xmath295ev because the confinement limit in a jet of radius @xmath296 and bulk lorentz factor @xmath297 is @xmath298 and for the powerful , strongly collimated and with terminal hot spots fr2 jets , the product @xmath299 is roughly uniform in the jet and is estimated as @xmath300 where @xmath301 is the mass of the central black hole . indeed , asymptotically , the magnetic field at the edge of the jet is dominated by its toroidal component ; therefore the product @xmath299 is governed by the current generated by the central engine along the axis .",
    "it slightly decreases along the jet , because the return current progressively establishes through wrapped lines off axis like butterfly wings  @xcite .",
    "these jets are launched if the magnetic field intensity is close to equipartition with the radiation pressure in the central region , _",
    "i.e. _ , within @xmath302 gravitational radii .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath303 within @xmath304 .",
    "thus the performance of the jets as uhe cosmic rays accelerators tightly depends on the nature of the central engine . at the base of the jet ,",
    "@xmath305 mg for @xmath306pc is a reasonable number . in the hot spots of the fr2 jets such as those of cygnus a , @xmath307 g for a region of size @xmath308kpc .",
    "thus with @xmath309 , the confinement condition in jets rules out the possibility of generating ultra - high energy cosmic rays of energies larger than @xmath310ev . in the case of fr1 jets , which are less powerful , less collimated , and without hot spots ,",
    "the limiting energy is even smaller since the product @xmath299 , although not well known , is very likely lower .    as usual",
    ", the escape of the highest energy cosmic rays is governed by diffusion across the jet and @xmath311 where we have use our previous result that perpendicular diffusion is governed by magnetic diffusion of the field line , and @xmath312 .",
    "one thus finds that indeed most high energy cosmic rays escape before reaching the end of the jet , since @xmath313 to be compared with a travel time of @xmath277myr to travel @xmath314kpc , the typical length of extragalactic jets . here",
    "as well the maximal energy for fermi acceleration is obtained by equating @xmath315 with the acceleration timescale for acceleration in shocks moving at speed @xmath316 .",
    "this gives    @xmath317    with the plausible assumption of kolmogorov turbulence , @xmath318 , we finally obtain the maximal energy as a fraction @xmath319 of the confinement energy , the estimate being weakly sensitive to the turbulence level : @xmath320    centaurus a is a well - known example of active galactic nucleus , actually the closest to us ( distance 3.4  mpc ) , which displays fr1 non relativistic jets moving at speeds @xmath321km / s .",
    "the jets have both radio and x - ray band synchrotron emission with luminosity @xmath322erg / s extending over several kpc .",
    "they have been studied in detail with high resolution interferometry  @xcite and recently with the chandra x - ray satellite  @xcite .",
    "the radio knots and the x - ray knots are identical in the inner jet .",
    "the minimum pressure magnetic field is @xmath323 g and the maximum lorentz factor of the electrons @xmath324 .",
    "the inner jet has radius @xmath325pc and a constant opening angle of @xmath326 .",
    "the product @xmath327g.pc is clearly too low to produce ultra - high energy cosmic rays . in any case",
    "it has been shown that even if centaurus a could accelerate cosmic rays to the highest energies observed @xmath328ev , their transport to earth , affected by diffusion according to the rules derived in this paper would lead to strong energy losses by increased travel distance and anisotropy incompatible with present observations  @xcite .    in the hot spots , the escape is again dominated by diffusion at high energies , but parallel diffusion is more likely unless there is no ordered field .",
    "for a hot spot of size @xmath329kpc and magnetic field intensity @xmath330 g as in cygnus a , the confinement limit is @xmath331 and the maximum energy achievable with a non - relativistic shock is @xmath332 the most extreme energy that can be obtained is when the turbulence is high enough that no organised field is set up in the hot spot , and the shock is midly relativistic @xmath333 . but synchrotron emission of hot spots , like those of cygnus a , does not favor this view .",
    "indeed the synchrotron emission by relativistic electrons cuts off in the infrared range .",
    "since an electron of lorentz factor @xmath261 synchrotron radiates around a frequency @xmath334hz , an observational upper bound on the electron lorentz factor is @xmath335 and the corresponding rigidity is @xmath336 now this maximum electron energy is obtained by the same fermi acceleration process , limited by synchrotron losses .",
    "we remind that the characteristic time for a synchrotron radiative process of an electron of energy @xmath337 is @xmath338 where @xmath339 is the thomson cross - section and @xmath340 the magnetic permitivitty of vacuum . by equating this loss time with the first - order fermi acceleration timescale",
    ", we obtain the maximum lorentz factor that can be achieved @xmath341 and the scattering function is calculated for the maximum rigidity @xmath342 . therefore ,",
    "assuming again kolmogorov turbulence with @xmath343 , we obtain the approximate value of the turbulence level by equating the two expressions for @xmath344 :    @xmath345    since @xmath346 is very likely , the required turbulence level is rather low .",
    "this , in turn , reduces drastically the maximum energy of cosmic ray acceleration , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : emhs ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eclhs ] ) and knowing that @xmath347 : @xmath348 where we explicited the scaling with @xmath21 the exponent of the power spectrum of magnetic fluctuations ; however note that the estimate of @xmath60 must be changed with @xmath21 .",
    "for kolmogorov turbulence , @xmath22 and using the upper bound on @xmath60 eq .",
    "( [ eq : turl ] ) above , the prefactor is of order @xmath349 , and acceleration is not sufficient to account for the highest energy cosmic rays by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this limit can not be circumvented easily , since it is severely constrained by the cut - off frequency of the electrons synchrotron emission .",
    "the only parameter that could be modified without affecting this cut - off frequency is the turbulence index @xmath21 .",
    "if one considers kraichnan turbulence @xmath350 instead of kolmogorov turbulence , the prefactor @xmath351 is changed into @xmath352 , but @xmath60 itself is lowered by a factor @xmath302 due to the modified dependence of @xmath58 on @xmath342 .",
    "furthermore if hot spots were to radiate synchrotron emission in x - rays , this would increase @xmath353 by a factor @xmath302 only , and would not affect drastically our conclusions .",
    "finally the numbers considered above are consistent with recent observations of the cygnus a hot spots by chandra  @xcite , which give an accurate measurement of the magnetic field intensity @xmath354 g to within a few tens of percents , as obtained by the ratio of the synchrotron - self compton luminosity over the synchrotron luminosity , a value which is furthermore close to the equipartition value if there are no protons !",
    "these measurements also confirm model dependent estimates proposed in 1986  @xcite . finally , as an aside , the same reasoning allows to estimate the level of turbulence required to get the x - ray emission in centaurus a : with @xmath355 , @xmath356 , and @xmath357 .",
    "let us first summarize the results we have obtained . the scattering function",
    "@xmath58 has been found to follow the scaling predicted by quasi - linear theory in the inertial range @xmath358 for weak to strong turbulence .",
    "however we found that scattering still operates for @xmath359 , contrary to the predicted sudden drop of the scattering function ; this facilitates the injection of particles in fermi processes . for larmor radii larger than the correlation length @xmath166 , scattering decreases as a power - law in rigidity unlike the predicted sudden drop of @xmath58 .",
    "therefore high rigidity particles still diffuse .",
    "one should also mention that the lack of scattering encountered in weak turbulence theory for particles having pitch angle close to @xmath360 is cured in strong enough turbulence .",
    "the perpendicular diffusion turns out to be very different from the prediction of the quasi - linear theory .",
    "our investigation of the chaos of magnetic field lines characterised by a kolmogorov length and a diffusion coefficient with space increment indicates that this process of magnetic diffusion governs the transverse diffusion of particles .",
    "our numerical experiment shows that the phenomenological bohm approximation , characterized here by @xmath361 and @xmath362 with @xmath363 , only applies in a limited range of rigidities @xmath364 , and only in the case of pure turbulence @xmath146 .",
    "many estimates in astroparticle physics , that rely on the bohm conjecture , must be reconsidered .",
    "the slow decrease @xmath365 of scattering for cosmic rays with larmor radius larger than the correlation length of the magnetic field , which implies @xmath366 , is of potential importance to the transport of high energy cosmic rays in our galaxy as well as ultra - high energy cosmic rays in the intergalactic medium .",
    "the accurate knowledge of the transport coefficients allows to be more conclusive than before on the performances of fermi acceleration in some astronomical sources of high energy cosmic rays such as supernovae remnants , super - bubbles and extragalactic jets . using new chandra data , the turbulence level and the maximum energy for electrons and for cosmic rays can be determined .",
    "we confirm the difficulty to obtain energies larger than @xmath367ev in supernovae remnants and shows that the `` knee '' range of the cosmic ray spectrum could be accounted for by second order fermi acceleration in super bubbles .",
    "we also confirm that fr1 jets , such as centaurus a , although radiating synchrotron in x - rays , can not produce uhe cosmic rays . on the contrary , fr2 jets can produce cosmic rays up to @xmath368ev , but presumably not more , owing to a fairly good confinement ; however most high energy cosmic rays escape before reaching the end of the jet .",
    "hot spots of powerful radio - galaxies have always been considered as a promising source , but we have found that , because of the low turbulence level implied by the synchrotron cut off frequency , cosmic rays escape rapidly along the mean field lines by fast parallel diffusion and acceleration is not effective above @xmath369ev for a shock velocity @xmath370 .",
    "our paper left opened several important issues that we are currently investigating .",
    "in particular it seems crucial to investigate in more detail the existence of subdiffusive regimes at low ridigities for which we have found evidence .",
    "these regimes play a crucial role in the acceleration processes at perpendicular shocks  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have described magnetic turbulence as an ensemble of magneto - static modes distributed according to a power law spectrum .",
    "this approximation is justified by the small alfvn velocity when compared to the velocity of the particles",
    ". however it would be interesting to investigate the effect of temporal and spacial intermittency on the transport properties .",
    "finally we are currently investigating the transport properties of particles in non - isotropic turbulence as may be encountered in the vicinity of a shock wave , in particular in the downstream medium .",
    "the consequences on fermi acceleration will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the diffusion resulting from the random variations of the momentum due to the irregular magnetic field can be formalized as follows .",

    "however , in pratice , only the main resonances for @xmath424 are retained because the higher resonances involve shorter and shorter wavelengths which contain less and less energy for usual power law spectra .",
    "the contribution in @xmath425 modifies the gyro - pulsation in the rotation matrix @xmath426 and therefore is unimportant .",
    "we finally retain the following result : @xmath427 where @xmath428 is the product of the rotation and the transverse projector .",
    "we thus obtain the unexpected result that the transverse relaxation is longer than the parallel relaxation since @xmath429",
    ". then the correlation functions are obtained by averaging over @xmath430 and there comes a major problem of quasi - linear theory because the functions @xmath58 are proportional to @xmath431 for @xmath432 and vanish for @xmath433 because of the lack of resonance .",
    "this introduce long tail contributions to the correlation functions .",
    "this is the symptom of the `` sticky '' regime for pitch angles close to @xmath360 that tends to dominate the diffusion coefficients ; which requires to take into account mirroring effects and/or overlapping of the resonances for @xmath434 close to @xmath435 and those for @xmath436 close to @xmath437 , as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "this difficulty disappears in strong turbulence and for large enough larmor radii .",
    "the fully deductive theory of this regime is quite difficult .",
    "however some attempt can be proposed in the case where @xmath438 , i.e. @xmath439 , when the correlation time [ decay time of @xmath440 is shorter than the scattering time .",
    "thus , for a time longer than the correlation time , we can keep part of the quasi - linear theory , namely the expression of the relaxation operator involving the integral over @xmath441 .",
    "technically , this corresponds to the summation of the unconnected diagrams of the expansion of @xmath442 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a4a ] ) , the other diagrams ( `` nested '' and `` crossed '' ) being of smaller orders .",
    "therefore the correlation functions @xmath443 asymptotically decay like @xmath444 and @xmath445 now the main difference comes from the estimation of the correlation function of the field experienced by the particles : @xmath446 we propose the following heuristic estimate . because the particles follow the field lines when their larmor radius is smaller than the wavelength of the modes , we consider only the modes such that @xmath447 .",
    "the dominant contribution in the averaged exponential is then for short time , @xmath448 .",
    "because of the random distribution of @xmath430 over the unitary sphere , we get @xmath449 a similar result is obtained with a gaussian evaluation of the average @xmath450 \\ .        \\label{eq : a14}\\ ] ] inserted into the integral over the spectrum ( restricted to @xmath451 ) , it leads to : @xmath452 \\ .",

    "when @xmath58 is small , because @xmath460 , we get a simple result close to the previous one : @xmath461 this gaussian evaluation indicates the error made by the previous assumption .",
    "thus , for small @xmath59 , we obtain the extension of the quasi - linear result , namely @xmath462 , and for @xmath463 to @xmath464 .",
    "these two approximations are in agreement with the numerical experiments , except that the measured drop is in @xmath465 instead of @xmath466 here .",
    "now the range of @xmath59 values where @xmath58 is on the order of unity corresponds to the `` bohm estimate '' , which is , in fact , the maximum value of @xmath58 achieved for @xmath467 only .",
    "we thus propose the following final estimate for the scattering function : @xmath468 the error on the coefficient is of order ten percent ."
