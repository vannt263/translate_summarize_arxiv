    ", there is an observed separatrix occurring at a critical volume fraction @xmath39 , which we identify as the jamming point ; stresses scale quadratically with shear rate below @xmath39 but show no rate dependence above it .",
    "these two bands correspond to the inertial and quasi - static regimes , respectively . as shear rate increases , the quasi - static and inertial isochores approach a shared asymptote characteristic of the critical point in which dependence on the volume fraction vanishes ; this region corresponds to the intermediate regime .",

    "it should be noted that these critical values inferred from dynamical behavior of sheared systems are unique for each case of @xmath19 and hence may differ from the jamming points of static packings , which are not unique and depend on the compactivity  @xcite .",

    "such a map is shown in figure  [ fig : regime_map ] .",
    "the intermediate regime is observed to lie in a window centered around @xmath41 , and the width of this window is dependent on the value of the dimensionless shear rate .",
    "this feature has important implications for the modeling of dense granular flows .",
    "the large stiffness of granular materials such as sand or glass beads has been used to justify the modeling of granular particles as ( infinitely ) hard spheres . for such particles ,",
    "dimensional analysis requires the traditional bagnold scaling of the stresses ( i.e.  @xmath42 ) , thereby rendering the intermediate and quasi - static regimes impossible .",
    "this picture is consistent with the vanishing of the intermediate regime observed in figure  [ fig : regime_map ] as @xmath43 .",
    "however , real granular materials do nevertheless have a finite stiffness . therefore , in the context of building a general rheological model for granular flows , it is preferable to choose a framework that include all three regimes .",
    "another important observation from figure  [ fig : regime_map ] is the smoothness of the transitions between the regimes .",
    "this feature suggests that purely quasi - static , inertial , or intermediate flow is achieved only in certain limits .",
    "as @xmath44 , we see quasi - static flow for @xmath45 , inertial flow for @xmath46 , and intermediate flow at @xmath41 . we also see intermediate flow as @xmath47 for all volume fractions over the wide range examined in this study .",
    "the smooth transitions also suggest that the rheology at a particular @xmath48 is a composite of contributions from low-@xmath49 and high-@xmath49 behaviors , and this notion will play a large role in our construction of a rheological model .    , with volume fraction vs. dimensionless shear rate .",
    "the intermediate regime occurs only at @xmath39 in the limit @xmath44 but emerges from this point to encompass all volume fractions as @xmath47 .",
    "[ fig : regime_map],width=3 ]",
    "because @xmath39 plays such an important role in governing the rheology in each of the three flow regimes , accurate estimation of its value for each case of @xmath19 is required for the construction of a valid rheological model . however , this task is made difficult by fluctuations of our measurements in time @xmath50 .",
    "we observe a propensity for assemblies near @xmath39 to form and break force chains intermittently during the shearing process , resulting in stress fluctuations of several orders of magnitude as seen in figure  [ fig : fluct]a .",
    "though fluctuations occur at all volume fractions , their size relative to the mean is markedly large near the critical point . in figure",
    "[ fig : fluct]b the standard deviation @xmath51 of the pressure , when scaled by the time - averaged pressure @xmath52 , exhibits a spike centered slightly under @xmath39 .",
    "this phenomenon increases the potential error in the time - averaged stress values near the critical point , thereby limiting the precision of our @xmath39 estimates to within about @xmath53 .",
    "additionally , though @xmath39 is certainly an important quantity , it is not necessarily the only or even the most influential parameter describing the jamming transition .",
    "the fact that stress can vary significantly at a constant volume fraction indicates that , while @xmath25 is a useful predictor of time - averaged stresses , other state variables may be more suitable for predicting instantaneous stresses .",
    "this quality has been observed previously with the coordination number @xmath54 , for example , which was shown to exhibit a one - to - one correspondence with @xmath55 in the quasi - static regime  @xcite .",
    "indeed , we observe that @xmath55 and @xmath54 exhibit the same qualitative evolution in time ( figure  [ fig : fluct]c ) and a similar @xmath25-dependence in their fluctuations ( figure  [ fig : fluct]d ) . here",
    "we define @xmath56 for @xmath57 contacts occurring in the @xmath58-particle assembly .",
    "the @xmath55-@xmath54 relationship suggests that the critical point is better defined by some critical coordination number @xmath59 .",
    "however , because our goal is the construction of a _ steady - state _ rheological model , it is convenient to ignore all dynamics and assume that @xmath59 and @xmath39 correspond to the same conditions .",
    "we therefore proceed with @xmath39 as the definition of the critical point for our model .",
    "in addition to being a function of @xmath19 , the critical point has also been proposed to change with the restitution coefficient @xmath60  @xcite , and such a @xmath61 has been used in a kinetic theory for frictional particles  @xcite . however , our dem results do not support this conclusion , especially for frictional particles .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : e_dep]a - b for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the spike in the pressure fluctuations occurs at the same volume fraction for a given @xmath19 regardless of the value of @xmath60 , suggesting that @xmath40 only . even for the frictionless case ( figure  [ fig : e_dep]c ) , where fluctuations tend occur over a wider range of volume fractions",
    ", there is no clear trend in the peak towards lower @xmath25 .",
    "one possible reason for the discrepancy is the methods used for determining @xmath39 . because hard - sphere codes , used in ref .",
    "@xcite , prohibit particle overlaps , they are unable to simulate sheared particle systems near or above @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "this shortcoming limits the performable simulations to one side of @xmath39 , thus requiring the critical point to be estimated via extrapolation .",
    "furthermore , while hard - sphere methods treat collisions as binary interactions , entrance into the quasi - static regime coincides with the development of multi - body interactions that persist even in the hard - sphere limit  @xcite .",
    "this conflict may render even - driven algorithms less accurate at resolving collisions upon approaching @xmath39 and perhaps result in an erroneous estimation of the value of @xmath39 .",
    "soft - sphere dem , on the other hand , enables us to resolve multi - body contacts and simulate shear flows at any volume fraction on either side of @xmath39 , thereby allowing us to _ interpolate _ the value of @xmath39 . for these reasons ,",
    "we expect the latter approach to provide more accurate @xmath39 estimates .",
    "it has been demonstrated in experimental  @xcite and computational  @xcite studies of frictionless particles that stress data will collapse onto two curves ( one above @xmath39 and one below ) upon scaling the stresses and shear rate by powers of @xmath64 , the distance to jamming .",
    "this idea is consistent with several models of the radial distribution function , used in kinetic theories for the inertial regime , that diverge at close packing  @xcite .",
    "such a collapse can be achieved for frictional particles as well , as shown in figure  [ fig : hatano ] , with @xmath65 and constitutive exponents @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this result for frictional disks was also found independently in ref .",
    "@xcite . from the collapse it is clear that an asymptotic power - law relationship between stress and shear rate exists for each flow regime @xmath1 , and we can write the form of each asymptote as @xmath68^{m_j }      \\label{eq : asymptote_p } %    \\\\ %    \\frac{\\tau_j}{|\\phi-\\phi_c|^{a_2 } } & \\sim \\left ( \\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}}{|\\phi-\\phi_c|^{b_2 } } \\right)^{n_j } %    \\label{eq : asymptote_tau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 . the exponents @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be fitted from the dem data , but the values are sensitive to the choice of @xmath39 used  @xcite and hence should be chosen with care .",
    "our inertial regime data suggest that @xmath72 , which is consistent with previous results  @xcite ; quasi - static regime data reveal that @xmath73 ; and , as noted earlier , @xmath74 .",
    "these trends lead us to set @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath78 value is consistent with our fits of the intermediate asymptote ( table  [ tab : phi_c ] ) and with experimental results  @xcite , and it is similar to other values proposed for frictionless particles using the linear spring - dashpot model  @xcite . the value of @xmath66 used in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath79 ) , though different , still yields a decent collapse .",
    "however , in that work , @xmath39 is determined by extrapolation from the quasi - static regime , while here we interpolate it from quasi - static and inertial regime data and furthermore verify it with stress fluctuation data , as described in section  [ sec : phi_c ] ; hence we believe our current @xmath39 values and the resulting @xmath66 value to be more accurate .",
    "we also point out that the above scaling exponents depend on the contact model used  @xcite . based on a small set of simple shear simulations with a hertzian contact model",
    ", we observe the values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 to be larger than in the lsd case by a factor of @xmath82 , which is consistent with previous results for static , jammed systems  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath67 , however , remains the same for both contact models ; note that in both cases @xmath83 in order to satisfy the functional forms implied by the collapse .",
    "the resulting collapse for the hertzian particles is shown in figure  [ fig : hertz ] .    though the individual regime limits can be described using eq .",
    "[ eq : asymptote_p ] , the transitions between them have yet to be modeled . to this end",
    ", we employ a blending function @xmath84 of the form @xmath85 with @xmath86 yielding an additive blend for the quasi - static - to - intermediate transition and @xmath87 providing a harmonic blend for the inertial - to - intermediate transition .",

    "regime asymptotes and transitions are captured by the same blending function ( solid lines ) as in the hookean case .",
    "[ fig : hertz],width=2 ]    the blended model is able to capture the pressure behavior continuously in shear rate for all three regime limits as well as the transitions ; moreover , it does so without defining the stresses in piecewise fashion over arbitrary shear rate domains .",
    "notably , it also predicts the narrowing intermediate window around @xmath41 in the limit of zero shear rate , as the quasi - static and inertial contributions to the stress become small near the jamming point .",
    "the general form of the pressure model based on the hookean - case results can hence be written as @xmath91 with the individual regime contributions defined as @xmath92 the pressure at @xmath41 can be calculated using either blend , since eqs .",

    "there are a few features of eqs .",
    "[ eq : blend_p]-  [ eq : stress_inert ] that are worth noting .",
    "firstly , for systems above the critical volume fraction , the blending function yields a model of herschel - bulkley form , which has been shown previously to capture the shear stress of soft - sphere systems  @xcite .",

    "it is possible to construct an analogous model for the shear stress as for the pressure , as previous works have shown @xmath108 to exhibit similar scalings with respect to the distance to jamming  @xcite .",
    "however , because @xmath108 and @xmath52 both vary over several orders of magnitude , fitting them directly can result in poor predictions of their ratio , @xmath109 the shear stress ratio @xmath110 , which varies over a much narrower range .",
    "for this reason , we choose to construct a model for @xmath111 and then express the shear stress as @xmath112 .",
    "some recent , successful rheological models for dense granular flows employ a dimensionless parameter called the inertial number as the basis for achieving stress collapses over a range of volume fractions and shear rates @xcite .",
    "this inertial number @xmath113 is a ratio of the timescales of shear deformation and particle rearrangement , and the physics of granular flows of hard particles is said to be determined by the competition of these two mechanisms .",
    "when the particles have a finite stiffness , however , the binary collision time is nonzero and therefore presents yet another important timescale . with this point in mind",
    ", we note that the dimensionless shear rate @xmath49 identified earlier is in fact the ratio of the binary collision time to the macroscopic deformation time  @xcite , and we show here that it can be used along with the inertial number to characterize soft particle rheology .    in figure",

    "however , unlike in these works , we also observe significant scatter as @xmath114 becomes larger , which we will now show to be a consequence of the particle softness .",
    "because the inertial number models are designed for hard particles , we first limit our analysis to cases in which particle softness has little effect , i.e.  for small @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , quasi - static and inertial regime data of @xmath111 versus @xmath114 from our dem simulations collapse onto a single curve , with the quasi - static regime occurring for @xmath116 and inertial regimes occurring for @xmath117 .",
    "this collapse is seen in the inset of figure  [ fig : inertia1]a for @xmath62 .",
    "we model this curve as @xmath118 where @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 are parameters dictating the transition from quasi - static to inertial flow .",
    "this form is similar to that of jop _ et al . _",
    "interestingly , the increase of @xmath111 from @xmath101 is nearly identical for all cases of @xmath119 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : inertia1]b ) .",
    "since the interparticle friction coefficient for most real granular materials falls in this range , we conveniently take one set of constitutive parameter values as suitable averages for our model ; these values are presented in table  [ tab : model ] . the form of @xmath120 presented in eq .
