    "<S> the clear evidence of _ inverse _ thermal hysteresis of resistivity is observed under fc condition in between 85 and 200 k , indicating the first order phase transition at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the additional observation of minor hysteresis loops confirms the phase coexistence . </S>",
    "<S> the interesting features in the dynamics of resistivity is observed at 40 k , which is suggested due to the effect of domain wall dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> the mixed valent manganites with perovskite structure are fascinating due to the wealth of physical properties arising from interplay between structural , electronicn , and magnetic properties of the system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the co - existence of different competing factors often gives rise to metastable behaviour , which are evident from temperature rate dependence @xcite , unusual relaxation dynamics @xcite , frequency dependence @xcite , relaxor ferroelectric - like behaviour @xcite , memory effects in various physical properties of manganite compounds @xcite . the existence of phase separation is commonly noticed in these systems , where submicrometer ferromagnetic ( fm ) metallic and non - ferromagnetic insulating state can coexist </S>",
    "<S> . the insulating phase can be either a charged ordered ( co)/orbitally ordered afm sate or a paramagnetic state . the phase separation ( ps ) scenario associated with the out of equilibrium state has been reported in the low hole doped and co manganites . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the magnetotransport properties with the ps scenario has also been reported in the self doped compound , la@xmath1mno@xmath2 , where the interplay among electronic , magnetic , orbital , and structural properties are strongly dependent on @xmath3 and _ x _ @xcite . in case of la deficiency , </S>",
    "<S> fm orbitally disordered phase appears in presence of afm orbitally ordered phase associated with the structural instabilities in la@xmath1mno@xmath2 depending on the values of @xmath4 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of zero - field cooled ( zfc ) magnetization as well as in the ac susceptibility have recently been reported indicating the metamagnetic states , which were suggested by the effects of domain wall dynamics in la@xmath1mno@xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the extensive studies in the self doped manganites have not been performed as compared to hole doped and co manganites and it demands special attention because of the intriguing transport and magnetic properties .    in this letter , we report mainly on the resistivity ( @xmath6 ) measurements on la@xmath7mn@xmath8fe@xmath9o@xmath2 under different conditions of magnetic field and temperature cycling , demonstrating interesting features of field induced metastabilities viz . , field cooled ( fc ) effect , thermal hysteresis , and interesting dynamical features . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we incorporate a simple experimental technique of minor hysteresis loops to identify the phase coexistence in the self doped manganites . </S>",
    "<S> the evidence of metastable states in different manganites have been reported quite extensively based on the magnetization studies . however , the examples of such metastable feature in the resistivity measurement are rare , which is reported in this article for self doped manganites .    the polycrystalline sample with nominal composition , la@xmath7mn@xmath8fe@xmath9o@xmath2 was prepared by chemical route @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the final heat treatment was performed at 1200 @xmath10c for 12 h in air , followed by furnace cooling down to room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetoresistance ( mr ) was measured by standard four - probe technique , fitted with an electromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization ( @xmath11 ) was measured using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer . in zfc measurements of @xmath6 and @xmath11 , </S>",
    "<S> the sample was cooled down to the desired temperature at zero magnetic field and the measurements were performed in the heating cycle with the applied magnetic field . for the fc condition , </S>",
    "<S> the sample was cooled down to the desired temperature with magnetic field and the measurements were performed while heating . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of temperature in all the thermal variation of @xmath6 was performed at a rate of 2 k / min .    </S>",
    "<S> the powder xrd analysis confirms the single phase of the compound , which could be indexed by the monoclinic structure ( _ i_2/_a _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> temperature dependence of @xmath11 in zfc condition under 1.0 koe is shown in the inset of figure 1 , indicating a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition ( @xmath0 ) around @xmath12 205 k. the monoclinic distortion of the crystal structure and high value of @xmath0 suggest higher oxygen stoichiometry ( @xmath13 2.9 ) in accordance with the reported results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> temperature dependence of @xmath6 in zero field , zfc , and fc conditions are shown in figure 1 . in absence of field , </S>",
    "<S> an anomaly in @xmath6 is observed around @xmath12 209 k close to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the semiconducting like @xmath14 dependence is observed below @xmath0 with a change of slope around @xmath12 75 k. the mr is noticed below @xmath12 200 k , which increases with decreasing temperature </S>",
    "<S> . a striking observation of bifurcation of @xmath6 in the temperature dependence under zfc and fc conditions is clearly observed below @xmath12 200 k. the bifurcation of zfc and fc data has commonly been found in the temperature dependence of magnetization , when the metastability arises from spin freezing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the evidence of fc effect in @xmath6 is rather , a rare example among transition metal oxides , which has recently been reported even in few manganites @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a strong fc effect in @xmath6 was observed in the phase separated ( la@xmath15gd@xmath16)@xmath17sr@xmath18mn@xmath19o@xmath20 below spin glass ( sg ) temperature ( @xmath21 ) , where glassy behaviour was ascribed to the competing magnetic interactions between fm and afm states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the other kind of example of zfc - fc effect in @xmath6 was observed in co compounds , where the co state in the system is destroyed by the application of strong magnetic field , resulting in the different @xmath14 dependence of fc and zfc resistivities below the charge ordering temperature ( @xmath22 ) @xcite . in the present case </S>",
    "<S> , the origin of fc effect does not meet any of the above criteria rather , it exhibits another example of fc effect in @xmath6 in self doped manganites .    to understand further about the fc effect , resistivity and magnetization </S>",
    "<S> were measured by varying the magnetic field at selected temperatures under zfc and fc conditions as seen in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the non - linearity of the low - field mr curves at 150 and 100 were noticed below   0.6 and   1.0 koe , respectively , while the low - field mr curve at 170 k is different than others as seen in figure 2 ( top panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> in accordance with the @xmath14 dependent results a small difference between zfc and fc curves were noticed at 40 , 100 , 150 , and 170 k in the region of almost linear field dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the values of mr , defined as [ @xmath6(0 ) - @xmath6(@xmath23)]/@xmath6(0 ) , are   10 ,   12 ,   15 , and   20 % at 170 , 150 , 100 , and 40 k , respectively under 5.0 koe . </S>",
    "<S> low - field mr under both zfc and fc conditions and magnetization curves under zfc condition are shown in figure 2 ( bottom panel ) , where non - linearity is noticed till   1.5 koe for both the cases . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the magnetization curve up to 20 koe , exhibiting the typical features of soft ferromagnet .    </S>",
    "<S> the striking signature of metastability was observed by the thermal hysteresis in @xmath6 , when the measurement was performed in presence of magnetic field under the following scheme of @xmath14 variation . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was first cooled down to 25 k , @xmath6 was then measured in the heating cycle up to 275 k ( @xmath24 @xmath0 ) , and finally , @xmath6 was remeasured in the cooling cycle down to 25 k. the above scheme of measurements was performed both in absence and presence magnetic field . the thermal hysteresis in @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> was not observed in zero magnetic field as seen in the inset of figure 3(a ) . on the other hand , a clear evidence of thermal irreversibility in @xmath6 is noticed below @xmath0 [ figure 3(a ) ] , when the measurement was performed in fc condition under 1.0 koe . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the observed thermal hysteresis is _ inverted _ in nature , i.e , the heating leg lies below the cooling leg , despite the fact that @xmath25 increases with decreasing temperature . in case of a normal case of thermal hysteresis , the physical parameter under investigation tends to retain the high temperature or low temperature value , when the temperature is decreased or increased respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the bifurcation between cooling and heating curves occurs around @xmath26 = 200 k , which is close to @xmath27 , and they join up around @xmath28 = 85 k. we performed several successive cycles of heating and cooling in the fc condition with 1.0 koe of applied field and the observed inverted hysteresis loops were reproducible . since , the measurements are performed using an electromagnet , the question of experimental artifact due to persistent current in the superconducting magnet can be ruled out . to further confirm the existence of this hysteresis , we carefully measured minor hysteresis loops ( mhl ) in the region of hysteresis both on the heating and cooling legs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mhl were obtained by suddenly reversing the direction of temperature at an intermediate temperatures within the region of hysteresis and then the measurements were performed up to @xmath26 or @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the examples of mhl in the cooling cycles and mhl in the heating cycles are shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) and ( c ) , respectively . the clear evidence of mhl not only confirms the hysteresis , but also support phase coexistence , atleast , across the region of hysteresis . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of thermal hysteresis in @xmath11 as well as in @xmath6 were observed for charge order manganites , indicating the first order transition below @xmath22 , which have been observed even in zero magnetic field @xcite . in the present observation </S>",
    "<S> , the thermal hysteresis is also ascribed to the field induced first order phase transition associated with the pm to fm transformation at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the structurally driven first order phase transition along with the pm to fm transitions were reported for the monoclinic phase of la@xmath29mno@xmath2 ( 2.92 @xmath30 ) , though the first order phase transition was predicted based on the qualitatively from the analysis of magnetization curves around the transition temperature @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to understand insight into the nature of metastability , we measured the dynamics of @xmath6 in the measured temperature range . </S>",
    "<S> we did not observe any noticeable change in @xmath6 with time ( @xmath31 ) in case of isothermal holding in zero magnetic field for any temperature down to 10 k. even in presence of field , time dependence of @xmath6 is absent in the region of thermal hysteresis ( 200 - 85 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we noticed the change in @xmath6 with @xmath31 convincingly at 40 k , which is well below the thermal irreversibility and the change of slope of resistivity at @xmath12 75 k ( figure 1 ) . in order to shed more light on the time dependent character , we investigated the aging effect with the following experimental protocol . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was first cooled down to 40 k from 270 k under zfc condition , waited for different time period ( @xmath32 ) , and then , @xmath6 was measured with @xmath31 just after switching on the field . the dynamics in @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> was measured under 1.0 and 2.0 koe , where the mr curve exhibits nonlinear and almost linear dependence , respectively ( figure 2 ) . the @xmath31 dependence associated with different characteristic features in @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> were observed at different fields as shown in figure 4 . </S>",
    "<S> note that a sharp change in @xmath6 is surprisingly noticed after a time period roughly equal to @xmath32 = 60 and 120 minutes under 1.0 koe , while the anomaly in @xmath6 around @xmath32 is absent under 2.0 koe . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the common feature in the dynamics of @xmath6 under 1.0 and 2.0 koe show that @xmath6 vs @xmath31 plots do not follow the same path at different @xmath32 , like a aging effect in magnetization for the sg compounds .    </S>",
    "<S> the aging reflects the cooperative relaxation process . in case of canonical sg compound , the aging effect is commonly observed below @xmath21 , where the relaxation rate of magnetization , @xmath33 = 1/@xmath23(@xmath34/@xmath35ln@xmath31 ) , is found to be maximum around , @xmath31 = @xmath32 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the evidence of aging in @xmath6 is rather , a rare example even in mixed valent manganites . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the evidence of sharp change in @xmath6 at @xmath32 was also reported by wu _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. @xcite , suggesting the glassy transport phenomena in the phase separated cobalite . in accordance with this results , </S>",
    "<S> the sharp change in @xmath6 is observed directly in the @xmath6 _ vs. _ @xmath31 plot , not in the relaxation rate of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath6 in manganites are sensitive to the polarization of both the metastable state and fm clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the metastable states may appear either from sg state or domain wall dynamics , which can be distinguished from the low field measurements . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , @xmath6 is mainly dominated by the fm clusters in case of high field measurements . the sharp change of @xmath6 at @xmath32 under 1.0 koe indicates the dominant character of metastable component , while such an anomaly is smeared out at 2.0 koe , because of the dominant influence of polarization of the fm clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the above feature is rather consistent with the magnetization and mr curves as seen in figure 2 ( bottom panel ) , where the saturation of magnetization as well as the linearity of mr are noticed above 1.5 koe . </S>",
    "<S> the phase co - existence of orbitally ordered afm and orbitally disordered fm states were already reported for self doped manganites @xcite . in case of minor substitution of fe , fe@xmath36 occupy mn@xmath36 site randomly , which may introduce the frustration in the system . thus , the frustration arising from different competing factors can give rise to the glassy behaviour , which may be responsible for the sharp change in @xmath6 at @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the other possibility of the origin of sharp change in @xmath6 at @xmath32 is electron scattering correlated to the the domain wall dynamics , which is rather more plausible than glassy behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> note that the magnetization curve at 40 k exhibits the feature of typical soft ferromagnet , where the magnetization saturates at a very low magnetic field of 1.5 koe . in the present observation , </S>",
    "<S> the system was cooled down to 40 k , waited for @xmath32 and then magnetic field was suddenly switched on just before the start of measurement . in such a case </S>",
    "<S> the system keeps the tracks of domain wall movement in to the memory till @xmath32 during waiting at 40 k , which is reflected in the relaxation measurement , where the rate of mr discontinuously changes at @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the domain walls have a significant influence on the electronic conduction in fm metals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the influence of domain wall on the resistivity has been found to contribute significantly in different fm materials _ viz . </S>",
    "<S> _ , epitaxial thin film @xcite , ( ga , mn)as @xcite , nanowires of ni80fe20 and ni @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , the influence of domain wall dynamics on @xmath6 is not reported so far for ferromagnetic manganite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the slow relaxation dynamics in the magnetization and ac susceptibility have recently been reported for la@xmath37mno@xmath5 by several authors , which were suggested due to the domain wall dynamics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the observation of thermal hysteresis in @xmath6 confirms the first - order magneto - structural phase transition at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to confirm the origin of such field induced first order transition from this macroscopic transport measurements . </S>",
    "<S> however , the transition might be a weakly first order in absence of applied magnetic field , but in presence of field it shows first - order nature . </S>",
    "<S> note that the existence of local clustering and structural disorder were pointed out by troyanchuk _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. to establish an intrinsic chemical and structural inhomogeneity on the nanometer scale in the orthorhombically distorted and orbitally disordered insulating fm state in la@xmath29mno@xmath2 ( 2.86 @xmath38 ) @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . similar kind of scenario of structural inhomogeneity is suggested in case of minor substitution of fe , though the monoclinic phase is noticed from the powder x - ray diffraction . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , recent theoretical model @xcite supported by the experimental observation in low hole doped la(sr)mno@xmath5 @xcite also exhibits the existence of intrinsic structural inhomogeneity in manganites . </S>",
    "<S> here , the value of @xmath6 under fc condition reduces from the zero field equilibrium value below @xmath0 , which allows us to suggest that the size of the fm clusters consisting of orbitally disordered state increase under magnetic field , in consistent with the other phase separated manganites @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the growth of fm cluster might be related to the structural transformation below @xmath0 , in addition to the orbital dynamics in the thermal irreversible region @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed _ inverse _ hysteresis [ figure 3(a ) ] can be ascribed to the percolative conduction @xcite through the orbitally disordered fm metallic and orbitally ordered afm insulating phases , very similar to co compounds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although , the metallic ( @xmath39 ) fm clusters start to grow below @xmath27 , the overall resistivity remains semiconducting ( @xmath40 ) in nature down to the lowest temperature of measurement due to the dominant character of insulating phase . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the total resistivity , @xmath41 will have two components , fm metallic part , @xmath42 and insulating part , @xmath43 , with @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the metallic component decreases with _ </S>",
    "<S> t _ , which shows lower value in the heating cycle than that of the value in the cooling cycle in case of thermal hysteresis . </S>",
    "<S> if we believe that the metallic component of resistivity only shows the hysteresis , it will be reflected as inverse hysteresis on the resulting semiconducting @xmath41 behaviour .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented the evidence of metastabilities in the resistivity under fc condition , while such metastabilities do not exist in absence of magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal hysteresis in resistivity are observed below @xmath0 under fc condition , which suggests the first order phase transition at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the additional observation of mhl suggests the phase coexistence . </S>",
    "<S> the sharp changes in @xmath6 associated with the characteristic features of relaxation dynamics at 40 k are suggested due to the domain wall dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the authors ( s.g . ) </S>",
    "<S> wishes to thank dae , india for the financial support . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization data using squid magnetometer were measured under the scheme of nanoscience and nanotechnology initiative of dst at iacs , kolkata , india . </S>"
