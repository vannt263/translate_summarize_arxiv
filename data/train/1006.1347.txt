    "although the rate for hard photon radiation is calculable at nlo , photons must be considered part of the jet below an arbitrary fragmentation scale .",

    "nlo effects spoil the exact transverse momentum balance between the photon and the recoil jet which holds at lo .",
    "often the contribution from fragmentation photons is suppressed by applying an isolation criterion to the photon sample  @xcite .",

    "direct photons play the role of the hard - scattered parton ( see  fig .  [",
    "fig : feyndiag ] ) with the distinction that , as color - neutral objects , they do not interact strongly with the hot qcd matter .",
    "the absence of any nuclear modification for direct photons  @xcite therefore acts as a control measurement for the jet quenching phenomenon and constrains possible contributions from novel sources of induced photon production predicted to arise from the interaction of partons with the qcd medium  @xcite .",

    "the use of these additional data sets enables the separation of the quark and anti - quark ffs and provides much better constraints on the gluon ffs , although uncertainties for the gluon ffs remain large .",
    "despite the recent progress , the akk and dss differ quite substantially in a number of observables and discrepancies exist between fits and certain data sets .",
    "newer data sets and observables are required to further constrain the ffs .",
    "of particular interest for studies of heavy - ion collisions is the region of low @xmath126 where modifications of the ff by the dense qcd medium are expected . whereas inclusive hadron cross sections are most sensitive to relatively large values of @xmath126 ( typically 0.7 - 0.8 ) , two - particle correlations provide access to smaller values of @xmath126 using an asymmetric  selection of the trigger and partner .",
    "direct photons are ideally suited for this purpose due to the absence of near - side jet fragmentation effects at lo . however , higher order effect such as photon fragmentation and soft gluon emission must be constrained .",
    "the  effect is modeled by introducing a gaussian distributed boost of magnitude @xmath140 randomly oriented in the plane transverse to the incoming parton pair , _",

    "the width of the  distribution is taken from measurements of -hadron correlations and was determined to be  @xmath141 mev/@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the gaussian  smearing model has the advantage of simplicity compared to a more detailed calculation of the underlying jet kinematics and subsequent fragmentation .",
    "although nlo calculations are available , modeling the  smearing would require care to avoid double - counting the contribution at nlo with that of soft gluon radiation .",
    "a self - consistent approach to doing so would require a fully resummed calculation for which generator level monte - carlo simulations are not presently available .",
    "although a gaussian  smearing can be similarly tuned in more sophisticated lo models such as pythia , the lo+  model enables us to test various parametrizations of the fragmentation functions as opposed to using a model of the hadronization process .    it should be emphasized , however , that the gaussian  smearing model does not take into account the full parton kinematics and hence , requires some care to avoid unphysical scenarios .",
    "the lo cross sections are divergent in the forward and/or backward directions and the gluon distribution becomes very large at low @xmath124 . in the absence of  smearing these effects are irrelevant for production at midrapidity . however , for a gaussian distributed  of fixed width there is a finite probability for a parton to be scattered at large angle , solely by virtue of receiving a large momentum kick from sampling the tail of the  distribution . due to the largeness of the low @xmath124 gluon distribution and the cross sections at small angle these soft partons",
    "would dominate the cross section .",
    "this is clearly an unphysical consequence of the  smearing procedure .",
    "the  boost is intended to simulate gluon emission which should clearly be bounded by the momentum of the parton from which it radiates .",

    "the kkp and dss fits reproduce the shape of the data better than the akk fit , which shows a much harder slope .",
    "the disparity amongst the calculations seems to contradict the claim in  @xcite that the  distribution for  triggers is not sensitive to the overall shape of the ff . to test this assertion using the lo+  model , an exponential function",
    "was used for each flavor of ff .",
    "the slopes of the ffs were varied , using @xmath144 and @xmath145 , to represent the quark and gluon ffs , respectively , as was done in @xcite .",
    "indeed one finds that the calculation is not very sensitive to the change in the slope parameter .",
    "this exercise does not , however , take into account that a change in the shape of the ff for an individual parton flavor may change not only the admixture of quark and gluon jets , but also the shape of the  distribution of hard scattered partons , which is taken to be fixed in @xcite .",
    "since the pdf for the gluon is much different than for the quarks , the sensitivity of the   distribution to the parent parton composition of the   triggered jets can be tested by removing gluon scattering processes from the calculation . to illustrate this , the slope resulting from using only the @xmath146 processes with the dss ffs",

    "figure  [ fig : xeslopespi0isodir ] ( bottom panel ) shows the same comparison for isolated photon triggers . here",
    "the calculation depends less strongly on the choice of ff parametrization due to the smaller contribution of the annihilation subprocess , @xmath148 , compared to the predominant @xmath149 .",
    "in contrast to the  triggered sample , the shape of the  distribution depends rather strongly on the shape of the overall ff as demonstrated by varying the slope parameter of the exponential parametrization .",
    "the magnitude of this effect is reproduced in a gluon jet sample , in which only the annihilation process is turned on .",
    "the distribution for the gluon jet sample is significantly steeper than the data , verifying that the sample is dominated by quark jet fragmentation . as for the   triggered sample ,",
    "the monte - carlo  distribution becomes harder if the  smearing is turned off .",

    "the dominance of compton scattering in direct photon production implies that the flavor distribution of valence quarks in the proton should be reflected in the away - side parton .",
    "since there are twice as many up quarks as down and the amplitude depends on the electric charge of the quark , one expects an asymmetry of @xmath152 in the number of up quark to down quark recoil jets from the compton scattering of a valence quark and a gluon .",
    "one expects a dilution of this factor for several reasons , for example creation of charge pairs in the course of the parton shower process , corrections from higher order processes such as photon fragmentation and a contribution from sea quarks . nevertheless , a residual charge asymmetry should be apparent in the final state hadrons .",

    "the measurement of near - side hadron production associated with inclusive direct photon ( i.e. , without isolation cuts ) triggers shows no evidence for a large contribution from dijet processes , as might be expected from a large fragmentation photon component .",
