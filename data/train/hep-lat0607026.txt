    "recent lattice studies of topological charge structure in pure - glue qcd have provided evidence that the topological charge density , as constructed from the overlap dirac operator , organizes into low - dimensional long - range structure @xcite , consisting of 3-dimensional coherent sheets in 4-dimensional spacetime .",
    "a further study demonstrated that this structure is inherently global and that topological charge fluctuations in qcd should be understood not in terms of individual localized lumps but rather as extended brane - like objects @xcite .",
    "these lattice results challenge the traditional instanton gas or liquid picture @xcite , in which the qcd vacuum is described as an ensemble of localized ( anti-)self - dual lumps of quantized topological charge . on the other hand ,",
    "the results are quite consistent with the view of qcd theta - dependence provided by string / gauge duality @xcite @xcite , in which topological charge excitations come in the form of membranes or domain walls @xcite , which are the gauge theory dual of wrapped 6-branes in type iia string theory .",
    "although the nature of topological charge excitations in qcd is far from a settled issue , lattice studies may shed light on the dynamics of these coherent fluctuations and their relation to confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "analogous long - range sign - coherent 1-dimensional regions of topological charge density have also been found recently in a monte carlo study of 2d @xmath6 sigma models @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional @xmath6 models and four - dimensional qcd have many properties in common .",
    "in particular , both are classically scale invariant and have classical instanton solutions of arbitrary radius .",
    "lattice evidence for the existence of long - range coherent structures of codimension one in both qcd and @xmath6 strongly supports the understanding of qcd topological charge excitations in terms of membranes . in both of these models",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the observed membranes are associated with boundaries between `` k - vacua '' , characterized by an effective local value of @xmath9 which jumps by @xmath10 across the boundary .",
    "the presence of such domain walls in the qcd vacuum was suggested much earlier on the basis of large @xmath8 chiral symmetry arguments @xcite . the same kind of 3d membrane structure in qcd was also identified by lscher @xcite in the form of `` wilson bags '' which are 3-dimensional surface integrals over the 3-index chern - simons tensor and are analogous to wilson lines in the @xmath6 models .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the scaling behavior of the overlap - based topological susceptibility was studied for @xmath4 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . for @xmath11 and @xmath12 ,",
    "@xmath0 was found to scale properly with the mass gap .",
    "however , for @xmath4 , @xmath0 exhibits anomalous scaling behavior , giving an apparently divergent topological susceptibility in the continuum limit .",
    "this reproduced a result first obtained by berg and lscher in a monte carlo study of the lattice @xmath13 sigma model @xcite .",
    "the topological susceptibility @xmath14 ( @xmath15= total topological charge , @xmath16= spacetime volume ) in two - dimensional @xmath6 sigma models would normally be expected to be a renormalization group invariant parameter , which should scale like the squared mass gap @xmath17 ( @xmath18 mass of nonsinglet meson ) for large @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the bare coupling constant ) .",
    "however , the monte carlo results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite show that @xmath0 does not even approximately scale in the case of @xmath4 , although it does scale properly for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "lscher @xcite showed that the anomalous scaling behavior of @xmath0 for @xmath4 could be explained by the contribution of small , point - like instantons with a radius of order @xmath3 (= lattice spacing ) .",
    "although the action of a classical continuum instanton is independent of its radius , on the lattice this is not the case , and for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the small instantons have such a low action that they overwhelm the contribution of more slowly varying fields which might have been expected to dominate in the continuum limit .",
    "this mechanism is at work for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , but not for @xmath11 and higher @xmath6 models , because the action of the small instantons is proportional to @xmath8 and becomes too large to be favored for @xmath22 .",
    "( as we will show , @xmath11 is a marginal case where instantons are observed but do not dominate as in @xmath4 and @xmath5 . )",
    "the abrupt change in the nature of the dominant topological charge fluctuations as @xmath8 is increased above 4 provides a detailed monte carlo example of the phenomenon first discussed by witten ( for both qcd and @xmath6)@xcite , in which instanton effects are exponentially suppressed at large @xmath8 , and topological charge is dominated by quantum effects .",
    "this can be described , at least figuratively , by saying that instantons `` melt '' due to quantum fluctuations inherent in the large @xmath23 confining vacuum . for the case of the @xmath6 models , the instanton `` melting point '' is @xmath24 .",
    "the definition of the lattice topological charge density used in the original study by berg and lscher was an ultralocal discretization of the topological charge operator in the @xmath13 sigma model formulation.@xcite for our formulation of the lattice @xmath6 models , the simplest ultralocal definition of topological charge is the log of the plaquette constructed from the @xmath25 gauge links , @xmath26\\}\\ ] ] this operator is ultralocal in the gauge fields .",
    "it provides an adequate lattice definition of global topological charge and gives results for topological susceptibility which are similar but not identical to those obtained from the overlap formalism .",
    "but as a definition of local topological charge density the plaquette - based @xmath27 has severe shortcomings .",
    "it suffers from a large amount of short - range noise associated with local gauge field fluctuations , which obscures the long - range coherent topological charge structures found with the overlap - based topological charge density .",

    "the exact lattice chiral symmetry of the overlap dirac operator leads to an implicit `` chiral smoothing '' of the topological charge which takes place over distances of order @xmath3 .",
    "this reveals the coherent structure of the topological fluctuations without any subjective cooling or smoothing procedure .    in this paper , we investigate the origin of the anomalous scaling behavior of topological susceptibility in two - dimensional @xmath4 and @xmath5 sigma models , using the overlap construction of the lattice topological charge density .",
    "we directly observe small instantons with radii of order @xmath3 ( roughly one to two lattice spacings ) in monte carlo configurations for both @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in the continuum ( large @xmath19 )",
    "limit these small instantons dominate the topological susceptibility .",
    "in contrast to these point - like small instanton excitations , the topological charge in @xmath6 models for @xmath31 has been found to be dominated by one - dimensional line - like `` domain wall '' structures @xcite . after establishing the prevalence of small instantons in @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    ", we measure the action of an individual small instanton and show that the measured topological susceptibility is in good agreement with a dilute instanton gas calculation .",
    "finally we discuss a description of topological fluctuations in lorentz gauge which incorporates both small instantons and domain wall structures into a coherent picture in terms of poles and cuts in an analytic gauge potential .",
    "the lagrangian for @xmath6 sigma models in the continuum is @xmath32 where @xmath33 are n complex fields , @xmath34 , satisfying a constraint @xmath35 .",
    "this lagrangian is invariant under a local u(1 ) gauge transformation : @xmath36 , for arbitrary space - time dependent @xmath37 .",
    "we can introduce a dummy gauge field @xmath38 and rewrite the lagrangian as @xmath39 where @xmath40    to put @xmath6 models on the lattice , we introduce @xmath25 link fields @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath6 fields are defined on the sites as @xmath42 .",
    "the lattice action consists of gauge - invariant nearest - neighbor hopping terms , @xmath43 this lattice action is used in our monte carlo simulation to generate an ensemble of field configurations .",
    "the @xmath44 fields are updated by a cabibbo - marinari heat bath algorithm , while @xmath25 link fields are updated by a multi - hit metropolis algorithm .      the overlap dirac operator @xcite preserves exact chiral symmetry on the lattice via the ginsparg - wilson relation .",
    "for the present work , we employ a standard construction starting from a wilson - dirac kernel @xmath45 .",
    "the overlap dirac operator can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 it can be easily verified that this construction of the overlap dirac operator satisfies the ginsparg - wilson relation , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : gw ] ) .    using the overlap dirac operator",
    ", we can define the lattice topological charge density @xcite by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : q_overlap ] ) , where the trace is summed over spin indices in @xmath6 models and over spin and color indices in qcd .",
    "the overlap definition of topological charge is not ultralocal in the gauge links .",
    "this has the effect of performing some smoothing of the gauge field over a range of order @xmath3 . for smooth @xmath25 gauge fields in two dimensions",
    ", we find that the overlap topological charge at a site is reasonably well - approximated by the average of the four plaquette - based charges surrounding the site . for a rapidly varying field , and particularly for the small instantons that we observe in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the overlap - based charge provides a much clearer view of coherent excitations .",
    "the effect of the smoothing obtained by the overlap construction can also be seen in the structure of the 2-point topological charge correlator . because it is ultralocal ,",
    "reflection positivity arguments imply that the nearest - neighbor correlator for the plaquette - based charge must be negative . on the other hand ,",
    "the overlap - based nearest - neighbor correlator is found to be positive .",
    "this allows the overlap - based operator to detect sign - coherent structure even if that structure is in the form of small @xmath49-radius instantons or membranes of @xmath49 thickness .      using the overlap definition of the lattice topological charge density , we have studied the scaling behavior of topological susceptibility @xmath0 in @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath11 , @xmath50 , and @xmath12 sigma models .",
    "since @xmath0 is generally expected to be a renormalization group invariant parameter in two - dimensional @xmath6 sigma models , it is expected to scale like a @xmath51 in the continuum limit .",
    "there is a natural mass scale in these models which is the mass gap of the @xmath52 meson correlator in the nonsinglet channel .",
    "the zero - momentum meson correlator falls off exponentially at large euclidean time , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the mass gap .",

    "[ fig : chi_t_scaling ] .",
    "a constant value on the graph indicates proper scaling .    from the graph we observe that @xmath0 appears to scale properly for @xmath11 , @xmath50 , and @xmath12 in the continuum limit , but it does not even approximately scale for @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "our results confirm that the overlap - based @xmath0 exhibits the same anomalous scaling behavior observed in the @xmath13 sigma model formulation of @xmath4 @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig : chi_t_scaling ] we see that this anomalous scaling behavior occurs in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , but not in @xmath11 , @xmath50 , or @xmath12 .",
    "this is exactly the behavior predicted by lscher @xcite , who showed that , for @xmath2 , the topological susceptibility should be dominated by small instantons with a radius of order @xmath3 . in the next section , we will discuss the theoretical explanation of the anomalous scaling behavior of @xmath0 , present the direct observation of small instantons in monte carlo configurations , and discuss some properties of these objects .",
    "the divergent behavior of @xmath0 in @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be attributed to instantons with a radius of approximately one to two lattice spacings .",
    "these small instantons are short - range gauge field fluctuations with quantized topological charge . in the space of lattice gauge field configurations",
    "they reside near the boundary between the @xmath56 and @xmath57 sectors , in the sense that a small adjustment of the gauge links will cause the instanton to `` fall through the lattice '' and turn into a @xmath57 configuration .",
    "the dominance of these small instanton configurations violates the usual assumptions about the continuum limit . in a naive view of the continuum limit",
    ", one would assume that configurations are dominated by fields for which the values of gauge - invariant local densities ( e.g. action density or topological charge density ) are smooth over distances of order @xmath3 .",
    "although the probability for the small instantons to occur is exponentially small , the probability for more smoothly varying fields to have nonzero total topological charge is also exponentially small .",
    "which type of fluctuation dominates the topological susceptibility depends on the precise value of the instanton action .",
    "if we only take into account the contribution from the slowly varying fields , the topological susceptibility should scale like a @xmath51 in the continuum limit , i.e. @xmath58 however , if we take into account the contribution from small instantons , a dilute gas calculation yields @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the minimal action of gauge field configurations in the @xmath56 sector .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the minimum - action field configuration with @xmath56 was constructed and its action was calculated .",
    "this gave the value of @xmath61 in the @xmath13 model as @xmath62 for other @xmath6 models , it was argued that the minimal action of a small instanton should be proportional to @xmath8 , according to the inherent factor of @xmath8 in the @xmath6 action ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : cpn_action ] ) . since @xmath63 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the small instantons make the dominant contribution to the topological susceptibility .",
    "this explains why @xmath0 does not scale as @xmath17 in the continuum limit in @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "however , for @xmath6 models with @xmath7 , @xmath64 , so @xmath0 is dominated by less singular topological fluctuations . on the other hand , even for @xmath7 , the dominant excitations are not smooth distributions of topological charge , but rather , singular domain - wall type excitations which give rise to a dominant contact term in the 2-point correlator @xcite .",
    "+   +    even a qualitative survey of overlap topological charge distributions in the monte carlo configurations is sufficient to identify small instantons as the origin of the divergence of @xmath0 in @xmath4 and @xmath5 . to emphasize this point",
    ", we will first present a few typical configurations .",
    "small instantons are particularly prominent and easy to identify at large values of @xmath19 , where the meson correlation length @xmath65 is large .",
    "interestingly , the finite volume effects on the fluctuation of the global topological charge @xmath15 are completely different for @xmath4 and @xmath5 than they are for the @xmath66 models . for @xmath11 and higher ,",
    "the fluctuation of @xmath15 to nonzero integer values `` freezes out '' at large values of @xmath19 for a lattice with a fixed number of sites . when the correlation length becomes comparable to the box size",
    ", @xmath15 stops fluctuating altogether .",
    "in marked contrast , for example , @xmath4 on a 40x40 lattice continues to fluctuate to nonzero @xmath15 well above @xmath67 , where the correlation length @xmath65 is greater than 40 .",
    "this is apparently due to the fact that the small instantons remain of order lattice spacing in size , even when the correlation length becomes large .",
    "they are therefore not very susceptible to being squeezed out by finite volume effects at the scale of the correlation length . in fig .",
    "[ fig : small_instantons ] we show several typical configurations .",
    "[ fig : cp1_b25_q1 ] is a @xmath4 configuration with @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "it clearly shows a positively charged peak which is distinctly different from the background quantum fluctuations .",
    "we will refer to these objects , which are easily identified in the large @xmath19 regime , as `` peak structures . '' as we discuss below , the amount of charge contained in a typical peak structure is approximately one unit , so they clearly exhibit local quantization of topological charge . furthermore , for large values of @xmath19 , fluctuations of the global charge @xmath15 by a unit during the monte carlo run are always accompanied by the appearance or disappearance of one of these peak structures . for comparison",
    ", we also show a @xmath4 configuration with @xmath68 and @xmath57 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp1_b25_q0 ] , where no peak structure can be seen . fig .",
    "[ fig : cp1_b16 ] shows two negative peak structures in a @xmath4 configuration with @xmath67 and @xmath70 . because of the smaller value of @xmath19 , the background quantum fluctuations are seen to be larger than in the previous plots . the @xmath5 configuration in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp2_b18 ] also shows a peak structure with @xmath71 and @xmath69 .",
    "however , at comparable correlation lengths , the @xmath11 and @xmath12 configurations contain no prominent peaks and always have zero total topological charge on a @xmath72 lattice .",
    "[ fig : cp3_b16 ] shows a @xmath11 configuration with @xmath67 and @xmath57 , where no peak structure can be seen . finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : cp9_b09 ] shows a @xmath12 configuration with @xmath73 and @xmath74 . here , in spite of the fact that q is nonzero , there is no sign of an integer charged peak structure .",
    "in fact , for @xmath50 and @xmath12 , there were no integer charged peak structures in any of the configurations studied .",
    "the case of @xmath11 is interesting because , although there is some indication of small instantons ( see below ) , they are not as dominant as in @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "note that the one - instanton action of @xmath75 for @xmath11 is slightly above the instanton `` melting point '' of @xmath76 predicted in the dilute gas approximation .",
    "in the case of @xmath11 , the small instantons do not lead to any observable anomalous scaling of @xmath0 because their action is very close to @xmath77 .    to add further support for the assertion that the peak structures in @xmath4 and @xmath5 are indeed small instantons , we measured the topological charge inside the highest peak structure in each field configuration .",
    "as we will show in the following discussion , a good effective definition of the topological charge within a peak is given by the sum of the charges within a radius @xmath78 of the maximum - charge site .",
    "to illustrate the quantization of the charge in the peak structures , we analyze , for several values of @xmath19 and @xmath8 , a large sample of configurations which have a global topological charge of @xmath79 .",
    "for each configuration we calculate the amount of charge within the highest peak structure .",
    "the histograms show the number of configurations which have a charge within a given range for the highest structure .",
    "as clearly shown , the @xmath50 and @xmath12 models exhibit very different histograms from @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath50 and @xmath12 configurations typically have much less than a unit of topological charge in the highest peak structure , while in @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath11 , the majority of @xmath79 configurations have a structure which contains approximately a unit of topological charge .",
    "this clearly confirms that the peak structures we observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : small_instantons ] are in fact small instantons with a radius of @xmath80 lattice spacings . by contrast",
    ", the topological structures in higher @xmath6 models exhibit no tendency toward local quantization , consistent with expectations from the domain - wall picture of topological charge excitations in these models .",
    "+    to estimate the approximate radial size of the peak structures , we considered an ensemble of @xmath4 configurations on a 40x40 lattice at @xmath71 , where we have @xmath81 @xmath82 configurations out of @xmath83 . in each configuration , we started with the highest peak , then measured the topological charge density @xmath84 and the integrated topological charge @xmath85 within radius @xmath86 .",
    "[ fig : size_of_instanton ] shows the @xmath86 dependence of @xmath84 and @xmath85 with error bars .",
    "we see from the graph that @xmath84 drops to zero at about @xmath87 , while at the same time @xmath85 goes up to @xmath88 . for this reason",
    ", we define the peak structure as occupying the lattice sites within a radius of two lattice spacings from the peak .",
    "we also observe from the graph that the @xmath84 fluctuates around zero when @xmath89 and the fluctuation is comparable to error bars .",
    "this confirms that the radial size of the peak structures we observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : small_instantons ] is indeed roughly 1 to 2 lattice spacings .",
    "all of these properties fit precisely the description of small instantons , which arise on the lattice as minimum action configurations in the @xmath79 sector .    in order to compare topological susceptibility measurements with the predictions of a dilute gas of small instantons , we want to determine the action of a single small instanton by measuring the minimal action in the @xmath56 sector for various @xmath6 models .",
    "the value of the minimal action for a small instanton determines whether they will dominate the topological fluctuations in the continuum limit . for @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "the value of the minimal action also determines the form of the divergence of @xmath0 in the continuum limit .",
    "we constructed a small instanton configuration on the lattice , which consists of three vertical links of @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 respectively on three adjacent sites on a horizontal row , while all other links are set to one . here the value of @xmath93 is taken at the boundary between the @xmath56 and @xmath57 sectors , as determined by the overlap @xmath15 .",
    "this gives , @xmath94 .",
    "we then annealed this configuration ( by running the monte carlo on the @xmath95 fields at large @xmath19 with fixed gauge links ) and measured its action .",
    "the minimal actions we obtained are : @xmath96 for @xmath4 , @xmath97 for @xmath5 and @xmath98 for @xmath11 . for @xmath4",
    "this is close to lscher s result @xmath99 @xcite . since our lattice action and definition of topological charge differ from the @xmath13 model formulation , exact agreement between our measured @xmath61 and that of ref.@xcite is not expected .",
    "we also looked at how the lattice action changes when we let a @xmath4 configuration tunnel from the @xmath56 sector into the @xmath57 sector , starting with a monte carlo generated @xmath56 configuration and cooling it by running at a very large @xmath19 .",
    "an action step is expected which should be close to the minimal action in the @xmath56 sector .",
    "[ fig : action_step ] clearly shows the action step when the tunneling occurs .",
    "the action step is measured to be about @xmath100 , which is very close to the one - instanton action .",
    "some insight into the dynamics of small instantons in @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be obtained by comparing the measured topological susceptibility with the prediction of a dilute instanton gas calculation . in the dilute gas approximation ,",
    "the topological susceptibility is determined by the one - instanton action @xmath61 , and behaves like @xmath101 to test how well the dilute gas approximation works , we plot the quantity @xmath102 against @xmath19 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpn_defect ] , up to an irrelevant overall factor . fig .",
    "[ fig : cp1_defect ] and [ fig : cp2_defect ] show that @xmath103 becomes roughly constant at large @xmath19 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , confirming the dilute gas calculation .",
    "however , @xmath103 is a rapidly increasing function of @xmath19 for @xmath50 and @xmath12 , showing that the expected contribution from instantons ( [ eqn : chi_t_dg2 ] ) is much smaller than the measured topological susceptibility .",
    "this confirms the conclusion that small instantons are irrelevant to the determination of @xmath0 for @xmath104 .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the mechanism of topological charge fluctuations in different @xmath6 models .",
    "we will argue that small instantons and membrane structures are the two types of lower dimensional topological structures ( zero- and one - dimensional respectively ) that can appear in @xmath6 models .",
    "as we have shown in the previous section , small instantons dominate topological charge fluctuations in @xmath4 and @xmath5 and produce anomalous scaling behavior of @xmath0 , while @xmath11 and higher @xmath6 models exhibit proper scaling behavior @xmath105 .",
    "thus , in the continuum limit , @xmath4 and @xmath5 have infinite topological susceptibility .",
    "the original observation of this divergent susceptibility @xcite was obtained with an ultralocal definition of topological charge in the o(3 ) sigma model formulation .",
    "the fact that the same divergent behavior of @xmath55 occurs when one uses the overlap construction suggests that the divergence can not be eliminated by a better lattice definition of topological charge , and that it has some physical significance in the continuum limit . to gain a better understanding of this , it is useful to consider the topological charge correlator in euclidean 2-space , @xmath106 the lattice studies discussed here and in ref .",
    "@xcite provide clear evidence that , in the continuum limit , this correlator is very short range ( compared to the correlation length @xmath65 ) , so one might expect an operator product expansion to provide insight . here",
    "we consider an operator product expansion in the effective @xmath25 gauge theory obtained by integrating out the @xmath95-fields .",
    "taking the large n solution as a guide , we expect that the charged @xmath95-particles acquire a `` constituent quark mass '' @xmath107 . at the same time",
    ", @xmath95-loop effects produce a dynamically generated kinetic @xmath108 term in the effective gauge action .",
    "this effect leads to a confining coulomb potential between constituent @xmath95-particles .",
    "however , in the large @xmath8 limit , the confining potential is weak , corresponding to a string tension of order @xmath109 .",
    "thus , one can distinguish between a relatively long distance scale @xmath110 associated with confinement , and a shorter distance scale of order @xmath111 , which probes the substructure of the constituent @xmath95 particles . by invoking the operator product expansion in the effective gauge theory obtained by integrating out the @xmath95-fields , we are assuming that the distance scales relevant to topological structure are characterized by the confinement scale .",
    "the large @xmath8 solution , discussed below , provides a good illustration of the order of limits involved here . in the large @xmath8 approximation , after integrating out the @xmath95 fields , the action @xmath112 can be replaced by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a rescaled field strength obtained by the replacement @xmath115    the two lowest dimension gauge invariant , lorentz invariant local operators that can appear in the ope for ( [ eq : tc ] ) are the identity and the squared field strength @xmath116 , @xmath117 where @xmath118 represents operators of dimension greater than 2 . in the following discussion , it will also be useful to consider the corresponding ope coefficients for the product of two chern - simons currents .",

    "all of these results have a natural interpretation in terms of a two - component picture for topological charge fluctuations in @xmath6 models , which we propose and discuss in this section . to motivate this picture",

    "the way that this constraint is realized in monte carlo configurations is by the predominance of topological charge distributions which have a `` subdimensional '' character , i.e. ones in which coherent regions of topological charge are effectively either zero - dimensional ( small instantons ) or one - dimensional ( wilson lines ) .",
    "a more unified perspective on both of these types of topological charge excitations can be obtained by considering witten s holographic formulation of theta dependence in gauge theory @xcite . in this formulation , the theta term in 4d yang - mills arises from compactification of a 5d chern - simons term .",

    "these k - vacua are separated by domain walls , and the current @xmath184 is an `` edge current '' which is nonvanishing along these domain walls .",
    "thus , the 3d chern - simons / holographic view of theta dependence in @xmath6 models provides a more unified picture of the two dominant types of topological charge excitations in @xmath6 models . in 3-dimensional spacetime , both small instantons and the domain walls associated with wilson line excitations are 0-branes , i.e. particle - like excitations with 1-dimensional world lines .",
    "they differ only in the orientation of their world line with respect to the compactified dimension , with small instantons being wrapped around the compact direction localized in the 1 - 2 plane , and domain walls being world lines stretched out in some direction in the 1 - 2 plane . some further insight into this structure , which also exposes an apparent string / gauge connection ,",

    "implies that @xmath192 , within a localized region of spacetime and for a given gauge configuration , is a harmonic function , which can be written in terms of holomorphic and anti - holomorphic conformal fields , @xmath193 where @xmath194 . in this framework ,",
    "conformal symmetry is broken by the presence of instantons and domain walls in the vacuum , represented respectively by poles and cuts in the analytic structure of @xmath195 configurations contributing to the path integral .",
    "the local conformal properties of the gauge field implied by this picture provide some insight into the collapsing of the ope for the topological charge correlator discussed in section iv . to illustrate this point ,",
    "consider the leading ope term for the cs correlator ( [ eq : ope_cs ] ) , which is conformally invariant .",
    "this vacuum insertion term should be equal to the exact correlator in the absence of conformal symmetry breaking .",
    "the second term in ( [ eq : ope_cs ] ) is proportional to the ( dimensionful ) topological susceptibility , and thus arises from the breaking of scale invariance due to the presence of poles and cuts in the analytic structure of @xmath195 . in terms of the lorentz gauge scalar field @xmath189",
    ", the chern - simons current is @xmath196 , and the ope coefficient @xmath197 is completely determined up to an overall constant by conformal invariance of the holomorphic and anti - holomorphic terms in the correlator , @xmath198 and a similar expression for the anti - holomorphic part .",

    "again , dimensional considerations and lorentz invariance allow us to write @xmath204 ( here we have dropped an infrared divergent constant @xmath205 , where @xmath132 is an infrared cutoff mass . )",
    "the relative coefficient of the two terms in ( [ eq : c2_cft ] ) is determined by the lorentz gauge condition on the dual @xmath38 correlator .",
    "the long range @xmath206 behavior of the chern - simons correlator coming from ( [ eq : c2_cft ] ) corresponds to the massless @xmath207 pole in the momentum space correlator ( [ eq : largencor ] ) or ( [ eq : largencor2 ] ) .",
    "thus , the large @xmath208 behavior of ( [ eq : c2_cft ] ) exhibits the hidden long range order of the theory .",
    "again , the corresponding term in the topological charge correlator collapses to a contact term @xmath209 it is this term in the correlator which gives nonzero topological susceptibility .    in section",
    "iv it was shown numerically that small instantons only contribute to the @xmath210 coefficient and not to the @xmath211 coefficient in the ope for the @xmath141 correlator .",
    "we can now present a theoretical argument for this by showing that the contribution of small instantons to the chern - simons correlator is of precisely the form ( [ eq : c2_cft ] ) .",
    "the distribution of chern - simons current around a small instanton at spacetime point @xmath212 is given by @xmath213 thus , the contribution of an instanton to the correlator @xmath214 is proportional to @xmath215 where @xmath216 and @xmath217 these integrals are of the same form as the one - loop feynman integrals for the large-@xmath8 correlator ( although here the integral is over instanton moduli space rather than momentum space ) .",
    "again , as in ( [ eq : c2_cft ] ) , we drop infrared divergent constants which do not contribute to the topological charge correlator .",
    "this gives @xmath218 and @xmath219 combining these ( and dropping a constant term @xmath220 we get @xmath221 thus a small instanton gives a contribution to the correlator of precisely the same form as the @xmath222 coefficient , ( [ eq : c2_cft ] ) .",
    "we conclude that , within the dilute gas approximation , small instantons contribute only to the @xmath139 coefficient , in agreement with the numerical results of section iv .",
    "monte carlo calculations using the overlap dirac operator to study topological charge structure in @xmath6 models have begun to clarify some longstanding issues in these models .",
    "the @xmath6 models offer an ideal laboratory for studying topological charge in asymptotically free gauge theory , and precise and detailed parallels can be drawn between these models and qcd .",
    "witten s original arguments that instantons in qcd will `` melt '' due to quantum fluctuations @xcite drew heavily on the @xmath6 analogy , in particular the absence of instanton effects in the large @xmath8 solution and nonzero topological susceptibility at order @xmath223 .",
    "lscher s arguments that topological charge in qcd could be associated with `` wilson bag '' surfaces were also supported by the @xmath6 analogy , where the corresponding excitation is just the familiar wilson line . perhaps the most important simplification in the @xmath6 models , relative to qcd , is the fact that in one spatial dimension , a domain wall is a point - like excitation .",
    "this allows the success of standard field theory methods such as the large n expansion .",
    "the world lines of constituent @xmath95-particles which emerge in the large @xmath8 limit can be identified with domain walls between k - vacua , where the value of @xmath224 , interpreted as an electric field , changes by one unit of flux .    for the @xmath6 models , a value of @xmath24 marks the instanton melting point , i.e. the transition from dominance of @xmath141 by 0-dimensional instantons to dominance by one - dimensional line - like excitations . from a holographic 3d chern - simons viewpoint ,",
    "the melting of an instanton is actually the unwinding of a wilson line excitation which was wrapped around the compact dimension .",
    "thus the line - like excitations which are found to dominate the larger n models might be viewed as not only a replacement for the instantons , but in some sense the remnants of melted ( unwound ) instantons .",
    "the full dynamical implications of small instantons in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 models remain to be explored .",
    "one immediate question is whether these models can have infinite topological susceptibility in the continuum limit and still be consistent field theories .",
    "it is hard to imagine a more well - established quantum field theory than the two - dimensional @xmath13 sigma model , so we would be reluctant to conclude that this model can not be defined as the continuum limit of a lattice model .",
    "what seems more sensible is to regard the topological susceptibility as somewhat analogous to a mass parameter in a field theory with two or more independent mass scales . at least in more benign cases , sending one mass to infinity removes a sector of the theory but leaves the remainder of the theory well - defined .",
    "such an interpretation of infinite topological susceptibility is also suggested by a witten - veneziano type argument relating the magnitude of @xmath0 to the splitting between the singlet and non - singlet mesons . by this argument , @xmath225 annihilation diagrams , allowed only in the singlet channel , will increase the mass@xmath226 of the flavor singlet meson by an amount proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath13 sigma model is an exactly solvable model , and it s particle spectrum is known to consist of only an isotriplet of mesons , with no isosinglet . from the quark model point of view",
    ", this suggests that the mass of the singlet has been shifted upward , if not by an infinite amount , then at least enough to make it unstable . by all indications ,",
    "the mass shift of the flavor singlet meson is the only singular physical effect of the divergent @xmath0 , and the resulting theory is in fact well - defined .",
    "direct spectroscopic studies of the singlet channel for various values of @xmath8 should help to clarify this issue .",
    "the lowest dimension operator that couples to the singlet pseudoscalar channel is the topological charge @xmath141 .",
    "as we have seen , the two - point correlator for @xmath141 is dominated by contact terms and has little if any contribution from propagating intermediate states .",
    "however , the coupling of @xmath141 to singlet @xmath225 states may be suppressed , so it is difficult to even put a lower bound on the singlet mass gap from the @xmath141 correlator data alone .",
    "the study of other operators which couple to the pseudoscalar singlet channel ( e.g. smeared @xmath227 operators ) is essential for a complete resolution of this issue .    the fact that the usual scaling @xmath105 is violated by the contribution of small instantons is not surprising , considering that in the limit of zero lattice spacing , a small instanton consists of a unit of topological charge within a vanishingly small radius , so that the topological charge density is becoming singular in the continuum limit .",
    "the topological charge is much more spread out in the case of domain wall excitations and should have a better chance of scaling properly .",
    "however , in both @xmath6 @xcite and in qcd @xcite , the domain walls are found to be of order lattice spacing in thickness , so that , while they are less singular distributions than the small instantons , they are still not smooth on the lattice spacing scale and would seem to have the potential to cause some problems with the scaling of topological susceptibility .",
    "the naive argument that scaling occurs because everything becomes smooth and slowly varying at distances comparable to the lattice spacing is clearly not applicable here .",
    "the numerical result that , for @xmath11 and higher , topological susceptibility scales like @xmath17 and the physical @xmath0 approaches a finite value in the continuum limit is thus not immediatedly obvious and probably deserves a deeper explanation .",
    "we note that in calculating @xmath0 the integral under the positive peak from @xmath228 and the integral of the negative tail for @xmath229 cancel with increasing accuracy as beta becomes large , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp1_chi_t_pm ] and [ fig : cp3_chi_t_pm ] .",
    "this figure illustrates that , for the larger @xmath8 models , the positive and negative contributions to the correlator integral are separately diverging in the continuum limit , but their sum scales properly to a finite topological susceptibility . for the @xmath7 models ,",
    "this cancellation reflects the dominance of the @xmath169 term , whose coefficient scales to a constant , compared to the coefficient of the @xmath170 term , which scales @xmath230 .",
    "one of our main motivations for undertaking a study of topological charge structure in the @xmath6 models was to try to explore the theoretical significance of the recently discovered membrane - like coherent topological charge structure in qcd monte carlo configurations @xcite . as pointed out by lscher @xcite",
    ", one can at least naively estimate the instanton melting point in 4-dimensional @xmath231 gauge theory . in section iii",
    "we showed that with our lattice formulation of the model , the action of a small instanton was approximately @xmath232 the critical value @xmath233 gives an instanton melting point of @xmath234",
    ". it may be possible to increase the small instanton action and thus lower @xmath235 by improvement of the lattice @xmath6 action , but the lattice @xmath61 is bounded above by the continuum instanton action @xmath236 , so that any lattice action for the @xmath6 model will give @xmath237 ( thus , in particular , no amount of improvement will completely eliminate small instantons from the @xmath4 model . ) .",
    "the lowest possible value of @xmath238 can be estimated within the renormalized continuum theory alone , without reference to a lattice formulation .",
    "it corresponds to the `` tipping point '' in the integral over instanton radius in a semiclassical instanton calculation .",
    "this is where the integral changes from being divergent at the small instanton end to being divergent at the large instanton end .",
    "( for example , the integral over instanton radius in the @xmath4 model goes like @xmath239 . )",
    "the analogous integral in 4-dimensional @xmath231 gauge theory ( using the one - loop beta function ) behaves like @xmath240 which has it s tipping point at @xmath241 by this estimate , the value @xmath242 for real qcd is comfortably on the large-@xmath8 side of the critical value , but ( [ eq : ncrit ] ) is only a lower bound on the value of @xmath235 for any particular lattice action , so it is not clear how seriously to take this estimate .",
    "the monte carlo evidence @xcite that membranes , not instantons , dominate the topological charge distribution in qcd adds support for the notion that @xmath242 qcd is in the large-@xmath8 regime , above the instanton melting point . as is well - known , the integral over instanton radius in qcd is strongly weighted toward large instantons and must be cut off in an ad hoc way at about @xmath243 . from the present point of view this is an indication that instantons are unstable toward melting or unwinding .",
    "as lscher originally argued @xcite , by periodicity in @xmath9 , the vacuum inside a wilson bag of charge @xmath244 has the same energy as the @xmath245 vacuum indicating that the confining force between bag walls is completely screened by the appearance of an anti - bag .",
    "the analogous process in the @xmath6 model is just ordinary string breaking and the vanishing of the area term for integer - charged wilson loops due to charge screening . with the confining force screened , the bag - antibag dipole layer is free to expand and produce extended membranes with layers of topological charge of opposite sign juxtaposed , just the type of structure that is seen in the monte carlo configurations .",
