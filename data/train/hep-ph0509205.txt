    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath2 has recently been determined with a very high precision .",
    "a series of measurements with positive and negative muons by the e821 collaboration at the brookhaven national laboratory resulted in the present average value @xcite @xmath3 at this level of a one half part per million precision , this quantity is sensitive to subtle effects predicted by the standard model ( sm ) , including five - loop quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , hadronic vacuum polarization and light - by - light scattering , and electroweak interactions at two - loops .    obviously , @xmath4 may be affected also by interactions beyond the sm .",
    "for this reason , many researchers have analysed @xmath4 in various models of new physics and performed sophisticated studies of the sm effects which are an irreducible background in the search of unknown phenomena .",
    "a summary of the sm prediction can be found , for example , in the recent studies and reviews @xcite .    at present , the experimental result in eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) exceeds the sm prediction by about 2.6 times the combined theoretical and experimental uncertainty .",
    "this tantalizing discrepancy may be due to an effect of a new interaction , perhaps supersymmetry .",
    "however , it is important to scrutinize the sm prediction before a conclusion can be made .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a reevaluation of the largest part of two - loop electroweak diagrams , namely those without closed fermionic loops .",
    "electroweak one - loop corrections to @xmath4 were among the first quantum effects studied in the renormalizable electroweak theory , in 1972 @xcite .",
    "they were found to increase @xmath4 by @xmath5   \\approx 195 \\times 10^ { - 11}\\ , , \\label{oneloop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and weak mixing angle @xmath7 .",
    "the large mass parameter @xmath8 represents the mass of a @xmath9 , @xmath10 , or a higgs boson .",
    "this effect was too small to be measured in the then ongoing cern experiment .",
    "the desire to observe it motivated in part the latest brookhaven effort .",
    "two decades after the first electroweak result , kukhto et al .",
    "@xcite found that an additional virtual photon may significantly modify the one - loop value in eq .",
    "( [ oneloop ] ) .",
    "they estimated that effect as a -22% reduction  surprisingly large for hard virtual photons .",
    "this and an analogous reduction of the rare muon decay @xmath11 @xcite are due to the large anomalous dimension of the dipole operators such as @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    that large effect found in a subset of two - loop electroweak contributions was similar in size to the design precision of the e821 experiment .",
    "it therefore appeared as warranted , even necessary , to evaluate the complete two - loop result  a calculation that had not been performed before in the electroweak theory for any other observable .    in 1995",
    "a complete set of 1678 electoweak two - loop diagrams for @xmath4 was generated by a computer system @xcite .",
    "however , such large number of diagrams , many of which are divergent , could not be numerically calculated , at least at that time .",
    "fortunately , it turned out that the majority of those diagrams are strongly suppressed by extra factors of the muon - to - intermediate - boson mass ratio and can be neglected .",
    "thus , a complete two - loop result was found @xcite .",
    "the numerical value was found to be dominated by large logarithms arising due to photon exchanges and was , somewhat accidentally , close to the value found in its first studies @xcite .    in later work ,",
    "the renormalization group equation was employed to estimate higher - order logarithmic effects , which however are not sizable @xcite .",
    "the result of @xcite was obtained in an approximation assuming that the higgs boson is sufficiently heavier than the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bosons such that @xmath14 can be used as an expansion parameter . a recent study @xcite relaxed that approximation and found the value of two - loop contributions valid also for a light higgs ( moreover , the two - loop supersymmetric effects were evaluated in that paper ) .    in this paper , we reanalyse the two - loop electroweak effects . our goal is to check the previous results and study the higgs mass dependence .",
    "we present our results in a semi - analytical form .",
    "that is , the dependence on the higgs mass is presented analytically , while some parts of expressions that depend only on the well - known particle masses are , for the sake of brevity , evaluated numerically .",
    "a method employed for obtaining analytical results is also described in some detail .    in this work",
    "we focus on diagrams with only bosonic loops ( no closed fermion loops ) .",
    "the fermionic subset of corrections was studied separately @xcite .",
    "it was recently subject of an interesting theoretical controversy which seems to be settled now ( see @xcite for a thorough discussion and references ) .    in the next section",
    "we briefly explain the asymptotic operation which is the main technical tool used to obtain the analytical result for @xmath4 .",
    "section [ smcontribution ] presents partial results for various groups of contributing diagrams .",
    "first , we divide all diagrams into five subsets of topologically equivalent diagrams .",
    "then we give analytical or semi - analytical result for each topology .",
    "finally we discuss the renormalization procedure and evaluate necessary counterterms , provide the final numerical result and compare it with the results of ref .",
    "the method of asymptotic operation ( see @xcite for a review and references ) has been an invaluable tool in numerous recent studies of effects involving various energy scales . in the present problem , the mass of the muon @xmath15 sets the soft scale , and the masses of the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and higgs bosons ",
    "the hard scale : @xmath16 . as we explained in the introduction , the original study @xcite assumed in addition @xmath17 . here",
    ", we will not assume any hierarchy between @xmath18 and @xmath19 at the price of certain complication of our results .",
    "we would like to explain here the basic principles of asymptotic operation . instead of attempting a rigorous derivation or even a rigorous exposition , we will use a simple example to elucidate the method .    in this study , we are interested in two - loop feynman graphs @xmath20 , which have a soft - scale ( @xmath21 ) external momentum and involve internal lines with both soft - scale and hard - scale ( @xmath22 ) virtual particles .",
    "the exact value of the two loop integrations is a ( possibly very complicated ) function of @xmath23 .",
    "however , for our purposes it is entirely sufficient to know only an expansion of that function up to @xmath24 .",
    "the purpose of the asymptotic operation is to obtain the desired order of that expansion without having to compute the whole function .    for our purposes ,",
    "the action of the asymptotic operation on a feynman graph @xmath20 may be described with the following formula , @xmath25.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us first of all explain the notation .",
    "@xmath26 is an expansion of the exact value of @xmath20 in powers _ and logarithms _ of @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath27 are the subgraphs of @xmath20 in which all loop momenta are considered as hard .",
    "instead of giving an exact definition of which @xmath27 are relevant , we use as an example the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ asympt ] .",
    "c@c    c +   + ( a )    &    c@c & + ( b ) & ( c ) +   + & + ( d ) & ( e )     +     +    in that figure , @xmath20 is shown in picture ( a ) .",
    "subgraphs @xmath27 are shown in ( b)(e ) , and range from a single heavy particle line to the whole graph .",
    "@xmath28 is the taylor expansion operator , expanding a subgraph in all soft - scale parameters such as the light - particle masses and external momenta of that subgraph ( the latter include loop momenta of those loops that are not part of the subgraph ) .",
    "finally , @xmath29 denotes the graph @xmath20 with the subgraph @xmath27 contracted into a point .",
    "the physical intuition for that concept is such that all masses and loop momenta in @xmath30 are soft ; thus , from their point of view , the hard - scale subprocess in @xmath27 occurs at a very short - distance scale and can be contracted to a point . in other words ,",
    "the subgraphs @xmath27 create effective vertices .",
    "what do we gain from this construction ? we completely separate soft and hard scales for the purposes of the integration .",
    "thus , the resulting integrals can not contain both @xmath15 and @xmath8  they factorize into a part that depends only on the soft scales and another that depends on the hard ones .",
    "no non - trivial functional dependence on @xmath23 can arise and we obtain the expansion to a given order in @xmath23 by taking a sufficient number of terms in the taylor expansion of the subgraphs .",
    "the asymptotic operation greatly simplifies the types of integrals that we need to evaluate , as shown in fig .",

    "the only difference in the large higgs mass region is due to an additional approximation made in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the difference of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 masses was treated as a small perturbation ( first four terms in an expansion in @xmath32 were retained there ) . above @xmath33 gev ,",
    "the relative difference between two results is less than @xmath34 , well within the precision of the result in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the results differ strongly in the low higgs mass region .",
    "the result of ref .",
    "@xcite is not valid in that region since it was obtained under the assumption @xmath35 .",
    "we see that while the result of ref .",
    "@xcite seems to grow strongly for the light @xmath19 , the actual bosonic correction ( solid line ) remains moderate .",
    "( [ eq : result ] ) gives a finite result for the two - loop correction , expressed in terms of the fine structure constant @xmath37 , the @xmath9 mass , and the weak mixing angle .",
    "some of the corrections computed in this way are universal for all weak processes and it is convenient to include them in the lower order result by expressing it in terms of the fermi constant @xmath36 .",
    "this amounts to the substitution , to be made in all components of eq .",
    "( [ eq : result ] ) , @xmath38 with @xmath39 this transformation decreases the central value of the ratio of the two - loop to one - loop corrections by up to @xmath40 ( depending on the higgs mass ) and , in addition , reduces its uncertainty , since @xmath36 has been measured to much better precision than @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we have presented a detailed evaluation of the two - loop bosonic corrections to @xmath4 .",
    "our result confirms the previous approximate evaluation in the limit of the heavy higgs boson @xcite .",
    "our final number for this correction is @xmath43 where the central value was computed for the higgs mass of 200 gev , and the error encompasses the interval 50 gev @xmath44 700 gev .",
    "this is in agreement with the numerical results of an exact study in ref .",
    "in addition to the numerical result we have provided here a number of semi - analytic intermediate results . they give insight into details of our calculation , allow future checks , and simplify the evaluation of the correction for any higgs boson mass .    the uncertainty in eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) is due to the unknown higgs mass and is slightly reduced in comparison with previous estimates based on the approximate evalulation .",
    "the main variation of the correction occurs in the relatively low higgs mass range .",
    "thus , when more stringent limits on @xmath19 are obtained , that uncertainty will quickly decrease .",
    "the main uncertainty of the electroweak contributions will then be due to electroweak hadronic effects , as discussed in @xcite ."
