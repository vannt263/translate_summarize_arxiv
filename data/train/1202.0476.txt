    "the paper can be considered as a completion of @xcite and also @xcite by the most complicated and interesting and potentially most useful version of the problem of the @xmath1transform and their special functions ( @xmath1functions ) of any semisimple , but not simple , compact lie group @xmath0 .",
    "the rank @xmath6 of @xmath0 is the number of real variables of the @xmath1functions .    assuming that @xmath7 , there are two possibilities to introduce , what is then called , the even subgroup @xmath8 of the weyl group @xmath9 of @xmath0 .",
    "both options are mentioned in @xcite but only the simpler one of the two is considered there .",
    "both options have the most valuable property : they admit development of multidimensional fourier transforms , although rather different in each case .",
    "it is natural to expect that of the two versions each will find its field of optimal applications .",
    "therefore our aim in here is to consider the option that was passed over in @xcite .",
    "suppose a compact semisimple lie group @xmath0 is a product of two simple invariant subgroups , @xmath7 .",
    "we are interested in the even subgroup @xmath8 of the weyl group of @xmath7 .",
    "the simpler of the two options is to take as @xmath8 the product @xmath10 , while the second option , investigated here , is to consider the full even subgroup @xmath11 . since @xmath12",
    "the second option is clearly richer .",
    "there is an important implication of this fact for the class of functions that can be expanded in each option .",
    "for example , in the simplest case when @xmath13 and @xmath14 are rank 1 simple lie groups , @xmath10 is of order 1 , while @xmath11 is of order 2 .",
    "the rank 3 groups are considered all in detail in view of their likely applicability .",
    "the @xmath1functions of none of these cases were studied before with the exception @xmath15 which is a straightforward concatenation of three 1-dimensional cases oriented in mutually orthogonal directions .",
    "the pertinent standard properties of simple lie groups and their @xmath1functions are collected in section  [ general ] .",
    "two types of even weyl groups for semisimple lie groups are introduced in section  [ evenweyl ] .",
    "the continuous and discrete orthogonality of corresponding @xmath1functions is also included there . explicit formulas of @xmath1transforms for semisimple lie groups of rank less or equal to three are contained in section  [ etrans ] .",
    "comments and follow - up questions are listed in section  [ conc ] .",
    "in this section we collect some facts from the basic theory of simple lie groups , the weyl groups and their orbit functions . more details can be found in @xcite ( for lie groups ) , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( for weyl groups and orbit functions ) as well as in first papers of the authors @xcite .",

    "the weyl group @xmath9 corresponding to @xmath0 is generated by @xmath6 reflections and is specified by its coxeter - dynkin diagram .",
    "we choose a non - orthogonal basis @xmath16 of the simple roots of @xmath0 .",

    "in addition to @xmath26 and @xmath30 we also introduce the two other bases . the basis of fundamental weights @xmath31 which is a dual basis of @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath32 while the basis of fundamental coweights @xmath33 is dual to @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath34basis and @xmath35basis are also related by means of the cartan matrix . in the matrix form",
