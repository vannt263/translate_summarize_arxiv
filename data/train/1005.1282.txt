    "<S> we present a generalization of the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , with an explicit @xmath0-term and a supersymmetric mass for the singlet superfield , as a route to alleviating the little hierarchy problem of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . though this model does not address the @xmath0-problem of the mssm , we are able to generate masses for the lightest neutral higgs boson up to @xmath1 with top squarks below the tev scale , all couplings perturbative to the gauge unification scale , and with no need to fine tune parameters in the scalar potential . </S>",
    "<S> this model , which we call the s - mssm , more closely resembles the mssm phenomenologically than the nmssm as usually defined .     </S>",

    "<S> though there are two higgs doublets ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and 5 physical degrees of freedom in the higgs sector of the mssm , the lightest neutral scalar ( @xmath4 ) has properties that usually mimic the higgs boson of the standard model , both in its production and decay . </S>",
    "<S> however , unlike the standard model higgs , this susy higgs has its mass controlled by gauge couplings , leading to the well - known , tree - level upper bound @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the ratio of the vevs of the two higgs doublets , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> it is equally well - known that this bound is lifted by large one - loop radiative corrections , the largest of which come from loops of top quarks and squarks .    </S>",
    "<S> given the lower bound on the standard model higgs mass from the combined lep analysis , @xmath8  @xcite , it is clear that a standard model - like susy higgs must get a considerable fraction of its mass from these radiative corrections . in realistic models , </S>",
    "<S> this usually means forcing the top squarks to sit at scales above a tev . </S>",
    "<S> but these same heavy stops generate quadratic corrections to the higgs potential that force a careful tuning of the mass parameters in order to generate a standard model vev of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this tuning has come to be called the </S>",
    "<S>  little hierarchy \" problem , an unfortunate development in a model promoted for its ability to solve the ( albeit much larger ) standard model hierarchy problem .    </S>",
    "<S> many attempts have been made to alleviate this predicament , either : by hiding the lightest higgs from experimental discovery  @xcite ; by lowering the cut - off scale either explicitly  @xcite or by imposing strong coupling on the theory  @xcite ; or by extending the mssm through additional particles , operators  @xcite , or symmetries  @xcite , all in the service of lifting the higgs mass . in this latter vein , one popular route , going back several decades , </S>",
    "<S> is to add gauge singlets to the mssm and to raise the light higgs mass by mixing the singlets with the usual higgs fields  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest implementation of this approach contains only one singlet and is known as the next - to - minimal susy standard model ( nmssm ) . in the nmssm ( see  @xcite for a good review ) , one discards the @xmath0-term of the mssm superpotential in favor of a gauge singlet superfield whose scalar vev provides an effective @xmath0-term : @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the couplings of @xmath2 and @xmath3 to the quark and lepton superfields , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are arbitrary coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> ( we use the standard convention that the su(2 ) contraction @xmath14 . ) because the singlet vev is generated by soft susy - breaking mass terms in the scalar potential , it is naturally of the order of the soft masses and therefore of the electroweak scale , solving the </S>",
    "<S>  @xmath0 problem \" of the mssm .    though the nmssm is a very attractive model in principle , it is constrained by experimental data to live in very particular corners of its parameter space . in minimizing the full scalar potential of the nmssm , there are two large regions of parameter space which must be avoided : one in which @xmath15 receives a very small vev , leading to a small @xmath0-term , which is ruled out by the absence of light charginos and neutralinos ; the other in which @xmath15 is driven to large values , over - stabilizing the higgs potential and preventing electroweak symmetry breaking </S>",
    "<S> . a phenomenologically viable model must live between these extremes , while generating higgs sectors consistent with current experimental constraints .    within the nmssm </S>",
    "<S> , there are three primary ways to obtain consistency with the higgs searches at lep . </S>",
    "<S> the first is to push top squark masses and mixing parameters ( @xmath16-terms ) to super - tev scales , generating large radiative corrections which lift the light higgs mass ; we reject this idea , as it simply moves the little hierarchy problem from the mssm to the nmssm . </S>",
    "<S> a second proposal  @xcite is to mix the singlets with the higgs doublets in such a way as to generate very light higgs bosons that are difficult to produce and detect at lep , thereby avoiding all existing higgs search constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the third proposal , which has been studied for many years , is to use the @xmath12-term to lift the lightest higgs mass  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that , at tree level in the nmssm : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this well - known expression allows the lightest higgs mass to be raised above the mssm limit , though only at @xmath6 close to one , where the mssm contribution is in fact minimized . </S>",
    "<S> further , it is bounded by the usual requirement that @xmath12 remain perturbative all the way to the gauge unification scale so as not to disrupt the gauge coupling unification of the mssm . but the superpotential of the nmssm is not the most general superpotential one encounters when extending the mssm by the addition of one gauge singlet . in fact , if we only impose gauge symmetries and @xmath20-parity , the most general , renormalizable superpotential is : [ wfull ] w = w_yukawa + ( + s ) h_u h_d + s^2 + s^3 + s in particular , the most general superpotential contains explicit mass terms both for the @xmath21 pair ( the usual @xmath0-term ) and for the singlet itself ( @xmath22 ) , as well as a tadpole term for the singlet . in the analysis that follows </S>",
    "<S> , we will allow @xmath0 and @xmath23 to take arbitrary values at or below the tev scale , independent of the vev of @xmath15 , and so we give up any attempt at solving the @xmath0-problem ( or @xmath22-problem ) . </S>",
    "<S> but in its place we will find a lightest higgs more easily lifted above the lep bound . though there is no symmetry that explicitly forbids the tadpole term , the non - renormalization theorem will prevent it from being generated radiatively until susy is broken . </S>",
    "<S> we will assume that the tadpole term is either absent or simply too small to play any role in the dynamics of the model . </S>",
    "<S> finally , while the @xmath24 term is required in the usual nmssm in order to stabilize the potential in the @xmath15 direction , our potential is stabilized by the explicit mass term , @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> because it is no longer required , and because its effects will tend to be small anyway , we will take @xmath13 to be effectively zero in the analysis that follows . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the superpotential of interest here is given by @xmath25 we will refer to this very simple singlet extension of the mssm as the s - mssm hereafter . philosophically , </S>",
    "<S> the s - mssm is an attempt to _ barely _ extend the mssm ; not only is the particle content minimally extended , but the structure of the vacuum will be nearly identical to that of the mssm . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , our philosophy is similar to that in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and indeed those authors briefly considered a model like the s - mssm , though without examining its implications in any detail .    </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian for the scalar fields is given by the familiar @xmath26- and @xmath27-terms as well as soft - breaking operators . </S>",
    "<S> these are given by the usual mssm soft - breaking terms , including the bilinear @xmath28 , plus contributions from the gauge singlet . </S>",
    "<S> the terms relevant to the higgs potential are : @xmath29 the scalar potential in the higgs - singlet sector is thus given by @xmath30 + \\lambda^{2}\\left|h_{u}h_{d}\\right|^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\,\\frac{1}{8}(g^{2}+g'^{2})\\left(|h_{u}|^{2}-|h_{d}|^{2}\\right)^{2 } + \\frac{1}{2}g^{2}|h_{u}^{\\dagger}h_{d}|^{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on minimizing this potential , one finds three conditions similar in form both to the mssm and nmssm : @xmath31 and v_s= 2 , [ vs ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with @xmath34 as previously defined ; and @xmath35 the second equality in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ vs ] ) holds when @xmath22 is taken large compared to the other mass parameters , and it demonstrates that while the s - mssm is superficially very similar to the nmssm ( it has the same particle content ) , its vacuum structure can be quite dissimilar . in particular , the s - mssm possesses a limit , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , in which the singlet can be integrated out supersymmetrically , leaving the mssm as the low - energy model . </S>",
    "<S> as we approach this limit , the vacuum structure of the s - mssm resembles that of the mssm in that the minimum of the potential is at @xmath38 but @xmath39few gev . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , even when @xmath22 is not particularly large compared to the other soft masses , the vev of @xmath15 is highly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in the nmssm , the singlet can only be integrated out non - supersymmetrically , by taking @xmath40 large , leaving behind the mssm plus the fermionic component of the singlet superfield . </S>",
    "<S> further , the vev of @xmath15 must be large in order to generate an effective @xmath0-term , @xmath41 , consistent with chargino and neutralino mass bounds . </S>",
    "<S> but in order to avoid doublet vevs that are too small , the singlet must not be so large as to over - stabilize the higgs potential , constraining @xmath42 both from below and above . </S>",
    "<S> the physical spectrum of the higgs sector includes a single charged higgs boson ( @xmath43 ) , three neutral scalars ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) , and two neutral pseudoscalars ( @xmath46 ) . in the discussion presented here , we will assume that @xmath22 is the largest mass scale in the higgs sector ; were @xmath22 to be small compared to @xmath0 and the soft masses , one would find substantial mixing between the singlets and the higgs doublets , which would reduce the mass of the lightest higgs . </S>",
    "<S> but for large @xmath22 we can find simple formulae for the higgs masses as an expansion in inverse powers of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the  </S>",
    "<S> heavy \" neutral higgs bosons have masses : @xmath47 where the approximation holds for @xmath22 much greater than all the other mass scales </S>",
    "<S> . meanwhile the scalar higgs bosons , @xmath44 and @xmath48 , receives masses : @xmath49 where the first term is the mass of the lightest higgs scalar as calculated in the mssm ( replacing @xmath50 ) , and @xmath51 the expression for the @xmath44 mass in the s - mssm is most easily understood in the higgs decoupling limit , @xmath52 , in which it is also maximized : @xmath53 we see in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hmass ] ) the expected behavior that as @xmath36 , the usual bound on the lightest higgs mass from the mssm is recovered . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that we use the full , exact expressions for the masses in the numerical analysis below . )    </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to compare this result to the expression for the lightest scalar mass in the nmssm , eq  ( [ nmssmresult ] ) ; one finds several key differences . </S>",
    "<S> first , the expression in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nmssmresult ] ) is only an upper bound . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it is an eigenvalue of the @xmath54 submatrix corresponding to the @xmath55 entries in the full @xmath56 scalar mass matrix . </S>",
    "<S> mixing of the light higgs state with the scalar component of @xmath15 will suppress its mass , and so one usually tries to tune the mixing to be very small in the nmssm . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by tuning the off - diagonal elements in the scalar mass matrix : a _ - 2v_s . </S>",
    "<S> [ nmtune ] in fact one finds that the mass of the lightest higgs in the nmssm falls very rapidly as one moves away from this point . on the other hand , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hmass ] ) holds in the s - mssm in a wide range of parameter space , as it already includes the effects of mixing at leading order in @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> second the nmssm contribution to @xmath58 falls as @xmath59 , so that the effect of the singlet drops rapidly as one increases @xmath6 above one . </S>",
    "<S> this is unfortunate for the nmssm , because it means that the model only provides large contributions to the lightest higgs mass precisely when the tree - level mssm contribution is minimized . though the situation is similar in the s - mssm , here there are two terms which contribution to @xmath58 , one that falls as @xmath59 as in the nmssm , but another that falls only as @xmath60 , which allows for new contributions at intermediate values of @xmath6 , and thus potentially larger masses .    </S>",
    "<S> we now analyze the s - mssm in order to test whether we can obtain light higgs masses above the lep bound of @xmath61 while keeping our top squark spectrum below @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> since we have not embedded this low - energy model into a full - blown model of susy breaking , we can not speak with precision about the fine tuning inherent in our calculations , but the requirement that the top squarks ( and all other susy mass parameters ) fall below a tev is an oft - used substitute for a full fine - tuning analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> it is not at all obvious that the s - mssm can generate such large higgs masses . in the nmssm , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite was able to push the higgs mass all the way to @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , as long as the condition in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nmtune ] ) holds . </S>",
    "<S> but the s - mssm more closely resembles the mssm and so the vacuum structure , and corresponding scalar mass matrix , bears little resemblance to the nmssm case . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we will find that the s - mssm works equally well at generating large higgs masses .    </S>",
    "<S> our calculations of the higgs masses are done using the full 1-loop effective potential , including contributions from the singlet superfield . </S>",
    "<S> since it is well known that the 2-loop contributions can severely suppress the light higgs mass , we include the leading 2-loop contributions ( dominated by gluinos ) as calculated in feynhiggs  @xcite ; these negative contributions are added in quadrature to the result of our 1-loop effective potential analysis . though the leading - order 2-loop effects are the same in the mssm and s - mssm , sub - leading terms may differ , potentially introducing a small error into our analysis .    in order to maximize the light higgs mass , we take @xmath66 to be large , effectively decoupling one of the higgs doublets from the electroweak symmetry - breaking sector . </S>",
    "<S> we also maximize the coupling @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> however , because one of the advantages of singlet extensions of the mssm is the preservation of gauge coupling unification as in the mssm , we insist that @xmath12 remain perturbative at all scales up to @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> this places an upper bound on @xmath12 which varies with @xmath6 : @xmath68 at @xmath69 , but quickly rises to @xmath70 by @xmath71 and to @xmath72 for @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> this requirement is also commonly enforced in analyses of the nmssm  @xcite . in our case </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization group equation for @xmath12 is identical to that of the nmssm , except that we can set the coupling @xmath13 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ wfull ] ) to zero , increasing our allowed @xmath12 very slightly .    </S>",
    "<S> our main result is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , where we have plotted the lightest higgs mass as a function of @xmath6 for a typical set of s - mssm input parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for this figure we have chosen @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 on the red dashed / blue dotted lines respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath78 has been chosen to be @xmath79 for the figure , but makes almost no difference in the analysis ; @xmath80 is calculated as an output of the minimization procedure . in order to maximize the higgs mass , </S>",
    "<S> we are working in what is essentially the  maximal mixing \" case of the mssm in which @xmath81 . the black dashed line represents the upper bound on the mssm higgs mass for the same set of input parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> we note two results from the figure . </S>",
    "<S> first , for @xmath82 we are able to get light higgs masses above @xmath1 at @xmath83 , and able to get @xmath84 over a wide range of @xmath85 . for @xmath86 we can also get @xmath84 , but for larger @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> thus our results are rather robust against varying @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> second , we note that different signs of @xmath87 maximize the higgs mass for different @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is not apparent from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hmass ] ) , but arises at next order in the @xmath57 expansion .     in the mssm and s - mssm . </S>",
    "<S> the red dashed / blue dotted curves were obtained using @xmath88 and @xmath89 in the s - mssm . </S>",
    "<S> the solid black curve represents the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> see text for additional parameters used in the figure . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the susy - breaking masses in figure  [ fig1 ] are still rather large , so it is natural to ask how dependent our higgs mass is on the stop - loop - induced contributions . in figure  [ fig2 ] </S>",
    "<S> we show the dependence of the lightest higgs mass with respect to the susy - breaking masses ( upper dashed lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath90 and vary them between @xmath91 and @xmath92 , all the while setting @xmath93 , @xmath76 and @xmath74 , for three different values of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen , even for a very light spectrum ( @xmath94 ) the mass of the lightest higgs mass is well above the lep bound whereas for the same choice of parameters the mssm will predict a light higgs which is ruled out by experimental searches ( lower solid lines ) .     in the mssm ( solid ) and s - mssm ( dashed ) for three values of @xmath6 and assuming maximal mixing . </S>",
    "<S> see text for additional parameters used in the figure . ]    </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to ask how the s - mssm might be distinguished from the mssm or the nmssm at the lhc . for the range of parameters considered here , where @xmath22 is relatively large compared to the other masses , the singlet effectively decouples , with only small mixings into the higgs bosons and neutralinos . </S>",
    "<S> neither does the @xmath15-field play any significant role in the model s dark matter candidate . </S>",
    "<S> thus the dominant signature for the s - mssm ( and for the nmssm in much of its parameter space ) is a higgs mass measured to be larger than allowed by the observed top squark mass spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise the model mimics the mssm .    in conclusion , by marrying the next - to - minimal susy standard model to explicit , supersymmetric mass terms </S>",
    "<S> , we sacrifice the ability to solve the @xmath0-problem of the mssm but gain the ability to alleviate , or even solve , the little hierarchy problem . </S>",
    "<S> the s - mssm allows light higgs masses well above @xmath61 even for top squark masses well below the tev scale , and does so without requiring any cancellations among various model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the model presented here should only be considered the infrared limit of a more complete model in which the susy - breaking masses are generated  @xcite and perhaps also the susy - preserving masses . </S>",
    "<S> in such a model the issue of fine tuning could be tackled in a more complete fashion . </S>",
    "<S> but from a strictly low - energy point of view , this model satisfies all experimental constraints , including the lep higgs bound , without resorting to large loop corrections or fine - tuned cancellations among parameters . </S>",
    "<S> thus it would be a natural candidate for explaining the observation of susy with light stops at the lhc . </S>"
