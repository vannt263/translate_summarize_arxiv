    "a possible explanation for aging in biological populations is based on deleterious mutation accumulation whose effects are felt at late ages when the intensity of natural selection is lower : mutations in the genome causing diseases genetically programmed to happen at late ages will not prevent reproduction and these mutations may spread through the population @xcite .",
    "population dynamics always involve non - linear evolution equations and the attractors of these dynamical systems may develop correlations in the stationary solutions that can not be explained by the analysis of the equations",
    "_ per se_. on the other hand , analytical solutions to these equations may be very hard to obtain .",
    "the penna model for biological aging @xcite has been proposed as a tool to perform numerical simulations of dynamical systems describing age - structured populations subject to genetic mutations and to natural selection , allowing quantitative analysis of the possible attractors .",
    "it has been successfully applied to many different aspects of biological aging , considering asexual and sexual reproduction , haploid and diploid populations , different reproduction strategies , etc .. for recent reviews see @xcite .",
    "the asexual version of the penna model considers a bit - string associated to each individual of a given population .",
    "this bit - string is inherited from the individual s parent and contains information about the genetically programmed diseases that the individual will develop during its life .",
    "a one in the k@xmath1 bit of the string implies a disease to be switched on at age k. each individual dies whenever the @xmath2 disease happens in its life , that is , the locus of the @xmath2 bit set to one gives information about the inherited maximum age this individual may reach . to avoid an exponential growth of the population",
    ", a verhulst factor is considered through a survival probability given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the total population at time @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the carrying capacity of the environment . at each time",
    "step the living individuals grow older one time unit - usually called year - and the corresponding bit in its bit - string is read , testing for the genetically programmed death . after a juvenile period , ending at age @xmath7 , the individuals start to reproduce .",
    "different assumptions on the fecundity after @xmath7 have been considered to describe different situations ranging from constant fecundity up to age @xmath8 , with no reproduction after that , to increasing with age fecundity , describing trees or crustaceans @xcite that can grow very old .",
    "also , different protocols have been proposed to produce the offspring bit - strings .",
    "asexual reproduction is simulated by considering replicas of the parent bit - string except for @xmath9 bits that may suffer deleterious mutations .",
    "sexual reproduction protocols mix the information contained in both parents bit - strings and then consider mutations .",
    "there are many different results , for different parameters and protocols , but it is clear that in general the model grasps the central issue of decreasing natural selection intensity with age , yielding good results for the age structure of populations .",
    "analytical approaches to these models have been considered for the asexual@xcite and sexual@xcite versions of the penna model , confirming simulations results .",
    "many parameters must be considered in the models .",
    "some of them are inescapable ones : there are many different systems and species in nature and if one wishes to describe each of them as a consequence of such a general law as natural selection , the model to be proposed should allow for different sets of parameters , as mutation rate , for example .",
    "however , some of the parameters are intrinsic to the numerical techniques used , such as the length @xmath10 of the bit - strings . these parameters may be turned inoffensive if scaling could be found , that is , they could be related to natural units of the system . in a recent paper , malarz",
    "@xcite considered simulations of the penna model with different bit - strings lengths and concluded that a scaling may not be possible .",
    "when scaling is to be considered , it is always interesting to avoid discrete equations , since the size of the time steps relatively to some parameters may be relevant to the scaling .",
    "here we consider the asexual version of the penna model , as proposed in reference @xcite , and take its continuous time limit .",
    "it turns out that age must also be continuous , and bit - strings turn into strings of real numbers of semi - infinite length , over which a sum of dirac @xmath0functions is defined .",
    "we show that the lack of scaling is a consequence of the mutation protocol used , when the mutation probability is proportional to the inverse of the bit - string length , @xmath11 . on the othar hand , when a poisson distributed mutation probability is considered , as suggested by bernardes and stauffer @xcite , we show that the results are independent of the string length considered , provided it is longer than the maximum possible age predicted for the population .",
    "we do not contradict previous work without scaling since that work @xcite used a mutation probability that is proportional to the inverse of the bit - string length .",
    "moreover , besides the scaling with the length of the bit - string , we also show that further scaling properties arise when an adequate continuous time limit is taken to the evolution equations , allowing the definition of @xmath7 as a natural time unit for each population .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we take the continuum limit of the discrete model for asexual populations by considering two possible continuous time evolutions . in section 3",
    "we analyze possible mutation operators and in section 4 we present solutions and discuss scaling properties . finally in section 5",
    "we discuss the results and conclude that a full scaling may be found only when adequate mutation protocol and time evolution equations are considered .",
    "an analytical approach for the asexual , discrete version of the penna model @xcite considers relative populations @xmath12 , given as @xmath13 where @xmath6 is the carrying capacity of the environment and @xmath14 is the number of individuals at time @xmath5 , with age @xmath15 and death age @xmath16 , that is , the age at which the @xmath2 bit one of its genome will be read .",
    "the time evolution of these populations is described by the following set of discrete time equations : @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the total population at time @xmath5 , that is , it is the sum over ages @xmath15 and death ages @xmath16 of @xmath19 .",
    "the equation for @xmath20 states how offspring is produced .",
    "the related equation is @xmath21 where the birth matrix @xmath22 is the probability that a parent with death age @xmath23 gives birth to a child with death age @xmath16 .",
    "when only bad mutations are considered , @xmath22 is triangular and it is possible to obtain the exact stationary solution for the above evolution equations @xcite , provided the birth matrix fulfills the following conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath22 is a triangular matrix such that @xmath24 for @xmath25 , that is , parents can not give birth to offspring with larger life expectancy ( it corresponds to only bad mutation in the penna model ) .",
    "this is not biologically unrealistic for well adapted populations - advantageous mutations are expected to be extremely rare due to the large times required for noticeable species evolution ; 2 .",
    "@xmath26 , that is , the probability that the parent gives birth to offspring with its expected life length is different from zero .",
    "this condition is also expected in biological populations , and 3 .",
    "@xmath27 if @xmath25 , that is , the probability that a parent gives birth to offspring with its expected life length @xmath16 decreases with @xmath16 .",
    "in other words , the larger the parent expected life length , the larger the probability that a difference in the genetic charge of the offspring effectively reduces their expected life length ( the better the genetic code , the larger the number of events that can spoil it ) .    in the original penna model ,",
    "mutations are implemented in the following way : for each newly produced bit - string , @xmath9 loci on the bit - string with @xmath10 bits are randomly chosen and set equal to 1 , regardless their previous state .",
    "the birth matrix for the asexual penna model can then be explicitly obtained @xcite by considering the probability of one mutation happening in a locus with bit zero , and estimating the change in death age caused by that mutation .",
    "the birth matrix thus obtained fulfills the above conditions .",
    "the results depend on the reproduction strategy . for a given initial reproduction age @xmath7 and same mutation rate @xmath9",
    ", it can be proven that for final reproduction age @xmath28 , with constant fecundity after @xmath7 , there is a maximum possible life span @xmath29 for the stationary state . for initial populations containing @xmath30 ,",
    "if @xmath31 the population evolves towards an age structure that gives a survival rate fairly constant up to @xmath7 , and then decaying smoothly to zero as @xmath32 .",
    "if , however , @xmath33 or the initial population has a maximum life span @xmath34 smaller than @xmath29 , the survival rate for the stationary solution decreases smoothly up to @xmath8 or @xmath34 , where it abruptly decays to zero . in the special cases where @xmath35 or @xmath36 , reproduction happens for only one year and the whole population die after it : this is the case of semelparous species that present catastrophic senescence @xcite .    here",
    "we present a continuous version of this model , and discuss different ways of implementing mutations .",
    "we start by considering time as a continuous variable , hence age should also be continuous .",
    "as death can happen at any moment in time , the genome must be described by a real variable interval .",
    "to each individual we associate a genome function @xmath37 of a real variable @xmath38 , where the string length @xmath39 may possibly go to infinity .",
    "this function is a sum of dirac @xmath0functions , that is @xmath40 where the locations of the @xmath0functions , @xmath41 , represent the ages at which genetical diseases are switched on .",
    "we define the health status of an individual as @xmath42 such that the death age of the individual is reached when @xmath43 , that is , when the @xmath2 @xmath0-function  or the @xmath2 genetically programmed disease",
    " happens in its life .",
    "now @xmath44 is the relative number of individuals at time @xmath5 with age between @xmath15 and @xmath45 and death age between @xmath16 and @xmath46 .",
    "the total population @xmath18 is calculated from @xmath19 as @xmath47 where @xmath34 is the maximum death age in the population ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "there are two continuous time evolution equations for @xmath19 that are compatible with the discrete limit eqs .",
    "( [ eqdi ] ) , as we will discuss now .",
    "this approach is based on the product integration calculus proposed by volterra in 1887 @xcite .",
    "the first of eqs.([eqdi ] ) can be written in the continuous version as @xmath49 where the left hand side has been taken to the power @xmath50 and @xmath51 is a constant with dimensions of time@xmath52 such that @xmath53 in the discrete limit : @xmath54 is a convenient time unit . the above equation can be rewritten as @xmath55 where the total derivative can be displayed as @xmath56 clearly @xmath57 and @xmath58 . the stationary solution ( @xmath59 ) for eq.([dlog ] ) is then @xmath60 where we have dropped the time index for the stationary solutions .",
    "observe that this is in the same form as the solution for the discrete version of the model @xcite .      a more orthodox way of writing the continuous limit for eqs .",
    "( [ eqdi ] ) is to rewrite them as follows @xmath61 where @xmath51 has the same role as in the volterra description : a convenient unit such that for the discrete limit time interval @xmath53 .",
    "the differential equation is @xmath62 with the total derivative analogously given as in eq .",
    "( [ dtotal ] ) .",
    "the stationary solution is @xmath63    the difference between stationary solutions eqs.([solm ] ) and ( [ sols ] ) is not important when @xmath64 , since in this case @xmath65 . on the other hand , observe that the above equations allow @xmath66 . both solutions depend on the newborn populations @xmath67 that in turn depend on the birth matrix @xmath22 , that is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the number of offspring produced per fertile individual per time unit .    before proceeding with the solution",
    "let us obtain @xmath22 .",
    "here we shall consider two ways of implementing mutations , an analogue to the discrete penna model and a poisson distributed probability of happening mutations .",
    "let us assume that the genome length is @xmath39 .",
    "one parameter of the model is the number @xmath9 of loci randomly chosen to assign a new @xmath0function on the genome .",
    "diversely from the discrete model , the probability of this happening on a locus already with a @xmath0function is vanishingly small .",
    "hence , the only possibility of the offspring death age being equal to that of the parent occurs when no new mutation happens before @xmath70 .",
    "the mutation operator @xmath71 for exactly one mutation is given as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the step function ( equals to 1 if @xmath74 and 0 otherwise ) that guarantees that the child death age is always less or equal to that of the parent .",
    "the birth matrix for @xmath9 mutation is @xmath75 > from eqs.([mu ] ) and ( [ fmu ] ) it is clear the origin of the lack of scaling : as @xmath39 is varied , the mutation probability per unit of genome length varies . and as @xmath76 appears both as a linear coefficient and as an exponent , it is at least not trivial to find sets of parameters that would yield equivalent solutions . on the other hand",
    "this mutation protocol is too artificial : certainly there are genomes that do not suffer mutations at all as there could be some that suffer more than a fixed number of mutations .",
    "a more realistic assumption is to consider a fixed ( small ) mutation probability per unit of genome length , taken from a poisson distribution , as we consider in what follows .",
    "consider the probability of @xmath77 mutations happening in a given length @xmath78 of a genome as given by a poisson distribution @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the probability of occurring one mutation ( adding a new @xmath0function ) per unit of genome length . to build up the birth matrix @xmath22 , there are three possibilities to consider : _",
    "i ) _ if @xmath25 , then @xmath81 , since we consider only the possibility of adding new @xmath0functions to the genome ( deleterious mutations ) ; _ ii ) _ if @xmath82 , meaning that no mutation occurs before @xmath23 and the offspring death age is the same as that of its parent , and finally _ iii ) _ if @xmath83 , when new @xmath84functions are added to the genome before the occurrence of the parent @xmath2 disease . taking all the possibilities into account",
    ", the birth matrix can be written as @xmath85   \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 guarantees that @xmath81 if @xmath25 and @xmath86 .",
    "observe that mutational meltdown may be prevented since there is a non - zero probability that some offspring are bred without additional harmful mutations ( @xmath82 ) @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the above birth matrix obeys the normalization condition @xmath87 that is the sum over all possibilities for the offspring genome .",
    "comparing eqs .",
    "( [ mu ] ) and ( [ pois ] ) , we observe that the mutation controlling parameters in the different mutation protocols are respectively @xmath39 and @xmath80 , that is , using poisson protocol the mutation probability decouples from the genome length @xmath39 .",
    "hence , since @xmath39 no longer appears in the mutation operator , the results do not depend on @xmath39 , and scaling should be expected .",
    "when only bad mutations are considered , there may exist a maximum life span @xmath29 to the steady state solutions that is independent of @xmath39 . in this case , the stationary solutions are not affected by bits located after @xmath29 and consequently are independent of @xmath39 , provided the mutation rate per genome length does not depend on @xmath39 .",
    "in other words , the dependence on @xmath39 seems to be responsible for the lack of scaling in eq.([mu ] ) when mutations are implemented as in the discrete version of the penna model .    on the other hand ,",
    "further scaling properties can be found in the solutions of the evolution equations , provided the poisson mutation protocol is used , as we show in the next section .",
    "to have further insight of what happens we shall consider explicit solutions to the evolution equations .",
    "from now on we shall consider only poisson mutation protocol .",
    "we first rewrite eq.([bir1 ] ) for the newborn offspring using eq.([sols ] ) for the orthodox evolution : @xmath88 \\;\\ ;   f(m , m ' ) \\;\\ ; x(0,m ' )   \\ .\\ ] ] we observe next that @xmath89 has dimensions of time@xmath90 , @xmath69 , @xmath80 , and @xmath22 have dimensions of time@xmath52 , while @xmath16 , @xmath7 , and @xmath15 have dimensions of time@xmath91 and @xmath92 is dimensionless .",
    "we can take @xmath54 as the time unit and rewrite all equations in dimensionless variables , which is equivalent to rewrite all equations setting @xmath93 and reading all quantities as given in time unities of @xmath54 .",
    "we then have one less parameter , and we remark that reading @xmath80 in units of @xmath51 links the mutation rate @xmath80 to the exponential constant of time evolution .    even with one less parameter , eq.([bir2 ] ) is an integral equation , involving all newborn population and the birth matrix",
    ". we can solve this equation because @xmath22 is triangular , but we must find out the maximum possible value @xmath29 for the death age that any stationary solution may present .",
    "we do this in an analogous fashion to that used for the discrete version of the model @xcite .",
    "we assume that there is a maximum death age @xmath34 in the population .",
    "as @xmath22 is triangular - there are only bad mutations - as time proceeds this maximum value can not increase , although too long living individuals may disappear .",
    "offspring with death age equal to @xmath34 can be produced only by @xmath34parents . using eq.([pois ] ) , the newborn equation for @xmath94 can be written as @xmath95 \\;\\ ; \\exp{(-pm^ * ) } \\;\\ ;   x(0,m^ * ) \\ .\\ ] ] the trivial solution , @xmath96 , is always possible .",
    "a nontrivial solution , @xmath97 , is possible if two conditions are met .",

    "the equivalent equations to be solved have the same form as eqs.([cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) with @xmath92 replaced by @xmath102 , and the corresponding limit for the maximum life span in a given population is @xmath103 a limit for the life span of a population means that if , at initial times , the maximum life span in the population is @xmath104 , in the stationary solution the population goes to a state where @xmath105 .",
    "but if initially @xmath106 , the population remains with that maximum life span , since in this model only bad mutations are allowed to happen . for each possible @xmath34 ( @xmath107 )",
    "the total population @xmath92 may be obtained from eq.([cond1 ] ) or from its analogue for respectively orthodox or volterra evolutions .",
    "@xmath29 is the largest value of @xmath34 that satisfies both conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) or their analogues .",
    "these two limits for the maximum life span for different evolution protocols depend differently on the value of the total population .",
    "we can observe some scaling properties regarding the maximum possible life span @xmath29 and total population @xmath92 . if we have , for every @xmath108 , @xmath109 then for the orthodox evolution @xmath110 on the other hand , for the volterra description the total population scaling is different : @xmath111 and the relation between population densities @xmath89 and @xmath112 is far from trivial : @xmath113    we note that for both evolutions the value of maximum life span does not depend on @xmath76 . hence varying the number of harmful diseases that the individuals may tolerate will not change the maximum life span , although it can change the survival rate for @xmath114 .",
    "the reason is that both conditions stated in eqs .",
    "( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) are generated by the first term in the expression for the birth matrix , eq.([pois ] ) , that gives the probability for a child with the same death age as its parent .",
    "this term depends only on the parent death age , and not on the number of diseases that there are in the parent genome before @xmath23 .",
    "this is also in agreement with the fact that the increasingly better medical care has increased human life expectancy but has not equally changed the maximum life span @xcite . in the penna model",
    "the effect of proper medical care is equivalent to a shift of the maximum number @xmath76 of genetically programmed diseases that an individual may endure@xcite . in fig.([mmaxvsp ] ) the plots of maximum life span and total population as functions of mutation probability @xmath80 for different values of fecundity @xmath69 . the maximum life span decreases with increasing @xmath80 and decreasing @xmath69 .       to fully appreciate the scaling present in the solutions we must solve eq.([bir2 ] ) . for that we first transform the integral equation into a differential one .",
    "consider a stationary population with @xmath105 , then for @xmath115 the birth equation can be rewritten as @xmath116 where @xmath117 is defined as @xmath118 such that , after some calculations we can write @xmath119 we now rewrite eq.([bir3 ] ) as @xmath120 we then differentiate @xmath76 times both sides , and use the fact that we can calculate the value of @xmath121 and all its derivatives at @xmath82 .",
    "we then arrive to the following differential equation : @xmath122 this equation may be numerically solved . to obtain the analogue of the above equation for the volterra evolution it suffices to replace @xmath92 by @xmath123 .",
    "nevertheless , in what follows we will consider only the orthodox evolution .",
    "version of the penna model , where scaling may not be found due to the somewhat artificial dependence of the mutation rate on the length of the genome . a second mutation protocol considers a poisson probability distribution , with mutations occurring with a fixed probability @xmath80 per unit of genome length . as this last mutation protocol",
    "does not depend on the genome length , the whole set of stationary solutions does not depend on @xmath39 .",
    "morever , in the special case of the orthodox time evolution and poisson mutation protocol , we could find further scaling relations such that the initial reproduction age @xmath7 may be taken as the natural time unit of the system . in this sense , all rates , as mutation and birth rates , are renormalized in units of @xmath124 .",
    "one direct consequence of this scaling is the correlation between earlier initial reproduction age and earlier senescence , an effect that is due to the scaling inherent to the model that shows up in the stationary solutions of the population dynamics equations .",
    "that is , here demographic effects only are responsible for this correlation and antagonistic pleiotropy effects are not needed .",
    "the generalization of sexual version of the penna model is now under investigation and shall appear elsewhere .",
