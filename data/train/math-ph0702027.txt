    "much work has been done on spin related transport properties of nanoelectronic devices resulting in interesting applications , for example the so called spin field effect transistor proposed by datta and das @xcite .",
    "there has been particular interest in using the rashba effect to manipulate the spin degree of freedom in such systems @xcite . in this paper",
    "we model a simple system exhibiting the rashba effect , viz . a ring with rashba hamiltonian attached to an arbitrary number of ` free ' wires , using so called solvable models @xcite .",
    "this means that we approximate the system by a ",
    "one dimensional ",
    "graph on which is defined an appropriate self adjoint schrdinger operator .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that , as the name suggests , it allows us to get explicit expressions for the scattering matrix , and hence for the transport properties of the system , in this case in terms of the greens function of the ring and the boundary conditions at the vertices .",
    "+ our particular interest in considering this model is to investgate the possibility of constructing a spin filter .",
    "various approaches have been taken to filter spin : we mention @xcite in which the authors construct a spin filter using a four terminal device with the rashba effect as well as @xcite where the authors achieve spin filtering using a two terminal device and a magnetic field .",
    "a third approach , discussed in @xcite , uses a three terminal device with the rashba effect and to some extent was the motivation for this paper .",
    "+ it is known that a device with two terminals and time reversal symmetry can not polarise spin currents @xcite ( the device in @xcite does not have time reversal invariance due to the magnetic field ) .",
    "nevertheless , kiselev and kim @xcite show that a three terminal device with time reversal symmetry and a particular geometric symmetry can make an effective spin filter .",
    "we consider the same geometry as considered in @xcite , viz . a ring with three wires and symmetry with respect to reflection across the line defined by the ` incoming ' wire .",
    "whereas kiselev and kim assume the rashba effect is localised at the ` incoming ' terminal in our model the rashba hamiltonian is present uniformly on the whole ring .",
    "kiselev and kim use a sophisticated numerical model of the system to calculate transport properties while our model is of course solvable .",
    "+ we believe that the formalism of solvable models offers , in general , advantages over numerical studies in that it allows us to derive explicit expressions for scattering properties thereby identifying principal features of the system .",
    "ideally , these may be used to help optimise the design ( for instance for spin filtering ) . in particular , for the three terminal device described above we investigate how the polarisation is related to the resonant eigenvalues on the ring , the rashba coefficient and the angle of attachment of the wires .",
    "we observe , as did kiselev and kim , that this system may be used as an efficient spin filter .",
    "we consider a ring shaped quantum waveguide where the width of the waveguide and the incident electron energy is such that the ring may be considered one - dimensional .",
    "furthermore , we assume that there is structural inversion asymmetry @xcite so that a rashba term appears in the hamiltonian on the ring . normalising the radius to one",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the hamiltonian has the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 @xmath2 is the local coordinate on the ring ; @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 denote the pauli spin matrices and the unit matrix respectively ; and @xmath7 describes the strength of the rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the solutions of the eigenequation , @xmath8 , are @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the eigenvalues on the ring @xmath13 correspond to the zeroes of @xmath14 .",
    "each eigenvalue @xmath15 has multiplicity two , the corresponding eigenspace is spanned by @xmath16 where @xmath17 since @xmath18 and @xmath19 we assume @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 . finally , we note that the twofold degeneracy of the eigenvalues drops to a fourfold degeneracy when @xmath24 . in this case",
    "we see that @xmath25 .",
    "+ mostly we will write eigenfunctions with both spin eigenstates together in a @xmath26 matrix in order to simplify notation .",
    "in particular the solutions @xmath27 may be used to find the greens function , ie .",
    "the continuous solution of @xmath28 which is in fact @xmath29 \\frac{e^{-i\\sigma_{y } \\varphi/2 } } { 2 i ( \\kappa_{+ } + \\kappa_{- } ) } e^ { i\\sigma_{z }   \\eta/2}\\ , \\sigma_{z } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac { e^{-i\\sigma_{z } \\theta /2}\\ , e^{-i\\sigma_{y } \\varphi/2 } } { 2 i ( \\kappa_{+ } + \\kappa_{- } ) } \\left [   \\frac { e^ { i\\sigma_{z } \\kappa_{+ } \\left ( \\theta - \\eta - \\pi \\right ) } } { \\cos ( \\kappa_{+ } \\pi ) } - \\frac { e^ { -i\\sigma_{z } \\kappa_{- } \\left ( \\theta - \\eta - \\pi \\right ) } } { \\cos ( \\kappa_{- } \\pi ) } \\right ] e^{-i\\sigma_{y } \\varphi/2 } e^ { i\\sigma_{z }   \\eta/2}\\ , \\sigma_{z } \\ , . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we take @xmath30 . + we assume that the ring is attached to @xmath31 semi - infinite wires .",
    "on each wire we have a ` free ' hamiltonian @xmath32 with generalised eigenfunctions @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the index for the wire and @xmath35 is the coordinate on the respective wire . + we write the hamiltonian on the whole system @xmath36 and consider this as an operator on the hilbert space @xmath37 of spinor valued functions on the graph @xmath38 consisting of the ring @xmath39 with @xmath31 wires @xmath40 attached . to define this as a self adjoint operator we need to correctly define the domain of @xmath41 which is related to self adjoint boundary conditions arising from the vanishing of the boundary form @xmath42 generally these boundary conditions are parameterised by a unitary matrix , for details see @xcite . here",
    "@xmath43 is the inner product on @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the inner product on spinors and @xmath46 are the points where the wires are attached to the ring .",
    "+ we always assume that each vertex has three incident edges , ie .",
    "no two wires are attached at the same point on the ring . for a given vertex",
    "we denote by @xmath47 the values of the eigenspinor on edge @xmath48 in the limit as we approach the vertex and by @xmath49 the values of the outward derivative on edge @xmath48 in the limit as we approach the vertex . in this paper",
    "we assume the following boundary conditions at the vertices @xmath50 motivated by the fact that they are closely related to the ansatz for the scattering matrix of the t - junction as described in the physics literature @xcite ( we describe this relationship in the first appendix ) . here",
    "edge @xmath51 is the semi - infinite wire while edges @xmath52 are on the ring .",
    "the coefficient @xmath53 describes the strength of the coupling between the wire and the ring .",
    "+ these boundary conditions ( [ bndcnd ] ) are assumed to hold with the same @xmath53 for each component of the spinor , ie .",
    "the coupling is independent of spin .",
    "however , @xmath53 may in general be different at each vertex or point where a wire is attached to the ring .",
    "it is clear that these boundary conditions are self - adjoint , ie .",
    "( [ bform ] ) vanishes ( see @xcite for a discussion of boundary conditions in the presence of magnetic terms ) .",
    "the scattered waves @xmath54 are eigenfunctions on the quantum graph satisfying the boundary conditions at the vertices and having the following form on the wires : @xmath55 we reiterate that @xmath54 corresponds to two spinor valued waves , one with spin up and one with spin down incident waves .",
    "similarly , the components of the scattering matrix @xmath56 , @xmath57 , are @xmath26 matrix valued . due to the nature of the boundary conditions we can define the scattered wave on the ring as @xmath58 where @xmath59",
    ", @xmath60 are the points where the wires are attached to the ring and @xmath61 is a matrix of coefficients .",
    "+ the boundary conditions for the scattered waves can be neatly expressed using the greens function . defining @xmath62 we see from ( [ swwires ] ) that on the wires @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes evaluation at the point where the @xmath65-th wire is attached to the ring and @xmath66 should be interpreted as matrix with matrix valued components . likewise from ( [ swring ] ) we have @xmath67 on the ring where we have used the property of the derivative of the greens function .",
    "it is then easy to see that the boundary conditions in ( [ bndcnd ] ) can be written @xmath68 respectively where @xmath53 is a diagonal matrix containing the coupling strengths for the @xmath31 vertices . solving for the scattering matrix we get @xmath69 this result",
    "can be generalised , at least in principle , using the techniques described in @xcite to find the scattering matrix of a quantum graph consisting of @xmath31 semi - infinite wires attached to a compact graph consisting of @xmath70 rings with rashba term connected by edges of finite length .",
    "let us consider a a three terminal device with symmetry as illustrated in figure [ sfil ] , ie .",
    "the angle @xmath71 between the first and second and first and third wires the same .",
    "to be precise we also need that the coupling constants at vertices two and three are the same  in fact , for simplicity , we will set all of the coupling constants equal to one , @xmath72 .",
    "+ as was shown in @xcite a three terminal device with this symmetry can potentially act as a spin filter . specifically , for unpolarised current entering the first wire the polarisation of flux measured on wires two , @xmath73 , and three , @xmath74 , along the @xmath7-axis satisfies @xmath75 a proof of these statements , following @xcite but in the context of quantum graphs , is given in appendix 2 .",
    "+ appendix 3 contain an outline of the derivation of expressions for the conductance @xmath76 and the polarisation in the @xmath77-axis @xmath78 for current going from wire one to two for the device in figure [ sfil ] . in figures",
    "[ pi2][3pi4 ] we plot the conductance @xmath76 ( upper curve ) and @xmath78 ( lower curve ) against the energy @xmath79 . in these plots",
    "we assume @xmath80 ; there is no significant change in the form of the @xmath76 and @xmath78 curves with respect to @xmath7 apart from at the special values discussed below .",

    "+ it is clear from these plots that at some of the resonant energies , depending on the value of @xmath91 , this device would function as an efficient spin filter .",
    "our case @xmath83 , figure [ pi2 ] , most closely resembles the device considered in @xcite and we observe as did kiselev and kim that the polarisation is maximum at odd resonant eigenvalues and severely damped at even eigenvalues  an explanation in terms of interference effects is given in @xcite .",
    "however , for our device at @xmath83 the polarisation changes sign at the odd resonances indicating that this may not be an ideal parameter regime for spin filtering . clearly defined and isolated peaks can be found for instance at @xmath84 and we believe would be a better parameter regime for spin filtering .",
    "+ we remark that for @xmath81 , @xmath76 and @xmath78 are periodic repeating after @xmath92 resonances @xmath15 with zeroes in @xmath76 and @xmath78 at @xmath93 .",
    "it seems plausible that this behaviour can again be explained by spin interference and topological phase effects @xcite .",
    "+ finally , we observe from the expression for the polarisation @xmath78 , equation ( [ fap ] ) , the following behaviour as a function of the rashba coefficient @xmath7 .",
    "as noted above , for @xmath24 the eigenvalues on the ring become fourfold degenerate . for these values of @xmath7 , @xmath94 so that  see the expression for @xmath95 given after equation ( [ fap])@xmath96 and the polarisation is _ identically zero_. this is clearly a generalisation of the degenerate behaviour at @xmath97 , a possible physical explanation involves noting that there is an integral number of effective flux quanta @xcite through the ring for these values of @xmath7 and showing that for integral quanta the spin interaction is cancelled .",
    "we rather consider the gauge transformation @xmath98 on the ring where @xmath99 . here",
    ", since @xmath100 is not single valued , we take @xmath101 and assume that the point of attachment @xmath102 .",
    "we also make a change of basis on the wires , formally @xmath103 .",
    "generally this results in all spin interaction being concentrated at the boundary conditions ; however , for @xmath24 the boundary conditions remain spin independent so that , in analogy with @xmath97 , we have vanishing of the polarisation .",
    "precisely , at all vertices except @xmath104 the original boundary conditions ( [ bndcnd ] ) continue to hold while at the origin we get the new boundary conditions @xmath105 here edge @xmath51 is the semi - infinite wire , edge @xmath106 corresponds to @xmath107 , edge @xmath108 corresponds to @xmath109 on the ring and we recall that the above derivatives are in the outward direction from the vertex .",
    "these boundary conditions show that , up to an energy shift on the ring , the scattering properties of the ring fall into two classes depending on whether @xmath70 is even or odd indicating that the conductance is a periodic function of @xmath7 ( as observed in the case of a two terminal device in @xcite ) .",
    "the author has benefitted greatly from conversations with prof b.pavlov and dr u. zlicke .",
    "there is a well established description of the scattering matrix for the t - junction in the physics literature ( see @xcite , pg 173 , and @xcite ) . in this appendix",
    "we show how this anstz is related to the solvable models approach of specifying boundary conditions ( [ bndcnd ] ) at the vertex of the t - junction .",
    "+ we note that ( [ bndcnd ] ) are of ` projection type ' @xcite , ie .",
    "we can express these boundary conditions in the form @xmath110 where @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 @xmath114 are projections .",
    "now we suppose that the t - junction is at the point where three semi - infinite wires meet , instead of at the point of connection of one wire and a ring . as above",
    "we construct scattered waves for this non compact system and derive the scattering matrix which turns out to be @xcite @xmath115 this scattering matrix is the same as posited in @xcite for the t - junction ( a different ordering of the edges is used in the last two references ) motivating our choice of ( [ bndcnd ] ) for the boundary conditions .",
    "+ we note that , at least for the chosen boundary conditions ( [ bndcnd ] , [ bndcnd2 ] ) , scattering at the idealised t - junction is independent of energy .",
    "it is not difficult to see that this is true for any projection type boundary condition and furthermore means that there are no discrete eigenvalues or resonances associated to the junction ( this is an equivalence @xcite , there are no discrete eigenvalues or resonances associated to the junction iff the boundary conditions are of projection type )",
    ". we also note that projection type boundary conditions , also referred to in the degree two case as flp - tsutsui point interactions , are important in the study of ` quantum chaotic ' behavior in quantum graphs @xcite due to their scale invariance .",
    "+ given a two or three dimensional quantum network , the problem of deriving appropriate boundary conditions at the vertices of an approximating one dimensional quantum graph is an active area of research ( see @xcite ) as is the ` inverse problem ' of constructing sequences of graphs with regular potentials so that in the limit we observe a chosen boundary condition from the whole @xmath116 parameter space @xcite .",
    "here we follow the argument of @xcite , which describes the symmetries of the scattering matrix , using terms appropriate for quantum graphs .",
    "+ we think of @xmath38 as a graph in the plane and suppose that @xmath117 is a closed curve nowhere tangent to @xmath38 .",
    "the wronskian is defined as @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 is the orientation of the ordered pair formed of the orientation of the local variable at @xmath121 and the orientation of @xmath117 at @xmath121 .",
    "the operator @xmath122 is one of @xmath123 or @xmath124 depending on whether @xmath121 is on the ring or the wires .",
    "+ we always assume that the wronskian acts on solutions of the eigenequation , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , from which it is easy to see that @xmath127 is piecewise constant .",
    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath117 is large , in particular it encloses and has no intersections with the ring , in which case we drop the subscript and write @xmath128 from the constancy of the wronskian we see that on the ring @xmath129 while on the wires @xmath130 so that @xmath131 is actually equal to the boundary form ( [ bform ] ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath132 and @xmath133 are eigensolutions satisfying the boundary conditions , ie . such that the boundary form ( [ bform ] ) vanishes , then @xmath134 ( in fact since our boundary conditions are ` local ' we will have @xmath135 for any @xmath117 , but we do not need this . ) + the wronskian allows us to identify symmetries of the scattering matrix .",
    "consider the wronskian of two scattered waves : @xmath136 we get immediately @xmath137 we note that in this case , since @xmath54 is matrix valued , the wronskian @xmath138 is properly thought of as a @xmath26 matrix .",
    "+ further symmetries of the scattering matrix may be found from operators commuting with the hamiltonian .",
    "here we are mainly interested in the case where the graph , and boundary conditions , are invariant with respect to a reflection in one of the coordinate axes @xmath139 .",
    "it is then clear that the hamiltonian will commute with @xmath140 and we have the vanishing of the wronskian @xmath141 or @xmath142 here @xmath143 is block diagonal with @xmath4 on the diagonal .",
    "+ before we apply this we need to define some notation .",
    "it is convenient for us to decompose the components of the scattering matrix in terms of spin matrices @xmath144 in terms of this decomposition we can express the conductance @xmath145 and the polarisation in the @xmath7-axis @xmath146 for waves going from wire @xmath65 to wire @xmath48 as @xmath147 now we consider the three terminal device illustrated in figure [ sfil ] which is clearly invariant with respect to @xmath148",
    ". then ( [ rsym ] ) implies @xmath149 where @xmath150 . in particular ,",
    "the polarisation satisfies @xmath151 finally we note that for the system under consideration the time reversal operator @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is complex conjugation , along with @xmath154 , where @xmath155 reverses the sign of @xmath7 or equivalently @xmath156 , both commute with the hamiltonian . proceeding as above these can be used to find yet more symmetries of the scattering matrix ( see @xcite for a further discussion ) .",
    "using equations ( [ gfn ] , [ smatrix ] ) we see that we can express the scattering matrix for the device illustrated in figure [ sfil ] as @xmath157 where @xmath158 @xmath159 , @xmath160 and we have assumed that all of the coupling constants are equal , @xmath161 . + from the form of the scattering matrix",
    "we see that @xmath162 where , using maple , @xmath163 and , due to the form of @xmath164 , the determinant @xmath165 is a complex scalar . + it is easy to show that the terms due to @xmath166 in the expression for @xmath167 make no contribution to the conductance , equation ( [ flux ] ) , @xmath168 and introduce a multiplicative factor into the polarisation in the @xmath77-axis , equation ( [ pol ] ) , @xmath169 using ( [ s1sz ] ) we write @xmath170 and @xmath171 in terms of @xmath172 and @xmath173 ( here again the form of @xmath172 is important ) which gives us @xmath174 and @xmath175 we again use maple to get explicit expressions and simplify  here it is important to cancel common factors @xmath176 which appear in the numerator and denominator to aid simplification and avoid numerical instability . at this step",
