    "modern cosmology demands the existence of two new components to the energy budget of the universe .",
    "dark matter is necessary for structure formation to occur properly , and to account for numerous observations , such as gravitational lensing , the comic microwave background ( cmb ) and galaxy rotation curves .",
    "the discovery of cosmic acceleration requires a second source of new physics , which may come in the form of a modification to general relativity , but which is perfectly consistent with a cosmological constant or a dynamical dark energy component  ( for reviews see  @xcite ) .    at a phenomenological level , this description is a remarkable fit to all current observations .",
    "however , at the level of fundamental physics the existence of dark matter and dark energy , comprising the vast majority of the contents of the universe , poses a critical challenge : how do these components fit into our microphysical theories of matter and energy ?",
    "one way to search for such relationships is to explore observable consequences of interactions between dark components and baryonic matter .",
    "examples of this are the search for the annihilation products of dark matter and collider searches for dark matter",
    ".    alternatively , if dark matter and dark energy are to fit into a unified description , we might expect  @xcite that there would also be interactions between them . in this talk",
    "i briefly explored some consequences of such interactions , focusing on a possible catastrophic instability - the _ adiabatic instability _ - and a number of constraints on stable models . as with all proceedings with page limits , thorough referencing is impossible , and i have therefore referenced mostly review articles , and the papers i actually referred to in the talk .",
    "i ll focus on the following action , encapsulating many models studied in the literature  @xcite , s[g_ab,,_j ] & = & d^4x + & & + _ j s_j[e^2 _ j ( ) g _ , _ j ]  , [ action0 ] where @xmath0 is the einstein frame metric , @xmath1 is a scalar field which acts as dark energy , and @xmath2 are the matter fields .",
    "the signature is @xmath3 and i define the reduced planck mass by @xmath4 .",
    "the functions @xmath5 are couplings to the j@xmath6 matter sector .",
    "the field equations following from this are ^2 g _ & = & _ _ - g _ ( ) ^2 - v ( ) g _ + & & + _ j e^4 _ j ( )  , [ ee0d ] _",

    "let us neglect baryons , and consider a composite dark matter sector , with one coupled species with density @xmath12 and coupling @xmath13 , and another uncoupled species with density @xmath14 and coupling @xmath15 . since these both represent types of dark matter @xmath16 , and it is convenient to set @xmath17 to yield ^2 g _",

    "the resulting minimum allows for the possibility of an adiabatic regime.,width=288 ]    in this case the coupled cdm component with @xmath1 together acts as a single fluid with an effective energy density _",
    "eff(_c ) = e^ + v[_m(_c ) ]  , [ rhoeff ] and effective pressure p_eff(_c ) = - v[_m(_c ) ]  .",

    "the coupled fluid acts as the source of cosmic acceleration , and in the adiabatic approximation the effective fluid description is valid for the background cosmology and for linear and nonlinear perturbations",
    ". therefore , the equation of state of perturbations is the same as that of the background cosmology , and the matter and scalar field evolve as one effective fluid , obeying the usual fluid equations of motion with the given effective equation of state .",
    "a necessary condition for the validity of the adiabatic approximation is that the lengthscales or timescales @xmath28 over which the density @xmath12 varies are large compared to inverse of the effective mass of the scalar field .",
    "a more precise condition can be shown to be  @xcite ( ) 1  .",
    "[ condt1 ] this condition justifies dropping terms involving the gradient of @xmath1 from the fluid and einstein equations .",
    "many dark energy models admit regimes in which this condition is satisfied for the background and for linearized perturbations over a range of scales .    in the adiabatic regime ,",
    "the inferred dark energy equation of state parameter ( neglecting baryons ) is w =  , with @xmath29 the value today .",
    "thus , @xmath30 is precisely @xmath31 today , and generically satisfies @xmath32 in the past  @xcite",
    "the potential @xmath33 may be written as a function @xmath34 of the coupling function @xmath24 by eliminating @xmath1 .",

    "we require @xmath41 .",
    "the negative sound speed squared will cause an exponential growth of the mode , as long as the growth timescale @xmath42 is short compared to the local gravitational timescale @xmath43 . since @xmath44 , the instability will operate in the range of lengthscales given by .",
    "[ range ] here the quantity @xmath45 on the right hand side is expressed as a function of @xmath1 using @xmath46 , and then as a function of the density using @xmath47 . in order for this range of scales to be non empty",
    ", the dimensionless coupling @xmath48 must be large compared to unity , i.e. , the scalar mediated interaction between the dark matter particles must be strong compared to gravity ( see also  @xcite .",
    "there are two different ways of describing and understanding the instability , depending on whether one thinks of the scalar - field mediated forces as `` gravitational '' or `` pressure '' forces .    in the einstein frame ,",
    "the instability is independent of gravity , since it is present even when the metric perturbation due to the fluid can be neglected . in the adiabatic regime the acceleration due the scalar field is a gradient of a local function of the density , which can be thought of as a pressure .",
    "the net effect of the scalar interaction is to give a contribution to the specific enthalpy @xmath49 of any fluid which is independent of the composition of the fluid .",
    "if the net sound speed squared of the fluid is negative , then there exists an instability in accord with our usual hydrodynamic intuition .    on the other hand , in the jordan frame description",
    ", the instability most certainly involves gravity .",
    "the effective newton s constant describing the interaction of dark matter with itself is g_cc = g , [ gformula0 ] where @xmath50 is a spatial wavevector @xcite . at",
    "long lengthscales the scalar interaction is suppressed and @xmath51 . at short lengthscales , the scalar field is effectively massless and @xmath52 asymptotes to a constant .",
    "however , when @xmath53 there is an intermediate range m_eff(|^|)^-1 k m_eff [ range3 ] over which the effective newton s constant increases like @xmath54 .",
    "this interaction behaves just like a ( negative ) pressure in the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "this explains why the the effect of the scalar interaction can be thought of as either pressure or gravity in the range of scales ( [ range3 ] ) .",
    "note that the range of scales ( [ range3 ] ) coincides with with the range ( [ range ] ) derived above , up to a logarithmic correction factor .    from this second , jordan - frame point of view ,",
    "the instability is simply a jeans instability . in a cosmological background",
    "the cdm fractional density perturbation traditionally exhibits power - law growth on subhorizon scales because hubble damping competes with the exponential ( jeans ) instability one might expect on a timescale of @xmath55 . in our case , however , the gravitational self - interaction of the mode is governed by @xmath56 instead of @xmath57 , and consequently in the range ( [ range3 ] ) where @xmath58 the timescale for the jeans instability is much shorter than the hubble damping time .",
    "therefore the hubble damping is ineffective and the jeans instability causes approximately exponential growth .",

    "the effective potential is v_eff ( , ) = v_0 e^-/ + e^-c /  , and solving for the local minimum of this potential yields the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath25 in the adiabatic regime : e^(-c ) _",
