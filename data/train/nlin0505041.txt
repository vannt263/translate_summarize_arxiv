    "the recent few years have witnessed a great development in physics community to explore and characterize the underlying laws of complex networks , including as diverse as the internet @xcite , the world - wide web @xcite , the scientific collaboration networks ( scn ) @xcite , and world - wide airport networks ( wan)@xcite .",
    "many empirical measurements have uncovered some general scale - free properties of those real systems , which motivated a wealth of theoretical efforts devoted to the characterization and modelling of them . since barabsi and albert introduced their seminal ba model , most efforts have been contributed to study the network topological properties @xcite .",
    "however , networks as well known are far from boolean structures , and the purely topological representation of them will miss important attributes often encountered in real world .",
    "for instance , the amount of traffic characterizing the connections of communication systems or large transport infrastructure is fundamental for a full description of them @xcite .",
    "more recent years , the availability of more complete empirical data and higher computation ability permit scientists to consider the variation of the connection strengths that indeed contain the physical features of many real graphs .",
    "weighted networks can be described by a weighted adjacency @xmath2 matrix , with element @xmath3 denoting the weight on the edge connecting vertices @xmath4 and @xmath5 . as a note",
    ", this paper will only consider undirected graphs where weights are symmetric .",
    "as confirmed by measurements , complex networks often exhibit a scale - free degree distribution @xmath6 with 2@xmath73 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the weight distribution @xmath8 is also found to be heavy tailed in some real systems @xcite . as a generalization of connectivity @xmath9 ,",
    "the vertex strength is defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the set of @xmath4 s neighbors .",
    "this quantity is a natural measure of the importance or centrality of a vertex in the network .",
    "for instance , the strength in wan provides the actual traffic going through a vertex and is obvious measure of the size and importance of each airport . for the scn ,",
    "the strength is a measure of scientific productivity since it is equal to the total number of publications of any given scientist .",
    "empirical evidence indicates that in most cases the strength distribution has a fat tail @xcite , similar to that of degree distribution .",
    "highly correlated with the degree , the strength usually displays scale - free property @xmath12 with @xmath13 @xcite . driven by new empirical findings , alain barrat",
    "_ et al . _ have presented a simple model ( bbv for short ) that integrates the topology and weight dynamical evolution to study the dynamical evolution of weighted networks @xcite .",
    "an obvious virtue of their model is its general simplicity in both mechanisms and mathematics .",
    "thus it can be used as a starting point for further generalizations .",
    "it successfully yields scale - free properties of the degree , weight and strength , just depending on one parameter @xmath14 that controls the local dynamics between topology and weights .",
    "inspired by bbv s work , a class of evolving models will be presented in this paper to describe and study specific weighted networks . this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we will introduce a traffic - driven model to mimic the weighted technological networks .",
    "analytical calculations are in consistent with numerical results . in section iii , a neighbor - connected model is proposed to study social networks of collaboration , with the comparison of simulations and theoretical prediction as well . at the end of each section",
    ", we discuss the differences between the bbv model and ours , from the microscopic mechanisms to observed macroscopic properties .",
    "we conclude our paper by a brief review and outlook in section iv .",
    "the network provides the substrate on which numerous dynamical processes occur .",
    "technology networks provide large empirical database that simultaneously captures the topology and the traffic dynamics taking place on it .",
    "we argue that traffic and its dynamics is a key role for the understanding of technological networks . for internet , the information flow between routers ( nodes )",
    "can be represented by the corresponding edge weight .",
    "the total ( incoming and outgoing ) information that each router deals with can be denoted by the node strength , which also represents the importance or load of given router .",
    "our traffic - driven model starts from an initial configuration of @xmath15 vertices fully connected by links with assigned weight @xmath16 .",
    "the model is defined on two coupled mechanisms : the topological growth and the increasing traffic dynamics :    _ ( i ) topological growth .",
    "_ at each time step , a new vertex is added with @xmath17 edges connected to @xmath17 previously existing vertices ( we hence require @xmath18 ) , choosing preferentially nodes with large strength ; i.e. a node @xmath4 is chosen by the new according to the strength preferential probability : @xmath19the weight of each new edge is also fixed to @xmath20 . this strength preferential mechanism",
    "have simple physical and realistic interpretations in ref .",
    "@xcite .    _",
    "( ii ) traffic dynamics .",
    "_ from the start of the network growing , traffic in all the sites are supposed to constantly increase , with probability proportional to the node strength @xmath21 per step .",
    "we assume the growing speed of the network s total traffic as a discrete constant @xmath22 ( each unit can be considered as an information packet in the case of internet ) .",
    "then in statistic sense the newly created traffic in site @xmath4 per step is @xmath23these newly - added packets will be sent out from @xmath4 to their separate destinations .",
    "our model does not care their specific destinations or delivering paths , but simply suppose that each new packet preferentially takes the route - way with larger edge weight ( data bandwidth of links ) , i.e. with the probability @xmath24 , and it hence will increase the traffic ( strength ) in the corresponding neighbor @xmath5 of node @xmath4 .",
    "it is a plausible mechanism in many real - world webs .",
    "for instance , in the case of the airport networks , the potential passenger traffic in larger airports ( with larger strength , often located in important cities ) will be usually greater than that in smaller airports , and busy airlines often get busier in development . for internet , routers that have larger traffic handling capabilities are responsible to deal with more information packets .",
    "also , the route - ways with broader data bandwidth will get busier . admittedly , this ",
    "busy get busier \" scenario is intuitive in physics , though perhaps not strict in mathematics .",
    "the model time is measured with respect to the number of nodes added to the graph , i.e. @xmath25 , and the natural time scale of the model dynamics is the network size @xmath26 . in response to the demand of increasing traffic , the systems must expand in topology . with a given size",
    ", one technological network assumably has a certain ability to handle certain traffic load .",
    "therefore , it could be reasonable to suppose for simplicity that the total weight on the networks increases synchronously by the natural time scale .",
    "that is why we assume @xmath22 as a constant .",
    "this assumption also bring us the convenience of analytical discussion @xcite . by using the continuous approximation",
    ", we can treat @xmath27 and the time @xmath28 as continuous variables .",
    "the time evolution of the weights @xmath3 can be computed analytically as follows : @xmath29 the term @xmath30 represents the contribution to weight @xmath3 from site @xmath4 . considering @xmath31one can rewrite the above evolution equation as : @xmath32    the link ( i , j ) is created at @xmath33 with initial condition @xmath34 , so that @xmath35 further , we can obtain the evolution equations for @xmath36 and @xmath37 : @xmath38and @xmath39these equations can be readily integrated with initial conditions @xmath40 , yielding @xmath41the strength and degree of vertices are thus related by the following expression @xmath42 in order to check the analytical predictions , we performed numerical simulations of networks created by the present model with various values of @xmath22 and minimum degree @xmath17 . in fig . 1 , we report the average strength @xmath43 of vertices with connectivity @xmath9 and confirm the validity of eq .

    "the distribution is gradually broader with @xmath54 when @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath56 and @xmath57 are proportional , one can expect the same behavior of degree distribution @xmath58 .",

    "further information can be gathered by inspecting the average clustering coefficient @xmath71 restricted to classes of vertices with degree @xmath57 : @xmath72 in many networks , @xmath73 exhibits a power - law decay as a function of @xmath57 , indicating that low - degree nodes generally belong to well interconnected communities ( high clustering coefficient ) while high - degree sites are linked to many nodes that may belong to different groups which are not directly connected ( small clustering coefficient ) .",
    "this is generally the signature of a nontrivial architecture in which hubs ( high degree vertices ) play a distinct role in the network .",
    "correlations can be probed by inspecting the average degree of the nearest neighbors of a vertex @xmath4 , that is , @xmath74 . averaging this quantity over nodes with the same degree @xmath57 leads to a convenient measure to investigate the behavior of the degree correlation function @xmath75 if degrees of neighboring vertices are uncorrelated",

    "when correlations are present , two main classes of possible correlations have been identified : _ assortative _ behavior if @xmath78 increases with @xmath57 , which indicates that large degree vertices are preferentially connected with other large degree vertices , and _ disassortative _ if @xmath78 decreases with @xmath57 .",

    ", the model also exhibits properties which are depending on the basic parameter @xmath22 .",
    "more precisely , for small @xmath22 , the clustering coefficient of the network is small and @xmath73 is flat . as @xmath22 increases however , the global clustering coefficient increases and @xmath73 becomes a power - law decay similar to real network data @xcite .",
    "4 shows that the increase in clustering is determined by low - degree vertices .",
    "the average clustering coefficient @xmath0 is found to be a function of @xmath22 , as shown in its inset .",
    "this numerical result obviously demonstrates the important effect of traffic on the hierarchical structure of technological networks .",
    "analogous properties are obtained for the degree correlation spectrum . for small @xmath22 ,",
    "the average nearest neighbor degree @xmath78 is quite flat as in the ba model .",

    "the assortativity coefficient @xmath1 versus @xmath22 , as reported in the inset of fig .",
    "5 , demonstrates the tunable disassortative property of this model , which is supported by measurements in real technological networks @xcite .",
    "the qualitative explanations of the correlations and clustering spectrum can be found in @xcite , and their theoretical analysis appears in @xcite . in sum , all the simulation results for clustering and degree correlation , as empirically observed , imply us that the increasing traffic may be the driven force to shape the hierarchical and organizational structure of real technological networks .      one may notice that if the parameter @xmath22 is replaced by @xmath88 , then the mathematical framework of our traffic - driven model is equivalent to that of bbv s @xcite , though the specific weights dynamics are quite different between the two . by comparison with @xmath89 ( that is , the fraction of weight which is locally  induced \" by the new edge onto the neighboring others ) ,",
    "the parameter @xmath90 in our model , with macroscopic perspectives , is the ratio of the total weight increment on the expanding structure ( w ) to the number of newly - established links ( m ) at each time step .",
    "it is an important measure for the relative growing speed of traffic vs. topology , and controls a series of the network scale - free properties .",
    "thus , there is an obvious difference between bbv model and ours : the former is based on the local rearrangement of weights induced by newly added links , while the latter is built upon the global traffic growth and the redistribution of weights according to the local nature of network .",
    "noticeably , the weight dynamical evolution of the bbv model is triggered only by newly added vertices , hardly resulting in satisfying interpretations to collaboration networks or the airport systems .",
    "for these two cases , even if the size of networks keeps invariant , co - authored papers will still come out and airports can become more crowded as well .",
    "in contrast , this difficulty for practical explanations naturally disappear in our model , due to its global weight dynamics .",
    "above all , the traffic - driven model here , without loss of simplicity and practical senses , has generalized bbv s work and narrowed its applicable scope to technological networks .",
    "based on it , more complicated variations of the microscopic rules may be implemented to better mimic technological networks .",
    "especially worth remarking is that the present empirical studies on airport networks and internet indicate the nonlinear degree - strength correlation @xmath91 with @xmath92 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , barrat _ et al .",
    "_ proposed the heterogeneous coupling mechanism to obtain this property .",
    "this is not difficult to introduce into the present traffic - driven version .",
    "moreover , we find that the nontrivial weight - topology correlation can also emerge from the accelerating growth of traffic weight @xcite or from the accelerating creation and reinforcement of internal edges @xcite .",
    "social networks are a paradigm of the complexity of human interactions , which have also attracted a great deal of attention within the statistical physics community .",
    "the study of social networks has been traditionally hindered by the small size of the networks considered and the difficulties in the process of data collection ( usually from questionnaires or interviews ) .",
    "more recently , however , the increasing availability of large databases has allowed scientists to study a particular class of social networks , the so - called collaboration networks .",
    "the co - authorship network of scientists represents a prototype of complex evolving networks , which can be defined in a clear way .",
    "their large size has allowed researchers to get a reliable statistical description of their topological and weight properties , and hence reach reliable conclusions of the network structure and dynamics . in weighted social networks , the edge weight between a pair of nodes can represent the tightness of their connection . the larger weight indicates the more frequency of interaction ; e.g. the number of co - authored papers between two scientists , the frequency of telephone or email contacts between two acquaintances , etc . in addition , it is more probable that two vertices with a common neighbor get connected than two vertices chosen at random .",
    "clearly , this property leads to a large average clustering coefficient since it increases the number of connections between the neighbors of a vertex .",
    "this is already observed in a model proposed by davidsen , ebel and bornhodt @xcite .",
    "our neighbor - connected model starts from an initial graph of @xmath15 vertices , fully connected by links with assigned weight @xmath16 .",
    "its evolution then is simply based on the dynamics of _ connecting nearest - neighbors _ : at each time step , a new vertex @xmath93 is added with one primary link and @xmath17 secondary links , which connect with @xmath94 existing vertices ( the initial network configuration hence requires @xmath95 ) .",
    "actually , the newly - built connections are not independent , but related with each other . the primary link ( @xmath16 )",
    "first preferentially attaches to an old node with large strength ;",
    "i.e. a node @xmath4 is connected by the primary link with probability @xmath96then , the @xmath17 secondary connections ( assigned @xmath16 each ) are preferentially built between the new vertex and @xmath17 neighbors of node @xmath4 , with the weight preferential probability @xmath97where @xmath98 .",
    "after building the primary link @xmath99 , the creation of every secondary link @xmath100 is assumed to introduce variations of network weights .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we limit ourselves to the case where the introduction of a primary link on node @xmath4 will trigger only local rearrangement of weights on the existing neighbors @xmath98 , according to the rule @xmath101 in general , @xmath102 depends on the local dynamics and can be a function of different parameters such as the weight @xmath3 , the degree or the strength of @xmath4 , etc . in the following ,",
    "we will simply focus on the case that @xmath103 .",
    "after the weights have been updated , the evolving process is iterated by introducing a new vertex until the desired size of the network is reached .",
    "the above mechanisms have simple physical and realistic interpretations .",
    "once a fresh member joins a social community , he will be introduced to his neighbors or take initiatives to interact with them .",
    "then , his social connections will soon be built within his neighborhood .",
    "it is reasonable that the entering of this new member can trigger the local variation of connections .",
    "take the scn for example , a scientist joining a research group will often collaborate with both the group director ( primary link ) and the other group members ( secondary links ) .",
    "the scientist s affiliation can naturally boost the research productivity of the group and also , enhance the collaborations of other members .",
    "the above scenario may be a best interpretation of the origin of our model parameter @xmath102 .",
    "we use @xmath102 to control the effect of the newly - introduced member on the weights of connections among the local neighbors . in the proceeding section",

    "first , in the bbv model the evolution and distributions of such quantities as strength , weight and degree are simply depending on the parameter @xmath89 which controls the coupling between local topology and weights . in our model , however , the evolution and distributions of those quantities are controlled by two parameters ( @xmath102 and @xmath17 , as reflected in theoretical part ) , which together determine the effect of the new node on the local weights and topology . though we have fixed @xmath17 in most simulations , the role of parameter @xmath17 should not be ignored . as fig . 9 reports",
    ", the curvature of @xmath73 is not sensitive to the variations of @xmath102 , but it nontrivially depends on @xmath17 as shown in fig .",
    "second , given the same minimum degree , the average clustering coefficient @xmath0 of our neighbor - connected model ( see the inset of fig .",
    "9 ) can be much larger than that of bbv s model or of our model a , because the secondary links in model b considerably increase the density of triangles within the system . compared with the original model , this larger clustering demonstrate an important advantage of model b in modelling the small - world property of real complex networks .",
    "one question arises from the inset of fig .",
    "10 : at first sight , it may be surprising to see that @xmath0 greatly decreases when increasing the secondary linking number @xmath17 .",
    "actually , larger @xmath17 in the model means larger minimum degree .",
    "when a new node arrives , the number of triangles in the system will increase by @xmath17 .",
    "but for a smallest - degree node @xmath4 , its clustering is @xmath120 where @xmath121 denotes the number of connected neighbors of node @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , increasing @xmath17 , we will decrease @xmath69 more greatly , resulting in the decaying of @xmath0 .",
    "admittedly , there still exists a common point which leads to the restriction of model b to mimic and interpret social networks .",
    "the degree correlations in both models are negative ( see the inset of fig .",
    "11 ) , indicating their disassortative mixing patten that is opposite in social networks .",
    "is it possible to find out a unified minimum model to characterize both the assortative and disassortative networks ?",
    "this question is very challenging and appears among the leading ones in front of network researchers @xcite .",
    "our recent studies may shed some new light on this tackling problem @xcite .",
    "anyway , the present neighbor - connected model ( though disassortative ) has maintained the simplicity of the bbv model and appears as a more specific version for weighted social networks , considering its larger clustering and clearer hierarchical structure .",
    "in this paper , we have presented and studied two evolving models for weighted complex networks . these two models intend to mimic technological networks and social graphs respectively , and can be regarded as a meaningful development of the original bbv model . though their specific evolution dynamics are different , all of them are found to bear similar mathematical structures and hence exhibit several common behaviors , e.g. the power - law distributions and evolution of degree , weight and strength . in each case",
    ", we also studied the nontrivial clustering coefficient @xmath0 and tunable degree assortativity @xmath1 as well as their degree - dependent correlations .",
    "in such context , we compared our generalized models with the original one , and got several interesting conclusions , which may provide us with a better understanding of the hierarchical and organizational architecture of weighted networks .",
    "for all the above reasons , we would like to classify these models into a class , within which the bbv s is the first one and may be the simplest one . it must be admitted that this class of models do not take into account the internal connections during the network evolution , which is yet beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "still , we hope that our generalized work can make this model family more diversified and help bring it some new sights .",
