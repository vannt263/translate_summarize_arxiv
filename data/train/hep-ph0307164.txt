    "the structure of pseudoscalar mesons , its mass spectra and decays have attracted a lot of interest along the years , an important motivation for this interest being certainly related to the fact that the origin of these mesons is related to the spontaneous or explicit breakdown of symmetries of qcd . furthermore , since at high densities and temperatures new phases with restored symmetries are expected to occur , the study of pseudoscalar meson observables under those conditions is specially relevant since they could provide signs for the phase transitions and the associated restoration of symmetries . as a matter of fact , major theoretical and experimental efforts have been dedicated to heavy  ion physics looking for signatures of the quark gluon plasma , a state of matter with deconfinement of quarks and restoration of symmetries @xcite .    in the limit of vanishing quark masses ,",
    "the qcd lagrangian has 8 goldstone bosons , associated with the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "the non inexistence of a ninth goldstone boson in qcd is explained by assuming that the qcd lagragian has a @xmath2 anomaly .",
    "the origin of the physical masses of the different pseudoscalar mesons is due to the explicit breaking of symmetries , but it presents differences that will be analyzed next . while for pions and kaons it is enough to break explicitly the chiral symmetry by giving current masses to the quarks , the breaking of the @xmath2 symmetry by instantons has the effect of giving a mass to @xmath3 of about @xmath4 gev .",
    "so the mass of @xmath3 has a different origin than the masses of the other pseudoscalar mesons and it can not be regarded as the remnant of a goldstone boson . concerning the other two neutral mesons , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , they are degenerated when the @xmath7 anomaly and the current quark masses are turned off , but , when these effects are taken into account it turns out that a percentage of @xmath5 mass is due to the anomaly , and , therefore , this meson should regarded as less `` goldstone  like '' than the pion . investigating",
    "this problem in vacuum and in medium is an important task . besides mass spectrum and meson  quark coupling constants , the observables associated with the two photon decay of these mesons might provide useful insight into this problem , and calculations of such observables in vacuum and at finite temperature may be found in the literature @xcite .    understanding the processes @xmath8 is specially relevant having in mind that the great percentage of photons in the background of heavy - ion collisions is due to the decay of @xmath9 @xcite . as a matter of fact the production of such mesons",
    "is indicated by the occurrence of two photon pairs with an invariant mass equal to these meson masses .",
    "possible medium modifications of anomalous mesonic interactions is a topic that has attracted lost of interest .",
    "as pointed by pisarski @xcite and pisarski and tytgat @xcite while for fermions the axial anomaly is not affected by the medium , the opposite is expected for anomalous mesonic interactions . in this concern ,",
    "the study of @xmath10 is particularly interesting due to its simplicity and its association with restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "although the lifetime of the neutral pion is much longer than hadronic time scales and it is not expected to be observed inside the fireball , the physics is the same as that of other anomalous decays ( @xmath11 ) that are relevant for experiments in the hot / dense region .",
    "a great deal of knowledge on chiral symmetry breaking and restoration , as well as on meson properties , comes from model calculations @xcite .",
    "in particular , the nambu  jona - lasinio [ njl ] @xcite type models have been extensively used over the past years to describe low energy features of hadrons and also to investigate restoration of chiral symmetry with temperature or density @xcite .",
    "this work comes in the sequel of previous studies on the behavior of neutral mesons in hot and dense matter @xcite .",
    "the study of phase transitions in quark matter simulating neutron matter in @xmath1 equilibrium , at zero and finite temperature , as well as the discussion of behavior of pseudoscalar mesons ( in particular neutral mesons ) in such media , in connection with the restoration of symmetries , has been done in @xcite , by analyzing only the mass spectrum . in particular",
    ", it was shown that the behavior of the masses of @xmath6 and @xmath5 in this concern reflects mainly the restoration of chiral @xmath12 symmetry and manifests strongly in the pion .",
    "this not so evident for the @xmath5 , due to its strangeness content and the dependence of the anomaly .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the anomalous decays of @xmath6 and @xmath5 in the vacuum and in quark matter in @xmath1 equilibrium and discuss our results in connection with the breaking and restoration of symmetries .",
    "we also compare our results with those obtained by other authors who studied the effect of temperature on these anomalous mesonic interactions @xcite .",

    ", this version of the njl model exhibits a first order phase transition @xcite . as shown in @xcite , by using a convenient parameterization @xcite the model may be interpreted as having a mixing phase  droplets of light @xmath135 quarks at a critical density @xmath136 ( where @xmath137@xmath138 is the nuclear matter density ) surrounded by a non  trivial vacuum  and , above this density , a quark phase with partially restored chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of quark matter in weak equilibrium is that at densities above @xmath139 the mass of the strange quark becomes lower than the chemical potential what implies the occurrence of strange quarks in this regime and this fact leads to meaningful effects on the behavior of meson observables @xcite .        in order to evaluate the transition amplitude of the decay @xmath140 in function of the density",

    "this behavior is essentially a manifestation of the partial restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "the difference between the behavior at @xmath143 and @xmath144 is that , in the last case the mesons are no more bound states above the critical point since they dissociate in @xmath145 pairs at the mott temperature . at finite density",
    "they continue to be bound states but with a weaker coupling to the quarks as it can be seen in fig .",
    "so , it is natural to expect that the effect of density on @xmath146 decay observables be qualitatively similar to the effect of finite temperature .",

    "3 a)-c ) . in order to understand this results",
    "let us remember the central role of this meson in connection with the breaking and restoration of chiral symmetry in the @xmath12 sector .",
    "a sign for the restoration of this symmetry is that the mass of the pion increases with density and this meson becomes degenerated with @xmath149 meson and the pion decay constant @xmath150 goes asymptotically to zero .",
    "the behavior of @xmath151 observables with density is closely related with the restoration of chiral symmetry in the @xmath12 sector .",
    "the fact that @xmath152 , as well as @xmath153 decrease with density reflects the fact that @xmath154 and @xmath155 decrease with density . as it can be seen from fig .",
    "2 , the quark mass decreases sharply while @xmath156 decreases more slowly . in the region",
    "@xmath157 the behavior of the transition amplitude is dictated by a compromise between the behavior of the mass and the meson quark coupling . above @xmath158",
    "the mass decrease seems to be the dominant effect .",
    "concerning @xmath159 it has a maximum at about the critical density , since there are two competitive effects , on one side the decrease of the transition amplitude and , on the other side , the increase of the pion mass . above the critical density the two photon decay of",
    "the pion becomes less favorable , what reflects that it turns a weaker bound @xmath145 pair , as already mentioned before .",
    "this is compatible with recent experimental results indicating that pionic degrees of freedom are less relevant at high densities @xcite .    in order to clarify the connection between the behavior of the anomalous couplings and the restoration of chiral symmetry one can do the simple exercise of calculating the transition amplitude in the chiral limit , by setting the external momenta equal to zero",
    "then , similarly to @xcite , where such analysis was done with temperature , we get @xmath160 , the mass decreases being the dominant effect , which leads to a vanishing of the transition amplitude at the critical density .      concerning the @xmath161 decay ,",
    "although qualitatively similar to @xmath151 , there are differences that we will examine in detail and that are related to the evolution of the strange quark content of this meson and the behavior of the strange quark in this regime .",
    "the quark content of @xmath5 is given by : @xmath162 in the vacuum ) decreases with density , has a minimum @xmath163 ) at @xmath164 , equals to zero at @xmath165 , then it increases rapidly up to the value @xmath166 , when strange valence quarks appear in the medium ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "@xmath168 ( fig .",
    "1-b ) reflects this evolution of the strange quark content .",
    "so , one sees that at high densities the @xmath5 is governed by the behavior of the strange quark mass . since after @xmath169 there is a tendency to the restoration of chiral symmetry in the strange sector ,",
    "although less pronounced then for non strange quarks , this effect should manifest itself in the behavior of @xmath5 observables .",
    "therefore , although the @xmath5 is less `` goldstone like '' than the pion , one expects results qualitatively similar for the two photon decay , which are shown in fig . 4 a)-c ) .",
    "the main difference is that the width @xmath170 almost vanishes above @xmath171 .",
    "this behavior of the @xmath5 seems to indicate that the role of the @xmath7anomaly for the mass of this meson at high densities is less important .    in conclusion",
    ", we studied the behavior of two photon decay observables for the neutral mesons @xmath6 and @xmath5 in quark matter in weak equilibrium and we discussed the results in connection with restoration of symmetries .",
    "we have shown that , in spite of the different quark structure of these mesons , at high densities they share a behavior which is mainly a manifestation of restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "we show that these anomalous decays are significantly affected by the medium , however the relevance of this results from the experimental point of view should be discussed .",
    "recent experimental results from phenix @xcite show that @xmath6 production is suppressed in the central region of au@xmath172au collisions as compared to the peripherical region .",
    "this means that @xmath151 decay could only be interesting for experimental heavy - ion collisions at intermediate densities .",
    "however , although the peak of the @xmath6 width is at a moderate density ( see fig .",
    "3 ) its life time , @xmath173 , is here of the order of @xmath174s , much longer than the expected lifetime of the fireball in the hadronic phase , @xmath175s , so the decay should occur outside of the fireball .",
    "the same considerations apply to the @xmath5 , although its maximum lifetime is @xmath176s .",
    "however , since the physics underlying these processes is the same of other anomalous processes interesting from the experimental point of view , the modification of anomalous mesonic interactions by the medium might , in principle , be observed .",
