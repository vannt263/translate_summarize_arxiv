    "] however , both quantum theory and probability theory are equipped with additional structures , which describe possible mappings of probabilities or quantum states . can these prescriptions of information dynamics also be directly related to each other ? in particular , there are various considerations @xcite of von neumann s and lders rules @xcite as noncommutative _ analogues _ of the bayes ",
    "laplace rule @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to ask whether this analogy could be turned to something more definite , both conceptually and mathematically .",
    "the main motivation for this paper is a series of results @xcite showing that both bayes  laplace and jeffrey s rules ( as well as some other rules @xcite ) can be derived as special cases of the constrained minimisation of various information distances on probabilistic models ( in section [ bayes.section ] we review briefly some of these results ) .",
    "this has led us to conjecture @xcite that lders rules may be special cases of constrained maximisation of a quantum relative entropy . in section [ vn.lu.section ]",
    "we prove that the weak lders rule of quantum state change due to `` nonselective quantum measurement '' is a special case of quantum entropic projection , provided by the minimisation of the araki distance subject to a specific set of constraints .",
    "we also introduce a quantum analogue of jeffrey s rule and derive it as another special case of constrained araki distance minimisation .",
    "these are the two main results of this paper .",
    "in addition , we show that the strong lders rule of quantum state change due to `` selective quantum measurement '' can be obtained from these results as the limiting case of quantum jeffrey s rule or by regularised araki distance minimisation . in section [ transition.correlation.section ]",
    "we show that both weak lders rule and strong von neumann s rule ( which is the same as strong lders rule for pure states ) are also quantum entropic projections for a different quantum distance functional . with an exception of a derivation of a quantum jeffrey s rule , our results hold for arbitrary @xmath0-algebras , so they are applicable in quantum field theoretic and relativistic quantum information problems .",
    "these results extend earlier considerations of lders rules as _ analogues _ of the bayes ",
    "laplace rule with a novel mathematical and conceptual content : all these rules are special cases of the constrained relative entropic inference . in this sense , ` quantum bayesianism ' can be considered a branch of ` quantum relative entropism ' .",

    "+ * history of the problem . * an inference based on minimisation of quantum distance on quantum models was first proposed by herbut @xcite .",
    "he derived the weak lders rule from a constrained minimisation of norm distance in the hilbert ",
    "schmidt operator space .",
    "unfortunately , his work has been left unnoticed by all works cited below .",
    "several years later marchand and collaborators @xcite used bures distance @xcite ( which is metrical ) , and argued that its constrained minimisation should be considered as a description of the change of state of information _ due to _ `` quantum measurement '' described by a specific form of a coarse graining map @xcite ( conditioned upon a subset of an operator algebra , and predual to a specific form of noncommutative conditional expectation @xcite ) .",
    "independently of this body of work , in @xcite it was proposed to use the constrained minimisation of the wgkl distance of probabilities arising from traces of density operators to derive the post - measurement quantum state . the rules of inferential change of quantum states based on a constrained minimisation of other metrical distances on quantum models were later reconsidered by other authors @xcite and some derivations of the strong von neumann rule were obtained ( see section [ transition.correlation.section ] ) .",
    "the reinterpretation of von neumann s and lders rules for `` quantum measurement '' as principles of inductive inference conditioned on specific information , and analogous to the bayes  laplace rule , was proposed at about the same time by bub @xcite ( however , it can be claimed @xcite , that already von neumann was aware of the possibility of such interpretation ) .",
    "these two lines of thought were ( implicitly ) joined in hadjisavvas @xcite postulate that a quantum state change due to acquisition of data ( e.g. in a measurement ) should be provided by means of constrained minimisation of the jmgk distance , as well as in donald s @xcite postulate that a description of `` quantum measurement '' , understood as an inductive inference , should be provided by means of constrained minimisation of the araki distance . at least for injective @xmath0-algebras @xmath1 . ]",
    "donald stressed also that this procedure @xcite , where @xmath2 is the constraint set .",
    "however , he provided no derivation of any of lders rules ( nor any other `` quantum measurement '' rules ) from this procedure .",
    "independently of the above works , warmuth @xcite used constrained minimisation of umegaki s distance to derive a generalisation of the bayes ",
    "laplace rule to the case of density operators , with conditional probabilities replaced by covariance matrices .",
    "this generalisation has not reproduced lders rules .",
    "our derivation of lders rule is not only the first such result obtained for umegaki s and araki s distances , but also first result of this type obtained for any nonsymmetric quantum information distance .",
    "all results for quantum jeffrey s rule are new .",
    "see also a closely related paper @xcite , where the analogous results for weak and strong lders rules are derived using another technique ( based on differentiation , as opposed to generalised pythagorean theorem ) .",
    ", where @xmath3 are rank @xmath4 projectors , minimises the umegaki distance @xmath5 .",

    "the modern mathematical formulation of the bayes  laplace foundations for probability theory @xcite is based on finitely additive boolean algebras @xmath6 and conditional probabilities , defined as maps @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "its kinematics is given by the rules @xmath8 from which the @xcite follows , @xmath9 the ` marginal probability ' @xmath10 , called also an ` evidence ' , is a normalising constant calculated from @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a countable set , while the set @xmath13 is exhaustive ( @xmath14 ) and its elements are mutually exclusive ( @xmath15 for @xmath16 ) . in the simple cases this set may consist of two elements : @xmath17 .",
    "the dynamics of this approach is given by the @xmath18 the map determines a rule of construction of the new conditional probability assignment associated to @xmath19 under the constraint that certain additional statements ( ` facts ' , ` data ' , ` events ' ) @xmath20 are considered as ( ` appear as ' , ` are known as ' , ` are regarded as ' ) true or false .",
    "so , @xmath21 in is interpreted as a ( ` posterior ' ) conditional probability assigned to @xmath19 whenever the truth value of @xmath20 is given ( ` known ' ) . if attribution of a definite truth value to @xmath22 is interpreted as an ` acquisition of data / facts ' , then the bayes ",
    "laplace rule can be understood as a procedure of statistical inference that transforms ` prior ' information states @xmath23 about _ all _ ` hypotheses ' @xmath24 into ` posterior ' information states @xmath21 , under constraints provided by the acquired data @xmath20 _ and _ the assumed relationship between @xmath20 and @xmath19 which is encoded in the information states @xmath25 .",
    "the probability @xmath25 is sometimes called the ` sampling probability ' ( because before the constraint @xmath20 is applied , @xmath25 can represent a probability associated with possible values of constraints for a fixed hypothesis @xmath19 ) or the ` likelihood ' ( because after the constraint @xmath20 is applied , @xmath25 is considered as a probability of @xmath20 as a function over possible hypotheses @xmath19 ) .",
    "jeffrey @xcite proposed an alternative dynamical rule , now called , @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is a set of exhaustive and mutually exclusive elements of @xmath6 , and the constraints @xmath29 @xmath30 hold .",
    "the defining equality in is equivalent to the condition @xmath31 if @xmath32 with @xmath33 and if @xmath34 , then jeffrey s rule reduces to the bayes  laplace rule .    the first derivation of the bayes  laplace and jeffrey s rules from constrained minimisation of the information distance functional ( more precisely , the wgkl distance ) was provided by williams @xcite .",
    "however , as he admitted , his derivation has a restricted validity , because it does not deal with conditional probabilities .",
    "this can be solved following van fraassen s suggestion : @xcite . following the results of caticha and giffin @xcite ,",
    "consider a constrained minimisation of the wgkl distance , @xmath35 for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , with parametrisation @xmath38 allowing to consider a measure space @xmath39 as well as a product measure space @xmath40 , and with constraints given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are lagrange multipliers , and @xmath44 is dirac s delta at @xmath45 .",
    "the posterior probability selected as a unique solution of this variational problem is given by @xmath46 where @xmath43 is determined via @xmath47 hence , @xmath48 which leads to the bayes ",
    "laplace rule on @xmath49 , can be interpreted as a density of a conditional measure under some conditions .",
    "this is not problematic as long as one interprets the above derivation as a proof of backwards compatibility of entropic projections with the bayes",

    "if the second constraint in is replaced by a more general form , @xmath54 corresponding to a condition @xmath55 with a given probability density @xmath56 , then the entropic projection reproduces jeffrey s rule on @xmath49 , @xmath57    the bayes ",
    "laplace rule changes information states by means of constraints imposed on the level of propositions , while the entropic projections utilise constraints imposed on probabilities .",
    "hence , in order to recover the former rule from the maximum entropy rule one needs a very strong constraint , which forces a unique reference of probability distribution to an underlying space @xmath58 of propositions : @xmath59 .",
    "so , while ( for example ) the mean value constraints can be partially dismissed by the new knowledge that is incorporated by the sequential maximum relative entropy updating ( see e.g. @xcite ) , dirac s delta constraints always remain preserved by subsequent updatings .",
    "space , while usually the mean value constraints are applied by integration over @xmath58 space , but nevertheless this remark holds in general . ] from this perspective , jeffrey s rule can be understood as arising due to weakening of constraints , which are allowed to carry some additional uncertainty .",
    "more generally , diaconis and zabell @xcite have shown that , for a suitable choice of constraints , jeffrey s rule can be derived from a constrained minimisation of any csiszr ",

    "in particular , @xcite derived jeffrey s rule from constrained minimisation of @xmath62 . in theorem [ weighted.vnlu.theorem ] of section [ vn.lu.section ] we will derive a quantum analogue of the latter result .",
    "in this section we present the mathematical terminology that is used throughout the paper .",
    "we also briefly introduce some more advanced notions and results from the theory of operator algebras that are required to set up the mathematical background and notation for the @xmath0-algebraic part of the results presented in sections [ vn.lu.section ] and [ transition.correlation.section ] .",

    "however , as opposed to the semi - spectral approach , our approach completely detaches from the reliance on the use of spectral theory in foundations of quantum theory , allowing for more flexible operational specification of the ` experimental evidence ' , and for deriving `` quantum measurement '' rules from a single underlying principle ( entropic projection ) , which is alternative to quantum channels .",
    "in particular , the use of quantum distance as an underlying mathematical structure allows for geometric analysis and justification of the choice of a specific convention of quantum inference / dynamics .",
    "this is in contrast with the general lack of clear geometric justification for a choice of a specific quantum channel in the semi - spectral approach .",
    "an extended development of the approach based on quantum entropic projections as an alternative to povm - instruments , and as a replacement for lders rules , will be carried out in @xcite .",
    "for an alternative derivation of lders rules from quantum entropic projections based on @xmath322 , see @xcite .    what does it all mean for quantum bayesianism ?",
    "quite often ` bayesianism ' is understood as a subjective interpretation of probability equipped with the requirement of using the bayes ",
    "laplace rule for the purpose of changing probabilities due to learning new information .",
    "however , the appearance of other updating rules , such as jeffrey s rule , field s rule @xcite , and constrained maximisation of the wgkl distance @xcite , has undermined the universality of a second component .",
    "the usual perspective on the meaning of ` quantum bayesianism ' starts from the semi - spectral approach to mathematical foundations of quantum theory , and aims at recasting ( some suitable class of ) povm - instruments as ( a modified form of ) the bayes ",
    "laplace rule , while keeping the subjective interpretation of probabilities .",
    "such perspective assumes that probability theory and spectral theory should be fundamental constitutents of quantum theory .",
    "moreover , it also does not provide justification for using povm - instruments : the mathematical foundations are just taken for granted .",
    "the results contained in this paper are intended to serve as a guideline ( via quantum jeffrey s rule ) and as a backwards compatibility proof ( via recovery of lders rules ) for an alternative approach to the mathematical and conceptual meaning of ` quantum bayesianism ' . according to our point of view",
    ", quantum states should be used as carriers of intersubjective knowledge on their own mathematical right ( as elements of a noncommutative @xmath629 space ) , without reference to probabilities ( elements of a commutative @xmath629 space ) , while the processes of inductive inference ( information dynamics ) can be fruitfully modelled using quantum entropic projections as a nonlinear alternative to the bayes  laplace rule and linear povm - instruments .",
