    "in the quest for molecular magnets which might be useful for practical applications such as ultradense magnetic storage @xcite , quantum computing @xcite , or other interesting devices @xcite , one finds at times molecules which combine structural beauty , promising chemistry for further development , non - trivial physics and practically interesting properties ( intramolecular exchange interactions , magnetic anisotropy ) . such new molecular materials often arise from metal - organic synthesis , which is the main driving force in studies of molecular magnets ( see , e.g. , the monograph by kahn @xcite , or refs .",

    "[ fig : fe_dos ] ) : whereas in the fefe@xmath3star the magnetization density changes its sign exactly at the bridging o , in the crfe@xmath3star this oxygen atom is fully magnetized along with its fe neighbor , and oppositely to cr .",
    "one can speculate that the matrix elements of the core - valence transitions , which include differently composed molecular orbitals in the valence band of fefe@xmath3 and crfe@xmath3stars , may affect relative weights of @xmath31 and @xmath63 emission .",

    "we can , with relative certainty , eliminate the following other hypothetical explanations of a different behavior in the @xmath66 intensity ratio of the crfe@xmath3star .",
    "a possibility of a low - spin state is ruled out by the calculation result that in all trial spin - polarized calculations , the local magnetic moments remained essentially fixed to @xmath393  @xmath69 at the cr site and @xmath394  @xmath70 at fe sites .",
    "there is no way to `` prepare '' the system with a low - spin state of either cr , or fe @xcite .",
    "all inversions of individual local moments from the ground state , including the situation with the lowest total magnetic moment of 2 @xmath69 in the cr@xmath71fe@xmath72fe@xmath72fe@xmath71 star , preserve the `` strong magnetism '' at the fe site and the partial emptiness of the majority - spin states at the cr site , with strong similarities of their corresponding dos to those shown in figs . [",
    "fig : fe_dos ] and [ fig : cr_dos ] .",
    "also the assumed cr substitution in the peripheral position ( highly energetically unfavorable , as was mentioned above ) affected the magnetic moments and local dos only slightly .",
    "an additional inclusion of on - site intraatomic coulomb correlation beyond the conventional dft treatment may affect the energy placements of @xmath7 levels in the cr and fe dos , but it can only enhance the `` strong magnetism '' at the fe site rather than ease it , in the presence of cr dopant .",
    "therefore the understanding of @xmath66 behavior in the crfe@xmath3-star is incomplete on the basis of dft calculations , whereas an explanation of the behavior in fefe@xmath3star seems rather obvious , and consistent with the observed trend @xcite for feo , as compared to fes@xmath5 .",
    "we can only emphasize the observed difference in rixs spectra of fefe@xmath3 and crfe@xmath3stars as an experimental finding , which might stimulate additional research on these systems .",
    "we have reported photoemission and photoabsorption spectra of \\{_m_[fe(l@xmath1)@xmath2@xmath3}@xmath4 4chcl@xmath3 ( @xmath0 = fe , cr ) in comparison with first - principles electronic structure calculations .",
    "first we determined the charge state of fe in these `` ferric stars '' , in view of an existing controversy between the expected nominal chemical valence ( fe iii ) , from one side , and the calculated value of the fe local magnetic moment ( 4 @xmath70 ) , that would imply a bivalent iron , from the other side . on the basis of a comparison of the fe @xmath8 and @xmath32 photoelectron spectra with those of reference compounds ,",
    "the charge state of fe in the fefe@xmath3star was argued to be @xmath73 .",
    "the valence - band x - ray photoelectron spectrum and the x - ray fe@xmath28 , o and n@xmath29 emission spectra show little structure but are otherwise in agreement with dft calculations . in the fefe@xmath3 and crfe@xmath3stars ,",
    "the @xmath66 intensity ratio in resonant x - ray emission , varies according to the excitation energy on going through the fe @xmath59 threshold .",
    "the trend observed in the fefe@xmath3star is similar to that earlier reported by yablonskikh _",
    "_ and prince _ et al .",
    "_ , and believed to be a signature of `` high - spin '' structures , or more precisely of strong magnetic systems , like e.g. feo or heusler alloys .",
    "the explanation of this behavior is consistent with the assumption that the coster ",
    "kronig process probability is suppressed in strong magnets .",
    "the dft calculation does indeed support an assumption of such strong magnetic behavior in the fefe@xmath3-star .",
    "however , the crfe@xmath3-star does not show such a trend in the @xmath66 intensity , even though the local electronic structure at the fe site remains largely the same as in the fefe@xmath3-star , and the loss of strong magnetic character appears confined to the cr center .",
