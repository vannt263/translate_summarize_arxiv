    "this fact provides an additional motivation to investigate other possible metrics and distances in the space of mixed quantum states .",
    "nowadays it is widely accepted that the bures metric @xcite , is distinguished by its rather special properties : it is a riemannian , monotone metric , which is fisher  adjusted @xcite : in the subspace of diagonal matrices it induces the statistical distance @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is also fubini  study  adjusted , since it agrees with this metric at the space of pure states @xcite .",
    "the bures distance between any two mixed states is a function of their fidelity @xcite and various properties of this distance are a subject of considerable interest ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a given distance between density matrices induces a certain measure in this space . the probability measure in the space of mixed quantum states induced by the bures metric",
    "was defined by hall @xcite .",
    "he demonstrated that the eigenvectors of a random state of size @xmath2 generated according to this measure are distributed according to the haar measure on @xmath9 , derived an explicit expression for the joint probability density for eigenvalues of a random state generated according to this measure and found for @xmath4 the normalization constant @xmath10 for the joint probability density of the eigenvalues .",
    "further bures  hall normalization constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 were calculated by slater @xcite , but the problem of finding the constants @xmath10 for arbitrary @xmath2 remained unsolved .",
    "the aim of this work is to compute the volume of the set @xmath1 of all density matrices of size @xmath2 and the hyperarea of its boundary according to the bures measure .",
    "this work is complementary to our parallel paper @xcite , in which the volume was computed according to the hilbert - schmidt measure , but the notation and the structure of both papers are not exactly the same . in this work",
    "we treat in parallel two different cases : of complex density matrices , and its particular subset , of real density matrices .",
    "both cases are labeled by the repulsion exponent @xmath13 for the complex case and @xmath14 for the real case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the bures distance is defined and its remarkable properties are reviewed . in section",
    "iii we derive the bures measure and express the volume and the surface of the space of mixed states as a function of the hall normalization constants .",
    "key results of the paper are presented in section iv , in which we compute the normalization constants @xmath10 for arbitrary @xmath2 , see ( [ hallconst ] ) , and calculate explicitly the bures volume of @xmath1 , see eq .",

    "this set has the structure of a complex projective space , @xmath17 , and there exists a distinguished , unitarily invariant measure , which corresponds to the geodesic distance on this manifold .",

    "this quantity was generalized for an arbitrary pair of mixed quantum states by uhlmann @xcite",

    "hence a function of fidelity , called _ bures length _ @xcite or _ angle _",
    "@xcite , @xmath22 coincides for any pair of pure states with their fubini  study distance ( [ fs ] )",
    ".    fidelity may also be defined @xcite as the maximal overlap between the purifications of two mixed states , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and both mixed states are obtained by partial tracing over the auxiliary subsystem @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "fidelity allows one to characterize the `` closeness '' of a pair of mixed states : it is equal to unity only if both states do coincide .",
    "another function of fidelity , @xmath27 satisfies all axioms of a distance and is called _ bures distance _ @xcite .",
    "hence bures metric is fubini  study adjusted , since for pure states it induces the same geometry .",
    "several relevant papers on this subject are due to uhlmann @xcite , who showed that the topological metric of bures is riemannian .",
    "hbner provided a detailed analysis of the @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath28 case @xcite , while dittmann analyzed differential geometric properties of the bures metric @xcite .",
    "relations of the bures metric to information theory can be seen in papers by fuchs and caves @xcite , vedral and plenio @xcite while the closely related fidelity is often used in the comprehensive book by nielsen and chang @xcite .",
    "it was shown by braunstein and caves @xcite that for neighbouring density matrices the bures distance is proportional to the statistical distance introduced by wootters @xcite in the context of measurements which optimally resolve neighbouring quantum states .    for diagonal matrices , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ,",
    "the expression for the bures distance simplifies and becomes a function of the _ bhattacharyya coefficient _",
    "@xcite , @xmath31 , @xmath32 this is the euclidean distance between two points on a unit circle , the corresponding vectors form the angle @xmath33 such that @xmath34 .",
    "the geodesic distance along the circle @xmath35 , is called in this case the _ statistical distance _ , since it provides a measure of distinguishability between both probability distributions by statistical sampling .",
    "another function is called the _ hellinger distance _",
    "@xcite @xmath36    it is clear that for any two diagonal density matrices their fidelity reduces to the squared bhattacharyya coefficient , @xmath37 , while the bures distance between both states coincides with the hellinger distance between both vectors of eigenvalues , @xmath38 .",
    "let us write the bures distance for infinitesimally closed diagonal states defined by the vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 since @xmath42 and @xmath43 , so computing the bures line element d@xmath44 we need to expand the square root up to the second order , and obtain @xmath45  precisely the metric on a sphere , or also , the statistical metric on the simplex , also called _ fisher - rao _ metric @xcite .",
    "hence the bures metric is _ fisher  adjusted _  restricted to the simplex of diagonal matrices it agrees with this metric . for @xmath4 the simplex of diagonal matrices is one - dimensional , and from the point of view of bures metric it forms a semicircle .",

    "since the radius @xmath73 of the uhlmann hemisphere is equal to @xmath3 we obtain immediately the bures volume @xmath74 and the bures area @xmath75 for @xmath4 @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the volume of the unit sphere @xmath78 .",
    "this result was obtained by caves @xcite , who also expressed the bures volume of the set of mixed states in form of an integral . in the further sections of our work we are going to compute such integrals to derive an explicit result for the bures volume for an arbitrary matrix size @xmath2 .",
    "the last property of the bures metric , we are going to review , concerns monotonicity . in the classical case of commuting diagonal density matrices ,",
    "one studies the space of probability vectors @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "this space is isomorphic with an @xmath82 dimensional simplex @xmath83 .",
    "a discrete dynamics in this space , @xmath84 , is given by an arbitrary stochastic matrix @xmath85 of size @xmath2 .",
    "this matrix contains non  negative entries , @xmath86 , and the stochasticity condition , @xmath87 for @xmath88 assures that the output vector @xmath89 is normalized . a distance in the space @xmath83 of @xmath2dimensional probability vectors is called _ monotone _ , if it does not increase under the action of any stochastic matrix @xmath85 , @xmath90 if a geodesic distance in the probability simplex is monotone , the corresponding riemannian metric is called monotone .",
    "chentsov showed @xcite that every monotone riemannian distance in this space is a function of the fisher statistical distance @xcite , or the bhattacharyya coefficient @xmath91 defined in ( [ bures2 ] ) .",
    "the quantum case is more complicated .",
    "any discrete dynamics may be described by a quantum operation , @xmath92 , which is trace preserving , tr@xmath93 , and completely positive .",
    "positivity means that @xmath94 , i.e. @xmath95 sends positive operators into positive operators . from a physical point of view",
    "it is necessary to assure that an operation is well defined on the system coupled to an ancilla - an auxiliary system which describes the environment .",
    "hence one requires that @xmath95 is _ completely positive _ , which means that any extension of the map by an identity operator , @xmath96 , is positive @xcite .",
    "completely positive trace preserving maps play the role of stochastic matrices @xmath85 in the quantum case , and are thus called _ stochastic maps_. in full analogy to ( [ monot1 ] ) any distance @xmath97 in the space of mixed quantum states @xmath98 is called _ monotone _ if it does not grow under the action of a stochastic map , @xmath99 if a monotone distance is geodesic the corresponding metric on @xmath1 is called monotone .    -0.2 cm : minimal function for maximal metric ( dotted line ) , kubo  mori metric ( dashed line ) , and maximal function for the minimal , bures metric ( upper line ) .",
    "these metrics are fisher  adjusted , @xmath100 , while bures metric is also fubini  study adjusted , @xmath101.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] -0.2 cm    in contrast to the classical case , there exist infinitely many monotone riemannian metrics on the space of mixed quantum states . however , as shown by morozova and chentsov @xcite and petz and sudr @xcite , they may be characterized by a symmetric function @xmath102 . in general , the length of a vector ( matrix ) @xmath103 may be position dependent ; at a diagonal point @xmath104 the squared length of @xmath91 is given by @xcite @xmath105 for a diagonal matrix @xmath91 the second term vanishes and the first term gives back the unique statistical metric on the simplex .",
    "the off  diagonal elements , which enter the second term in ( [ monot3 ] ) , allow for more freedom in the choice of a monotone riemannian metric .",
    "the morozova - chentsov function satisfies @xmath106 .",
    "the symmetry of this two  argument function @xmath107 enables to express it by a function of a single parameter , @xmath108 , such that @xmath109 .",

    "@xmath115 denotes that their difference is semi positive , @xmath116 .",
    "taking for @xmath111 and @xmath112 real numbers we see that operator monotonicity implies that @xmath110 maps @xmath117 and is concave .",
    "the result of morozova and chentsov @xcite , completed and extended by petz and sudr @xcite , states that every monotone metric may be written in the form ( [ monot3 ] ) up a proportionality constant .",
    "conversely , this equation determines a monotone riemannian metric , if the function @xmath118 is : a ) operator monotone , and b ) self  transposed , @xmath109 .",
    "such functions @xmath110 are called morozova  chentsov functions .",
    "comparison of different metrics is meaningful under a certain normalization .",
    "usually one requires : c ) @xmath100 , since for diagonal matrices such a metric agrees with the statistical ( fisher ) metric , and is called _ fisher  adjusted_. there exists infinitely many functions @xmath110 satisfying all three conditions a)c ) , and leading to fisher  adjusted metrics @xcite .",
    "let us mention three examples here : @xmath119 containing both extremal cases and the intermediate kubo - mori ( bogolioubov ) metric used in quantum statistical mechanics @xcite and distinguished by the fact that both affine connections with respect to this metric are mutually dual @xcite .",
    "these functions , plotted in fig .",
    "2 , correspond to @xmath120 so the inverse , @xmath121 , is equal to the harmonic , logarithmic and arithmetic mean , respectively .",
    "it is known that among all normalised , self - transposed , operator monotone functions @xmath110 there is a minimal and a maximal one @xcite .",
    "they are distinguished above by the appropriate labels .",
    "the maximal concave function @xmath122 , the straight line @xmath123 , induces the bures metric and the bures distance @xcite .",
    "if @xmath101 the metric induces the natural riemannian metric on the subspace @xmath17 of pure states and is called _ fubini - study adjusted _",
    "the bures metric is the only monotone metric which is simultaneously fisher  adjusted and fubini  study  adjusted .",
    "this property , valid for any matrix size @xmath2 , is easiest to discuss for @xmath4 .",
    "all metrics defined by ( [ monot3 ] ) are rotationally invariant , i.e. the uniform angular distribution ( of eigenvectors of the density matrix ) is independent of the radial distribution ( of its eigenvalues ) . in the one",
    " qubit case the metric depends only on the radius @xmath124 in the unit bloch ball , and may be divided into the radial and the normal ( tangential ) components @xcite , @xmath125 the radial component is independent of the function @xmath110 .",
    "it is easy to see that the value of @xmath126 at @xmath127 determines the metric at the subspace of pure states , @xmath128 . if @xmath129 , then the metric diverges at the manifold of pure states , which is the case for @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "the relation between the morozova - chentsov function and the metric @xmath132 shows that the larger the ( normalized ) function @xmath110 , the smaller the metric and the corresponding distance .",
    "the bures metric given by the _ maximal _",
    "function @xmath122 , is therefore the _ minimal _ fisher  adjusted , monotone riemannian metric .",
    "these properties single out the bures metric and provide an additional motivation to study the geometry it induces in the set of mixed quantum states .",
    "we are going to compute the bures distance ( [ bures ] ) between two infinitesimally close density matrices of size @xmath2 .",
    "let us set @xmath133 : @xmath134 where the matrix @xmath135 is of order @xmath136 in @xmath137 , while @xmath138 is of order @xmath72 . squaring this equation",

    "let us rewrite the metric ( [ metricb ] ) distinguishing the diagonal elements @xmath150 for diagonal matrices the second term vanishes and the above expression reduces to ( [ ds2bur ] ) . since @xmath142 so @xmath151 and not all @xmath152 are independent .",
    "eliminating @xmath153 we obtain @xmath154 the metric ( [ partmetricb1 ] ) in the @xmath155dimensional subspace is of the form @xmath156 with determinant @xmath157 using @xmath142 .",
    "thus the volume element gains a factor @xmath158 : @xmath159 the total volume of the set @xmath1 is given by : @xmath160 with @xmath161 a step function that restricts integration to nonnegative @xmath46 .",
    "we introduced the volume element @xmath162 which differs from the usual definition by a factor @xmath163 .",
