    "we discuss specific aspects of the core of a vortex line in layered high t@xmath1 superconductors .",
    "the physics of these vortices is governed by two distinct length scales , the london penetration depth in the planes , @xmath2 , and the coherence length in the planes , @xmath3 .",
    "the penetration depth is the electromagnetic length scale of a vortex .",
    "the physics on this length scale is well described by a combination of macroscopic electromagnetism , london s theory for supercurrents along the layers , and interlayer josephson coupling .",
    "this description breaks down in the core of the vortex , _",
    "i.e. _ at distances of order @xmath4 from the center of the vortex .",
    "thus , physical properties of the core carry information on the microscopic physics of high t@xmath1 superconductivity .",
    "the small coherence length of high t@xmath1 superconductors makes the vortex core a good potential sensor for microscopic mechanisms of superconductivity .",
    "our discussion of the vortex core in high t@xmath1 superconductors is based on the fermi - liquid model of superconductivity .",
    "the physical properties of the vortex core predicted by this model are spectacular , unique , and could serve as fingerprints of the traditional pairing theory of superconductivity",
    ".    the vortex core of traditional high-@xmath5 superconductors is well described by the bardeen - stephen model@xcite which represents the core by a region of normal electrons .",
    "the bardeen - stephen model is justified as long as the mean free path , @xmath6 , is much shorter than the core size , so that the motion of an electron gets randomized before it leaves the core .",
    "this condition is not fulfilled in high t@xmath1 superconductors which are generally clean superconductors with @xmath7 .",
    "the core of a vortex in a clean superconductor was first studied in the classic papers of caroli , matricon , and de gennes.@xcite these authors calculated the spectrum of quasiparticle states in the core , and showed that electrons and holes form bound states at energies below the bulk energy gap .",
    "further early studies of the excitation spectrum in the core can be found in refs . .",
    "more recent theoretical work was stimulated by the direct observation of core states in @xmath8 by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy ( sts).@xcite the recent report of sts in ybco @xcite provides new information on the excitation spectrum of vortices in the high @xmath9 cuprates .",
    "consequently , theoretical efforts focused on the tunnelling density of states of bound states in isolated vortices and vortex lattices.@xcite these calculations show that the bound states in the core have a different nature compared with the usual quantum mechanical bound states in a potential well .",
    "the core states are coherent superpositions of particle states and hole states and are formed by repeated andreev scattering from the pair potential ( order parameter ) in the core .",
    "andreev scattering is a process of `` retroreflection '' of excitations : spatial variations of the amplitude or the phase of the order parameter induce branch conversion of electron - like excitations into hole - like excitations , and vice versa .",
    "bound states occur at energies at which the phases of multiply reflected electron - like and hole - like states interfere constructively .",
    "the charge current carried by an incoming electron and an outgoing andreev reflected hole is identical because the reversal of the velocity in an andreev reflection process is compensated by the reversal of the charge due to electron - hole conversion .",
    "consequently , andreev bound states can transport a charge current , unlike bound states in a potential well .",
    "charge conservation requires that the current carried by the bound states inside the core is transported outside the core by bulk supercurrents .",
    "this leads to an interplay between supercurrents flowing past the core and the bound states in the core .",
    "hence , the physics of the ` normal core ' in clean superconductors is basically the physics of the bound states in contact and intimate exchange with the superconducting environment outside the core .",
    "consider a stack of `` pancake '' vortices forming an isolated vortex line whose axis is oriented perpendicular to the layers .",
    "we investigate the current distribution in the core of a pancake vortex , and show how this distribution changes if the vortex is exposed to a bulk supercurrent , or the circulation is changed from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "we calculate the _ spectral current density _ , which carries the information on the contribution of the states in a given energy interval to the total current density .",
    "a supercurrent in homogeneous superconductors is distributed over all continuum states .",
    "these states exhibit doppler shifts of their energies , @xmath12 , in the presence of a phase gradient in the order parameter ( or superfluid momentum , @xmath13 ) .",
    "the total current is obtained by adding the contributions of states with positive shifts from quasiparticles co - moving with the flow and the contributions with negative shifts from quasiparticles that are counter - moving relative to the flow field .",
    "we find that the currents in the core have a very different spectral distribution from bulk supercurrents .",
    "the continuum states ( scattering states ) show smeared out doppler shifts , and contribute very little to the total current .",
    "the dominant contributions to the circulating currents around the vortex center , as well as the currents through the core , come from andreev bound states .",
    "hence , the physics of vortex cores in clean superconductors ( @xmath14 ) is very different from the physics of the vortex core in a dirty superconductor ( @xmath15 ) , which is well described by a continuum of normal electronic states . the calculations presented in this paper concentrate on stationary properties of the vortex core of clean layered superconductors .",
    "we expect more spectacular effects in the dynamic properties .",
    "the bound states react sensitively to the environment outside of the core .",
    "this leads to a coupling of the collective degrees of freedom in the london range of the vortex and the bound states in the core , which will produce a rich spectrum of largely unexplored dynamical phenomena .",
    "below we present analytical and numerical calculations for the states in the vortex core .",
    "we use two versions of a quasiclassical formulation of the bcs theory of superconductivity : a ) _ andreev s theory_@xcite which represents the quasiclassical limit of bogolyubov s equations,@xcite and b ) the _ quasiclassical theory _ of eilenberger @xcite , larkin , and ovchinnikov@xcite which represents the quasiclassical limit of gorkov s green s function theory .",
    "andreev s theory and the quasiclassical theory are essentially equivalent for clean superconductors , and in this limit the choice of approach is largely a matter of taste .",
    "however , the quasiclassical theory has a wider range of application .",
    "it is the generalization of landau s fermi liquid theory to the superconducting state , and is capable of describing a broader range of superconducting materials and phenomena , such as dirty superconductors or superconductors with short inelastic lifetimes ( strong - coupling superconductors).@xcite section ii contains analytical results for the bound states and the spectral current density for a pancake vortex with a superimposed bulk supercurrent .",
    "these results are obtained from andreev s hamiltonian@xcite by the methods described in ref . . in section iii",
    "we discuss the numerical results , which are obtained using the quasiclassical theory of fermi - liquid superconductivity .",
    "we solve the quasiclassical transport equations to obtain self - consistently the pair amplitude ( order parameter ) for pancake vortices .",
    "given the pair amplitude we calculate the excitation spectrum in the core of the vortex , and deduce from it the spectral current density .",
    "the numerical calculations are done for layered superconductors with s - wave pairing .",
    "the analytical and numerical results confirm and complement each other , and they establish the important role of the bound states for the currents in the core region of a vortex .",
    "in this section , we investigate the spectrum of current carrying states of a two - dimensional pancake vortex in equilibrium at temperature @xmath16 , in the presence of an externally imposed supercurrent .",
    "we ignore the spin degree of freedom of a quasiparticle excitation;@xcite in this case it is sufficient to work in the two - dimensional space of particle - hole degrees of freedom .",
    "operators in this space are @xmath17 matrices , and we use the notation @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , for the three pauli matrices in particle - hole space ( nambu space ) , and @xmath21 for the unit matrix .",
    "the hamiltonian for the quasiparticle excitations , @xcite the bogolyubov hamiltonian , then reads : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the momentum and position operators appropriate to a particle moving in two dimensions , @xmath25 is the fermi momentum and @xmath26 is the electromagnetic vector potential .",

    "the main assumption we make in this section is that the order - parameter in the presence of a superflow @xmath37 has the form @xmath38 we assume throughout this section that @xmath39 is small compared to the bulk critical current , @xmath40 .    the principal physical quantities with which we shall concern ourselves are the _ spectral current density _ , and the total equilibrium current density which is related to @xmath41 by @xmath42 we shall also make reference to the local density of states , @xmath43 .",

    "most calculations of the properties of superconductors with inhomogeneous order parameters are simpler in the quasiclassical limit , where one takes advantage of the separation in the scales of the wavelength of quasiparticles near the fermi energy and the characteristic scale for spatial variations of the pair potential , i.e. @xmath52 . the quasiclassical limit of the bogolyubov hamiltonian ( [ bogoliubov ] ) is the andreev hamiltonian in which the kinetic energy in ( [ bogoliubov ] ) is replaced by an operator that is _ linear _ in the gradient.@xcite let us define the normal - state density of states at the fermi level , @xmath53 , and introduce the directions , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which are , respectively , parallel and perpendicular to trajectories of a quasiparticle wavepacket in the quasiclassical description , _",

    "the lowest energy bound state in the core has a zero - point energy of @xmath222 which is outside the resolution of the quasiclassical or the andreev theory .",
    "the discrete spectrum of the bogolyubov theory corresponds to the continuous andreev spectrum in the limit where the level spacing is small compared to all other relevant energy scales , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath223 , etc .",
    "this is generally an excellent approximation in conventional type ii superconductors .",
    "for the high @xmath9 cuprates the discrete level structure is expected to play a more important role , particularly in the transverse response of vortices in the ultra - clean limit , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath224 , where @xmath225 is the mean scattering time.@xcite    =      it is interesting to compare the single - quantum vortex with the axially symmetric , @xmath11 vortex , @xmath226 .",
    "the double quantum vortex has higher energy than a pair of isolated single - quantum vortices ; however , once created the double - quantum vortex is metastable against dissociation into singly - quantized vortices .",
    "the amplitude of the order parameter for the double - quantum vortex decreases as @xmath227 for @xmath228 as shown in fig .",
    "=    in contrast to the @xmath10 vortex there is no sign change of the order parameter for trajectories passing through the center of the vortex core .",
    "this difference has a profound effect on the spectrum of andreev bound states in the core .",
    "3b shows the excitation spectrum of the doubly - quantized vortex at the center of a trajectory passing through the center of the vortex core .",
    "a symmetric spectrum of two bound states at @xmath229 are separated from the continuum .",
    "figure 3 also shows the current density of the doubly - quantized vortex .",
    "the remarkable feature is the _ reversal _ of the current direction in the core , i.e. for @xmath230 ( see fig . 3c and 3d ) .",
    "this current anomaly is associated with the appearance of a counter - moving andreev bound state below the fermi level ( @xmath231 ) .",
    "the evolution of the spectral current density is shown in fig .",
    "the trajectories are parallel to @xmath232 and the spectral current density is shown as a function of the impact parameter . at distances greater than @xmath233 two bound states lie below zero energy , and both states are co - moving with the circulating phase gradient , @xmath105 . as the vortex core is approached the co - moving bound state nearest the fermi level moves to higher energy , and a counter - moving bound state above the fermi level ( not shown ) moves to lower energy .",
    "these two states cross the fermi energy ( @xmath231 ) at approximately @xmath234 , leading to a reversal of the integrated current density inside the core . the cumulative current density for each trajectory",
    "is shown as the thick solid line in each panel of fig .",
    "4 .    =      finally , consider the current and excitation spectrum of a @xmath10 vortex in the presence of a uniform supercurrent @xmath235 . in the absence of pinning",
    "the vortex will move in the direction ( @xmath236 ) in order to reduce the kinetic energy .",
    "thus , in order to investigate the excitation spectrum in the presence of a transport current we must pin the vortex to the lattice .",
    "our model for the pinning center is a normal metal inclusion where the pairing interaction ( or the local @xmath9 ) vanishes .",
    "5a shows the order parameter of a pinned vortex for an @xmath189-wave superconductor and a pinning center with a radius of @xmath237 . in the presence of a transport",
    "current the amplitude of the order parameter deforms ; it is suppressed on the high current side of the vortex as shown in fig .",
    "5a . for relatively small transport currents , e.g. @xmath238 , the center for the phase winding lies within the normal inclusion .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "5b , the vortex current no longer vanishes at the center of the vortex core ; there is substantial current _ through _ the vortex core region , including the normal inclusion .",
    "the current density inside the normal inclusion is carried by the andreev bound states and is a consequence of the proximity effect .",
    "the bound state spectrum at the center of the vortex is shown for a trajectory parallel to the transport current and passing through the vortex center .",
    "the negative energy bound state carries the transport current inside the normal inclusion .",
    "5d shows the spectral current density measured at the center of the normal inclusion for the trajectories with @xmath239 .",
    "note that the bound state dominates the current and that this current is opposite to the applied transport current .",
    "this result was also obtained in section [ analyt ] , without taking into account the distortion of the vortex core order parameter .",
    "this led to a violation of charge conservation in the core .",
    "our numerical calculation shows that the main features of the analytic model for the bound state spectrum and the self - consistent determination of the order parameter for the pinned vortex in the presence of a transport current guarantees that charge is conserved .",
    "we have discussed the current carried by the excitations of s - wave vortices in clean layered superconductors .",
    "the _ spectral current density _ was introduced in order to identify the excitations that determine the transport and circulating currents of a vortex .",
    "the bound states of the vortex carry most of the current in the vicinity of the core , including transport currents that flow through the core of a pinned vortex .",
    "far from the vortex core currents are carried primarily by the bound - pair continuum that forms the condensate . for currents flowing through a pinned vortex , current conservation",
    "is maintained by `` spectral transfer '' of the current carried by the andreev bound states to the continuum states outside the core .",
    "a novel example of the evolution of the spectral current density is provided by the double quantum vortex which shows the connection between the spectrum of bound states and the symmetry or topology of the order parameter . at low temperatures ( @xmath240 )",
    "the double quantum vortex exhibits a ` current reversal ' relative to the asymptotic direction of the circulation .",
    "the counter - circulating current in the core is due to a counter - moving bound state that appears below the fermi level and dominates the current for distances of order @xmath241 . at high temperatures , @xmath242 ,",
    "this counter - moving bound state is thermally depopulated with the result that the current reversal in the core disappears in the ginzburg - landau limit . in summary , we find that the andreev bound states dominate the current of vortices on the scale of a few coherence lengths . the nonequilibrium properties of vortices on this scale are expected to be dominated by the spectral evolution and dynamics of these bound states .",
    "this work was initiated when the authors were participants at a workshop at the institute for scientific interchange , villa gualino , torino .",
    "the research of dw was supported in part by the engineering and physical sciences research council , while that of dr and jas was supported in part by nsf grant dmr 91 - 20000 through the science and technology center for superconductivity , the max planck gesellschaft and the alexander von humboldt stiftung .",
    "we also thank dr .",
    "m. j. graf for his comments on the manuscript .",
    "in this appendix we derive a form for a matrix element used in section [ div ] .",
    "the matrix element in question is @xmath243|\\zeta \\rangle _ { 1,1}$ ] where we write @xmath244 we have @xmath245 =   i\\left ( \\hat\\tau_{3 } ( \\hat{h}_a-\\hat{\\delta } ) \\delta ( \\epsilon -\\hat{h}_a)-\\delta ( \\epsilon -\\hat{h}_a)(\\hat{h}_a-\\hat{\\delta } ) \\hat\\tau_{3}\\right)\\ ] ] @xmath246-i\\{\\hat\\tau_{3}% \\hat{\\delta } , \\delta ( \\epsilon -\\hat{h}_a)\\}\\,.\\ ] ] then @xmath247|\\zeta \\rangle _ { 1,1 }   =   i \\mbox{tr}\\left [ \\frac 12(1+\\hat\\tau_{3})\\langle   \\zeta |([\\hat\\tau_{3}\\epsilon , \\delta ( \\epsilon -\\hat{h}_a)]- \\{\\hat\\tau_{3 } \\hat{\\delta } , \\delta ( \\epsilon -\\hat{h}_a)\\})|\\zeta \\rangle \\right]\\ ] ] @xmath248 \\,.\\ ] ] substituting the explicit form for @xmath249 yields the relation @xmath250|\\zeta \\rangle _ { 1,1}=\\delta _ { 0}\\frac{f(r)}r\\mbox{tr}\\left [ ( \\zeta \\hat\\tau_{2}-\\eta \\hat\\tau_{1})\\langle \\zeta |\\delta ( \\epsilon -\\hat{h}% _ a)|\\zeta \\rangle \\right ] .\\ ] ]          the parameter @xmath252 appearing in the above equation has the semiclassical interpretation as a c - number impact parameter . in this appendix we present approximations to the above equation for large values of the impact parameter , @xmath252 .    for @xmath253 we are justified to replace @xmath254 by its asymptotic value of unity .",
    "furthermore , making the somewhat crude approximation @xmath255 yields for the bound state @xmath256 this indicates that at large impact parameters , the bound states of the andreev equation are found very close to the threshold of the continuum .",
    "when required , more refined estimates may be obtained by writing @xmath257\\ ] ] and then performing a unitary transformation @xmath258 , @xmath259 , with @xmath260 $ ] to remove the phase from the order parameter .",
    "the transformed andreev equation is @xmath261 \\widetilde{\\psi } ( \\zeta ) = e\\widetilde{\\psi   } ( \\zeta ) \\,,\\ ] ] this is a one dimensional dirac equation with a weak scalar potential , which has weakly bound states with energies near @xmath262 .",
    "a `` non - relativistic '' treatment is appropriate in this case and we approximate the dirac equation by a schrdinger equation .",
    "for example , for @xmath263 we write @xmath264 with @xmath265 scalars .",
    "straightforward manipulations indicate that @xmath266 approximately obeys the schrdinger equation @xmath267 \\psi _ l(\\zeta ) = ( e-\\delta _ { 0})\\psi _ l(\\zeta ) .\\ ] ] all the machinery of schrdinger theory may be used on this equation to estimate e.g. the bound states .",
    "we can put a lower limit on the bound state energy .",
    "this may be obtained from the fact that the eigenvalues of the schrdinger operator are @xmath268 , the minimum of the potential .",
