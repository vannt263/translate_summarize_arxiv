    "the topological structure is one of the essential aspects of the gauge theory .",
    "in addition to its theoretical importance , it has phenomenological implications in particle physics such as the @xmath0 meson mass and the @xmath4 vacuum in qcd .",
    "although much is known in the instanton dilute gas approximation , in order to go beyond the level of qualitative understanding truly nonperturbative studies are required . for such purposes",
    "the lattice gauge theory should serve as a powerful tool , it has , however , been a nontrivial task to reproduce the topological structure since the naive lattice action does not preserve such properties .",
    "recently a new formulation of the lattice action , the ginsparg - wilson fermion @xcite , which realizes the exact chiral symmetry and the chiral anomaly has been proposed . thus it would be an opportunity for the lattice gauge theory to provide a quantitative study of the topological structure of the gauge theories using this new formalism .",
    "in this work we study the @xmath5 massive schwinger model using this new lattice formalism and the method developed in our previous work  @xcite . from the analytical studies of this model in the continuum space @xcite",
    ", it has been found that the pion mass and the chiral condensates at strong coupling and small @xmath4 behave as @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes a gauge coupling constant , @xmath8 is the fermion mass , @xmath9diag@xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 are numerical constants . although there has been extensive lattice studies on the massive schwinger model , they are limited to the scalar condensation @xmath13 and the @xmath0 meson masses in the @xmath14 vacuum @xcite .",
    "the lattice studies for the @xmath1 vacuum done so far are only those in the pure u(1 ) gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to compute the scalar and the pseudoscalar condensations @xmath13 , @xmath15 as well as the @xmath0 meson correlators @xmath16 for fixed topological charges and study how the practical lattice calculations reproduce physical quantities in the @xmath4 vacuum .    in section [ sec :",
    "simulation ] , we explain our method of simulations and how to evaluate the @xmath4 vacuum effects by reweighting .",
    "the results of the chiral condensation are presented in section [ sec : cond ] .",
    "the connection between the @xmath0 correlators and the chiral condensations in each sector are shown in section [ sec : etaeach ] . in section [ sec : etamass ] , we also present our result of the @xmath0 meson correlators in the @xmath4 vacuum . the summary and the discussion",

    "the gauge fields generated by this action satisfy lscher s bound ; @xmath22 those gauge fields which satisfy the above condition are called `` admissible '' .",
    "the `` admissible '' gauge fields have an exact topological charge defined as @xmath23 on the lattice if @xmath24 .",
    "this charge is never changed in the evolution in the hybrid monte carlo algorithm so that we can evaluate the observables in each sector separately .",
    "we take a @xmath25 lattice at @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "fermion mass is chosen as @xmath28 .",
    "fifty molecular dynamics steps with a step size @xmath29 are performed in one trajectory .",
    "configurations are updated every 10 trajectories . for each topological sector",
    ", around 500 trajectories are taken for the thermalization staring from the initial configuration which is the classical instanton solution with topological charge @xmath30 .",
    "we generate 300 configurations for each sector for the measurements and from 1000 to 10000 for the reweighting factors at various @xmath31 .",
    "the expectation value of an operator @xmath32 in the @xmath4 vacuum is expressed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the expectation value in the sector with @xmath30 at @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the reweighting factor ; @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the partition function in each sector , @xmath39 denotes the contribution from fermion determinants in the classical background with topological charge @xmath30 and @xmath40 is the action of the background .",
    "@xmath39 s are calculated by the householder method and the ql method .",
    "the integrals of @xmath41 which is defined as @xmath42 are evaluated by fitting the data with polynomials ( see fig .  [",

    "the smallest eigenvalues are consistent with exact zero at @xmath44 , which suggests that the index theorem is realized very well due to the smallness of the violation of chiral symmetries . as fig.[fig : rewfac ] indicates , we can ignore the contribution from large @xmath30 sectors .",

    "the total expectation values of them in the @xmath4 vacuum can be obtained by the following formula , @xmath54 in our practical calculation we truncate the sum over topological charge so that @xmath30 is restricted to be @xmath55 where @xmath56 for @xmath46 and @xmath57 for @xmath48 .",
    "the scalar and the pseudoscalar operators are defined as @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the size of the extra dimension of the domain - wall fermions . in order to increase the statistics , spatial averages are always taken for the expectation values of local operators .    the condensations in each topological sector @xmath60 and @xmath61 are plotted in fig.[fig : condq ] , where the numbers are given in tables  [ tab : psipsi ] , [ tab : psigammapsi ] .",
    "it is obvious that the @xmath30 dependence of @xmath62 is symmetric and that of @xmath61 is anti - symmetric , which can be understood from parity symmetry .",
    "the topological charge dependence of @xmath61 can be explained from the chiral anomaly equation given as @xmath63 taking expectation values in the fixed topological sector and making summations over the whole spacetime volume , one obtains the following relation @xmath64 which is in complete agreement with our lattice results .",
    "we also plot the `` reweighted '' condensations @xmath65 and @xmath66 in fig.[fig : condqrew ] .",
    "it is important to note that most of the contributions in @xmath67 come from @xmath68 sectors .",

    "we find that our lattice results give a good agreement with the analytic results , as was also the case in the previous lattice studies  @xcite .",

    "our lattice results show 30 % deviations from the analytic results .",
    "possible source of this discrepancies may be the discretization error or the error in the reweighting factor .",
    "the flavor singlet pseudoscalar meson @xmath0 is expected to be influenced by the topological properties of the vacuum . in qcd",
    ", the chiral anomaly gives a qualitative solution to the u(1 ) problem and it has been a long standing issue whether the mass gap between the flavor singlet and nonsinglet pseudoscalars can really be explained quantitatively from the lattice calculation . for this reason a number of unquenched lattice qcd simulations with @xmath5 to observe the mass gap  @xcite have been carried out .",
    "the massive schwinger model also has the mass gap between the flavor singlet and nonsinglet pseudoscalars due to the chiral anomaly .",
    "since it is a two - dimensional theory , the numerical cost is much smaller than qcd and the disconnected diagrams can be evaluated explicitly without relying on the noise method @xcite or the kuramashi s method @xcite . the @xmath0 meson mass in @xmath14 vacuum has been obtained using the overlap fermion  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 meson propagator is written as @xmath75 where the second term is so - called disconnected part .",
    "fig.[fig : etacorr ] shows the propagators in each topological sector @xmath76 .",
    "the result indicates the existence of long - range correlations .",
    "we evaluate them by fitting the data with the function @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the size of the lattice .",
    "we take @xmath79 for the fitting range , we have also checked that the change of the value of @xmath80 for different fitting range is small ( less than 5% ) .",
    "the data of @xmath80 in each topological sector are listed in table [ tab : longcrr ] .",
    "the results for @xmath81 are also plotted in fig.[fig : longq ] .",
    "we find that there is a long - range correlation even in @xmath82 sector .",
    "moreover , it is remarkable that it gives the largest contribution to the total expectation value in the @xmath4 vacuum .",
    "we would like to explain this phenomenon by clustering properties .",
    "consider the two operators put on @xmath83 and @xmath84 as fig.[fig : etacorfig ] .",
    "we expect that in the large volume limit the path integrals for the correlation functions in the volume @xmath85 can be expressed in terms of the chiral condensations as follows , @xmath86 where @xmath87 s denote the partition functions and @xmath88 means the expectation value in the region @xmath89 with volume @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) in which the gauge fields have a topological charge @xmath92 in that region . in @xmath82 case taking @xmath93",
    "we obtain @xmath94 where we assume @xmath95 , @xmath96 and we use the anti - symmetry ; @xmath97 as seen in eq.([anomaly ] ) and fig.[fig : condq ] .",
    "moreover , the @xmath30 dependence of the long - range correlations for large @xmath30 and the large volume limit can also be understood . in this limit , since @xmath30 , @xmath85 are extensive quantities , the free energy @xmath98 defined as @xmath99 which is another extensive quantity should be expressed as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is some unknown function . substituting eq.([free_enegy ] ) and approximating the sum over @xmath92 by the integral over @xmath92 , we obtain @xmath102 where we use eq.([anomaly ] )  ( see also fig.[fig : condq ] ) . in the large volume limit , the integral over @xmath92",
    "is dominated by @xmath103 , which minimizes the total free energy .",
    "we can evaluate the integral by integrating the fluctuations of @xmath92 around @xmath104 .",
    "changing variables as @xmath105 and expanding the free energy in @xmath106 to the second order , right hand side of eq.([longcorr_calc ] ) becomes @xmath107 where @xmath91 .",
    "performing the integral over @xmath106 to the first order we obtain @xmath108 the second term is indeed suppressed in the limit where both @xmath30 and the volume becomes large as expected .",
    "in fig.[fig : longq ] , we compare our lattice results on the @xmath30 dependence of the long - range correlation and the first term in eq.([lrcorr_prediction ] ) .",
    "it is surprising that this argument describes the results in fig.[fig : longq ] very well .",
    "thus we conclude that there is a relation between the long - range correlation of @xmath0 and the chiral condensations , which is understood by the clustering property of the theory based on the discussion of @xmath92 instantons in the half of the space and @xmath109 anti - instantons in the another half . here",
    "we would like to emphasize two points ;    * the @xmath0 meson has a long - range correlation in each topological sector even in @xmath82 case in spite of the fact that @xmath110 vanishes . * our lattice data at large @xmath30 satisfy the following relation , @xmath111 which can be explained by the clustering property .",
    "from the discussion in section [ sec : etaeach ] , we expect that the correlation of the @xmath0 meson in the @xmath4 vacuum is expressed by the following function , @xmath112 we plot the data of @xmath113 at @xmath114 in the left of fig.[fig : etaproptheta ] .",
    "fitting the data with eq.([eq : etatheta ] ) , we evaluate the @xmath0 meson mass and the long - range correlation @xmath115 .",
    "the fitting range is determined as @xmath116 from the effective mass at @xmath14 ( see fig.[fig : etaproptheta ] ) .    as fig.[fig",
    ": longcrrtheta ] and table [ tab : longcrrtheta ] show , the qualitative feature of the long - range correlations is consistent with @xmath117 at small @xmath8 .",
    "especially it is remarkable that our data show the cancellation of the long - range correlations in the @xmath3 vacuum at @xmath118 . on the other hand",
    ", we find that it is difficult to evaluate them precisely as @xmath8 increases since the @xmath30 dependence the operator is steep ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "in fact , the long - range correlation at @xmath120 gives 3.5 @xmath121 deviation from zero .",
    "this is because one gets contributions from larger number of topological sectors as shown in fig.[fig : longq ] so that the cancellation becomes more delicate .",
    "obviously the present level of accuracies for the reweighting factors @xmath36 and the condensation @xmath122 are not sufficient for larger masses .",
    "moreover , at @xmath123 the sectors with @xmath124 can not be ignored . in order to have a good control of the long - range correlation for larger masses",
    ", one has to reduce the statistical or systematic errors of @xmath36 and @xmath122 , while also evaluating higher topological sectors .",
    "the data of the @xmath0 meson mass are presented in fig.[fig : etamass ] .",
    "they have large statistical errors but we find that the @xmath0 meson is indeed heavier than the pion as predicted by the continuum theory .",
    "we investigate the chiral condensations and the @xmath0 meson propagators in each topological sector and in the @xmath4 vacuum .",
    "let us summarize the results as follows .    1",
    ".   the chiral condensations are nonzero in each sector , @xmath125 where the second equation is consistent with the anomaly equation .",
    "the total expectation values in the @xmath4 vacuum obtained by the reweighting method are qualitatively consistent with the results of the continuum theory .",
    "there actually exist the long - range correlations of the @xmath0 meson in each sector , @xmath126 even in @xmath82 case .",
    "it is also remarkable that our data show the following @xmath30 dependence of the long - range correlation as @xmath127 which can be explained by the clustering property .",
    "this means that the precise measurements of higher topological sectors are necessary to cancel the long - range correlation in the total expectation value at @xmath14 .",
    "thus the @xmath0 meson correlations in the @xmath4 vacuum should be treated as the following function , @xmath128 even in the @xmath14 vacuum .",
    "our results of @xmath115 and @xmath129 from the fit are qualitatively consistent with the continuum results as @xmath130 , although there are discrepancies at the quantitative level .",
    "it is now clear why the contribution from `` disconnected '' diagrams is very noisy .",
    "it is because each configuration gives the pseudoscalar condensation .",
    "they must be canceled at @xmath14 by parity symmetry .",
    "we should however take the existence into account since our simulation would have both of the systematic and statistical errors in the evaluation of the higher topological sectors .",
    "note that 4-dimensional qcd might have the same problems",
    ". it would be also important to investigate the topological effects on the @xmath131 condensation and the @xmath0 meson propagations in qcd .",
    "it should be stressed that the present lattice formalism of the chiral fermion already allows us to study the topological effects as a well defined problem in principle .",
    "although our method may be limited to two dimensions , it would be important to investigate some new efficient method or algorithm for the study of the topological effect in qcd .",
    "the authors would like to thank h.  matsufuru , t.  umeda , y.  kikukawa , s.hashimoto , y.aoki , k.  takahashi and t.  takimi for useful discussions and comments .",
    "the author also express special thanks to t.  izubuchi for crucial discussions on the relation between the chiral condensation and the anomaly equation .",
    "they would also like to acknowledge m. hamanaka and s.  sugimoto for informing us of the analytic results on instantons and the massive schwinger model .",
    "the authors thank the yukawa institute for theoretical physics at kyoto university , where this work was initiated during the yitp - w-02 - 15 on `` yitp school on lattice field theory '' .",
    "the numerical simulations were done on nec sx-5 at research center for nuclear physics in osaka university , and hitachi sr8000 model f1 supercomputer at kek .",
    "this work was supported in part by grant - in - aid for scientific research from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology of japan ( no.13135213 ) .",
    "they would also like to thank to yitp members for constant encouragements .",
    "in this appendix , we present our results of the topological susceptibility @xmath132 defined as @xmath133 the topological susceptibility is a useful measure of the topological fluctuations of the vacuum , which is extensively studied in qcd @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : chi ] indeed shows a mass dependence of @xmath132 which decreases towards the chiral limit somewhat faster than linearly in @xmath8",
    ". it would be interesting to compare it with the analytical results .",
    "recently , the topological susceptibility was also studied using the overlap fermion and staggered fermion @xcite , where they find @xmath132 decreases slower than linearly in @xmath8 when the leutwyler - smilga parameter @xmath134 is large .",
