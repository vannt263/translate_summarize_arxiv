    "a quantum system changes its groundstate properties in a fundamental way when quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) occur at absolute zero @xcite , which are induced by the change of external parameters or coupling constants and are driven by quantum fluctuations . in a finite system the discontinuity of the groundstate energy is often used to characterize the occurrence of qpts for there is an energy - level crossing at the critical point .",
    "we will show , in this paper , that such kind of phase transitions are usually accompanied by the change of symmetry characterized by conservative quantities such as the momentum which is the generator of translation .",
    "our investigations will relate to the quantum entanglement measured by the total concurrences @xcite .    actually , quantum critical points are governed by a diverging correlation length and there exists a very close relation between quantum correlation and quantum entanglement , which is known as the resource that enables quantum computation and communication .",
    "so exploring the role of entanglement in a phase transition has attracted great attention from both the communities of quantum computation and quantum statistics osterloh:02,osborne:02,jvidal:04a",

    "people have connected the theory of critical phenomena with quantum information by exploring the entangling resources of a system close to its quantum critical point .",
    "they demonstrate , for a class of magnetic systems or the interacting quantum lattice spin systems at zero temperature , that entanglement shows scaling behavior in the vicinity of the transition point where the level crossing occurs at degenerate groundstates @xcite .    from these studies we observe that the degeneracy of groundstates at the critical point may result in the uncertainty of entanglement .",
    "this fact means the discontinuity of concurrence in the vicinity of the phase transition point . such sudden change of the concurrence as the variation of an external parameter or coupling constant is vividly called the jump of concurrence .",
    "however , the groundstate energy - level crossing may not always result in a jump of a certain type of concurrence , such as the nnn or other pairwise concurrences . on the other hand ,",
    "this kind of qpts must be accompanied by a change of a certain conservative quantity , such as the momentum or the macroscopic magnetization .",
    "this observation may provide us a new way to find an appropriate definition of concurrence that just characterize the property of the quantum spin systems at the critical point .    in this paper , we consider a frustrated heisenberg ring system which contains rich phases in the ground state . to reveal the connection between the concurrence behavior and the symmetries of the separated phases around the critical point",

    "now we consider the behavior of groundstate energy as the variation of parameters @xmath11 and @xmath1 .",
    "for an infinite system , the energy - level crossing should induce the discontinuity of the derivative of groundstate energy @xmath16which is just the nn correlation function .",
