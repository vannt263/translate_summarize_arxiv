    "it was once claimed that in strong interaction physics `` spin is an inessential complication ''  @xcite .",
    "this rather negative attitude ignores certain practical applications and surely dismisses the beauty inherent in many phenomena involving particle polarisation .",
    "recognising this , a programme was outlined several years ago to exploit the possibilities of carrying out experiments with polarised beams and targets at anke  @xcite .",
    "this facility is based around a magnetic spectrometer sited at an internal target station of the cooler synchrotron and storage ring cosy of the forschungszentrum jlich .",
    "the basic features of the complex were described in ref .",
    "@xcite and we shall here concentrate on a few of the fruits of the spin programme .",
    "cosy can accelerate and store polarised protons and vector and tensor polarised deuterons up to momenta of 3.7  gev/@xmath3 .",
    "in addition to unpolarised hydrogen and deuterium cluster - jet targets , anke is also equipped with polarised @xmath4 and @xmath5 gas target cells so that spin correlations can be studied as well as beam and target analysing powers .    in the following three sections we first",
    "show how , in experiments with polarised deuteron beams at a storage ring , the beam momentum can be determined very precisely through the study of artificially induced depolarising resonances .",
    "this led to a determination of the mass of the @xmath0 meson that is as precise as any other in the literature .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon programme has two distinct elements , the most developed being the charge exchange of tensor polarised deuterons , which gives immediate access to the tensor amplitudes in large angle neutron - proton scattering .",
    "however , in addition , measurements are made in proton - proton elastic scattering with polarised beam and target in angular regions where little reliable data exist .",
    "finally , a variety of spin - dependent data on pion production in nucleon - nucleon collisions near threshold have been taken and analysed .",
    "these permitted a full partial - wave analysis to be carried out in the domain where two protons emerge almost bound .",
    "a big challenge that one often faces in a precision experiment at a storage ring is the determination of the beam momentum with sufficient accuracy .",
    "although the revolution frequency @xmath7 can be measured with a relative precision of around @xmath8 , there are much greater uncertainties in the exact orbit of the particles in the ring . a way of overcoming this problem",
    "was proposed many years ago  @xcite and has since been implemented at several electron colliders .",
    "spin is here very much the _ essential _ element .",
    "the spin of a polarised beam particle in a storage ring precesses around the normal to the plane of the machine . a horizontal _ rf _ field from a solenoid can induce depolarising resonances such that the beam depolarises when the frequency of the externally applied field coincides with that of the spin precession in the ring .",
    "the depolarising resonance frequency @xmath9 depends upon the revolution frequency of the machine and the kinematical factor @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are , respectively , the particle total energy and mass of the particle . for a planar accelerator where there are no horizontal fields , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the particle s gyromagnetic anomaly and @xmath15 is an integer .",
    "the combination of the measurements of the revolution and depolarising frequencies allows the evaluation of @xmath16 and hence the beam momentum @xmath17 .",
    "the depolarising resonance technique was applied for the first time at cosy with a vector polarised deuteron beam of momenta around 3.1  gev/@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the deuterons were accelerated with a _",
    "rf _ cavity and , once the required momentum was reached , a barrier bucket cavity was used to compensate for the energy losses incurred through the beam - target interactions .",
    "the depolarising solenoid had an integrated maximum longitudinal _",
    "_ magnetic field of @xmath18  tmm at a _ rf _ voltage of 5.7  kv rms .",
    "the value of @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ fr ] ) corresponds to frequencies that were in the middle of the solenoid range of 0.51.5  mhz .    a vector polarised beam leads to an asymmetry in the scattering from a carbon target , which could be measured with the edda detector  @xcite .",
    "since only the frequency of the depolarising resonance needed to be determined , an absolute calibration of this device at different deuteron momenta was not required .",
    "figure  [ fig : fr_begend ] displays an example of this relative polarisation as a function of the solenoid frequency for a fixed beam momentum . when the frequency of the solenoid coincides with the spin - precession frequency , the beam is maximally depolarised .",
    "the structures , especially the double peak in the centre , are caused by the interaction of the deuteron beam with the barrier bucket cavity .",
    "however , these did not affect the mean position , which could be fixed with a precision of @xmath20 .",
    "the full width at half maximum , which was typically in the region of 80 - 100  hz , is mainly a reflection of the momentum spread within the beam .",
    "if this were the only significant effect , it would correspond to @xmath21 .",
    "spin - resonance measurements at a single beam momentum ( closed circles ) .",
    "the open symbols represent results obtained for an extended cycle time , where the perturbing solenoid was switched on after 178  s. ]    the other frequency required in the evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ fr ] ) , i.e. , that of the circulation in cosy , was measured by using the schottky noise of the deuteron beam .",
    "the statistical distribution of the charged particles in the beam leads to random current fluctuations that induce a voltage signal at a beam pick - up in the ring .",
    "the fourier transform of this voltage - to - time signal by a spectrum analyser delivers the frequency distribution around the harmonics of the revolution frequency of the beam . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , this phenomenon is also used at cosy to measure the luminosity in an experiment  @xcite .",
    "all the data acquired at a particular beam momentum are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : f0_sc1fl1 ] . the small tail seen at low frequencies corresponds to beam particles that escaped the influence of the barrier bucket cavity but still circulated in cosy .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in the weighted arithmetic mean was in all cases below 0.2  hz compared to the typical 1.4  mhz shown in the figure .",
    "this means that , under ideal conditions , the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ fr ] ) could be measured with a precision of better than @xmath8 .",
    "mean schottky power spectrum at one beam momentum .",
    "the statistical error bars lie within the data points . ]",
    "the great efforts expended in determining precisely the deuteron beam momentum were justified in order to measure the mass of the @xmath0 meson from the missing - mass peak in the @xmath22he@xmath23 reaction  @xcite .",
    "for this purpose the experiment was carried out at twelve closely spaced deuteron momenta a little above the @xmath0 threshold and two just below to provide the information required to subtract the multipion background . by exploiting its full geometric acceptance near threshold , it was possible to calibrate the anke spectrometer very precisely and thus determine the final @xmath24he cm momentum @xmath25 for each of the twelve deuteron beam momenta and the results are shown in fig .",
    "although the method depends primarily upon the determination of the kinematics rather than counting rates , its implementation is helped enormously by the fact that the cross section jumps to its plateau value already by the first point in fig .",

    "the long lever arm facilitates a robust extrapolation to the @xmath0 threshold , where the deuteron momentum was found to be @xmath27  mev/@xmath3 .",
    "there is a one - to - one relation between this and the mass of the meson , which is found to be @xmath28 it is in fact the determination of the threshold beam momentum that provides the largest contribution to the 26  kev/@xmath29 systematic uncertainty .",
    "the result is compatible with all the modern measurements reported by the particle data group  @xcite that studied the @xmath0 decay and the error bars are as small as any of these .",
    "the result suggests that earlier missing - mass determinations , which differed by @xmath30  kev/@xmath29 , lacked the necessary precision .",
    "a good understanding of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath31 ) interaction still remains one of the principal goals of nuclear and hadronic physics .",
    "apart from their intrinsic importance for the study of nuclear forces , @xmath31 elastic scattering data are also necessary ingredients in the modeling of meson production and other nuclear reactions at intermediate energies .",
    "it therefore goes without saying that all facilities should try to fill in the remaining gaps in our knowledge in the area .",
    "the cosy - edda collaboration  @xcite produced a wealth of data on proton - proton elastic scattering that completely revolutionised the isospin @xmath32 @xmath31 phase - shift analysis up to about 2.1  gev  @xcite .",
    "however , for proton energies above about 1  gev , very little is known about the @xmath1 elastic differential cross section or analysing power for centre - of - mass angles @xmath33 .",
    "the cross section data that do exist seem to fall systematically below the predictions of the said partial wave analysis  @xcite . in this angular range",
    "the fast proton emerging at small angles from a hydrogen target can be measured well in the anke magnetic spectrometer , whereas the slow recoil proton emerging at large angles can be measured independently in one of the silicon tracking telescopes .",
    "the luminosity that is so crucial for the determination of the absolute cross sections can be determined using the schottky method  @xcite that was mentioned in the previous section .",
    "preliminary data are already available on the differential cross sections at eight energies and approval has been given to measure the proton analysing powers at the same energies .",
    "much greater effort has been made in the study of the spin - dependent terms in large angle neutron - proton scattering .",
    "it was pointed out many years ago that the @xmath34 charge exchange at small angles was very sensitive to the spin - spin terms in the @xmath35 amplitude provided the excitation energy @xmath36 in the final @xmath1 system was kept low  @xcite . under such conditions",
    "the @xmath37 is in a @xmath38 state and the charge exchange necessarily involves a spin flip from the initial @xmath39 spin - triplet of the deuteron .",
    "furthermore , measurements of the deuteron tensor analysing powers @xmath40 and @xmath41 allow one to distinguish between the contributions from the three spin - spin @xmath39 amplitudes .",

    "these have been extended in fine steps in momentum transfer @xmath45 to higher energy at anke  @xcite .",

    "it comes therefore as no surprise that , when the same approach is employed on the higher energy data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the current said amplitudes  @xcite give a poor overall description of the results .",
    "however , if the longitudinal spin - spin amplitude is multiplied by a global factor of 0.75 , the agreement is much more satisfactory .",

    "the message here is very similar to that for the other observables . at 600  mev per nucleon",

    "although the partial wave description of the pion production data is both plausible and impressive , one needs to measure other types of observables in order to test its validity . by using a polarised deuterium gas cell in conjunction with a polarised proton beam , it was possible to study the transverse spin - spin correlation in the @xmath79 reaction .",
    "the preliminary results are consistent with the predictions of the amplitude analysis discussed in sec .",
    "further checks could be made through measurements of the longitudinal - transverse spin correlation but these will require the delivery , installation , and commissioning of a siberian snake to rotate the proton spin .",
    "this should take place early in 2013 .",
    "the snake will also allow us to study the spin - correlation parameter @xmath80 in small angle @xmath1 elastic scattering .",
    "though the charge exchange programme with a polarised deuteron beam has been very successful , this only allows measurements to be carried out up to 1.15  gev per nucleon . to go higher at cosy",
    "we must work in inverse kinematics and use the polarised deuterium target in conjunction with a proton beam .",
    "the charge exchange can then be studied purely through the measurement of two slow protons in the silicon tracking telescopes without using the anke magnetic spectrometer at all . however , this opens even more fascinating possibilities , such as the study of @xmath52 isobar production in @xmath81 , where the spin alignment of the @xmath52 isobar can be determined through the measurement of one of the products of the @xmath82 decay . on the other hand , with its array of detectors",
