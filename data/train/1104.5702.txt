    "the more recent calculations of @xcite and @xcite include contributions from transitions to higher electronic states of heh@xmath7 , which are not considered in the current work . in most astrophysical environments , there are few photons at such short wavelengths so that our neglect of the higher electronic transitions is reasonable .",

    "given the ionization potentials of h and he and the binding energy of the @xmath76 level , the photodissociation threshold is 1123  , which is consistent with the current results .",

    "we note that our cross sections include results from rovibrational levels which are very near the dissociation limit for which there is , as yet , no experimental evidence in some cases .",

    "( [ siglte ] ) and ( [ part ] ) , @xmath94 and the binding energies @xmath95 are taken as positive quantities .",
    "we obtain partition functions in excellent agreement with those computed by @xcite for @xmath87=1 - 4000  k , but our values are somewhat smaller for higher temperatures .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] displays lte cross sections for the a@xmath0 photodissociation transition as a function of the wavelength for temperatures between @xmath5 and @xmath6  k as given by eq .",
    "( [ siglte ] ) .",
    "the threshold wavelength at 1129    corresponds to the asymptotic energy gap between the a  @xmath96 and x  @xmath96 electronic states . as the temperature increases , the cross section for wavelengths between @xmath97800 and 1129   increases dramatically , though the peak cross section near 500   decreases .",
    "in particular , for @xmath98  k , the cross section longward of the hydrogen lyman limit becomes significant .      for irradiated environments with photon wavelengths much greater than the lyman limit , photodissociation via pure rovibrational transitions",
    "may be dominant although the cross sections are typically small . for example , in figure [ fig6 ] , the partial cross section for rovibrational photodissociation in the x@xmath4 electronic state for @xmath99 is presented and comparison is made with the earlier calculations of @xcite . as for the a@xmath100x case , there is a significant shift in the threshold wavelength likely due to an inaccurate binding energy calculation in the earlier work .",
    "additional examples of rovibrational photodissociation for the x@xmath0 transition are given in figures [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] displays photodissociation from the ground rovibrational level ( @xmath101 ) which has a threshold of 6732    and a peak cross section magnitude that is @xmath9710@xmath102 times smaller than for the a@xmath103 electronic transition .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] also displays cross sections from @xmath77 and a selection of @xmath80 .",
    "orbiting resonances due to quasi - bound levels are evident for @xmath104 near thresholds .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] displays similar results , but for @xmath81 and a selection of @xmath105 .",
    "we are unaware of other previous rovibrational photodissociation calculations for heh@xmath7 .      assuming a boltzmann population distribution of rovibrational levels in the ground electronic state , lte cross sections are computed for gas temperatures between 500 and 5000  k. figure [ fig9 ] shows lte cross sections for the x@xmath0 photodissociation of heh@xmath1 as a function of the wavelength . for @xmath87 less than @xmath971000  k , the lte cross section peaks at a wavelength corresponding to the @xmath101 threshold .",
    "photons in this wavelength range are primarily responsible for photodestruction of heh@xmath106 . for higher temperatures ,",
    "the population in highly excited @xmath13 levels contributes substantially to the cross section increasing its value at large wavelength .",
    "the possible presence of heh@xmath7 in astrophysical environments was probably first discussed by @xcite , while early models of its abundance and emission lines in gaseous nebulae were performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite gave a comprehensive discussion of the mechanisms for the formation and destruction of heh@xmath106 in astrophysical plasmas .",
    "over the subsequent three decades , the role of heh@xmath7 has been considered in a variety of environments . @xcite and @xcite discussed the formation of heh@xmath7 in supernova ejecta , planetary nebulae , high-@xmath107 ly@xmath108 clouds , and broad - line clouds .",
    "searches for its rotational and vibrational emissions features , focusing on planetary nebula ngc 7027 , have so far been unsuccessful .",
    "however , @xcite proposed a tentative identification in the ejecta of supernova 1987a , but this has yet to be confirmed . here",
    "we discuss three environments in which heh@xmath7 is expected to have a significant abundance and the possible impact of the current photodissociation cross sections including the early universe , population iii objects , and protoplanetary disks .",
    "we do not provide photodissociation rates as they are sensitive to the properties of the local radiation field including its shape , intensity , and attenuation via the local dust and gas .",
    "instead , we provide cross sections to facilitate calculation of _ local _ photo - rates .    in the recombination era of the early universe , radiation from the cbr field",
    "can efficiently destroy heh@xmath106 through the x@xmath0 rovibrational transition until a redshift of @xmath109 .",
    "early universe chemical models typically obtain the destruction rate via detail balance from the radiative association rate coefficient .",
    "given that heh@xmath7 has a dipole moment , the cbr field will likely thermalize the rovibrational populations .",
    "the current results , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , could be used to improve such calculations by directly obtaining the photodissociation rate due to the cbr field . for illustrative purposes , both the x@xmath67x and a@xmath67x lte cross sections for a gas temperature of 1000  k",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] and compared to blackbody radiation curves for a number of radiation temperatures @xmath110 .",
    "for @xmath107 between @xmath971000 and 300 ( @xmath1113000 and 1000 k ) , the x@xmath67x transition dominates the photodissociation , but for higher @xmath107 the a@xmath67x transition will become important ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , though it is neglected in current models . for @xmath112",
    ", models predict a plateau in the heh@xmath7 abundance .",
    "while the abundance at this redshift is small , it would likely be further suppressed due to photodissociation via the a@xmath67x transition .    in @xcite , we considered the photodetachment of h@xmath113 due to far uv ( fuv ) sources prior to the reionization epoch including population iii ( pop iii ) stars and the high-@xmath107 intergalactic medium ( igm ) radiation field .",
    "once a pop iii star is formed , the heh@xmath106 present in its primordial halo , which consists of baryonic and dark matter , will be exposed to an intense fuv stellar radiation field . as pop iii stars",
    "are expected to be massive , they will emit essentially blackbody radiation with effective temperatures @xmath114 between @xmath9730,000 and 10@xmath102  k @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] illustrates that pop iii stellar radiation will photodissociate heh@xmath7 through both the a@xmath0 and x@xmath0 transitions with the a@xmath67x contribution increasing with @xmath114 .",
    "@xcite computed a@xmath67x photodissociation rates for @xmath115 k for complete blackbodies and with a 24.6 ev cut - off accounting for he i continuum opacity . however , the pop iii fuv radiation will carve - out a surrounding h ii region resulting in a 13.6 ev cut - off at the lyman limit ( reducing the rate ) , but the densities in the molecular region may be high enough for the heh@xmath7 level populations to approach a thermal distribution . the latter effect is likely to increase the rate , as suggested by figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig10 ] , since @xcite only considered photodissociation from @xmath116 .",
    "further , the b@xmath67x , c@xmath67x , and higher electronic transitions will play little role due to lyman limit or he i cut - offs . on the other hand ,",
    "the high - redshift igm radiation field is expected to have a lyman limit cut - off , to be modulated by h i resonant absorption , and to behave as a power - law at longer wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , so that heh@xmath7 present in the outer molecular regions of primordial halos exposed to the igm field would be photodissociated primarily through the x@xmath0 transition .",
    "photoprocesses are known to have a significant influence on molecular gas in protoplanetary disks as they are exposed to intense uv radiation from the young star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the accretion disk @xcite and to infrared radiation from dust grains ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as pointed out by @xcite , the environment of a protoplanetary disk is likely to be vastly different from average interstellar conditions including i ) dust grains with different sizes and properties , ii ) varying spectral shapes of the incident uv radiation , iii ) higher intensity radiation , and other factors .",
    "therefore , pre - computed photo - rates can not be readily applied .",
    "the gas temperature is typically @xmath9750  k in the mid - plane , but increases with height and towards the star , reaching a few 1000 k in the inner disk .",
    "the dust temperature decreases from @xmath97400  k in the inner disk to @xmath97100 k in the mid - plane of the outer disk @xcite .",
    "effective stellar temperatures range from 4000  k for a t tauri star to @xmath9730,000  k @xcite , while the accretion shock radiation is expected to approach the lyman limit with intensities @xmath117 to @xmath118 that of the standard interstellar radiation field @xcite . for the high densities ( @xmath119 to @xmath118 @xmath120 ) in the disk , the heh@xmath7 rovibrational populations",
    "would be expected to be thermalized so that lte photodissociation cross sections would be appropriate . while @xcite mention that heh@xmath7 can not be photodissociated , figure [ fig10 ] suggests that photodissociation can occur due to dust and cooler stellar radiation through the x@xmath67x transition .",
    "hotter stars , and in particular the intense accretion radiation , may dominate the photodissociation rate through the a@xmath67x transition shortward of 1129   . however , intense ly@xmath108 , from t tauri stars , which may contribute to the photodissociation of other molecular , will have a negligible effect for heh@xmath7 .",
    "using ab initio potentials and dipole moment functions , accurate cross section calculations have been performed for the photodissociation of heh@xmath1 through the a@xmath121 and x@xmath121 transitions .",
    "the partial cross sections have been evaluated for all the rotational transitions from the vibrational levels @xmath2 of the x@xmath122 electronic state .",
    "lte cross sections are also calculated for temperatures between @xmath5 and @xmath6  k. the resulting cross sections are applicable to the destruction of heh@xmath1 in the early universe and in uv irradiated molecular regions including primordial halos , photodissociation regions , and protoplanetary disks . to facilitate the calculation of local photo - rates for particular astrophysical environments",
