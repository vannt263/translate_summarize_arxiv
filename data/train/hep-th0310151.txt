    "the definition of energy - momentum has always been a focus of many investigations in general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "this , together with conservation laws , has a crucial role in any physical theory .",
    "however , there is still no accepted definition of energy - momentum , and generally speaking , of conserved quantities associated with the gravitational field .",
    "the main difficulty is with the expression which defines the gravitational field energy part .",
    "einstein used principle of equivalence and conservation laws of energy - momentum to formulate the covariant field equations .",
    "he formulated the energy - momentum conservation law in the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the stress energy density of matter .",
    "he identified @xmath3 as representing the stress energy density of gravitation .",
    "he noted that @xmath3 was not a tensor , but concluded that the above equations hold good in all coordinate systems since they were directly obtained from the principle of gr .",
    "the choice of a non - tensorial quantity to describe the gravitational field energy immediately attracted some criticism .",
    "the problems associated with einstein s pseudo - tensor resulted in many alternative definitions of energy , momentum and angular momentum being proposed for a general relativistic system .",
    "these include landau - lifshitz@xmath4 , tolman@xmath5 , papapetrou@xmath6 , bergmann@xmath7 , weinberg@xmath8 who had suggested different expressions for the energy - momentum distribution .",
    "the main problem with these definitions is that they are coordinate dependent .",
    "one can have meaningful results only when calculations are performed in cartesian coordinates .",
    "this restriction of coordinate dependent motivated some other physicists like m@xmath0ller@xmath9 , komar@xmath10 and penrose@xmath11 who constructed coordinate independent definitions of energy - momentum complex .",
    "m@xmath0ller claimed that his expression gives the same values for the total energy and momentum as the einstein s energy - momentum complex for a closed system .",
    "however , m@xmath0ller s energy - momentum complex was subjected to some criticism@xmath12 .",
    "komar s prescription , though not restricted to the use of cartesian coordinates , is not applicable to non - static spacetimes .",
    "penrose@xmath11 pointed out that quasi - local masses are conceptually very important .",
    "however , different definitions of quasi - local masses do not give agreed results for the reissner - nordstrom and kerr metrics and that the penrose definition could not succeed to deal with the kerr . these inadequacies of quasi - local definitions have been discussed in a series of papers@xmath13 .",
    "thus each of these energy - momentum complex has its own drawback . as a result these ideas of the energy - momentum complex were severally criticized .",
    "virbhadra@xmath14 revived the interest in this approach by showing that different energy - momentum complexes can give the same energy - momentum . since then lot of work on evaluating the energy - momentum distributions of different spacetimes have been carried out by different authors@xmath15 . in a recent paper , virbhadhra@xmath16 used the energy - momentum complexes of einstein , landau - lifshitz , papapetrou and weinberg ( ellpw ) to investigate whether or not they can give the same energy distribution for the most general non - static spherically symmetric metric .",
    "it was a great surprise that contrary to previous results of many asymptotically flat spacetimes and asymptotically non - flat spacetimes , he found that these definitions disagree .",
    "he observed that einstein s energy - momentum complex provides a consistent result for the schwarzschild metric whether one calculates in kerr - schild cartesian coordinates or schwarzschild cartesian coordinates .",
    "the prescriptions of landau - lifshitz , papapetrou and weinberg furnish the same result as in the einstein prescription if the calculations are carried out in schwarzschild cartesian coordinates .",
    "thus the prescriptions of landau - lifshitz , papapetrou and weinberg do not give a consistent result .",
    "on the basis of these and some other facts@xmath17 , virbhadra concluded that the einstein method seems to be the best among all known ( including quasi - local mass definitions ) for energy distribution in a spacetime .",
    "recently , lessner@xmath18 pointed out that the m@xmath0ller s energy - momentum prescription is a powerful concept of energy and momentum in gr .",
    "it has been shown recently@xmath16 that ellpw energy - momentum complexes coincide for any kerr - schild class metric when one uses kerr - schild cartesian coordinates . in this paper",
    "we use ellpw and m@xmath0ller energy - momentum complexes to obtain the energy distribution of a regular black hole which is represented by a bardeen s model@xmath19 .",
    "it is shown that ellpw energy - momentum complexes give the same and acceptable results for a given space - time .",
    "our results agree with virbhadra s conclusion that the einstein s energy - momentum complex is still the best tool for obtaining energy distribution in a given spacetime .",
    "this also supports cooperstock s hypothesis ( that energy and momentum in a curved space - time are confined to the the regions of non - vanishing energy - momentum of matter and the non - gravitational field ) .",
    "the paper has been organised as follows . in the next section",
    ", we shall describe the regular black holes .",
    "in secs . 3 and 4 ,",
    "we evaluate energy distribution using ellpw and m@xmath0ller s prescriptions respectively .",
    "finally , we shall discuss the results .",
    "in 1968 , bardeen@xmath20 constructed a well - known model called bardeen s model .",
    "this model represents a regular black hole obeying the weak energy condition , and it was powerful in shaping the direction of research on the existence or avoidance of singularities .",
    "the model uses the reissner - nordstr@xmath0 m spacetime as inspiration .",
    "the metric expressed in standard spherical coordinates @xmath21 is given by the line element of the form @xmath22 where bardeen replaced the usual reissner - nordstr@xmath0 m function @xmath23 by @xmath24 when @xmath25 in bardeen s model , there is an event horizon .",
    "there are values @xmath26 of @xmath27 such that the region @xmath28 contains trapped surfaces .",
    "the spacetime obeys the null convergence , yet it contains no physical singularities .",
    "it is to be noticed that if we take charge @xmath29 , the above metric reduces to the schwarzschild metric .",
    "in this section we shall use ellpw energy - momentum complexes to evaluate the energy distribution of the regular black hole . to this end , we shall follow the procedure developed by virbhadra@xmath16 . the basic requirement of the procedure is to bring the metric in the form of kerr - schild class and then transform the resulting metric in kerr - schild cartesian coordinates .",
    "the metrics of the kerr - schild class are written in the following form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the minkowski spacetime , @xmath32 is the scalar field and @xmath33 is a null , geodesic and shear free vector field in the minkowski metric .",
    "these can be expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "it is to be noticed that , for the kerr - schild class metric , the vector field @xmath33 remains null , geodesic and shear free with the metric @xmath36 .",
    "thus it follows from the above equation that @xmath37    now we bring the metric given by eq.(2 ) in kerr - schild class by using the following coordinate transformation @xmath38 which implies that @xmath39 this metric turns out to be static case of the kerr - schild class as given by aguirregabiria et al.@xmath16 .    in order to have meaningful results in the prescriptions of ellpw ,",
    "it is necessary to transform the metric in kerr - schild cartesian coordinates .",
    "let us now transform the metric in kerr - schild cartesian coordinates by using @xmath40 the corresponding metric in these coordinates will become @xmath41 ^ 2.\\ ] ] this is the kerr - schild class metric with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we use the procedure of aguirregabiria et al.@xmath16 to calculate energy distribution of the regular black hole in the ellpw prescriptions .",
    "it turns out that we get the same energy in these prescriptions which is given as @xmath44 when we replace the value of @xmath45 from eq.(4 ) , it follows that the energy distribution of the regular black hole is @xmath46 which can be written as follows @xmath47 if we take the charge @xmath29 or at large distances , it reduces to the energy of the schwarzscild metric given by @xmath48",
    "now we shall use m@xmath0ller s energy - momentum complex to evaluate energy of the regular black hole .",
    "this is the beauty of m@xmath0ller s method that it is independent of coordinates and consequently we can perform computations in spherical polar coordinates .",
    "the energy - momentum complex of m@xmath0ller@xmath9 is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 the energy - momentum complex satisfies the local conservation laws @xmath51 the locally conserved energy - momentum complex @xmath52 contains contributions from the matter , non - gravitational and gravitational fields .",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 are the energy and momentum ( energy current ) density components respectively .",
    "the energy and momentum components are given as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the energy and @xmath57 represent the momentum components . using gauss s theorem , the energy expression e can be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the outward unit normal vector over an infintesimal surface element @xmath60 .    the only required component of @xmath61 , to evaluate energy of the bardeen s model , is given by @xmath62 substituting this value of @xmath63 in eq.(19 ) , we have the following energy distribution in m@xmath0ller s prescription @xmath64 which can be written as @xmath65 we see that the energy expression for ellpw and m@xmath0ller s prescriptions coincide at large distances .",
    "they are exactly the same for the schwarzschild metric .",
    "there are two types of energy - momentum complexes in the literature .",
    "the first type depends on the coordinates and the other type is independent of coordinate .",
    "however , it has been shown by many authors that the first type give more meaning results .",
    "the debate on the localization of energy - momentum is also an interesting and a controversial problem . according to misner et al@xmath66",
    ", energy can only be localized for spherical systems .",
    "however , cooperstock and sarracino@xmath67 suggested that if energy can be localized in spherical systems then it can be localized in any spacetimes .",
    "the energy - momentum complexes are non - tensorial under general coordinate transformations and hence are restricted to cartesian coordinates only . in their recent work virbhadra and his collaborators@xmath68 have shown that different energy - momentum complexes can provide meaningful results .    in this paper , we have evaluated energy of the regular black hole using prescriptions of ellpw .",
    "it is worth noting that the energy turns out to be same in the prescriptions of einstein , landau - lifshitz , papapetrou and weinberg .",
    "it is clear that the definitions of elppw support the cooperstock hypothesis for the regular black hole .",
    "we have also calculated this quantity using m@xmath0ller energy - momentum complex .",
    "this is not exactly the same as evaluated by using ellpw prescriptions .",
    "however , it can be seen from eqs.(14 ) and ( 23 ) that , at large distances , these give the same result and reduces to the energy of schwarzscild spacetime ."
