    "although there is much debate in the literature about the specific formation channel(s ) for low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , the `` standard '' scenario requires a `` common - envelope '' phase , prior to the compact object formation , in order to produce a tight binary @xcite .",
    "this scenario may work for lmxbs containing neutron stars .",
    "however , black hole ( bh ) lmxbs , which are the focus of this letter , pose a significant challenge to this paradigm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "lmxbs are abundant in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but their individual properties can only be determined in the galactic population . to date , the accretors of 17 galactic lmxbs have been dynamically confirmed to be bh - lmxbs @xcite .",
    "about half ( 9 out of 17 ) of the galactic bh - lmxbs have tight orbits ( @xmath6 ) and low - mass ( @xmath7 ) main - sequence or sub - giant companions @xcite .",
    "mass - transfer from the lower  mass component of a binary to the more massive one leads to the expansion of the orbit , so an additional angular momentum loss mechanism is needed in order for the 9 galactic compact bh - lmxbs to evolve to their currently observed short periods .",
    "this mechanism is traditionally thought to be magnetic braking ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is believed to operate only in stars less massive than ( @xmath8 ) , as they have a substantial outer convective zone where the dynamo effect can operate and produce the necessary magnetic fields .",
    "hence , the initial companion mass in these systems must have been @xmath9 .",
    "within the standard formation channel explained above , it is unclear how a binary whose primary star is massive enough to form a bh and whose secondary is less massive than @xmath8 can survive the common - envelope phase without merging @xcite .",
    "considering the energy budget of the system  @xcite and taking into account all possible sources of energy that can help unbind the envelope of the primary star ( e.g. , internal energy , recombination energy and enthalpy of the primary s envelope ) , one finds that a secondary less massive than @xmath10 does not provide enough orbital energy to unbind the envelope of a bh progenitor @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we propose an alternative formation channel for compact bh - lmxbs that skips the common - envelope phase all together .",
    "we show that bh - lmxbs can form due to hierarchical triple - body dynamics , in combination with general relativity ( gr ) , tidal forces and post - main - sequence stellar evolution .",
    "the latter includes mass loss , magnetic breaking , expansion of stellar radii and supernova ( sn ) dynamics .",
    "it is likely that at least some bh - lmxb progenitors originated in a triple configuration , as most massive stars reside in binaries and higher multiples ( @xmath11 of all oba spectral type stars @xcite ) . from dynamical stability",
    "arguments these triple stars must be in hierarchical configurations , where the inner binary is orbited by a third body on a much wider orbit .",
    "interestingly , a substantial number of close binaries with an accreting compact object , mainly lmxbs and their descendants ( e.g. , millisecond radio pulsars ) , are known or suspected triples @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite estimated that the most efficient formation channel for black hole  white dwarf x - ray binaries in dense globular clusters may involve dynamically formed triples .    the study of these hierarchical triples can be done in the secular approximation regime ( i.e. , phase averaged , long - term evolution ) .",
    "we specifically use the `` eccentric kozai - lidov '' ( ekl ) mechanism @xcite . in the octupole - level of approximation",
    ", the inner orbital eccentricity can reach very high values @xcite .",
    "when coupled with angular - momentum loss mechanisms , like tidal friction , the ekl mechanism can efficiently reduce the orbital separation of the inner binary @xcite , and initiate a mass - transfer phase .",
    "thus , forming a bh - lmxb without the need for a common envelope .",
    "the rest of this letter is organized as follows : we begin by describing the numerical setup ( section [ ics ] ) , we then describe the results and specifically the lmxb formation scenarios ( section [ sec : formation ] ) and finally we discuss our results in section [ sec : dis ] .",
    "we study the secular dynamical evolution of triple stars up to the octupole - level of approximation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including tidal effects ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and gr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) effects for both the inner and outer orbits .",
    "tidal interactions operate only on the companion star to the bh , and we adopt a constant viscous time of @xmath12  yr , similar to @xcite .",
    "different viscous time assumptions will result in slight variations in the timescales as well as the relative contribution of each formation scenario .",
    "one of the novel additions here is that we account for the effects of stellar evolution in our calculations .",
    "this includes mass loss , the evolution of the stellar radii and the sn of the primary star .",
    "we use the sse @xcite stellar evolution code to evolve each individual star .    in all of our simulations ,",
    "we require orbital initial conditions that satisfy dynamical stability , such that the hierarchical secular treatment is justified .",
    "the first condition is long - term stability of the triple , in which we follow the @xcite criterion : @xmath13 the second criterion is : @xmath14 where @xmath15 measures the relative amplitudes of the octupole and quadrupole terms in the triple s hamiltonian .",
    "this is numerically similar to the stability criterion , equation  ( [ eq : mar ] ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we set @xmath16 , where the mass of the resulting bh is @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we choose @xmath18 from a uniform distribution in the range of @xmath19 , so the final inner binary can be considered as a lmxb .",
    "a more massive tertiary will result in expanding the outer orbit due to mass loss rather quickly , reducing the strength of the ekl effects .",
    "a less massive tertiary will result in suppression of the eccentricity excitation @xcite .",
    "thus , we choose @xmath20 from a uniform distribution between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we choose the inner orbit semi - major axis , @xmath23 , from a distribution that is uniform in the log between @xmath24  au ) and @xmath25  au .",
    "the upper limit represents the widest binaries in the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the lower limit is such as to avoid mass transfer before the sn , and allow ekl precession to be faster than gr .",
    "we choose the inner ( outer ) orbit eccentricity , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , from a uniform distribution between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , following @xcite .",
    "our stability requirements ( see below ) , effectively reduce this distribution to be roughly uniform between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , see figure [ fig : postsn ] .     from the initial condition",
    "end up in a post - sn stable hierarchical configuration . ]",
    "we choose the outer orbit semi - major axis , @xmath32 , from a uniform distribution in the log between @xmath33 and @xmath34  au ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we choose @xmath33 to be the maximum value from either setting @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsilon ] ) , the @xcite criteria ( eq .  [ eq : mar ] ) , or requiring the quadrupole timescale to be @xmath36  myrs , which is the time at which @xmath37 will go sn . this way we guarantee that the triple configuration will not excite a large eccentricity in the inner orbit before the sn .",
    "we should note that we do not take into account here any asymmetries in the sn explosion , as the analysis of the formation history of galactic bh - lmxbs shows that a sn kick is not required for most of the systems @xcite .",
    "we start by following the evolution of the inner binary using bse @xcite , up to the sn of @xmath37 .",
    "this allows @xmath37 to lose mass adiabatically up to a mass of @xmath38  m@xmath39 which causes both orbits to expand .",
    "the orbital phase when the star goes sn is chosen from a uniform distribution and we assume momentum conservation to calculate the new eccentricities ( assuming no sn kick ) . we find that about @xmath40 of our initial systems either undergo a common envelope prior to the sn or get disrupted by the sn , or simply become unstable according to our criteria in equations ( [ eq : mar ] ) and ( [ eq : epsilon ] ) .",
    "we then consider the post - sn stable triples and assume an isotropic distribution for the initial inclination angle ( i.e. , uniform in @xmath41 ) , where we denote the inclination angle of the inner ( outer ) orbit with respect to the total angular momentum by @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , so that the mutual inclination between the two orbits is @xmath44 .",
    "the inner and outer arguments of periapsis are drawn , respectively , from a uniform distribution .    in figure",
    "[ fig : postsn ] we show the results of the sn on the different orbital parameters ( specifically on @xmath45 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "the sn tends to widen the orbit and , thus , reduce the strength of the octupole - level of approximation effects .",
    "furthermore , the eccentric orbits are more likely to be disrupted by the sn or become unstable .",
    "during the ekl evolution , the inner orbit eccentricity is excited , which can result in crossing of the roche limit .",
    "following @xcite , we define the dimensionless number @xmath46 the roche limit is then defined by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the radius of the star . in our simulations , if the bh - companion star pericenter distance @xmath49 becomes smaller than @xmath50 we assume that the star will overflow its roche lobe .",
    "we stop the calculation here and identify this system as a lmxb candidate .    ) and eccentricity ( as @xmath51 ) , respectively , at the onset of rlo , as functions of the inner orbital separation .",
    "the color code is the formation time ( in logarithmic scale ) .",
    "the inset at the bottom panel shows the period distribution associated with the inner binary at rlo ( black line ) , and the distribution of the circularization orbital period , assuming that the orbit was instantly circularized at the onset of rlo to an orbit with @xmath52 ( blue dashed line ) . ]",
    "we denote the parameters of systems that cross their roche limit with the subscript  rlo \" ( roche lobe overflow ) . in total , we follow the evolution of 2601 post - sn hierarchical triple systems for @xmath53  gyr , covering the initial parameter space described in section  [ ics ] .",
    "we find a little more than @xmath54 of our runs to be lmxb candidates . of these ,",
    "we identify three formation channels and show an example evolutionary sequence for each one of them in figure  [ fig : ex ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : innerfinalv2 ] shows the distribution of orbital properties of our population of lmxb candidates , for the inner orbit , at the onset of rlo .",
    "the three formation channels of our lmxb candidates can be easily distinguished in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : innerfinalv2 ] .",
    "the three channels are :    * *  eccentric \" : * the majority ( @xmath0 ) of our lmxb candidates cross their roche limit when their inner orbit reaches an extremely high eccentricity ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "this takes place on a shorter time scale than the typical extra precession timescale ( such as tides , rotational bulge , and the gr precession timescales ) , and the orbit becomes almost radial .",
    "a typical rlo timescale is on the order of @xmath56 , while both @xmath18 and @xmath20 are on the main sequence ( see figure  [ fig : ex ] , left panel , and figure  [ fig : innerfinalv2 ] ) .",
    "we note that numerically resolving the maximum eccentricity requires very small time steps .",
    "furthermore , due to the chaotic nature of the system , and the limitation of the double averaging method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we probably underestimate the maximum eccentricity reached in many of these high peaks .",
    "hence , the overall number of systems that reaches rlo may be higher , and the true distribution of rlo times may be shifted to slightly shorter values than depicted in figure [ fig : innerfinalv2 ] .",
    "we note that about @xmath57 of the systems reach such high eccentricities to significantly violate the double averaging procedure ( order of magnitude violation of equation ( 18 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "this may cause even larger eccentricities , which can lead to a head - on collision between the star and the bh . * *  giants \" : * in the second class of systems ( @xmath1 ) , the inner orbit does not reach the same extreme eccentricities for the inner binary to reach rlo .",
    "the inner bh - companion star eventually evolves to become a giant star , and it is at that point that it fills its roche - lobe , generally still at a highly eccentric orbit ( @xmath58 ) . as shown in the example depicted in the middle panels of figure  [ fig : ex ] ,",
    "after the outer star lost its mass , the eccentricity oscillations slowed down ( labeled `` slower ekl '' in the figure ) , but still continued to be excited to somewhat large values . in the first stellar expansion episode , tides shrank the inner orbit s semi - major axis , which then expanded again due to mass loss in the red giant and agb phase . in the second expansion episode , @xmath23 reduced dramatically , resulting in a `` lucky '' rlo .",
    "* *  classical \" : * finally , we identify a classical class of lmxbs ( @xmath2 ) , where tides play a dominant role . in this case",
    ", the eccentricity excitations are large and are gradual enough that tidal and magnetic braking effects can shrink and circularize the inner orbit at orbital periods of @xmath59  d. as depicted in the right panels of figure  [ fig : ex ] , the system reached rlo at @xmath60140 myr , typical of the order 100 myr timescale after the bh formation inferred from figure [ fig : innerfinalv2 ] ( for our given choice of viscous time ) .    as expected from the ekl mechanism , in our models the lmxb candidates form preferentially in systems with initial inclinations between the inner and the outer orbit close to @xmath61 , and with a larger range of mutual inclination , for stronger octupole contribution ( see bottom right panel in figure [ fig : foutinal ] ) .",
    "the middle right panel in figure [ fig : foutinal ] shows that modeled lmxb candidates are more likely to be found in triple systems with eccentric outer orbits , which translates to larger octupole strengths [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsilon ] ) ] .",
    "note that the initial mutual inclination is not conserved ( as depicted in the bottom left panel in figure [ fig : foutinal ] ) , similarly to @xcite .    finally , bh ",
    "white - dwarf binaries that survive to the end of 10  gyr of evolution without rlof are typically on wide orbits ( denoted as `` no rlo '' in figure  [ fig : foutinal ] , and with a minimum separation of @xmath62  au , see top left panel ) .",
    "their white - dwarf tertiaries are also on a wide orbits ( top right panel in figure  [ fig : foutinal ] ) and most likely will become unbound due to galactic tides @xcite or collisions with single stars in the field @xcite .    , @xmath26 , and the mutual inclination @xmath63 ; left panels , top to bottom show @xmath32 , @xmath27 .",
    "the bottom right panel shows the post - sn mutual inclination as a function of the octupole strength ( @xmath15 ) , where for clarity we omit systems that do not undergo rlo . ]",
    "we study the formation of bh - lmxbs through secular three - body interactions .",
    "we consider the octupole - level of approximation of the hierarchical three - body problem , including gr , tidal effects and post main - sequence stellar evolution , which includes mass loss , inflation of stellar radii and sn for the bh progenitor .",
    "we run a large monte - carlo sample of simulations ( 2601 ) , of which about @xmath54 overflow their roche lobe and become lmxb candidates .",
    "we identify three distinct formation channels for lmxb candidates , which we label as `` eccentric , '' `` giant '' and `` classical '' .",
    "the `` eccentric '' channel describes systems for which their eccentricity is excited to extremely large values ( at rlo @xmath64 ) , their orbit becomes almost radial and they fill their roche lobe .",
    "this scenario represents the majority of our simulated systems ( @xmath0 ) . due to the large eccentricity and the wide inner orbit , the fate of these systems after the onset of rlo is somewhat uncertain .",
    "we speculate that ejecta from non - conservative mass - transfer during periastron rlo will form a circumbinary disk which may in turn help , through tidal interaction , to quickly circularize the inner orbit .    the `` giants '' formation channel represents a unique combination of ekl and stellar evolution ( @xmath1 from all lmxbs ) .",
    "since the remaining life of the evolved donor star is short , the lifetime of the x - ray bright phase is expected to be short ( @xmath60few myrs ) , and hence the contribution of this scenario to the observed bh - lmxb population is probably limited .",
    "both the `` eccentric '' and `` giants '' formation scenarios take place during high eccentricity peaks . @xcite studied the effect of rlo mass - transfer in eccentric binary orbits , assuming a @xmath65 mass - transfer rate at periastron .",
    "they found that for mass ratios we consider here , the circularization timescale due to the mass - transfer is on the order of @xmath66 .",
    "however , their analysis does not include the forced eccentricity oscillations due to a third body or post - main - sequence donors , which we expect will affect the overall dynamics of such systems .",
    "systems that follow the `` classical '' scenario ( @xmath2 of lmxb candidates in our simulations ) form compact lmxbs , with properties similar to the observed ones of galactic compact bh - lmxbs @xcite and similar to the theoretically estimated properties at the onset of rlo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the tertiary companion of such a bh - lmxb is expected to be a white dwarf at a large orbital separation , on the order of several thousand au , which renders them effectively undetectable .",
    "the lifetimes of these systems in the lmxb phase are expected to be on the order of a gyr , however , their formation timescale is @xmath67yr ( as deduced from the colors in figure [ fig : innerfinalv2 ] ) , in contrast to @xmath60gyrs formation timescales predicted by the standard formation channel from primordial binaries @xcite .",
    "the `` classical '' formation channel is the least efficient one in our monte - carlo simulations ; however , its efficiency is strongly dependent on the assumed strength of the tidal forces , and hence it is difficult to accurately estimate its relative contribution .    finally , we estimate the current number of bh - lmxb that may exist in a galaxy such as the milky way , as @xmath68 for all formation channels combined . the latter number becomes @xmath69 if we consider only the `` classical '' scenario . in the above equation , we assumed that @xmath70 of all massive stars are in triples , and the inner binaries initially have a flat mass ratio distribution @xcite .",
    "the fraction of stars with mass above @xmath71 is drawn from a @xcite imf ( @xmath72 ) , @xmath73 is the fraction of systems with the inner binary separation assumed in our initial conditions , @xmath74 is the fraction of systems with the mass ratio used in our simulations . finally , @xmath75 is the efficiency of ekl mechanism , estimated for all channels to be @xmath76 , while for the classical scenario it is @xmath77 .",
    "the assumption here is that the lifetime of all bh - lmbx is @xmath78  gyr , however , this may not be the case for all channels .",
    "a proper comparison with the observed population should take into account the transient behavior of lmxbs , as well as the selection effects .",
