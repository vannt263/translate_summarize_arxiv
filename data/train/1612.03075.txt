    "in order to extend our knowledge of the nucleon structure , we need to access the three - dimensional picture of neutron and proton in terms of the degrees of freedom of their constituents .",
    "information on the three - dimensional momentum space of the nucleon can be obtained extracting the quark transverse momentum distributions ( tmds ) @xcite from the so - called single spin asymmetries ( ssas ) , which can be measured in polarized semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) .",
    "indeed , by exploiting sidis off transversely polarized target the sivers and collins contributions can be selected @xcite , showing from the present data on @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite a strong flavor dependence of tmds . to extend such a study , measurements with",
    "a @xmath3 target become compelling ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , for the first data at 6 gev ) and , in the close future , highly accurate experiments are planned at 12-gev jlab @xcite .",
    "the neutron data will be extremely important to achieve the flavor separation of the tmds @xcite ; therefore to obtain a reliable information one has to take into account the nuclear structure of @xmath4 considering also the final state interaction ( fsi ) between the detected pion and the remnant debris . in the following we report our preliminary results on this issue .",
    "a polarized @xmath0he nucleus is an ideal target to study the neutron , since at a 90% level it is equivalent to a polarized neutron . for disentangling the nucleon structure from the dynamical nuclear effects",
    ", one can adopt an approach primarily based on the spin - dependent spectral function of @xmath0he , @xmath5 , ( see , e.g. @xcite ) that yields the probability distribution to find a nucleon with given missing energy ( the spectator pair is interacting ) , three - momentum and polarization inside the nucleus . by using this formalism , known as plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia )",
    ", one can safely extract @xcite the neutron longitudinal asymmetry , @xmath6 , from the corresponding @xmath0he observable , @xmath7 , obtained from the reaction @xmath8 in dis regime , i.e. ( a^exp_3 - 2 p_p f_p a^exp_p ) /(p_n",
    "f_n ) [ dis]with @xmath9 the neutron ( proton ) effective polarization inside the polarized @xmath0he , and @xmath10 , the dilution factor .",
    "realistic values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "an analogous extraction was applied to the ssa of a transversely polarized @xmath15 target , obtained from the process @xmath16 , in order to obtain the ssa of a transversely polarized neutron . in pwia and adopting the bjorken limit , the ssas of @xmath17 are a convolution of @xmath18 , and the nucleon ssas , that in turn are convolutions of suitable tmds and fragmentation functions ( ff ) , phenomenologically describing the hadronization of the hit quark .",
    "the same extraction procedure has been also applied in combination with a monte carlo simulating the kinematics of the experiment e12 - 09 - 018 @xcite .",
    "the main ingredients for the extraction were : i ) a realistic @xmath5 for the @xmath19 , obtained using the av18 interaction ; ii ) parametrizations of data for tmds and ffs , whenever available ; iii ) models for the unknown tmds and ffs . within this framework ,",
    "the extraction formula ( [ dis ] ) works well even in the case of sidis , at least at the present statistical accuracy of the existing data . indeed",
    "( [ dis ] ) has been used by the jlab hall a collaboration to extract , for the first time , the collins and sivers moments from a transversely polarized @xmath4 target @xcite .",
    "it is important to point out that the existing measurements are limited in statistical accuracy and kinematics coverage , therefore an extensive program of high precision measurements of sidis off @xmath4 will be part of the jlab program at 12 gev @xcite .",
    "the expected statistical accuracy is of the order of percent in a wide range of multi - dimensional kinematical binning ; for this reason the pwia could be no longer sufficient and the fsi , ( not considered in pwia ) may have a non - negligible role .",
    "our aim is to add this effect to the formalism , obtaining a distorted spin - dependent spectral function of the @xmath4 .",
    "l0.3     [ fig:1 ]    the jlab sidis experiments will exploit an electron beam at 8.8 and 11 gev off @xmath4 polarized gaseous target ; the relative energy between the @xmath20 system and the system of the detected pion and the remnant ( see fig . [ fig:1 ] ) is a few gev therefore the fsi can be treated within a generalized eikonal approximation framework ( gea ) .",
    "the gea was already successfully applied to unpolarized sidis @xcite , and in a recent paper the _ distorted _ spin - dependent spectral function has been calculated for the _ spectator _ sidis , where a slow @xmath20 system nucleon system , acting as a spectator of the photon - nucleon interaction , is detected , while the produced fast hadron is not @xcite . in the following we are going to report preliminary results for the usual sidis , where all the possible state of the two - nucleon spectator system have to be considered .",
    "the _ distorted _ spin - dependent spectral function for a polarized @xmath4 target can be written as s^n * s*_3_(e,*p*_mis)= = _ f_2 _  ^*_2 ( ^*_2 ) _ ^n * s*_3 f_2 (  ^*_2,*p*_mis ) ( e+ m_3-m_n - m^*_2-t_2 ) with the product of distorted overlaps defined by _",

    "the glauber operator in cartesian coordinates is given by ( * r*_1,*r*_2,*r*_3)=g(*r*,)=_i=2,3  , [ gl ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the perpendicular and the parallel components of @xmath31 with respect to the direction of the debris . the profile function ( * r*_i,*r*_i|| ) =  , [ eikonal ] unlike the standard glauber approach depends not only on the impact parameter but also on the longitudinal separation trough an effective cross section .",
    "this expression has been already used in our previous works ( for details on the model see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to recover the pwia formulation one",
    "has simply to put @xmath32 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] a preliminary plot of the @xmath4 distorted and undistorted spectral function , for the neutron , in the unpolarized case is shown .",
    "the relevant part in the extraction of the transversely polarized neutron s ssas is the transverse spectral function , given by ^n ( e,*p*_mis)=s^n 12 -12_12 -12(e,*p*_mis ) + s^n -12 12_12 -12(e,*p*_mis ) [ trspectr ]    in general @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be quite different and the effective polarizations are respectively @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath39 with and without fsi differ by 10 - 15% . nevertheless , in eq .",
    "( [ dis ] ) the effective polarizations occur in products with the dilution factor and to a large extent @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "such a fortunate case allows one to safely adopt the usual extraction , as shown by the preliminary results in fig .",
