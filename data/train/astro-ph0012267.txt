    "the formation of molecular hydrogen in the interstellar medium ( ism ) is a process of fundamental importance @xcite .",
    "it was recognized long ago @xcite that @xmath0 can not form in the gas phase efficiently enough to account for its abundance .",
    "it was thus proposed that dust grains act as catalysts , where an h atom approaching the surface of a grain has a probability @xmath1 to become adsorbed .",
    "the adsorbed h atom ( adatom ) spends an average time @xmath2 ( residence time ) before leaving the surface .",
    "if during the residence time the h adatom encounters another h adatom , an @xmath0 molecule will form with a certain probability .",
    "various aspects of this process were addressed in extensive theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "in particular , hollenbach et al . calculated the sticking and mobility of h atoms on grain surfaces .",
    "they concluded that tunneling between adsorption sites , even at temperature as low as @xmath3k , provides the required mobility .",
    "the steady state production rate of molecular hydrogen per unit volume was expressed according to @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the number density and the speed of h atoms in the gas phase , respectively , @xmath7 is the average cross - sectional area of a grain and @xmath8 is the number density of dust grains .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 is the fraction of h atoms striking the grain that eventually form a molecule , namely @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the probability that an h adatom on the surface will recombine with another h atom to form @xmath0 .",
    "recently , a series of experiments were conducted to measure hydrogen recombination in an ultra high - vacuum ( uhv ) chamber by irradiating the sample with two beams of h and d atoms and monitoring the hd production rate @xcite .",
    "two different substrates have been used : a natural olivine ( a polycrystalline silicate containing mg@xmath12sio@xmath13 and fe@xmath12sio@xmath13 ) slab and an amorphous carbon sample . the substrate temperatures during hydrogen irradiation were in the range between 5 k and 15 k. the hd formation rate was measured using a quadrupole mass spectrometer both during irradiation and in a subsequent temperature programmed desorption ( tpd ) experiment in which the sample temperature was quickly ramped to over 30 k to desorb all weakly adsorbed species .",
    "it was found that h and d atoms adsorbed on the surface at the lowest irradiation temperature of 5 k form molecules during tpd only above 9 k in the case of olivine and above 14 k in the case of amorphous carbon .",
    "this indicates that tunneling alone does not provide enough mobility to h adatoms to enable recombination , and thermal activation is required .",
    "the experimental results were analyzed using a rate equation model ( katz et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this analysis",
    "the parameters of the rate equations were fitted to the experimental tpd curves .",
    "these parameters are the activation energy barriers for atomic hydrogen diffusion and desorption , the barrier for molecular hydrogen desorption and the probability of spontaneous desorption of a hydrogen molecule upon recombination . using the values of the parameters that fit best the experimental results ,",
    "the efficiency of hydrogen recombination on the olivine and amorphous carbon surfaces was calculated for interstellar conditions using the same rate equation model .",
    "it was found that for both samples the recombination efficiency is strongly dependent on temperature and exhibits a narrow window of high recombination efficiency along the temperature axis .",
    "it was recently pointed out that since hydrogen recombination in the interstellar space takes place on small grains , rate equations have a limited range of validity @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that these equations take into account only average concentrations and ignore fluctuations as well as the discrete nature of the h atoms .",
    "these properties become significant in the limit of very small grains and low incoming flux of h atoms , exactly the conditions encountered in diffuse interstellar clouds where hydrogen recombination on silicate and carbon surfaces is expected to be relevant . as the number of h atoms on a grain fluctuates in the range of 0 , 1 or 2",
    ", the recombination rate can not be obtained from the average number alone .",
    "this can be easily understood , since the recombination process requires at least two h atoms simultaneously on the surface .",
    "comparisons with monte carlo simulations have shown that the rate equations tend to over - estimate the recombination rate .",
    "a modified set of rate equations which exhibits better agreement with monte carlo simulations was introduced by caselli et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and applied by shalabiea et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to a variety of chemical reactions . in these equations",
    "the rate coefficients are modified in a semi - empirical way to take into account the effect of the finite grain size on the recombination process .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a master equation that is particularly suitable for the simulation of chemical reactions on microscopic grains .",
    "it takes into account both the discrete nature of the h atoms as well as the fluctuations .",
    "its dynamical variables are the probabilities @xmath14 that there are @xmath15 atoms on the grain at time @xmath16 . the time derivatives @xmath17 , @xmath18 are expressed in terms of the adsorption , reaction and desorption terms .",
    "the master equation provides the time evolution of @xmath14 , @xmath18 , from which the recombination rate can be calculated .",
    "we use it in conjunction with the surface parameters obtained experimentally , to explore the hydrogen recombination process on microscopic grains for grain sizes , flux and surface temperatures pertinent to the conditions in the interstellar medium .",

    "it was found that the recombination efficiency is highly temperature dependent . for each of the two samples",
    "there is a narrow window of high efficiency along the temperature axis , which shifts to higher temperatures as the flux is increased .",
    "for the astrophysically relevant flux range the high efficiency temperature range for olivine was found to be between @xmath56k , while for amorphous carbon it is between @xmath57 k.    note that in steady state the dependence of the production rate @xmath38 on @xmath34 and @xmath58 is only through the langmuir - hinshelwood rejection term .",
    "this is easy to understand since the parameter @xmath34 only determines what fraction of the h@xmath12 will desorb upon formation and what fraction will desorb thermally at a later time .",
    "the desorption rate @xmath58 determines the coverage of h@xmath12 molecules at steady state . as long as the coverage of h and h@xmath12 is low , the langmuir - hinshelwood rejection term is small and @xmath34 and @xmath58 have little effect on the production rate @xmath38 . under interstellar conditions",
    "the coverage is expected to be low .",
    "therefore , the master equation presented below , that is required only when the number of atoms on the grain is small , does not include the rejection term .",
    "note , however , that at lower temperatures in which h atoms are immobile ( thus recombination and desorption are suppressed ) they may accumulate on the surface and reach a high coverage .",
    "we will now consider the formation of h@xmath12 molecules on small dust grains in interstellar clouds . in this case",

    "the desorption rates @xmath64 and @xmath58 remain unchanged .",
    "the hopping rate @xmath65 ( hops s@xmath28 ) is replaced by @xmath66 which is approximately the inverse of the time @xmath67 required for an atom to visit nearly all the adsorption sites on the grain surface .",

    "the h@xmath12 production rate of the single grain is given by @xmath68 ( molecules s@xmath28 ) .",
