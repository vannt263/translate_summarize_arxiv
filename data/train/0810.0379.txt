    "interestingly , the addition of non - adsorbing polymer , resulting in an effective attraction between the colloids , can enhance the relaxation process so that the system can crystallize .",
    "nevertheless , for increasing attraction strengths the particles become more and more localized due to long - lived bonds between the neighboring particles until the system is arrested in an _ attractive _ glass at smaller packing fractions  @xcite .",
    "an arrested state at low @xmath5 is often called a gel .",
    "however , the relation between gels and attractive glasses is still highly debated . in general ,",
    "gels can be classified as chemical , if the particles are linked by irreversible bonds , or as physical , if the bonds are not permanent .",
    "physical gels can form through a non - equilibrium mechanism due to the arrest of a ( metastable ) gas - liquid separation by the attractive glass transition  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", equilibrium gelation can occur in systems where the gas - liquid phase separation is suppressed by e.g. long - ranged repulsions or directional interactions  @xcite . for increasing contact energy",
    "these two mechanisms for the formation of physical gels continuously evolve towards a diffusion limited cluster aggregation ( dlca ) that leads to chemical gels .",
    "the metastable gas - liquid separation is therefore important for the formation of non - equilibrium gels  @xcite , and it is widely recognized as an important factor in protein crystallization  @xcite .",
    "there has been much recent experimental , theoretical and simulation effort in understanding the equilibrium phase diagram or the kinetics and dynamics of these systems , but only a few studies explored the relationship between the equilibrium phase diagram and the underlying kinetic pathways for gelation and crystallization .",

    "<S> first , the formation of a dense liquid is observed and second the crystal nucleates within the dense fluid . in addition , we find at low colloid packing fractions a fluid of clusters , and at higher colloid packing fractions a percolating network due to an arrested gas - liquid phase separation that we identify with gelation . we find that this arrest is due to crystallization at low interaction energy and it is caused by a slowing down of the dynamics at high interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , we observe that the clusters which are formed at low colloid packing fractions are crystalline at low interaction energy , but glassy at high interaction energy . </S>",
