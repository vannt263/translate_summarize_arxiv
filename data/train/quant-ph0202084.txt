    "according to quantum theory , the probability of the macroscopic event , which is caused by a microscopic system during an act of measurement , is of the type @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath1 is an orthogonal projection within the system s hilbert space and @xmath2 is the system s density operator at time @xmath3 .",
    "the time @xmath3 , at which the approximately instantaneous measurement interaction takes place , is determined by the experiment s design .",
    "there are , however , important situations which do not - even approximately - fit into this framework in any obvious way .",
    "consider for instance an unstable nucleus , which is monitored for several days by some initially activated detector .",
    "you patiently sit next to the detector and register the time , when you hear the click . what is the probability that you hear the click during a certain time interval ?",
    "a cleaner model situation involves a freely propagating one particle wave packet , which slowly sweeps over a detector activated at time @xmath4 .",
    "the detector is small compared to the wave packet s size .",
    "what is the probability @xmath5 of a click , happening at any time @xmath6 in the range @xmath7 ? the funcion @xmath8 is called _ arrival time distribution_. several proposals try to answer this question without reproducing the quantum zeno paradox @xcite .",
    "let us describe them briefly .",
    "for an extensive summary of the subject see @xcite .    a first approach attempts to fit @xmath5 into the scheme @xmath0 through quantising the phase space function @xmath9 , which represents the classical time of arrival .",
    "the function @xmath9 maps each phase space point from its domain onto that finite time , at which ( according to the system s classical dynamics ) this point enters the detector s location . with @xmath1 being",
    "the spectral projection of the quantised @xmath9 associated with the spectral interval @xmath10 it is assumed that @xmath11 . working out this general idea reveals that ad hoc regularisation assumptions are needed , in order to obtain a self adjoint quantisation of @xmath9 @xcite . the need for regularisation is both due to the unboundedness of @xmath9 around @xmath12 and to a classically unspecified operator ordering . due to its regularisation ambiguity",
    ", this definition of @xmath5 does not seem convincing .    a second strategy attempts to derive the arrival time distribution from a unitary quantum dynamical model of the continuing observation process and a single final measurement , i.e. the `` reading out of the observer s notices '' .",
    "to this end , an auxilliary quantum system is coupled to the particle during the time interval @xmath10 .",
    "the auxilliary system s position is taken as the pointer position of a clock and its evolution is stopped through an interaction with the particle s wave function @xcite .",
    "this approach does not yield the picture of a sudden click happening at a certain time @xmath13 , but rather of a smooth influence being exerted onto a position distribution .",
    "only the final observation at a controllable time @xmath14 then produces the stochastic position value , which is interpreted as an approximate time of arrival .",
    "therefore , our macroscopic impression that facts are permanently established in the course of time , instead of being created with a final measurement only , - `` at the end of the day '' , as sheldon goldstein has phrased it , - remains unexplained .",
    "a third way of defining @xmath8 is obtained by exposing the particle s wave function to an absorbing detector , whose influence onto the wave function is modelled by a nonhermitean hamiltonian , e.g. @xcite .",
    "thereby the one particle dynamics becomes nonunitary and the quantity @xmath15 for @xmath16 is then - up to an overall normalisation - interpreted as the probability density of clicks at time @xmath6 . however in general , though not in @xcite , @xmath17 may take negative values , which in turn implies that the probability @xmath18 ( for the detector to click sometimes between time @xmath4 and time @xmath19 ) may decrease upon increasing @xmath19 .",
    "clearly , a decreasing probability is questionable if one imagines say @xmath20 independent copies of the system side by side and the percentage of counters having made their click is monitored as a function of time .",
    "if this percentage decreases with @xmath19 , a mechanism seems to be at work , which makes clicks unhappened !",
    "finally , leavens @xcite , @xcite and mckinnon and leavens @xcite have defined an arrival time distribution @xmath8 , which is motivated by the _ bohmian flow _ connected with a solution @xmath21 of schrdinger s equation .",
    "they considered the one dimensional case and argued that the ( conditional ) probability density of clicks equals @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the spatial probability current density at the detector s location @xmath24 at time @xmath6 . in case of @xmath25 ,",
    "the conditional arrival time distribution@xmath26 is a nondecreasing ( nonnegative ) function on the interval @xmath27 . yet",
    "the integral @xmath28 need not be finite , as e.g. in the case of an harmonic oscillator dynamics , where the mapping @xmath29 is periodic . in such cases",
    "therefore , the definition ( [ stromdichtebetr ] ) does not make sense .",
    "the probability density @xmath30 is derived by leavens as the `` infinitesimal '' probability that the particle s bohmian trajectory passes the point @xmath24 during @xmath31 at time @xmath6 provided the bohmian position at time @xmath4 is distributed by @xmath32 . if one assumes that the detector clicks each time it intersects with the particle s bohmian trajectory , the density @xmath33 indeed yields the probability density of clicks .",
    "this seems to be a reasonable idealisation if the detector is active during a short time interval .",
    "what happens , however , if the detector is active over a longer period of time , such that the same trajectories pass the detector more than once ? does a detector really increase its click probability when trajectories intersect , which have done so before ?",
    "the possibility of multiple intersections between bohmian trajectories and detector positions has already been taken into account in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these works have ruled out multiple intersections for scattering situations . for a summary see also chapter 16 of drr s recent text book @xcite or @xcite . as a next step , in the context of `` near flield scattering ''",
    "the exit time statistics from a large but finite sphere around the scattering center has been investigated in @xcite . in case of multiple crossings of the sphere s surface by bohmian trajectories , replacement of @xmath34 in equation ( [ stromdichtebetr ] ) by a truncated current has been proposed in @xcite , in order to obtain the correct exit time statistics .",
    "the truncated current only counts the first exit of trajectories as detection events .",
    "this is reasonable if the initial wave packet is well localised within the sphere . yet",
    "if a considerable part of the wave packet has left the sphere by the time the detector is activated , those trajectories , which have already entered the detector and stay there , carry a nonnegligible portion of probability .",
    "accordingly they should contribute to the detector s click probability .",
    "however these trajectories do not contribute to the surface integral of the truncated current .",
    "thus under such circumstances a more general prescription is needed to count also those trajectories which are confined to the detection volume during the full period of detector activity .    in this work",
    "we propose and explore a very natural definition of detection probability within bohmian mechanics , which on the one hand meets the above needs for generalisation but also implies the idea of using the truncated current for the exit time problem described in @xcite . the physical argument behind it is quite simple : a realised trajectory induces a detection event at the earliest instance only , when this trajectory falls into the detector s volume because thereafter the detector remains discharged . according to bohmian mechanics each individual trajectory",
    "is realised with an `` infinitesimal '' probability to be computed from the wave function .",
    "adding up these infinitesimal probabilities for all the trajectories intersecting the detector s volume during its period of activity then yields this detector s click probability .",
    "assuming this , we obtain an expression for the arrival time probability density , which in general depends on the spacetime region to which the detector is sensitive . in cases , where each bohmian trajectory crosses a ( point like ) detector at most once , equation ( [ stromdichtebetr ] ) remains valid .",
    "however , our definition yields different probabilities otherwise .    why an experimental decision between the various conflicting proposals for @xmath5 is not yet feasible has been indicated in section 10 of the latest review of the subject @xcite .",
    "the basic reason seems to lie in the difficulties in preparing a specific wave packet which has to be large compared to the detector s size and which in addition has to pass the detector sufficiently slowly .",
    "clearly such experiments are not precluded on principle .",
    "after a brief summary of bohmian mechanics in section 2 , we develop our definition of the arrival time distribution @xmath5 in sections 3 , 4 , and 5 within a galilean spacetime frame work .",
    "using spacetime proves very suggestive since bohmian trajectories become one dimensional submanifolds ( worldlines ) instead of mappings . in section 3",
    "we define the galilean ( one particle ) spacetime from its structural atlas .",
    "section 4 contains an outline of conserved flows on galilean spacetime . here",
    "again we choose the coordinate independent formalism of exterior calculus .",
    "this has the following advantage .",
    "when computing the flux through a ( possibly moving ) hypersurface it is the current 3-form which is integrated over a 3-manifold .",
    "neither a metric spacetime structure nor a normal vector field , both breaking galilean invariance , need to be introduced .",
    "the main result of this section is the formula of definition 4 which gives the amount of conserved  mass  passing through a spacetime region @xmath35 . in section 5",
    "we apply this formula to the flow of the quantum mechanical position probability . here",
    "our definition of the detection probability is obtained from the quantum mechanical probability measure on the set of bohmian worldlines ( orbit space ) , which follows from the wave function @xmath36 under consideration .",
    "the probability that a detector clicks , is assumed to equal the probability measure of the set @xmath37 of all those orbits , that have a nonempty intersection with the spacetime region @xmath35 , to which the detector is sensitive .",
    "this measure in turn equals the usual quantum mechanical probability measure to detect a particle with wave function @xmath36 at @xmath38 within the set of all those locations which are taken by the orbits of @xmath37 at @xmath38 .",
    "our definition works for very general , extended spacetime regions and it works for the free schrdinger dynamics as well as for ones with nonzero potential .",
    "the coordinate independent treatment guarantees galilean invariance of the detection probability for zero potential . in section 6",
    "we illustrate our notion of @xmath5 through the example of a free standing gaussian wave packet .",
    "our definition of @xmath5 in terms of the bohmian flow could be improved by taking into account the detector s influence onto the particle s bohmian trajectories .",
    "since the latter become projections of the higher dimensional orbits of the detector plus particle system , this effect can be considerable even for detectors without any back reaction onto the particle wave function @xcite .",
    "the general idea of our approach however , remains the same .",
    "also if the detector ( or even the observer ) is modeled as part of the quantum system , an assumption has to be made about when each individual orbit generates the click ( in the observer s mind ) .",
    "this rule then mathematically represents the discrete event , which is missing from standard quantum theory .",
    "the density operator @xmath39 , representing the state of a quantum system with ( separable ) hilbert space @xmath40 , defines a probability measure @xmath41 on the spectrum of any self adjoint operator @xmath9 of @xmath40 .",
    "it is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the spectral projection of @xmath9 associated with the borel set @xmath44 .",
    "standard quantum theory assumes that , if a measurement of the observable @xmath9 is performed on the state @xmath39 , then @xmath45 equals the probability of the event  the measured spectral value @xmath46 of @xmath9 belongs to @xmath47  .",
    "now , for @xmath48 , there does not exist a density operator @xmath39 such that @xmath41 is dispersion free , i.e. a point measure , for all @xmath9 .",
    "gleason @xcite has investigated the question whether there exist more general ways of defining a probability measure on @xmath49 for all @xmath9 . to this end",
    "he considered the mappings @xmath50 from the set @xmath51 of all orthogonal projections of @xmath40 into the real numbers such that @xmath52 for all @xmath53 and @xmath54 for any countable sum of @xmath55 , with @xmath56 .",
    "in addition he assumed @xmath57 . from this he derived in case of @xmath58 that for any such mapping @xmath59   $ ] there exists a density operator @xmath39 such that @xmath60 for all @xmath53 .",
    "thus the idea of generalising the formula @xmath61 to @xmath62 in order to possibly obtain  deterministic states ",
    ", i.e. point measures @xmath63 for all @xmath9 , and a representation of density operators as mixtures of these , under the adopted assumptions fails .",
    "the standard quantum physical interpretation of this body of mathematical facts leads to the following conclusion .",
    "it is inconsistent to suppose that the state of an individual quantum system is a deterministic state , i.e.  determines values for all observables , and it is inconsistent to suppose that a density operator @xmath39 only describes a mixture of such fictitious deterministic states .",
    "( it is generally held inconsistent to suppose that an idividual particle has a specific position and a specific momentum and so on . )    from this conclusion then the notorious _ quantum measurement problem _ follows : how can standard quantum theory represent within its formalism the mere fact that individual closed systems do have properties ?",
    "( this surely is the case for systems comprising an observer and not beeing in need of any sort of external observation inducing a state reduction , the quantised deus ex machina . ) which fact concerning a closed system is it , whose probability of being the case is given by @xmath45 ?",
    "bohmian mechanics resolves these problems for systems with a schrdinger ( or dirac ) equation : a picture of individual systems with defined properties emerges .",
    "a concise review of bohmian mechanics is given in reference @xcite .",
    "an informal but clear summary is to be found in goldstein s contribution to the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy @xcite .",
    "let us summarise the basic ideas .",
    "bohmian mechanics introduces deterministic states which violate gleason s assumptions and accordingly circumvent his theorem .",
    "it is assumed that an individual system has a state @xmath64 given by a wave function @xmath36 in the system s hilbert space and a point @xmath65 in its configuration space .",
    "@xmath65 is supposed to represent the actual positions of the system s constituents .",
    "other observable properties of the system have to be derived from the bohmian state through a dynamical analysis of the concrete experiment designed to measure them . in this way",
    "all other properties like spin or momentum are expressed through the state s well defined position properties .",
    "it turns out , that the spectral value , which a general observable assumes in a bohmian state , depends on the specific way of how this observable is measured , i.e. contextuality is found to be realised @xcite . accordingly",
    "gleason s assumptions on the mapping @xmath50 are violated because @xmath50 needs a much more complex domain than simply the set of all orthogonal projections .    in order to work out the dynamical program of reducing all state properties to position properties , the time evolution of bohmian states is needed .",
    "it is assumed to be given by a schrdinger equation for the wave function and by a time dependent tangent vector field @xmath66 on the configuration space .",
    "@xmath66 is defined in terms of the solution @xmath21 of the adopted schrdinger equation with initial condition @xmath67 .",
    "the integral curve @xmath68 of @xmath66 with initial condition @xmath69 gives the system s configuration at time @xmath6 by @xmath70 .",
    "finally , bohmian mechanics establishes contact with empirical data .",
    "this happens according to the rule of quantum equilibrium .",
    "it states that for an ensemble of systems , each with wave function @xmath36 , the individual system s position @xmath65 belongs to a configuration space domain @xmath71 with the usual probability @xmath72 .",
    "a controlled preparation of @xmath65 contradicting this rule is assumed to be impossible by present day technology .",
    "( all this can be justified to a certain extent within the bohmian picture @xcite . ) and finally as a last ingredient it is supposed that it is the center of mass position of pointers and the like that we observe .",
    "the rules of bohmian mechanics are such that the probabilistic statements of standard quantum theory are reproduced .",
    "so there seems no room left to argue about the empirical superiority of either standard quantum mechanics or its bohmian extension at the ensemble level .",
    "bohmian mechanics might , however , give a clue for the correct treatment of ensemble problems , where the standard interpretation remains unclear and offers conflicting strategies .",
    "as described above , standard quantum theory offers various different conceptions for the arrival time distribution @xmath5 .",
    "therefore we hold the arrival time problem to be one such opportunity for bohmian mechanics to possibly show that it also has its value in dealing with ensemble problems on top of its merit of providing a language for speaking about individual systems .",
    "we add another conception for @xmath5 which is motivated by the bohmian extension of quantum mechanics .",
    "it does not conform to the standard scheme of identifying @xmath5 with some quantity of the type @xmath73 with @xmath1 being independent from @xmath39 .",
    "our @xmath5 needs the concept of bohmian trajectories for its very formulation .",
    "one should note , however , that bohmian trajectories are implicit in the wave function , whether one intends to make use of them or not .",
    "we model spacetime as a _",
    "galilean manifold_. various equivalent definitions of a galilean manifold can be given .",
