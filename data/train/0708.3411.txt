    "uncovering non - deterministic causal relations between observed quantities relies on the evaluation of statistical dependences and correlations in empirical data .",
    "two types of statistical data have to be carefully distinguished : in so - called _ experimental _ data , one observes the change of the distribution of one variable after interventions that control the value of the other .",
    "more often , one has to evaluate _ non - experimental _ data where no controlling intervention by the researcher is possible and he tries to draw causal conclusions merely from observed dependences in the statistics .",
    "causal reasoning that relies on non - experimental data is likely to lead to serious misconclusions .",
    "the main obstacle is that statistical dependences between two random variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be due to three types of ( non - exclusive ) causal relations .",
    "first , @xmath0 may be a cause of @xmath1 , second , @xmath1 may be a cause of @xmath0 , or third , there may be a ( latent ) common cause , i.e. , a hidden variable @xmath2 effecting @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is usually referred to as the `` principle of the common cause '' @xcite .    if the variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 are time - ordered and @xmath0 refers to observations that precedes the observation of @xmath1 it is still hard to decide whether @xmath0 effects @xmath1 or there is a hidden common cause ( `` confounder '' ) @xmath2 .",
    "however , it is known that the joint distribution of at least 3 variables provides some hints on causal directions @xcite via _ conditional _ independences among variables . for instance , if the stochastic dependence between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is only generated by some common cause @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fc ] , left ) ,    the variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 must be independent with respect to the conditional probability given @xmath2",
    ". on the other hand , if @xmath2 is a common effect of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fc ] , right ) , the role of _ unconditional _ probabilities and _ conditional _ probabilities is reversed : the conditional probability given @xmath2 would then , in the generic case , generate dependences between the ( actually independent ) variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "common effects can not be accepted as an explanation for ( unconditional ) dependences but common causes can . already reichenbach @xcite argued that this statistical asymmetry with respect to reversing causal arrows is linked to the thermodynamic arrow of time .",
    "before we describe another asymmetry between cause and effect that we @xcite have observed to be useful in causal reasoning and discuss its relation to statistical physics we first sketch the known approaches to causal inference from empirical data .",
    "following @xcite we restrict our attention to causal structures without feedback loops and describe a causal structure as a directed acyclic graph ( dag ) with random variables @xmath3 as nodes .",
    "an arrow from @xmath4 to @xmath5 indicates that @xmath4 directly influences @xmath5 .",
    "even though a definition of cause and effect would require deep philosophical discussions @xcite , we will define causal relations by referring to _ hypothetical _ interventions .",
    "the variable @xmath0 influences @xmath1 whenever adjusting @xmath0 ( by external control ) to some different value @xmath6 changes the distribution of @xmath1 ( throughout the paper , we will capitalize random variables and denote their values by lowercase letters ) .",
    "the influence from @xmath4 on @xmath5 is _ direct _ ( relative to the set @xmath3 ) whenever the change of the distribution of @xmath5 caused by different adjustments of @xmath4 occurs also when all the other variables are fixed by an additional intervention .",
    "this definition makes clear that causal inference from non - experimental data infers probability distributions of _ hypothetical experimental data_. the connection between the statistics of non - experimental observations and the causal graph ( encoding information about the effect of hypothetical interventions ) is provided by the causal markov condition .    @xmath7 + [ mkc ] let @xmath8 be a dag with @xmath9 random variables @xmath3 as nodes .",
    "a joint distribution @xmath10 on these variables satisfies the ( local ) markov condition with respect to @xmath8 if each variable is , given its parents , is conditionally independent of its non - descendants .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume that @xmath11 has a probability density @xmath12 with respect to some product distribution ( note that this assumption does not exclude discrete variables since probability mass functions of discrete distributions are also densities ) .",
    "then @xmath12 can be factorized into conditional probabilities for each variable , given its parents @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a short notation for the subset of values @xmath15",
    "that correspond to the parents @xmath16 of @xmath5 with respectto @xmath8 .",
    "the conditional densities @xmath17 will be called the `` markov kernels '' corresponding to the causal hypothesis @xmath8 .",
    "conversely , every choice of markov kernels @xmath17 leads to a markovian distribution .",
    "following @xcite we accept a causal hypothesis only if the observed statistical dependences are consistent with the markov condition and mention also that this can be justified by so - called _ functional models _ :    @xmath7 + [ functional ] for each node @xmath5 we introduce an additional noise variable @xmath18 and assume that the actual value @xmath19 of @xmath5 is a deterministic function of @xmath18 and all parents of @xmath5",
    ". all the @xmath18 are jointly statistically independent .",
    "then the markov condition follows due to theorem  1.4.1 in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that noise variable @xmath18 is , by construction , statistically independent of the ancestors of @xmath5 , but in the generic case there are dependences to the descendants of @xmath5 .",
    "the relation of this asymmetry between cause and effect to the second law of thermodynamics will be discussed in section  [ sec : commonroot ] .    there are at least @xmath20 causal graphs for which all distributions @xmath10 are markovian , namely every _",
    "complete _ dag ( that is , a graph where each @xmath4 has an arrow to @xmath5 for every @xmath21 if some arbitrary order of nodes is given ) .",
    "one therefore needs additional inference rules .",
    "so - called independence - based approaches to causal inference @xcite are based upon the so - called faithfulness assumption :    @xmath7 + a joint probability distribution @xmath10 on @xmath9 random variables @xmath3 is faithful with respect to @xmath8 if only those conditional independences are true which are implied by the markov condition .",
    "the idea is the following : given @xmath8 and an independent choice of values for the free parameters @xmath17 it is unlikely to obtain a non - faithful graph .",
    "it is more natural to assume that an independence relation holds because it is entailed by the causal structure than that it is due to _ specific adjustments _ of the parameters @xmath17 . arguments of this kind are justified by referring to `` occam s razor '' @xcite .",
    "also bayesian methods to causal discovery @xcite are known to give an implicit preference to faithful structures provided that the priors are positive densities on the space of all @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , faithfulness leads rarely to a unique causal graph .",
    "more often there are still several possible causal hypotheses . therefore , additional inference rules are desirable . in seeking new methods",
    "one must be aware of the fact that no inference principle can always lead to correct results since there is in principle no method to infer causal relations from non - experimental data that is always reliable .",
    "this is because one can construct a technical system with causal structure @xmath8 that generates any desired joint distribution @xmath10 that factorizes according to eq .",
    "( [ markovfac ] ) . to this end , let each node @xmath22 be a random generator whose inputs are provided by the parents of @xmath22 and whose output is sampled according to @xmath17 . then the joint output @xmath15 is obviously sampled from @xmath12 .",
    "recent proposals for alternative causal inference methods are based on the observation that in many cases @xmath17 are quite complex functions for one causal directions and simple for others @xcite .",
    "then the idea is that the causal hypotheses for which the markov kernels are simpler are more likely to be the true ones .",
    "we have proposed @xcite to use this approach for post - selection of causal hypotheses after independence - based algorithms have already reduced the set of potential causal graphs . however , the case of two variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 where the task is to distinguish between @xmath23 and @xmath24 is particularly interesting because independence - based approaches fail completely",
    ". we will therefore devote our main attention to this case .",
    "the idea that models in forward ( time and causal ) direction tend to be simpler than in backward direction , is certainly not new .",
    "the underlying intuition has influenced human and automated reasoning since a long time .",
    "psychological studies indicate that human intuition is better in estimating the strength of causal links ( which is encoded in causal conditionals @xmath25 ) than in inferring non - causal conditionals @xcite .",
    "for this reason , it is straightforward that simplicity principles ( `` occam s razor '' ) are automatically interpreted as simplicity of a model when described in the correct causal direction .",
    "however , the author is not aware of any systematic exploration of the theoretical background of causally asymmetric interpretations of occam s razor from a statistical physics point of view .",
    "the main ideas of this paper can be summarized as follows :",
    "\\(1 ) the paper describes various simple models from quantum and classical physics where the factorization of the joint distribution @xmath26 into @xmath27 yields `` simpler '' terms than the `` non - causal '' factorization into @xmath28 .",
    "we will discuss different notions of simplicity for which this is likely to be the case .",
    "\\(2 ) for these models , we describe why the simplicity of causal and forward - time conditionals is because ( a ) the dynamical laws of motion and the hamiltonians are simple , and ( b ) the relevant systems start in statistically independent states rather than ending up in independent states .",
    "this point of view shows a link between the suggested asymmetry between cause and effect and the arrow of time in thermodynamically irreversible processes .",
    "while interactions between physical systems @xmath29 and @xmath30 typically lead to mutual influence , we can nevertheless obtain well - defined causal directions :    first , the variable @xmath0 will refer to the state of @xmath29 at some time @xmath31 and @xmath1 to the state of @xmath30 at some later time @xmath32 or @xmath0 and @xmath1 refer to different time instants of the same system .",
    "the second approach is to turn the interaction between @xmath29 and @xmath30 on only after the state of @xmath29 is adjusted to its present state in order to avoid backaction from @xmath30 to @xmath29 .",
    "the third approach is to choose physical conditions such that the influence of @xmath30 on @xmath29 is negligible .",
    "we will , for instance , discuss non - equilibrium steady states with temperature gradient where this is the case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ plmk ]",
    "we sketch the inference rule proposed in @xcite and our approach to define smoothness of probability distributions by constrained maximization of conditional entropy .",
    "section  [ qmodels ] describes physical experiments that are consistent with our inference rule .",
    "we discuss how the examples had to be modified if one tries to obtain simple markov kernels for the _ non - causal _",
    "conditionals @xmath33 . in section  [ sec : aspects ] we discuss examples showing that causal conditionals are also simpler than non - causal ones with respect to other notions of simplicity , for instance , with respect to computational complexity . we consider the computational complexity of conditional probabilities connecting input and output of a boolean circuit with additional noise and argue that @xmath34 can efficiently be computed but @xmath33 can not , provided that the inputs are independent .",
    "we describe how this asymmetry is linked to the thermodynamics of computation .",
    "section  [ sec : commonroot ] connects the asymmetry between cause and effect in the shapes of conditionals to the asymmetry stated by the causal markov condition .",
    "section  [ noneq ] describes results that link the observed asymmetries to the thermodynamics of non - equilibrium steady states .",
    "to explain our inference principle we consider _ complete _ dags .",
    "they are given by an arbitrary ordering of the @xmath9 variables and drawing an arrow from each variable to every other that appears later in the order .",
    "then the causal hypotheses are uniquely characterized by one out of @xmath20 possible orderings of the nodes ( `` causal ordering '' ) .",
    "this is no loss of generality since the true graph can be obtained by removing statistically irrelevant parents , given that it is a subgraph of the hypothetical complete graph .",
    "the _ markov kernels _ corresponding to a hypothetical causal order @xmath3 are defined as the conditional probabilities @xmath35 .",
    "the venue of our discussion will be the following vague formulation of our inference rule .    @xmath7 + [ pplmk ] prefer the hypothetical causal order @xmath3 for which the corresponding markov kernels @xmath36 are as simple and smooth as possible .",
    "how to define smoothness and simplicity in a reasonable way is , however , a difficult problem . as a first attempt , which provided some encouraging results ,",
    "we have chosen the following definition @xcite .    @xmath7 + [ sc ] the simplest non - trivial conditionals @xmath36 are those that maximize the conditional shannon entropy of @xmath5 given @xmath37 subject to the given expectations @xmath38 and second moments @xmath39 for @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the ensemble averages of the corresponding quantities .",
    "the conditional shannon entropy of @xmath5 given @xmath37 is defined by @xmath43 , where the integral has to be read as a sum for the case of discrete variables .    to include vector - valued variables @xmath5 with components @xmath44 with @xmath45 , one maximizes entropy subject to the constraints",
    "are given by @xmath46 for @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "the term `` second order markov kernel '' is justified by the following known fact :    @xmath7 + the conditionals given by definition  [ pplmk ] read @xmath49 with appropriate constants @xmath50 and the partition function @xmath51 .    _ proof : _ we describe the proof for the continuous case , because the discrete one is even more straightforward .",
    "let us first assume that the value set of @xmath5 is restricted to a the interval @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "then we can define a uniform distribution @xmath53 with density @xmath54 .",
    "maximizing shannon entropy is then equivalent to minimizing the kullback - leibler distance @xmath55 subject to the same constraints . using theorem  2.2 in @xcite",
    ", the solution is given eq .",
    "( [ expl ] ) . with @xmath56",
    "we obtain the same solution without restricting @xmath5 to a compact interval . @xmath57 .    up to the partition function , the conditionals in eq .",
    "( [ expl ] ) are given by second order polynomials .",
    "since first order polynomials can not describe statistical dependences between variables , we have indeed the simplest non - trivial class of conditionals in the hierarchy @xcite when we define models of @xmath58th order as those containing polynomials up to degree @xmath58 .",
    "our inference rule reads :    @xmath7 + [ soexpl ] estimate the first and second moments @xmath59 and @xmath60 from the data set using the ensemble averages . for",
    "all hypothetical causal orders @xmath3 compute the second order markov kernels @xmath61 in the sense of definition  [ sc ] by maximizing conditional entropies subject to these moments .",
    "decide by appropriate statistical tests for which ordering the obtained joint density @xmath12 provides the best fit to the observed data .",
    "this approach should only be considered as a preliminary attempt to formalize simplicity . instead of only describing _ the simplest _ conditionals as above we have also proposed @xcite a method to quantify the complexity of conditional densities .",
    "then causal inference is done by preferring the direction that minimizes the sum of the complexities of all markov kernels .",
    "however , we will focus on the first approach .",
    "we describe two instances where our principle is very intuitive .",
    "first we consider two random variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 where @xmath0 is binary , i.e. , its value set is @xmath62 and the value set of @xmath1 is @xmath63 .",
    "assume that @xmath0 influences @xmath1 .",
    "the best second order model for @xmath64 is just the distribution given by the observed relative frequencies . using eq .",
    "( [ expl ] ) we obtain @xmath65 with appropriate @xmath66 . for every @xmath6",
    ", @xmath67 is a gaussian distribution where @xmath6 determines the means @xcite . indeed , after having observed that the marginal distribution of @xmath1 is a mixture of two gaussians and that the conditionals @xmath68 are simple gaussians it seems very plausible to assume that @xmath0 effects @xmath1 and not vice versa .",
    "now we consider the reverse situation where @xmath1 influences @xmath0 .",
    "the second order model for @xmath69 generates the gaussian distribution . for @xmath70",
    "we obtain @xcite @xmath71 with appropriate @xmath72 . for this example , one checks easily that only the trivial case @xmath73 can have a second order model in both directions .    in section  [ qmodels ] we will analyze examples from physics with one binary and one continuous variable that are consistent with the above second order markov kernels .",
    "we have decided to choose examples from quantum mechanics for two reasons .",
    "first , the quantum world provides us with natural realizations of binary variables .",
    "second , the simplicity of the models under consideration is intriguing .",
    "nevertheless , quantum _ superpositions _ are not relevant for the arguments in the next subsections .",
    "consider first an experiment like the one designed by stern and gerlach in 1922 @xcite to prove the quantization of the magnetic moment .",
    "a beam of atoms is emitted from a furnace and enters an inhomogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to the beam ( see fig .",
    "[ sterngerlachfig ] , here the field is in vertical direction ) ,    [ sterngerlachfig ]    the field induces a force in the direction of its gradient which is proportional to the magnetic moment of the particles . for spin-1/2 particles , for instance",
    ", the magnetic moment can attain the values @xmath74 causing forces in opposite vertical directions .",
    "this effect can be used as a measurement apparatus for the quantum observable _ magnetic moment _ since it separates the beam into two parts that hit the screen at different vertical positions .",
    "we consider the values @xmath75 as the two values of a binary variable @xmath0 . even though quantum mechanical observables are in general not random variables on a probability space , this is well - justified because the quantum superposition already becomes incoherent ( by creating entanglement with the position degree of freedom ) when the beam _ begins _ to split up .",
    "we define furthermore a random variable @xmath1 for the vertical coordinate of the point where the atom hits the screen .",
    "it is natural to assume that the conditional probabilities @xmath76 are both not too different from normal distributions .",
    "the following extremely simplified model , for instance , yields gaussian conditionals .",
    "before the particles have left the source they are subjected to some focusing forces . for simplicity",
    "we restrict our attention to the focus in vertical direction and assume that the forces are induced by a harmonic potential in vertical direction . in thermal equilibrium , the probability distribution of momenta in a classical as well as in a quantum harmonic oscillator is gaussian ( see section  [ thermo ] and @xcite , respectively ) . assuming that the probability distribution of the particle momenta is still gaussian when they leave the source we obtain for both spin values gauss distributions for @xmath1 with different expected values .    even though the terms _ cause _ and _ effect _ are even more philosophically problematic when quantum effects come into play , we claim that @xmath0 influences @xmath1 : if we subject a spin measurement to the particles before the beam passes the inhomogeneous field and remove all atoms with spin down , for instance , we get only one branch of the beam . given the simplified assumptions above , the markov kernel @xmath67 coincides with the second order kernel in eq .",
    "( [ gausspl ] ) .",
    "assume now , we had observed a gaussian _ marginal _ distribution for @xmath1 instead of gaussian _ conditionals _ and a conditional @xmath70 as in eq .",
    "( [ tanh ] ) .",
    "our inference rule would then assume that @xmath1 is the cause .",
    "for this reason we want to check whether there are modifications of the stern - gerlach experiment which keep the causal direction but generate such a distribution .",
    "we could , for instance , assume that the transversal potential in the furnace is strongly anharmonic such that the particle momenta @xmath2 are distributed according to some probability density @xmath77 after the particles have left the source .",
    "due to the laws of motion , we assume that @xmath78 is a linear function in @xmath79 for both spin values : @xmath80 here @xmath81 denotes the shift of the expected values caused by the magnetic moments of particles with spin @xmath82 and @xmath83 is some constant . in order to obtain gaussian marginals for @xmath1 , @xmath77 must be such that the convex sum of @xmath77 and its shifted copy is gaussian .",
    "to see that this is impossible we recall that the gaussian measure could then be written as a convolution of @xmath77 with a measure @xmath84 that is supported by two points .",
    "hence the fourier transform of @xmath84 multiplied with the fourier transform of @xmath77 would be the fourier transform of a gaussian which is again a gaussian ( up to a phase function ) .",
    "but this is in contradiction to the fact that the fourier transform of @xmath84 has zeros .",
    "this shows that gaussian marginals for @xmath1 can not be obtained by choosing a `` contrived '' potential only .",
    "we would also have to modify the laws of motion given by the magnetic field .",
    "one could , for instance , have a field with strongly inhomogeneous field gradient such that atoms with different transversal momenta enter locations with different field gradient .",
    "[ sgg ] shows a simplified graphical model of the causal structure : the position @xmath1 is here assumed to be a deterministic function @xmath85 of the binary variable spin @xmath0 and a `` noise '' variable @xmath2 , the initial momentum .",
    "smoothness of the conditional @xmath67 is here due to the smoothness of @xmath86 and the smoothness of the distribution of momenta .",
    "last but not least , we should stress the decisive assumption that spin and _ initial _ momenta are statistically independent .",
    "now we present an example where a continuous classical variable @xmath1 influences a discrete variable @xmath0 . given a spin-1/2 particle subjected to a field in z - direction whose ( randomly fluctuating ) strength is represented by the random variable @xmath1 .",

    "this is because the density operator of a quantum system with hamiltonian @xmath90 and temperature @xmath91 is given by @xmath92 where @xmath79 is the appropriate normalization factor .",

    ", we try to modify the setup ( for spin 1/2 ) such that the same causal mechanism leads to a second order model in the _ opposite _ causal direction .",

    "in contrast to the modifications in the stern - gerlach experiment that were required to `` outsmart our principle '' the causal mechanism as such has not to be modified here . there is nevertheless a constraint that makes the described situation unlikely to occur unless the setup was designed _ by hand _ : the fact that the temperature value has to be adjusted to _ one specific _ value that is derived from @xmath101 ( even though there is no physical reason that makes this coincidence likely ) shows that the counterexample is _ non - generic _ and @xmath34 share algorithmic information which suggests to prefer the opposite causal direction . ] .    here , the reason why thermodynamics predicts a smooth conditional probability for the effect given the cause is , abstractly speaking , the following .",
    "the equilibrium states maximize entropy subject to the energy . here",
    "the energy depends smoothly ( just linearly ) on the cause ( i.e. the field strength ) .",
    "hence the smoothness of the conditionals is due to the smoothness of the physical hamiltonian .",
