    "most of these results are also exposed in the survey paper @xcite from which we borrow some terminology not used in the original work of viro s school .",
    "a _ spindle _ ( or _ isotopy join _ or _ horizontal configuration _ ) is a particularly nice configuration of skew lines in which all lines intersect an oriented additional line @xmath2 , called the _ axis _ of the spindle .",

    "three types of combinatorial moves ( described in section [ spindles ] ) of a spindle permutation yield isotopic spindles - configurations and generate an equivalence relation , called the _ spindle - equivalence _ relation , on permutations of @xmath4 .",
    "isotopy classes of spindle - configurations are well understood by the following combinatorial description , given in @xcite :    [ main ] two spindle - permutations @xmath5 give rise to isotopic spindle - configurations if and only if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are spindle - equivalent .",
    "orienting and labeling all lines of a skew configuration , one gets a _ linking matrix _ encoding isotopy classes for pairs of oriented skew lines . the associated _ switching class _ or _ homology equivalence class _ is independent of labels and orientations .",
    "a result of khashin and mazurovski ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2 ) states that homology - equivalent spindles ( spindles defining the same switching class ) are isotopic .",
    "thus we have :    [ maincor ] two spindle - permutations define the same switching class if and only if they are spindle - equivalent .    in this paper",
    "we define the euler partition for a switching class .",
    "the definition depends on the parity of the order and can be refined to an euler tree for switching classes of even order .",

    "<S> in this paper , which is a complement of @xcite , we study a few elementary invariants for configurations of skew lines , as introduced and analyzed first by viro and his collaborators . </S>",
    "<S> we slightly simplify the exposition of some known invariants and use them to define a natural partition of the lines in a skew configuration .    </S>",
    "<S> we also describe an algorithm which constructs a spindle - permutation for a given switching class , or proves non - existence of such a spindle - permutation . </S>"
