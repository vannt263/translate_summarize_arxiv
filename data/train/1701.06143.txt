    "there are many observational evidences in black hole ( bh ) x - ray binaries ( bhbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) for the coupling between the collimated relativistic jet and the accretion flow .",
    "one such evidence comes from @xcite and @xcite , who discovered a remarkably tight correlation between radio ( monochromatic , @xmath15 at , e.g. 5 or 8.5 ghz ) and x - ray ( at 210 kev ; hereafter @xmath16 ) luminosities in bhbs during their hard states ( see @xcite for latest summary ) .",
    "this correlation was later extended to include low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) . with the impact of black hole mass @xmath17 taken into account , (",
    "* hereafter m03 ) found that , @xmath18 , with a scatter of @xmath19 dex . here",
    "( and throughout this paper ) the luminosities and bh mass are , respectively , in units of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we refer this relationship as the _ original / standard _ m03 `` fundamental plane '' ( hereafter fp ) of back hole activity ( for later work , see e.g. , @xcite , hereafter g09 ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have proposed a coupled accretion  jet model for llagns and bhbs ( see @xcite for a review ) . in this model , unless the system is extremely faint , the thermal gas in a hot accretion flow is responsible for the x - ray emission and the relativistic power - law distribution electrons in a jet produce the radio emission .",
    "* hereafter yc05 ) show that the fp can be explained naturally in this model ( seel also m03 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , i.e. it is a direct consequence of a tight relationship between mass inflow / accretion rate and mass ejection rate ( yc05 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the scatter of the correlation , on the other hand , may reflects the ( combination of ) effects of other parameters , e.g. , the intrinsic variability in radio and x - rays , the bh spin @xcite , the strength of magnetic field @xcite , the doppler beaming effect ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) , the angular momentum of the accreting gas @xcite and the environment @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of the original m03 fp , several notable complexities are revealed over the past decade .",
    "first , agns with different radio loudness seem to follow relationships that are different in both normalization and correlation slope ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , long - term quasi - simultaneous monitoring on individual sources find that , some sources do not follow the slope predicted by the original m03 fp during their fluctuations in luminosities , and they can be classified as outliers ( for bhbs , see e.g. @xcite , and @xcite for a recent summary ; for agns , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these outliers , _ individually _ , seem to follow a hybrid radio / x - ray correlation , i.e. @xmath22 when @xmath16 is high ( see also @xcite ) , @xmath23 when @xmath16 is moderately low , and can recover the original m03 fp when @xmath16 is much lower .",
    "the hybrid correlation is most evident in bhb h1743322 @xcite and llagn ngc 7213 @xcite .",
    "the third complexity , which is the focus of this work , is whether or not the agns with extremely low luminosities , i.e. the so - called `` quiescent '' agns ( defined as sources with @xmath8 , here @xmath24 is the eddington luminosity ) , follow the original m03 fp .",
    "yc05 shows that the answer should be `` no '' .",
    "the reason is that in the accretion ",
    "jet scenario , the origin of the x - ray emission in quiescent agns is different to that of normal llagns ( defined as sources with @xmath11 ) , i.e. it originates from jet instead of hot accretion flow ( yc05 ) .",
    "physically , this is because the both the hot accretion flow and the jet emit x - ray emission , but the dependence of x - ray radiation from the hot accretion flow on the accretion rate is less sensitive compared to that from the jet .",
    "thus with the decrease of accretion rate ( or equivalently luminosity ) , the radiation from the jet will catch up with that from the accretion flow and become dominant below a critical luminosity @xmath25 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , because of the change of the x - ray origin from a hot accretion flow to a jet , yc05 predicts that the quiescent accretion systems will follow a steeper relationship between radio and x - rays ( see also @xcite ) , i.e. , the fp of faint accretion systems is revised to ( yyh09 ) , @xmath26 .",
    "hereafter we will refer to this relationship as the yc05 fp .",
    "we note that the value of the critical luminosity @xmath27 depends on detailed parameters that control the properties of accretion flow and/or jet .",
    "the @xmath27 value obtained in yc05 is for the `` general '' sources .",
    "if for some reason ( e.g. , doppler beaming ) the radiation from the jet is very strong in some sources , the critical luminosity can become significantly larger .",
    "this is the case of radio loud sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this work",
    ", we aim at `` general '' sources .",
    "the yc05 predictions have been confirmed by many observational and theoretical works ( see review by yuan & narayan 2014 ) , both of agns ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter yyh09 ; @xcite ) and bhbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , yyh09 did a statistical analysis based on a sample consisting of 22 quiescent agns .",
    "they found @xmath28 , in excellent agreement with yc05 prediction .",
    "however , there are also claims in literature on an universal fp extending down to quiescent systems , without any steepening pattern . for example",
    ", the three bhbs with radio and x - ray observations during their quiescent states are claimed to follow the original m03 fp at low x - ray luminosities @xcite . for agns , recently ( * ? ? ? * hereafter dw15 ) selected from the flux - limited polmar survey a sample of 73 agns ( sgr a * also included ) , and combine with a large sample of data points of bhbs , to investigate the fp _",
    "jointly _ from sub - eddington to quiescent systems .",
    "they claim that those with @xmath29 ( 24 agns under a detailed definition of @xmath27 , cf .",
    "dw15 ) seem to be roughly consistent the original m03 fp .",
    "as discussed in detail later in sections  [ sec : otherworks ] & [ sec : jointfit ] , we argue their analysis and conclusion have some problems .    in this work ,",
    "the fp of quiescent systems is re - examined .",
    "because the aim is to check the yc05 prediction , following yyh09 , we exclude normal llagns and focus on quiescent agns only . in order to reduce the contamination of the host galaxy ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to observations that have sufficiently high spatial resolution and sensitivity .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "we describe our sample compilation ( 75 sources in total , to our knowledge the largest quiescent agn sample to date ) in section  [ sec : sample ] .",
    "we then introduce the statistical analysis method in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "subsequently we present the fitting results in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "sections  [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : summary ] are devoted to discussions and a brief summary respectively .",
    "we gather from literature a sample of quiescent / faint agns with measurements in their black hole mass , nuclei radio ( at 5 ghz ) and x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) luminosities . since most of our targets are weak nuclei at the center of normal galaxies , contamination of emission from their host galaxy , i.e. the radio emission due to residual star formation or supernovae remnants in the nuclei region of the host galaxy , or extended / elongated radio emission from mini - lobes if the jet is spatially resolved ( cf .",
    "discussions in @xcite ) , could be of vital importance . in order to discriminate these possible contaminations",
    ", we select data which are observed with arcsec ( or even higher , e.g. , _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  for x - rays , and very large array [ vla ] for radio . ) spatial resolution . for sources that have several observations , we prefer data with higher spatial resolution . moreover ,",
    "for sources with extended radio morphologies , we only consider the nuclei component , i.e. the emission of the compact jet . considering the strong fluctuations in agn activity",
    ", we argue that only this compact radio component relates directly to the _ current _ nuclei activity ( shown in x - rays ) of the agns .",
    "we also note that for the x - rays of ngc  3115 , only the compact component is adopted @xcite .    the bh mass in these systems is mostly derived based on the empirical @xmath17@xmath30 relationship ( cf . @xcite for review of various ways to estimate @xmath17 ) , whose uncertainty is normally @xmath31 .",
    "more reliable @xmath17 measurements , such as those derived from kinematics or reverberation - mapping , will be adopted if exist , cf .",
    "references in table [ tab1 ] for details .",
    "besides , in order to convert the observed flux to luminosity , the luminosity distance @xmath32 should be given in advance .",
    "because of the luminosity constraint , most of the sources in our sample have @xmath33 mpc . consequently , most of our sources have redshift - independent distance measurements . for most of these sources ,",
    "the distances adopted in this work are from @xcite , where we select distances constrained through the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) method . for the rest few sources that lack redshift - independent distance measurements , we derive @xmath32 from redshift based on the planck2015 flat cosmology @xcite , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the main selection criteria of our sample compilation comes from the x - ray luminosity constraint , i.e. we require the x - ray eddington ratio @xmath36 , a critical luminosity below which the accretion  jet model predicts a jet origin of the x - ray emission ( yc05 ; yyh09 ) . considering the uncertainties in the measurements of @xmath17 , practically this criteria",
    "is slightly weakened to @xmath37 ( cf . the x - axis range of fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] ) .",
    "there is one notable exception  we exclude from our sample sgr a * , whose @xmath38 ( in its quiescent state , cf .",
    "[ fig : fpedd ] ) .",
    "high - resolution radio observations suggest the non - existence of elongated / collimated jet in this system during its quiescent state ( at @xmath39 level , where @xmath40 is the schwardschild radius of bh , see e.g. , @xcite ) , and theoretically the low - frequency radio emission ( e.g. at 5 ghz ) originates from the relativistic power - law distribution electrons within the hot accretion flow itself @xcite , instead of the jet",
    ". moreover , the x - ray emission in sgr a * is dominated by diffuse gas around @xmath41 ( e.g. @xcite ) , unlike that in other normal llagns where it originates from nuclei @xmath42 regions ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". detailed discussion on sgr a * , including its flare state , will be given later in section  [ sec : sgra ] .",
    "as listed in table [ tab1 ] and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] , our final sample includes 75 sources , mainly selected from previous compilations , e.g. , m03 ; @xcite ; yyh09 ; @xcite ; dw15 and @xcite . as shown in fig .",

    "8 sources have upper limit constrains in radio but firm detections in x - rays ( orange open circles in fig .",

    "[ fig : sample ] , this quiescent agn sample covers a large dynamical range in both radio and x - ray eddington ratios , i.e. @xmath44 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : fpedd ] below ) and @xmath45 .",
    "the bh mass of most sources is between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , with a few exceptions , e.g. , @xmath48 for ngc  404 @xcite and @xmath49 for m32 @xcite .",
    "we emphasis that the nuclei of m31 , with @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xcite , represents the faintest ( in eddington unit ) source in our sample .",
    "with the fact that the llagns are expected to vary moderately on timescale of months to years @xcite , the uncertainties of the data mainly comes from the non - simultaneity between radio and x - rays ( note that additionally , the time delay between the two wavebands should be corrected , cf .",
    "section  [ sec : questions ] ) .",
    "considering the systematic and the observational uncertainties , we take isotropic uncertainties with @xmath52 dex , following m03 and g09 .",
    "we consider the following linear ( in logarithmic space ) relationship among three quantities , e.g. , @xmath53 ( in unit of @xmath20 ) , @xmath16 ( in unit of @xmath20 ) and @xmath17 ( in unit of @xmath21 ) , @xmath54    for our statistical analysis , we adopt the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) bayesian analysis ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite , hereafter bayesian approach . )",
    "to derive the best - fit parameters and their corresponding uncertainties ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for this approach , we take the ` python ` routine ` emcee ` @xcite ver . 2.2.1 , which is based on the affine invariant mcmc ensemble sampler method @xcite . besides , we assume the intrinsic scatter of the fp is of gaussian distribution .",
    "moreover , since @xmath16 ( or @xmath55 ) , @xmath53 ( or @xmath56 ) and @xmath17 are symmetric physical quantities during the modelling , we in practice set the model prior probability function @xmath57 to @xcite , @xmath58    we note that the multivariate correlation coefficients shown in several influential works ( among others see e.g. , m03 and g09 ) are derived through minimization of the following statistics ( hereafter least @xmath59 approach ) , @xmath60 although this method can provide reasonable regression coefficients ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , there are indeed some concerns ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for the sake of direct comparison to those previous works , we also provide results under this approach , but our discussions will be mainly based on results derived through the bayesian regression analysis .",
    "technically we use the ` python ` routine ` kmpfit ` of the ` kapteyn ` package ver .",
    "2.3 @xcite , in which the ` c ` implementation of ` mpfit ` @xcite is adopted .",
    "in this section , we present the numerical results based on different approaches .",
    "section  [ sec : allsample ] considers the sample consisting of all the quiescent agns ( 72 sources ) , where both the bayesian and the least @xmath59 methods are adopted ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec : method ] above ) .",
    "section  [ sec : mbhfreesample ] represents the results based on a sub - sample with similar black hole mass ( 42 sources ) .",
    "this is because we want to focus on the value of @xmath3 so we hope to eliminate any possible contamination by the black hole mass .",
    "we find a convergency in both methods , i.e. @xmath611.4 .      here",
    "we investigate the linear relationship among @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , following the methodologies described in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "we first consider a sub - sample of 58 sources , which have firm detections in both radio and x - rays ( hereafter firm - detection subsample ) .",
    "we find that , they follow a fp with parameters constrained as , @xmath65 under the bayesian regression analysis , and @xmath66 under the least @xmath59 approach .",

    "we then analyse the whole quiescent agn sample . under the bayesian approach",
    ", the fitting parameters read , @xmath67 with the intrinsic scatter in @xmath68 to be @xmath69 dex , and under the least @xmath59 method the fitting parameters read , @xmath70 with the intrinsic scatter in @xmath68 to be @xmath71 dex .",
    "the radio / x - ray correlation slope derived above ( e.g. eqs .",
    "[ eq : fpfaint]&[eq : fpfaint_chi2 ] ) is clearly different , at @xmath72 confidence level , from that of the original m03 fp , whose @xmath73 ( see also @xcite for summary of this relationship in bhbs ) .",
    "this fp is in good agreement ( in @xmath3 ) with the prediction of yc05 and the result of yyh09 based on a limited quiescent agn sample .",

    ".  [ eq : fpfaint ] ) .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : fp ] , there are several points worth further emphasis .",
    "first , considering the moderately large scatter in the observational data , the deviation to the original m03 fp ( cf .",
    "the long - dashed curves ) is most evident in m31 ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : fp_dw ] below and @xcite ) , which has lowest @xmath55 and @xmath56 in our sample .",
    "the other sources , on the other hand , are in rough agreement with the original m03 fp ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : fp_dw ] below ) . in this sense , we urge to devote more efforts on sources whose x - ray eddington ratio @xmath77 .",
    "these sources are of crucial importance in confirming the deviation to the original fp , as well as the existence of a new yc05-type fp in these faint / quiescent agns .",
    "secondly , the radio / x - ray correlation slope @xmath3 in quiescent agns can be constrained from a sample which includes quiescent agns only .",
    "if instead the sample also includes numerous brighter sources , the new steep correlation will become invisible .",
    "we will discuss these two issues further in section  [ sec : otherworks ] .",

    "it is evident from this plot that quiescent agns follow a different , steeper , radio / x - ray correlation , compared to the normal llagns and normal agns .",
    "because the physics of accretion and radiation is more relevant to the quantities in eddington unit rather than its absolute values ( such as mass accretion rate and luminosity ) , we further try to find a linear relationship between @xmath291 and @xmath292 for this @xmath17-free subsample . assuming the uncertainty of each quantity is still 0.3 dex , the fitting can be read as , @xmath293 under the bayesian statistics , and @xmath294 under the least @xmath59 approach .",

    "we first discuss the uncertainties of the observational data , i.e. @xmath296 and @xmath297 .    in quiescent agns ( and normal agns also ) , emission at different wavebands likely correlates with considerable time delays .",

    "thus , in order to explore the `` intrinsic '' , physically - connected fp , a correction of the radio / x - ray timelag should be applied . however , in practice such correction is almost impossible for agns , as it requires long - term intense coordinated monitoring in radio and x - rays on individual sources .",
    "moreover , the monitoring should also be able to capture at least one `` outburst '' in each agn , in order to have a reliable measurement of the timelag . with these obstacles / challenges , to date",

    "the agns are variable , with variability amplitude possibly as high as @xmath299 on time - scales shorter than the time interval of observations @xcite .",

    "[ fig : fp ] .",
    "we argue this is actually a misunderstanding , since the radio / x - ray correlation slope can already be determined statistically by abundant other quiescent agns .",
    "we demonstrate this by applying the bayesian analysis to a subsample that further excludes m31 ( 63 sources in total ) .",
    "the correlation coefficients are , @xmath304 consistent with the expectation of a yc05 fp in these systems .",

    "we exclude from the sample data points of bhbs in their quiescent states .",
    "currently there are three bhbs with reported observations in both radio and x - rays during their quiescent states , e.g. a 0620 - 00 @xcite , v404 cyg @xcite and xte j1118 + 480 @xcite .",
    "it is claimed that these sources in their quiescent state follow the extension of the original @xmath305 fp @xcite .",
    "we argue that the claim of original fp down to quiescent states in bhbs is not robust as claimed .",
    "the reasons are as follows ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "first , a 0620 - 00 only have observations in quiescent state , but lacks data in hard state .",
    "secondly , v404 cyg is still too bright , with @xmath306 , to show clear deviation to the original fp . finally , the radio detection of xte j1118 + 480 at @xmath307 is admittedly marginal , at 3@xmath30 level .",
    "moreover , we note that since the correlation is established in a statistical sense .",
    "few individual sources that do not follow the new correlation can not be taken to argue against the existence and correctness of the new relationship .",
    "for example , we note that there also exist some `` outliers '' of the original correlation , as we introduce in _",
    "introduction_.      for the agn sample in literature , there is one source , i.e. sgr a * , that deserves special discussion .",
    "this source , with @xmath308 @xcite , has been included in most previous studies on fp .",
    "however , as emphasised in section  [ sec : sample ] , there are compelling , independent pieces of evidence against the existence of jet in sgr a * during its quiescent state ( e.g. @xcite ) , i.e. it does not satisfy the `` existence of jet '' prerequisite in the study of fp thus should be excluded from the sample . during the quiescent state of sgr a * , the low - frequency radio emission likely originate from the non - thermal electrons of the hot accretion flow , while the x - ray emission is the bremsstrahlung radiation by diffuse gas around @xmath41 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "as shown by the leftmost black asterisk in fig .",
    "[ fig : fp_dw ] , we find that , sgr a * in its quiescent state agrees with the m03 fp ( only a coincidence from our point of view ) , but disagrees with the new @xmath10 fp , as it is more than three orders of magnitude brighter in @xmath53 at the given @xmath16 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "sgr a * undergoes numerous flares , which are observed in sub - millimeter , infrared and x - rays ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these flares usually last 0.1  1 hr @xcite , indicating that they are from nuclear regions of sgr a*. during these flares , the luminosities are enhanced by a factor as much as @xmath309 in radio ( e.g. at @xmath29820 ghz , e.g. , @xcite ) and @xmath298100 ( @xmath298400 in extreme cases ) in x - rays ( 2 - 10 kev , e.g. , @xcite ) , compared to the quiescent `` non - flare '' state .",
    "we note that , interestingly , these radio and x - ray flares are likely produced from jet @xcite .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then sgr a * in its flare state should be included in our quiescent agn sample , and they are qualified to test the fp of quiescent agns .",

    "[ fig : fp ] and [ fig : fp_dw ] , where the flare state of sgr a * is shown by the two black asterisks with @xmath310 ( @xmath311 that of the quiescent state ) and @xmath312 and @xmath313 ( @xmath314 and @xmath315 times that of the quiescent state ) , respectively .",
    "here we only take the enhanced luminosities ( compared to the `` non - flare '' quiescent state ) into account , i.e. only these components are of jet origin .",
    "consistent with our expectation , we find that sgr a * in its flare state agrees nicely with the steep yc05 fp ( cf .",

    "is also excluded from their sample , for reasons listed above .",
    "our work is a natural extension of yyh09 .",

    ", the radio emission of several sources , e.g. , m31 ( @xcite , @xmath317 ) and m32 @xcite , is now firmly detected , while in yyh09 their radio emission only has upper limit constraint .",
    "the main conclusion remains unchanged , i.e. our enlarged sample confirms the discovery of yyh09 .",
    "dw15 recently select from the ( nearly-)complete flux - limited polmar survey a sample of 72 agns , and combine with a large sample of observational data points of bhbs , to investigate the fp jointedly from sub - eddington to quiescent systems .",
    "they claim those with @xmath29 ( 24 agns under a detailed definition of @xmath27 ) seem to follow the original m03 fp , which disagrees with this work ( and yyh09 also ) .",
    "there are mainly two reasons on such discrepancy .",
    "first , notable differences between their sample and ours are observed .",
    "their sample includes the bhbs in their hard and quiescent states , and also sgr a * in quiescent state .",
    "moreover , because their agn sample is limited to data from the polmar survey , the quiescent agn subsample of dw15 lack sufficient number of sources whose x - ray eddington ratios are sufficiently low . for the @xmath318 regime , there are only three sources in their sample ( except sgr a * ) , while there are 17 sources in our sample .",
    "several notable faint sources are missed , e.g. , m31 ( @xcite , @xmath317 ) and ngc  3115 ( @xcite , @xmath319 ) .",
    "these faintest sources , with possibly largest deviation to the original fp , are of crucial importance to reveal the new trend .",
    "secondly , they mainly provide a joint fitting of both normal llagns and quiescent agns , while we focus on the quiescent agns only here .",
    "as illustrated below in section  [ sec : jointfit ] , we argue that the small number of quiescent sources in their sample and a joint fitting are the reasons for the discrepancy between their result and ours .",
    "we here discuss the disadvantages of a joint fitting of a sample that includes both normal llagns and quiescent agns , especially when the steeper correlation is statistically insignificant as the sample lack sufficient number of dimmest sources . for this purpose",
    ", we consider a combined agn sample , including not only the quiescent agns of this work ( hereby named as the xy sample ) but also 28 normal llagns of dw15 ( red open triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fp_dw ] .",
    "note that , except for sgr a * , the rest 44 agns are selected into the xy sample ) .",
    "we note that it has been known for years that some sources do not follow the original m03 fp ( e.g. , @xcite for agns , and @xcite for bhbs .",
    "_ introduction _ ) .",
    "consequently , the exact values of the fitting depend on both sample selection and statistical methods , as noted in @xcite and demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "we analysis the combined sample through the bayesian approach .",
    "the correlation indexes now read as , @xmath320 note that the value of @xmath3 is between the result of dw15 and the present work shown in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "this indicates that the value of @xmath3 is somewhat sensitive to the fraction of quiescent sources included in the sample , more fraction of quiescent ones will make its value larger and the radio / x - ray correlation slope steeper .",
    "this is consistent with our expectation .",
    "now we do the statistical analysis by another way .",
    "we fix the value of @xmath3 and test two - parameter fittings of the combined sample .",
    "we find that both the @xmath4 ( m03-like ) correlation and the @xmath321 ( yc05-like ) correlation could provide almost equally good ( or bad ) fits to the combined sample , i.e. both of which leads to relatively similar reduced @xmath59 values .",
    "consequently it is difficult to judge from statistical instead of physical point of view which fitting is better .",
    "[ fig : fp_dw ] shows the data points of the combined sample plotted against the m03 fp ( left panel ; cf .",
    "m03 ) and the yc05 fp ( right panel ; cf .",

    "for clarity , the quiescent sources shared by both xy and dw15 are now shown as grey filled squares .",
    "for comparison , we show in the two panels the fitting of this combined sample ( eq .  [ eq : fp_w_dw ] ) as grey dashed curve , where @xmath17 is set to @xmath322 . based on the above fitting results as well as the direct comparison between the two panels , we can understand the reason for the discrepancy between this work ( and other similar ones ) and dw15 ( and other similar ones ) .",
    "the first reason has been pointed out already below eq .",
    "[ eq : fp_w_dw ] , i.e. , the correlation index will be determined by the fraction of quiescent sources ( or equivalently normal sources ) whose @xmath16 are far away from @xmath323 included in the sample .",
    "the second reason is that , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fp_dw ] , because the luminosity scales as @xmath324 and the differences in @xmath17 is sufficiently large ( by @xmath2983 orders of magnitude ) in both quiescent and normal low - luminosity agns , the quiescent sources will mix up with those normal ones in @xmath1 and @xmath0 . consequently , quiescent sources that are not dim enough ( in @xmath55 ) will only contribute to the scatter of the original m03 fp , and the yc05 fp will be obscured .",
    "we argue that since the yc05 prediction is based on the difference in @xmath55 rather than @xmath16 , the correct way to examine this prediction is to investigate the sample only consisting of sources with @xmath325 .",
    "this is also more physical since the underlying physics is determined by @xmath55 instead of @xmath16 . a @xmath17-free subsample ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec : mbhfreesample ] ) will help to solve this problem .",
    "indeed , from the @xmath17-selected sample , the quiescent agns do follow a radio / x - ray correlation that is much steeper compared to that followed by those normal ( ll)agns . this result is clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mbhfree ] .    based on this consideration ,",
    "we propose that a better way to analyze the correlation is to replace @xmath53 and @xmath16 with @xmath56 and @xmath55 , and investigate the fp under a revised three - dimensional ( @xmath326 , @xmath327 , @xmath64 ) space . one notable advantage of this new space is that , objects with different eddington ratios will be separated automatically . for a demonstration of this advantage ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fpedd ] the @xmath56  @xmath55 relationship of the combined sample , with additional 10 @xmath17-selected m03 agns . from this plot",
    ", we can see clearly that the correlation slope above and below @xmath328 is different .",
    "the quiescent sources do follow a steeper radio / x - ray correlation compared to that of normal llagns , in agreement with yc05 and our finding in the present paper .",
    "this new parameter space will be very helpful to the investigation of fp at different luminosity regimes ( in eddington unit ) , where a change in the fp may be observed , as a consequence of the change in accretion mode at that luminosity regime ( e.g. @xcite ) .    as a preliminary test , we consider our whole quiescent agn sample ( the xy sample ) .",
    "the scatter of each quantity is fixed to 0.3 dex , for the sake of simplicity . under the bayesian approach we find that , @xmath329 the scatter in @xmath56 is 0.82 dex .",
    "this result can be re - written as @xmath330 .",
    "it is widely known that llagns tend to be radio - loud systematically , and the radio - loudness parameter , defined as @xmath332 , scales inversely with eddington ratios @xmath333 ( among others see e.g. , @xcite ) , where @xmath334 is the bolometric luminosity .",
    "we note that the fp can be re - written as , @xmath335 .",
    "if @xmath334 scales positively with @xmath16 ( likely a reasonable assumption ) , then the yc05 fp , with @xmath336 1.23@xmath337 , predicts that quiescent agns follow a positive @xmath331 ",
    "@xmath333 relationship , opposite to those normal llagns .    fig .",
    "[ fig : r_lbol ] illustrates the distribution of radio - loudness parameter @xmath331 versus eddington ratios for both quiescent agns and normal llagns . for normal llagns ,",
    "we take those from dw15 as representatives . following @xcite",
    ", we estimate the bolometric luminosity simply from the x - ray luminosity , i.e. @xmath338 .",
    "note that those black open circles are sources whose @xmath16 and @xmath53 are upper - limit constraints , i.e. their @xmath331 is actually un - constrained . the black solid and long - dashed curves ,",
    "respectively , show the results derived from the yc05 fp and the original m03 fp , where the bh mass is fixed to @xmath322 . from this figure , the possible turnover at eddington ratio @xmath339 ( or equivalently @xmath340 ; see also @xcite for this value , as constrained by the x - ray spectral properties in agns and bhbs . )",
    "is admittedly less evident .",
    "more observations of quiescent agns with @xmath341 ( or eddington ratio @xmath342 ) are urged to examine this new trend in future .",
    "the fundamental plane provides a direct evidence on the disk - jet connection ( e.g. m03 ; @xcite ; yyh09 ) .",
    "one remaining question under active debate is whether or not those very faint accretion systems ( i.e. , @xmath55 below a critical value @xmath7 ) follow the original m03 fp or the steeper ( in sense of the radio / x - ray correlation slope ) yc05 relationship .",
    "many works favour the yc05 fp ( e.g. , @xcite ; yyh09 ; @xcite ) , while several others favour an universal fp extending down to quiescent / faint systems ( @xcite ; dw15 ) .",
    "in this work we re - visit this problem . for this aim , the quality of the data ( mainly the radio data ) of bhbs is not satisfactory thus the conclusion based on that is not convincing , as we argue in section  [ sec : bhb ] .",
    "therefore we focus on quiescent agns , paying special attention to the radio / x - ray correlation slope @xmath3 .",
    "compared to previous studies , in our work we gather from literature as many faint agns as possible thus our sample is the largest to date , with 5 sources fainter than @xmath343 in x - rays ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] ) .",
    "as we show in the paper , these faint sources are crucial to discriminate different correlations .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows ,    * based on our quiescent agn sample , we find that quiescent agns follow a steeper fp compared to m03 fp .",
    "the radio / x - ray correlation slope @xmath10 , in good consistency with the prediction of yc05 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fp ] ) . * to further focus on the radio / x - ray correlation but eliminate any possible contamination of the black hole mass , we create a sub - sample in which the black hole mass is similar .",
    "for such a @xmath17-free sub - sample , we find that the value of @xmath344 ( fig .  [ fig : mbhfree ] ) .",
    "* we have further explored the reasons for the discrepancy between the present result and some previous ones .",
    "we find that , for the combined agn sample that includes sources of both @xmath345 and @xmath346 , the value of @xmath3 is @xmath347 ( eq .  [ eq : fp_w_dw ] ) , which is between 0.6 and @xmath2981.21.3 .",
    "it is expected that the exact value of @xmath3 in general will be determined by the fraction of quiescent ( or equivalently normal ) sources in the sample .",
    "put it in another way , we find that the @xmath4 correlation and the @xmath321 correlation provide almost equally good ( or bad ) fits to the combined sample , and it is difficult to judge from statistical instead of physical point of view which fitting is better .",
    "we thus argue this approach is not the best way to examine the correlation at quiescent regime . in the traditional approach ,",
    "unless the quiescent sources are extremely faint ( in @xmath55 ) , we can not separate them from normal ones , since they are mixed up with in @xmath16 and @xmath53 due to the large range in black hole mass . consequently",
    ", quiescent sources will only contribute to the scatter of the original fp ( the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fp_dw ] ) . *",
    "given the above reasons , we propose that a better way to investigate the fundamental plane is to use a revised three - dimensional space spanned by @xmath326 , @xmath327 , and @xmath64 .",
    "physically , parameters @xmath56 and @xmath55 have more direct connections to the accretion / jet physics .",
    "one notable advantage of this new space is that , objects with different eddington ratios ( thus may relate to different accretion regimes ) are separated automatically . as shown in the figs .",
