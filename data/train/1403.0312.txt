    "positronium ( ps )  @xcite is a bound state of an electron and a positron .",
    "ground - state positronium has two spin eigenstates : _ ortho-_positronium  ( _ o-_ps , spin @xmath0 , @xmath1-decay , lifetime = 142  ns  @xcite ) and _",
    "para-_positronium  ( _ p-_ps , spin @xmath2 , @xmath3-decay , lifetime = 125  ps  @xcite ) . the energy level of _ o_-ps is higher than that of",
    "_ p_-ps by the hyperfine structure ( @xmath4 )",
    ". compared with the hyperfine structure of hydrogen ( about 1.4  ghz ) , @xmath4 is very large , about 203  ghz ( wavelength @xmath5  mm ) , due to light mass of ps and an s - channel contribution ( 87  ghz ) . since the transition from _",
    "o-_ps to _ p-_ps is forbidden , high - power ( over 10  kw ) millimeter - wave radiation is required to measure the resonance around the hyperfine structure .",
    "many technological difficulties regarding the use of millimeter waves have prevented a direct measurement of this resonance .",
    "measurements using the zeeman effect in a static magnetic field ( @xmath61  t ) have been intensively studied instead of direct measurements .",
    "however , it has been strongly desired to directly examine the breit - wigner resonance from free _",
    "o-_ps to _ p-_ps because properties of ps is derived in a fundamental way by quantum electrodynamics without any external fields .    in this paper ,",
    "we present the first results of the measurement of the resonance transition in ground - state free ps .",
    "we developed a very challenging system of high - power and frequency tunable millimeter - wave devices for this measurement .",
    "as a result of the measurement of the breit - wigner resonance , we can directly determine both @xmath4 and the decay width of _",
    "p-_ps ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "it should be noted that determination of these two values is the first achievement for free ps .",
    "the present work is the first demonstration of spectroscopy by scanning the frequency of high - power millimeter waves .",
    "this new method also paves the way for various measurements in material and life science , such as the dnp - nmr spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopy of the transition from _ o-_ps to _ p-_ps requires frequency - tunable ( 201205  ghz ) and high - power ( over 20  kw ) millimeter waves .",
    "previously  @xcite , a millimeter - wave source , gyrotron , was totally monochromatic ( 202.89  ghz ) and its output profile is an impure gaussian ( about 30% ) .",
    "a fabry - prot cavity which accumulates millimeter waves from the gyrotron was unable to store over 11  kw.we developed two innovative devices in the millimeter - wave range :    1 .   a frequency tunable gyrotron with output of a gaussian profile ( purity is over 95% ) .",
    "2 .   a high - gain fabry - prot cavity withstanding very high power .",
    "figure [ fig : setup1 ] shows the apparatus of our setup .",
    "the fabry - prot cavity is placed inside a gas chamber which will be described later .",
    "the gyrotron is a cyclotron - resonance - maser fast wave device , whose output power ( @xmath8 ) is highest ( @xmath9  w ) in the millimeter - wave range .",
    "an electron beam gyrating in a strong magnetic field ( @xmath10  t ) bunches to a deceleration phase and excites a resonant mode ( millimeter waves ) of a cavity in the gyrotron .",
    "we have successfully developed a new gyrotron ( fu cw gi ) operating in the te@xmath11 mode with an internal mode converter  @xcite.this gyrotron works in pulsed operation ( duty ratio 30% , repetition rate 5  hz ) , with which all data are acquired in synchronization ( events collected during and outside gyrotron pulses are defined as beam - on and beam - off , respectively ) .",
    "the output millimeter - wave beam has a gaussian profile .",
    "the electron beam current is monitored and fed back to control the voltage of the heater of the gyrotron s electron gun .",
    "the power of the output beam was thus stabilized to within @xmath610  % during each measurement ( lasting a few days ) .",
    "the frequency of the gyrotron is tuned between 201  ghz and 205  ghz by using gyrotron cavities of different radius ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the values of the frequency and cavity radius are summarized in table  [ tab : g1_used ] . a far off - resonance point ( @xmath13  ghz )",
    "is obtained by using a different operating mode ( te@xmath14 mode ) .",
    "when the cavity of 2.467  mm was used , we changed the strength of gyrotron s magnetic field so that oscillation frequency moved within q - value of the cavity .",
    "the frequency is precisely measured ( @xmath151  khz ) using a heterodyne detector ( virginia diodes inc . , wr5.1 even harmonic mixer ) .",
    "using this method , we have successfully overcome many difficulties in tuning high - power millimeter waves , which are basically monochromatic .",
    ".operating points.[tab : g1_used ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the systematic errors discussed above are independent , and are therefore summed quadratically to calculate the total systematic error .",
    "the obtained fitting parameters are listed in table  [ tab : result ] .",
    "this is the first direct measurement of both @xmath4 and @xmath7 .",
    "these all are consistent with the theoretical predictions  @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we firstly demonstrate that @xmath4 can be directly determined with the millimeter - wave spectroscopy .",
    "a conventional method is using the zeeman shifted levels caused by a static magnetic field . in a static magnetic field ( @xmath61  t ) ,",
    "one of the _ o-_ps states are mixed with _",
    "p-_ps and the energy level of the mixed _",
    "o-_ps state rises by about 3  ghz compared to the original state .",
    "this zeeman splitting can be precisely measured by an rf , being scanned by strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the value of @xmath4 is calculated via the breit - rabi formula  @xcite . in the 1970s and 1980s , the measurements with",
    "the zeeman effect reached accuracies of ppm level  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the obtained @xmath4 significantly differs by 13  ppm from theoretical predictions calculated in the 2000s  @xcite .",
    "it may be due to underestimated systematic errors in the previous measurement . for example , non - uniformity of the static magnetic field is a candidate of the systematic uncertainty . some independent experiments ( using quantum interference  @xcite , optical lasers  @xcite , and a new method using a precise magnetic field  @xcite ) have been performed .",
    "all of them are measurements using the zeeman intervals .",
    "it is of great importance to re - measure @xmath4 using a method totally different from the previous experiments .",
    "determination of @xmath4 by directly measuring the transition from free _",
    "o-_ps to _ p-_ps is a complementary approach to the measurements using the zeeman effect .",
    "we now discuss three improvements to achieve accuracy of 10  ppm level for @xmath4 :    1 .",
    "using a high - intensity positron beam ( intensity of 7@xmath16e@xmath17/s is available in kek  @xcite ) would increase the statistics by four orders of magnitude because only a few  khz ps is formed inside the fabry - prot cavity using the @xmath18na source .",
    "the statistical error becomes smaller than 10  ppm .",
    "2 .   positronium will be formed in vacuum using an efficient ps converter ( conversion efficiency is around 2050%  @xcite ) . the stark effect",
    "( @xmath19  ppm at 1  atm ) and non - thermalization effect of ps ( about @xmath20@xmath21  ppm ) can be eliminated . since there is no pick - off annihilation in vacuum ,",
    "@xmath22 will be also improved significantly by a factor of two .",
    "3 .   using a megawatt ( mw ) class gyrotron  @xcite@xcite would enable us to precisely ( better than @xmath23  % ) monitor the real power with a calorimeter .",
    "the present accuracy ( @xmath21  % ) of the power estimation is mainly limited by uncertainty of the effective power in the fabry - prot cavity .",
    "the systematic error due to the power can be better than 10  ppm .    all these improvements have been technically achieved in the region of positron science and millimeter - wave technology .",
    "therefore , we can further investigate the disagreement of 4.0 standard deviations between measured @xmath4 and qed theory with the direct measurement firstly reported in this paper .",
    "we firstly measured the breit - wigner resonance of the transition from _",
    "p-_ps with the frequency - tunable millimeter - wave system . both @xmath4 and @xmath7 of free ps",
    "were directly and firstly determined through this resonance .",
    "we pointed out the displacement of @xmath4 between the previous experiments using the zeeman effect and the theoretical calculations can be tested by improving accuracy of this direct experiment .",
    "both direct and indirect measurements would be required to conclusively solve the long - standing problem on the ground - state hyperfine structure of ps .",
    "we would like to express our sincere gratitude to dr .",
    "daniel jeans for useful discussions .",
