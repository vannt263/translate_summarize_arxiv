    "in the recent years a significant body of work has been devoted to the better understanding of the hall effect in the mixed state of type - ii superconductors , which has remained a theoretical puzzle for almost thirty years @xcite the phenomenological @xcite theories predict that the hall angle in the flux - flow regime is either identical to that in the normal state @xcite or constant @xcite , and the underlying microscopic basis for recent generalizations @xcite is not well understood . theories which make use of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equations ( tdgl ) find that the hall conductivity is not modified in the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "these predictions are at variance with the strongly nonlinear behaviour ( as a function of magnetic field ) found in experiments performed on both low-@xmath0 materials @xcite and the high-@xmath0 cuprates @xcite . for dirty superconductors ( @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mean free path and",
    "@xmath3 is the superconducting coherence length ) , transport coefficients can be determined from microscopic theory by a straightforward expansion in powers of the order parameter , @xmath4 .",
    "the results of such a calculation for the transverse resistivity @xcite explain qualitatively the sharp increase in the hall angle below the transition observed in experiment (",
    "although , to our knowledge , no systematic comparison has been made ) , and provide the physical basis for a generalized tdgl approach , in which the relaxation rate is assumed to be complex , rather than purely real , to allow for a modification of the transverse transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "the small parameter in the expansion of the microscopic equations is proportional to both the order parameter and the mean free path , therefore , it is not small in the clean ( @xmath5 ) limit . in this regime",
    "a straightforward expansion is not possible ; the tdgl equations are not applicable @xcite , and so an alternative approach is needed to determine the transverse transport coefficients .    in this work",
    "we develop an approach to calculate the transport coefficients , including the hall effect , of clean type - ii superconductors in the vortex state and present the results of a calculation of the hall conductivity of a clean s - wave superconductor in the mixed state near the upper critical field , @xmath6 .",
    "the method is based on the quasiclassical approximation to the microscopic theory , due originally , in the context of superconductivity , to eilenberger @xcite and larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite , which we generalize to include the terms responsible for the hall effect in a charged superfluid .",
    "we solve the equations of this quasiclassical theory to obtain the longitudinal and transverse resistivities in the mixed state .",
    "we choose to consider an s - wave superconductor as both the normal state and superconducting properties of the low-@xmath0 compounds are well known , and comparison between theory and experiment is fraught with less ambiguity ; however the approach developed here can easily be generalized to consider superconductors with other than s - wave symmetry .",
    "the microscopic green s function contains all the information about the single particle properties of the system .",
    "in particular , it oscillates on length scales of order of the inverse fermi wave vector @xmath7 . however , when calculating transport coefficients , we are for the most part only interested in the long - wavelength response .",
    "it is then sufficient to determine the envelope of the green s function rather than its detailed form . in the quasiclassical approach",
    "the rapid oscillations associated with the presence of the fermi surface are integrated out of the basic equations and slower varying quantities such as external fields or the self energy are expanded around their values at the fermi surface .",
    "the resulting transport like equations contain the microscopic physics relevant to the problem and are easier to solve .",
    "the basic premise of quasiclassical transport theory is that all macroscopic physical quantities vary slowly on a microscopic length scale , and that all the relevant momenta are small compared to the fermi momentum @xmath8 .",
    "this approximation has been applied successfully to study transport phenomena in superfluids @xcite and superconductors @xcite and to investigate the behavior of the unconventional superconductors @xcite .",
    "recently it has been used to analyse the most relevant contributions to the hall effect in a dirty superconductor in the limit of isolated vortices @xcite as well as to investigate the forces acting on a single vortex in the clean regime @xcite .    in the next two sections we present a derivation of the generalized quasiclassical equations , which include all the terms contributing to the hall effect in the mixed state of a clean type - ii superconductor in the high - field regime .",
    "section [ chap : normal ] introduces a general quasiclassical formalism and the basic ideas involved in the analysis of transverse transport in the quasiclassical approximation , illustrated by application to the simple case of a normal metal .",
    "we show how the standard drude results for longitudinal and transverse conductivity are obtained within this quasiclassical approximation . in section [ chap : eqns ]",
    "we use the same approach to derive a generalization of the standard quasiclassical approximation for superconductors to include the terms responsible for the transverse conductivity and obtain linearized transport like equations for a clean superconductor . to solve this system of equations near the upper critical field",
    "we employ the approximation of brandt , pesch and tewordt@xcite ( bpt ) , in which the normal part of the matrix propagator is replaced by its spatial average over a unit cell of the vortex lattice , while the exact spatial dependence of the order parameter is retained . using an operator formalism , we are able to solve the leading order equations for the distribution function in section [ chap : dos ] , and obtain the longitudinal and transverse conductivities within linear response theory in section [ chap : sxx ] and section [ chap : sxy ] respectively . in the last section",

    "the derivation of the quasiclassical equations given here follows the general approach of rainer and serene @xcite and eckern and schmid @xcite .",
    "first we consider the linear response of a metal to a constant uniform electric field described by a vector potential @xmath20 . to incorporate the vector potential into the microscopic equations we replace the momentum operator by its gauge invariant counterpart @xmath21 , and expand this expression to obtain terms linear in the external field . to integrate out the rapid oscillations associated with the presence of the fermi surface we first change variables from @xmath22 and @xmath23 to center of mass and relative coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and carry out a fourier transformation in the latter according to @xmath26 in a translationally invariant system the green s function only depends on the relative coordinate",

    "( [ oprod ] ) of the circle - product this gradient is coupled to derivatives with respect to momentum , and the green s function varies rapidly with momentum near @xmath8 . to avoid this problem",
    "we make a transformation from the set of variables @xmath36 to the set @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a parameterization of the fermi surface , and integrate the quantum mechanical equations over the quasiparticle energy @xmath16 before expanding .",
    "the integrated green s function @xmath39 only depends on the components of momentum parallel to the fermi surface and the remaining dependence on @xmath34 and @xmath27 is slow .",

    "let us first compare terms of zeroth order in the gradient expansion of eqs .",
    "( [ eqmix1])and ( [ eqmix2 ] ) .",
    "since the imaginary time @xmath15 varies between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is temperature , the first term in the equation gives , after integration , a contribution of order @xmath44 .",
    "if we assume that the self energy varies slowly for momenta close to the fermi momentum @xmath45 , we can approximate @xmath46 on the other hand , the term involving @xmath16 gives a much larger contribution since the integration region includes @xmath47 . because of this term and the delta function on the right - hand side the equations can not be integrated directly . instead , we subtract eq .",

    "since the small parameters in the expansion are of order @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a typical wavelength of the electric field , for the terms involving the external vector potential , or , if the self energy is due to impurity scattering , @xmath55 , @xmath16 must always be expanded to one order higher in small quantities than other terms in order to obtain a contribution of similar order .",
    "it should also be emphasized that , since there are several small parameters in the problem , it may be necessary to expand terms to different order in gradients to account for all the contributions to a particular physical quantity .",

    "this is not surprising since in subtracting the right hand dyson s equation from the left hand equation the information about a particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation has been lost .",

    "is enhanced below the upper critical field and has negative curvature in the high field region .",
    "the negative curvature arises from the competition between the enhancement due to the increase in the effective mean free path and the linear decrease of the cyclotron frequency with the field ; the hall conductivity is substantially enhanced when compared to the linear decrease expected from the normal state behavior . while the transverse conductivity is proportional to the square of the scattering time",
    ", the hall angle @xmath366 is only linearly dependent on the scattering time and the corresponding nonlinear dependence on magnetic field is weaker , as can be seen in figure [ fig : tan ] .",
    "finally , as the transverse resistivity @xmath367 is independent of the effective scattering time , it remains linear in magnetic field upon entering the superconducting state with the same slope as in the normal metal .",
    "this behavior is to be contrasted with that of bardeen - stephen model @xcite , where the resistivity is modified and is linear in the magnetic field , but the hall angle obeys the same linear law as in the normal state .",
    "the nozieres - vinen theory @xcite , on the other hand , which predicts that the hall angle should be constant in the flux - flow regime below @xmath6 at variance with the result of this work , also finds that the transverse resistivity is identical to that of the normal state , although the individual components of the conductivity tensor are quite different from those found here .",

    "these experiments find a transverse resistivity in the flux - flow regime which is linear in the applied magnetic field over a wide range of fields below @xmath6 .",
    "the hall angle , however , flattens or even increases above its value at @xmath6 before decreasing at lower fields .",
    "these results are more suggestive of the behavior given here than the original interpretation given in terms of the nozieres - vinen theory . also , the longitudinal resistivity found in ref .",
    "@xcite has a distinct increase in slope just below the upper critical field , which is consistent with the behavior discussed above .",
    "detailed comparisons with the results of this work are difficult to make , since the authors of ref.@xcite used a high current density to reduce the pinning effects and achieve the flux flow regime ; as a result , the magnetoresistance is significant and the longitudinal resistivity in the normal state varies with magnetic field .",
    "we find the qualitative agreement with the experiment encouraging and suggest that more experimental work is needed to make a more detailed comparison with the theory . to conclude ,",
    "we have presented here a new approach to the calculation of the transport coefficients of a clean type - ii superconductor in the vortex state in the high - field regime and used it to determine the hall conductivity and the hall angle of an s - wave superconductor in this regime .",
    "we find that the field dependence of the hall conductivity in the high field regime , which is non - analytic , is entirely due to the change in the density of quasiparticle states at the fermi level in the superconducting state . at the same time we find that the field dependence of the transverse resistivity below the upper critical field remains unchanged .",
