    "the transition between a mott insulator and a metallic phase in one - dimensional ( 1d ) wires has attracted notable interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "different types of transitions are possible , controlled by various physical parameters , such as the electron - electron interaction range and its strength . since the mott state exists only for commensurate fillings ,",
    "the electron filling factor inside the wire is an important parameter , and it can be varied either by controlling the chemical potential , or by doping with a finite number of electrons .",
    "however , these two methods are different : doping with an infinitesimally small number of electrons breaks immediately the mott insulator state , while due to the mott gap , a finite change in the chemical potential is required in order to insert the first electron and cause the transition @xcite .",
    "the metallic phase resulting from doping is usually described by the tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) theory @xcite , although for a small finite doping , a large curvature of the elementary excitation spectrum is expected , and deviations from the tll theory are possible . in the tll ,",
    "many physical properties are determined by the parameter @xmath0 which describes the interactions .",
    "recently , a discontinuity in the occupation of a resonant level which is coupled to a tll with @xmath1 was predicted by furusaki and matveev @xcite . however , since the @xmath1 regime corresponds to very strong repulsive interactions , neither experimental nor numerical evidence for such a jump has been obtained so far .    as a generic model for the wire",
    "it is convenient to use a tight - binding description of a 1d lattice with spinless electrons .",
    "when repulsive interactions between nearest - neighbor electrons are considered , the mott state , taking the form of a charge density wave ( cdw ) , occurs for strong enough interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a system can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the nearest - neighbor interaction strength , and the hopping matrix element between nearest neighbors , @xmath4 , sets the energy scale .",
    "@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of a spinless electron at site @xmath7 in the @xmath8-site wire , and a positive background is included in the interaction term .    the model of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : h_wire ] ) is equivalent to that of the xxz spin @xmath9 chain by the jordan - wigner transformation@xcite .",
    "the xxz model is exactly solvable using the bethe ansatz @xcite . from this equivalence",
    "it is known that for a half filled system with periodic boundary conditions , a phase transition between a tll phase and a cdw one occurs at @xmath10 . of course , for sufficiently long wires the type of the boundary conditions does not change this result @xcite .",
    "the interaction parameter @xmath0 is then given by @xcite @xmath11 so that in the tll phase , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , while for @xmath14 , the half filled wire is no longer in the tll phase , but is rather in a cdw state .",
    "the competition between the tll and the cdw phases is attributed to the presence of umklapp processes in this model . for half filling the cdw phase wins over the tll phase once the interactions are strong enough .",
    "however , when the wire is not exactly half filled , a cdw state can not emerge since it demands a commensurate filling , and thus the tll description is valid even for interaction values which are greater than @xmath15 . as a result , for strong enough interactions , and sufficiently close to half filling",
    ", one can then get values of @xmath0 which are less than @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite    another approach to treat the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : h_wire ] ) is to map it , using bosonization @xcite , into that of the sine - gordon model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the elementary excitations are solitons , which carry half an electron charge @xcite . in the vicinity of the mott state",
    "the value of the tll interaction parameter is @xmath16 .",
    "the value @xmath17 , which can not be obtained using this model , corresponds to the luther - emery line , for which the solitons are effectively non interacting @xcite . for small deviations from half filling the solitons are only weakly interacting .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effects of a finite doping on a 1d mott state .",
    "we show that although a small number of electrons results in an insulator - metal transition , the charge distribution in the metallic system with a finite number of electrons is not uniform , but rather corresponds to an incommensurate cdw .",
    "the added charge can also be considered as delocalized solitons in the original commensurate cdw , whose spatial distribution is determined by boundary conditions and symmetry considerations .",
    "nevertheless , the system is conducting , and once a bias voltage is applied the solitons are free to move and transport charge across the wire .",
    "an exceptional behavior is exhibited when a lattice with an even number of sites @xmath18 is occupied by @xmath19 electrons , i.e. , there is a single additional electron ( or hole ) relative to half filling . as will be shown , in this case the insulating behavior of the original mott state",
    "is retained even though the filling is incommensurate .",
    "this unusual case will be explained as a result of subgap states in the soliton energy spectrum .",
    "in addition , we show that since the mott state with a small doping allows for the interaction parameter in the range @xmath20 , it might exhibit the furusaki - matveev discontinuity .",
    "the appearance of that jump is not a foreclosed conclusion , since the model used by furusaki and matveev does not contain umklapp processes .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the jump indeed occurs , and show its implications on the solitons present in the wire near half filling .",
    "since the cdw state is obtained for exactly half filling , it is convenient to denote the extra charge by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the number of electrons in the system .",
    "as will be shown , the parity of @xmath8 plays a significant role in the behavior when adding the first few electrons . using the finite - size version of the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath23 was diagonalized and the ground state was calculated for different values of the charge @xmath24 and the lattice size @xmath8 . in the current paper we present results obtained for @xmath25 , which is deep inside the cdw regime ( for half filling ) .",
    "nevertheless , other interaction strengths in the regime of @xmath14 have been checked as well , and were found to lead to qualitatively similar results .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section , sec .",
    "[ sec : cdw ] , we present the charge occupation along nearly half filled wires , which demonstrates the presence of incommensurate cdw or solitons . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mit ] we discuss the excitation spectrum of the solitons , and the addition spectrum of the system . for systems which are exactly half filled , or doped with only one electron or hole ,",
    "we show that the ground state is insulating ; otherwise , it is conducting . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fmj ] we discuss the existence of the furusaki - matveev jump when the doped wire is coupled to a resonant level .",
    "finally we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "we begin by presenting the occupation of electrons along the wire for different numbers of extra electrons @xmath24 for wires with an odd or an even number of sites ( fig .",
    "[ fig : l500_sol ] ) . the @xmath26 case ( for an even @xmath8 ) results in a flat distribution of @xmath27 for each lattice site @xmath7 ( dashed line ) .",
    "this state is a linear combination of two degenerate cdw states , which are eigenstates of the hamiltonian in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "these cdw states , which are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : l500_sol ] , are numerically obtained by applying an infinitesimally small potential on the first site , which breaks the degeneracy between them@xcite .",
    "the population of such a cdw state along the wire ( near the center ) can be written as @xmath28 where the amplitude @xmath29 depends on the interaction strength , @xmath30 is the filling , and @xmath31 is a phase .",
    "( color online ) the electrons occupation in a lattice of @xmath32 sites ( upper panel ) and @xmath33 sites ( lower panel ) for different number of electrons .",
    "the values near the curves denote the extra charge @xmath24 which varies between @xmath26 for half filling and @xmath34 . ]",

    "the values near the curves denote the extra charge @xmath24 which varies between @xmath26 for half filling and @xmath34 . ]",
    "when @xmath35 , the ground state is no longer degenerate and the electron occupation throughout the lead is not uniform .",
    "let us start with the @xmath36 case ( when @xmath8 is odd ) , which results in a true cdw state , i.e. , for each even ( odd ) site the occupation is low ( high ) . unlike the case of the degenerate ground states for @xmath26 , the @xmath36 ground state",
    "is not coupled by the hamiltonian to the similar cdw ground state of @xmath37 due to the difference in their total population .    in order to explore the addition of electrons onto the cdw states , one can take the uniform distribution of the @xmath26 state as a reference , and investigate the difference from it by calculating the accumulated population @xmath38 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dn_j ] , @xmath39 for each of the two clean cdw states of @xmath26 ( presented in solid lines ) , has an extra charge of @xmath40 localized at one of the wire edges , and a compensating charge ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) localized at the other .",
    "the difference between these two states is thus a soliton ( of charge @xmath42 ) located at one edge of the wire and an antisoliton ( of charge @xmath43 ) at the other edge .    by taking one of the @xmath26 cdw states , and locating a soliton at its negatively charged edge , while leaving the other edge",
    "as it is , one gets a new cdw state in which both edges have a positive charge , i.e. , a cdw state having @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , placing an antisoliton at the edge with the positive charge of the @xmath26 state results in the @xmath37 cdw state .",
    "these states are also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : dn_j ] ( dashed lines ) .    for the @xmath44 case ( when @xmath8 is even ) , adding a localized soliton near one of the edges is not sufficient , and it requires the addition of another charge of @xmath42 .",
    "this extra charge is obtained by the formation of a delocalized soliton , centered at the middle of the wire .",
    "further increase of the filling above @xmath36 ( @xmath44 ) for odd ( even ) wire lengths , results in the addition of two delocalized solitons for every electron , so that the total number of delocalized solitons is @xmath45 .",
    "1truecm    1truecm    the delocalized solitons , which carry a charge of @xmath42 each , are free to move along the wire . however ,",
    "when no bias voltage is applied , the charge distribution across the wire is fixed by the boundaries and by symmetry considerations .",
    "practically these constraints lead to a density wave with a cosine term similar to that of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : n_j_cdw ] ) , in which the filling factor @xmath46 is modified .",
    "this statement is true for much larger values of @xmath24 as well .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ fig : l300_n14 ] shows the electron distribution for a @xmath47-site wire with @xmath48 , i.e. , with @xmath49 delocalized solitons .",
    "it is easy to see that although the amplitude of the oscillations is reduced , it does nt vanish and it is rather constant near the middle of the wire .",
    "moreover , the oscillations can still be fitted to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : n_j_cdw ] ) using @xmath46 as a fitting parameter .",
    "as can be expected , this results in a value of @xmath46 which matches the filling of the wire .",
    "the non - uniform charge distribution for a fixed number of electrons is not a finite - size effect , and survives in the thermodynamic limit as well . in fig .",
    "[ fig : l300_600_n14_28 ] one can see a comparison between wires of @xmath47 and @xmath50 sites , with @xmath48 and @xmath51 .",
    "one can see weaker oscillations in the @xmath51 case , attributed to a smaller wave length . on the other hand , increasing the size of the lead from @xmath52 to @xmath53 while maintaining the number of extra electrons @xmath24 constant , results in an increase of the oscillations .",
    "one can thus conclude that on the one hand the oscillations are expected to vanish if a finite filling fraction is considered , i.e. , in the limit of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , keeping @xmath56 constant . on the other hand , when a finite number of electrons is added , the oscillations are expected to be noticed even in the limit of @xmath55 .",
    "up to now we have shown that the density distribution of the electrons along the wire , when it is doped by a finite number of electrons , is not flat , and preserves some features of the mott state .",
    "one can still wonder whether these doped states retain the insulating behavior of the mott state or not . to clarify that point",
    "we study the size dependence of the addition spectrum , defined through @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the ground - state energy of the wire with @xmath24 electrons above half filling . for a mott state",
    "the limit of @xmath59 , as @xmath55 , should be a finite value , corresponding to the gap size , while for a conducting state one expects @xmath60 .",

    "a deviation from this intuitive picture appears for @xmath44 , in which an unexpected gap of @xmath64 occurs .",
    "nevertheless , this result can be explained by the spectrum of soliton states near half filling .",
    "it is known that for solitons in the sine - gordon model with open boundary conditions there are two degenerate subgap states at zero energy , positioned exactly between the conduction and the valence bands , each of them localized near one of the edges of the system @xcite . in our case",
    "these subgap states are thus the localized solitons , which we identified as the difference between the two cdw states of @xmath26 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : l500_sol ] .",
    "thus the energy spectrum of the solitons is represented by valence and conduction bands separated by a gap @xmath65 , while the subgap states exist at @xmath66 above the valence band ( see schematic picture in fig .",
    "[ fig : ebands ] ) .",
    "the filling of the subgap states with the localized solitons does not change the total energy .",

    "we have demonstrated the existence of cdw states for @xmath26 and @xmath67 , and shown that these states are insulating .",
    "the ground states with @xmath93 were found to be insulating as well , with an excitation gap which is half of the mott gap .",
    "states with @xmath81 are conducting and thus should be generally described by the tll theory .",
    "nevertheless , we have found that the spatial distribution of the electron density is not uniform as in the regular tll picture .",
    "furthermore , this distribution can be fitted to an incommensurate cdw form .",
    "it is therefore interesting to explore some other predictions of the tll theory for such states .",
    "the unconventional behavior of the gapless states with the non - uniform density can be illustrated by studying the discontinuity in the occupation of a resonant level coupled to the wire @xcite . as mentioned above ,",
    "once @xmath94 , the level is expected to show a jump in its occupation as a function of its energy .",
    "nevertheless , one should note that umklapp processes , which are an essential ingredient in explaining the behavior of our system , were not considered in the theoretical framework of ref .  .",
    "furthermore , since here the particle distribution in the uncoupled wire is not flat , the occurrence of the furusaki - matveev discontinuity raises an additional question .",
    "if the electrons occupation profile along the uncoupled wire was uniform , one should have observed friedel oscillations in the wire as soon as it is coupled to the resonant level .",
    "the potential of the resonant level can then be continuously changed until the predicted jump in the level occupation occurs . at that point , an inversion of the friedel oscillations along the wire is expected . on the other hand ,",
    "once the wire is a mott state doped by a finite number of electrons and the electron density is not uniform , the situation is less clear .",
    "we first calculate the value of @xmath0 for the doped mott state , and show that it is below @xmath9 . in order to have the same value of @xmath0 for different lengths of wires",
    ", one must consider an equal density of additional electrons , and we choose to work with doping of @xmath95 , with wires of sizes @xmath96 sites and above .",
    "@xmath0 may be obtained @xcite by the ratio between @xmath97 , the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state , and the addition spectrum @xmath59 , since for spinless electrons with open boundary conditions @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "more accurate result may be obtained by fitting both @xmath100 and @xmath101 to a polynom in @xmath102 , and then obtaining @xmath0 from the ratio of the linear coefficients @xcite . using both methods",
    "we find that the value of @xmath0 for our wire is @xmath103 .    in order to represent the coupling of a resonant level or an impurity of energy @xmath104 to the left edge of the wire the following term is added to the hamiltonian : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron in the resonant level , and @xmath107",
    "is the hopping matrix element between the level and the first site of the wire .",
    "interaction between the impurity and the wire is not considered here since it does not change the result qualitatively , but only causes a renormalization of the hopping amplitude @xmath107 towards larger values @xcite .",
    "the level occupation @xmath108 as a function of the level energy @xmath104 is presented in fig .  [ fig : fmj_slope_l ] for different wire lengths using @xmath109 .",
    "as mentioned above , wires in different lengths contain different number of additional electrons using @xmath95 , and @xmath110 .",
    "when @xmath104 is much larger than the chemical potential in the wire @xmath111 , the impurity is almost empty , and the wire contains most of the @xmath24 extra electrons . on the other hand , for @xmath112",
    "the impurity is almost entirely occupied , and then only @xmath113 extra electrons are in the wire .",
    "although the population of the impurity is found to be continuous for all finite wire lengths studied , it is expected to display an abrupt jump in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath55 . in order to demonstrate this we study the dependence of the occupation slope near @xmath114 on the wire length @xmath8 . as is clearly seen in the inset of fig .",
