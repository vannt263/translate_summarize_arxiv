    "the static and dynamic behaviour of sliding charge density waves ( cdws ) is perhaps the most well studied example of a class of problems involving the transport of an elastic medium through a disordered background .",
    "the cdw , which behaves like an elastic medium , is pinned by impurities distributed randomly throughout the material . as the magnitude of an externally applied electric field",
    "is varied , a depinning transition is seen , from a stationary phase at weak fields , to a moving phase at strong fields where the cdw slides through the material . in the vicinity of this depinning transition ,",
    "the dynamics of the cdw are correlated over long distances , with characteristic correlation lengths diverging at the threshold field .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the behaviour near the threshold field can be studied as a critical phenomenon associated with a second order phase transition.@xcite    extensive numerical simulations@xcite on a number of classical models for cdws have helped in understanding the critical properties in the vicinity of the depinning transition . in particular ,",
    "critical exponents describing the scaling of physical quantities can be determined for various spatial dimensions of the cdw .",
    "recently , it has also proved possible to obtain analytically the behaviour in the moving phase above threshold , through a renormalization group treatment.@xcite the results , obtained within an @xmath2-expansion for @xmath3 spatial dimensions , agree very well with the numerical simulations .    while the critical behaviour above threshold is fairly well understood , it is more difficult to carry out an analytical treatment below threshold .",
    "the reason why the analysis is simpler in the moving phase is that , for models in which the elastic interactions within the cdw are strictly convex , and no dislocations ( `` phase slips '' ) are allowed , the system approaches a unique steady - state configuration at long times ( up to time translations).@xcite a perturbation expansion around some relatively simple configuration is thus more likely to succeed . in the stationary phase ,",
    "on the other hand , the impurities can pin the cdw in any of several different states ; the particular state that the cdw reaches depends on the past history of the system .",
    "any analytical treatment must include this history dependence , instead of being the simple search for a single attractor , as is sufficient above threshold .",
    "the history dependence of the cdw below threshold is most easily seen in the polarizability .",
    "if the driving force @xmath4 ( produced by the external electric field ) is raised monotonically towards the depinning threshold @xmath5 , the response @xmath6 to infinitesimal increases in the force becomes larger and larger , and diverges at @xmath5 as @xmath7 , with an exponent @xmath8 .",
    "also , at any value of @xmath4 , the response of the cdw to increasing the force further is dominated by localized regions of activity , or `` avalanches '' , whose characteristic size can be used to define a diverging correlation length @xmath9 .",
    "if instead of this monotonic approach , the force is _ lowered _ from just below threshold , the polarizability @xmath10 does not diverge at @xmath5 ( although , depending on the specific model used for the cdw , it may have a cusp singularity ) .",
    "it is thus necessary to distinguish between the upwards polarizability , @xmath6 , and the downwards polarizability @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    ", we show how it is possible to obtain analytically the critical behaviour for the ` natural ' monotonic approach to threshold , through an expansion around the mean field solution with the proper history dependence .",
    "our results are in good agreement with recent numerical simulations , as well as new data that we present here .",
    "we find that the correlation length exponent is given by @xmath11 for a @xmath12 dimensional system , while the polarizability exponent is @xmath13 these exponents can in fact be obtained for a highly simplified cdw model@xcite that can be solved exactly .",
    "however , the dynamic exponent @xmath14 _ can not _ be obtained from this model : we show that @xmath14 is equal to its value above threshold @xmath15 in @xmath3 dimensions . later in this paper , we discuss how the model of ref",
    ". corresponds to a pathological limit , and why , despite this , it obtains @xmath16 and @xmath8 correctly .",
    "the solution that we obtain is similar in form to the solution above threshold.@xcite however , there are complications with two - sided scaling .",
    "this is because , as was seen above threshold , there is an extra relevant operator at the fixed point of the renormalization group , which affects only the statics and not the dynamics .",
    "this operator has very different consequences in the pinned and moving phases of the cdw , resulting in different correlation length exponents on the two sides of the phase transition .",
    "the absence of two - sided scaling is unlike the behaviour for phase transitions in equilibrium systems , and conventional arguments about the properties of scaling functions must be used with caution here .    in `` phase - only '' models for cdws",
    ", the cdw is described by a periodic modulation in the density of electrons in the material ; the phase of this modulation is assumed to be the only dynamical variable of importance and is assumed to be a continuous function of position .",
    "in numerical simulations , the system is discretized to a lattice , with a continuous phase variable at each site .",
    "although simulations on such continuous variable models have been performed@xcite , it is much more efficient to simplify the model , with the phase of the cdw at any lattice site restricted to being an integer multiple of @xmath17 away from a ( site dependent ) preferred phase , and time being incremented in discrete steps.@xcite the resulting automaton models , which differ in details of how these approximations are made , yield far more precise results . within the numerical uncertainties ,",
    "much of the critical behaviour is the same for both classes of models . in particular , the correlation length exponent @xmath16 and ( with larger numerical uncertainties )",
    "the polarizability exponent @xmath8 appear to be the same .",
    "an important exception to this is the downward polarizability , @xmath18 : as already mentioned , the nature ( or even the existence ) of a cusp singularity in @xmath18 _ does _ depend on the details of the model used , and is in fact even different in different continuous variable models .",
    "however , this difference is not seen in the monotonic approach , which is what we shall be interested in here .    since the approach to threshold causes the system to become increasingly unstable , with larger and larger avalanches and a divergent polarizability , it is perhaps not surprising that differences between automaton and continuous dynamics do not affect the critical behaviour .",
    "an important exception to this rule is the distribution for the _ number _ of avalanches . for continuous dynamics ,",
    "an infinitesimal increase in @xmath4 triggers avalanches in which the change in the phase at any point is bounded above by @xmath17 ( corresponding to unity in the automaton models ) .",
    "most of the avalanche area advances by almost @xmath17 . in large avalanches , it is highly probable that a subsequent small increase in @xmath4 will `` retrigger '' avalanches in the same region , as the original unstable point is likely to be nearly unstable at the completion of the first avalanche .",
    "avalanches of usually decreasing size will be retriggered until the region is more stable . in the automaton models , owing to the discretization of the cdw phases",
    ", several `` retriggered '' avalanches are grouped together into a single large avalanche .",
    "this difference between the two classes of models is one that involves the behaviour at _ short times _ ; this does not alter long - wavelength low - frequency characteristics that determine @xmath16 and @xmath14 ( nor @xmath8 , which involves a spatial average over the entire system ) .",
    "however , it may affect avalanche distributions , which do depend on how avalanches are grouped .",
    "in this paper we present numerical data on the distribution of avalanches for the automaton models , and examine the differences with results for continuous variable models .",
    "the automaton models for cdws are closely related to some of the sandpile models that have been proposed and studied recently.@xcite we find that the avalanche distribution that we obtain here for the cdw automaton models agrees very well with the numerical results on sandpiles at the critical point.@xcite the dynamic exponent , @xmath14 , that relates the characteristic duration of an avalanche to its size , is also found to be the same numerically for both classes of models : @xmath19 the _ approach _ to threshold for sandpile models has been treated through numerics and scaling arguments by tang and bak@xcite ; our results differ in certain respects from theirs , which we discuss in detail later in this paper .    the connection between sandpiles and cdw models can be exploited to obtain the dynamic exponent @xmath14 for two dimensional systems .",
    "majumdar and dhar@xcite have shown that this exponent is equal to @xmath20 for sandpile models in @xmath21 ; this is in fair agreement with the numerical results for cdws.@xcite they are also able to relate the two exponents that enter the avalanche distribution to each other , thus leaving only one of the two to be determined numerically . in this paper",
    "we show that it is in fact possible to obtain the same exponent identity from completely different scaling arguments on cdws , if we assume that the total rate of avalanche generation ( which is dominated by _",
    "small _ avalanches ) is not singular as threshold is approached .",
    "( we have verified this assumption numerically for the automaton models . )    the rest of this paper is organized in the following manner .",
    "section ii carries out the analytical treatment of the behaviour below threshold , and obtains the critical exponents .",
    "section iii examines the numerical results , which agree quite well with the analytical predictions .",
    "section iv compares the distribution of avalanches for cdw continuous dynamics , cdw automata , and sandpile models , as well as exploring other connections to sandpile models .",
    "section v discusses the relationship of this work to earlier results , and its possible relevance to other physical systems .",
    "the model that we use in this section is the fukuyama - lee - rice model,@xcite which assumes that the distortions of the cdw are continuous ( _ i.e. _ that there are no dislocations ) .",
    "the dynamics can then be expressed in terms of a phase variable , @xmath22 , which measures the distortions with respect to an ideal undistorted cdw .",
    "( the position @xmath23 is a @xmath12-dimensional vector . ) assuming that the dynamics are strongly overdamped , and are given by a simple relaxation of an energy functional @xmath24 , the equation of motion is @xmath25 in eq.([flr ] ) there are three terms on the right hand side : a simple elastic force that arises from an elastic energy @xmath26 , a uniform force @xmath4 from the external electric field , and a force @xmath27 from the impurity pinning .",
    "this impurity force has an explicit dependence on the position @xmath23 , arising from the quenched randomness in the location of the impurities , through the functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 . these correspond physically to the strength of the impurity pinning , @xmath28 , and a preferred phase @xmath29 selected by the impurities .",
    "( in order to fix the normalization of @xmath30 , we choose @xmath31 to have a maximum value of 1 . ) since the impurities have only short range correlations , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are taken to be uncorrelated from one position to another , with a distribution @xmath32 for @xmath30 and a uniform distribution over @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "the pinning force is the derivative , @xmath35 of an impurity pinning potential .",
    "because of the @xmath17 translational invariance of the cdw , the force @xmath36 has to be @xmath17-periodic in @xmath37 .",
    "among the quantities of physical interest in this model below threshold are the polarization , @xmath38 , defined as the mean displacement from some initial configuration of the phase @xmath37 ; close to threshold , the singular part of @xmath38 scales as @xmath39_s \\sim(f_t - f)^{-\\gamma+1}.\\label{polarz}\\ ] ] the derivative of this with respect to @xmath4 is the upwards polarizability , defined earlier as the response to an infinitesimal increase in @xmath4 , which scales as @xmath40/\\delta f\\sim ( f_t - f)^{-\\gamma}.\\label{suscep}\\ ] ]    in ref . , the behaviour above threshold for models of this type was analyzed .",
    "this was done by expanding around the solution of eq.([flr ] ) within a mean field approximation , which is obtained by replacing the short - ranged elastic term @xmath41 with an infinite - ranged interaction , @xmath42 .",
    "the mean field solution is known to depend on the details of the pinning potential @xmath43 : for instance , the velocity above threshold scales as @xmath44 in the critical regime,@xcite with an exponent @xmath45 for smooth pinning potentials@xcite and @xmath46 for pinning potentials which have wedge - shaped linear cusped maxima.@xcite this lack of universality arises from the fact that , for smooth pinning potentials , when the phase @xmath37 at any site passes through an unstable point in its local effective potential , it spends a long time accelerating before jumping forward to a new stable state .",
    "this results in a second time scale that diverges at threshold ( in addition to the natural scale of @xmath47 ) .",
    "no such second divergent time scale is present for linear cusped potentials , for which the acceleration time remains of @xmath48 arbitrarily close to threshold . despite this difference in behaviour for the two types of potentials in mean field theory ,",
    "numerically it is found that the critical behaviour is _ independent _ of the shape of the pinning potential for @xmath49 , and is in fact even the same for automaton models . in ref . , it was argued that this is because the dynamics for small @xmath12 are very irregular : when the phase at any site jumps forward , it produces a sharp force on all the neighbours to which it is elastically coupled . for large @xmath12 ,",
    "the total elastic force acting on any phase is the sum of contributions from a large number of neighbours ; however , as @xmath12 is decreased , the elastic force becomes more and more jerky .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath12 , the phase @xmath37 of the cdw at any site is ` kicked ' by its neighbours over the maximum of the local effective potential it experiences .",
    "the details of the pinning potential are no longer important , and the second divergent time scale is eliminated , restoring universality .",
    "the expansion around mean field theory was accordingly carried out for linear cusped potentials , for which the second time scale is absent initially , so that the expansion is better behaved .",
    "when @xmath5 is approached monotonically from below threshold , the critical behaviour is controlled by large avalanches , in which the cdw phase in localized regions moves forward abruptly in response to a small change in the field . since the collapse to universality above threshold",
    "was understood in terms of the jerky dynamics , the same should be true even below threshold .",
    "this is indeed found to be the case numerically .",
    "thus even below threshold , we seek to expand around the mean field solution for linear cusped potentials .    before proceeding with the calculations ,",
    "it is necessary to consider a possibility that might make this procedure erroneous .",
    "while we have answered the question of history dependence by choosing a specific approach to threshold , namely increasing @xmath4 monotonically , this does not completely eliminate problems that arise from the existence of many metastable states .",
    "an expansion around the mean field solution of the type we develop here corresponds to first increasing the force within an infinite ranged model , and then tuning the elastic coupling to a short ranged form ( _ i.e. _ , restoring the @xmath41 term in eq.([flr ] ) which was replaced by @xmath50 in mean field theory ) . on the other hand",
    ", the physically relevant critical behaviour corresponds to _ first _ tuning the elastic coupling to a short ranged form , and _ then _ increasing the force _ within _ a short ranged model . when there are many metastable solutions , as is the case below threshold , the two methods could in principle yield different critical behaviour .    since the cdw phase at any site moves only forward when the force is raised monotonically , such problems from metastability could arise if reducing the range of the elastic interactions from a mean field theory were to result in the phases at different sites trying to move _",
    "backwards_. while this will of course be true for _ some _ of the phases , for which the coupling to their neighbours tends to retard their motion , we shall see later in this paper that the polarizability exponent @xmath8 is in fact larger for @xmath49 than in mean field theory .",
    "thus the dominant effect of reducing the range of the elastic interactions is to make the phases move _ forward _ , making the polarization ( and hence the polarizability ) more divergent than in mean field theory .",
    "we therefore expect our procedure of expanding around the mean field solution to yield the correct critical behaviour .",
    "the expansion around mean field theory is carried out following the prescription of sompolinsky and zippelius;@xcite the details are given in ref .. the method yields an impurity averaged generating functional for the correlation and response functions of the phase @xmath37 , of the form @xmath51&[&d\\hat\\phi]\\exp\\{-\\int d^d x dt\\,\\hat\\phi(x , t)[\\partial_t-\\nabla^2+r]\\phi(x , t)+\\hat\\phi(x , t ) [ f - f_{mf}(\\langle\\phi(t)\\rangle)]\\qquad\\nonumber\\\\   & - & \\int d^dx dt_1 dt_2\\,\\hat\\phi(x , t_1 ) \\hat\\phi(x , t_2 ) c[\\langle\\phi(t_1)\\rangle+\\phi(x , t_1)-\\langle\\phi(t_2)\\rangle -\\phi(x , t_2)]\\}.\\label{genfunc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath52 and @xmath53 are dummy field variables , in terms of which the long wavelength low frequency forms of the truncated correlation and response functions of @xmath37 are given by @xmath54 where the left hand side represents the generalized response to a perturbing force @xmath55 added to the right hand side of eq.([flr ] ) , and the right hand side is the expectation value using the measure of eq.([genfunc ] ) .",
    "@xmath56 is like a coarse grained version of the phase @xmath57 .",
    "it gives the deviations of @xmath57 from its spatially averaged value , @xmath58 , and must satisfy the consistency condition @xmath59 , which determines @xmath60 .",
    "various other terms , that do not affect the critical behaviour , have been suppressed in eq.([genfunc ] ) .",
    "eq.([genfunc ] ) is similar to the generating functional obtained in ref . above threshold , except for new terms that we discuss in the next paragraph .",
    "the function @xmath61 is the same as the mean field phase phase correlations as a function of time _ above _ threshold : @xmath62[\\phi(t_2)-vt_2]\\rangle$ ] .",
    "below threshold , the spatial average of the phase , @xmath63 , replaces @xmath64 . for any value of @xmath58 ,",
    "the function @xmath65 is the force that would result in an average displacement @xmath58 in the mean field approximation to eq.([flr ] ) , while the function @xmath4 is the force that would produce the same average displacement in the full short - ranged model of eq.([flr ] ) . as mentioned in the previous paragraph , the difference between these two , which is the coefficient of the second term in eq.([genfunc ] ) , can be found by the consistency condition @xmath59 .",
    "this again is similar to the case above threshold .    despite the similarities ,",
    "there are important differences between eq.([genfunc ] ) and the corresponding generating functional above threshold@xcite .",
    "there is a non - zero ` mass term ' in eq.([genfunc ] ) , @xmath66 , which results in a finite response of @xmath37 to a spatially uniform dc force . above threshold , where this term vanishes exactly due to time translational invariance of the system",
    ", @xmath67 has a @xmath68 singularity , corresponding to a finite response in the _ velocity _ of @xmath37 .",
    "the bare value of @xmath69 is the inverse of the mean field polarizability @xmath6 ( along the monotonically increasing path ) ; @xmath69 vanishes at threshold , although the manner in which it approaches zero at @xmath5 depends on the distribution @xmath32 of the pinning strengths .",
    "the generating functional @xmath70 also differs from the form above threshold by various other terms that also vanish at threshold like @xmath71 does .",
    "for instance , the coefficient of the second term , @xmath72 has corrections of @xmath73 ^ 2)$ ] .",
    "these , however , do not affect the critical behaviour and are not shown in eq.([genfunc ] ) . also , it is only when the mean field correlation and response functions are evaluated within the monotonically increasing approach to threshold that we obtain the functional forms in eq.([genfunc ] ) that resemble those above threshold . for other ( non - monotonic ) approaches",
    ", this will not be the case . above threshold , where the steady state behaviour is unique",
    ", no particular path needs to be specified .",
    "the variable @xmath63 in the arguments of the functions @xmath74 and @xmath61 in eq.([genfunc ] ) implicitly controls the dependence on @xmath4 .",
    "it is necessary to increase @xmath63 _ adiabatically _ in order for the form in eq.([genfunc ] ) to be valid ; otherwise , there would be various transients that would have to be included in the equation .",
    "since the increase of the force is much slower than all the dynamics of the cdw , the equal time response and correlation functions really give the _",
    "static _ behaviour .",
    "although it would seem that eqs.([genfunc ] ) and ( [ mapping ] ) can be used to obtain responses to time dependent perturbations , there is an implicit constraint that the perturbing force must satisfy for our entire approach to be valid : @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "this constraint prevents us from obtaining the ac response , @xmath77 .",
    "we now carry out a renormalization group analysis of eq.([genfunc ] ) along the lines of ref .. we rescale space and time as @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and integrate out modes of all frequencies in the momentum shell between the ( rescaled ) momenta @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where @xmath81 is the upper cutoff in momentum .",
    "the rescaling of the fields @xmath52 and @xmath53 are fixed in mean field theory by the requirement that all quadratic terms in the exponential have to be invariant under this transformation , except the @xmath71 term ; the variation of this last term is interpreted as a change in @xmath4 under renormalization . fixing the other quadratic terms in the exponential yields @xmath82 and @xmath83 , with the dynamic exponent @xmath14 fixed at 2 by comparing the scaling of the @xmath84 and @xmath85 terms .",
    "the consistency of the mean field scaling is verified by ascertaining that all higher order operators are irrelevant ; this is indeed the case for @xmath86 , which is therefore the upper critical dimension .",
    "this upper critical dimension is the same as for @xmath87 .    at @xmath88 , the entire function @xmath89",
    "$ ] becomes marginal . for @xmath49 ,",
    "the critical behaviour is changed from its mean field form . as discussed in ref .",
    ", for @xmath49 the function @xmath61 splits up into a constant part @xmath90 that controls the static distortions in the phase , and a functional operator @xmath91 that controls the dynamics .",
    "the two of these decouple from each other , and scale differently . for the dynamics above threshold ,",
    "where the steady state solution is periodic , it is necessary to preserve the invariance under the transformation @xmath92 . for @xmath93 , the upper critical dimension , fluctuations in @xmath37 scale in the same way as @xmath94 ; this then requires @xmath52 to be invariant under rescaling , as discussed in ref .. the operator whose coefficient is the constant part of @xmath61 , @xmath90 , is then _ relevant _ , leading to anomalous scaling of the static correlations .    below threshold",

    "the static correlation length still exists , and was indirectly obtained in ref . as the length that controls the finite size scaling behaviour .",
    "the static correlation function above threshold varies as a simple power law with distance , and does _ not _ show any crossover at the static ( or dynamic ) correlation length , so that the static correlation length can not be obtained directly .",

    "previous simulations have often been carried out with the continuous variable dynamics of eq.([flr ] ) , with @xmath23 discretized to a lattice .",

    "this automaton model ( and variants of it ) are numerically much more efficient than direct simulations of eq.([flr ] ) .",

    "we can view this as a sandpile model@xcite if we treat @xmath118 as the height of sand at the site @xmath23 ; when this exceeds a preset threshold ( zero in eq.([sandpile ] ) ) one grain of sand falls off from @xmath23 to each of its neighbouring sites . as @xmath4 is increased , @xmath121 $ ] increases by 1 whenever its argument crosses an integer . from eq.([curvature ] ) , we see that increasing @xmath4 towards threshold is equivalent to dropping grains of sand randomly on different sites of the system .",
    "there is , however , a slight difference in the manner in which sand is added as compared to standard sandpile models : since the randomness from @xmath122 is _ quenched _ , sand grains are dropped in a random order on the different sites of the lattice one by one , with _ no _ site being revisited twice in a cycle . when every site has been visited exactly once , the whole cycle is repeated in the same order .",
    "in contrast to this , in standard sandpile models the addition of each sand grain is an independent random process , and there are no correlations between the sites chosen . for a sufficiently large system , where the repeating cycle is very long , it is reasonable to expect the difference between cyclic and uncorrelated addition of sand grains to be inconsequential.@xcite",
    "another difference between cdws and usual sandpiles is that open boundary conditions are normally used for sandpiles , whereas periodic boundary conditions are used for cdws . with periodic boundary conditions , a grain of sand that exits the system at one boundary reenters at the opposite boundary .",
    "again , when the system size is much larger than the characteristic avalanche size , this difference should not affect the behaviour .",

    "the collapse to a scaling form in the numerical data shown in figure 1 is not very good .",

    "although the analytical treatment of section iii is applicable only for continuous variable dynamics , a proper analysis of the singular part of the _ non - linear _ response to finite increases in @xmath4 might yield the automaton values for the exponent @xmath167 ; we have so far been unable to carry this out .",

    ". a proper understanding of this phenomenon is still lacking ; however , it is possible that considerations about the equilibrium behaviour ( at finite temperature ) in the _ absence _ of a driving force may be applicable here . at low temperatures",
    ", one might expect the presence of a driving force to produce an overall forward drift of the cdw , while still preserving the equilibrium properties locally . in equilibrium",
    ", the dynamics can be expressed in terms of correlations in the pinning potential .",
    "this is in contrast to our zero temperature analysis , where the physically relevant correlation function @xmath61 is related to force - force correlations.@xcite the potential - potential correlation function is related to the function @xmath61 integrated twice ; as shown in ref .",
    ", in equilibrium it is necessary for this to be periodic in its argument .",
    "changing @xmath61 by a constant @xmath90 is therefore no longer allowed in equilibrium . setting @xmath90 to zero implies that the static correlations no longer scale differently from the dynamic correlations , and @xmath194 .",
    "further work on this , especially on crossovers from equilibrium to nonequilibrium properties , is clearly required .",
    "most of the work on sandpile models has been on the properties at the critical point . however , tang and bak@xcite have considered sandpile models away from the critical point ; through a combination of scaling arguments and numerical simulations , they have obtained results similar to some of ours .",
    "for instance , by considering the diffusive nature by which sand grains propagate through the system , they obtain the exponent identity @xmath195 , which is the same as from eqs.([obtgamma ] ) and ( [ obtnu ] ) . with the assumption that the distribution of avalanches is independent of system size for sufficiently large systems , and the implicit assumption that the moment of an avalanche is proportional to its size , they obtain an exponent identity connecting @xmath8 and @xmath163 , which is a special case of the general result derived in the previous section .",
    "the first of these two assumptions is equivalent to @xmath181 not being singular ; we have seen in the previous section that this is correct , both by comparing our scaling law to that of majumdar and dhar@xcite and by direct numerical verification .",
    "the second assumption , that @xmath189 , is _ not _ correct , even though it is approximately valid for @xmath21 which is the case tang and bak focus on ( and actually much better for @xmath143 ) . a few other results that they obtain are for the behaviour of transients , and can not be compared with our work .",
    "the authors have also noted that if the critical behaviour in these nonequilibrium models were to be like that of equilibrium statistical mechanical systems , various exponent identities relating @xmath34 to other quantities would result .",
    "these exponent identities can be compared with our results , and are found _ not _ to be valid .    surprisingly , the value obtained by them for @xmath16 through numerical simulations is @xmath196 , which disagrees completely with our analytical and numerical result @xmath197 .",
    "it is not clear what this difference is due to , although a similar value of @xmath16 ( @xmath198 ) has apparently been observed in other simulations as well in which the sandpile is perturbed in a manner different from ours@xcite .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , with different types of kicks on the sandpile ( that may or may not have physically meaningful analogs in the continuous variable models ) @xmath16 can be very different ; this might be the source of the discrepancy .",
    "our simulations on sandpile models , detailed in the previous section , yield @xmath199 .    a related problem to cdws , that of the depinning of interfaces in random media , has been analyzed in the moving phase by methods similar to those used for cdws.@xcite unlike the case for cdws",
    ", the statics and dynamics do not behave differently ; physically , this is because as the interface moves forward it experiences different regions of impurities and is thus unable to build up anomalous static correlations .",
    "formally , this is seen by the absence of an unstable direction at the fixed point of @xmath61 when the appropriate boundary conditions are taken . since this separate scaling of static and dynamic correlations is the source of the difference between @xmath200 and @xmath201 for cdws , two - sided scaling will be valid for interfaces .",
    "the relation @xmath195 can be verified to be still true by the procedure in this paper .",
    "parisi and pietronero@xcite have considered a model for cdws which is equivalent to choosing the pinning potentials @xmath43 at different sites to be of the form @xmath202 , so that the phase at any site experiences a _ constant _ retarding force from the pinning potential , equal to @xmath203 .",
    "in addition to this , there is the elastic force from the neighbouring sites , and the external driving force .",
    "( although they have a @xmath204-function constraint that prevents the total force at any site from being negative , we have seen that when threshold is approached monotonically the phases at all the sites always move forward , so that this constraint is inconsequential for the critical behaviour . )",
    "although this model correctly yields @xmath205 and @xmath109 , the dynamic exponent @xmath14 is wrong , being trivially equal to 2 .",
    "the reason for this partially correct result can now be understood : after averaging over the randomness , their model corresponds to the one we have considered here , with the dynamic part of the correlation function , @xmath91 , set to zero , but with @xmath206 .",
    "this _ does _ constitute a fixed point , at which loop corrections from @xmath91 are absent , so that @xmath207 .",
    "however , this fixed point is unstable to the one that we have analyzed in this paper , so that the model that they have considered constitutes a pathological limit for pinning potentials . in particular",
    ", it is possible to replace the vertical drop in @xmath43 at @xmath208 with a very steep section of non - zero width .",
    "the critical behaviour of this model has been found numerically@xcite to the same as for the other models that we have considered here , although the width of the critical region above threshold can be seen through a perturbation expansion to vanish as the width of the steep sections grows smaller.@xcite    as mentioned in section iii , due to the restriction that the driving force must be monotonically increasing in time , it is not possible to obtain the ac response @xmath77 from our analysis .",
    "it is not clear at present if some variation of our approach may prove adequate for this purpose .",
    "it is important to remember that the universality that exists for various different models with regard to the monotonic approach to threshold is considerably limited for @xmath77 even in low dimensions .    in this paper , we have analyzed the critical behaviour of charge density waves as the depinning threshold is approached monotonically from below .",
    "our success in this was due to the fact that , for this special path to threshold , the existence of many metastable states was argued not to invalidate the perturbation expansion we carry out .",
    "although for any particular problem one must consider afresh whether such a perturbation expansion is valid , it may be possible to use similar techniques for other systems .",
