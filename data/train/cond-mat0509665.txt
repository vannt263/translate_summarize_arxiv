    "the concentration of a substance advected by a driving field such as a fluid flow often shows interesting behavior . in examples such as smoke dispersed in air or fluorescent dye carried by a turbulent jet ,",
    "an initial local concentration of the passive particles generally spreads out in space  @xcite .",
    "however , if the fluid is compressible , instead of spreading out , the advected substance may show a tendency to cluster , as with air bubbles in water or dust particles in air  @xcite .    in the situations discussed above , the advected substance has a negligible effect on the fluid flow .",
    "these problems are examples of ` passive scalar ' problems , where the dynamics of a non - equilibrium driving field strongly affects that of the other ( passive ) field with no back - effect from the latter . in this paper , we study clustering in a set of passive particles which are subjected to a fluctuating force field .",
    "the specific system we study consists of hard - core particles sliding under gravity on a one dimensional fluctuating interface ; the instantaneous force on a particle is then proportional to the local slope of the surface .",
    "interestingly , our results also pertain to particles advected by a fluid , using the fact that the equation governing a moving interface can be mapped onto the burgers equation , which describes a compressible fluid  @xcite .",
    "the degree of clustering of the particles depends strongly on the interactions between them .",
    "two cases have been studied earlier ",
    "particles which are completely non - interacting  @xcite and particles which interact via hard - core exclusion  @xcite .",
    "we study the latter , more realistic , case in this paper and address two broad issues , namely dynamics and ordering .",
    "the first issue concerns the time - dependent properties of the passive particles .",
    "we obtain results for the auto - correlation and space - time correlation functions in steady state , and aging correlations in the approach to steady state . to our knowledge",
    ", the dynamics of passive scalars has not been explored systematically , and our study adds to the relatively sparse work on this important question  @xcite .",
    "we have considered two kinds of surface evolutions namely those that respect symmetry under reflection ( edwards - wilkinson type ) and those which break this symmetry ( kardar - parisi - zhang type ) .",
    "our simulation results for the dynamics of the sliding particle system are supplemented by analytical calculations for a related model of coarse - grained interface variables .",
    "the second issue concerns the characterization of the steady state as an ordered state .",
    "earlier studies of static properties revealed that strong fluctuations are present in the steady state and do not decrease even in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the scaling function for the density correlation indicates that the system has long range order .",
    "this sort of fluctuation dominated phase ordering ( fdpo ) is characterized by a broad distribution of the order parameter .",
    "the question then arises : in what sense does fdpo represent an ordered state , if strong fluctuations drive it between macroscopically different configurations on a relatively rapid time - scale ? we address this by studying the variation of the length of the largest particle cluster present in the system and show that the corresponding probability distribution provides an unequivocal signal of ordering .",

    "the scaling function has a finite intercept @xmath36 , and for small argument it decays with a cusp : @xmath37 @xmath36 is a measure of long range order ( lro ) as lro is defined by the large @xmath5 ( scaling limit ) behavior of the correlation function . in the limit of an infinite system",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath38 .",

    ", the correlation function was shown analytically to have the above scaling form with @xmath43 and @xmath44 for both ew and kpz surfaces .",
    "for hard - core particles sliding on a two dimensional surface , the same scaling form is found for @xmath33 , but with a different value of the intercept and the cusp exponent .",
    "for customary phase - ordering systems , it is expected that this scaling function should decay linearly , consistent with the porod law  @xcite .",
    "the cusp ( @xmath45 ) is one manifestation of the unusual nature of fdpo .    for a phase - ordered system ,",
    "the lowest non - zero fourier component of the density profile measures the extent of phase - separation and is an appropriate order parameter .",
    "a characteristic of fdpo is that the distribution of this order parameter remains broad even in the thermodynamic limit , indicating the presence of strong fluctuations .      in this paper",
    ", we study the dynamics associated with fdpo .",
    "our results are summarized below .",
    "we find that the steady state auto - correlation in the density fluctuation @xmath46 of the sliding particles ( sp ) : @xmath47 is a scaling function of @xmath0 , consistent with the notion of phase ordering .",
    "for @xmath48 , this scaling function decays with a cusp , in contrast to a linear decay normally expected for phase - ordering systems .",
    "the presence of the cusp is the dynamical manifestation of the unconventional character of fdpo .",
    "we also monitored the auto - correlation function in the aging regime @xmath49 . from the dynamic scaling hypothesis",
    ", @xmath50 should be a scaling function of @xmath51 , the ratio of initial time to the time lag  @xcite . in the limit @xmath52",
    ", the scaling function shows a power law decay with an exponent that depends on the phase - ordering kinetics . in the opposite limit @xmath53",
    ", the scaling function decays with a cusp as in steady state , the only difference being that the system size @xmath1 , as appears in the steady state scaling function , is replaced by the coarsening length @xmath54 .",
    "the space - time correlation for the sliding particles in steady state , defined as @xmath55 is a function of @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "when plotted against @xmath0 for a fixed value of @xmath3 , this function is non - monotonic . and decays like the steady state auto - correlation for large @xmath4 .",
    "the auto - correlation function in steady state and in the aging regime , together with the space - time correlation function in steady state constitute our dynamical characterization of fdpo .",
    "the distinctive feature of fdpo is the presence of strong fluctuations in steady state . on the one hand , a diagnostic of lro such as a non - zero value of the intercept @xmath36 indicates an ordered state . on the other hand",
    ", the macroscopic state of the system changes relatively rapidly over a time - scale @xmath56 , in contrast to a normal phase - ordered system , where the typical time grows exponentially with @xmath1 .",
    "the small lifetime of a given macroscopic ordered state gives pause , and seems to contradict the notion of lro . to resolve this apparent contradiction we study the time dependence of the length of the largest particle cluster @xmath57 .",
    "we conclude that the short lifetime is associated with the system wandering over a multitude of ordered states , each very different from the other , but all characterized by a large value of @xmath58 .",
    "dynamical excursions away from this attractor of ordered states are extremely infrequent and associated with an exponentially growing time scale .",
    "we study a discrete model of a fluctuating interface on which hard - core particles slide downwards under gravity , following the local slope of the interface .",
    "the @xmath59-d interface of length @xmath1 , consists of discrete surface elements ; the slope of the surface elements between the @xmath60-th and @xmath61-th site is @xmath62 , which can take the value @xmath63 or @xmath64 . accordingly",
    "the height at site @xmath60 is given by @xmath65 .",
    "the dynamics of the interface involves stochastic corner flips with exchange of adjacent @xmath66 s ; the transition @xmath67 to @xmath68 occurs with a rate @xmath69 while @xmath68 to @xmath67 with rate @xmath70 .",
    "we have taken @xmath71 for an ew surface and @xmath72 , @xmath73 for kpz surface .",
    "the overall slope @xmath74 is conserved and in our case we will consider @xmath75 , meaning that the interface is untilted .",
    "the hard - core particles are represented by variables @xmath76 each of which takes a value @xmath63 or @xmath64 according as the @xmath60-th site contains a particle or a hole .",
    "the deviation from half - filling @xmath77 is conserved and we consider @xmath78 , corresponding to the case of half - filling . a particle and hole on adjacent sites @xmath79 exchange with rates that depend on the intervening local slope @xmath62 ; thus the moves @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xmath81 @xmath84 occurs at rate @xmath85 while the inverse moves occur at rate @xmath86 . in the case when the particles are sliding downwards along gravity , we have @xmath87 .",
    "we have considered @xmath88 and @xmath89 . because of the hard - core exclusion between the particles , with the above update rules , the system has a particle - hole symmetry , i.e. any correlation function involving the density variable remains invariant as the particle density is replaced by the hole density .",
    "this implies that unlike the case of non - interacting particles where the correlation function of the density variable is qualitatively different between the advection case and the anti - advection case  @xcite , the two processes show identical correlation behavior here .    from the dynamical rules",
    ", it follows that the movement of particles depends on the fluctuations of the underlying interface . due to gravity",
    "the particles tend to slide down into local valleys .",
    "however , in the non - equilibrium system under consideration , before the particles can fill in the lowest valley , the interface evolves , often causing the valley to turn over . nevertheless , it is useful to consider the adiabatic limit where the interface moves infinitely more slowly than the particles , in which case the particles have ample time to explore the landscape and eventually settle in the deepest valleys .",
    "it seems plausible that the dynamics of hills and valleys of the interface may provide insight into the dynamics of the particles .",
    "this motivates the definition of a coarse - grained depth model ( cd model ) as follows  @xcite .",
    "consider the variable @xmath90 defined as @xmath91 $ ] , where @xmath92 is the average height at time @xmath4 : @xmath93 .",
    "the variable @xmath90 can take values @xmath63,@xmath64 or @xmath94 , depending on whether the position of the @xmath60-th site is above , below or at the average level .",
    "in other words , @xmath90 gives a coarse - grained description of the surface by labeling ` highlands ' and ` lowlands ' .",
    "for an ew interface , the dynamics is tractable and we obtain an analytic expression for time - dependent correlations of @xmath90 . these results might be expected to be close to those of @xmath95 in the extreme adiabatic limit . as a matter of fact , we find that they also describe qualitatively the particle model even in the strongly non - equilibrium case .",
    "we have studied the auto - correlation @xmath96 involving the density variable @xmath97 in the sliding particle ( sp ) model and also that for the cd variables @xmath98 in the cd model .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "we will see below that in the steady state of a system of size @xmath1 , the auto - correlation @xmath96 is a scaling function of @xmath99 , where @xmath2 is the dynamic exponent defined earlier .",
    "this scaling function shows a cusp in the small argument limit , as seen previously in the static correlation scaling function [ eq . ( [ eq : alpha ] ) ] : @xmath100 , \\ ; \\ ; \\ ;   \\frac{t}{l^z } \\rightarrow 0    \\label{eq : beta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath101 is a measure of the lro as explained in section 2 .",
    "note that for large enough time , the auto - correlation function is expected to factorize and become equal to @xmath36 .",
    "however , for small time , @xmath102 , which falls outside the scaling regime , the auto - correlation function shows a linear drop with an @xmath1-dependent slope : @xmath103 if @xmath43 , as shown below for the cd model , matching eqs.([eq : beta ] ) and ( [ eq : lambda ] ) for @xmath104 yields @xmath105 if @xmath106 , as happens for the sp model , a relation between the exponents can not be obtained .",
    "instead , the matching condition determines a time scale @xmath107 for the crossover from the linear decay in eq.([eq : lambda ] ) to the cuspy decay in eq.([eq : beta ] ) . in the large @xmath1 limit",
    ", we find to the leading order , @xmath108    ._the values of relevant exponents and order parameter for dynamical characterization of cd model and sp model _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     let us illustrate these properties , by discussing the auto - correlation in the cd model , defined as @xmath109 . first consider short times @xmath102 . at @xmath110 let the initial configuration of the surface be @xmath111 .",
    "as time passes , there are stochastic corner flips , as described in section @xmath42 .",
    "however , only those flips occurring close to the average level can cause a change in the cd variable @xmath112 , as any local fluctuation far above or below the average level , would not change the sign of @xmath113 .",
    "more precisely , only those sites in @xmath111 which have at least one neighbor situated exactly on the average level , putatively contribute to the drop in auto - correlation function .",

    "the results are shown in fig.(4a ) where we have also included the scaling function @xmath214 to compare the long time behavior .",
    "the corresponding results for kpz surface are shown in fig.(4b ) .",
    "one of the key characteristics of fdpo is the presence of strong fluctuations , even in the thermodynamic limit . in the steady state ,",
    "large clusters are present in the system and the cluster size distribution follows a power law . as a result of fluctuations ,",
    "these clusters undergo large changes in their lengths , associated with the fact that the macroscopic state of the system keeps changing . for a system of size @xmath1 ,",
    "the typical lifetime of a macrostate scales as @xmath154 .",
    "the question arises : if the lifetime of a state is so much smaller than exponential , in what sense can we call such a state a ` phase ' ?",
    "we have addressed this question in the following way .",
    "let @xmath230 be the length of the largest cluster present in the system at time @xmath4 .",
    "in a disordered state , this length scales as @xmath231 . but",
    "starting from a random initial configuration , as the system approaches steady state , @xmath230 , although a fluctuating quantity , shows an increasing trend . finally ,",
    "in steady state , @xmath230 is still fluctuating , thereby changing the macroscopic state of the system .",
    "but @xmath230 continues to remain substantially above its disordered state value @xmath231 . in other words ,",
    "the system manages to retain its ordered character despite steady state fluctuations .",
    "the system continues to move from one macroscopic state to other over a time - scale of @xmath154 .",
    "but each of these states are ordered in the sense that they all correspond to large values of @xmath230 .",
    "we have studied the distribution of @xmath232 in steady state as well as in disordered state .",
    "our studies show that as system size increases , the overlap between these two distributions falls off .",
    "this means that as @xmath1 grows , it is increasingly unlikely for the steady state @xmath232 to come down as low as its disordered state value .",
    "the time - scale for such a transition in fact grows exponentially with @xmath1 .",
    "the disordered state distribution was obtained by averaging over @xmath233 data points .",
    "the mean of this distribution scales as @xmath231 as mentioned earlier .",
    "after the system has reached steady state , we measure the largest cluster present in that configuration .",
    "we let the configuration evolve in time and after waiting for few hundred time steps , we again measure @xmath230 .",
    "we obtain the distribution @xmath234 after normalizing over @xmath235 such data points . as shown in the following figures , @xmath234 for different @xmath1 values undergo a scaling collapse as @xmath232 is rescaled by the mean of the distribution @xmath236 . we have found that @xmath237 , where the exponent @xmath238 depends on the dynamical rules . for particles on an ew surface @xmath239 , whereas for kpz advection , @xmath240 while for kpz anti - advection @xmath241 .",
    "we show the data for kpz advection in fig.([fig : pkplarg ] ) .",
    "[ h ]   for particles advected by kpz surface is shown for @xmath242 , with the scaling collapse in the inset.the curves to the left show the same distribution in disordered state , after rescaling the y - axis by @xmath243__,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "in this paper , we have studied the dynamics of interacting passive scalars driven by a fluctuating edwards - wilkinson or kardar - parisi - zhang surface ( or equivalently , a burgers fluid ) , by characterizing the scaling properties of correlation functions in steady state and those of aging correlations during the approach to steady state .",
    "it is instructive to compare our results with earlier work on the dynamics of passive scalars in different contexts .",
    "mitra and pandit  @xcite studied the dynamical properties of a system of non - interacting passive particles , advected by an incompressible fluid , whose velocity field is drawn from the kraichnan ensemble , and therefore has power law correlations in space , but is delta - correlated in time . by contrast",
    ", we have studied passive particles with hard - core interactions , advected ( in the burgers case ) by a compressible flow which has power law correlations in time .",
    "the compressible nature of the flow results in particles being driven together in our case .",
    "the resulting state is described by a space - time correlation function @xmath202 which is a function of the scaling combinations @xmath3 and @xmath0 , as in any phase - ordering system . however , there is no non - trivial @xmath244 scaling in the limit @xmath35 . on the contrary , in  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath202 was found to show a scaling between @xmath5 and @xmath4 , with @xmath245 for fixed @xmath1 .",
    "this difference of behavior is presumably a reflection of the strong differences between passive scalars with clustering or phase - ordering tendencies , and those which spread out in space .",
    "even when the driving fluid is compressible , the degree of clustering of the passive particles depends on the nature of interactions between them . in the presence of hard - core interactions , the system reaches a phase - ordered state , albeit one with strong fluctuations . as a consequence , in the limit of small scaling argument , the spatial and temporal correlation functions show a cuspy approach to a finite intercept .",
    "however , in the absence of any interaction , the passive particles go into a more strongly clustered state , where the correlation functions show a power law divergence at the origin  @xcite .",
    "finally , the study of the largest cluster allows us to arrive at a simple picture of a fluctuation dominated phase - ordered state . despite the presence of strong fluctuations , the system never loses its ordered character .",
    "fluctuations carry the system from one ordered configuration to another macroscopically distinct one , over a time - scale @xmath56 . however , the probability for the system to leave this attractor of ordered states vanishes exponentially with the system size .",
