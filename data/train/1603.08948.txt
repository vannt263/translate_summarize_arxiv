    "quantum walk ( qw ) is a quantum mechanical version of classical random walk , whose time evolution of qws are defined by unitary evolutions of probability amplitudes . for its characteristic properties ,",
    "qw has attracted much interest of various fields in the quantum scale , such as quantum algorithms @xcite and quantum physics @xcite .",
    "many reviews and books on qws have been published so far @xcite .",
    "owing to the wealth applications , it is beneficial to study qws both theoretically and experimentally . in recent years , qws have also been implemented experimentally by several kinds of materials , such as trapped ions @xcite and photons @xcite .",
    "however , because of its difficulties for qws to implement the state after many steps , we have not succeeded to see experimentally the behavior in the long time - limit .",
    "in addition , for the quantum nature , it is hard for us to intuitively assimilate the properties .",
    "+ recently , to derive measures from qws has become one of the hottest topics in the theoretical study of qws @xcite . especially , the properties of the stationary measures of the two - state qws in one dimension have been gradually studied in the immediate past @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the stationary measure of the markov chain has been deeply studied , however , the fruits of study for qw has not yet been given .",
    "this is one of the motivations of our study . in this paper , we focus on the 2-state and 3-state qws in one dimension whose time evolutions are generally expressed by a diagonal unitary matrix or diagonal unitary matrices with one defect .",
    "+ now we explain concisely the previous studies of stationary measures . in @xmath1 ,",
    "konno et al .",
    "@xcite gave a stationary measure of the qw with one defect whose quantum coin has a phase at @xmath2 , and konno @xcite gave the uniform measure as a stationary measure of the one - dimensional qws in one dimension .",
    "then endo et al .",
    "@xcite got a stationary measure of the qw with one defect whose quantum coins are defined by the hadamard matrix at @xmath3 and the rotation matrix at @xmath2 .",
    "endo and konno @xcite derived a stationary measure of `` the wojcik model '' in @xmath4 , and then endo et al .",
    "@xcite obtained a stationary measure of the two - phase qw .",
    "konno and takei @xcite showed that the set of the stationary measures of the qw except @xmath5 is diagonal , contains non - uniform stationary measure and they showed that any stationary measure is uniform for diagonal matrices .",
    "moreover , they proved that the set of the stationary measures contains uniform measure for the qw in general .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give a description of @xmath6-state discrete - time qw ( dtqw ) in one dimension .",
    "we consider the stationary measures of the 2-state diagonal qw with one defect in section [ onedefectqw ] , and then , we study 3-state case in section [ 3state-1defect ] .",
    "as a quantum version of classical random walk with discrete - time , discrete - time qw ( dtqw ) has been intensively studied since the beginning of 2000. in this section , we explain briefly how the @xmath6-state dtqw is generally described , where @xmath7 .",
    "the total space is defined by a hilbert space @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is spanned by @xmath11 , called a position hilbert space , and @xmath12 is a coin hilbert space , spanned by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the set of integers . the time evolution of the walk is described by a set of @xmath15 unitary matrices @xmath16 on @xmath12 , where @xmath17 which is called _ the quantum coin_. note that the subscript @xmath18 represents the position of the walker . to define the time evolution ,",

    "the walker at time @xmath32 and position @xmath33 has a coin state expressed by the @xmath6-dimensional vector ; @xmath34\\in\\mathbb{c}^{n}\\ ] ] and the time evolution is determined by the recurrence formula :    * if @xmath6 is odd , we have @xmath35 * if @xmath6 is even , we have @xmath36    now let @xmath37\\in(\\mathbb{c}^{n})^{\\mathbb{z}}\\ ] ] and @xmath38 where @xmath39 means the transposed operation and @xmath40 is the standard shift operator : @xmath41    the @xmath42 unitary matrix @xmath43 is a time evolution operator on @xmath8 , that is , the state of the walker at position @xmath33 and time @xmath32 can be defined by @xmath44 .",
