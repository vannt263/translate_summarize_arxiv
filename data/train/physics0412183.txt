    "to demonstrate this anomaly , we discuss a transparent `` membrane capacitor '' model , which exhibits a @xmath3  domain presuming uniformity while becoming unstable in this domain if non - uniform surface charge distributions and membrane deformations are considered .",

    "mathematically , charge transfer is controlled by the term @xmath161relating the thermodynamic potentials of the open and isolated capacitor ( eq . [ expand_isolate ] ) .",

    "our results indicate that  adding another relaxation mechanism immediately leads to the appearance of a @xmath237  domain and instability .",
    "this and our earlier discussion of the electronic models illustrates that anomalies are more typical than expected based on purely ionic models  with immobile  charged plates . *  *    in previous analysis @xcite we considered two elastically coupled membrane capacitors , with the extra term in the deformational energy @xmath238 * *  * * accounting * *  * * for the non - uniformity penalty ( differential thinning of the patches ) . depending on the coupling constant @xmath239",

    "our present discussion implies such a picture is unrealistic . in terms of the first model",

    "in addition , as shown in the second example , the non - uniformity contributions become insignificant at small @xmath205  which provides a reasonable pathway * *  * * for the onset of instability .",
    "finally , we reiterate the major difference between @xmath4-  and @xmath6-control for the onset of instability . under @xmath6-control ( an open system connected to a potentiostat ) stability",
    "is lost simultaneously for both uniform deformation and undulations @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a @xmath4-controlled ( isolated ) system is always stable with respect to uniform deformation ( see eq . [ q_stab ] and the corresponding discussion ) and only loses stability in transiting to a nonuniform state .",
    "an important consequence is that in a @xmath6-driven transition the original and final phases correspond to different values of @xmath4  while under @xmath4-control only the local charge density can change provided its average value is fixed .",
    "it is by now well established that the capacitance can be negative for uniformly charged surfaces under the artificial conditions of @xmath2-control .",
    "many statistical ionic models have demonstrated this anomaly ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "while in the 1980s many would have viewed such predictions as model faults , the most recent view @xcite represents a dramatic change of mind , and it is even suggested that the prediction of @xmath3 must be considered as a criterion validating an ionic model @xcite rather than an imperfection .",
    "we do not disagree .",
    "in fact , it accords with our observation @xcite that such predictions are typical of models jointly accounting for various contributions ( electronic , ionic , etc . ) to the charging induced relaxation of the effective gap of the interfacial capacitor .     what is the physical significance of such predictions ?",
    "our analysis indicates that they imply an instability with respect to a transition to an inhomogeneous state . to analyze the consequences , the artificial assumption of a uniform surface charge distribution",
    "must be dropped , given that in a real metallic electrodes the electrons are free to move and thus surface charge density can become , at least in principle , laterally non - uniform .",
    "this non - uniformity can be even more pronounced in soft media such as lipid bilayers .",
    "the value of the models predicting this anomaly , emphasized in @xcite , is even greater since they are candidates for analyzing such instability .",
    "we must re - emphasize that in our usage the terms `` instability '' and `` transition '' are not related to real interfacial critical phenomena . while the phase transition actually occurs before @xmath75  becomes negative , we permit the system to enter this domain by artificially maintaining @xmath2-control . relaxing the uniformity constraint at any @xmath1  within the @xmath3 * *  * * domain leads immediately to a transition to an inhomogeneous state of fixed @xmath4 , @xmath240  although the initial ( @xmath1-controlled ) state is artificial , the final stable inhomogeneous phase ( if it exists ) is real since the equilibrium state is unique .",
    "thus , our approach is useful for testing and developing statistical models that describe both uniform ( @xmath241and inhomogeneous ( regions with @xmath242  under @xmath1-control )  phases .",
    "predicting instability does not necessarily imply that the model describes the formation of a new stable inhomogeneous phase . as the transition can be accompanied by a substantial local increase of the charge density and a corresponding local increase of the ionic density in the edl",
    ", a model must have a stabilization mechanism that interrupts the * *  * * propagation of instability .",
    "this would permit formation of new stable phase before the condition of `` ideal polarizability '' is broken and interfacial charge transfer occurs .",
    "ionic size and correlation effects in the electrolyte must be important here .",
    "although the condition @xmath3 , obtained for a primitive ionic model of the edl , can be an important factor leading to instability , it is not a necessary condition .",
    "even with ionic models that by themselves do not lead to instability ( such as gcs model ) the addition of other mechanisms of relaxation , such as a displacement of the `` electronic plate '' of the interfacial capacitor , can lead to @xmath237 and thus trigger the instability @xcite .",
    "in other words , this anomaly should be even more commonplace than is implied by ionic model studies .",
    "another important question is a comparison of phase transitions predicted for the open and the isolated systems .",
    "while in the first case the transition can be accompanied by charging the electrodes , in the second case the lateral variation of charge keeps the total charge fixed .",
    "finally , the inherent inhomogeneity ( roughness ) of an electrode surface ( especially with respect to solid electrodes ) must be considered .",
    "the influence of the roughness on the equilibrium properties of edl is well established @xcite , and its possible effect on the surface phase transition can also be a promising field for further research .",
