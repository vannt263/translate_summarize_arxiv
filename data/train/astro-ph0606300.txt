    "the 6.7  ghz methanol maser is a strong tracer of high - mass star - formation @xcite and is typically one of the brightest masers in those regions .",
    "the masers occur in regions with similar densities and temperatures to the ground state oh masers , where enhanced densities of both molecular species are to be expected as a result of material from grain mantles being evaporated under the influence of weak shocks @xcite .",
    "theoretical modelling has shown that both masers can be pumped simultaneously @xcite .",
    "similar to h@xmath2o , methanol is a non - paramagnetic molecule . as a result ,",
    "the zeeman splitting is only a small fraction of the typical maser line width .",
    "thus , the determination of the magnetic field strength using 6.7  ghz methanol masers requires sensitive and high spectral resolution observations . as yet , no successful methanol zeeman experiment has been reported .",
    "only recently have the first measurements of linear polarization of the 6.7  ghz methanol maser been made .",
    "observations by @xcite indicate a fractional linear polarization up to @xmath3  per  cent , although no polarization maps have been produced until now .    in this letter the polarization properties of the 6.7  ghz methanol masers in the massive star - forming region w3(oh )",
    "are presented .",

    "strong oh and methanol masers are seen projected onto the uchii region and strong h@xmath2o masers have been found towards the related turner - welch ( tw ) object @xcite .",
    "the 6.7  ghz methanol masers of the uchii region w3(oh ) were observed on december 10 - 11 in 2004 using merlin .",
    "a 500  khz bandwidth with 512 spectral channels was used , centered at @xmath5  km  s@xmath6 , resulting in a velocity resolution of 0.044  km  s@xmath6  and a total velocity coverage of 22.5  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the observations have been discussed in detail in hsc06 .",
    "the initial calibration steps were as described in hsc06 , but a separate calibration for optimal polarization measurements was carried out .",
    "instrumental feed polarization was determined using the aips task pcal .",
    "after correction for the r - l phase offset , self - calibration was performed on a strong , isolated maser feature using only the right circular polarization .",
    "the calibration results were then applied to both polarizations .",
    "3c286 was used to calibrate the polarization angle .",
    "finally , image cubes were created in stokes i , q , u and v , as well as in right and left circular polarization ( rhc and lhc ) , by mapping with a circular restoring beam of 50  mas .",
    "since the self - calibration for the polarization experiment was performed on the rhc data alone , not all the flux found in hsc06 was recovered and the rms noise level is somewhat increased .",

    "is characterised by masers with a broad line profile , the region will be called the broadline region , in correspondence with the terminology used in hsc06 .",

    "a map of the strongest 6.7  ghz maser features together with their polarization angles is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] .",
    "we also produced a circular polarization @xmath44 image cube .",
    "however , both because of dynamical range effects and heavy spectral blending of the various maser features we were unable to detect any significant circular polarization above a level of @xmath45  per  cent .",
    "@xcite describe a cross - correlation method to determine zeeman splitting , which is specifically suited for blended maser line of non - paramagnetic maser species , assuming the magnetic field is mostly constant across the spectrum .",
    "this method has been used to determine the upper limit of the magnetic field strength from the 22  ghz h@xmath2o maser polarization spectra of ngc  4258 , and it was shown that the uncertainty of the method , which uses rhc and lhc polarization spectra , is similar to that of the standard method using circular polarization measurements .",
    "we thus produced separate image cubes in rhc and lhc polarizations and determined the rhc and lhc polarized spectra of the brightest maser features .",
    "unfortunately , we were still limited by the dynamic range in the rhc and lhc polarization spectra and were only able to determine an upper limit to the zeeman splitting on the brightest maser features of the broadline region . this upper limit to the zeeman splitting of the 6.7  ghz methanol masers of w3(oh ) is @xmath46  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the fractional linear polarization of the 6.7  ghz methanol masers is comparable to that found in the southern star - forming region , ngc6334f , by @xcite . for the masers in w3(oh ) , the error weighted median @xmath47  per  cent , while the maximum linear polarization fraction is @xmath48  per  cent . from a small sample of methanol maser sources , @xcite has concluded that polarization of 6.7  ghz maser is more widespread than of 12.2  ghz methanol maser , consistent with 6.7  ghz masers being more saturated .",
    "however , @xcite has also found that the polarization characteristics of both methanol maser transitions in ngc6334f are strikingly similar when comparing 6.7  ghz observations with observations at 12.2  ghz by @xcite .",
    "polarization of the 12.2  ghz methanol masers in w3(oh ) has also been observed by @xcite , who find a linear polarization of @xmath49  per  cent .",
    "thus from our observations , we conclude that also for the methanol masers in w3(oh ) , where the 12.2  ghz maser velocity range overlaps exactly with the 6.7  ghz maser velocity range , the polarization characteristics of both transitions are very similar .",
    "we have for the first time mapped the linear polarization of 6.7  ghz methanol masers . we find that , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] , the polarization angles in w3(oh ) are similar across the entire maser region with the exception of those in part of the broadline region .",
    "the error weighted median of the polarization @xmath50 .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fig : spec ] , the broadline region displays a smooth but considerable polarization angle gradient .",
    "high spatial resolution very long baseline array ( vlba ) polarization observations have been made of the 13.44  ghz oh masers that are located within the broadline methanol maser region .",
    "these indicate that there is also a significant spread in the polarization angles of those masers ( diamond et al . , in preparation ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] we have also indicated the polarization vectors of the ground - state oh masers at 1.6  ghz from the electronic tables of @xcite , for which linear polarization has been detected at more than a @xmath51 level .",
    "the oh maser polarization angles show a wider spread , with the median polarization angle @xmath52 , which , for the 1.6  ghz oh masers , has been attributed to faraday rotation along the maser path ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "faraday rotation can be described by : @xmath53 } = 4.17\\times10 ^ 6~d{\\rm [ kpc]}~n_e{\\rm [ cm^{-3}]}~b_{\\rm ||}{\\rm [ mg]}~\\nu^{-2}{\\rm [ ghz]},\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the length of the path over which the faraday rotation occurs , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are respectively the average electron density and magnetic field along this path and @xmath57 is the frequency .",
    "if the faraday rotation is significant ( @xmath58  rad ) along the maser amplification path , but not too large ( @xmath59  rad ) along a single gain length ( typically @xmath60th of the amplification path ) , the faraday rotation will not completely inhibit the linear polarization , but will still cause a significant spread of polarization angles for different maser features . since faraday rotation scales with @xmath61 , the higher frequency methanol masers are mostly unaffected by internal faraday rotation , as is illustrated by the difference in the spread of the polarization angles of the oh and methanol masers .",
    "in addition to the internal faraday rotation , external faraday rotation makes the relationship between the polarization angle and magnetic field direction uncertain for the lower frequency observations .",
    "furthemore , it makes a direct comparison between the 1.6  ghz oh maser and the 6.7  ghz methanol maser polarization angles difficult . for typical values of the interstellar electron density @xmath62",
    "@xmath63 and magnetic field @xmath64 g , and assuming a distance to w3(oh ) of @xmath65  kpc , the faraday rotation at 6.7  ghz is @xmath66 .",
    "the faraday rotation at 1.6  ghz on the other hand is @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the difference between the median polarization angles at 6.7  ghz and 1.6  ghz , @xmath68 , is probably solely caused by external faraday rotation .",
    "an additional complication in determining the direction of the magnetic field from the linear polarization observations is the @xmath69 ambiguity in the relationship between the polarization angle and the magnetic field direction @xcite . as the linear polarization of the oh masers probably arises from the elliptical polarization of the @xmath70-components , the polarization angle of the oh masers is perpendicular to the magnetic field",
    "thus , since the difference in polarization angle between the 1.6  ghz oh masers and the 6.7  ghz methanol masers can be fully explained by external faraday rotation , it would appear that the 6.7  ghz polarization angles are also perpendicular to the magnetic field . correcting the methanol maser polarization angles for the external faraday rotation yields a position angle of @xmath71@xmath72 for the magnetic field in the methanol maser structure of w3(oh ) , which is nearly parallel to the extended 1.6 arcsecond long n - s maser filament , described in hsc06 .",
    "this is consistent with the model by @xcite , in which linear methanol sources trace planar shocks propagating nearly perpendicular to the line - of - sight .",
    "according to this model the magnetic field should be parallel to the elongated ( shock ) structure .",
    "the methanol molecule is a non - paramagnetic molecule and as a result the zeeman splitting under the influence of a magnetic field is extremely small .",
    "the split energy , @xmath73 , of an energy level under the influence of a magnetic field , @xmath74 , can be described as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 denotes the magnetic quantum number for the rotational transition described with the rotational quantum number @xmath77 , @xmath74 is the magnetic field strength in gauss , @xmath78 is the nuclear magneton and @xmath79 is the land @xmath79-factor .",
    "the zeeman effect is determined by the land @xmath79-factor , which for methanol has been investigated many years ago by @xcite , who found empirically that it is probably an average of the true @xmath79-factor of several interacting states and can be described by the equation:- @xmath80.\\ ] ]    for the @xmath81  a@xmath82 6.7  ghz methanol transition we find that the zeeman splitting is @xmath83 } = 0.049 b{\\rm    [ g]}$ ] .",
    "thus , we can place an upper limit to the magnetic field in the 6.7  ghz methanol broadline maser region in w3(oh ) of @xmath84  mg .",
    "this is consistent with the magnetic field strength of @xmath85@xmath86  mg found using the ground - state oh masers at 1612 , 1665 and 1667  mhz ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , noting that the ground - state and 6.8  ghz methanol masers are excited under similar physical conditions .",
    "it is also consistent with the magnetic field of @xmath7  mg found from the 6  ghz oh masers @xcite and the magnetic field of @xmath87  mg found from the 13.44  ghz oh masers @xcite , both of which were detected in the broadline region , coincident with the 6.7  ghz methanol masers .",
    "merlin has been used to produce the first maps of the polarization of 6.7  ghz methanol masers in the star - forming region w3(oh ) .",
    "linear polarization of up to @xmath0  per  cent , similar in level to that found from the 12.2  ghz methanol masers at the same velocities , has been found .",
    "we determined an upper limit of @xmath84  mg to the magnetic field strength through the rhc - lhc cross - correlation method . as the 6.7  ghz",
    "methanol masers are much less affected by internal and external faraday rotation than the lower frequency oh masers , they are excellent probes of the magnetic field direction in the maser region . after correction for faraday rotation",
    "we find that the magnetic field is orientated parallel to the extended n - s filamentary structure detected in methanol and oh maser observations .",
