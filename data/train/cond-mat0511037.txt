    "there are experimental and theoretical studies suggesting that certain far from equilibrium systems with many degrees of freedom naturally organize in a critical state , releasing energy through rapid relaxation events ( avalanches ) of different sizes , these sizes being distributed according to a power law probability density .",
    "examples of such behavior are found in earthquakes @xcite , biological systems @xcite , the stock market @xcite , rainfall @xcite , and friction @xcite .",
    "all these phenomena share the features of the prototypical sand pile model @xcite for which the concepts of self - organized criticality ( soc ) were first proposed .",
    "recently , the possibility of soc @xcite in systems presenting stick - slip due to dry friction has been under scrutiny @xcite . in particular ,",
    "slanina @xcite presented theoretical attempts to explain dry friction in terms of soc .",
    "however , the central question remains unanswered : to what extent is dry friction stick - slip a manifestation of soc ?",
    "the clarification of this issue has practical as well as fundamental implications . from the practical point of view",
    ", the power law exponents could be used as parameters to characterize friction and wear of surfaces . from the fundamental point of view , there is a growing interest to understand systems driven far away from equilibrium from a single unifying principle .",
    "in addition , there is not yet a full understanding of the dissipation mechanisms in friction .",
    "particularly , an overall description of the topography of the interface would be useful .    in the present study , we first present",
    "experimental results on stick slip in dry friction using a pin - on - disc arrangement , set to measure lateral forces .",
    "the probability distributions of force jumps sizes and the corresponding frequency power spectra for aluminum and steel are examined for evidence of soc .",
    "second , we present a theoretical explanation of the observed power laws based on the robin hood model @xcite , which has been successfully used in the past to study dislocation motion and friction .",
    "the pin - on - disk tribometer used for these experiments is shown in fig .",
    "[ x1 ] . this configuration was chosen because it allows for easy replacement of the contacting surfaces , and it is the standard method for measuring friction and wear in unlubricated and lubricated contacts .",
    "the apparatus uses a @xmath5 cm diameter disk and a spherical pin with a @xmath6 cm radius machined on its end .",
    "the pin is attached to a load arm that is mounted on a gimbal supported at the center through which a load applied at the end of the arm is transferred to the contact zone .",
    "a strain - gauge is mounted at the end of the arm to monitor tangential friction force .",
    "the tangential force is monitored at a sample rate of 1,000 scans / sec and conversion is done using a 16-bit data acquisition card controlled by labview .",
    "data is recorded to a text file for later analysis .",
    "frictional force measurements are done on matching aluminum and steel ( m50 ) pin - and - disc tribometers .",
    "the signal is collected at 1khz during 16min , thus collecting @xmath7 points .",
    "the first quarter of each data set , or about 4 minutes , is discarded to assure that steady state is reached . in order to drive the system very slowly away from static equilibrium , we select slow rotational speeds in the range 10 - 20 rpm . each disk is used for up to four tests by changing the radial position of the pin on the disk .",
    "loads for aluminum range from 250 g to 1000 g. steel is studied with a 1000 g normal load between pin and disk .",
    "figure  [ x2 ] shows a typical tangential friction force time series .",
    "it shows force jumps of various sizes .",
    "we first construct the probability distribution of force jumps .",
    "force jumps are taken as those events corresponding to negative changes in the tangential force .",
    "we next obtain the probability distributions of the tangential friction forces corresponding to aluminum under various loads and m50 steel .",
    "results of such analysis are presented in figs .",
    "[ x3 ] through [ x6 ] .",
    "we observe an approximate linear behavior on the double logarithmic plots suggesting the power law behavior of the distributions @xmath8 with the exponents @xmath0 in the range between 2.2 and 5.4 .",
    "we also compute the power spectra of the tangential friction force time series .",
    "we divide the original data ( @xmath9 ) into @xmath10 statistically independent non - overlapping data sets of @xmath11 points each .",
    "next , we calculate @xmath10 individual power spectra and finally average them to obtain the resulting power spectrum .",
    "specific double - logarithmic plots are shown in figs .",
    "[ x7]-[x10 ] . the power spectra follow power laws with exponents @xmath12 .",
    "the results of the probability distribution and power spectra analysis are summarized in table i.",
    "friction is believed to occur on the atomic scale due to asperities on the surfaces in contacts .",
    "the simplest way to model such asperities is to use lattice models in the spirit of the invasion percolation @xcite , the sandpile model @xcite , bak - sneppen evolution model @xcite , and zaitsev s robin hood model @xcite . in general , these models are too crude to provide quantitative agreement with all experimental statistical quantities .",
    "however , quantities such as distribution of avalanche sizes are usually described by power laws characterized by exponents belonging to a few distinct universality classes .",
    "these exponents may be compared with experimentally found ones .",
    "if several models belong to the same universality class , it is reasonable to study the simplest among them , since it will provide the clearest understanding of the physical mechanisms of the phenomenon under study .",
    "one such simple and elegant example is the robin hood model , which was originally proposed for dislocation movement @xcite and later was adopted for modeling dry friction @xcite by slanina who added to the original robin - hood model several parameters aimed to better capture the dry friction mechanism , but essentially obtained the same type of behavior as the original model had .",
    "here we return to the original robin hood model due to its simplicity .",
    "the model consist of a @xmath13-dimensional lattice .",
    "each site @xmath14 on this lattice at any time step @xmath15 is characterized by the height @xmath16 which we assume to be the height of an atomic scale asperity at a given point of the interface between two bodies in contact . here",
    "we present the model for @xmath17 , which is an appropriate choice to model slide friction but the analytical treatment is the same in any dimension , although the physically relevant cases are only @xmath17 and @xmath18 . as the bodies slide against each other , the asperity with the maximal height is destroyed and some random number of atoms from this asperity is distributed among the neighboring asperities . to be specific , at each time",
    "step the site @xmath14 with maximal height @xmath19 is found and the new heights are determined according to the following rule : @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are independent random variables uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 .",
    "( robin hood determines the richest merchant in the market , robs him by a random amount @xmath22 and distributes it equally among the neighbors without leaving anything for himself ) . if we assume periodic boundary conditions so that the sites with @xmath23 and @xmath24 are equivalent , the total amount of matter @xmath25 is conserved and we can assume it to be zero . the distance between the surfaces at a given site @xmath14 can be determined as @xmath26 .",
    "the particular details of the model such as the distribution of @xmath22 or the rule of dividing it among neighbors can vary , but the model still retains its soc behavior .",
    "the critical exponents appear to be sensitive to the details of dividing @xmath22 , for example , an exactly solvable asymmetric model ( in which all the profit is given to the site on the left ) @xcite belongs to a different universality class .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that in a wide class of depinning soc models , all the critical exponents can be expressed in terms of the two main exponents : avalanche dimension @xmath3 and correlation exponent @xmath4 .",
    "the avalanche of threshold @xmath27 is defined as sequence of time steps during which the hight of the maximal asperity is above @xmath27 .",
    "namely , if @xmath28 and @xmath29 while for @xmath30 , @xmath31 , the sequence @xmath32 is called a punctuating avalanche of threshold @xmath27 and mass @xmath33 .",
    "the avalanche dimension describes how the avalanche mass @xmath33 , scales with the horizontal dimension of the avalanche @xmath34 . to be more precise",
    ", the mass distribution of forward avalanches with threshold @xmath27 , scales as @xmath35 and the distribution of the avalanche horizontal size , @xmath34 , scales as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the critical height , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are fisher exponents first introduced to characterized cluster distributions in percolation theory @xcite , while @xmath40 and @xmath41 are exponentially decreasing cutoff functions .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite , that the robin hood model belongs to the same universality class as the linear interface model , for which the values ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 in @xmath17 ; @xmath44 and @xmath45 in @xmath18 ) are given in ref.@xcite . using these values and eq .",
    "( [ tau_s ] ) , one gets @xmath46 for @xmath17 and @xmath47 for @xmath18 .    it can be shown that after the initial equilibration number of time steps @xmath48 , any initial shape of the interface @xmath49 reaches a steady state such that very few @xmath50 `` rich '' sites have @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 plays the role of fractal dimension of rich sites .",
    "only those few rich sites have a chance to be robbed . the chance @xmath54 that at a given time step , the maximal height is equal to @xmath55 decreases for an infinite system @xcite as @xmath56 where the exponent @xmath57 characterizes the dependence of the average avalanche size on its threshold @xmath27 : @xmath58 .",
    "the distribution of heights of the poor sites converges to a smooth distribution on the interval @xmath59 $ ] , while the distribution of the rich sites converges to the distribution with a power law singularity @xmath60 this result is not presented in refs . @xcite but can be justified by the following heuristic arguments .",
    "indeed , the number of sites with @xmath61 scales as the number of the active sites in an avalanche of threshold @xmath27 , and thus scales as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the cutoff of the avalanche distribution ( [ p_r ] ) which scales as @xmath64 thus the probability that @xmath61 scales as @xmath65 and the probability density of @xmath66 scales as @xmath67    we can assume that the friction force , @xmath68 , at a given time step is proportional to the number @xmath69 of asperities with heights between @xmath70 and @xmath71 : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the interaction distance of atomic forces acting between the two surfaces and @xmath74 is a proportionality coefficient , corresponding to the surfaces interaction force at the asperity .",
    "accordingly , the distribution of the friction forces @xmath75 satisfies the equation @xmath76 , where the random variables @xmath77 and @xmath55 are linked by eq .",
    "( [ f_h ] ) . taking into account eqs .",
    "( [ p_h ] ) and ( [ f_h ] ) we have @xmath78 . finally eq . ( [ p_r ] ) yields @xmath79 where @xmath80 for @xmath17 , using values of ref.@xcite we have @xmath81 with @xmath82 which is consistent with the experimental observations of the density of jump sizes presented here and in ref.@xcite . for @xmath18",
    "we have @xmath83 .    in order to test this theoretical predictions , we perform simulations of the one dimensional robin hood model . starting at @xmath84 with a flat interface @xmath85 , and selecting the first site to rob at random , after @xmath86 steps we get all @xmath87 sites of the interface updated at least once . measuring the average @xmath88 for many independent runs for different system sizes , and plotting it versus @xmath87 in a double - logarithmic scale ( fig .",
    "[ t - l ] ) , we can obtain the avalanche dimension @xmath3 as the limit of the successive slopes of this graph for @xmath89 .    a typical shape of the interface at time @xmath90 is presented in fig .",
    "[ h - i ] .",
    "one can see that the height of the majority of sites do not exceed the critical value @xmath91 .",
    "interestingly , the majority of rich sites with heights above the critical barrier are localized in the vicinity of the richest site .",
    "figure [ hist ] shows the histogram of all the interface heights @xmath92 collected over many time steps after the system has reached the steady state and the histogram of the heights of the robbed sites @xmath54 .",
    "one can see that while @xmath92 dramatically increases as @xmath93 , no sites below the critical value are robbed and @xmath94 as @xmath95 . in order to find the exponents governing the behavior of these distributions near the critical point , we plot these quantities in a double logarithmic scale as functions of @xmath96 ( fig .",
    "[ hist]b ) .",
    "finally we determine the time series of forces , defined as the number of heights between @xmath71 and @xmath70 as function of time .",
    "[ f_t ] ) .",
    "the histogram of this time series is presented in fig .",
    "[ fp_f ] in a double logarithmic scale .",
    "the slope of this plot is @xmath97 , which is consistent with the theoretical prediction ( [ mu ] ) .",
    "note that the time series @xmath68 is slightly correlated , which can be demonstrated by the negative slope of its power spectrum @xmath98 in the log - log scale ( fig.[power ] ) .",
    "the explanation of this phenomenon is based on the fact that values @xmath71 fluctuate in the vicinity of @xmath99 in a non - trivial way , so that @xmath71 become less than @xmath100 at time steps @xmath15 separated by intervals distributed according to eq .",
    "( [ p_s ] ) .",
    "this is because these intervals coincide with avalanches for the threshold @xmath101 .",
    "the values of @xmath71 below @xmath100 correspond to the large values forces @xmath68 and thus the intervals between the forces @xmath68 above certain threshold are also distributed according to eq .",
    "( [ p_s ] ) .",
    "it can be shown @xcitethat the exponent @xmath2 of a time series generated by peaks separated by intervals of zero signal distributed according to a power law as in eq .",
    "( [ p_s ] ) is equal to @xmath102 for @xmath103 . thus according to eq .",
    "( [ tau_s ] ) @xmath104 . indeed",
    ", the numerical data of fig .  [ power ] give @xmath105 in a very good agreement to the above theoretical prediction .",
    "however , this value of spectral exponent is much smaller than the values observed experimentally which are in the range between 1 and 2.6 .",
    "this difference is to be expected since the materials in contact as well as the strain gauge have finite elastic constants and inertia which produce a time delay between the applied force and the displacement record by the tribometer and lead to an effective integration of the input force time series .",
    "we would expect that if the materials were infinitely stiff then the experimental force power spectrum should agree with the theoretical predictions .",
    "therefore , we construct a mechanical model of a tribometer , that accounts for these effects .",
    "we assume that the pin of the tribometer contacts the sample at time @xmath106 at a point with coordinate @xmath107 and it is dragged along the sample by the strain gauge spring with spring constant @xmath108 attached to the body of the instrument moving along the sample with constant velocity @xmath109 , which is equivalent to the rotational speed of the disk . the force measured by the tribometer is thus @xmath110 $ ] , which fluctuates as the pin moves against the sample with velocity @xmath111 and acceleration @xmath112 .",
    "the equation of motion of the pin is thus @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the friction force generated by the highest asperity of the sample and @xmath115 is the mass of the pin .",
    "now our goal is to relate @xmath116 ) with the input from the robin hood model .",
    "note , that the physical time @xmath106 is not directly proportional to the time step @xmath15 of the robin hood model , but is equal to the sum of the durations of each time step @xmath117 where the durations @xmath118 are the times needed for the pin to travel a characteristic distance @xmath119 , which is the linear size of each asperity .",
    "we assume that if the pin moves along the sample by @xmath119 , the current asperity is destroyed and the landscape of the contact between the pin and the sample is rearranged according to the rules of the model .",
    "thus the time step @xmath120 of the robin hood model , corresponding to a given moment of time @xmath106 can be determined as @xmath121 $ ] , where @xmath122 $ ] denotes the integer part of the expression in the brackets .",
    "if @xmath123 , @xmath124 $ ] , where @xmath125 is the input from the robin hood model , and @xmath126 is some material and load - dependent constant . if @xmath127 , @xmath128 $ ] , where @xmath129 is some dissipative constant .",
    "constant @xmath126 is proportional to the load and depends on the elastic properties of the material . introducing dimensionless variables by @xmath130 and @xmath131",
    ", we arrive to a dimensionless equation @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 is the same as @xmath114 but the constants @xmath126 and @xmath135 are changed by @xmath136 , @xmath137 .",
    "thus , there are three independent dimensionless parameters of the model : @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "varying these parameters , we found a wide region in the parameter space in which the power spectrum of the model resembles the experimental one .",
    "a typical example of the spectrum for @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 is shown on fig.([sf ] ) .",
    "the frequency of the resonance peak is determined by @xmath144 .",
    "the peak becomes more pronounced as we decrease @xmath140 .",
    "the increase in @xmath140 also increases the slope of the spectrum .",
    "the increase of @xmath139 at given @xmath138 increases the frequency region in which the power spectrum follows the power law but it also increases the absolute value of the slope closer to @xmath145 , a characteristic value of the brownian motion . in general , an integration of the time series corresponds to the increase of the spectral exponent by 2 , so the integration of the white noise produces the brownian noise .",
    "the observed spectral exponent @xmath146 suggests that in a certain range of parameters , our model acts as the fractional integrator of the input signal . for a very stiff spring and large dissipation ( @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 ) the output signal of our equation",
    "is not much different from the input time series @xmath125 and we recover the small value of the spectral exponent @xmath150 .",
    "we present experimental results and theoretical arguments that support the presence of self organized criticality in dry sliding friction .",
    "the experiments are pin - on - disk friction force traces of aluminum - aluminum and steel - steel systems . in both cases and for a variety of normal loads ,",
    "the distribution of the friction force jumps and the frequency power spectra are power laws .",
    "the theoretical arguments are based on the application of the robin hood model to the friction problem .",
    "this model provides rules by which the surface profile changes as a function of time .",
    "the model introduces a height @xmath151 that we interpret physically as the height of the asperity . at each time step ,",
    "atoms from the highest asperity are distributed among neighboring sites .",
    "we use the known distribution of heights and of maximal heights @xmath55 of the robin hood model to obtain the time series of the friction forces created by the asperities . as the maximum height fluctuates near the critical value , the number of smaller asperities whose heights are within the reach of atomic forces also fluctuates , diverging as @xmath55 comes close to the critical value @xmath99 .",
    "these smaller asperities correspond to the contact sites and are responsible for the friction force . specifically , the friction force is proportional to the number of contacts .",
    "thus we propose that the friction force at a given time step is proportional to the probability density of the interface heights at the current value of the maximal height .",
    "the statistical distribution of the friction forces is studied both numerically and analytically .",
    "we also find that the large forces are bunched in time .",
    "this is due to fluctuations of the maximal heights above a constant critical height .",
    "when the maximum heights return to the critical value , the forces become large .",
    "thus , the surface waxes and wanes between a situation of large force due to many asperities acting , and a situation of smaller force in which only few asperities are in contact .",
    "in addition , we use the time series of forces as an input to the newton s equation which describes the kinematics of the pin . for stiff or massless materials ,",
    "the experimental distribution of force jumps should coincide with the theoretical distribution of forces .",
    "however , materials have finite mass and elasticity and thus the experimentally measured friction forces differ from the actual forces at the contact . to investigate these effects , we solve this equation numerically for different values of the parameters and find good agreement with the experiment .",
