    "the phase separation ( ps ) and the effect of quenched disorder have been studied intensively in the hole doped manganites with chemical formula @xmath4@xmath5mno@xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the trivalent rare earth and divalent alkaline earth element , respectively.@xcite at low temperature ( @xmath9 ) , the dynamics of the ps systems are quite interesting as they exhibit various fascinating experimental features similar to spin glass ( sg ) system @xcite like , long time relaxation and aging effect,@xcite rejuvenation and persistent memory effect,@xcite memory and aging effect,@xcite etc .",
    "it is commonly believed that the glassy behavior in the ps systems originates due to the strong interactions among the magnetic clusters which induces the collectivity and slow dynamics in the system , yet , whether their dynamics is consistent with the classical sg systems or not is under debate.@xcite sometimes , these self - generated clusters are also thermally blocked at low temperature yielding superparamagnetic ( spm ) behavior.@xcite it remains a challenging task to discern between the sg and spm behavior due to their many shared features , however , their dynamics are quite different in terms of relaxation time which is _ critically _ slow in former case compared to slow but non - critical in later systems . hence , a serious endeavor in experimental investigation is required to characterize the low temperature magnetic state in the ps compounds . in this context , the non - linear susceptibility turns out to be rather useful tool because it leaves distinct signatures for sg vis-@xmath10-vis spm like systems.@xcite    here we investigate the low temperature dynamics of ps manganite using a representative ceramic compound pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mn@xmath1ga@xmath2o@xmath3 ( psmgo ) by means of dc magnetization ( @xmath11 ) , linear and nonlinear ac susceptibility ( @xmath12 ) , magnetic relaxation and magnetic memory measurements .",
    "the parent compound pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath3 ( psmo ) is a half doped medium bandwidth manganite .",
    "on cooling from the room temperature , it shows second - order paramagnetic ( pm ) to ferromagnetic ( fm ) transition followed by first - order fm to antiferromagntic ( afm ) transition where the later is shown to be kinetically arrested.@xcite the psmo exhibits ps effect where the coexistence of fm and afm clusters arise just below the pm - fm transition temperature @xmath13 and persists down to low temperature.@xcite the introduction of quenched disorder in psmo in the form of nonmagnetic ga substitution at mn - site has very interesting consequences which suppresses the fm state and reduces the size of the fm clusters.@xcite these results agree with the theoretical prediction by imry and ma who argued in favor of destabilization of long range order system in presence of the quenched disorder,@xcite which have also wide ramifications on the observed griffiths phase like behavior in psmo.@xcite the compound under study i.e. , psmgo where 7.5% ga is substituted at the mn - site of psmo , is quite interesting because although its @xmath14 resemble with sg system , the compound exhibits ferromagnetism , albeit highly inhomogeneous , and the fm cluster size is reduced significantly.@xcite with this reduced size of fm clusters , the competition between thermal and magnetic energies of the clusters can give rise to various types of magnetic states ( behaviors ) at low temperature , which coupled with the presence of mixed interactions make this compound an ideal choice to study the dynamics and determine the low-@xmath9 magnetic state in the ps system .",
    "our results imply that the coexisting nanometer size fm clusters are thermally blocked at low temperature showing spm behavior .",
    "interestingly , this phenomenon is observed after a multiple magnetic transitions ( pm - fm - afm ) which otherwise usually occurs after only fm or afm transition .",
    "it is however noteworthy that below the blocking temperature @xmath15 , the system exhibits long time magnetic relaxation , aging effect , zero field cooled ( zfc ) and field cooled ( fc ) memory effect which are usually considered to be the benchmark of glassy dynamics .",
    "though the first experimental evidence of low temperature blocked clusters in manganite has been shown for pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mn@xmath16al@xmath17o@xmath6 ( ref . ) but the nature of clusters as well as the blocking mechanism appears to be different in present study .",
    "we attribute the observed experimental features in psmgo to the intercluster interaction of the fm entities embedded in the afm matrix .",
    "polycrystalline sample pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mn@xmath1ga@xmath2o@xmath3 has been prepared by the standard solid state ceramic route .",
    "this sample is a member of a series presented in ref . where the sample preparation and characterization techniques have been given in detail .",
    "all the magnetic measurements have been performed in quantum design made vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) and home made ac susceptometer.@xcite for the magnetic relaxation measurements , the sample has been cooled in zero field to the desired temperatures . after proper thermal stabilization a magnetic field ( @xmath18 ) is applied and magnetization has been measured as a function of time ( @xmath19 ) . for the memory measurements , protocol has been described at the respective places in text .",
    "the inset shows the variation of peak temperature as a function of applied field.,width=264 ]",
    "fig . 1 presents the dc magnetization measured in 100 oe following the zero field cooled ( zfc ) , field cooled cooling ( fcc ) and field cooled warming ( fcw ) protocols . with lowering the temperature ,",
    "magnetization measured in these three protocols initially increases and then decreases till about 50 k , showing a peak .",
    "the behavior of @xmath20 appears to mimic that for the sg systems , however , it has been shown that , similar to parent compound psmo , the composition psmgo also exhibits fm state which is highly suppressed and inhomogeneous due to disorder ( ga substitution).@xcite the inflection points in d@xmath11/d@xmath9 plot are used to calculate the pm to fm transition temperature ( @xmath13 ) and fm to af transition temperature ( @xmath21 ) , which are found to be around 174 k and 152 k , respectively .",
    "a thermal hysteresis ( th ) between the fcc and fcw branches of magnetization is evident in fig . 1 which starts below the @xmath13 and",
    "persists down to low temperature .",
    "the th in magnetization is normally observed around the first order transition due to the supercooling and superheating of the high-@xmath9 and low-@xmath9 phases , respectively .",
    "however , the observed th in present study indicates the coexistence of fm and afm clusters in wide temperature range .",
    "moreover , there remains a significant difference between the fc and zfc branches of magnetization at low temperature which arises due to the arrested transformation kinetics of the high-@xmath9 fm phase into the low-@xmath9 afm phases similar to the parent compound.@xcite     has been plotted as a function of temperature for pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mn@xmath1ga@xmath2o@xmath3 . in inset ,",
    "the same has been shown for the imaginary part.,width=264 ]    an important observation is noticed at low temperature in fig",
    ". 1 where the system exhibits a new magnetic state which is marked by a peak or cusp in @xmath22 around 23 k and the enhanced splitting between the zfc and fc magnetization below the peak .",
    "note , that no th is present between the fcc and fcw below the peak which discards the possibility of reentrant fm state at low temperature .",
    "usually , this kind of experimental feature is associated with the sg like freezing or spm like blocking mechanism .",
    "we have examined the effect of magnetic field on this peak .",
    "inset of fig .",
    "1 shows that with increasing the measuring field peak in @xmath22 shifts to lower temperature being consistent with sg or spm behavior .",
    "however , the shifting of peak temperature with field here does not follow any functional form like de almeida and thouless ( at ) line or gabay and toulouse ( gt ) line where the peak temperature varies @xmath23 @xmath24 or @xmath23 @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "it can be mentioned that such lines were predicted for phase transition in the mean field theory for sg,@xcite and even have been observed for spm system with interparticle interaction.@xcite    to characterize the low temperature magnetic phase in this compound we have utilized the ac-@xmath12 which probes the dynamic nature of spin state in very low field . in general , magnetization can be written in terms of measuring field as :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the spontaneous magnetization , @xmath28 is the linear and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , ... are the nonlinear susceptibilities .",
    "temperature dependence of the real part of first order ac-@xmath12 ( @xmath31 ) measured in 2.5 oe ac field and frequency ( @xmath32 ) of 331 hz is shown in main panel of fig .",
    "the @xmath31 exhibits a sharp peak in conformity with the low temperature anomaly observed ( @xmath33 23k ) in dc-@xmath11 as shown in fig .",
    "the peak temperature ( @xmath15 ) as calculated from the low field ac-@xmath12 is 27.5 k. the corresponding imaginary part ( @xmath34 ) , which signifies the magnetic loss , is plotted in the inset of fig . 2 and shows peak at the same temperature of @xmath31 .",
    "these results imply that peak in @xmath22 at low temperature is associated with either sg or spm like behavior .     and @xmath30 measured in ac field 2.5 oe and frequency 331 hz are plotted against the temperature for pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mn@xmath1ga@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "( b ) the maximum value of @xmath30 has been plotted as a function of applied ac field which clearly shows the noncritical behavior of @xmath30 with the applied field.,width=302 ]    considering the fact that both sg and spm have many common experimental features rendering the identification of these phases quite difficult , we have used nonlinear ac susceptibilities which are shown to be an effective probe to discern between various magnetic phases.@xcite in fig .",
    "3a , we have shown the temperature variation in second order ( @xmath29 ) and third order ( @xmath30 ) ac susceptibility measured in 2.5 oe ac - field of frequency 331 hz . usually , @xmath29 becomes evident in experiment due to the symmetry breaking field which originates from either the spontaneous magnetization ( @xmath35 ) or superimposed dc magnetic field.@xcite as for canonical sg , @xmath35 does not exist , therefore the @xmath29 is not evident in absence of dc field .",
    "however , there is a finite negative @xmath29 in fig .",
    "3a around @xmath15 which discards the possibility of sg like behavior in this compound .",
    "similarly , @xmath36 also shows the characteristic negative peak around @xmath15 similar to spm compound ( fig .",
    "3a).@xcite to confirm the spm behavior in psmgo we have measured @xmath37 at different applied fields because for sg , it has been conclusively shown that @xmath30 diverges as @xmath38.@xcite in fig .",
    "3b we have plotted the maximum of @xmath30 as a function of the applied ac field .",
    "it is clear in figure that the @xmath30 shows noncritical behavior against the field , thus confirms the spm behavior in this compound .     above the blocking temperature .",
    "straight line is a @xmath39 fit to the @xmath28 data following eq .",
    "3 . inset : similar temperature dependence of @xmath30 above the blocking temperature and the straight line is a @xmath40 fit to @xmath30 data following eq .",
    "4.,width=264 ]    we have further confirmed the spm behavior of the magnetic clusters in psmgo from the wohlfarth s model which shows the magnetization of an assembly of particles can be given as:@xcite    @xmath41    where n is the number of particles per unit volume , @xmath42 is the average moment of each magnetic particle , @xmath43 is the boltzmann constant and l(x ) is the langevin function . after the expansion of l(x )",
    ", @xmath28 and @xmath30 above the @xmath15 can be expressed as a function temperature as following :    @xmath44    @xmath45    the eqs . 3 and 4",
    "imply that for spm , @xmath28 and @xmath30 will vary linearly above the @xmath15 as a function of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the main panel of fig .",
    "4 clearly shows that @xmath31 is linearly dependent on @xmath39 above the @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , in inset of fig .",
    "3 the linear behavior of @xmath46 vs @xmath40 is depicted above the @xmath15 . moreover , from the ratio of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we have estimated the value of @xmath42 which comes out to be around 8.98 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 , where @xmath51 is the effective bohr magneton .",
    "this large value of @xmath42 in consistent with the spm clusters as it consists of large number of spins compared to pm where the @xmath42 is limited to only few @xmath51 .",
    "assuming that the clusters are spherical , their effective size is calculated from the @xmath42 yielding the value around 15 nm .",
    "this small size of the fm clusters that are embedded within the afm matrix in psmgo is in agreement with the results in ref . , and shows the significance of disorder created by nonmagnetic ( ga ) substitution , which simply reduces the size of fm clusters without adding magnetic interactions in the system .",
    "the above results , however , constitute a conclusive proof in favor of spm behavior of the fm clusters which are even though magnetically ordered at @xmath13 , but due to their smaller size the moments fluctuate coherently , and they are thermally blocked at low temperature .",
    "it is more intriguing that for the compound pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mn@xmath1ga@xmath2o@xmath3 where the mixed interactions in the form of fm and afm are evident , nevertheless , the system exhibits spm behavior .",
    "after being confirmed the spm behavior in psmgo , we will now study the other phenomenon like magnetic relaxation , aging , memory effects , etc . which are typical to the ps systems .",
    "to look into the magnetic relaxation in this compound , we have measured time dependent magnetization , @xmath52 , in 100 oe at 5 , 10 , 15 and 20 k for a time span of 7200 s , and the data are presented in fig .",
    "5 after normalized by @xmath53 .",
    "we find that magnetization increases continuously , however , it is evident in the figure that with the increasing temperature the relaxation rate ( @xmath54 ) increases up to 15 k then decreases .",
    "the decreased @xmath54 at low temperatures is in agreement with the spm system due to the reduced thermal fluctuation . at 20 k",
    ", @xmath54 again falls as this temperature is close to the @xmath15 in this measuring field ( fig .",
    "interestingly , the growth of @xmath52 exhibits a nonlogarithmic time dependence at all temperatures unlike simple spm system where the magnetization grows exponentially with time .",
    "this slow relaxation in this compound suggests the presence of correlated behavior which may arise due to the intercluster interaction and will be discussed in next sections .",
    "= @xmath55 and @xmath50 s. ( b ) the magnetic relaxation rate @xmath56 ( defined in text ) as extracted from the data in ( a ) have been plotted as a function of time for different wait time.,width=226 ]    to probe the aging effect we have cooled the sample in zero field to 10 k ( @xmath57 ) , and after waiting for certain amount of time ( @xmath58 ) we have applied the field and recorded @xmath52 . in general , the aging occurs when the physical properties of a system evolve with time giving rise to a nonstationary phenomenon , and is known as a characteristic feature of correlated dynamics.@xcite the phenomenon of aging is , however , explained within the framework of existing models for sg .",
    "one is the droplet model suggested by fisher and huse@xcite and another is the hierarchical model as realized from the parisi s solution of sherrington - kirkpatrick hamiltonian.@xcite the former model assumes the distribution of droplets of correlated spins which grow during @xmath58 to lower its energy by reducing the interface between the droplets of reverse character . the application of field after @xmath58 probes the correlated domains or droplets with time . on the other hand",
    ", the hierarchical model considers the metastable states , as separated by the finite barriers , are hierarchically organized in the free - energy landscape .",
    "this hierarchical structure is a function of temperature where the metastable states further split into the new ( sub)states with decrease in temperature and merge into new state as temperature increases . in this approach ,",
    "aging leads to distribution of population among the accessible states which evolves with time .",
    "however , the collective dynamics is required for the aging effect , hence many different systems like the ferrofluid with dipolar interactions@xcite or the discontinuous multilayer with fm particles@xcite are known to exhibit the aging effect .",
    "the measured @xmath52 with @xmath58 = @xmath55 and @xmath50 s for psmgo have been presented in fig .",
    "6a after normalized by @xmath59 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the @xmath52 varies with @xmath58 even though it is measured at same temperature and field which indicates that system ages during @xmath58 .",
    "note , that @xmath52 does not exhibit any significant difference with @xmath58 up to @xmath55 s in present case , and the difference in @xmath52 is observed with high @xmath58 only .",

    "inset shows the memory effect as measured in zero field cooled protocol ( see in text ) where a stop of 7200 s has been given at 18 k.,width=264 ]    the collective behavior often manifest itself through the magnetic memory effect . to test this ,",
    "we have examined the fc memory effect which is shown to be characteristic feature of the interacting particle system.@xcite for this purpose , we have cooled the sample in field ( 100 oe ) while collecting the magnetization data . during this fc process",
    ", we gave intermittent stop at temperature @xmath62 where the field has been withdrawn for a time @xmath63 at constant temperature thus allowing the system to relax , and then we resumed the fc process .",
    "we have selected @xmath62 = 20 , 15 and 10 k and @xmath63 = 7200 s in our measurement . as evident in fig .",
    "7 , the fc magnetization without ` stop and wait ' ( @xmath64 ) rises continuously up to the lowest temperature .",
    "the fc magnetization with wait ( @xmath65 ) shows lower value at each @xmath62 after the wait , however , with further cooling @xmath65 increases similar to @xmath64 .",
    "this indicates that during @xmath63 the system ages through the distribution of particles among the available energy states .",
    "it remains interesting that upon subsequent reheating in same field , the magnetization ( @xmath66 ) shows upturn at each @xmath62 and attempts to reaches the @xmath65 value at few kelvin above the @xmath62 . in another way",
    ", the system remembers the waiting history during the fc process .",
    "this observed memory effect is quite noteworthy and implies the collective behavior in this compound arises from the intercluster interactions.@xcite    however , it has been subsequently shown that the noninteracting particles with the distribution of energy barriers can also give rise to the similar fc memory effect,@xcite therefore to confirm the intercluster interaction in this compound we have checked the zfc memory effect . for this measurement ,",
    "the sample has been cooled in zero field where during the cooling a temporary stop and wait is given at temperature @xmath62 ( @xmath67 ) for time @xmath63 . during wait time the system relaxes toward equilibrium state . then after reaching the low temperature , a field of 100 oe has been applied and @xmath20 ( @xmath68 ) is subsequently recorded upon reheating .",
    "we have selected @xmath62 = 18 k and @xmath63 = 7200 s. for the system with interaction among the particles / clusters , the @xmath68 shows the lower value around @xmath62 than the zfc magnetization ( @xmath69 ) collected without stop and wait protocol .",
    "in other way , the @xmath70 exhibits dip around the @xmath62 , signifying that the system has the memory of cooling history .",
    "the extracted @xmath71 has been shown against the temperature in inset of fig .",
    "the @xmath72 clearly exhibits dip at @xmath62 which straightforwardly imply the presence of intercluster interaction in this compound .",
    "this observation of memory effect in the zfc magnetization is quite noteworthy considering the fact that this experimental feature is commonly used as an identifying tool for the glassy behavior in many systems@xcite whereas the present system exhibits spm behavior without an ambiguity .",
    "nonetheless , this study shows that the collective behavior that causes slow dynamics is the prerequisite for different aging and memory effects which can even be evident in interactive spm systems without having glass - like freezing .",
    "it has been discussed earlier that the collective dynamics can be qualitatively explained with the two theoretical models for sg , viz . the droplet model and the hierarchical model . to identify the model which accounts the dynamics in this compound",
    "we have collected the @xmath52 with cycling the temperature . to be specific , in the droplet model scenario the droplets of correlated spins grow with time at particular temperature . with the change in temperature by @xmath73 , the correlation of spins having spatial order larger than @xmath74 breaks and new relaxation starts at temperature @xmath75 . however",
    ", this process is symmetric with the direction of @xmath73 . on the contrary , in hierarchical model as the metastable states either split or merge with the decrease or increase in temperature respectively , thus the direction of @xmath73 should have asymmetric effect .",
    "based on these arguments , the measured @xmath52 with positive and negative temperature cycle can be helpful to identify the appropriate model for the system.@xcite in fig . 8a , we present the relaxation data following a protocol where the sample has been cooled in zero field from the room temperature to 15 k. after stabilization of temperature , a magnetic field of 100 oe is applied and @xmath52 is measured for time @xmath76 . then , without changing the field the sample is cooled to 10 k and @xmath52 is recorded for time @xmath77 , and then the sample is heated back to 15 k and @xmath52 is measured for the time @xmath78 .",
    "we used @xmath79 = 4000 s. it is evident in figure that @xmath52 increases continuously at 15 k during @xmath76 , but the relaxation at 10 k during @xmath77 is almost halted .",
    "however , system resumes its relaxation again at 15 k during @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , it is observed in figure that the magnetic relaxation at 15 k during @xmath78 is nearly a continuation of that during @xmath76 .",
    "similarly , we have measured @xmath52 for the positive @xmath73 where the intermittent temperature is increased to 20 k and data are shown in fig .",
    "it is observed that magnetization relaxes both at 15 and 20 k but when the system is cooled back to 15 k , the relaxation is almost halted and @xmath52 during @xmath78 is not a continuation of that during @xmath76 .",
    "this asymmetrical behavior of magnetic relaxation with the positive and negative temperature cycle is quite intriguing .",
    "the droplet model being symmetric with the direction of temperature change , we attempt to explain this behavior with the hierarchical model . following this , at lower temperature the metastable states are divided , therefore the relaxation occurs among the newly born sub states because the barrier between the original states increases with lowering the temperature . when the system is heated back to the original temperature the initial states are recovered with the unchanged relative occupation . as a result ,",
    "the magnetization during @xmath78 is almost continuation of @xmath76 at same temperature .",
    "however , this is not the case for the positive @xmath73 as during the relaxation at higher temperature , the relative occupation of states are changed because they are merged into the new state .",
    "consequently , when the system is cooled back to original temperature , the @xmath52 does not match with the earlier value .",
    "the asymmetric behavior in magnetic relaxation with the temperature change in fig .",
    "8 clearly imply that the dynamics in psmgo is well explained by the hierarchical model .",
    "nonetheless , this observation is quite intriguing for the ps manganites where the models were originally proposed for the sg dynamics .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the low-@xmath9 dynamics in pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mn@xmath1ga@xmath2o@xmath3 , a manganite around half - doping .",
    "this compound exhibits the ps phenomenon where the fm and afm clusters coexist and the size of the former is substantially reduced due to the substitution of nonmagnetic ga at mn - site .",
    "a new magnetic anomaly appears at low temperature which is marked by a peak in zfc magnetization . from the detailed measurements of dc magnetization as well as linear and nonlinear",
    "ac susceptibility we infer that this peak at low temperature arises due to the thermal blocking of nano - meter size fm clusters exhibiting spm behavior .",
    "it is , however , intriguing that all the experimental features related to collective dynamics and glass - like freezing e.g. slow magnetic relaxation , aging effect , memory effect in both fc and zfc magnetization are evident in this compound .",
    "based on these results we conclude that the presence of collective behavior which arises from the intercluster interaction in psmgo .",
    "moreover , the asymmetric behavior of magnetic relaxation with the positive and negative temperature cycle imply that the dynamics in this compound can be explained by invoking the hierarchical model rather than the droplet model which are commonly used to describe the collective dynamics in glassy systems .",
    "we believe that this study would stimulate the theoretical and experimental investigations to understand the dynamics in ps system at low temperature , in particular with intercluster interaction .",

    "<S> we investigate the dynamics of magnetization in the phase separated ( ps ) state after introducing the quenched disorder at the mn - site of a manganite around half doping . </S>",
    "<S> the compound , pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mn@xmath1ga@xmath2o@xmath3 , exhibits ps with the coexistence of ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) clusters where the size of the fm clusters is substantially reduced due to the disorder introduced by nonmagnetic ga substitution . at low temperature </S>",
    "<S> , the system develops a new magnetic anomaly , which is marked by a peak in the zero field cooled magnetization . detailed study of linear as well as nonlinear ac susceptibilities coupled with dc magnetization indicates that this peak arises due to the thermal blocking of nanometer size fm clusters demonstrating superparamagnetic behavior . the system , however , exhibits slow magnetic relaxation , aging effect , memory effect in both field cooled and zero field cooled magnetization below the blocking temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these imply the presence of collective behavior induced by the interaction between the clusters . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the magnetic relaxation measured with positive and negative temperature excursions exhibits asymmetric response suggesting that the dynamics in this phase separated system is accounted by the hierarchical model rather than the droplet model which are commonly used to describe the similar collective dynamics in glassy system . </S>"
