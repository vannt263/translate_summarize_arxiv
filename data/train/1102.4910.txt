    "radio - band observations of absorption systems along the sight - lines to distant quasars provide a powerful probe of the cool atomic and molecular gas at high redshift .",
    "this gas constitutes the reservoir of raw material which forms stars , planets and all other non - diffuse structures in the early universe . as well as giving insight into how the contents of present day galaxies came to be , redshifted  21-cm and oh 18-cm absorption lines",
    "have the potential to be very useful in determining whether the fundamental constants of nature have changed since these large look - back times ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "unfortunately , such absorption is currently rare , with only 76  21-cm absorbers known at @xmath5 , 41 of which are due to intervening systems ( summarised in @xcite ) , with 35 being associated with the quasar / quasar host providing the background illumination ( summarised in @xcite ) .",
    "oh 18-cm absorption is rarer still , with only five systems known @xcite , three of which are intervening and two being associated with the background source .",
    "all of the oh and 80% of detected  absorption occurs at @xmath6 .",
    "much of this bias is due to the limited availability of interference free bands at low frequencies , although there are additional effects contributing to lower detection rates at high redshift : for the intervening , systems the 21-cm detection rates ( 61% at @xmath6 cf .",
    "33% at @xmath7 , @xcite ) can be attributed to the geometry effects introduced by a flat expanding universe , causing the coverage of the background flux to be systematically lower at higher redshift @xcite . for associated systems , the rates ( 39% at @xmath6 cf .",
    "17% at @xmath7 ) are biased by the traditional optical selection of targets , where only the most ultra - violet luminous sources are known at high redshift , since the intense uv flux from the near - by active galactic nucleus ionises / excites the cool gas beyond detection @xcite .",
    "although both of these effects are present in some cases at @xmath6 , although they are always present for the high redshift sources .",
    "optical selection effects further compound the detection of oh absorption in that , despite much searching of objects in the millimetre - band , where four of the five oh absorbers were originally discovered , millimetre - wave absorption has yet to be found in an optically selected target ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that this is due to the optical brightness of these objects selecting against the dustier , and thus most molecular friendly absorbers .",
    "this is demonstrated through the optically selected damped lyman-@xmath8 absorption systems ( dlas ) having optical  near infrared colours of @xmath9 and molecular fractions of @xmath10 , whereas the radio absorbers have @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( see figure 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "this is strong evidence that the background quasar light is reddened by the dust in the foreground absorber , which protects the molecular gas from the harsh uv environment .",
    "thus , in order to increase the number of redshifted oh ( and ) absorbers known , we should target the reddest objects in the gravitational lens intervening pks 0132097 @xcite : with the detection of 21-cm absorption @xcite and an optical  near - infrared colour of @xmath13 along this sight - line @xcite , this was a prime target . on this basis , we ourselves attempted to detect oh with both the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) and the westerbork synthesis radio telescope in february 2005 .",
    "however , severe rfi at 945 mhz ruined both observations . ] .",
    "however , due to their very faintness , optical spectra are not generally available and so we do not have a redshift to which to tune the telescope .",
    "we have therefore embarked on a programme of wide - band ( 200 & 800 mhz ) spectral scans of very red ( @xmath14 ) radio - loud objects with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) in search of the dust and molecular gas responsible for the obscuration . in this letter",
    "we report the detection of very strong 21-cm absorption at @xmath2 towards the @xmath15 quasar mg j0414 + 0534 ( 4c+05.19 ) , where we have previously detected 21-cm in the @xmath1 gravitational lens @xcite . with an optical  near - infrared colour of @xmath16 ,",
    "this is the reddest of our targets , and , although 21-cm has also been detected in the lens , as well as in the host galaxy @xcite , oh remains undetected at either of these three redshifts .",
    "as mentioned above , all of our targets were selected on the basis of their large optical  near - infrared colours ( @xmath14 ) and high radio fluxes ( @xmath17 jy ) .",
    "being a database of bright and generally compact objects , with comprehensive optical photometry @xcite , these were taken from the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample ( phfs , @xcite ) , which , with the above conditions , gave five sources which could be scanned for both  and oh by the gbt .",
    "however , given the very wide band - widths required for the full spectral scans , much of the data are subject to severe radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , with only limited parts of the band being useful ( tanna et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "nevertheless , we are able to obtain enough useful data on mg j0414 + 0534 to reveal a clear , strong detection of neutral hydrogen .    the 0.911.23 ghz range of the j0414 + 0534 observations were performed on 23 january 2007 using the pf2 receiver and the autocorrelation spectrometer over a 200 mhz wide bandpass ( with 16384 lags ) , centred on 1.0 ghz in two orthogonal linear polarisations .",
    "this band was observed for a total of two hours in 5  min position - switched scans , and the removal rfi affected scans left 44 minutes of good data , with a mean system temperature of @xmath18  k and an r.m.s .",
    "noise level of @xmath19 mjy per 3.56  ( at 1030 mhz ) channel in the clear parts of the bandpass .",
    "mhz towards j0414 + 0534 in each of the two orthogonal linear polarisations .",
    "the data are shown at the observed 12.207  khz channel spacing , which gives 3.56  at 1030 mhz .",
    "the flux density is found to be 2.21 jy at 1.03 ghz , cf .",
    "the 2.12 jy at 1.4 ghz @xcite . ]",
    "the data were calibrated , flagged and averaged using the gbtidl package and , as seen in each of the polarisations , an absorption feature was detected close to 1030 mhz ( fig . [ pols ] ) . due to the structure of the line and the strength of the main component ( a velocity integrated optical depth of @xmath20 ) , we believe that the feature is due to 21-cm absorption at a redshift of @xmath21 .",
    "in each polarisation ( fig . [ pols ] )",
    "it is clear that the absorption is comprised of several components and in fig .",
    "[ gauss ] we show the gaussian fits to the profile and summarise these in table [ fits ] .    ) .",
    "the flux scale is relative to 2.21 jy and the velocity offset is relative to the central observing frequency of 1.000 ghz . as fig .",
    "[ pols ] , the velocity resolution is 3.56  . ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a single gaussian fit to the main component gives @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 for the redshift of the absorber .",
    "this , in addition to the separate gaussian fits to the blue and redshifted features ( see below ) , gives a velocity integrated optical depth of @xmath24 .",
    "this is the strongest intervening 21-cm absorber yet found ( see table 1 of @xcite and figure 12 of @xcite ) , the next being at @xmath25 towards b0235 + 164 with @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "the line strength gives a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the spin temperature of the gas and @xmath29 the coverage of the background flux by the absorber .",
    "given that @xmath30  k is the minimum typical value of this degeneracy ( see @xcite ) , it is clear that the neutral hydrogen column density in this absorber is large , @xmath31 , which is in the top 2% of sloan digital sky survey data release 5 dlas @xcite .",
    "the largest is @xmath32 , a value which is exceeded by the absorber for @xmath4  k .",
    "in addition to the main component , there is a strong red - shifted and a weaker blue - shifted component , offset at @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "these features have absorption line strengths which are @xmath35% and @xmath36% of the main profile ( @xmath37 ) , the redshifted feature being as strong as any of those in the main profile ( table [ fits ] ) .",
    "we interpret these as being due to outflows from the nucleus of the galaxy , which contain a significant portion of the absorbing gas .",
    "this is reminiscent of the circinus galaxy , a near - by seyfert in which the outflowing molecular gas mass is comparable with that in the disk @xcite .    if the disk of the galaxy intervenes most of the background flux , as may be evident from the large optical depth , the relatively narrow full - width half maximum of the main profile ( fwhm@xmath38 ) may suggest a low to intermediate inclination for the galactic disk .",
    "thus , this may have an axis direction similar to that of the outflow , which we believe is directed close to the line - of - sight , since it must intercept much of the flux from j0414 + 0534 . at 1.4 ghz @xcite , which is 26 kpc at @xmath2 ( @xmath39  km  s@xmath40  mpc@xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) .",
    "] however , this is not a necessity , as the galactic disk ( in which the absorption occurs ) need not be coplanar with the circumnuclear torus , invoked by unified schemes of active galactic nuclei , which collimates the outflow ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "since the purpose of our spectral scans is to find the intervening molecular gas responsible for the reddening of the background quasar , the frequencies covering the four 18  cm @xmath43 oh lines were observed simultaneously in separate ifs .",
    "given the redshift of the 21-cm absorption , we expect the oh transitions to occur at 1169.15 ( 1612 ) , 1207.71 ( 1665 ) , 1209.13 ( 1667 ) and 1247.69 mhz ( 1720 mhz ) .",
    "examining the data which contain these frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ oh - spectra ] ) , we see that there may indeed be two features coincident with the 1665 ( @xmath44 ) and 1667 mhz ( @xmath45 ) transitions ( oh1667 panel ) , although , even after removal of the worst rfi , the bandpass is somewhat bumpy . from a gaussian fit to the higher frequency feature , we obtain a centroid of @xmath46 mhz , which is where the @xmath45 transition would occur at a redshift of @xmath47 implying that the @xmath44 should be redshifted to @xmath48 mhz .",
    "however , this is observed at @xmath49 , which in conjunction with the fact that @xmath50 is out of the range of any of the  features ( table  [ fits ] ) , leads us to conclude that these are artifacts of an unstable bandpass .",
    "since the 1665 mhz band is the cleanest over the 21-cm redshift , we use this transition to obtain an optical depth limit .",
    "@xcite found a correlation between the  and oh profile widths for the five known redshifted oh absorbers and so we resample the r.m.s .",
    "noise level of 1.8 mjy per 10  to the fwhm of the main 21-cm absorption profile .",
    "this gives a @xmath51 limit of @xmath52  per 86  or @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the excitation temperature of the gas .",
    "normalising this by the line strength of the main 21-cm profile gives @xmath55 , which is five times more sensitive than our previous limit in the @xmath1 gravitational lens ( fig .",
    "[ ohoverh ] ) .",
    "if the molecular abundance is correlated with the red colour of the background quasar @xcite ) , it is apparent that none of the two known intervening 21-cm absorbing systems towards j0414 + 0534 is the cause of the reddening .",
    "furthermore , from oh observations at the host galaxy redshift ( curran et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    ", we have obtained a limit of @xmath56  per 5  from the @xmath57 transition .",
    "rescaling this to the fwhm of @xmath58  for the 21-cm profile @xcite , gives @xmath59 , or a normalised line strength of @xmath60 , which may not rule out strong oh absorption in the host galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ ohoverh ] ) .",
    "note that the low hcn abundance ( @xmath61 @xmath62 , for @xmath63  k ) found by @xcite may not rule out a large molecular abundance either , on the basis that @xcite detect strong oh , but no hco@xmath64 , absorption towards pks 0132097 , which @xcite suggest is due to differences in the coverage of the millimetre and decimetre - wave emission .",
    "given that three  absorption systems are now known towards this source , however , it is feasible that the red colour of the background quasar arises from an accumulation of systems , rather than a single dusty intervening galaxy .",
    "having discovered the absorption , the question of its origin arises . there have been a number of optical / near - infrared studies of j0414 + 0534 @xcite , and these show , in addition to the four quasar images ( a1 , a2 , b & c ) and the lensing galaxy , a feature often referred to as `` object x '' ( fig .",
    "[ lens ] ) .",
    "it is located about 1 arc - sec west of component b , giving impact parameters of between 515  kpc ( for @xmath2 ) and 825 kpc ( for @xmath1 ) to the four quasar images .",
    "hst photometry @xcite gives @xmath65 and @xmath66 , thus having a different colour to the quasar images , while probably being slightly redder than the lensing galaxy .",
    "we note that the spectrum of @xcite shows tantalising evidence of peaks approximately where the  @xmath67  doublet would be located for the  absorption redshift of @xmath68 ( observed wavelengths of @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) . the slit position , as indicated in their figure 1 ,",
    "would indeed lie directly across object x and large   emission line fluxes would be expected from an agn or gas - rich galaxy undergoing rapid star - formation , either of which are consistent with the observation of rapid outflows of  in each direction .",
    "as part of an ongoing project , scanning the entire redshift space towards highly reddened radio sources , in search for the object responsible for the obscuration of the optical light , we have detected a second intervening 21-cm absorber at @xmath2 towards the @xmath15 quasar mg j0414 + 0534 .",
    "the other intervening absorber arises in the @xmath1 gravitational lens @xcite and , combined with the absorption found at the host redshift @xcite , gives a total of three  absorbers so far detected along this sight - line .",
    "although we can not determine the @xmath71 degeneracy for any of the three 21-cm absorbers , thus deriving the column densities , the 21-cm line strength in this new absorber is by far the strongest detected along this sight - line , being four times stronger than in the host galaxy [ @xmath72 ] and 19 times stronger than in the lens [ @xmath73 ] .",
    "in fact , the strongest intervening 21-cm absorber found to date .    despite the  absorption strength and the very red colour of this source ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "oh remains undetected to very strong limits [ @xmath55 ] , inferring that this new absorber is not the primary cause of the red colour .",
    "oh is also undetected in the lens and the host galaxy , although the latter is to relatively weak limits not allowing us to rule out that this is where much of the reddening occurs .",
    "we suggest that the absorption may be associated with the feature known as object x in the optical field of j0414 + 0534 : this could be spatially coincident with the spectrum of @xcite , of which the @xmath69 and @xmath70  features are consistent with the expected wavelengths for the  doublet at the redshift of the 21-cm absorption feature .",
    "not being a companion of the lensing galaxy would have implications for the current lens models ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is the fourth only of the ( now ) 42 known redshifted intervening 21-cm absorbers , which have been _ discovered _ through 21-cm absorption , the others being at @xmath75 towards b0809 + 483 @xcite , @xmath76 towards b1328 + 307 @xcite and @xmath77 towards b2351 + 456 @xcite .",
    "the vast majority have been found by tuning the receiver to a frequency based upon the redshift of an a priori detected absorber ( mgii or lyman- ) .",
    "being optically selected , this traditional method biases against the more dust obscured systems and the discovery of two intervening 21-cm absorbers from spectral scans towards j0414 + 0534 , suggests that future surveys with square kilometre array may uncover a large population of faint , dusty high redshift galaxies .",
