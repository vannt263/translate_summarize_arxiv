    "in the following pages we present photoionization - modeling results for _ all _ the ionic column densities constraints found in the hst / stis spectra of pg 0946 + 301 .",
    "we use the @xmath3/@xmath4 plane presentation , applied to optically thin slabs , which is described in   4 of the main paper .",
    "two incident spectra are used for the cloudy models , the standard mathews ",
    "ferland agn spectrum and a modified @xmath5=2 power - law spectrum which is more consistent with the observed far uv spectral shape of the pg 0946 + 301 spectrum .",
    "both spectra are shown in figure [ mf_pl ] .",
    "figures 24 show the results for the modified @xmath5=2 power - law spectrum . in figure 2",
    "we include only the hydrogen and helium results , for helium we have an upper limit which therefore excludes the parameter area above the curve .",
    "figure 3 shows results for the available ionic constraints from 8 `` metals . ''",
    "each curve is labeled by its corresponding ion and the number beneath the label is the @xmath6 constraint . an * following the @xmath6 denotes an upper limit ( excluding the parameter area above the curve ) , otherwise the constraint is a lower limit ( excluding the parameter area below the curve ) .",
    "the small box at the center of the plots identifies the area in parameter space which is fully consistent with 21 ionic constraints , marginally inconsistent with 3 and is strongly inconsistent with 2 ( see   4 for details ) .",
    "figure 4 is identical to figure 7 in the main paper .",
    "figures 58 are similar to figures 24 , using the mathews  ferland agn spectrum . to ease the comparison between results from the two incident continua",
    ", we left the parameter space box at the same location as for the power - law spectrum ."
