    "in recent years , a effect of extreme localization induced by magnetic field has been predicted in a class of two - dimensional rhombus tilings  @xcite .",
    "this effect is related to the interplay between the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect  @xcite and the geometry of the network . for special values of the perpendicular magnetic field ,",

    "ab cage_. this kind of localization does not requires the presence of disorder  @xcite , as it relies on quantum - interference and on the geometry of the lattice .",

    "<S> we present a formalism to study quantum networks made up by single - channel quantum wires in the presence of rashba spin - orbit coupling and magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , linear transport through one - dimensional and two - dimensional finite - size networks is studied by means of the scattering formalism . in some particular quantum networks </S>",
    "<S> , the action of the magnetic field or of the rashba spin - orbit coupling induces localization of the electron wave function . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon , which relies on both the quantum - mechanical interference and the geometry of the network , is manifested through the suppression of the conductance for specific values of the spin - orbit - coupling strength or of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the interplay of the aharonov - bohm phases and of the non - abelian phases , introduced by spin - orbit coupling , is discussed in a number of cases . </S>"
