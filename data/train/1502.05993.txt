    "the reynolds equation @xcite , which is an approximation of the classical navier  stokes equations , describes reasonably well the flow of a large class of fluids whose viscosities can be assumed to be independent of the pressure in many lubrication problems .",
    "however , there is a clear and incontestable evidence , that is well - documented , that attests to the fact that the viscosity varies with pressure , especially so in several problems concerning thin film lubrication , cf .",
    "experiments have shown that in high pressure regimes pressure variations can significantly change the viscosity of certain lubricants and in areas such as elastohydrodynamic lubrication the classical isoviscous lubrication theory is noticeably incapable of explaining the existence of continuous lubricant films , for example , in rolling - contact bearings , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the traditional correction to the reynolds approximation in the piezoviscous regime is based on a rather heuristic assumption that it suffices to replace the constant viscosity in the reynolds equation by a suitable viscosity - pressure relationship , cf .",
    "this approach becomes questionable , however , in high pressure regimes because of the possible change of type ( loss of ellipticity ) of the equations and the potential existence of cross - film pressure gradient , see the discussion in @xcite . in fact , for a reynolds type approximation to be valid in this regime it ought be derived from the full balance of linear momentum equations governing the flow of incompressible fluids with pressure - dependent viscosities .",
    "now , the mathematical theory for the equations that govern the flows of fluids with a pressure - dependent viscosity has been advancing in leaps and bounds over the last few decades , see @xcite , but the only rigorous attempt to derive a modified reynolds equation for elastohydrodynamic lubrication based upon these equations seems to have been carried out by rajagopal and szeri @xcite , see also @xcite for further applications of their model .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new modified reynolds equation for hydrodynamic lubrication in high pressure regimes .",
    "our approach is built upon an asymptotic expansion of the non - dimensional velocity and pressure fields in terms of a small dimensionless parameter @xmath0 , related to the film thickness , and on a systematic analysis of the simplified set of equations obtained at different orders of @xmath0 , see @xcite for a similar approach in the isoviscous case .",
    "assuming that the dimensionless pressure - viscosity coefficient is of order @xmath0 , we show that the pressure distribution is governed by a reynolds equation modified by a term depending , in particular , on the square of the shear rate . in @xcite",
    ", the authors assumed , for simplicity , that the cross - film pressure vanishes and derived a modified reynolds equation , similar to ours , but depending on the elongation rate .",
    "our computations show that it is exactly the ( lower - order ) cross - film pressure which is responsible for the new modified term in the reynolds equation .",
    "we also prove that for smaller values of the pressure - viscosity coefficient the traditional modification of the reynolds equation is a very accurate approximation of the pressure field .",
    "it has been argued that the behavior of a piezoviscous fluid can not be adequately described by a reynolds type equation if the principal shear stress @xmath1 is not less than the reciprocal of the pressure - viscosity coefficient @xmath2 , cf .",
    "this is not surprising since problems of nonexistence and nonuniqueness are expected for the full balance of linear momentum equations if @xmath3 , cf .",
    "similar conclusions can also be drawn from our modified reynolds equations which ceases to be elliptic if the shear stress times the pressure - viscosity coefficient is larger than , or of the order of , one .    in the piezoviscous regime , the pressure - dependence of viscosity can be modeled through the barus relation ( barus @xcite ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the dynamic viscosity measured at the ambient pressure ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath2 is a positive parameter related to the rate of change of viscosity with respect to pressure , often referred to as the pressure - viscosity coefficient .",
    "the barus relationship , together with the roelands formula ( roelands @xcite ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 pa s , @xmath9 pa and @xmath10 is a dimensionless parameter usually adjusted at ambient pressure to the barus relation through the equation @xmath11 are the most widely used models in elastohydrodynamic lubrication . for applications of these and other experimentally validated formulas for the variation of viscosity with pressure ,",
    "temperature and density , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in general , the pressure - viscosity coefficient @xmath2 depends on the lubricant , and on the pressure , temperature and shear rate in the contact area , cf .",
    "@xcite . for different lubricant oils ,",
    "its value has been shown to vary between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , cf .  @xcite .",
    "if the constant @xmath10 in the roelands formula is computed from equation , then both the barus and the roelands relation give @xmath14 .",
    "we stress that although we rely on the assumption that the viscosity @xmath15 varies with pressure @xmath16 according to the barus or roelands formula , our computations hold for more general pressure - viscosity relationships for which @xmath17 is of the order of @xmath0 or smaller .    before concluding this introductory section , it is worthwhile recognizing a marked departure of the constitutive relation of a piezoviscous fluid from that of the classical incompressible navier  stokes fluid with constant viscosity .",
    "while the latter is described by an explicit constitutive function for the stress in terms of the symmetric part of the velocity gradient , the former is an implicit relationship for the cauchy stress and the symmetric part of the velocity gradient , leading to a totally different structure to the equations governing the flows of such fluids which in turn raises interesting issues with regard to both the mathematical and numerical analysis of the governing equations .",
    "a one - dimensional rate - type implicit model to describe the non - newtonian response of fluids was introduced by burgers @xcite .",
    "his model includes as a special case the pioneering model to describe the viscoelastic response of fluids that was advanced by maxwell @xcite .",
    "maxwell s model is however not an implicit model as the symmetric part of the velocity gradient can be expressed explicitly in terms of the stress and the time rate of the stress .",
    "oldroyd @xcite developed a systematic procedure to generate properly invariant three - dimensional rate type implicit constitutive relations .",
    "such fluid models can be used to describe the flow of viscoelastic fluids and it is our aim to generalize the type of approximation that is being carried out here to include rate type implicit constitutive relations .",
    "consider the following equations governing the isothermal flow of an incompressible , homogeneous , viscous fluid @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the constant density of the fluid , @xmath20 is the velocity field and @xmath16 is a scalar variable , often referred to as the mechanical pressure , associated with the incompressibility constraint . moreover ,",
    "we have assumed above that the stress response is linear in the symmetric part of the velocity gradient , @xmath21 , with the viscosity @xmath15 depending ( in isothermal conditions ) only on the pressure @xmath16 , so that the stress tensor @xmath22 reads as @xmath23 ignoring the body force @xmath24 and limiting oneself to steady motions , equations ",

    "let us assume , for expediency , that the viscosity depends on the pressure through the barus relation . introducing the non - dimensionalized ( starred ) quantities @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent typical length and velocity scales and the characteristic pressure",
    "is taken to be @xmath33 we can rewrite equations  as @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the usual reynolds number .",
    "note that , had we defined @xmath2 more generally through @xmath36 the form of the nondimensional system  would still remain the same .",
    "let us restrict our attention to two - dimensional plane flows @xmath37 so that equations  can be recast as @xmath38 we make the following assumptions    * the flow takes place between two almost parallel surfaces situated at @xmath39 and @xmath40 ; * curvature of the surfaces can be neglected ; * the lubrication film is thin , that is , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denotes a small non - dimensional parameter ; * the characteristic lengths in @xmath43- and @xmath44-directions scale as @xmath45 ; * the flow is slow enough or the viscosity high enough so that @xmath46 ; * the scaled viscosity is of the order of one , that is @xmath47 .",
    "+ choosing @xmath46 we end up neglecting the inertial effects from the outset , as usual in deriving the reynolds approximation . at the same time , we simplify our presentation .",
    "in fact , given that the main pressure approximation is not affected by the inertial effects for reynolds numbers up to the order @xmath48 , cf .",
    "@xcite for computations in the constant - viscosity case , this simplification seems entirely warranted .",
    "+ as for the assumption @xmath47 , it is essential for the dimension reduction and , therefore , for the existence of a reynolds type equation .",
    "it may not hold at the highest pressure regimes but , then again , for pressures higher than 0.5 gpa the entire viscosity - pressure relationships given by the barus or roelands formula becomes questionable , cf .",
    "@xcite .    redefining the @xmath44-variable as @xmath49 and dropping the stars in  , yields the system @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the velocities of the parallel plates",
    ". we will write @xmath53 and assume that @xmath54 where the functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 and the parameter @xmath57 are of @xmath58 .",
    "there is still one dimensionless parameter , @xmath2 , whose order has not been discussed . in the thinnest - film ( elastohydrodynamic )",
    "lubrication problems , @xmath0 is of the order @xmath59 or smaller , and the size of @xmath2 should be taken to be of the order of @xmath0 but in thicker film problems the order of the pressure - viscosity coefficient is @xmath60 or smaller .",
    "we will consider these two cases separately .      substituting the asymptotic expressions  in equations ",
    ", writing @xmath62 where @xmath63 , and keeping only the terms of the highest order , we obtain , at order @xmath64 in and , at order @xmath65 in and at order @xmath66 in and @xmath67 equations , and , show that @xmath68 it then follows from and that @xmath69    the next order equations read as @xmath70 the one - dimensional oseen problem  for @xmath71 is solvable if and only if the compatibility condition @xmath72 is satisfied .",
    "this condition can be written as @xmath73 multiplying by @xmath74 and integrating across the film , yields @xmath75 using in leads to the modified reynolds equation @xmath76 = \\frac{h^\\prime}{2}(u^h - u^0)\\ , .\\ ] ]      at the first order , we simply have @xmath78 from  it again follows that @xmath79 .",
    "equation then yields @xmath80 , i.e.  the cross - film pressure also vanishes at this order .",
    "therefore @xmath81 at the next order , we find that @xmath82 the one - dimensional stokes problem  for @xmath71 is solvable if and only if @xmath83 substituting into , yields @xmath84 which can be written as the classical reynolds equation @xmath85    at the next order , we obtain the following system for @xmath86 @xmath87 the one - dimensional stokes problem  is solvable if and only if @xmath88 on the other hand , from , and one concludes that @xmath89 this yields @xmath90 we thus conclude that the reynolds equation provides a very accurate approximation for the pressure when @xmath77 or smaller .",
