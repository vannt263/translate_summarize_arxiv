    "we summarise this work here plus more recent developments  @xcite .",
    "heavy - ion observables accessible to measurement with cms include :    * `` soft '' observables  @xcite : charged hadron multiplicity ( @xmath4 ) , inclusive identified hadron spectra ( @xmath5 ) and elliptic flow ( @xmath6 parameter ) ; which provide constraints on the collective properties ( entropy density , viscosity , ... ) of the produced strongly interacting medium . * perturbative probes  @xcite : quarkonia , heavy - quarks , jets , @xmath2-jet and high-@xmath1 hadrons ; which are produced very early in the collision , are potentially modified while traversing the medium , and thus yield `` tomographic '' information ( colour density , @xmath7 transport coefficient , critical energy density , ... ) of the hottest and densest phases of the reaction .    the lhc will open a new frontier in the study of qcd matter , thanks to the large energy densities attainable , @xmath8  10  gev/@xmath9 at initial times  =  1  fm / c , is 200 times larger than the crossing - time of the two nuclei at lhc energies : @xmath10  fm / c . ]",

    "the cms detector is a 22 m ( length ) @xmath17 15 m ( diameter ) apparatus ( 12500 tons in weight ) featuring a 4 t solenoid surrounding central silicon pixel and microstrip tracking detectors and electromagnetic ( @xmath18 3 ) and hadronic ( @xmath18 5 ) calorimeters .",

    "the detector can thus perfectly deal with the large particle multiplicities anticipated for pb - pb  collisions at 5.5 tev , where the luminosity is 7 orders of magnitude smaller ( @xmath24@xmath22s@xmath23 ) .",
    "+ a key aspect of the cms capabilities for heavy - ion physics  in particular to fully exploit the rare probes available at the lhc  is its unparalleled high - level - trigger ( hlt ) system running on a filter farm with an equivalent of @xmath25(10@xmath14 ) 1.8  ghz cpu units , yielding few tens of tflops  @xcite .",
    "the hlt system is powerful enough to run `` offline '' algorithms on _ every single _ pb - pb event delivered by the level-1 trigger , and select the interesting events while reducing the data stream from an average 3  khz l1 input / output event rate down to 10100 hz written to permanent storage .",
