    "recent phenomenological observations show that the expansion of our universe is accelerating @xcite , which implies that our universe will look like de sitter(ds ) spacetimes that have energies dominated by a negative pressure such as cosmological constant or quintessence . a model of black holes corresponding to this universe",
    "can be considered , which is described by the einstein - hilbert action with a positive cosmological constant , and the static and neutral solution in this system has been known as a schwarzschild - de sitter(ssds ) black hole . in this family of black holes ,",
    "the size of black hole varies from zero to its cosmological limitation and then the spacetimes where we live are confined within the cosmological horizon .",
    "recently , hawking et .",
    "al . have studied black holes with the cosmological horizon in refs .",
    "if the size of the black hole is much smaller than that of the cosmological horizon , the radiation coming from the cosmological horizon is negligible compared to that from the black hole horizon , and the effective radiation experienced by observers is similar to the case of schwarzschild(ss ) black holes since the thermal temperature from black hole horizon @xmath0 is greater than that from cosmological horizon @xmath1 .",
    "so the black hole will radiate more than what it receives , and there exists an energy transfer from the black hole horizon @xmath2 to the cosmological horizon @xmath3 . finally , the black hole horizon becomes to shrink completely while the cosmological horizon grows faster until the black hole disappears to evaporate out .",
    "furthermore , the thermodynamic instability for this case has been investigated in ref .",
    "for the black hole which grows up to the same size of the cosmological horizon , the radiation coming from cosmological horizon equals to the black hole radiation , and it will be in the thermal equilibrium .",
    "for the nearly degenerate case , if the black hole horizon is shrunk from its equilibrium value , the size of black hole increases by `` anti - evaporation '' while the black hole evaporates when we choose a different type of initial perturbations which corresponds to a kind of `` push '' in the radiation bath .",
    "on the other hand , it would be interesting to study scattering amplitudes of the scalar field on the ssds black hole background since the greybody factor or the decay rate is closely related to the thermal temperature of black holes .",
    "some studies on these quantities in terms of the low energy perturbation method have been done for the four - dimensional kerr - newman(kn ) black holes @xcite and the kerr - newman - de sitter(kn - ds ) black hole without considering observers @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall study on the scattering amplitudes of the massive scalar field on the ssds black hole background by using the low energy perturbation theory .",
    "we consider a small black hole whose size is much smaller than that of the cosmological horizon and assume that the energy of probing fields @xmath4 , is negligible compared to the inverse of each horizon . in this configuration , the whole spacetimes can be approximately divided by two parts - ss black hole and ds spacetimes , and then the massive scalar field equation is easily solved on each background .",
    "finally , the scattering problem in ssds background can be solved by matching coefficients between asymptotic and near horizon solutions , and defining reflection coefficients .",
    "in addition , the temperatures from the two horizons can be obtained as `` minimal '' values of statistical thermal temperatures derived from the reflection coefficients . in sec .",
    "ii , we present a model of einstein - hilbert action with the negative cosmological constant , which shows two characteristic properties - ss black hole and ds spacetimes , and set up the static configuration of this model .",
    "section iii and iv contain the specific calculation of low energy perturbation in the attraction dominant region and the expansion dominant region . as a result ,",
    "the expected thermal temperatures at both regions are obtained by using the appropriate boundary condition and coefficient matching procedure . in sec .",
    "v , some discussions on the fine - tuning of amplitudes between different two regions and thermodynamic behaviors of non - degenerate and degenerate cases are briefly presented .",
    "we start with a four - dimensional einstein - hilbert action with a cosmological constant @xmath5 , which is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a gravitational constant and we set @xmath8 . from eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) , the neutral and static solution for the spherically symmetric einstein equation is described by the ssds black hole metric @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a unit line element of two - sphere , and @xmath12 is a black hole mass .",
    "note that two horizons @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath13 ) are only possible for @xmath14 . in this spacetime",
    ", there exits a two - spherical hypersurface where the gravitational attraction and cosmological expansion balance out exactly , so a geodesic orbit is defined as the position where observers need no acceleration in order to stay . from eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) , the geodesic orbit is located at @xmath15 with a normalized killing vector at this hypersurface .",
    "note that it is similar to the case of an observer who lives at infinity for the ss black hole .",
    "we can divide our whole spacetimes into specific four regions as shown in the fig .",
    "( [ fig : ssds ] ) . with the assumption of @xmath16 ,",
    "as @xmath17 goes to the black hole horizon @xmath2 , the ss black hole metric is prominent in the attraction dominant region ( region ( i ) and ( ii ) ) in as @xmath18 while if we are in the expansion dominant region ( region ( iii ) and ( iv ) ) which is accomplished by @xmath19 , the metric ( [ u(r ) ] ) behaves as like a ds metric @xmath20 note that the metric element ( [ u(r ) ] ) is a patch of eqs .",

    "a field equation can be solved and the corresponding amplitudes of solutions between the four regions will be matched exactly .",
    "then we define a reflection coefficient as a ratio between ingoing and outgoing fluxes in region ( ii ) and region ( iii ) , and finally obtain the scattering amplitudes and thermal temperatures coming from these two horizons .",

    "now let us discuss about the qualitative behaviors of non - degenerate and nearly degenerate cases of ssds black holes . as mentioned above ,",
    "our whole calculations have been done by assuming that the black hole horizon size is much smaller than that of the cosmological horizon , which describes a small ssds black hole .",
    "since the black hole will be hotter than the cosmological horizon , the one will evaporate faster than the other , and the black hole horizon will disappear at the end of evaporation .",
    "and then the ssds spacetimes may become the pure ds spacetimes at the end of the evaporation . at this stage ,",
    "one may ask a question : _ `` after evaporation at final stage , is it really possible to transit from the ssds spacetimes to the ds ones ? '' _ in fact , to answer this question explicitly , one should study this model with the gravitational back reaction by using the time evolution of the small ssds black hole , however we do not discuss anymore because of complexity of this analysis .    on the other hand , we naturally consider the degenerate case of horizons that the black hole horizon is equal to the cosmological horizon . in this case",
    ", we expect that the black hole will be in the thermal equilibrium state since the black hole and cosmological horizons have the same surface gravity .",
    "therefore , when the black hole horizon ( @xmath2 ) approaches to the cosmological horizon ( @xmath3 ) , the two @xmath144 hypersufaces ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) meet each other in a hypersurface ( @xmath21 ) , and this is somewhat trivial to discuss . to investigate the small perturbation from the thermal equilibrium , we can consider the nearly degenerate case whose metric is given by @xmath145 with defining new time and radial coordinates @xmath146 and @xmath147 by @xmath148 and @xmath149 , where @xmath150 . and the temperatures from two horizons are given by ref .",
