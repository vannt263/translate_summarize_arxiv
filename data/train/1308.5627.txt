    "ever since the discovery of the cosmic acceleration found by the observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) in 1998 @xcite , an exotic energy component dubbed as dark energy with negative pressure which contributes about 72% to the total energy density in the universe has been proposed .",
    "alternatively , modified theories of gravity such as the dvali - gabadadze - porrati model @xcite , f(r ) gravity @xcite , drgt ghost - free massive gravity @xcite , are also used to explain the cosmic acceleration .",
    "although the cosmological constant is the simplest candidate for dark energy and is consistent with current observations , dynamical dark energy models such as the quintessence model @xcite are also explored due to the many orders of magnitude discrepancy between the theoretical estimation and astronomical observations for the cosmological constant .",
    "for a recent review of dark energy , please see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the nature of dark energy is still unknown and a self - consistent dark energy theory is still unavailable , current observational data provides us the only possible way to probe the nature of dark energy . a lot of analyses by using the observational data have been done in the literature .",
    "in particular , one usually parameterizes the equation of state parameter @xmath3 of dark energy with several parameters , such as the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization @xmath4 with two parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite and the sslcpl model with explicit degeneracy relation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "because of the degeneracies among the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the model , complementary cosmological observations are needed to break the degeneracies . the measurements on the cosmic microwave background anisotropy , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurements and the sne ia observations provide complementary data .",
    "recently , _ planck _ released its first year results which give a higher value of fractional matter energy density @xmath7 and a lower value of the hubble constant @xmath8 km@xmath9s@xmath10@xmath9mpc@xmath10   for the concordance @xmath2cdm model @xcite .",
    "however , tammannk _ et al _ gave a lower value @xmath11(random)@xmath12(systematic ) km@xmath9s@xmath10@xmath9mpc@xmath10 by using the cepheid - calibrated luminosity of sne ia @xcite which differs at about @xmath13 from the result @xmath14 km@xmath9s@xmath10@xmath9mpc@xmath10 by calibrating the magnitude - redshift relation of 253 sne ia with over 600 cepheid variables @xcite due to the difference of the calibration of zero points . applying the revised geometric maser distance to ngc 4258 to the same cepheid data used in @xcite , the hubble constant was lowered to be @xmath15 km@xmath9s@xmath10@xmath9mpc@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "if strong metallicity prior was imposed and three different distance anchors were combined , the hubble constant was measured as @xmath16 km@xmath9s@xmath10@xmath9mpc@xmath10 @xcite . by measuring the time delays between multiple images of lensed sources with free - form modelling of gravitational lenses , the hubble constant was determined to be @xmath17(statistic)@xmath12(systematic ) km@xmath9s@xmath10@xmath9mpc@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it seems that the calibration of zero point of sne ia data is still a controversial issue .",

    "result disagrees with the local measurements at about @xmath18 level .",
    "the _ planck _",
    "group argued that the tension came either from some sources of unknown systematic errors in some astrophysical measurements or the wrong @xmath2cdm model applied in fitting the data @xcite . despite of the tension on @xmath0 for the concordance @xmath2cdm model between the _",
    "constraint and the local distance ladder measurements with sne ia data , the _ planck _",
    "result is consistent with the results from bao data @xcite and the hubble parameter @xmath19 data @xcite .",
    "this excludes the possibility that the tension is due to the different redshift regions covered by different data . in @xcite",
    ", the authors found that some of the tensions come from the 217 ghz@xmath20217 ghz detector set spectrum , and they found @xmath21 and @xmath22 km@xmath9s@xmath10@xmath9mpc@xmath10 by using a map - based foreground cleaning procedure . by considering the effect of the cosmic variance on the measurement of the local hubble constant @xcite or additional sterile neutrinos @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the tension can be partially relieved .",
    "for the concordance @xmath2cdm model , the best fitting value from the three year supernova legacy survey ( snls3 ) sne ia data @xcite is @xmath23 @xcite , and the constraint by the union2.1 sne ia data is @xmath24 @xcite . with the improved photometric calibration of 740 sne ia ( jla data ) obtained from the joint analysis of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)-ii and snls collaborations @xcite",
    ", the constraint becomes @xmath25 which is consistent with both union2.1 and the _ planck _ results .",
    "it seems that the tension on @xmath1 between the snls3 sne ia constraint and the _ planck _ constraint ( at about @xmath26 level ) is due to the systematics of the calibration of the snls3 sne ia data , so no such tension from different measurements exists",
    ".    however , for different data it is still worthy studying the dependence of the parameter constraints on dynamical dark energy models and their consistencies with @xmath2cdm model . for the dark energy model with constant equation of state ( @xmath27cdm model ) , _ planck _ data alone gave @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite which is in tension with the flat @xmath2cdm model with @xmath31 at more than @xmath32 level . if the @xmath0 prior is combined with _",

    "we would like to address the issue whether the tension can be relieved by using the dynamical dark energy models .    in this paper",
    ", we first apply a one parameter sslcpl model with explicit relation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 which models a wide class of thawing scalar field over a large redshift region , then we use the cpl parametrization with the 8 bao data @xcite and the 21 hubble parameter @xmath19 data @xcite in combination of three different sne ia samples : the snls3 sample of 472 sne ia data @xcite , the union2.1 sample of 580 sne ia data @xcite , and the jla sample of 780 sne ia data from the joint analysis of snls and sdss - ii collaborations @xcite , and the cosmic microwave background anisotropy data from the combination of _ planck _ temperature power spectrum with the wmap polarization low - multipole likelihood data @xcite .",
    "the snls3 sne ia data consist of 123 low - redshift sne ia with @xmath38 mainly from calan / tololo , the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics ( cfa ) survey releases cfai , cfaii and cfaiii , and carnegie supernova project ( csp ) , 242 sne ia over the redshift range @xmath39 observed from the snls @xcite , 93 intermediate - redshift sne ia with @xmath40 observed during the first season of sdss - ii supernova survey @xcite , and 14 high - redshift sne ia with @xmath41 from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) @xcite .",
    "the snls3 sne ia data used the combination of salt2 and sifto light - curve fitters @xcite .",
    "we also include the correction on the dependence of the host - galaxy stellar mass .",
    "for the fitting to the snls3 data , we need to add two more nuisance parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 which characterize the stretch - luminosity and color - luminosity relations in addition to the model parameters and the nuisance parameter @xmath44 which accounts for some combination of the absolute magnitude of a fiducial sn ia and the hubble constant .",
    "because the nuisance parameter @xmath44 incorporates the absolute magnitude and the hubble constant , and the normalization of the magnitude is arbitrary , so we marginalize over it in the sne ia data fitting process , and @xmath0 is not a fitting parameter for the sne ia data .",
    "the jla sample combines the data from snls3 and three years of the sdss - ii sne survey with the joint light - curve analysis by the sdss - ii and snls collaborations , and it includes a total of 740 spectroscopically confirmed sne ia with the improved photometric calibration @xcite . for the fitting to the jla data , we also need to add two more nuisance parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
