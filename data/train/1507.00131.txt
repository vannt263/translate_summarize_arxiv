    "information - theoretical limits of wireless networks have been studied extensively in the past and it has been demonstrated that cooperation between nodes in wireless networks can substantially increase the channel capacity . indeed , theoretical findings suggest that throughput gains of up to two orders of magnitude are obtainable by exploiting techniques such as coordinated multi - point ( comp ) , network multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) or interference alignment ( ia ) , provided that the communicating nodes have access to the fading coefficients in the network @xcite .",
    "knowledge of these fading coefficients is usually referred to as _ channel - state information ( csi ) _ , and the assumption that the nodes have perfect knowledge of the fading coefficients is usually referred to as _",
    "perfect csi_. however , it is _ prima facie _ unclear whether perfect csi can be obtained in practical systems .",
    "in fact , over - the - air trials have only demonstrated disappointingly low throughput improvements ( not exceeding 30% in some scenarios ) @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate the channel capacity of wireless networks when the nodes neither have perfect csi nor do they perform a channel estimation to obtain information on the fading coefficients .",
    "this is relevant , e.g. , if the nodes do not have the computational resources to perform an accurate channel estimation .",
    "moreover , in dense wireless networks , where many nodes share the same resources , an accurate channel estimation may not be feasible , even if the nodes have sufficient computing power .",
    "our work is along the lines of the work by lozano , heath , and andrews @xcite . indeed , lozano et al .",
    "argued that cooperation can have severe limitations in the sense that the channel capacity for wireless networks can be bounded in the signal - to - noise ( snr ) .",
    "in other words , cooperation can not convert an interference - limited network into a noise - limited one .",
    "the main results in @xcite are based on the analysis of a block - fading channel that models the channel within a cluster and takes out - of - cluster interference into account .",
    "specifically , in @xcite two analyses are carried out :    * the analysis of a block - fading channel in a clustered system with pilot - assisted channel estimation and out - of - cluster interference that has a gaussian distribution and grows linearly with the snr .",
    "due to this dependence of the interference on the snr , the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) is bounded in the snr , resulting in the capacity being bounded in the snr , too . *",
    "the analysis of a fully cooperative system , where all transmitters and all receivers cooperate , resulting effectively in mimo transmission .",
    "it is assumed that the number of transmitters is greater than the number of time instants @xmath0 over which the block - fading channel stays constant .",
    "this precludes an accurate channel estimation . for this scenario ,",
    "the maximum achievable rate is studied when the time-@xmath1 channel input is of the form @xmath2 ( where the distribution of @xmath3 does not depend on the snr ) , and it is demonstrated that this rate is bounded in the snr .    for both analyses",
    "the conclusions are the same : in the absence of perfect csi , the capacity of wireless networks is bounded in the snr , hence , transmission over such networks is highly power - inefficient .",
    "this accentuates the limitation of cooperation in wireless networks .",
    "however , the analyses by lozano et al .  are based on simplifying assumptions that weaken their conclusions .",
    "indeed , in the former analysis of a clustered system with pilot - assisted channel estimation , the authors assume that the interference has a gaussian distribution , which seems pessimistic .",
    "indeed , it is well - known that the capacity of the additive - noise channel is minimized , among all power - constrained noise distributions , by _ identically and independently distributed ( i.i.d . ) _ gaussian noise @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this result has been generalized to wireless networks @xcite .",
    "note , however , that gaussian noise does not constitute the worst - case scenario when the input distribution is not gaussian ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "based on the above observations , it may seem plausible that also for the considered channel model , gaussian interference is the worst - case interference . since the distribution of the interference depends on the distribution of the symbols transmitted by the interfering nodes , one may argue that the capacity may be unbounded if the interferers would use codebooks that give rise to non - gaussian interference .    as for the latter analysis of a fully cooperative system , here",
    "the authors assume that the time-@xmath1 channel inputs are of the form @xmath4 , where @xmath3 has a distribution that does not depend on the snr .",
    "one may argue that the corresponding information rate is bounded in the snr because of the suboptimal input distribution and not because of the limitations of cooperation .",
    "in fact , it has been demonstrated by lapidoth and moser in ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.3 ) that for a memoryless channel and in the absence of perfect csi such inputs give rise to a bounded information rate also in the point - to - point case . for noncoherent point - to - point memoryless fading channels ,",
    "an input distribution that changes with the snr is thus necessary in order to achieve an unbounded information rate . since the block - fading channel specializes to the memoryless fading channel when @xmath5 , the observation that channel inputs of the form @xmath6 yield a bounded information rate is perhaps not very surprising .    in this work",
    ", we explore whether the capacity of noncoherent wireless networks is still bounded in the snr if we allow the input distribution to depend on the snr .",
    "in contrast to the analysis by lozano et al .",
    "@xcite , we assume for the sake of simplicity that the nodes do not cooperate . we do not know whether cooperation would give rise to an unbounded capacity . for simplicity",
    ", we further consider a flat - fading channel with an infinite number of interferers .",
    "the locations of these interferers enter the channel model through the variance of the fading coefficients corresponding to the paths between the interferers and the intended receiver . without loss of generality",
    ", we order the interferers with respect to the variances of the corresponding fading coefficients : the fading coefficient of the first interferer has the largest variance , denoted by @xmath7 , the fading coefficient of the second interferer has the second - largest variance , denoted by @xmath8 , and so on .",
    "we consider a noncoherent scenario where transmitter and receiver are cognizant of the statistics of the fading coefficients , but are ignorant of their realization .",
    "we demonstrate that the observation by lozano et al .  continues to hold even if the input distribution is allowed to depend on the snr , provided that the sequence of variances @xmath9 decays at most exponentially and each interfering node transmits symbols that follow the same distribution as the symbols transmitted by the transmitting node . to this end",
    ", we derive an upper bound on the channel capacity that is bounded in the snr .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the channel model .",
    "section iii is devoted to channel capacity and the main result of our work .",
    "section iv shows an upper bound on the channel capacity for the special case in which the variances of the channel coefficients decay exponentially .",
    "section v contains the proof of our main result .",
    "section vi concludes the paper with a summary and discussion of the results .",
    "0.45     0.45     0.45     a network is composed of a number of users that are communicating with each other .",
    "a possible scenario is depicted in figure  [ fig : network_1 ] , where @xmath10 transmitting nodes ( denoted in the figure by  a \" ) communicate with @xmath11 receiving nodes ( denoted by  b \" ) .",
    "this network is sometimes referred to as an _ interference network_. for simplicity , we assume that the set of transmitting nodes and the set of receiving nodes are disjoint and both the transmitting nodes and the receiving nodes do not cooperate .    since a characterization of all achievable rates in the network is unfeasible when the number of nodes is large , it is common to study the _ sum - rate capacity _ of the network , which is defined as the supremum of the sum of all achievable rates in the network .",
    "however , it is _ prima facie _ unclear whether the transmission strategy that achieves the sum - rate capacity will also be optimal in practice .",
    "indeed , it may well be that the optimal transmission strategy consists of turning off all but one of the transmitting nodes , thereby minimizing the interference",
    ". such a strategy prevents @xmath12 nodes from transmitting anything and is probably not very practical .",
    "in fact , practical constraints may demand that each node is offered roughly the same transmission rate or , at least , a transmission rate that is above a given threshold . in order to enforce such a solution , one could study the sum - rate capacity of the network under the constraint that all transmitting nodes transmit at the same rate , but obtaining an expression for such a capacity seems challenging . to model the problem in a way that it can be analyzed analytically ,",
    "we simplify the original problem as follows :    firstly , we consider the case where one transmitting node communicates with one receiving node and the interfering nodes emit symbols that interfer with this communication ; see figure ( [ fig : network_2 ] ) . to model a large network",
    ", we assume that there are an infinite number of interfering nodes .",
    "as performance measure we consider the capacity of the channel between the transmitting and receiving node . secondly , to avoid transmission strategies for which the interfering nodes are turned off ( which would , in fact , maximize the capacity ) , we assume that the symbols transmitted by the interfering nodes must follow the same distribution as the symbols transmitted by the transmitting node . by the channel coding theorem @xcite , this implies that each node ( transmitting and interfering ) is transmitting at the same rate , while at the same time it keeps the analysis accessible .",
    "note that , while the above simplifications permit a mathematical analysis of the channel capacity of the network , they are more restrictive than the analysis of the sum - rate capacity under the constraint that all nodes transmit at the same rate .",
    "indeed , one can find transmission strategies for which each node transmits at the same rate , but the symbols produced by them do not follow the same distribution .",
    "one such strategy would be time - division multiple access ( tdma ) , where only one pair of nodes communicates with each other and the other nodes remain silent , and where the pairs of communicating nodes change after a given period until all nodes have transmitted their data .",
    "clearly , in this case a node that transmits data produces symbols that follow a different distribution than the symbols emitted by silent nodes ( for which the symbol transmitted at time @xmath1 is equal to zero ) .",
    "thus , our constraint that all nodes shall produce symbols that follow the same distribution precludes , e.g. , strategies such as tdma .",
    "that said , the rates achievable with tdma vanish as the number of users in the network tends to infinity , so in a large network tdma seems not very attractive anyway .",
    "we model the channel between the transmitting and receiving node by a discrete - time flat - fading channel whose complex - valued output @xmath13 at time @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 denotes the set of integers ) corresponding to the time-@xmath1 channel input @xmath3 and the time-@xmath1 interfering symbols @xmath16 , @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 here @xmath19 models the time-@xmath1 additive noise ; @xmath20 denotes the time-@xmath1 fading coefficient of the channel between the transmitter and receiver ; and @xmath21 , @xmath17 denotes the time-@xmath1 fading coefficient of the link between the @xmath22-th interfering node and the receiver ; see figure ( [ fig : ourchannel ] ) .",
    "we assume that the sequences @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , @xmath17 are all sequences of i.i.d .",
    "complex random variables that they are independent of each other .",
    "we further assume that @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 for some @xmath29 , where we use the notation @xmath30 to indicate that @xmath31 is a circularly - symmetric , complex gaussian random variable of mean @xmath32 and variance @xmath33 ( @xmath34 denotes the set of complex numbers ) .",
    "we consider a noncoherent scenario where transmitter and receiver are cognizant of the statistics of the fading coefficients , but are ignorant of their realization .",
    "we assume that the interfering nodes do neither cooperate with each other nor with the transmitting node .",
    "this implies that the sequences @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath17 are independent of each other . since we also demand",
    "that each node produces symbols according to the same distribution , this implies that @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath17 are also identically distributed .",
    "note , however , that this does not mean that the sequences of transmitted symbols are i.i.d .  in time  to compute the capacity we will optimize over all distributions of @xmath35 that satisfy the power constraint .    without loss of generality , we assume that the interfering nodes are ordered according to the variances of the corresponding fading coefficients , i.e. , @xmath37 for any @xmath38 .",
    "we further assume that there exists a @xmath39 such that @xmath40 the condition states that the variances of the fading coefficients corresponding to the interfering nodes decay at most exponentially .",
    "if we relate these variances to the path losses between the receiving node and the interfering nodes , then essentially requires that the distance between neighboring interfering nodes grows at most exponentially as we move farther away from the receiving node .",
    "we believe that this assumption is reasonably mild .",
    "we shall denote sequences such as @xmath41 by @xmath42 .",
    "we further denote by @xmath43 the limit superior .",
    "we define the capacity of the above channel as @xmath44 where we assume that the sequences @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath17 are independent of each other and that each such sequence has distribution @xmath47 .",
    "this is consistent with the simplifying assumptions introduced in section  [ channelmodel ] .",
    "the supremum in is over all @xmath10-dimensional , complex - valued , probability distributions @xmath47 satisfying the power constraint @xmath48 the @xmath49 is defined as @xmath50 we do not claim that there is a coding theorem associated with , i.e. , we do not claim that for any rate below @xmath51 there exists an encoding and decoding scheme for which the decoding error probability tends to zero as @xmath10 tends to infinity .",
    "( see @xcite for more details . ) however , by fano s inequality ( * ? ? ?",
    "7.9 ) , we do know that for any rate above @xmath51 there exists no such encoding and decoding scheme .",
    "thus , by demonstrating that @xmath51 is bounded in the @xmath52 , we also demonstrate that there exists no encoding and decoding scheme that has a rate that tends to infinity as @xmath53 and for which the decoding error probability vanishes as @xmath10 tends to infinity .",
    "our main result is the following .",
    "[ maintheorem ] for the channel model presented in section  [ channelmodel ] , the capacity is bounded in the snr , i.e. , @xmath54    see section  [ proof ] .",
    "thus , theorem  [ maintheorem ] demonstrates that if the nodes do not cooperate , if they emit symbols that all follow the same distribution , and if the variances of the fading coefficients satisfy , then the capacity is bounded in the snr , even if the distribution of the channel inputs is allowed to depend on the snr .",
    "this result is more general than the result by lozano et al.@xcite in the sense that we allow the distribution of the channel inputs to depend on the snr , but it is less general than @xcite in the sense that we assume that the variances of the fading coefficients , i.e. , @xmath9 , decay at most exponentially and that we do not allow cooperation between the nodes .",
    "the condition is satisfied , for example , if @xmath55 in general , we can say that if @xmath9 decays _ exponentially or more slowly _ ,",
    "then @xmath51 is bounded in the snr .",
    "this result is reminiscent of a result obtained by koch and lapidoth @xcite that states that the capacity of single - user , frequency - selective , noncoherent fading channels is bounded in the snr if the variances of the path gains decay exponentially or more slowly . note , however , that the proof given in section  [ proof ] is different from the one given in @xcite .    in order to prove the above result",
    ", we derive an upper bound on the capacity that does not depend on the snr .",
    "since this bound may also be of independent interest , we summarize it in the following proposition",
    ".    consider the channel model introduced in section  [ channelmodel ] .",
