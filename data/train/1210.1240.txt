    "therefore , if the goal is to engineer a stable oscillator , a roughly symmetric design is generally preferable .    however , the minimum of the boundary curve between the two asymptotic dynamical behaviors ( purple curve in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) does not correspond to the symmetric case ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "this result indicates that a symmetric system showing damped oscillations ( as it is generally the case for parameter values just below the boundary in fig .  [ fig6 ] )",

    "thus , a test of the effective symmetry of experimental repressilator realizations would entail measuring the oscillation amplitude of two fluorescently - tagged protein products of genes in the circuit .",

    "a growth - rate induced `` dynamical switch '' . _",
    "our results show that the dynamics is dependent on the growth rate in a fashion that is both qualitative and quantitative .",
    "specifically , a symmetric repressilator will lose its oscillatory state with increasing growth rate unless its is sufficiently high , and this phenomenology is expected to be observable in a wide range of experimentally accessible conditions .",
    "indeed , the growth - mediated switch between different dynamics shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] should be simple to observe experimentally , given the typical values of the parameters involved .",
    "the average protein copy numbers per cell span different orders of magnitude , from @xmath80 to @xmath81  @xcite , while the values for the dissociation constants have been reported to range between a few molecules  @xcite and a few thousands  @xcite . with these numbers , the values ( i.e. protein concentration at @xmath82 in units of @xmath24 ) analyzed here , such as @xmath83 in the example in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , are well in the physiological range .",
    "this suggests that a repressilator dynamics characterized by loss of the oscillatory behavior at a critical growth rate should , and that changes in both oscillation period and amplitude to be measurable experimentally .",

    "_ furthermore , the growth - rate dependent behavior of the circuit is it is embedded in , a plasmid or a chromosome , and for a chromosome on the detailed coordinates of the three promoters .",
    "[ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] suggest the stability of oscillatory behavior is more sensitive to variations in growth rate for a repressilator integrated on plasmids than on the chromosome , as plasmid copy number can be strongly growth - rate dependent ( as well as variable from cell to cell ) .",
    "however , integration on a high copy - number plasmid can naturally increase the protein concentration ( hence the `` promoter strength '' parameter defined ) , thus leading to more robust oscillations .",
    "therefore , if the goal is engineering a stable synthetic oscillator , there is probably a trade - off between the advantage of an increased typical of a high copy number plasmid , and the unavoidable plasmid - specific growth - rate dependence ( and cell - to - cell variability ) of the copy number  @xcite . on the other hand , for chromosomally integrated repressilators ,",
    "the dynamics depends nontrivially on gene position .",

    "_ role of noise .",
    "_ some relevant considerations can be made about the possible role of noise in the results given here within a purely deterministic framework . in general",
    ", noise can strongly affect the dynamics of a repressilator .",
    "for example , in the _ in vivo _ realization of the repressilator  @xcite only about @xmath84 of the cells displayed oscillations , with high cell - to - cell variability in oscillation period and amplitude .",
    "several studies have analyzed the possible impact of noise , focusing on the stochasticity that arises from the discrete nature of the molecular players and from the inherent randomness of their interactions ( together referred to as _ intrinsic noise _ )  @xcite .",
    "the main result is that intrinsic noise can both play a constructive role in oscillation robustness and a destructive one .",
    "the constructive phenomenon can enlarge the parameter space of oscillations through a resonance effect  @xcite .",
    "the destructive one causes strong cell - to - cell variability in oscillation amplitude and period  @xcite .    while intrinsic noise can be a relevant factor and",
    "could partially explain the experimentally observed variability , the dominant source of noise might be due to fluctuations in global cellular parameters ( _ extrinsic noise _ ) , such as ribosome or polymerases concentration .",
    "this has been shown to be the case in _",
    "e.  coli _ ,",
    "for relatively high expression ( more than approximately @xmath85 proteins per cell )  @xcite .",
    "since oscillations in the repressilator generally require strong promoters , the variability in the circuit dynamics is expected to be highly sensitive to the extrinsic noise level , which adds up , for plasmids , to the aforementioned cell - to - cell copy - number variation .",
    "these considerations point to an interest in considering the stochastic aspects of the circuit .",
    "however , in order to extend the mean - field model introduced here to analyze the growth rate dependence of the cell - to - cell variability of the repressilator dynamics , it would be necessary to know how the extrinsic noise scales with growth rate . unfortunately , there are no experimental data concerning this scaling , making the extension of this work to the stochastic case premature .",
    "nevertheless , the possibility of a switch between different dynamical regimes in response to the physiological cell state opens interesting considerations about the robustness of this oscillatory genetic circuit .",
    "fluctuations in physiological parameters such as the growth rate fall in the broadly - defined category of extrinsic noise .",
    "it has been suggested that fluctuations in the growth rate , mainly through its influence on protein dilution , can account for a considerable part of the measured extrinsic noise  @xcite .",
    "our analysis suggests that fluctuations in cell parameters linked to growth can introduce cell - to - cell variability in the circuit dynamics ( convergence to oscillation or to a stable fixed point ) as well as in oscillation period and amplitude .",

    "however , it is interesting to note that in the simple modeling framework adopted here , the period of oscillation decreases with growth rate without the need of specific additional regulation . in absence of overlapping replication rounds , this is exactly the kind of behavior desired for an oscillator regulating the triggering of dna replication , such as the dnaa circuit : a shortening of the initiation time is required when the cell volume grows faster to synchronize dna replication and volume doubling ( the situation becomes more complex at fast growth  @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , circadian clocks need to be resilient to changes in the cell doubling time , and thus in the growth rate , in order to keep a steady @xmath86-hour period in variable environmental conditions , and thus can not measure time using the cell cycle .",
    "the consequent decoupling between the cell cycle and the circadian rhythm has indeed been verified in cyanobacteria  @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that the dynamics of a genetic oscillator is naturally strongly connected to the cellular growth rate .",
    "therefore , specific regulatory mechanisms are required in order to compensate for these effects and render a circadian oscillator insulated from the growth state . although circadian clocks appear to be primarily based on post - translational circuits in bacteria  @xcite , the proteins involved are the result of a gene expression process , and thus in principle coupled with growth rate  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to evaluate experimentally if the promoters regulating these proteins are more buffered as a function of growth rate compared to others .",
    "quantitative models taking into account the parameter dependence on growth rate , such as the one presented here , may be important to pose the question of the growth - rate robustness of the circadian cycle .",
    "for example , the circuit architectures and the type of regulations selected by evolution to compose circadian oscillators might be , at least in part , constrained by the implementation of the observed growth - rate independence .    finally , from a synthetic biology standpoint , changing the conditions in which the cells are grown alters quantitatively the characteristics of the repressilator dynamics in a predictable manner .",
    "this offers the possibility of external control of the circuit behavior by simply operating on macroscopic variable related to physiology such as the type of nutrient supply or the temperature .",
    "this way , the engineering and control of the dynamics can be performed by tuning environmental conditions in a model - guided way , rather then by modifying the genetic components , which can be technically complex .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with vittore f. scolari , mina zarei and bianca sclavi .",
    "we thank matthew aa grant and carla bosia for critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "this work was supported by the the international human frontier science program organization ( grant rgy0069/2009-c ) .",
    "a common assumption in genetic circuit modeling is that the contribution of the cell - cycle dynamics can be neglected , at least when one is interested in time scales longer than the doubling time , which is often the case given the typical high protein stability .",
    "this approximation allows the use of effective parameters obtained averaging over the cell cycle .",
    "@xcite . however , as discussed in the text , the growth - rate dependences of gene expression parameters are derived from experimental observations of average cellular properties in a population  @xcite , which are also affected by the cell age distribution .",
    "this appendix the quantitative difference between population and cell - cycle averages for two quantities that are well characterized , the gene dosage due to dna replication and the cellular volume .",
    "we will show that in these two cases population averages can be used in dynamic models of genetic circuits without introducing significant errors .",
    "the assumption that this result can be generalized to other quantities justifies , although not rigorously , the use of available experimentally estimated population averages in dynamic models for those quantities whose time dependence ( or even cell - cycle averages ) are not known  @xcite .",
    "this is the case for ribosome or polymerase concentrations at different growth rates , which are crucial to determine the growth - rate dependence of transcription and translation rates in eq .",
    "[ constitutive ] .",
    "dna replication in fast - growing bacteria such as _",
    "e.  coli _ typically starts from a single replication origin ( ori ) and proceeds bidirectionally along the circular chromosome until it reaches the replication terminus ( ter ) .",
    "the cooper - helmstetter model  @xcite establishes the relation between growth rate and replication timing such that dna copies are produced on time for each newborn cell .",
    "the model is based on the empirical observation that the time necessary for chromosome replication ( called `` @xmath69 period '' ) and the time period between completion of chromosome replication and the following cell division ( @xmath87 period ) are approximately constant ( at least for fast - dividing cells  @xcite , with doubling times less than 1hr ) . since at time @xmath88 the cell divides , a time lag @xmath89 before initiation is necessary to make the total replication time @xmath90 an integer multiple of the doubling time @xmath40 , `` synchronizing '' dna replication and cell division .",
    "thus , the following relation has to be satisfied @xmath91 where @xmath92 $ ] is the integer number of times that @xmath40 divides @xmath88 . starting from this relation",
    ", it can be easily shown that the number of origins present at initiation is exactly @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "more generally , we can consider a gene at a chromosomal position defined by its normalized distance @xmath9 from ori , i.e. @xmath48 represents a gene in ori and @xmath49 in ter .",
    "the copy number of this gene , @xmath8 , changes during the cell cycle following @xmath94 where @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the gene dosage averaged over the cell cycle ( which could be measured following a single cell lineage and averaging over time ) , is given by @xmath96   \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , the population age structure must be taken into account when evaluating the average gene dosage in a cell population . for ideal `` balanced exponential '' growth with rate @xmath11 this distribution",

    "[ figapp ] , the difference between cell - cycle averages ( dashed blue lines ) and population averages ( red continuous lines ) in the physiological range of growth rates is negligible for all gene positions .",
    "similar considerations can be carried out in the case of the average cell volume .",
    "the functional form of the volume increase in time during a cell cycle has long been debated  @xcite , with two prevailing hypotheses of linear growth ( constant rate ) or exponential growth ( size - dependent rate ) , although more complex dependences have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments strongly suggest an exponential growth  @xcite , and we assumed this functional form ( note that the same reasoning could be applied to linear growth straightforwardly , so this choice has no consequences on any of the results ) . with a volume growth of the form @xmath99 , the mean volume over a cell cycle is @xmath100 , while the integration over the population leads to @xmath101 .",
    "all the volume growth - rate dependence is hidden in @xmath102 , and experimental results indicate that this dependence is approximately exponential  @xcite ."
