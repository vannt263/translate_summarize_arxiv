    "high - frequency devices are in demand for practical applications such as communication devices , magnetic sensors , and measurement systems .",
    "spin torque oscillator ( sto ) @xcite is a promising candidate for such applications because high - frequency signal on the order of gigahertz can be achieved through the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) or tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) effect . a small size on the order of nano - meter , a wide frequency tunability over than one gigahertz , and a narrow linewidth less than one megahertz are also preferable features for device applications . in particular ,",
    "an sto consisting of a perpendicularly magnetized free layer @xcite and an in - plane magnetized pinned layer has attracted much attention recently @xcite because the large relative angle of the magnetizations of the free and pinned layers results in a large emission power on the order of 1 @xmath0w @xcite .",
    "therefore , this type of sto is considered to be the model structure for practical applications .",
    "the self - oscillation of the magnetization in an sto is excited when several conditions , such as the direction and magnitude of an applied field , are satisfied @xcite . while general conditions to excite the self - oscillation had been formulated @xcite , the possibility to excite the self - oscillation has to be investigated for each problems by solving the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation .",
    "the number of theoretical works studying the conditions of the self - oscillation is few because of the complexity arising from the nonlinearity of the llg equation .",
    "for example , the oscillation properties of sto with the perpendicularly magnetized free layer and the in - plane magnetized pinned layer were theoretically studied only in the presence of a perpendicular field @xcite , in which the axial symmetry of the system reduces the difficulty to solve the llg equation . on the other hand ,",
    "it is still unclear whether the self - oscillation can be excited when the field direction is changed .",
    "it is practically important to investigate the possibility to excite self - oscillation in the presence of a field in a different direction due to the following reasons .",
    "for example in the sensor applications , an external magnetic field to be detected points to an arbitrary direction .",
    "thus , it is insufficient to study the oscillation properties in the presence of a perpendicular field only .",
    "another reason relates to the low power consumption .",
    "our previous work @xcite showed that the zero - field oscillation is impossible in this type of sto , and a relatively high field is necessary to stabilize the self - oscillation by a perpendicular field . discovering a method to excite a stable oscillation by a small field is therefore attractive from the viewpoint of reducing the power consumption of the sto .",
    "the change of the field direction might open a new possibility to this problem .    in this paper",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( a ) indicates that @xmath88 for @xmath89 , meaning that the second condition mentioned above is not satisfied .",

    "when @xmath90 , the condition @xmath71 is satisfied for the region where @xmath18 is less than a certain value , while @xmath91 diverges at this point .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( b ) diverges at @xmath92 for @xmath93 oe and @xmath94 for @xmath95 oe , respectively .",
    "these results imply that the self - oscillation can be excited by applying an electric current larger than @xmath96 , in which the precession amplitude increases with the increase of the current , and finally , saturates to a value corresponding to the energy at the divergence . the oscillation frequency given by eq .",

    "below , we show that this analytical prediction works well in the low current region , whereas a discrepancy between the analytical and numerical results appear in the large current region .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the breakdown of the assumption used in the averaged llg equation .",
    "the divergence of @xmath57 at a certain @xmath18 means that the net energy supplied by the spin torque during a precession , @xmath32 , becomes zero when the magnetization arrives at this constant energy curve .",
    "then , the spin torque can not balance the dissipation due to damping even when a large current is applied , which means @xmath97 . when @xmath87 , the condition @xmath71 is not satisfied , and thus the self - oscillation can not be excited .    to summarize the above discussion",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] ( c ) , works well in the relatively low current region , guaranteeing the validity of the theory . on the other hand ,",
    "a discrepancy between the analytical and numerical results is found in the high current region due to the following reason .",
    "the theory assumes that the averaged work done by spin torque and dissipation due to damping during a precession are equal in the self - oscillation state . at each point on the constant energy curve however , the magnitudes of the spin torque and the damping torque are not equal because the spin torque and the damping torque have different angular dependences . when the spin torque ( current ) magnitude or the damping constant is large , a shift from the constant energy curve becomes large , and thus the magnetization can not return to the constant energy curve during a precession .",
    "then , the assumption in the averaged llg equation does not stand , and the analytical theory is no more applicable to reproduce the numerical results .",
    "in fact , when the current density is @xmath105 a/@xmath70 , the magnetization does not show self - oscillation . in stead",
    ", it moves to @xmath106 direction , and stops its dynamics because of the large spin torque strength .",
    "therefore , the numerically obtained peak frequency in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ( c ) is zero .",
    "the above analytical and numerical results show that a stable self - oscillation can be excited when a magnetic field smaller than eq .",
    "( [ eq : critical_field ] ) is applied anti - parallel to the magnetization of the pinned layer .",
    "the oscillation frequency changes continuously by increasing the current magnitude .",
    "the analytical relation between the current and frequency , obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : frequency ] ) and ( [ eq : je ] ) , works well in the low current region . in a high current region",
    ", the magnetization eventually arrives at the film - plane , and stops its dynamics . in this section ,",
    "we compare these results with the previous works , and discuss the advantages to use the in - plane field .",
    "let us compare the present results with our previous work @xcite , where the oscillation properties in the presence of a perpendicular field along the @xmath107-axis were studied .",
    "it was shown that , when the perpendicular field is smaller than @xmath108 h_{\\rm k}^{\\rm eff}$ ] , the magnetization discontinuously moves from the perpendicular direction to a large cone angle by applying a current larger than the critical current .",
    "this discontinuous change of the cone angle significantly reduces the range of oscillation frequency in the self - oscillation state , as confirmed by experiment @xcite .",
    "thus , a field larger than @xmath109 should be applied to observe the oscillation in a wide range of the frequency @xcite . on the other hand , in the case of the in - plane field studied here ,",
    "the cone angle of the magnetization continuously changes with the increase of the current .",
    "therefore , a wide range of the oscillation frequency can be used .",
    "also , the self - oscillation can be excited by a small field less than @xmath110 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : critical_field ] ) , which is preferable from the view point of a low - power consumption .",
    "therefore , the use of an in - plane magnetic field will be an important technical tool for piratical application .",
    "the system studied above looks similar to an sto with the field - like torque @xcite , which was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , because both the field - like torque and the torque due to the in - plane field point to @xmath111 direction . however , there are important differences between these torques .",
    "the strength of the field - like torque depends on the electric current , and thus , the spin torque and the field - like torque can not be manipulated independently . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnitude of the in - plane field can be controlled independently from the spin torque .",
    "the sign of the field - like torque is determined by the material parameters and system size @xcite , while the direction of the in - plane field is controllable . regarding these points ,",
    "the in - plane field is more convenient than the field - like torque to control self - oscillation , although the use of the field - like torque enables to excite self - oscillation without an external field .    finally , we point out the importance of the parameter @xmath25 . the angular dependence of the spin torque , eq . ( [ eq : h_s ] ) , characterized by @xmath25 , arises from the spin - dependent transport in a ferromagnetic multilayer . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_s ] ) , the spin torque strength near the anti - parallel alignment of the magnetizations ( @xmath112 ) is larger than that near the parallel alignment ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "this is because , for example in a gmr system , the amount of the spin accumulation , which gives the spin torque on the magnetization , is large when the relative angle of the magnetizations is large .",
    "this parameter had been often neglected in previous works on , for example , an in - plane magnetized sto @xcite because this angular dependence gives small corrections on the oscillation properties such as the critical current .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath25 plays the dominant role in sto in which the constant energy curve is symmetric with respect to an axis perpendicular to the pinned layer magnetization @xcite , as in the case of the present sto with a perpendicular field @xcite .",
    "although the constant energy curve in the this paper is asymmetric due to the in - plane field , this parameter still plays a key role to excite the oscillation .",
    "this is because the field @xmath82 satisfies the following relation ; @xmath114 this indicates that the self - oscillation can not be excited by an in - plane field when @xmath115 .",
    "in other words , a finite @xmath25 , which characterizes the asymmetry of the spin torque , is necessary to excite the self - oscillation .",
    "we notice that this conclusion is consistent with the previous study on an impossibility to excite self - oscillation by spin hall effect @xcite , where the spin hall system corresponds to the limit of @xmath116 .",
    "in summary , it was shown that a stable self - oscillation can be excited in an sto with a perpendicularly magnetized free layer and an in - plane magnetized pinned layer by applying a magnetic field smaller than a critical value , eq .",
