    "the linear response to an external electromagnetic field can be described by the famous kubo formula . in the opposite case of a strong chaos one can use the approach recently developed in refs .",
    "the situation with weak chaos is quite peculiar and needs a special approach . of specific interest",

    "chaotic motion occurs only in the vicinity of separatrices of the resonances . on the other hand , inside the resonances",
    "the motion remains regular , in accordance with the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theory ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . if the number @xmath0 of degrees of freedom larger than @xmath1 , the kam surfaces do not separate the stochastic layers , therefore , they form a stochastic web that can cover whole phase space of a system . thus ,",
    "if trajectory starts _ inside _ the stochastic web , it can diffuse throughout the phase space .",
    "such a diffusion along stochastic webs was predicted by arnold in 1964  @xcite , and since that time it is known as an universal mechanism for instability and chaos in generic nonlinear hamiltonian systems with @xmath2 ( see , for example , review  @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "also , it was shown that the states corresponding to the separatrix region , have a global structure similar to the classical orbits as well .",
    "it was found that the width of such states in the unperturbed basis is much larger than of those belonging to the inside - resonance region .    in the presence of the external two - frequency time - dependent electric field",
    ", the main interest is related to the dynamics of wave packets along the narrow stochastic regions of the corresponding classical system .",
    "extensive numerical simulation demonstrate a kind of weak diffusion in the quantum model , that can be associated with the classical arnold diffusion along the coupling resonance .",
    "we have found that the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on model parameters roughly follows the classical dependence .",
    "however , the quantum diffusion is systematically slower than the classical one .",
    "this fact manifests the influence of quantum effects .",
    "it should be stressed that the quantum arnold diffusion occurs in a deep semiclassical region , specifically for the case when the number @xmath179 of chaotic eigenstates inside the classical stochastic layer is sufficiently large ( of the order of 10 or larger ) . with a decrease of the amplitude of ripple ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient strongly decreases , and for @xmath185 the diffusion disappears .",
    "therefore , one can see how quantum effects destroy the diffusive dynamics of the wave packets .",
    "another manifestation of quantum effects is the dynamical localization that persists even for large @xmath179 .",
    "specifically , we have observed that the quantum diffusion occurs only for finite times . on a larger time",
    "scale the diffusion ceases and after some characteristic time it terminates .",
    "this effect is similar to that discovered in the kicked rotor model  @xcite , and found later in other physical systems ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in our case",
    "the dynamical localization arises for a weak chaos that occurs inside the separatrix layer , in contrast to previous models with a strong ( global ) chaos in the classical description .",
    "the effects discussed in this communication can be observed experimentally , e.g. in semi - metal structures .",
    "apart from the experiments with a 2d electron gas in gaas / algaas heterojunctions  @xcite , one can consider the semi - metal rippled channel with a large number of discrete quantum levels in a deep semiclassical regime . for the observation of the dynamical localization in a response to electromagnetic radiation the channel , one can take @xmath186 m for the width , and @xmath187 m for the goffer period .",
    "then , the dimensionless value @xmath15 corresponds to the goffer amplitude of the order 3.2  nm , i.e. to few monoatomic levels .",
    "correspondingly , for the effective electron mass @xmath188 the level number @xmath189 has the energy @xmath190  ev , and the resonance frequency for the transitions between nearest states is @xmath191  ghz . in these units",
    "the period of the external field is equal to @xmath192  s , and the dimensionless value of the perturbation @xmath193 corresponds to an electric field @xmath194  v / cm .",
    "it should be noted that for above parameters the diffusion saturation time , corresponding to approximately 200 periods , is of the order of @xmath195  ns .",
    "it is clear that the electron scattering time has to be much larger .",
    "the last condition can be realized in semi - metal bi or sb structures , where the mean free path is of the order of 1  mm and the scattering time is about 10  ns for the temperature @xmath196  k.",
