    "observations of distant galaxies are an essential component in our understanding of the development of the universe .",
    "most high - redshift galaxies have been identified in the uv via the lyman break technique ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there is therefore considerable interest in constraining properties of lbgs such as the star - formation rate ( sfr ) , dust content , stellar mass and metallicity .",
    "another effective way of identifying high-@xmath8 galaxies is by observations at sub - mm wavelengths with scuba on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the relation between lbgs and scuba galaxies is still not entirely clear but studies have shown that up to 50 per cent of scuba galaxies have similar rest - frame uv colours as lbgs @xcite .",
    "lbgs and scuba galaxies may simply form a continuous distribution in sfr and dust content , with scuba galaxies occupying the upper end of the distribution @xcite . indeed",
    "a recent study of ir luminous lbgs showed that while lbgs have a diverse range of ir properties , at least some lbgs have the same ir properties as scuba galaxies and are likely to be the progenitors of today s massive giant ellipticals @xcite .",
    "the proposed starburst - agn connection that arises out of merger - driven galaxy formation scenarios ( e.g. @xcite ) , and which is a natural explanation for the observed @xmath9 relation between the mass of dormant black holes and galaxy bulges in local galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , also leads to an interest in the agn content of high-@xmath8 star forming galaxies .",
    "the incidence of agn in scuba sources has attracted considerable attention ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "most recently , @xcite have found an extremely high rate of x - ray detection of radio - identified scuba galaxies , inferring that at least 40 per cent , and perhaps as many as 75 per cent of submm - selected galaxies contain an agn .",
    "much less work has been done on the properties of agn in the lbg population .",
    "to date most work including x - ray data has focussed on sfrs and extinction corrections of lbgs without agn ( e.g. @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite analysed rest - frame uv spectra of lbgs to identify agn based on emission lines and to calculate the faint end of the agn luminosity function at high-@xmath8 .",
    "they found that 3 per cent of lbgs harbour agn , which contribute 8 per cent to the integrated 1500    uv luminosity at @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite used lbg selection in two fields ( the hdf - n and gws ) as a method of efficiently identifying the redshift of agn in x - ray surveys .",
    "the results were used to estimate the space density of moderate luminosity agn at @xmath10 , finding them to be ten times more common than high luminosity qsos .    in this paper the x - ray emission of @xmath0 lbgs in six of the survey fields presented by @xcite are analyzed .",
    "this work extends the analysis of lbgs in the 1  ms cdf - n by nandra et al .",
    "( 2002 ; hereafter n02 ) and @xcite by using more lbg fields and including x - ray spectral analysis of the lbgs . following on from the stacking analysis of lbgs by @xcite , n02 and @xcite , the x - ray emission from non - agn dominated lbgs in the two deepest fields is also analyzed .    throughout , a standard , flat @xmath11cdm cosmology with @xmath12 and h@xmath13  km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 is assumed .",
    "our sample of @xmath8@xmath143 lbgs is culled from the @xcite survey fields that have archived _ chandra _ acis imaging data .",
    "these fields are the _",
    "hubble _ deep field - north ( hdf - n ) , groth - westphal strip ( gws ) , q1422 + 2309 , ssa22 ( ssa22a and ssa22b ) , b20902 + 34 and 3c 324 .",
    "the areas of overlap between the lbg fields and the _ chandra _ data , along with the number of lbgs in the overlap areas are shown in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the lbg data for fields b20902 + 34 and 3c 324 , for which the targets of both were radio galaxies , covers a small area and therefore contain relatively few lbg candidates .",
    "q1422 + 2309 , which was centred on a @xmath15 gravitationally lensed qso , has the deepest data of all the @xcite survey fields .    in the hdf - n region ,",
    "imaging for lbg selection and spectroscopy has recently been extended by the steidel team from the original survey area to now cover the larger goods - n region .",
    "the catalogue of hdf - n lbgs used in this paper consists of all the lbgs from @xcite plus the lbgs from the extended survey area .",
    "the latest imaging and photometry is of better quality than the original data and is therefore used for any lbg candidates in the original list that are also covered by the new data",
    ".    of the lbgs considered in this work 43 per cent have confirmed spectroscopic identifications as @xmath16 galaxies . over the whole lbg survey ( containing more than 2300 objects )",
    "the redshift distribution of candidates is @xmath17 and the fraction of low - redshift interlopers is only 4 per cent . given the tightly peaked redshift distribution and the low interloper fraction we are confident that the remainder of our sample without spectroscopic confirmation are indeed high - redshift star - forming galaxies ."

    "<S> x - ray spectral analysis of the lbgs shows a mean photon index of @xmath4 , similar to local agn . </S>",
    "<S> there is evidence for absorption in at least 40 per cent of the objects . </S>",

    "<S> after correction for absorption the narrow and broad line objects show the same average luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray detected lbgs spectroscopically classified as normal galaxies , however , are less luminous in both soft and hard x - ray bands indicating that the host galaxy is outshining any optical agn signature . </S>",
    "<S> turning to the x - ray emission from lbgs without direct detections , stacking the x - ray flux in the two deepest _ chandra _ fields under consideration ( the hdf - n and gws ) produced significant detections in each , although the gws result was marginal . </S>",
    "<S> the detection in the hdf - n gives an x - ray derived sfr of @xmath5m@xmath6  yr@xmath3 per lbg and , by comparing with the uv sfr , the implied uv extinction correction is @xmath7 . </S>",
