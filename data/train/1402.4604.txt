    "reproducing formulae appear almost everywhere in the literature , from coherent states in physics to group representations , gabor analysis , wavelet analysis and its many generalizations .",
    "this theory has a wealth of applications in engineering , physics and numerical analysis ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is remarkable to observe that most existing reproducing formulae for functions @xmath10 can be formulated in one and the same general form , that is , an integral formula of the type    @xmath11    in the following sense .",
    "first of all , the domain of integration @xmath12 is a ( connected , closed , lie ) subgroup of the semidirect product @xmath0 between the heisenberg group @xmath13 and the symplectic group @xmath14 , @xmath15 is a left haar measure of @xmath12 , and @xmath16 is the extended metaplectic representation of @xmath17 , to be defined below in detail . in the current literature ,",
    "the function @xmath18 is usually referred as wavelet or admissible vector . as we shall show below , many standard reproducing formulae , such as those arising in gabor analysis and wavelet theory , are of the above type : for some groups @xmath12 , but not for all , one finds @xmath18 in such a way that the above formula holds weakly for every @xmath10 .",
    "thus , some groups @xmath12 give rise to interesting analysis and some do not , like , for example , the full factors themselves , i.e. @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "the question whether a given subgroup @xmath21 leads to a reproducing formula or not is both relevant and difficult , and is the main theme of our recent investigations @xcite , together with the explicit description of the admissible vectors . the ongoing formulation of things may be simplified a bit because the reproducing formula   is equivalent to @xmath22 which is manifestly insensitive to phase multiplicative factors , that is , invariant under transformations of the type @xmath23 .",
    "this allows a technical reduction , that is , one can factor out the center of the heisenberg group , whose action through @xmath16 is through phase factors , and one may safely pass from the whole group @xmath17 to the somewhat simpler group @xmath24 .",
    "we formalize this discussion in the following :    [ rs ] a connected lie subgroup @xmath12 of @xmath24 is a _ reproducing group _ for @xmath16 if there exists a function @xmath18 such that the identity holds weakly for all @xmath10 . any such @xmath18 is called a reproducing function .",
    "notice that we do require formula   to hold for all functions in @xmath25 for the same window @xmath26 , but we do not require the restriction of @xmath16 to @xmath12 to be irreducible .",
    "in this paper we consider a class of triangular subgroups of the symplectic group , that we collectively denote as the class @xmath27 . from the structural point of view ,",
    "a group @xmath28 is a semidirect product of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a @xmath29-dimensional subspace of @xmath3 symmetric matrices and @xmath4 is a closed subgroup of @xmath5 acting on @xmath2 ; hence @xmath2 is abelian and normal in @xmath12 .",
    "evidently , when seen within @xmath30 , each of these groups is contained in the symplectic factor .",
    "we shall show that many examples used in the applications fall in this class .",
    "this motivates our study of the class @xmath27 .",
    "our main result is provided by theorem [ repthm ] below , which contains necessary and sufficient conditions for a wavelet @xmath31 to be reproducing on a group @xmath12 in @xmath27 .",
    "this result is a far - reaching extension of the reproducing conditions for the special cases treated in @xcite .",
    "we underline that this result is based on a deep study of the properties of a quadratic mapping @xmath32 on @xmath33 , developed in section [ 42 ] below .",
    "finally , we shall provide new examples of reproducing groups in the class @xmath27 in dimension @xmath9 .",
    "the paper also contains some additional remarks concerning an alternative formulation of the concept of _ admissible group _ , a formally stronger notion than the notion given in definition [ rs ] .",
    "we also clarify in what sense our setup includes gabor and wavelet analyses .",
    "the symplectic group is defined by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the standard symplectic form @xmath36    the metaplectic representation @xmath37 of ( the two - sheeted cover of ) the symplectic group arises as intertwining operator between the standard schrdinger representation @xmath38 of the heisenberg group @xmath13 and the representation that is obtained from it by composing @xmath38 with the action of @xmath39 by automorphisms on @xmath13 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we briefly review its construction .",
    "the heisenberg group @xmath13 is the group obtained by defining on @xmath40 the product@xmath41 where @xmath42 stands for the standard symplectic form in @xmath43 given in .",
    "we denote the translation and modulation operators on @xmath25 by @xmath44 the schrdinger representation of the group @xmath13 on @xmath25 is then defined by @xmath45 where we write @xmath46 when we separate space components ( that is @xmath47 ) from frequency components ( that is @xmath48 ) in a point @xmath49 in phase space @xmath43 .",
    "the symplectic group acts on @xmath13 via automorphisms that leave the center @xmath50 of @xmath13 pointwise fixed : @xmath51 therefore , for any fixed @xmath52 there is a representation @xmath53 whose restriction to the center is a multiple of the identity . by the stone - von neumann theorem , @xmath54 is equivalent to @xmath38 .",
    "that is , there exists an intertwining unitary operator @xmath55 such that @xmath56 , for all @xmath57 . by schur",
    "s lemma , @xmath37 is determined up to a phase factor @xmath58 .",
    "it turns out that the phase ambiguity is really a sign , so that @xmath37 lifts to a representation of the ( double cover of the ) symplectic group .",
    "it is the famous metaplectic or shale - weil representation .",
    "the representations @xmath38 and @xmath37 can be combined and give rise to the extended metaplectic representation of the group @xmath59 , the semidirect product of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the group law on @xmath30 is @xmath60 and the extended metaplectic representation @xmath16 of @xmath30 is @xmath61    observe that the reproducing formula   is insensitive to phase factors : if we replace @xmath62 with @xmath63 the formula is unchanged , for any @xmath64 .",
    "the role of the center of the heisenberg group is thus irrelevant , so that the `` true '' group under consideration is @xmath65 , which we denote again by @xmath30 .",
    "thus @xmath30 acts naturally by affine transformations on phase space , namely @xmath66    for elements @xmath39 in special form , the metaplectic representation can be computed explicitly in a simple way . for @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the fourier transform @xmath70 in the above formula and elsewhere , @xmath71 denotes the inner product of @xmath72 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath73 , @xmath74 will denote their inner product in @xmath75 .",
    "other notation is as follows .",
    "we put @xmath76 , @xmath77 . for @xmath78",
    ", @xmath79 stands for the @xmath80-norm of measurable functions on @xmath33 with respect to lebesgue measure .",
    "the left haar measure of a group @xmath12 will be written @xmath15 and we always assume that the haar measure of a compact group is normalized so that the total mass is one . let @xmath81 be an open set of @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath82 is the space of smooth functions with compact support contained in @xmath81 .",
    "we show below that both gabor and wavelet analyses can be viewed as particular cases of the general setup that we are considering . this fact is somehow known and is perhaps part of common knowledge , but on the one hand we could not locate it in the literature in a precise fashion and , on the other hand , we want to present some additional remarks that are of some independent interest .",
    "we thus start with a side observation .",
    "the notion of reproducing group admits an equivalent version that is obtained by weakening a property that has been investigated in @xcite and that is formulated by means of the wigner distribution .",
    "the cross - wigner distribution @xmath83 of @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 the quadratic expression @xmath86 is called the _ wigner distribution _ of @xmath87 .",
    "we collect below some of its well - known properties ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
