    "one of the most fundamental problems in theoretical physics in the 21st century is to construct a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "general relativity and quantum mechanics , which are the cornerstones of the 20th century physics , are mutually inconsistent .",
    "for example , general relativity is not renormalizable , and conventional perturbative techniques in quantum field theory does not apply .",
    "not only are these two theories inconsistent , but there are indications that theoretical consistency requires unification of these two theories . in general relativity , there is a celebrated singularity theorem @xcite , which predicts the existence of singularities where general relativity breaks down . in this sense general relativity is not a consistent theory in itself , and singularity occurs precisely when quantum effects are expected to play crucial roles .",
    "the existence of singularities is classically not a problem if cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite holds and singularity is surrounded by the horizon . however , quantum mechanically black holes emit particles @xcite .",
    "this then leads us to the paradox of information loss @xcite ( see refs .   for review ) , since we only have a thermal radiation coming out of the event horizon regardless of what goes inside the horizon .",
    "one should always keep in mind , however , that these arguments are based on semiclassical quantization of general relativity , and proper treatment of these problems require a theory of quantum gravity which unifies the general relativity and quantum mechanics in a consistent framework .    over decades",
    "string theory has been the most promising candidate for quantum gravity . just as in general relativity , string theory is severely constrained by various consistency conditions , and it is often impossible to tune the parameters by hand .",
    "this means that if we can extract quantitative predictions from string theory , we can perform pass / fail test of string theory as a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "computation of black hole entropy is an excellent example for such a stringent test .",
    "one of the most successful predictions of string theory , as shown by strominger and vafa in 1996 @xcite , is that string theory correctly reproduces the semiclassical bekenstein - hawking entropy @xcite of a class of supersymmetric extremal black holes ( see e.g. refs .   for review ) . in statistical mechanics ,",
    "entropy is given by the logarithm of total degeneracy of states , and strominger and vafa showed that string theory reproduces the correct number of states in the limit of large charges .",
    "their analysis has subsequently been generalized to many other black holes , including four - dimensional black holes and non - extremal black holes .",
    "most remarkably , string theory now reproduces not only the semi - classical bekenstein - hawking entropy of general relativity , but also the subleading entropy contributions from the higher curvature corrections to the einstein - hilbert action @xcite ( see ref .   for review ) , as dictated by the wald s formula @xcite .",
    "this gives a rather remarkable quantitative check of string theory as a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "however , there are many issues that remain to be solved . for example , the entropy is typically determined only by the asymptotic growth of the microstate degeneracies ( given by the cardy formula @xcite ) , in the limit of large charges . however , we hope that string theory gives a more complete and detailed theory of the microstates , not just the asymptotic growth of their numbers",
    ". this will hopefully lead to rich and yet unknown aspects of quantum gravity .",
    "this is closely related to the question : what is the geometry at the planck scale ?",
    "one of the key ideas in general relativity is the `` geometrization of physics '' , where the physics notion ( e.g. mass ) are translated and reformulated in terms of geometry ( e.g. curvature ) .",
    "if we follow a similar path , the central question in quantum gravity should be to identify the `` quantum geometry '' , geometry at the planck scale where spacetime itself fluctuates quantum mechanically .    in this paper",
    ", we will make small steps towards these ambitious goals .",
    "unfortunately , solving string theory in gravity backgrounds is a notoriously difficult problem .",
    "the strategy we take is to simplify the problem  to replace the problem of gravity with a problem of gauge theory . in string theory compactifications",
    ", this corresponds to taking the calabi - yau manifold to be non - compact .",
    "of course , the notion of a black hole is subtle in this limit since the gravity decouples and the newton constant becomes zero .",
    "however , part of the important data in gravity theory still remain .",
    "for example , we can still discuss entropy of black holes since we can take a scaling limit where the mass of the black hole goes to infinity , while the entropy is kept finite .",
    "moreover , it is generally believed that microstate degeneracies of black holes are captured by the bps index , which is deformation invariant and stays constant in the decoupling process .",
    "the counting of black hole microstates is now turned into a counting problem of bps states in supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "the counting problem of bps states in string theories and in supersymmetric gauge theories is an important problem in itself , even if we forget about the motivation from black hole physics .",
    "for example , they provide primary tools to test various dualities in supersymmetric gauge theories and in string theory ( e.g. non - perturbative checks @xcite of montonen - olive duality @xcite for @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory ) .",
    "bps solitons in supersymmetric gauge theories have a rich structure , and provides a classic example of fruitful collaboration between physics and mathematics , as exemplified in the adhm @xcite and nahm @xcite construction .",
    "furthermore , as we will see in later sections bps state counting has an intimate connection with another counting problem in string theory , the topological string theory ( mathematically gromov - witten theory ) .",
    "in the first part of this paper , we show that when @xmath1 is a toric calabi - yau manifold ( this roughly means that @xmath1 has an action of the three - dimensional complex torus ; see refs .   for review )",
    ", we can give explicit answers to the bps counting problem .",
    "more precisely , each of the bps states contributing to the bps index ( defined in section[sec.index ] ) is in one - to - one correspondence with a configuration of a molten crystal , and the bps partition function @xmath2 ( defined in section[sec.index ] ) is the same as the statistical partition function of a crystal melting model @xcite : z_bps = z_crystal .",
    "section[chap.crystal ] is devoted to the explanation of this result .",
    "remarkably , the derivation of the formula above depends on the newly developed mathematical theory , the non - commutative donaldson - thomas theory @xcite .",
    "this theory gives a new invariant for calabi - yau manifolds , which exactly coincides with the bps index we are interested in .",
    "this means that bps counting problem is important not only to physicists but also to the mathematicians alike .    in the next section ( section[chap.thermodynamic ] )",
    ", we discuss the implication of these results to quantum gravity .",
    "we show that the thermodynamic limit of the crystal gives a projection of the shape of the mirror calabi - yau manifold @xcite .",
    "this in particular suggests that if we start from a classical smooth geometry and goes to smaller and smaller scales , the geometry gets discretized into a set of atoms when we finally arrive at the planck scale . in this sense",
    "an atom in the crystal melting model is `` an atom / quark of internal geometry '' , a discretized version of the geometry at the planck scale .",
    "we therefore see that the two problems posed earlier are now related .",
    "each of the microstate , which is an atom of the crystal , is the discretized version of the geometry ; thus the problem of identifying black hole microstates is solved by the quantum structure of geometry !    in the second half of the paper , we move on to the discussion of the wall crossing phenomena ( see section[sec.wc ] for an introduction ) .",
    "wall crossing phenomena states that the bps degeneracy jumps as we change the value of the moduli of the calabi - yau manifold .",
    "wall crossing phenomena , first discussed in ref .   in the context of supersymmetric @xmath3 theories in two dimensions ,",
    "have a long history of nearly two decades .",
    "they also play important roles in the seiberg - witten theory @xcite and its stringy realization @xcite ( see also refs .   as well as ref .",
    ") . in these old days , it was possible to derive the jump of bps states in simple cases , but generalization seemed to be difficult .",
    "the recent breakthrough was partly triggered by the paper of kontsevich and soibelman @xcite , who proposed a rather general formula for the jumps of bps degeneracies ( or mathematically `` generalized donaldson - thomas invariants '' ) , generalizing the `` semi - primitive '' wall crossing formula previously proposed by denef and moore @xcite .",
    "physical interpretations of the formulas were subsequently given in refs .  .",
    "we discuss these formulas in section[chap.wcf ] and in [ app.ks ] .",
    "the wall crossing formulas are rather general , and can be applied to our setup , namely compactification on the toric calabi - yau manifold . in particular ,",
    "the example of the resolved conifold is analyzed in ref .   and independently in ref .  .",
    "there it was shown that the non - commutative donaldson - thomas invariants ( which are just generalized donaldson - thomas invariants in a certain chamber ) discussed in section[chap.crystal ] is related by wall crossing to the commutative ( i.e. ordinary ) donaldson - thomas invariants . in physics language",
    ", this means that the crystal melting partition function is related by wall crossings to the topological string partition function .",
    "this clarifies the connection of our crystal melting model and another crystal melting model proposed in ref .  , which describes the topological vertex @xcite .",
    "this is not the end of the story , however .",
    "first , it was observed in the literature that the bps partition function computed by the non - commutative donaldson - thomas theory takes a beautiful infinite product form , and there should be an intuitive explanation of this result . from the viewpoint of non - commutative donaldson - thomas theory , this seems miraculous : we first compute the bps indices separately by intricate mathematics , and only after summing up all of them and going through combinatorics can we see that the partition function takes such a simple form .",
    "second , the partition function obtained in section[chap.crystal ] is very similar to the topological string partition function , and it is necessary to understand the precise relation and to explain why the topological string partition function enters into the story . in section[chap.m - theory ] we give a simple , yet another derivation of the wall crossing phenomena from the viewpoint of m - theory @xcite .",
    "this answers the questions raised in the previous paragraph . by lifting type iia brane configurations to m - theory and by using the 4d/5d correspondence @xcite ,",
    "the problem of counting bps states is mapped ( under certain conditions explained in section[chap.m - theory ] ) to a counting problem of free m2-brane particles in five dimensions , which span the free particle fock space .",
    "this naturally explains the infinite product form of the bps partition function . also , the counting problem of m2-brane particles is a generalization of the gopakumar - vafa ( gv ) argument @xcite , which explains the appearance of the topological string partition function .",
    "more precisely , we prove a formula which schematically takes a form z_bps = z_top^2 | _ chamber . [ z = z2 ] this derivation is consistent with another derivation from the wall crossing formula . as a bonus",
    ", we have new mathematical predictions for non - toric examples , which can be tested by future mathematical developments .",
    "there is a generalization of the above - mentioned story to the case of open bps invariants .",
    "closed bps invariants discussed up to this point are defined by counting d2-branes wrapping 2-cycles of the calabi - yau manifold .",
    "open bps invariants are defined by counting d2-branes wrapping on disks ending on another d - branes ( d4-branes ) .",
    "open bps invariants are natural generalizations of closed invariants .",
    "moreover , they give a useful computational tool to study closed invariants for complicated geometries , as shown in the topological vertex formalism @xcite .    in section[chap.open",
    "] we first give a definition of the `` non - commutative topological vertex '' , which gives a basic building block for computing open bps invariants .",
    "the definition uses the crystal melting model , and we perform several consistency checks of the proposal .",
    "we also discuss the wall crossing phenomena for the open bps invariants both with respect to the open and closed string moduli , by again using the viewpoint of m - theory .    in the final section ( section[chap.discussion ] ) ,",
    "we close this paper by pointing out several interesting problems which suggest directions for future research .",
    "we also collect slightly technical results in the appendices .",
    "this paper is essentially the author s ph.d thesis ( submitted to university of tokyo on november 2009 ) , which in turn is mostly based on his papers refs .  .",
    "we tried our best to make the presentation consistent and to present a unified perspective on the problem .",
    "however , bps state counting and wall crossing phenomena are very active areas of research with long history , and is still growing very rapidly as of this writing .",
    "this inevitably means that there are many important omissions .",
    "for example , in this review there is almost no discussion of the wall crossing phenomena from 4d @xmath4 gauge theory viewpoint ( see e.g. refs   in this direction ) .",
    "and our discussion is mostly on the 6d calabi - yau side .",
    "moreover , in order to keep this paper to a reasonable length we could not include enough introductory material in this review .",
    "the complete introduction will require another review , but the good starting point is the lecture note ref .  .",
    "the interdependence of the sections are shown in fig.[fig.dependence ] .",
    "for the convenience of the reader , each section begins with a short summary of the section .",
    "the connections between different sections are emphasized throughout this review in order to organize the whole material into a unified framework .",
    "however , some sections are mostly independent , and do not require prior reading of earlier sections . for examples , most of section 5 does not require the prior reading of part i.",
    "before venturing into the study of crystal melting and wall crossing phenomena beginning section[chap.crystal ] , we here give a brief summary of the bps states , bps indices and their wall crossing phenomena .",
    "the material in this section is standard , and can safely be skipped by readers familiar with these topics .      in theories with extended ( @xmath5 ) supersymmetry in four dimensions ,",
    "the supersymmetry algebra has a central extension @xmath6 , which appears in the commutation relation of two supercharges @xmath7 ( in the two - component notation ) : \\{q_^m , q_^n } = _ z_mn . from the above equation it follows that @xmath8 is an antisymmetric matrix . in the case of @xmath4 supersymmetry treated in this paper , @xmath8 has just one component ( a complex number ) @xmath9 .",
    "we can then show , purely from symmetry arguments , that the mass @xmath10 of a particle always satisfies the bps inequality m| z | .",
    "[ eq.bps ] states which saturates this inequality are called bps states .",
    "bps states have played special roles in the study of supersymmetric gauge theories and string theories .",
    "this is because bps states are protected from quantum corrections . in other words",
    ", quantum corrections may renormalize the value of @xmath11 , but the bps inequality holds for all values of the coupling constant .",
    "this is basically due to the fact that bps states are annihilated by certain combination of supercharges and thus their representation have smaller dimensions ( i.e. they belong to short representations ) as compared with non - bps states ( which belong to long representations ) .",
    "therefore bps states provide an indispensable tool to study the strong coupling behavior of supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "they are also important for understanding black hole microstates , and also are related to mathematical invariants , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "let us try to be more specific . in this paper",
    ", we are going to study the counting problem of bps states arising from type iia string theory compactified on a calabi - yau manifold @xmath1 . depending on whether @xmath1 is compact or non - compact",
    ", we have a 4d @xmath12 supergravity or 4d @xmath12 supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "we want to study bps states which preserve half of the @xmath4 supersymmetry in the theory .",
    "these states span the bps hilbert space @xmath13 and we want to study the structure of this hilbert space .",
    "the bps states have charges @xmath14 , which takes value in the ( @xmath15-valued ) cohomology of @xmath1=h^6(x;@xmath16)h^4(x;@xmath16)h^2(x;@xmath16 ) h^0(x;@xmath16 ) , and this means that the bps hilbert states can be decomposed into sectors with specific charge @xmath14 : @xmath17_bps= _ @xmath17 _ , .",
    "we define the bps index @xmath18 as an important quantity to understand the structure of @xmath19 .",
    "this index is defined in such a way that the index does not jump when two short multiplets combine into a long multiplet . in four - dimensional @xmath4 supersymmetry",
    "the answer is unique , and is given by - th helicity supertrace defined by _ n()=(-1)^n/2",
    "_ @xmath17 _ ( -1)^2j_3 ( 2j_3)^n",
    ". however , there are several restrictions one has to worry about .",
    "first , @xmath20 should be an even integer because we have cpt invariance and cpt send @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "second , for @xmath23 the helicity supertrace vanishes , and if @xmath20 is large then not only the short multiplets , but also the long multiplets , begin to contribute . in general ,",
    "if we have four - dimensional @xmath24 supersymmetry , the only possibility is an even integer @xmath20 satisfying @xmath25 , and for @xmath4 , @xmath26 is the only possible option",
    ". the quantity @xmath18 in the main text is @xmath27 in this notation .",
    "the situation is different , for example , for @xmath0 . in this case ,",
    "index is not unique and is given either by @xmath28 or @xmath29 , or their linear combination .",
    "see appendix e of ref .   for a nice summary .",
    "] ( ) = -_@xmath17 _ , ( -1)^2 j_3 ( 2j_3)^2 , [ indexdef ] where @xmath21 is the 3rd component of the @xmath30 spatial rotation symmetry . also , the factor @xmath31 is just a convention , which will turn out to be useful later .",
    "we can calculate the index explicitly for an @xmath4 susy multiplet . for our purposes",
    "we only need a massive multiplet , and a massive multiplet of @xmath4 theory is either + ( 1 ) a massive long representation , l_j : [ j]([1 ] 4[1/2]5[0]),[l_j ] or ( 2 ) a short bps massive multiplet s_j : [ j]([1/2]2[0 ] ) , [ sj ] where @xmath32 is a hypermultiplet and @xmath33 is a vectormultiplet .",
    "their contributions to the bps index are ( s_j)=(-1)^2j ( 2j+1),(l_j)=0 . this explicitly verifies that the long multiplets do not contribute , and that hypermultiplets and vectormultiplets contribute @xmath34 and @xmath35 to the index .",
    "every bps particle in an @xmath4 theory has a universal half - hypermultiplet obtained from quantizing the fermionic degrees of freedom associated to its center of mass ( see ) .",
    "we can therefore write @xmath36\\oplus 2[0])\\otimes { \\ensuremath{\\mathcal{h}}}^{'}_{\\textrm{bps},\\gamma}$ ] .",
    "writing @xmath37 for @xmath38 we have ( ) & = -2  _ @xmath17^ _ , ( -1)^2j_3 ( 2(j_3)^2-(j_3-)^2-(j_3+)^2 ) + & =  _ @xmath17^ _ , ( -1)^2j_3 .",
    "the final result is simply that we have the witten index @xmath39 , the number of boson minus the number of fermions , where bosons / fermions refer to the spin @xmath40 in .",
    "this quantity is important since in many examples it is this index which gives the correct microstate degeneracies of black holes .",
    "let us define the generating function of the bps index .",
    "as we will see later in examples , it is often more useful to study the generating function rather than to study each of the bps index separately .",
    "decompose the charge lattice @xmath41 into electric and magnetic charges lattices : @xmath42 in type iia compactification of a calabi - yau manifold , we have ^e= h^6(x;@xmath16)h^4(x;@xmath16 ) , ^m = h^2(x;@xmath16)h^0(x;@xmath16 ) , and when we write = ( q_0,q_i , p^i , p^0)h^6(x;@xmath16)h^4(x;@xmath16)h^2(x;@xmath16)h^0(x;@xmath16 ) , the electric charges are @xmath43 and the magnetic ones @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 run over @xmath47 because of poincar@xmath48 duality .",
    "these can be different in non - compact examples we discuss later .",
    "] and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "we define the generating function @xmath2 by a z_bps(^,p^)=_q _ ( = ( q_,p^ ) )  e^-^ q_. this means that we are considering microcanonical ensemble of magnetic charges @xmath50 and a canonical ensemble for electric charges @xmath51 with chemical potentials @xmath52 .",
    "such a mixed microcanonical / canonical ensemble appears in the ooguri - strominger - vafa conjecture @xcite . in particular , it was shown there that @xmath53(^,p^):=(z_bps(^,p^ ) ) is the legendre transform of the entropy @xmath54 of the black hole s_bh(q_,p^)=@xmath53(^,p^)-^ @xmath53(^,p^ ) . for this reason , @xmath2",
    "is sometimes denoted @xmath55 in the literature .      in the previous section we defined the bps index @xmath18 and its generating function @xmath56 . from the viewpoint of",
    "counting bps states all we need to do is to determine these numbers .",
    "however , there is an interesting twist , the wall crossing phenomena .",
    "the wall crossing phenomena states that the bps index @xmath18 depends on the value of moduli of the calabi - yau manifold at infinity .",
    "more concretely , consider the khler moduli of the calabi - yau manifold",
    ". then wall crossing phenomena states that the bps index jumps along the real codimension 1 subspace of the khler moduli space .",
    "the codimension 1 subspace is often called the walls of marginal stability ( or sometimes simply walls ) , and the walls of marginal stability divides the khler moduli space into several regions , called chambers .",
    "the bps index is piecewise constant inside each of the chambers , but jumps as we cross the walls of marginal stability .",
    "we sometimes use the notation @xmath57 to explicitly show the dependence on khler moduli .",
    "what is the physics behind such a jump ? naively , the jump seems to be inconsistent with the common wisdom that index stays invariant under continuous deformations . the resolution to this puzzle",
    "is given by the fact that @xmath58 used in the definition of the bps index is in fact a _",
    "one - particle _ hilbert space .",
    "consider the following situation : there is a stable particle with charge @xmath14 when the khler moduli is @xmath59 .",
    "when we change the khler moduli to @xmath60 , the particle becomes unstable and decays into two particles with charges @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( see fig.[fig.decay ] .",
    "of course , the charge conservation dictates that @xmath63 . ) .",
    "this means that the one - particle hilbert space at @xmath59 is larger than that at @xmath60 .",
    "this explains the jump of the bps index : although the index is deformation invariant , the hilbert space over which we are taking the trace jumps as we move around the khler moduli space .. ] of course , the reverse process is also possible : the stable particles can combine to make a new bound state .",
    "now the next question is how to determine the positions of walls of marginal stability .",
    "in fact , this is easy .",
    "consider the decay @xmath64 .",
    "then the particle with charge @xmath14 is stable ( unstable ) if its mass @xmath65 is larger ( smaller ) than the mass or particles @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in other words , on the walls of marginal stability we have @xmath66 at the same time , since the particles are bps the mass is given by the central charge @xmath67 since the central charge is a linear function with respect to charges , we have @xmath68 the only way to make the above three equations consistent is to have ( z(_1))=(z(_2 ) ) .",
    "[ wallposition ] this is the equation determining the position of walls of marginal stability . from",
    "it follows that the position of walls of marginal stability for the decay process @xmath64 is the same as that for the process @xmath69 .",
    "we can also consider more complicated decay patterns , for example @xmath70 .",
    "however , such a decay occurs in a higher codimension subspace of the khler moduli , which in this case is determined by @xmath71 since these decay patterns are non - generic , we are not going to consider these complicated decay patterns in the rest of this paper .    in this section",
    "we have formulated the problem : to determine the bps index or its generating function in each chamber of the moduli space . in the following sections we will see that this problem is beautifully solved using the crystal melting model .",
    "in this section we discuss the crystal melting model proposed in ref .  . the work @xcite is motivated by and is based on earlier results in mathematics @xcite .",
    "we already discussed bps state counting in section[sec.index ] , but here we would like to be more specific and would like to prepare some notations used throughout the rest of this paper .",
    "there are different versions of bps counting problems depending on which string theory and what kind of branes we consider . as in the previous section , in this paper we concentrate on the bps counting problem of type iia string theory compactified on a calabi - yau manifold @xmath1 .",
    "is dual to heterotic string theory on @xmath72 . ]",
    "we emphasize here that the problem in this paper is the counting in the _ physical _ string theory , not in the topological string theory .",
    "topological string theory comes later into the story , somewhat surprisingly ( see section[chap.m - theory ] for clarification on this point ) .    in this section and the following ,",
    "we assume in addition that @xmath1 is a toric calabi - yau manifold .",
    "the advantage of this choice is that thanks to the torus action on @xmath1 we can often perform explicit computations , therefore making quantitative statements possible .",
    "since @xmath1 is non - compact , the four - dimensional theory is an @xmath12 supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "we consider 1/2 bps states of this @xmath12 theory .",
    "in string theory , bps states are realized as supersymmetric bps bound states of d - branes wrapping holomorphic cycles .",
    "we concentrate on the configuration of d - branes which are particles in 4d : in other words , we consider dp - branes wrapping p - cycles .",
    "d - branes which are vortex strings and domain walls in 4d are also of potential interest , and we will see such examples in the discussion of open bps invariants in section[chap.open ] .    in type iia string theory , we have dp - branes with @xmath73 even . we therefore consider d0/d2-branes wrapping holomorphic compact 0/2-cycles of the calabi - yau manifold . due to",
    "the slightly technical reasons explained later , we do not include d4-branes wrapping 4-cycles .",
    "we also consider a single d6-brane filling the entire calabi - yau manifold .",
    "the d6-brane is different from other d - branes in that it wraps the whole @xmath1 , which is non - compact ( recall toric calabi - yau manifold is non - compact ) .",
    "we will see later that the d6-brane plays crucial roles in the discussion of the wall crossing phenomena .",
    "let us denote the d - brane charges of the particles by = ( n,,0,1 ) h^6(x;@xmath16)h^4(x;@xmath16)h^2(x;@xmath16)h^0(x;@xmath16 ) , where @xmath74 collectively denotes an element of @xmath75 .",
    "as in the introduction , the question is how to compute the bps index @xmath76 or its generating function z_bps(q , q)=_n , ( = ( n,,0,1))q^n q^ , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 .      before discussing the crystal melting model , let us summarize the known connection between the bps partition function and the topological string theory . in the literature ,",
    "the partition function @xmath2 we define here is related to topological string theory partition function @xmath79 in two different contexts .",
    "first , as explained in section[sec.index ] the quantity @xmath2 is the same the black hole partition function @xmath55 which appears in the context of ooguri - strominger - vafa conjecture @xcite .",
    "the conjecture states that when the d - brane charges are chosen such that bound states become large black holes with smooth event horizons , the generating function @xmath80 of a suitable index for black hole microstates is equal to the absolute value squared of the topological string partition function @xmath81 , z_bh=| z_top|^2 , to all orders in the string coupling expansion .",
    "second , when there is a single d6 brane with d0 and d2 branes bound on it , it has been proposed @xcite that the bound states are counted by the donaldson - thomas invariants @xcite of the moduli space of ideal sheaves is mathematically defined to be a torsion - free sheaf of rank 1 with trivial determinant .",
    "given such an @xmath82 , we can determine the subscheme @xmath83 ( roughly speaking , the subspace spanned by the d - brane ) by @xmath84 donaldson - thomas invariants @xmath85 counts the `` number '' of such ideal sheaves with @xmath86=\\beta\\in h_2(x,{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{z}}}),\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath87 are d0 and d2-brane charges as defined previously .",

    "let us recall that , in section[sec.quiver ] , we started with a configuration of d0 and d2 branes on the toric calabi - yau manifold and took a t - duality along the fiber to arrive at the brane configuration .",

    "[ backtomodule ] in particular , the formula means that the rank of the gauge group @xmath249 at the node @xmath40 is equal to the number of atoms with the color corresponding to the node @xmath40 that have been removed from the crystal .",

    "when @xmath274 is large , however , @xmath281 is smaller than the planck scale @xmath282 kicks in first .",
    "this means that we can explore the ` quantum ' aspects of geometry .",
    "the natural question is to understand the relation between the two descriptions . in this section ,",
    "following the result of ref .",
    "we will show how the smooth calabi - yau geometry emerges from the discrete structure of the crystal melting model in the limit @xmath283 .",
    "since @xmath274 is the chemical potential for the total number of atoms removed , @xmath284 means that we are in the thermodynamic limit ( high temperature limit ) , where an infinite number of atoms are removed .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that a classical geometric picture emerges in the limit of large d0 and d2 charges since it can represent a large black hole in the superstring theory .",
    "the corresponding thermodynamic limit in the dimer model was studied in ref .  .",
    "there are two main results proved in this section .",
    "first , the limit shape ( see fig.[fig.limitshape ] ) of the crystal in the thermodynamic limit coincides with a projection ( amoeba ) of the mirror calabi - yau manifold .",

    "despite the non - trivial wall crossing factors between the two theories discussed in section[sec.crystalsummary ] , the thermodynamic limit of the crystal partition function gives the topological string partition function .",

    "we can assume that @xmath61 contains a d6-brane , while @xmath62 contains none .",

    ", we are in the opposite regime , of a large number of collinear vacua . in this regime ,",
    "a very naive application of overcounts the change in the soliton number .",

    "the order of in which we string the @xmath62-solitons in a chain would matter .",

    "the dimension of the corresponding @xmath20-particle hilbert space is not @xmath694 , as the naive application of ref",

    "as we have seen , it seems to be rather non - trivial to extend the arguments in section[chap.m - theory ] and section[chap.wcf ] to these situations .",
    "this is an important problem since calabi - yau geometry with compact 4-cycles frequently appears in geometric engineering and in black hole physics , and comparison with semiclassical entropy formula of black holes ( e.g. bmpv black hole @xcite ) often requires large d6-brane charges .",

    "@xcite for recent discussion of multiple d6-brane charges",
    ".    one should remember that in simple examples , the answer is given by using the non - commutative topological vertex in section[sec.def ] .",

    "what we are going to do is to give an explicit correspondence between a perfect matching of the bipartite graph @xmath712 and a configuration of molten crystal .",
    "we first construct a perfect matching from a molten crystal . given a molten crystal as shown in fig.[fig.sppmodule ] ,",

    "it is proven by ref .   that such a subset of edges of @xmath712 is a perfect matching .",
    "this is the perfect matching we wanted to construct .        in the case",
    "when no atoms are removed from the crystal , the perfect matching obtained by this method is called the canonical perfect matching , which we denote by @xmath302 . since",
    "only a finite number of atoms are removed from the crystal , the perfect matching obtained from a molten crystal by the above method coincides with @xmath302 when sufficiently away from the reference point @xmath184 .",
    "conversely , given a perfect matching @xmath303 which coincides with @xmath302 when sufficiently away from the reference point @xmath184 , we can reproduce a molten crystal .",
    "let us superimpose @xmath303 with @xmath302 , and we have a finite number of loops , as shown in fig.[fig.sppheight ] in the case of suspended pinched point .",
    "define a height function @xmath713 such that          by removing @xmath715 atoms from each @xmath220 , we can construct a molten crystal .",
    "it was proven in ref .   that the set of atoms removed from the crystal so defined satisfies the melting rule of section[molten.subsec ] .",
    "this establishes the one - to - one correspondence between a molten crystal and a perfect matching of the bipartite graph , meaning that bps states can also be counted by perfect matchings of the bipartite graph @xmath712 .",
    "finally , let us finish this appendix by pointing out an interesting connection of the canonical perfect matching @xmath302 with toric geometry .",
    "the example of canonical perfect matching @xmath302 for the suspended pinched point is shown in fig.[fig.sppempty ] . in this example , the asymptotic form of the bipartite graph has four different patterns .",
    "each of four patterns is periodic and therefore an be thought of as a perfect matching of the bipartite graph on @xmath108 . in the brane tiling literature , a perfect",
    "matching on the bipartite graph on @xmath108 is known to correspond to one of the lattice points of the toric diagram @xcite .- valued height function , which is similar to the height function @xmath713 defined previously . ]",
    "we recognize that the four perfect matchings are identified with the four corners of the toric diagram in fig.[fig.spptiling]-(a ) and that the borders between different patterns are identified with the blue lines in fig.[fig.spptiling]-(b ) , which makes the @xmath224-web of the diagram .      in general , for an arbitrary toric calabi - yau manifold",
    ", we can use the same pattern to construct a perfect matching . divide the universal covering of the bipartite graph into segments separated by the @xmath224-web of the toric diagram .",
    "the perfect matching in each segment is periodic and is identified with one of the perfect matchings of bipartite graphs on @xmath108 , which corresponds to one of the lattice points of the toric diagram and the lattice point in question is precisely the vertex surrounded by the two @xmath224-webs on @xmath108 .",
    "this determines a perfect matching .",
    "in particular , this means that the ridges of the crystal line up with the @xmath224-web of the toric diagram .",
    "this pattern holds for all toric calabi - yau manifolds without compact 4-cycles , and we conjecture that the perfect matching constructed in this way is canonical .",
    "we would like to stress again that this conjecture is not needed to construct the crystal melting model .",
    "here we are simply pointing out that , in the examples we have studied , the crystalline structures fit beautifully with the corresponding toric geometries .        why do we need to bother about these black holes ?",
    "in many examples in the literature , including the strominger - vafa paper @xcite , the d - brane configurations correspond to single centered black holes .",
    "this is not always the case @xcite , however , and the bps index for the d - branes contain contribution from multi - centered black holes in general @xcite .",
    "in these cases , we need to discuss multi - centered black holes in order to correctly account for the bps index of the d - branes .",
    "indeed , most of the bps states discussed in this paper correspond to multi - centered black holes .",
    "moreover , the supergravity viewpoint provides an intuitive description of bps bound states and their wall crossing phenomena , and even yields the ( semi-)primitive wall crossing formula as discussed in section[sec.wcfderivation ] .",
    "we should also keep in mind , however , that there is a limitation to the supergravity approach , since some of the d - brane configuration discussed in this paper does not have large black holes and therefore validity of supergravity approximation is not guaranteed .",
    "multi - centered black holes are specified by a set of charges @xmath716 at the `` centers '' @xmath717 of the black hole .",
    "the ansatz for the metric is of the form ds^2=-e^2 u ( dt+)^2+e^-2u d^2 , where the function @xmath718 is a warp factor and @xmath157 is a one - form .",
    "they are determined by bps equations of motion . in this appendix",
    "we neglect higher derivative corrections to the equations of motion .",
    "the first bps equation of motion states 2 e^-u ( e^-i ) = -h , [ bpseq1 ] where @xmath719 and the @xmath720 is the period vector with suitable normalization @xcite .",
    "another equation is _ 3 d = dh , h , [ bpseq2 ] where @xmath721 is the hodge star in @xmath97 , @xmath722 is a function with values in the even cohomology ( specifying d - brane charges ) of the calabi - yau manifold , and @xmath723 is the symplectic paring of the even cohomology , as in the main text .",
    "the function @xmath722 , which determines @xmath157 through , is a harmonic function with poles at the position @xmath717 of the charges .",
    "for @xmath265-centered black holes it is given by h()=_i=1^n -2 ( e^-i ) |_r=. [ eq.h ] the equation has a nonsingular solution if and only if the following integrability condition is satisfied : _",
    "j=1 , ji^n = 2(e^-iz(_i))|_r= , where we acted @xmath724 on both sides of and used the relation z(_i)=_i , .",
    "in particular , for 2-centered black holes this simplifies to r_12:=|_1-_2|=. |_r= = . |_r=. [ r12 ] since the distance between the center should clearly be positive , we have the condition _ 1,_2 ( z(_1 ) ) > 0 .",
    "[ denefstability ] which is sometimes called the denef stability condition .",
    "wall crossing occurs when @xmath725 goes to infinity .",
    "this is the case when z(_1)=c z(_2 ) , c@xmath726_+ .",
    "this coincides with the result of section[sec.wc ] .",
    "finally , the black hole carries the angular momentum j_12= _ ij_i,_j .",
    "in particular , for a two - centered configuration , j= .",
    "this is a classical result , but there is a quantum correction @xcite which modifies the result to j_12=. [ j12 ] this angular momentum plays crucial roles in the derivation of the primitive wall crossing formula in section[sec.wcfderivation ] .      in this appendix",
    "we briefly comment on the more general kontsevich - soibelman formula .",
    "since the formula itself is not needed in the rest of this paper , the discussion is brief and the interested readers are referred to the original papers @xcite for more information .",
    "let us start from the charge lattice @xmath41 , which is the even coholomogy of the calabi - yau manifold .",
    "we have a natural symplectic pairing @xmath727 on @xmath41 .",
    "consider a lie algebra with generators @xmath728 , satisfying the commutation relations = ( -1)^_1 , _ 2 _ 1 , _ 2 e__1+_2 .",

    ": e_ ( 1-(-1)^,e_)^, e_. [ uaction ]    as we have seen in section[sec.wc ] , on the generic walls of marginal stability the decay pattern is @xmath69 with @xmath730 . on both sides of the walls of marginal stability consider the product a:=_=n_1_1+n_2 _ 2 , n_1>0 , n_2>0^ u_^(;t ) , [ au ] where the ordering of the product is given by the clockwise ordering of the central charge @xmath731 .",
    "when we cross the wall of marginal stability , the ordering of the central charges changes , and also the bps invariants @xmath57 jumps . however , the wall crossing formula states that the whole product stays invariant : a(t_+)=a(t_- ) . where @xmath732 is the value of the khler moduli on different sides of the wall .",
    "let us derive the primitive wall crossing formula from the kontsevich - soibelman formula .",
    "for a decay @xmath64 with @xmath362 primitive , the wall crossing formula says u__1^(_1;t_+ ) u__1+_2^(_1+_2;t_+ ) u__2^(_2;t_+ ) = u__2^(_2;t_- ) u__1+_2^(_1+_2;t_- ) u__1^(_1;t_- ) .",
    "since what matters here is only the part generated by @xmath733 and @xmath734 , we consider a quotient of the lie algebra with all other generators .",
    "it is easy to see that this is consistent with the commutation relation .",
    "we have @xmath735 for @xmath736 because @xmath737 are primitive .",

    ", we consider the quotient algebra by @xmath742 with @xmath743 .",
    "this means that @xmath744 s commute each other in the quotient algebra .",

    "<S> this paper summarizes recent developments in the theory of bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) state counting and the wall crossing phenomena , emphasizing in particular the role of the statistical mechanical model of crystal melting .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is divided into two parts , which are closely related to each other . in the first part </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the statistical mechanical model of crystal melting counting bps states . </S>",
    "<S> each of the bps state contributing to the bps index is in one - to - one correspondence with a configuration of a molten crystal , and the statistical partition function of the melting crystal gives the bps partition function . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that smooth geometry of the calabi - yau manifold emerges in the thermodynamic limit of the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a remarkable interpretation that an atom in the crystal is a discretization of the classical geometry , giving an important clue as to the geometry at the planck scale .    </S>",
    "<S> in the second part we discuss the wall crossing phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> wall crossing phenomena states that the bps index depends on the value of the moduli of the calabi - yau manifold , and jumps along real codimension one subspaces in the moduli space . </S>",
    "<S> we show that by using type iia / m - theory duality , we can provide a simple and an intuitive derivation of the wall crossing phenomena , furthermore clarifying the connection with the topological string theory . </S>",
    "<S> this derivation is consistent with another derivation from the wall crossing formula , motivated by multi - centered bps extremal black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we also explain the representation of the wall crossing phenomena in terms of crystal melting , and the generalization of the counting problem and the wall crossing to the open bps invariants . </S>"
