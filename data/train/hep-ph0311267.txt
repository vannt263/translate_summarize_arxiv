    "soon after the discovery of asymptotic freedom , it has become common knowledge that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) under extreme conditions , such as high temperature and/or density , is a theory of weakly coupled quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "this phase of qcd , called the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , has attracted a considerable attention over the past few decades .    theoretically , it is imperative to establish the thermodynamic properties of qcd at finite temperature and density in order to confront the experimental data of the heavy - ion collision .",
    "the first principle lattice qcd calculations have revealed a great deal of information on the finite temperature phase transition(s ) between the hadronic phase and the qgp .",
    "an important task would be to correctly interpret in concrete physical terms what is going on during the rapid transition .    in qcd , at finite temperature",
    ", it is well known that there are two different phase transitions in different parameter regions ; the chiral phase transition in theories with massless quarks and the deconfinement phase transition in theories with infinitely heavy quarks . since the parameters of the real world are rather close to the chiral limit , chiral symmetry is often emphasized in constructing phenomenological models and describing the phase transition .",
    "one could argue that the deconfinement phase transition would have no definite meaning in this parameter region and could be forgotten altogether .    yet",
    "the word ` deconfinement ' is quite appealing .",
    "the qgp is often referred to as a deconfined phase .",
    "it is indeed tempting to interpret the rapid increase of the energy density observed in the lattice simulations as the liberation of the qcd degrees of freedom , or ` deconfinement ' .",
    "perhaps the reason of adherence to deconfinement or the deconfinement phase transition is not merely an intuitive one .",
    "since the early days of finite temperature qcd lattice simulations , it has been empirically known that the chiral phase transition and the deconfinement phase transition are tightly correlated although there seems to be no logical relation between them _ a priori _ @xcite . from these results",
    "one expects that some remnants of the deconfinement phase transition might be taken over by the chiral phase transition .    in this paper",
    ", we argue that the above expectation is correct . the chiral phase transition and",
    "the deconfinement phase transitions are just different limits of a single crossover phase transition .",
    "the key observations are the glueball - sigma mixing and the level repulsion which ` lock ' the two phase transitions @xcite .",
    "this helps dissolve the ambiguous issue of ` deconfinement ' and enables us to have a clearer picture of the nature of the finite temperature qcd phase transition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly review some basic facts about the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions and pose a ` puzzle ' long known in finite temperature lattice qcd simulations .",
    "section iii contains our main results .",
    "we present a possible scenario to explain the puzzle and argue that the phenomenon is a global feature of the qcd phase diagram in the ( @xmath0 ) plane ( @xmath1 is the temperature and @xmath2 is the current quark mass ) . in section iv , we speculate about qcd - like theories such as qcd with adjoint quarks and in the large @xmath3 limit .",
    "section v is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "the deconfinement phase transition is well defined only in theories with infinitely heavy quarks . above the critical temperature ,",
    "the polyakov loop @xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the path ordering operator and @xmath6 are the su(@xmath7 generators in the fundamental representation , develops a nonzero expectation value which breaks center symmetry . in an su(3 ) pure gauge theory the transition is known to be first order @xcite .",
    "when heavy quarks are added to the theory , the first order phase transition weakens .",
    "it eventually ends in a second order phase transition point where @xmath8 becomes continuous .",
    "the universality class of this phase transition is that of the three dimensional ising model . the critical quark mass at is estimated to be @xmath9 gev in the two - flavor lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "in contrast , chiral symmetry is a true symmetry only in theories with massless quarks .",
    "the order parameter of the chiral phase transition is the quark condensate @xmath10 . for three flavors ,",
    "the phase transition is first order @xcite . at finite but small quark mass ( which we take to be equal for all flavors ) , the first order transition persists and eventually ends in a second order phase transition point .",
    "the jump in the chiral condensate disappears and the scalar meson field @xmath11 ( with certain flavor content ) becomes gapless at this point @xcite .",
    "the location of and depends on the number of flavors and their mass ratios .",
    "[ for example , lies on the @xmath12 axis for two flavors . ]",
    "the argument in the next section does not depend on the details of the flavor sector , however .    from these basic facts alone",
    ", obviously there is no logical relation between the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions .",
    "various possibilities have been argued in the literature @xcite .",
    "a common argument is that , since confined vacuum necessarily breaks chiral symmetry @xcite , which suggests that the energy scale of the chiral symmetry breaking is higher than that of confinement , chiral symmetry restoration occurs at a somewhat higher temperature than deconfinement .",
    "[ see , however , @xcite .",
    "] this is in accord with our physical intuition ; it is easy to imagine massive constituent quarks but it is hard to imagine massless protons . if there were no lattice simulations at finite temperature , theorists would have drawn a phase diagram like fig .  [ 2 ] , incorporating what is known from the universality argument .",
    "naive phase diagram in the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) plane .",
    "the solid ( dotted ) lines denote the first order ( crossover ) phase transition . ]",
    "however , the realistic phase diagram obtained from the lattice simulations , fig .",
    "[ fig ] , is qualitatively different from our naive expectation @xcite .",
    "first , the critical temperature of the deconfinement phase transition in the pure gauge theory @xmath13 mev is _ invariably higher _ than that of the chiral phase transition in the chiral limit @xmath14 mev .",
    "[ one may think that it is meaningless to compare these two numbers because they are defined in completely different theories .",
    "however , this is a suggestive result and can be naturally explained within our scenario . ]",
    "the more striking fact is that the pseudocritical temperatures determined from the peak position of the susceptibility of each order parameter ( dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) appear to coincide for _ all _ values of the quark mass , which means that two crossover curves are smoothly connected at an intermediate point .",
    "it is as if the deconfinement phase transition in the pure gluonic theory is ` guided ' towards the chiral phase transition traveling over an infinite range of the quark mass .",
    "this is a surprising result .",
    "how can the deconfinement phase transition defined in a theory _ without _ quarks ` know ' about the chiral phase transition ?",
    "realistic phase diagram observed in lattice simulations . ]",
    "the interplay between the two phase transitions is an interesting problem .",
    "first gocksch and ogilvie have observed that what is responsible for the breaking of center symmetry is ( the inverse of ) the _ constituent _ quark mass rather than the current quark mass @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the polyakov loop and the sigma meson are closely coupled and the critical fluctuation of one field induces a singularity in the other field .",
    "more recent works @xcite further confirmed this interplay .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite and emphasized in @xcite , this argument alone is insufficient to explain the observed data . in fact , a stronger condition is needed to reproduce the phase diagram fig .",
    "[ fig ] . in this section",
    ", we will make a serious attempt to understand the physics behind fig .",
    "we shall divide our argument into three steps .",
    "although there is little doubt that the polyakov loop is the correct order parameter of the deconfinement phase transition in pure gauge theories , a perennial question about the physical meaning of the polyakov loop remains @xcite . in a word ,",
    "the polyakov loop is a fictitious excitation in euclidean space .",
    "it is true that , even in the presence of dynamical quarks , the behavior of the polyakov loop indicates a clear signal of the phase change .",
    "however , it seems that the above conceptual barrier has long been an obstacle to our satisfactory understanding of the phase transition in the presence of dynamical quarks .",
    "our first step is to propose an alternative characterization of the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "specifically , we wish to show that the _ glueball _ can equivalently describe the critical phenomena at .    for this purpose , first we work in the pure su(2 ) gauge theory . in this case",
    "the deconfinement phase transition is second order @xcite whose universality class is that of the three dimensional ising model .",
    "the string tension ( ` mass ' of the polyakov loop ) @xmath15 goes to zero smoothly as the critical temperature is approached @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the reduced temperature and the universal exponent is @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the infinite correlation of the polyakov loop entails a massless mode in physical excitations .",
    "this can be seen by considering the specific heat @xmath19 .",
    "near the critical point , the singular part of the specific heat may be represented by @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the spatial dimension . of the ginzburg - landau model . ]",
    "the subscript c denotes the connected part .",
    "is real for su(2 ) and @xmath23 stays nonzero at any temperature . ] in the theory of critical phenomena , the original dimension of an operator has no meaning .",
    "the polyakov loop is dimensionless , but it has nothing to do with the actual _ scaling dimension _ which enters in the calculation of correlation functions .",
    "the scaling dimension of the order parameter squared is @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "thus the explicit structure of the divergence is @xmath25 where we have assumed that the connected part of the correlator in ( [ c ] ) exponentially decays as @xmath26 at large distances . matching the powers of @xmath27 and using josephson s law @xmath28 ( hyperscaling ) , we obtain , @xmath29 hence the operator @xmath30 excites , among other states , at least one state with zero screening mass at the phase transition . by using an su(2 )",
    "identity @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the polyakov loop in the adjoint representation ( i.e. , the generators @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) are replaced by those in the adjoint representation ) , or just by noticing that @xmath30 is invariant under the center transformation , @xmath34 , we see that the massless state is the @xmath35 glueball . should be called the ` gluelump ' instead of the glueball @xcite .",
    "however , we expect that the difference ( if any ) dissolves at the deconfinement phase transition point . on the lattice",
    ", the specific heat is measured from the integrated correlator of plaquettes which excite glueballs .",
    "since the two expressions of the specific heat should give the correct singularity , the gluelump and the glueball must be the same excitation near the phase transition . ] eq . ( [ ttt ] ) is a trivial consequence of the scaling property at general second order phase transition points ; the only relevant scale is the correlation length @xmath36 .",
    "nevertheless , in the present case it is a nontrivial relation ensuring the vanishing of the mass gap in physical excitations as opposed to the polyakov loop which has no particle interpretation in minkowski space - time .",
    "note that although the polyakov loop and the glueball become massless with the same critical exponent @xmath37 , their susceptibilities diverge with different critical exponents ; @xmath38 for the glueball and @xmath39 for the polyakov loop ( the order parameter ) .",
    "[ compare with the su(3 ) case below . ] a significant decrease of the @xmath35 glueball screening mass near the su(2 ) deconfinement transition has been observed on the lattice @xcite . + one might suspect that the vanishing of the glueball mass would contradict with the presence of the trace anomaly . in the simple phenomenological potential of glueballs at zero temperature @xcite , the glueballs acquire their mass entirely from the trace anomaly , or the gluon condensate .",
    "@xmath40 since we do expect that the trace anomaly persists at any temperature , this appears to contradict with our assertion . however , the foundation of this objection is obscure .",
    "first , the exact lattice sum rule for the glueball mass @xcite shows that only @xmath41 of the glueball mass comes from the expectation value of the trace anomaly in the glueball state measured _ relative _ to the vacuum .",
    "although it might be useful for certain purposes , eq .",
    "( [ glu ] ) can not be taken seriously in our context . secondly , as observed in @xcite , the symmetry organizing the glueball spectrum changes near the critical temperature of both the su(2 ) and su(3 ) pure gauge theories .",
    "at low temperatures , the zero temperature symmetry is dynamically realized in the glueball spectrum @xcite . near the phase transition ,",
    "the zero temperature symmetry is superseded by the finite temperature one where the inclusion of the timelike links in interpolating operators makes a drastic change in the screening masses .",
    "the glueballs which become massless at the phase transition are the ` electric ' glueballs ( those containing @xmath42 , or time - like links ) , while the ` magnetic ' glueballs ( composed of @xmath43 , or space - like links ) remain massive .",
    "this crucial difference has been overlooked in most phenomenological approaches .",
    "[ see , however , @xcite .",
    "] finally , but most cogently , eq .",
    "( [ ttt ] ) is true for any second order phase transition .",
    "if all the glueballs were massive at the phase transition , the specific heat would be finite .",
    ", the correct singularity in the specific heat has not been confirmed on the lattice so far .",
    "see , however , @xcite . ]",
    "this is a catastrophe because it means that the apparent singularity in the polyakov loop has nothing to do with thermodynamics and there is no ( second order ) phase transition .",
    "+ let us go back to the end - point of su(3 ) qcd with dynamical quarks .",
    "since center symmetry is explicitly broken by dynamical quarks , the polyakov loop acquires a nonzero expectation value @xmath44 at .",
    "thus the phase transition at can be characterized by the infinite correlation length ( or the vanishing screening mass ) of the shifted polyakov loop @xmath45 using @xmath46 as an order parameter , one can construct a ginzburg - landau theory near and discuss the singular behavior of various susceptibilities .",
    "however , due to our identification @xmath47 the @xmath48 glueball field @xmath49 contains a linear term in @xmath46 .",
    "hence the screening mass of the polyakov loop which vanishes at is equal to the screening mass of the glueball , and we may as well construct a ginzburg - landau theory of @xmath50 around . note that this is a direct consequence of the explicit breaking of center symmetry .",
    "unlike the su(2 ) case , the glueball qualifies as an order parameter field ; its susceptibility diverges with the exponent @xmath51 .",
    "the two descriptions of the critical phenomena at , with the polyakov loop or with the glueball , are equivalent . in the presence of dynamical quarks ,",
    "the singular behavior of the polyakov loop represents the character change of the glueball .",
    "since the latter admits a direct physical interpretation , we will exclusively focus on the glueball in the following .",
    "the next step is a rather trivial , but important observation .",
    "_ in the presence of dynamical quarks , the glueballs must mix with the @xmath52 states_. in fact , the correct massless mode associated with the second order phase transition at is a linear combination of the pure glueball field @xmath50 and the scalar meson field @xmath53 with large glueball content , @xmath54 the other linear combination with large sigma meson content , @xmath55 is massive , hence decouples at .    the mixing eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) is physically obvious , and it is again a consequence of the explicit breaking of center symmetry . in the language of critical phenomena , the ginzburg - landau potantial has the following expansion , @xmath56g'+o(g'^2)+o(g'^3)+o(g'^4 ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) is the location of , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are smooth functions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "the coefficient of the linear term is unchanged up to a multiplicative constant . ]",
    "the equation of the tangential line at is given by @xmath62 which are in general not parallel ( @xmath63 ) to the mass axis in the absence of symmetry .",
    "the linear dependence on @xmath2 in the coefficient of @xmath46 makes the chiral susceptibility @xmath64 divergent with the same exponent @xmath39 as the polyakov loop susceptibility , the glueball field susceptibility and the specific heat .",
    "is very large , the mixing is weak and it would be difficult to observe the singularity of @xmath65 in numerical simulations @xcite . ]    in the same way , near the glueball field mixes with the sigma meson field which is critical . the simultaneous enhancement of the chiral susceptibility and the polyakov loop susceptibility along _ each _ crossover phase transition line is a natural consequence of the mixing @xcite .",
    "the coincidence of the peak positions is trivial .",
    "it is not a puzzle .",
    "it is just an evidence of the glueball - sigma mixing .",
    "the real puzzle of the lattice data is that there is only _",
    "one _ such coincidence in the @xmath66 plane .",
    "namely , the mixing eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) alone does not exclude the phase diagram fig .  [ 2 ] in which the coincidence occurs _ twice _",
    ", first at the deconfinement phase transition and then at the chiral phase transition .",
    "so what is going on in fig .",
    "[ fig ] ?",
    "the last step of our argument is a possible bridge between the two phase transitions .",
    "we have defined the @xmath67 field eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) as the correct massless field at the end - point of the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "on the other hand , since the massive @xmath68 field has a large meson component there , naively we expect that it becomes critical ( massless ) at the end - point of the chiral phase transition .",
    "this is what has been implicitly assumed to occur . however , this innocent - looking assumption is the principal cause of our confusion .",
    "the two phase transitions are caused by _",
    "different _ fields .",
    "why do the two crossover lines meet ?",
    "the crucial difference between fig .",
    "[ 2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig ] is that in fig .",
    "[ fig ] , _ both phase transitions are caused by the @xmath67 field_. since the critical field at should be predominantly the sigma meson , this is possible only if the mixing angle changes from @xmath69 to @xmath70 in an intermediate region of the quark mass .",
    "such a continuous variation of the mixing angle is typical of a _ level repulsion _ in quantum mechanics .",
    "thus we have reached a novel scenario of the finite temperature qcd phase transition : _ due to a level repulsion between the @xmath67 and the @xmath68 fields , the @xmath67 field continues to be the lightest field for all values of the quark mass .",
    "simultaneous divergences and peaks in various susceptibilities are simply caused by the dropping of the @xmath67 field screening mass .",
    "_ this gives a natural explanation to the otherwise puzzling lattice result , fig .",
    "note that the somewhat counterintuitive ordering 280 mev @xmath71 170 mev mentioned in section ii is also a natural consequence of our scenario .",
    "generally , a crossover line extends to the direction opposite to the symmetry broken phase .",
    "if the phase transition is second order in the absense of external fields , even the equation of the crossover line is determined by the universality class up to a multiplicative constant .",
    "the point is that center symmetry is broken in the _ high _ temperature phase .",
    "this is a quite unusual phenomenon but is true for su(@xmath3 ) pure gauge theories .",
    "thus , if the two phase crossover lines are smoothly connected by our scenario , the critical temperature of the deconfinement phase transition in the pure gauge theory must be larger than that of the chiral phase transition in the chiral limit .",
    "+ we now argue that our level repulsion scenario is not an _ ad hoc _ idea just to explain the observed data , but rather a global feature of the qcd phase diagram in the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) plane .",
    "consider _ zero _ temperature qcd .",
    "for small values of the quark mass , the sigma meson is a broad resonance whose mass is about 600 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass of the lowest glueball state ( which mixes with nearby quarkonium states ) is about 1.6 gev .",
    "if the quark mass is sent to infinity , the sigma meson mass goes to infinity , while the glueball mass stays more or less the same .",
    "naively , this implies that there is a level crossing between the two states at an intermediate value , roughly half the glueball mass @xmath72 mev , of the quark mass .",
    "however , in a quantum mechanical system , quite generally levels with the same quantum numbers can not cross unless certain matrix elements accidentally vanish . therefore , what actually takes place is a level repulsion .",
    "under this assumption at @xmath73 ( which seems to be reasonable to us ) , the level repulsion would continue to take place in the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) plane up to the crossover phase transition and our scenario would be realized .",
    "field were the order parameter at , there must have been a level crossing between the @xmath67 and @xmath68 fields . generally , in a two - parameter space ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , a level crossing occurs along a line simply because of a geometrical reason @xcite .",
    "therefore , this ( conventional ) scenario would lead to a level crossing at zero temperature , which is again unlikely . ]",
    "thus the glueball - sigma mixing and the level repulsion provide not only a unified description of the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions , but also a consistent characterization of the entire qcd phase diagram in the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) plane .",
    "[ phase ] is a schematic plot of the lowest scalar screening mass below the crossover phase transition in our scenario .",
    "the two phase transitions are indistinguishable . roughly speaking , they are the same phase transition . at",
    "about @xmath74 800 mev , there is a smooth change of the degrees of freedom , i.e. , mesons at smaller @xmath2 to glueballs at larger @xmath2 , in the low energy effective theory of qcd at _ any _ temperature at least up to the crossover phase transition . in section iv , we will see another possible example of the level repulsion .",
    "+     the lowest screening mass @xmath75 [ gev ] in the scalar channel below the crossover phase transition . at small @xmath2 ,",
    "the scalar channel is dominated by the sigma meson @xmath53 . at large @xmath2",

    "basically our argument does not change at nonzero baryon / isospin chemical potential . the interplay between the sigma and the glueball ( or the polyakov loop ) continues to exist @xcite .",
    "the only new feature is that as the qcd critical point is approached , the baryon number density begins to mix with the scalar mode and the baryon number susceptibility diverges with the same critical exponent as the chiral susceptibility @xcite .",
    "lattice simulations @xcite as well as model calculations @xcite have shown that , in qcd with adjoint quarks , the chiral phase transition occurs at a distinctly higher temperature than the deconfinement phase transition . here",
    "we analyze this problem from our point of view . for simplicity , we work in @xmath76 .",
    "since adjoint quarks do not break center symmetry , the second order deconfinement phase transition persists for all values of the quark mass .",
    "the effect of the adjoint quarks is simply to modify the coefficients of the ginzburg - landau potential @xmath77 . near a critical point ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) on the critical line",

    "this means that although the glueball and the sigma meson are massless on the critical line , they are distinct from the polyakov loop whose susceptibility diverges with the exponent @xmath51 .",
    "the mixing between the polyakov loop and the sigma meson is prohibited by center symmetry . on the other hand , at the chiral phase transition the chiral susceptibility diverges with the exponent @xmath51 . may be different from that at the deconfinement phase transition depending on the universality class . ] clearly , the two phase transitions can not be simultaneous . interestingly , even in this case there is a level repulsion ( or a level crossing ) between the two phase transitions .",
    "since the critical line is almost parallel to the quark mass axis ( @xmath83 ) for small @xmath2 , the amplitude of the singular part of the chiral susceptibility is small .",
    "this means that the massless mode responsible for the @xmath82-divergence is predominantly the glueball . on the other hand ,",
    "the massless mode at the chiral phase transition is predominantly the sigma meson .",
    "naturally , we expect that there is a level repulsion between the sigma meson and the glueball at an intermediate temperature",
    ".      it is intriguing to consider the phase diagram for different values of @xmath3 than three and in the limit of infinite @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "lattice simulations have shown that , as @xmath3 increases , the first order deconfinement phase transition strengthens @xcite .",
    "this means that a smaller value of @xmath2 is needed to wash out the first order phase transition , i.e. , the point moves downward .",
    "since there does not seem to be anything special about three colors in our scenario , we expect that the point the point at some value of @xmath85 and the high and low temperature phases are separated by a single first order phase transition line for @xmath86",
    ".    however , the limit @xmath87 might be a different story .",
    "the critical temperature of the deconfinement phase transition is expected to be of the order of @xmath88 , while that of the chiral phase transition is controversial . if we regard @xmath89 as the chiral symmetry breaking scale ( @xmath90 is the pion decay constant ) , it is of the order of @xmath91 .",
    "our scenario appears to be incompatible with this scenario . on the other hand ,",
    "there are arguments that the chiral phase transition temperature can not grow with @xmath3 ; it is of the order of the @xmath92 meson mass @xmath93 .",
    "it is not our intention to go into the details of these arguments which have been considered by many people previously .",
    "here we just point out that at least our scenario breaks down in the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "this is because , in the usual power counting rule of large-@xmath3 qcd , the glueball - meson mixing strength vanishes like @xmath94 .",
    "in the absence of the mixing , the level repulsion is impossible and the ` unlocking ' of the two phase transitions could occur .    from our viewpoint",
    ", @xmath76 is special .",
    "the deconfinement phase transition in the pure gauge theory is second order .",
    "the ginzburg - landau theory of @xmath50 does not make sense at . nevertheless , the mixing between the polyakov loop and the glueball is possible when the dynamical quarks are added .",
    "another notable feature is that the phase transition on the ` quark side ' is driven by the @xmath95 diquark ( ` baryon ' ) at finite temperature and density .",
    "it is thus interesting to pursue a similar link ( glueball - sigma - diquark mixing ) in the phase diagrams of two - color qcd @xcite .",
    "based on the existing lattice data , we have proposed a novel scenario of the finite temperature qcd phase transition . the chiral phase transition at zero quark mass and the deconfinement phase transition at infinite quark mass are continuously connected by the glueball - sigma mixing and the level repulsion .",
    "this gives a precise meaning to the common but somewhat ambiguous statement :  in qcd at high temperature , quarks are deconfined and chiral symmetry is restored . \"    we have also argued that our scenario can be naturally embedded in the entire phase diagram in the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) plane ( fig .  [ phase ] ) . at",
    "any given value of the quark mass , the minimum of the @xmath67 field screening mass marks the well - defined onset of the qgp phase .",
    "+ although we believe that our scenario is the correct interpretation of the finite temperature lattice simulations , direct evidences are still lacking .",
    "the most convincing evidence would be obtained by the lattice qcd measurements of the glueball , the polyakov loop and the sigma meson screening masses along the crossover transition line . because of the mixing eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) , they are all equal along the line . in principle , the mixing between the sigma and the glueball could occur in the entire phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) .",
    "however , we expect that in most regions the mixing is too small to be observed .",
    "for example , well above the chiral phase transition temperature , for small @xmath2 , the sigma meson and the pions fall in a multiplet due to the restored chiral symmetry .",
    "the glueball mass is indeed different from the sigma mass in this region @xcite .",
    "also at low temperatures , for small @xmath2 , the glueball will primarily mix with nearby scalar quarkonium states . as argued in section iii , the strong mixing",
    "is expected to occur at rather large values of @xmath2 , say , @xmath96 mev .",
    "detailed analyses of the lowest and the second lowest screening masses in this region would confirm or exclude our scenario .",
    "for a deeper understanding of this phenomenon , it would be desirable to construct concrete models which embody the mixing mechanism . in models where the polyakov loop and the sigma are coupled in the effective potential ,",
    "the pseudocritical temperatures of the two phase transitions are more or less close to each other @xcite .",
    "however , it has been so far not successful to reproduce the complete ` locking ' of the two phase transitions .",

    "<S> we argue that the chiral phase transition and the deconfinement phase transition in finite temperature qcd are just different limits of a single crossover phase transition driven by the lightest scalar field which is a mixture of the glueball and the sigma meson . </S>",
    "<S> the key mechanism , the level repulsion between the sigma and the glueball , gives not only a unified description of the finite temperature phase transitions , but also a consistent characterization of the entire qcd phase diagram in the temperature - quark mass plane . </S>"
