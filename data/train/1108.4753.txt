    "differential cryptanalysis is the first statistical attack proposed for breaking iterated block ciphers .",
    "its publication  @xcite then gave rise to numerous works which investigate the security offered by different types of functions regarding differential attacks .",
    "this security is quantified by the so - called _ differential uniformity _ of the substitution box used in the cipher  @xcite .",
    "most notably , finding appropriate s - boxes which guarantee that the cipher using them resist differential attacks is a major topic for the last twenty years , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "power functions , _",
    "i.e. _ , monomial functions , form a class of suitable candidates since they usually have a lower implementation cost in hardware . also , their particular algebraic structure makes the determination of their differential properties easier . however , there are only a few power functions for which we can prove that they have a low differential uniformity .",
    "up to equivalence , there are two large families of such functions : a subclass of the quadratic power functions ( a.k.a .",
    "gold functions ) and a subclass of the so - called kasami functions . both of these families contain some permutations which are apn over @xmath1 for odd  @xmath10 and differentially @xmath11-uniform for even  @xmath10 . the other known power functions with a low differential uniformity correspond to `` sporadic '' cases in the sense that the corresponding exponents vary with  @xmath10  @xcite and they do not belong to a large class : they correspond to the exponents defined by welch  @xcite , by niho  @xcite , by dobbertin  @xcite , by bracken and leander  @xcite , and to the inverse function  @xcite . it is worth noticing that some of these functions seem to have different structures because they do not share the same differential spectrum . for instance , for a quadratic power function or a kasami function , the differential spectrum has only two values , _",
    "i.e. _ , the number of occurrences of each differential belongs to @xmath12 for some @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the inverse function has a very different behavior since its differential spectrum has three values , namely @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath11 and , for each input difference , there is exactly one differential which is satisfied four times .",
    "however , when classifying all functions with a low differential uniformity , it can be noticed that the family of all power functions @xmath8 over @xmath1 , with @xmath16 , contains several functions with a low differential uniformity .",
    "most notably , it includes the cube function and the inverse function , and also @xmath17 for @xmath10 odd , which is the inverse of a quadratic function . at a first glance",
    ", this family of exponents may be of very small relevance because the involved functions have distinct differential spectra .",
    "then , they are expected to have distinct structures .",
    "for this reason , one of the motivations of our study was to determine whether some link could be established between the differential properties of the cube function and of the inverse function .",
    "our work then answers positively to this question since it exhibits a general relationship between the differential spectra of @xmath8 and @xmath18 over @xmath1 .",
    "we also determine the complete differential spectra of some other exponents in this family .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec - boo ] recalls some definitions and some general properties of the differential spectrum of monomial functions .",
    "section  [ sec - ds ] then focuses on the differential spectra of the monomials @xmath8 .",
    "first , the differential spectrum of any such function is shown to be determined by the number of roots of a family of linear polynomials .",

    "it is expressed by means of some kloosterman sums , and explicitly computed using the work of carlitz  @xcite .",

    "the _ univariate degree _ of the polynomial @xmath23 is , as usual , the maximal integer value of its exponents .",
