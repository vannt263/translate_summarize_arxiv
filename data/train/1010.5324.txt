    "the study of the production of charmed hadrons in antiproton - proton ( @xmath12 ) collisions is of importance for the understanding of the strong force in the nonperturbative regime of qcd .",
    "the fair project at the gsi site has an extensive program aiming at a high - accuracy spectroscopy of charmed hadrons and at an investigation of their interactions with ordinary matter @xcite .",
    "presently little is known about such interactions and their knowledge is a prerequisite for investigating issues like in - medium properties of charmed hadrons , e.g. @xmath13-quarkonium dissociation and changes in properties of @xmath0 mesons due to chiral symmetry restoration effects on the light quarks composing these mesons .    in this contribution",
    "we present predictions for the charm - production reactions @xmath14 and @xmath15 close to their respective thresholds @xcite .",
    "the work builds on the jlich meson - baryon models for the reactions @xmath16",
    "@xcite and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the extension of those models from the strangeness to the charm sector follows a strategy similar to our recent work on the @xmath18 and @xmath19 interactions  @xcite namely by assuming as a working hypothesis su(4 ) symmetry constraints .",
    "we also compare our results with those of other model calculations in the literature @xcite . in some of these studies a quark - gluon description based on a factorization hypothesis of hard and soft processes @xcite is employed , while in others a non - perturbative quark - gluon string model is used , based on secondary regge pole exchanges including absorptive corrections  @xcite .",
    "the calculations of the charm - production reactions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are done in complete analogy to past investigations of the strangeness - production reactions @xmath16  @xcite and @xmath17 @xcite by the jlich group . in particular @xmath14",
    "is performed within a coupled - channel approach while for @xmath20 a dwba approach is employed .",
    "this allows us to take into account rigorously the effects of the initial ( @xmath12 ) and also of the final state interactions which play an important role for energies near the production threshold @xcite .    because of the known sensitivity of the results for the cross sections on the initial @xmath12 interaction we examine its effect by considering several variants of the @xmath21 potential .",
    "details of those potentials can be found in ref .",
    "here we just want to mention that they differ primarily in the elastic part where we consider variations from keeping only the longest ranged contribution ( one - pion exchange ) to taking a full g - parity transformed @xmath22 interaction as done in @xcite .",
    "all these models reproduce the total @xmath12 cross section in the relevant energy range and , in general , describe also data on integrated elastic and charge - exchange cross sections and even @xmath12 differential cross sections , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the microscopic charm - production processes are described by either meson exchange ( @xmath0 , @xmath23 ) in case of @xmath14 , or baryon exchange ( @xmath1 , @xmath24 ) for @xmath20 .",
    "the transition potentials are derived from the corresponding transitions in the strangeness - production channels ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) under the assumption of su(4 ) symmetry . in order to assess uncertainties in the model we study , in addition , the effect of replacing the meson - exchange transition potential by a charm - production mechanism derived in a quark model @xcite .",
    "predictions for the total reaction cross section for @xmath27 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . in the left panel",
    "the cross section is shown as a function of the excess energy @xmath28 so that we can compare it with the one for @xmath29 at the corresponding @xmath30 .",
    "the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] correspond to the @xmath12 model c @xcite .    obviously , and as expected , the cross section for @xmath31 production is smaller than the one for @xmath25 .",
    "but the difference is about one order of magnitude only .",
    "we display here also the results based on an adaption of the @xmath32 quark - gluon transition mechanism of ref .",
    "we scale the effective quark - gluon coupling strength , fixed in our study of @xmath33  @xcite , with @xmath34 using the constituent quark masses @xmath35 and @xmath36 , i.e. the same values as employed in our previous works in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as expected , we obtain cross sections that are of the same magnitude as those predicted in the meson - exchange picture though roughly a factor three smaller , cf . the dashed line in fig .  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we compare our predictions with those by other groups @xcite .",
    "our results are shown as bands in order to reflect the variation of the predictions when different isi s are used .",
    "the dark ( red ) shaded band and the ( blue ) grid correspond to results based on the meson - exchange and quark - gluon transition potentials , respectively .",
    "it is remarkable that our results differ drastically from those of the preceeding works .",
    "specifically , our cross sections are a factor 1000 larger than those given in @xcite and they are still about 100 times larger than the ones in @xcite .",
    "thus , even when considering the variation of about a factor ten due to the isi that we see in our results and the uncertainties due to the unconstrained fsi and form factors in the transition potential that amount to roughly a factor three @xcite , we are faced with an impressive qualitative difference .",
    "our predictions for the reaction @xmath20 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "let us first focus on the effects of the inital- and final state interaction .",
    "the transition from @xmath12 to @xmath37 is generated by the exchange of charmed baryons , in particular the @xmath1 and @xmath24 . under the assumption of @xmath38 symmetry",
    "the pertinent coupling constants are given by @xmath39 where we assumed for the f/(f+d ) ratio @xmath40 .",
    "thus , one expects that @xmath1 exchange dominates the transition while @xmath24 exchange should be suppressed .",
    "specifically , this implies that @xmath41 .",
    "indeed , within the born approximation the cross sections predicted for @xmath42 are more than two orders of magnitude larger than those for @xmath43 @xcite , cf .",
    "the dotted lines fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "( the curves for @xmath42 are marked with a circle .",
    ") however , once the isi is included the situation changes drastically and now both channels are produced at a comparable rate ( dashed lines ) .",
    "in fact , now the cross section for @xmath43 is even somewhat larger than the one for @xmath42 .",
    "the inclusion of the fsi modifies the predictions once again , though only on a quantitative level .    on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we compare our predictions with those by other groups . here",
    "our results are shown as a shaded band for @xmath43 and as grid for @xmath42 .",
    "again the bands represent the variation of the predictions when different isi s are used .",
    "displayed are also the predictions by kroll et al .",
    "@xcite ( dash - dotted line ) , kaidalov @xcite ( dotted line ) and by kerbikov @xcite ( circle ) . obviously , and unlike in the @xmath31 case ,",
    "now the majority of the predictions are pretty much comparable , at least on a qualitative level .",
    "we have presented results for the reaction @xmath44 of a model calculation performed within the meson - exchange picture in close analogy to the jlich analysis of the reaction @xmath33 utilizing @xmath38 symmetry .",
    "the predicted cross sections are in the order of 1  7 @xmath11 .",
    "thus , they are about 10 - 100 times smaller than those for @xmath33 . however , and surprisingly , our predictions turned out to be about 1000 times larger than those obtained in other model calculations .",
    "we presented also predictions for @xmath45 obtained in the same spirit , i.e. by connecting this reaction with @xmath46 via @xmath38 symmetry . here",
    "the cross sections were found to be in the order of @xmath9 ",
    "@xmath10 @xmath11 and they turned out to be comparable to those predicted by other model calculations ."
