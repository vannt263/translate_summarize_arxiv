    "a transfer of a few nucleons during the reaction process plays an important role in heavy - ion sub - barrier fusion reactions @xcite .",
    "the coupling to a transfer degree of freedom is in general weaker than couplings to collective excitations .",
    "however , when the coupling is sufficiently large , _ e.g. , _ for a transfer channel with a positive @xmath4-value , it is expected that the transfer coupling leads to an extra enhancement of fusion cross sections below the coulomb barrier @xcite .",
    "it has been known well that two - neutron transfer reactions provide a unique tool to study the pair correlation between nucleons @xcite . recently",
    "two experiments for heavy - ion transfer reactions have been carried out at energies far below the coulomb barrier @xcite in order to study the relation between the transfer of one neutron and that of a pair of neutrons .",
    "see also refs .",
    "the experimental data show an enhancement of the two - neutron transfer cross sections compared to a simple estimate based on the independent picture , that is , a square of the transfer probability of one neutron .",
    "several theoretical studies have been performed in order to understand the reaction dynamics of the pair transfer process .",
    "those include the time - dependent perturbation theory based on the semi - classical approximation @xcite , the second - order distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) @xcite , and the semi - classical @xcite and the quantal @xcite coupled - channels approaches .",
    "recently , the time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) has also been employed to investigate the transfer reaction .",
    "an advantage of this method is that the formalism takes into account simultaneously the structure and the dynamics .",
    "although this method reproduces the individual transfer of nucleons @xcite , the enhancement factor of a two - neutron transfer probability is underestimated with this method @xcite even if the pairing correlation is taken into account @xcite .",
    "this implies a necessity to go beyond the mean - field dynamics with pairing in order to take into account all the remaining correlations @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we carry out a phenomenological study in order to understand the transfer dynamics using the formalism of the semi - classic and the quantal coupled - channels approaches .",
    "our aim in this paper is twofold .",
    "one is to understand the reaction dynamics of the two - neutron transfer reactions .",
    "we emphasize that the reaction dynamics is so complicated that many microscopic approaches still lack of prediction for the two - neutron transfer .",
    "in particular , the nature of the two - neutron transfer reaction , that is , the relative importance between the direct and sequential processes , is still under discussions @xcite .",
    "the second aim of this paper is to describe subbarrier fusion reactions using the transfer coupling form factors which are consistent with the transfer cross sections . for these purposes , we phenomenologically adjust the parameters in the form factors for the transfer couplings , rather than computing them microscopically .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we employ the semi - classical time - dependent coupled - channels method and discuss the sequential and the direct natures of the two - neutron transfer process . in sec .",
    "iii , we use the transfer coupling form factors obtained in sec .",
    "ii to discuss the role of absorption in the two - neutron transfer reactions .",
    "in particular , we investigate the interplay between the transfer and the fusion processes using the quantal coupled - channels approach .",
    "we then summarize the paper in sec .",
    "since the experimental transfer cross sections are often analyzed using the semi - classical method @xcite , we first employ it to investigate the nature of the two - neutron transfer .    with the semi - classical approximation to coupled - channels equations",
    ", one assumes a rutherford trajectory for the relative motion @xmath5 between the colliding nuclei .",
    "this yields a time - dependent field for the intrinsic motions in the projectile and the target nuclei .",
    "that is , the nuclear intrinsic wave function is expanded as @xmath6 , @xmath7 corresponding to the entrance channel , and it is then evolved in time as @xmath8 with @xmath9 . here",

    "for the transfer problem , @xmath13 corresponds to the number of transferred nucleons . by truncating the transfer channels at @xmath17 , the coupling hamiltonian @xmath18 reads , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the transfer @xmath4-value for each partition , @xmath13 . for the coupling form factor @xmath21",

    "we find that the solutions for the coupled - channels equations are numerically more stable with the parametrization given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling ] ) .    in the actual calculations presented below",
    ", we use @xmath28 fm , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the mass numbers for the target and the projectile nuclei , respectively .",
    "we start the time - dependent schrdinger equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdcc ] ) , at at an initial distance @xmath31 fm where the coupling is negligible .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we evaluate the time dependence of the coupling form factor @xmath32 by averaging the two rutherford trajectories , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , as @xmath35 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are evaluated with the energy of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively . in order to avoid a dependence of the results on the initial position , @xmath38 , all the trajectories",
    "are arranged so that the distance of the closest approach is reached at the same time , @xmath39 .",
    "we follow the time evolution until the two fragments are separated with a distance of 30 fm .",
    "we have checked that the coupling among the channels are practically negligible after this distance , and thus the transfer probabilities are not altered .    in order to reduce the number of adjustable parameters , we employ two different schemes .",
    "the first scheme corresponds to a pure sequential process , for which we set @xmath40 to be zero while @xmath41 and @xmath42 are allowed to be different . on the other hand",
    ", the second scheme corresponds to a direct two - neutron transfer process , for which we set @xmath43 but @xmath44 in general .",
    "the enhancement of two - neutron transfer process is explained in a different way with these two schemes . in the pure sequential transfer scheme ,",
    "the enhancement factor is due to the increase of the probability for the transfer of the second neutron after the first neutron is transferred , that is , @xmath45 . on the other hand , in the direct transfer scheme , the enhancement is due to the additional coupling between the entrance and the two - neutron transfer channels .",
