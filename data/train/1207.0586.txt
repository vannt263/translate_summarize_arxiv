    "one goal of the inverse scattering problem is to find the shape of bulk or flaw in a medium using the scattered field data measured at the boundary .",
    "this is an old but it has several of applications such as detection of cracks in material engineering , ultrasound imaging in medical sciences , and scanning anti - personnel mines hidden in the ground in military services . related researches may be found in @xcite and the references therein . in many studies , various shape reconstruction algorithms",
    "have been developed , most of which are focused on the minimization of the least - square functional by using a newton - type iteration strategy , e.g. , level - set method @xcite .",
    "the merits of the iteration strategy is that it does not require a very large number of boundary measurements for complete shape reconstruction ; instead , in order to guarantee successful reconstruction , it demands very high computational expenditures , optimal regularization terms related to the problems at hand , calculation of a complex frchet derivative at each iteration , and _ a priori _ information of the unknown target to be reconstructed .",
    "nevertheless , even if these conditions are satisfied , the iteration strategy must begin with an initial guess that is close to the true one in order to avoid undesirable situations such as non - convergence or falling into the local minima .",
    "therefore , development of a mathematical theory and an algorithm for generating a good initial guess is an important research topic .",
    "conversely , certain non - iterative shape reconstruction algorithms have been proposed ; for example , multiple signal classification ( music ) algorithm @xcite , linear sampling method @xcite , kirchhoff migration @xcite , and fourier inversion based one @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the iterative strategy , these algorithms require a large amount of incident field data and a significant number of boundary measurements .",
    "however , if these conditions are satisfied , non - iterative shape reconstruction algorithms can prove to be effective , fast , and easy to extend to multiple targets .",
    "topological derivative concept is a non - iterative strategy .",
    "this concept was originally developed for the shape optimization problem , but its application to rapid shape reconstruction has only recently been proven .",
    "related works can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "one of the advantages of topological derivative concept is that it does not require a large amount of many incident field data ; however , a reduction in the amount of this data has been reported to result in poor resolution of the reconstructed shape .",
    "the purpose of this literature is to establish an effective and fast reconstruction algorithm for detecting both the location and shape of perfectly conducting crack(s ) from boundary - measured scattered field data by using only a small amount of incident field data .",
    "based on the structure of topological derivative imaging functional operated at a fixed - frequency @xcite and multi - frequency imaging schemes @xcite , we introduce a multi - frequency topological derivative concept .",
    "note that recent work ( * ? ? ?",
    "* formula ( 1.33 ) ) has briefly introduced a multi - frequency topological derivative but through a more detailed analysis , we investigate the structure of the proposed multi - frequency topological derivative and its benefits over the traditional topological derivative .",

    "section [ sec2 ] briefly introduces the traditional topological derivative by creating a linear , narrow crack .",
    "section [ sec3 ] describes the design of a multi - frequency topological derivative imaging function and analyzes it to investigate its properties .",

    "<S> this paper concerns a fast , one - step iterative technique of imaging extended perfectly conducting cracks with dirichlet boundary condition . in order to reconstruct the shape of cracks from scattered field data measured at the boundary </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a topological derivative - based electromagnetic imaging function operated at several nonzero frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the imaging function are carefully analyzed for the configurations of both symmetric and non - symmetric incident field directions . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis explains why the application of incident fields with symmetric direction operated at multiple frequencies guarantees a successful reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> various numerical simulations with noise - corrupted data are conducted to assess the performance , effectiveness , robustness , and limitations of the proposed technique .    perfectly conducting cracks , topological derivative , multiple frequencies , numerical experiments </S>"
