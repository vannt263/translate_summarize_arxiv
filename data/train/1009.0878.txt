    "one of the major puzzles of neuroscience is how neurons can store , process , and compute despite the fact that the brain is extremely noisy @xcite . understanding the evolved mechanisms and the associated non - linear dynamics that allow the neurons to function in  and even exploit  a noisy environment is an essential step towards gaining insight into the information transmission and communication networks in the brain .",
    "such studies also have important implications beyond the domain of biophysics and neuroscience .",
    "noise provides a critical barrier for the development of sensitive electronic and mechanical devices , particularly at the nanoscale @xcite .",
    "increasingly , researchers are focusing on exploring innovative , non - traditional device design and control strategies that exploit the ambient noise @xcite . in this regard , there are clear advantages to understanding how nature has managed to harness noise in a setting whose primary ( apparent ) function is to manage information .",
    "it is generally accepted that neurons communicate with each other using sharp electric pulses referred to as action potentials or spikes .",
    "each neuron is connected to several other neurons , and will only generate a spike output when the integrated input from other neurons exceeds a certain threshold @xcite .",
    "a startling discovery that ( under certain circumstances ) neurons can spike more regularly when stimulated by noise @xcite led to assertions that noise is inherent to neuron function .",
    "several subsequent experimental and theoretical studies were aimed at elucidating the functionality of neural noise @xcite . in the first instance , noise  as expected  introduces a variability in the interspike intervals and degrades the information capacity of the spike trains , with low contrast signals being most affected @xcite . at the same time",
    ", these studies also found that stochastic resonance provides a mechanism for neurons to take advantage of their own noise .",
    "in stochastic resonance , the addition of an appropriate amount of noise in a non - linear system can induce regularity by sensitizing subthreshold excitations , thus providing the extra energy for them to reach threshold @xcite and enabling their detection .",
    "additionally , brunel _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and svirskis @xcite have shown that a model neuron , when subjected to low frequency noise , is able to respond faster to a sudden excitation than in the absence of noise .",
    "for an animal living in a natural environment , the ability to react quickly to sudden threats can mean the difference between life and death .",
    "all of the studies to date that have considered the impact of low frequency noise on neurons tend to model noise characterized by a single lorentzian power spectrum",
    ". natural noise , however , has an ubiquitous @xmath0 frequency dependence @xcite . from current carrying electronic devices and geophysical time series to biological systems ,",
    "the @xmath0 power spectrum is everywhere . in biological settings , human hearing and speech @xcite , the response of biological photoreceptors to large intensity variation of visual image streams in nature @xcite ,",
    "the stride intervals time series of normal human gait @xcite , intrinsic noise in neuronal membranes due to stochastic opening and closing of the various ion channels @xcite , etc . all exhibit @xmath0 behavior .",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated how stochastic resonance induced by @xmath0 noise can increase the sensitivity of nanomechanical resonators , allowing for the possibility of fashioning them into noisy but robust nanoscale computation devices .",
    "neither the response nor the details of the underlying non - equilibrium behavior that makes neurons robust to natural ( @xmath0 ) noise is well understood .    in this paper , we present a comprehensive study of how neuron dynamics is affected by an arbitrary noise spectral density , and which sectors of the spectra are responsible for the beneficial functions that noise can provide .",
    "specifically , we explore whether neuron response under @xmath0 noise is significantly different from the one found in the presence of a simple lorentzian spectra .",
    "the relevance of low frequency noise , implied by a @xmath0 spectrum , to spike dynamics at the single neuron level is especially evident , as we shall argue , in the direct _ experimental _ measurements of the spike count fano factor by teich _",
    "et al._@xcite ( fano factor is the ratio between the variance and the mean spike number during a given observation time ) .",
    "these authors demonstrated that the fano factor of single neurons in the visual systems of cats and insects increases monotonically as a function of time .",
    "this is in dramatic contrast to the simple poisson model ( white noise ) , which leads to fano factor equal to one at all times . the monotonic rise is also incompatible with models based on lorentzian noise because the resulting fano factor saturates at times longer than the inverse lorentzian half width @xcite .",
    "we show that the characteristic non - ergodicity of @xmath0 noise explains why the fano factor never saturates in single neuron experiments",
    ". moreover , the rate at which the fano factor grows as a function of time is different for @xmath0 and lorentzian .",
    "in addition , we consider the effect of @xmath0 noise on the reaction time of a neuron in response to a sudden stimulus .",
    "we demonstrate that @xmath0 noise is _ nearly optimal _ for speeding up neuron response .",
    "we provide an explanation for this effect that sheds light on the mechanism of neuron adaptation to their noisy environment .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ lif ] describes our model for the neuron : the leaky integrate and fire ( lif ) model of the neuron , and explains how we introduce @xmath0 noise and other spectral densities in this model .",
    "section  [ fanosec ] describes an analytical theory and a set of numerical simulations of the neuron fano factor as a function of time and compares our result to experiment @xcite .",
    "particularly notable is our general expression eq .",
    "( [ fnoise ] ) relating the fano factor to an integral over low frequency noise weighted by an appropriate filter function .",
    "section  [ suddensec ] addresses the question of how noise can provide a mechanism for neurons to respond faster to a sudden stimulus .",
    "section  [ concsec ] provides our concluding remarks .",
    "from a biophysical perspective , the classical hodgkin - huxley model @xcite and its contemporary variants represent the most realistic mathematical description of electrical response of a single neuron . due to their intrinsic complexity",
    ", however , such models render the theoretical and computational analysis of neuronal and neural network dynamics exceedingly difficult . for this reason ,",
    "most studies to date tend to reference the simpler spiking neuron models , of which the leaky integrate and fire ( lif ) model @xcite that we adopt is one .",
    "the lif model represents each neuron by an electrical circuit ; when appropriate circuit parameters and features are chosen , the lif model can reproduce quite similar dynamics to the one described by the more complex hodgkin - huxley model @xcite .",
    "the lif model consists of a capacitor @xmath2 in parallel with a resistor @xmath3 ; an injected continuous current @xmath4 models the spike input from a large number of neighboring neurons .",
    "the neuron ( or capacitor ) voltage @xmath5 is given by the circuit equation , @xmath6 a spike is generated whenever the voltage across the capacitor reaches a certain threshold @xmath7 ; after the spike is emitted , the neuron is reset to a zero voltage state .",
    "note how the threshold rule for spike generation introduces non - linearity in the lif model : consider two input currents @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; a neuron subject to input @xmath10 $ ] will generally reach threshold faster than a neuron that is subject to either @xmath8 or @xmath9 only .",
    "hence , the sum of outputs obtained from @xmath8 and @xmath9 applied separately is different from the output obtained from @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "also , the resistance @xmath3 plays an important role in the model : it allows charge to leak out , thus negating inputs received in the distant past .",
    "neurons have the property that inputs long past have less effect than recent inputs ; a sufficient amount of input must happen sufficiently rapidly for the neuron to fire .",
    "the version of the lif model that we are using has an additional feature that makes it more realistic : the introduction of a refractory time period @xmath11 , which models the physical reset time for a neuron after emitting a spike .",
    "this prevents the neuron from receiving input for a time @xmath11 after spiking .",
    "our choice for these circuit parameters are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the presence of a leak and a refractory period makes the lif neuron extremely hard to treat analytically @xcite . as a result , many theoretical studies have focused on the @xmath12 and @xmath13 limit , the so called perfect ( non - leaky ) integrate and fire model @xcite .",
    "this latter model is much easier to analyze but as we will demonstrate , the reduced complexity also leads to significantly different dynamics .",
    "we considered the lif model subject to a noisy input current of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a ( constant ) bias current , @xmath16 is the noise amplitude , and @xmath17 is the heaviside step function : @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 ; this ensures the current input represents the sum of spikes from a large number of connected neurons .",
    "the time series @xmath22 is a gaussian stochastic process , with variance equal to one and power spectra given by @xmath23 with the brackets @xmath24 denoting ensemble averages over a large number of time series @xmath22 .",
    "appendix a describes the method used to generate individual time series for any given noise spectral density @xmath25 .",
    "we considered a number of different noise densities , including the family of power law spectral densities @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an exponent ( @xmath28 corresponds to @xmath0 noise ) .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath29 is set by the condition for the variance to be one , @xmath30 [ in the case of @xmath28 eq .  ( [ aof ] ) is valid for @xmath31 ; @xmath32 is a lower cut - off for which @xmath33 saturates , and @xmath34 is an upper cut - off for which @xmath33 goes to zero faster than @xmath35  see below ] .",
    "another important class of noise spectral density arises when the environment fluctuates with a single characteristic time @xmath36 : @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "this is a lorentzian power spectrum and it implies @xmath39 .",
    "many authors refer to @xmath36 as the `` correlation time '' , and to the lorentzian spectra as `` time correlated noise '' . in the limit that @xmath40 goes to infinite ( @xmath41 )",
    ", @xmath42 is approximately constant for all @xmath43 .",
    "hence @xmath44 is the `` white noise '' limit .",
    "another important limit occurs when @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) : in this case @xmath47 , signaling a `` static '' limit .    it is useful to recall the basic physical picture for the origin of @xmath0 noise .",
    "it emerges from the combination of a large number of lorentzian fluctuators with an exponentially wide distribution of characteristic rates @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "for example , assume @xmath48 , with @xmath49 a random variable that represents a distribution of activation energies . assuming @xmath49",
    "is uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath50 $ ] we get @xmath51 when @xmath52 , we may approximate @xmath53 and @xmath54 ; this leads to @xmath55 where we used the fact that @xmath56 .",
    "hence , overall the resultant noise is well described by @xmath57 with constant @xmath58^{-1}$ ] .    from eq .",
    "( [ oofnoise1 ] ) we see that the distribution of lorentzian linewidths @xmath40 is given by @xmath59 .",
    "this is the reason why the spectrum acquires the @xmath0 dependence .",
    "we may generalize this distribution to @xmath60 , with @xmath27 a dimensionless exponent ; carrying though a similar derivation as in eq .",
    "( [ oofnoise1 ] ) leads to @xmath61 .",
    "this shows that deviations of the @xmath62 distribution will reflect directly into a @xmath63 exponent for the noise spectrum .",
    "usually , @xmath32 is exponentially small , and the experimental observation time window @xmath64 is _ smaller _ than @xmath65 . in this case",
    "the low frequency cut - off will be instead set by @xmath66 .",
    "as the observation time @xmath64 increases , more low frequency fluctuators will play a role ; as a result , @xmath0 noise has no characteristic time scale , and displays _ non - ergodic _ behavior ( time averages of observables are non - convergent , and can not be equivalent to ensemble averages ) .",
    "below we discuss how the non - ergodic property leads to an increasing neuron fano factor as a function of time .",
    "to compare lif dynamics under the effect of white and @xmath0 spectra , we considered noise in the superthreshold regime ( @xmath67  a ) .",
    "we assumed @xmath68  a , slightly above threshold , ensuring that without noise the neuron will spike every @xmath69  ms .",
    "for the cases with noise , we used @xmath70 .",
    "the algorithm of appendix a was used to generate a current input @xmath4 , and eq .",
    "( [ dvdt ] ) is integrated using the runge - kutta method",
    ". figures  [ fig : wtime1 ]  and  [ fig : ptime1 ] shows the neuron voltage as a function of time , for a particular time series ( the observation time window was @xmath71  s ) . under white noise ,",
    "the spiking remains quite regular over time , because @xmath4 varies rapidly and most of its fluctuating components are filtered out . on the other hand , @xmath0 noise shows a combination of long periods of inactivity , with the voltage taking a long time to reach threshold , together with periods of spike bursting where the voltage reaches threshold on a much shorter time scale .",
    "this is a result of the fact that under @xmath0 noise , the current tends to get `` stuck '' at either small or large values .",
    ".circuit parameters used in our lif model .",
    "the parameters are similar to the ones used to describe neurons in the cat s visual cortex ( chapter 14 of @xcite).[table1 ] [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure  [ fig : isi ] shows the interspike time interval histogram ( isi ) for a 100,000 ensemble of time series with the same parameters considered in figs .",
    "[ fig : wtime1 ]  and  [ fig : ptime1 ] . here",
    "we see that both types of noise can cause a notable decrease in the mean interspike time interval ( compare to the noiseless case of a constant bias current ) .",
    "however , 1/@xmath72 noise leads to a far more dramatic shift .",
    "a large portion of the interspike time histogram lies significantly below the noiseless interval , and a long tail is observed at large interspike times .",
    "this behavior is characteristic of bursting ( see e.g. chapter 16 of @xcite ) ; several spikes occur in rapid succession , followed by a longer period without spike activity .",
    "figure  [ fig : isi ] also shows the isi for two lorentzian noise spectra , with @xmath73  hz and @xmath74  hz , where @xmath71  s was the simulation time window for each time series .",
    "lorentzian noise with such low frequency leads to an isi that is nearly as broad as the @xmath0 noise case ; however , the lorentzian noise cases do not display the long time tail characteristic of @xmath0 noise .",
    "the simulations for @xmath73  hz can be compared to an exact analytical result obtained using the methods of refs .",
    "@xcite ( see appendix  [ appendixb ] ) . note how the @xmath73  hz simulations are in excellent agreement with the exact result .",
    "the fano factor is defined by@xcite @xmath75^{2}\\rangle}{\\langle n(t)\\rangle } , \\label{fano}\\ ] ] where the random variable @xmath76 is the number of spikes generated from @xmath77 to @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "hence , the fano factor measures the amount of uncertainty in the spike train at a given time @xmath80 .",
    "a noiseless spike train with identical interspike time intervals yields @xmath81 .",
    "in contrast , consider the case that the spike events are uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath82 $ ] : in this case the probability for a spike event to happen during a time interval @xmath83 $ ] is independent of @xmath84 and given by @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the mean firing rate .",
    "then the resulting @xmath76 is a poisson random variable uncorrelated in time ( white noise ) with @xmath87 , leading to @xmath88 at all times . in the presence of low frequency noise",
    ", @xmath89 is known to become larger than one @xcite .",
    "the observation of a fano factor much larger than one rules out the simple poisson model , and suggests the presence of long time correlations in the data @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived an analytic expression for the fano factor of the perfect ( @xmath12 ) integrate and fire model subject to lorentzian noise [ eq  ( [ lornoise ] ) ] . at times much longer than the average interspike interval their result becomes @xmath90 , \\label{fanoanaly}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the current variance , @xmath92 is the bias current , @xmath36 is the correlation time of the lorentzian noise , @xmath2 is the capacitor s voltage , and @xmath93 is the threshold voltage .",
    "we emphasize that eq .",
    "( [ fanoanaly ] ) assumes an input current @xmath94 , i.e. , it neglects the step function used in our numerical computations [ compare to eq .",
    "( [ currit ] ) ] .",
    "here we generalize this result to an arbitrary noise spectral density . an rc circuit with no leakage ( @xmath12 )",
    "will lead to a capacitor voltage @xmath95 that always increases with increasing time . in the case of the neuron , @xmath95 is reset to zero when it reaches the threshold @xmath7 . in other words ,",
    "the voltage is decreased by @xmath7 each time the neuron spikes . an equivalent way to treat",
    "this reset process is to instead _ increase the threshold _ by an additional @xmath7 each time the neuron spikes ; this allows us to count the number of spikes at a given time @xmath80 by simply dividing the monotonically increasing @xmath95 by @xmath7 .",
    "therefore the random variable @xmath76 is well approximated by @xmath96 this approximation is valid at long times , @xmath97 , i.e. times much longer than the mean interspike interval so that @xmath76 can be represented by a real number instead of an integer .",
    "the simplicity of the perfect integrate and fire model lies in the fact that we do not need to consider the threshold barrier explicitly .",
    "this property relies heavily on the fact that the voltage of an rc circuit never decreases when @xmath12 .",
    "it is worthwhile to show how the approximation eq .",
    "( [ ntapprox ] ) fails in the presence of any amount of leakage .    when @xmath98 , the mean voltage according to eq .",
    "( [ dvdt ] ) is given by @xmath99 .",
    "hence when @xmath100 the mean voltage saturates at @xmath101 , and the approximation of eq .",

    "for example , upon inserting @xmath112 we recover eq .",
    "( [ fanoanaly ] ) exactly .",

    "( [ fanost ] ) : @xmath114 where we defined the filter function by @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the `` unnormalized sinc function '' .",
    "hence the fano factor can be expressed as an integral over low frequency noise ; the filter function @xmath117 dictates how much noise is `` allowed in '' at each given time @xmath80 .",

    ", we have @xmath119 for all frequencies , and @xmath120 .",
    "this leads to a useful result @xmath121 therefore , the saturation of the fano factor ( or lack thereof ) at long times is directly proportional to the amount of zero frequency noise .",
    "we can use eq .",
    "( [ fanost ] ) to find the neuron fano factor subject to @xmath0 noise . from eq .",
    "( [ oofnoise1 ] ) we know that the time correlation function for @xmath0 noise can be written as @xmath122 hence the fano factor for @xmath0 noise can be written as a weighted average of lorentzian fano factors , @xmath123\\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx & \\frac{2i_{1}^{2}}{c v_{\\rm{th}}i_0 } \\frac{1}{\\ln{\\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{\\rm{max}}}{\\gamma_{\\rm{min}}}\\right ) } }   \\frac{t}{2 } \\left [ \\frac{(3 - 2 c_e)}{2 }   -\\ln{\\left(\\gamma_{\\rm{min}}t \\right ) } \\right ] , \\label{fanooneoverf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "the latter approximation is valid for @xmath125 , where @xmath64 is the experimental time window .",
    "hence @xmath126 increases monotonically with increasing time , until it reaches a saturation value around @xmath127 .",
    "this saturation value , however , is artifact of the finite length @xmath64 of the experiment ; it diverges as @xmath128 , i.e. , when longer data sets are acquired .",
    "this effect is a manifestation of the non - ergodicity of @xmath0 noise . in stark contrast , for an experimental window @xmath129 , the fano factor for the simple lorentzian noise saturates at @xmath130 , and remains at this value regardless of whether @xmath64 is increased further . assuming that this behavior carries over to the leaky model",

    "_ the response under @xmath0 noise lags behind the static case by only @xmath167  ms , i.e. , it is nearly optimal_. both static and @xmath0 noise reach their steady state much faster when compared to other types of noise .",
    "lorentzian noise with roll - off frequency @xmath168  hz is intermediate between white and @xmath0 noise .",
    "clearly , the response time improves as the noise gets dominated by low frequency components .    in order to elucidate the mechanism",
    "by which noise sensitizes neuron response time , we present two additional figures .",

    ", it takes approximately @xmath169  ms for 1% of the neurons to spike for the first time . on the other hand",
    ", it takes only @xmath170  ms for 1% of the @xmath0 noise neurons to spike and a mere @xmath171  ms for 1% of static noise ( i.e.  lorentzian @xmath73 ) neurons to spike for the first time .",
    "neurons subject to @xmath0 noise and the @xmath73 static noise have a much wider distribution of first spike times .",
    "some neurons spike almost immediately , while others take a long time to spike  note the extended tail in the distributions .",
    "this broad distribution implies a greater variability in the neuronal interspike interval and a degradation of any information coded therein .",
    "extreme low frequency noise ( @xmath0 and @xmath73 ) result in a trade off between reliability and rapid response .",
    "figure  [ fig : prestepvoltage ] sheds light on the origin of this effect , by plotting the distribution of neuron voltages just before the step stimulus is applied . here",
    "we see why the static case is optimal : the distribution of neuron voltages is nearly flat , and extends close to threshold .",
    "hence , when the stimulus is applied , a significant amount of `` primed neurons '' will reach threshold almost instantly . while the voltage distribution for @xmath0 noise is not flat , it is broad and extends all the way to high voltages .",
    "similar to the static case , the presence of a tail extending near threshold implies that a significant number of neurons are `` primed '' by @xmath0 noise ; these neurons will react nearly instantly to the stimulus .",
    "we note in passing that it is possible to engineer a lorentzian noise spectrum to yield a response time similar to that for @xmath0 noise via an appropriate choice of @xmath172 , where we recall that @xmath64 is the simulation time window . for @xmath71",
    "s , we find that @xmath173  hz does the trick , in agreement with expectations based on our previous analysis of the distribution of interspike time intervals for different conditions ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ fig : isi ] ) : the shortest interspike time interval for a lorentzian with @xmath173  hz is similar to that for @xmath0 noise .",
    "the two distributions are not identical .",
    "the isi for the @xmath0 has a tail that extends to much longer times .",
    "in conclusion , we presented analytical and numerical calculations of the perfect and the leaky integrate and fire neuron aimed at elucidating the impact of @xmath0 noise on single neuron dynamics . though more difficult to analyze than the perfect integrate and fire model that is commonly used in noise and network studies ,",
    "our lif model is a more realistic model of a neuron and as we have shown , the inclusion of the `` leakiness '' gives rise to much higher disorder .    with regard to the response of the lif to @xmath0 noise",
    ", we find a surprising dichotomy : while it degrades the ability to transmit information using interspike times , it manages to enhance the overall response time ( of an ensemble of neurons ) to a sudden stimulus by ensuring that a subset of neurons are primed with a near threshold voltage .    our explicit numerical simulations of neuronal response to a sudden step excitation elucidates the mechanism by which noise can enhance neuron response time .",
    "neuron response times were shown to be optimal under static noise ( noise sharply peaked at zero frequency ) because a large number of neurons are close to threshold just before the step stimulus arrives .",
    "this select group of neurons act as the alarm bells : they respond almost instantly to the step stimulus .",
    "remarkably , as we demonstrated , the case of @xmath0 noise is not much different ; the distribution for neuron voltages just before stimulus also has a long tail extending towards threshold .",
    "these results allude to a possible explanation for why the brain is populated by an astronomically large number of neurons .",
    "it may well be an evolutionary adaptation designed to take advantage of the ambient noise to enhance the probability of survival .",
    "neuron redundancy enables faster response times in the presence of low frequency noise , which in turn allows an animal to react quickly to a sudden danger .",
    "however , the apparently beneficial feature noted above does not come without cost .",
    "the @xmath0 noise trades off speed for reliability by introducing much more variability in the properties of the resulting spike train .",
    "we quantify this uncertainty using the fano factor .",
    "our analysis of the fano factor reveals that in the presence of @xmath0 noise , this measure of disorder increases logarithmically as a function of time . on a positive note",
    ", we find an excellent qualitative agreement between fano factor for the @xmath0 noise and the fano factor derived from laboratory results of experiments with single neurons @xcite .",
    "specifically , the latter also rises monotonically well beyond one and shows no evidence for saturation .",
    "this agreement suggests that the neuron input noise is better approximated by a scale - free @xmath0-like spectrum than the more commonly invoked low frequency lorentzian spectrum .",
    "the rate at which the fano factor for a lorentzian spectrum grows with time prior to saturation is @xmath143 , independent of @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , the lorentzian fano factor always tends to a plateau at long times @xcite .",
    "both tendencies are at odds with the behavior of the experimentally measured fano factor regardless of whether the lorentzian spectrum is fine - tuned to yield a response time similar to that of @xmath0 noise .",
    "we note that these claims can be definitively tested by repeating the experiments of teich _",
    "et al._@xcite with increasingly longer experimental time windows @xmath64 .",
    "the logarithmically rising fano factor reflects the fact that the long time spike dynamics is dominated either by periods of extended inactivity or by periods of aggressive bursting .",
    "this behavior is due to the lack of ergodicity in @xmath0 noise , i.e. , the fact that it lacks a characteristic correlation time . not surprisingly , therefore , the neuron dynamics in the presence of @xmath0 noise is very different from that due to lorentzian noise . as an aside",
    ", we note that the degree of uncertainty is also substantially greater in the leaky model than in the non - leaky ( perfect ) case .",
    "these conclusions are consistent with the observation that some neurons seem to spike in a very irregular fashion .",
    "the temporal gaps of a spike train has much larger information capacity and for this reason , there is considerable body of work arguing that neurons use the timing intervals to encode information .",
    "loss of reliability due to low frequency noise , however , limits the information capacity of the spike trains @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", research has shown that in certain cases neurons can spike with high degree of reproducibility @xcite .",
    "whether the origin of highly reproducible spike patterns is due to extremely low noise at the single neuron level , or due to a network effect that compensates for the noise remains to be seen .",
    "a more interesting possibility is that the various functional regions of the brain may have evolved different strategies for managing ambient noise , depending on function and associated information capacity demands .",
    "we wish to thank the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada for supporting this work .",
    "to simulate the noise used in eq .",
    "( [ currit ] ) we used a variation of the efficient algorithm proposed by timmers and koenig @xcite . consider the time window from @xmath161 to @xmath174 . define a discrete set of @xmath146 time instants @xmath175 , where @xmath176 and @xmath177 . choosing @xmath146 as a power of @xmath178 allows the use of the fast fourier transform algorithm , with significant speed up .",
