    "the _ virtual element method _ ( vem ) , introduced in @xcite , is a recent generalization of the finite element method , which is characterized by the capability of dealing with very general polygonal / polyhedral meshes .",
    "the interest in numerical methods that can make use of general polytopal meshes has recently undergone a significant growth in the mathematical and engineering literature ; among the large number of papers on this subject , we cite as a minimal sample @xcite . indeed",
    ", polytopal meshes can be very useful for a wide range of reasons including meshing of the domain , automatic use of hanging nodes , moving meshes and adaptivity .",
    "vem has been applied successfully in a large range of problems ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "the object of this paper is to introduce and analyze an a posteriori error estimator of residual type for the virtual element approximation of the steklov eigenvalue problem .",
    "in fact , due to the large flexibility of the meshes to which the virtual element method is applied , mesh adaptivity becomes an appealing feature as mesh refinement strategies can be implemented very efficiently .",
    "for instance , hanging nodes can be introduced in the mesh to guarantee the mesh conformity without spreading the refined zones .",
    "in fact hanging nodes introduced by the refinement of a neighboring element are simply treated as new nodes since adjacent non matching element interfaces are perfectly acceptable . on the other hand , polygonal cells with very general shapes",
    "are admissible thus allowing us to adopt simple mesh coarsening algorithms .",
    "the approximation of eigenvalue problems has been the object of great interest from both the practical and theoretical points of view , since they appear in many applications .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references therein for the state of art in this subject area .",
    "in particular , the steklov eigenvalue problem , which involves the laplace operator but is characterized by the presence of the eigenvalue in the boundary condition , appears in many applications ; for example , the study of the vibration modes of a structure in contact with an incompressible fluid ( see @xcite ) and the analysis of the stability of mechanical oscillators immersed in a viscous media ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one of its main applications arises from the dynamics of liquids in moving containers , i.e. , sloshing problems ( see @xcite ) .    on the other hand , adaptive mesh refinement strategies based on a posteriori error indicators",
    "play a relevant role in the numerical solution of partial differential equations in a general sense .",
    "for instance , they guarantee achieving errors below a tolerance with a reasonable computer cost in presence of singular solutions .",
    "several approaches have been considered to construct error estimators based on the residual equations ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . in particular , for the steklov eigenvalue problem we mention @xcite . on the other hand , the design and analysis of a posteriori error bounds for the vem is a challenging task .",
    "references @xcite are the only a posteriori error analyses for vem currently available in the literature . in @xcite ,",
    "a posteriori error bounds for the @xmath0-conforming vem for the two - dimensional poisson problem are proposed . in @xcite ,",
    "a posteriori error bounds are introduced for the @xmath1-conforming vem proposed in @xcite for the discretization of second order linear elliptic reaction - convection - diffusion problems with non constant coefficients in two and three dimensions .",
    "we have recently developed in @xcite a virtual element method for the steklov eigenvalue problem . under standard assumptions on the computational domain",
    ", we have established that the resulting scheme provides a correct approximation of the spectrum and proved optimal order error estimates for the eigenfunctions and a double order for the eigenvalues . in order to exploit the capability of vem in the use of general polygonal meshes and its flexibility for the application of mesh adaptive strategies",
    ", we introduce and analyze an a posteriori error estimator for the virtual element approximation introduced in @xcite .",
    "since normal fluxes of the vem solution are not computable , they will be replaced in the estimators by a proper projection . as a consequence of this replacement",
    ", new additional terms appear in the a posteriori error estimator , which represent the virtual inconsistency of vem .",
    "similar terms also appear in the other papers for a posteriori error estimates of vem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we prove that the error estimator is equivalent to the error and use the corresponding indicator to drive an adaptive scheme .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows : in section  [ sec : apriori ] we present the continuous and discrete formulations of the steklov eigenvalue problem together with the spectral characterization .",
    "then , we recall the a priori error estimates for the virtual element approximation analyzed in @xcite . in section  [ sec : posteriorierror ] , we define the a posteriori error estimator and proved its reliability and efficiency .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : numerejemplo ] , we report a set of numerical tests that allow us to assess the performance of an adaptive strategy driven by the estimator . we have also made a comparison between the proposed estimator and the standard edge - residual error estimator for a finite element method .    throughout the article we will denote by @xmath2 a generic constant independent of the mesh parameter @xmath3 , which may take different values in different occurrences .",

    ", proceeding analogously to the previous case we obtain @xmath242.\\ ] ] thus , the proof is complete .",
    "now , we are in a position to prove an upper bound for the local error indicators @xmath243 .",

    "for those elements @xmath27 with an edge on @xmath138 , the term @xmath249 also appears in the estimate .",
    "let us remark that it is reasonable to expect this terms to be asymptotically negligible .",
    "in fact , this is the case at least for the global estimator @xmath250 as is shown in the following result .",
    "there exists a constant @xmath96 such that @xmath251    from theorem [ eficiencia ] we have that @xmath252 the last term on the right hand side above is bounded as follows : @xmath253 where we have used that @xmath254 .",
    "now , by using a trace inequality and poincar inequality we have @xmath255 on the other hand , using the estimate , we have @xmath256 and we conclude the proof .",
    "in this section , we will investigate the behavior of an adaptive scheme driven by the error indicator in two numerical tests that differ in the shape of the computational domain @xmath18 and , hence , in the regularity of the exact solution . with this aim ,",
    "we have implemented in a matlab code a lowest - order vem ( @xmath42 ) on arbitrary polygonal meshes following the ideas proposed in @xcite .    to complete the choice of the vem , we had to choose the bilinear forms @xmath63 satisfying . in this respect , we proceeded as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.6 ) : for each polygon @xmath27 with vertices @xmath257 , we used @xmath258    in all our tests we have initiated the adaptive process with a coarse triangular mesh . in order to compare the performance of vem with that of a finite element method ( fem ) , we have used two different algorithms to refine the meshes .",
    "the first one is based on a classical fem strategy for which all the subsequent meshes consist of triangles .",
    "in such a case , for @xmath42 , vem reduces to fem .",
    "the other procedure to refine the meshes is described in @xcite .",
    "it consists of splitting each element into @xmath10 quadrilaterals ( @xmath10 being the number of edges of the polygon ) by connecting the barycenter of the element with the midpoint of each edge as shown in figure  [ fig : cero ] ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "notice that although this process is initiated with a mesh of triangles , the successively created meshes will contain other kind of convex polygons , as can be seen in figures  [ fig : uno ] and [ fig : cinco ] .    since we have chosen @xmath42 , according to the definition of the local virtual element space @xmath259 ( cf .",
    ") , the term @xmath260 vanishes .",
    "thus , the error indicators reduce in this case to @xmath261 let us remark that in the case of triangular meshes , the term @xmath262 vanishes too , since @xmath263 and hence @xmath264 is the identity . by the same reason",
    ", the projection @xmath264 also disappears in the definition of @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , for triangular meshes , not only vem reduces to fem , but also the error indicator becomes the classical well - known edge - residual error estimator ( see @xcite ) : @xmath265\\!\\!\\right]_{\\ell},\\quad & \\ell\\in \\ce_{\\o } , \\\\[0.4 cm ] \\l_h w_h-\\dfrac{\\partial w_{h}}{\\partial{n } } , \\quad & \\ell\\in\\ce_{\\g_0 } , \\\\[0.4 cm ] -\\dfrac{\\partial w_{h}}{\\partial{n } } , \\quad & \\ell\\in\\ce_{\\g_1}. \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] in what follows , we report the results of a couple of tests . in both cases , we will restrict our attention to the approximation of the eigenvalues .",
    "let us recall that according to corollary  [ cotalambda ] , the global error estimator @xmath266 provides an upper bound of the error of the computed eigenvalue .",
    "we have chosen for this test a problem with known analytical solution .",
    "it corresponds to the computation of the sloshing modes of a two - dimensional fluid contained in the domain @xmath267 with a horizontal free surface @xmath6 as shown in figure  [ fig : slosh ] .",
    "the solutions of this problem are @xmath268    we have used the two refinement procedures ( vem and fem ) described above .",
    "both schemes are based on the strategy of refining those elements @xmath27 which satisfy @xmath269    figures  [ fig : uno ] and [ fig : dos ] show the adaptively refined meshes obtained with vem and fem procedures , respectively .",
    "+     +    since the eigenfunctions of this problem are smooth , according to we have that @xmath270 .",
    "therefore , in case of uniformly refined meshes , @xmath271 , where @xmath272 denotes the number of degrees of freedom which is the optimal convergence rate that can be attained .",
    "figure  [ fig : tres ] shows the error curves for the computed lowest eigenvalue on uniformly refined meshes and adaptively refined meshes with fem and vem schemes .",
    "the plot also includes a line of slope @xmath273 , which correspond to the optimal convergence rate of the method @xmath274 .",
    "for uniformly refined meshes ( `` uniform fem '' ) , adaptively refined meshes with fem ( `` adaptive fem '' ) and adaptively refined meshes with vem ( `` adaptive vem'').,title=\"fig:\",width=377,height=377 ] [ fig : tres ]    it can be seen from figure  [ fig : tres ] that the three refinement schemes lead to the correct convergence rate .",
    "moreover , the performance of adaptive vem is slightly better than that of adaptive fem , while this is also better than uniform fem .",
    "we report in table [ tabla : n2 ] , the errors @xmath275 and the estimators @xmath266 at each step of the adaptive vem scheme .",

    "we have derived an a posteriori error indicator for the vem solution of the steklov eigenvalue problem .",
    "we have proved that it is efficient and reliable . for lowest order elements on triangular meshes , vem coincides with fem and the a posteriori error indicators also coincide with the classical ones",
    ". however vem allows using general polygonal meshes including hanging nodes , which is particularly interesting when designing an adaptive scheme .",
