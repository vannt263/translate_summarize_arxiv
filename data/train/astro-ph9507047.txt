    "the rich spectrum of lyman - alpha absorption lines in quasars ( generally known as the lyman forest ) was first noted by lynds ( 1971 ) and studied in detail by sargent  ( 1980 ) . because of its ubiquity and spatial correlation properties it is usual to assume that the forest is a distributed intergalactic population rather than being associated with large galaxies . in the first paper of the present series ( cowie 1995 ) we analyzed the metallicity of the lyman forest in clouds with column densities @xmath10 and found that these objects have average metallicities of approximately @xmath11 solar and consist of blends of much narrower components . in the present paper we turn to an analysis of the structure of lower column density forest clouds which",
    ", of necessity , must be based on studies of the lyman absorption lines themselves since we do not currently have the sensitivity to detect metal lines in these objects .",
    "profile fitting to high resolution spectra has been used to study the velocity width ( doppler parameter @xmath5 ) and the neutral hydrogen column densities @xmath12 of the clouds .",
    "the distribution of doppler parameters for the  forest was found to peak near @xmath13 with a rather large spread from 10 to @xmath14 ( carswell  1984 ; atwood  1985 ; carswell  1987 ) .",
    "subsequently , on the basis of the very high resolution echelle observations which had become possible by the end of the 1980 s pettini  ( 1990 ) claimed a tight correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath12 with many clouds having narrow profiles , leading to a median doppler parameter of only @xmath15 .",
    "this result created understandable excitement in theoretical circles since it seemed to question the standard picture of the intergalactic matter confined in warm , extended , highly ionized gas clouds rather than small , cool , almost neutral entities .",
    "however , work by carswell  ( 1991 ) using an identical observational setup did not confirm the pettini  conclusions .",
    "in a recent detailed analysis rauch ( 1993 ) showed that the profile fitting methodology is sensitive to noise and that this can produce the results seen by pettini    the advent of the 10 m telescopes has resulted in an enormous improvement in the s / n which can be achieved in high resolution spectra of the faint quasars and in the present paper we discuss the distribution of low column density forest clouds and the @xmath16 relationship based on such data obtained with the hires spectrograph on the keck telescope .",
    "we find that the @xmath5 distribution is quite invariant as a function of column density and that there is a sharp cutoff in the number of clouds below a value of about @xmath17 , corresponding to temperature @xmath18 k for thermal broadening .",
    "we then argue that the broader absorption lines are blends of components , each with thermal broadening @xmath7 , and each broad line having an average of 3.25 components and a velocity dispersion of @xmath8 .",
    "this structure agrees with that found from the metal lines in the absorption systems just above the present column density range .",
    "as part of a program to measure ( d / h ) ratios in high-@xmath19 absorption systems , a number of bright ( @xmath20 ) @xmath21 quasars with partial lyman - limit edges ( optical depth @xmath22 ) have been observed with the hires spectrograph ( vogt  1994 ) on the keck 10 m telescope .",
    "a more complete description of the data and data reduction procedures is given in songaila ( 1995 ) .",
    "each observation consists of a @xmath23 hr exposure covering the wavelength range @xmath24 at a resolution @xmath25 of 36,000 .",
    "the wavelength coverage is complete at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath26 ) , but has small interorder gaps at longer wavelengths .",
    "four of these spectra ( toward the quasars 0014 + 813 , 0302003 , 0636 + 680 , and 0956 + 122 ) are well suited to a study of the low column - density ( @xmath27 @xmath28 )  forest lines since they have good s / n ( @xmath29 per resolution element ) and fully cover the wavelength range between the quasar  and  lines .",
    "the properties of the quasars are summarized in table 1 .    for each of these four quasars a 600   region of wavelength space",
    "was chosen which lies above the wavelength at which  would enter the spectrum but well below the quasar  emission wavelength to avoid proximity effects .",
    "the wavelength intervals are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the blaze function of the spectrograph in each order was removed by normalizing to fits to white dwarf standard stars obtained in the same configuration before and after each quasar observation .",
    "the continuum level of the spectrum was then established by an iterative fit to each spectral order : all points above a critical value were fitted by a third - order polynomial and renormalized ; the critical value was then raised until the extrema in the noise in the lyman forest region were matched to the extremal noise characteristics in the region above the rest - frame lyman alpha emission taking into account the system response determined from the white dwarf observations and the overall spectral shape of the quasar .",
    "the normalized spectra were then spliced together to form a total spectrum .",
    "each spectrum was fitted with an automatic voigt - profile fitting procedure which added lines at each minimum in the spectrum where the average absorption depth per resolution element , @xmath30 , exceeded 0.05 , until a satisfactory fit was achieved , in which the residuals were consistent with the expected noise levels .",
    "a sample region of a spectrum with the fits and residuals is shown in fig .  1",
    ". there were 1056 lines found with @xmath31 .",
    "the number of detected lines for each quasar is given in table 1 together with the median @xmath5 values in two column density ranges .",
    "the complete line catalogs and spectra are given in the appendix .",
    "for q0014 + 813 we compared the detected clouds in detail with rauch s ( 1992 ) profile fitting analysis of this quasar based on lower resolution ( @xmath32 ) and lower s / n data .",
    "the agreement was generally good and almost always within rauch s error estimates for both @xmath5 and @xmath12 .",
    "almost all of the narrow lines in rauch s sample are found to be caused by scatter , which is consistent with their prediction .",
    "we have limited our primary analysis to the intermediate column density range @xmath33 where uncertainties due to saturation are small . measured column densities at @xmath34",
    "are highly uncertain , but there are 66 clouds in the wavelength range with @xmath35 .    a plot of the @xmath5 values of the fitted lines vs.  column densities is shown in fig .  2 for @xmath36 in the range @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "the lower limit is chosen to avoid the optical depth selection effect against shallow lines , which is illustrated in fig .  2 by the solid line , which corresponds to @xmath39 , and to minimize noise artifacts in the profile fitting .",
    "we have separated q0636 + 680 ( fig .",
    "2@xmath40 ) , which has a relatively large number of narrow lines , from q0014 + 813 , q0302003 , and q0956 + 122 , which have relatively few narrow lines .",
    "in q0636 + 680 17 of the 266 lines in the @xmath41 range have @xmath42 .",
    "a detailed analysis of these narrow lines ( table  2 ) shows that 13 of these can straightforwardly be identified as metal lines based on their correspondance to a strong  line and to other narrow lines in the spectrum .",
    "the remaining narrow lines are quite likely to be unidentified metal lines .",
    "however , the most important point to draw from q0636 + 680 is that narrow lines can easily be retrieved from the spectrum if they are present , and that the absence of large numbers of narrow lines in the three other quasars is not a selection effect .",
    "the ease with which narrow lines can be picked out is also illustrated in fig .  1 .    for q0014 + 813 , q0302003 , and q0956 + 122 ( fig .",
    "2@xmath5 ) there are only 11 out of 670 clouds with @xmath43 which have @xmath42 .",
    "eight of these are straightforwardly identified as metal lines ( table 2 ) .",
    "thus less than 1% of the  forest clouds have @xmath42 .    the @xmath16 distribution of fig .",
    "2@xmath5 has a fairly well defined lower envelope which we have outlined with the dotted line @xmath44 . as we shall show in fig .  3 the slope in this lower extremum is primarily an artifact of the much larger number of clouds at lower  and the increased scatter in the @xmath5 determinations , and the distribution is consistent with a sharp cutoff below @xmath6 which is invariant with column density .",
    "turning to the distribution of column densities we show the raw distribution of counts per unit column density and @xmath19 , @xmath45 , for the four quasars in fig .",
    "the counts are indistinguishable within the poisson uncertainties , indicating that the properties of the forest are highly invariant and that the retrieval of the lines is reproducible from system to system .",
    "in analyzing the data of  2 it is necessary to deal with the problems of blending and selection since confusion becomes significant at the low column density end .",
    "because there are a very large number of weak clouds the probability of cloud blending is high and can result in substantial incompleteness in the low column density counts and widening of the @xmath5 value distribution .",
    "very faint clouds may also be lost if their @xmath5 values are too large and their central optical depths are too low compared to the noise levels .",
    "this latter selection effect , which is relatively unimportant at @xmath46 , is illustrated by the solid line in fig .",
    "2 .    in order to remove these effects",
    "we have performed a number of simulations to measure the cloud incompleteness and @xmath5 distribution widening as a function of column density . in these simulations we assumed that the distribution of column densities was described by a @xmath3 power law normalized to produce the observed number of lines , and that the distribution of @xmath5 values was described by a gaussian with @xmath47 and @xmath48 truncated below @xmath6 .",
    "we also assumed that the @xmath19 distributions were uncorrelated .",
    "these input parameters were chosen to produce output spectra which closely match the observed spectra .",
    "artificial spectra were generated and convolved with the instrumental spectral response with the appropriate gaussian noise added .",
    "the finding program was then run on these artificial spectra to obtain lists of clouds .",
    "the completeness of the cloud recovery in the artificial spectra is tabulated in table 3 . above @xmath49",
    "essentially all clouds are recovered , together with a small number of blends of lower column density clouds , but below this column density the cloud recovery rate drops , falling to a completeness of only 25% in the interval @xmath50 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this effect is not determined by the s / n since the incompleteness is almost wholly dominated by confusion : the recovery rate is essentially the same for an artificial spectrum with infinite s / n .",
    "the number of clouds per unit @xmath19 and unit  in the observed spectra is shown in fig .  3 before and after correcting for the incompleteness .",
    "the corrected distribution in the range @xmath51 is well fit by a power law of the form @xmath52 where @xmath12 is the  column density .",
    "the best fit to the power law index @xmath53 is @xmath54 with a 95% confidence range of @xmath55 .",
    "remarkably , the power law exponent of the spectrum fitted over this limited column density agrees well with the power law fit determined over much larger  ranges ( tytler 1987 , sargent  1989 ) . in fig .",
    "4 we have compared the present data with petitjean s ( 1993 ) summary of recent data at higher column densities and with a power law fit with @xmath56 . for consistency with their notation fig .",
    "4 shows the quantity @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number of clouds in the intervals @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "@xmath62 is roughly a factor of 3.8 less than @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 for the present sample .",
    "we have tabulated @xmath62 in table 3 for the present data .",
    "the two data sets agree extremely well in the overlap region .",
    "the present data set may also be used to check petitjean s finding that there is a significant deficit of clouds in the range @xmath65 compared to the power law extrapolation from higher and lower column densities .",
    "the best power law fit to @xmath62 in the regime @xmath51 , given by @xmath66 with all quantities expressed in cgs units , would predict 193 clouds with @xmath34 compared to the 70 observed , implying that there is indeed a significant deficit between @xmath38 and @xmath67 .",
    "setting @xmath68 only reduces the predicted number of clouds to 127 .",
    "thus there is indeed a significant steepening of the slope above @xmath69 .",
    "the key issues for the @xmath16 distribution is whether the rise of the lower envelope in @xmath5 with @xmath12 is real and whether there are any clouds with very large @xmath5 or whether these are primarily random blends .",
    "we have compared the observed distribution of @xmath5 values in the high ( @xmath70 ) and low ( @xmath71 ) column density regimes in fig .",
    "the models give an acceptable fit to both distributions , showing that a single cutoff at @xmath6 can be adopted at all column densities .",
    "a better fit is given by adopting @xmath72 in the regime @xmath73 and @xmath74 in the @xmath75 range , so a weak increase in the cutoff @xmath5 with @xmath12 may be slightly favored but is not required .",
    "the drop in @xmath5 with decreasing @xmath12 may occur because weaker lines are more susceptible to having their doppler parameters underestimated , due to the finite signal - to - noise of the data .",
    "our first observational conclusion is that the number of  forest clouds rises as a smooth @xmath76 power law in the range @xmath51 and shows no sign of turnover at the low column density end .",
    "confusion makes it essentially impossible to extend this result to much lower column densities .",
    "the second result is that the forest clouds have a well defined lower envelope to the @xmath5 values of @xmath6 .",
    "it is possible for this limit to have a weak dependence on column density rising from @xmath72 at @xmath77 to @xmath74 at @xmath78 , but this is not required by the data .",
    "the distribution of @xmath5 values can be adequately described by a gaussian with @xmath47 and a @xmath48 truncated below @xmath6 at all measured column densities .",
    "the mean intergalactic density , @xmath79 , contributed by the clouds with these column densities may be obtained by integrating equation ( 2 ) whence @xmath80 here @xmath81 is the mean ionization fraction at column density @xmath12 .",
    "assuming that @xmath82 is not such a steep function of @xmath12 that it weights the primary density contribution to the low column density end , we can integrate equation ( 3 ) to obtain @xmath83 where @xmath82 is the appropriately weighted mean value and we have adopted @xmath84 mpc@xmath85 and = 0.5 .",
    "the corresponding mean physical separation is @xmath86    as press & rybicki ( 1993 ) have emphasized , equation ( 4 ) shows at once that the larger @xmath5 values can not be caused by the thermal broadening in the most simple photoionization model where the clouds are in thermal equilibrium and have no kinematic broadening .",
    "thus from donahue & shull ( 1991 )      in terms of their ionization parameter @xmath88 .",
    "however , from equation ( 4 ) we see that @xmath89 must be greater than @xmath90 in order not to exceed the baryon limit from nucleosynthesis of @xmath91 ( walker  1991 ) and hence @xmath92 implying @xmath93 .    the structure of the  lines at slightly higher column densities ( cowie  1995 ) suggests an alternative picture .",
    "if we assume instead that each cloud is a blend of comparable column density components and that the observed @xmath5 value is produced by this blend of components each with a thermally broadened @xmath7 and a centroid velocity spread described by @xmath94 , then the value @xmath7 must be identified with the lower cutoff in @xmath5 which will occur when an absorption line is dominated by a single component .",
    "this model is simplistic in assuming that all components have similar column densities and that there is a single thermal broadening for the clouds when in fact there are likely to be density and ionization parameter variations from component to component .",
    "however , the use of a single value for @xmath5 is justified by the extremely weak dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath88 in equation ( 6 ) .",
    "conversely , the extremely weak dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath88 also implies that @xmath88 and @xmath82 can be determined only to order of magnitude .",
    "thus for @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , while for @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and for @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 . however , and very reassuringly , this agrees with the @xmath88 of @xmath104 estimated by cowie  ( 1995 ) based on the ionization balance in clouds just above @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , the hydrogen thermal broadening would predict a thermal @xmath5 value of @xmath105 for carbon lines , which is very close to the value of @xmath106 found by cowie  finally , with @xmath107 , then @xmath108 and very roughly 4% of the baryons inferred from nucleosynthesis lie in these components .",
    "thus this model appears to provide a self - consistent description .",
    "we can determine the average number of components and their velocity spread by comparing the predicted spread in @xmath5 values with the observed distribution .",
    "if we assume that each absorption line consists of a number of components @xmath79 , each thermally broadened with @xmath17 and described by the probability distribution @xmath109 and that the centroids of these velocity components are described by a gaussian velocity distribution function characterized by @xmath110 , then we can model the observed @xmath5 value distribution function to determine n and @xmath111 .",
    "we find that these quantities are extremely tightly constrained with a best fit of n=3.1 , corresponding to a mean of 3.25 components per absorption line , and @xmath112 .",
    "any smaller value of n results in too many single component clouds with @xmath113 while larger n result in a gaussian spread of @xmath5 values which is also a poor fit to the observed distribution .",
    "the velocity spread is slightly smaller than the value of @xmath114 found by cowie  ( 1995 ) for the spread in  components in @xmath115 clouds and the mean number of  components ( 2.5 ) per absorption line systems is slightly smaller .",
    "this could represent a velocity dependent ionization effect or a difference between the column density samples , but most likely it is due to observational uncertainty and reflects the difficulty of measuring the  dispersion .",
    "the presently determined dispersion should be considerably more accurate .    at larger velocity separations",
    "the components are no longer blended and we may directly investigate the two - point correlation function in the form @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the number of observed pairs at separation @xmath118 and @xmath119 is the number of expected pairs determined from the artificial spectra with no correlation .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "6 . for the forest sample with @xmath120",
    "we find no evidence of correlation at @xmath121 consistent with previous studies ( sargent  1980 ) but for @xmath122 we do find a significant excess of @xmath123  slightly smaller than , but consistent with , the value of @xmath124 found by webb ( 1987 ) . intriguingly ,",
    "if we divide the sample by column density the correlation increases with a value of @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 for @xmath128 suggesting that clouds are preferentially correlated with clouds of similar density , and that there might be a weakening of the correlation as we move to lower column densities . crotts ( 1989 ) , chernomordik ( 1995 ) , and cristiani ( 1995 ) have previously noted such an effect .",
    "cristiani  found a correlation with a value of @xmath129 at @xmath130 for @xmath131 clouds at slightly higher redshift in the spectrum of the quasar q0055269 .",
    "for @xmath132 they obtain @xmath133 .",
    "these values are roughly consistent with the present results , and together they may suggest that the correlation function does weaken at lower column densities .",
    "suggestions of anti - correlation features in the two - point correlation at a few to several hundred km  s@xmath85 may also be noted in fig .",
    "6 . while we can",
    "not be sure of the nature of this phenomenon , such features appear real .",
    "inspection of figures 8 and 9 of cristiani  ( 1995 ) shows that similar negative features are visible in the correlation function of their high column density sample , log  @xmath134 ( see also meiksin & bouchet 1995 ) .",
    "anticorrelation features are expected to occur when some  clouds are forming velocity caustics during turnaround ( kaiser 1987 ; mcgill 1990 ) , but on smaller scales of a few hundred km  s@xmath85 they may be more likely to be due to gas dynamical effects like pressure fluctuations ( webb & barcons 1991 ) or inhomogeneous ionization ( meiksin & bouchet 1995 ) .",
    "finally , we may combine the present data with the properties inferred from the metal lines in the @xmath69  forest to estimate the cloud properties .",
    "cowie  ( 1995 ) found from the ionization balance in the metals that @xmath135 for @xmath69 clouds at this redshift , and , that the neutral hydrogen fraction was then @xmath136 ( from eq .",
    "6(c ) where @xmath137 ) . by the definition of @xmath88 the total density in the cloud",
    "is @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the incident ionizing intensity just above the lyman edge in units of @xmath140 ergs @xmath28 s@xmath85 hz@xmath85 sr@xmath85 . assuming this ionization fraction holds over the relevant column density range , the line - of - sight cloud size , @xmath141 @xmath142 .",
    "this is @xmath143 to @xmath144 of the separation distance for @xmath145 , suggesting that the filling factor of the forest clouds is correspondingly small .",
    "the physical dimensions are similarly small compared to the transverse dimensions ( bechtold  1994 ; dinshaw  1994 ) , suggesting that the clouds are highly flattened .",
    "( rauch & haehnelt 1994 give a more indirect argument to this effect . )",
    "the internal density represents an overdensity of @xmath146 with respect to the average igm , where @xmath147 is the fraction of the closure density in baryons .",
    "the internal kinematic structure strongly favors models in which the underlying formation mechanism is gravitational or kinematic such as the minihalo model of rees ( 1986 ) or the pancake model of cen  ( 1994 ) .",
    "the objects are extremely elongated , which would seem to favor the latter model .",
    "these models allow a natural understanding of the kinematic structure and the spread of velocities , since higher infall or shock velocities would result in too high a temperature for neutral hydrogen to be present . indeed , the pancake model produces a natural explanation for the number of components , since we will see the pancake itself , the outgoing shocks , and possibly the surrounding infalling material . in its current version the pancake model does not correctly predict the extrapolation of the power law distribution of column densities below @xmath148 found in the present paper but this may be very much a function of the assumed details .",
