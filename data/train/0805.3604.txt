    "recently , it has been reported that frustration induces a partially polarized ferrimagnetic ( ppf ) phase  @xcite in addition to a conventional lieb - mattis type ferrimagnetic ( lmf ) phase .",
    "the ppf phase appear when both frustration and quantum fluctuations are fairly strong .",
    "it is an interesting issue how general such a ferrimagnetism is .",
    "hence it is important to investigate the features of ppf phases in various spin systems .",
    "we are then motivated to find a ppf phase in other models and investigate them in detail .",
    "we have introduced a spin chain with side chains in a previous paper  @xcite .",
    "this spin chain has frustration owing to the interaction among spins in the main chain and those of side chains .",
    "the frustration varies in strength and in feature with the variation of parameters in the model .",
    "since we focused on the spin - gap phases in  @xcite , we have investigated the parameter regimes where frustration is not strong enough to destroy the spin - gap phases .",
    "we then found two spin - gap phases and explained them by singlet cluster solid ( scs ) pictures .    in the present work ,",
    "we examine this model in a highly frustrated regime .",
    "this regime , in which the frustration plays a central role , is of interest in its own right , since the model exhibits features very different from those in the weak frustration regimes .",
    "we actually find clear numerical evidences not only for the above mentioned fascinating ppf phase but also for the spin quadrupolar ( qp ) phase  @xcite .",
    "these phases are totally different from the conventional phases such as spin gap phases and the lmf phase which can be realized even in the unfrustrated case",
    ". they will be investigated in detail in the present paper .",
    "also numerical data are obtained which suggest the possible existence of an exotic almost critical nonmagnetic ground state in the regime where the couplings between the side chain and main chain spins are weak but strongly frustrated .    the transition from a ferrimagnetic phase to",
    "a nonmagnetic phase in the present model takes place because the quantum fluctuation in the side - chains destroys the ferrimagnetic long range order in the main chain .",
    "the mechanism of quantum destruction of ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism has been less studied than that of antiferromagnetism ; the latter has been extensively studied in relation with the high-@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "recently , however , experiments have been reported on the nonmagnetic ground states in one- and two - dimensional materials  @xcite with ferromagnetic nearest neighbour and antiferromagnetic next nearest neighbour couplings .",

    "the spontaneous magnetization in this phase is a simple fraction of the saturated magnetization .",
    "in contrast , the spontaneous magnetization in the ppf phase continuously varies with the parameter characterizing the strength of frustration and is not a simple fraction of the saturated magnetization .",
    "the ppf phase appears between the lmf phase and the nonmagnetic spin gap phases .",
    "this type of phase is first predicted in the pioneering work of sachev and senthil  @xcite in the quantum rotor model .",
    "bartosch , kollar and kopietz  @xcite proposed a possibility of ferromagnetic luttinger liquid in an itinerant one - dimensional fermi system .",
    "the first explicit example of quantum ppf phase induced by frustration in one - dimensional quantum spin systems was proposed by ivanov and richter  @xcite in a frustrated mixed spin ladder .",
    "similar phases are also found by yoshikawa and miyashita  @xcite in a uniform spin chain and by one of the present authors in a trimerized zigzag chain  @xcite .",
    "we propose another example of the ppf phase in the present mixed spin chain .",
    "the present example is substantially different from previous ones , because it is accompanied by the destruction of the ferrimagnetic order in the main chain by the frustrated coupling to the quantum fluctuation in the side chains .",
    "the qp phase is well known for the spin-1 bilinear - biquadratic chain between the haldane and ferromagnetic phases  @xcite .",
    "the exact bethe ansatz solution is available if the coefficients of the bilinear and the biquadratic terms coincide with each other  @xcite .",
    "recently , similar phases are found in the frustrated two - dimensional heisenberg model with ferromagnetic nearest neighbour interaction and antiferromagnetic next nearest neighbour interaction  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explicitly show that our model reduces to the bilinear - biquadratic chain in appropriate limiting cases .",

    "the local magnetization profile has an incommensurate structure in the ppf phase .",
    "these features are common with other examples of ppf phases induced by frustration .",
    "classical interpretation of the ppf phase is also presented .",
    "it is pointed out that an infinitesimal magnetic field selects the ppf state in an appropriate parameter region . for the quantum model , however , the ppf state is realized in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "this suggests that quantum fluctuation selects one of the classical ground states .",
    "the presence of qp phase is demonstrated by the perturbational calculation as well as the numerical method . although the present perturbational calculation is carried out for our specific model ( [ ham2 ] ) , the derivation of the effective spin-1 bilinear - biquadratic chain is quite general and is applicable to models which have an effective spin-1 degree of freedom in each unit cell .",
    "the qp phase appears around the point where the first order effective coupling vanishes due to frustration .",
    "hence the qp phase is expected to be commonly found in a wide variety of frustrated quantum spin chains .    for @xmath18 and @xmath131 and @xmath164 , the main chain couples only weakly with side spins but the frustration is strong .",
    "in this case , there appears an almost critical nonmagnetic ground state in which the spin inversion parity under the twisted boundary condition changes many times with the variation of parameters . considering the continuity to the similar ground state in the effective model for large @xmath19 ,",
    "it is likely that a series of gaussian transitions take place among gapped phases with an extremely small gap .",
    "although the nature of this almost critical ground state remains unresolved , we may speculate its physical origin in the following way : in the absence of side spins @xmath2 , the ground state of the main chain is ferrimagnetically ordered . for small @xmath58 , side spins",
    "are coupled to this ferrimagnetic moment antiferromagnetically via @xmath165 bond and ferromagnetically via @xmath166 bonds . for @xmath167",
    ", the effective coupling is even weakened due to frustration , and for @xmath168 , the ferrimagnetic state of the main chain has no local valence bond structure .",
    "therefore the effective coupling among the side spins , which is mediated by the fluctuation in the main chain , would be very long ranged for @xmath131 .",
    "this implies that the resultant nonmagnetic state should have a highly nonlocal character .",
    "thus we may speculate that the ground state has an extremely small energy gap and large scale singlet clusters .",
    "a similar ground state with extremely small gap is known in a @xmath61 zigzag chain with ferromagnetic nearest neighbor interaction and antiferromagnetic next nearest neighbor interaction  @xcite .",
    "however we do not find an explicit mapping of the present model onto the field theory of ref .",
    "the numerical diagonalization program is based on the package titpack ver.2 coded by h. nishimori .",
    "the numerical computation in this work has been carried out using the facilities of the supercomputer center , institute for solid state physics , university of tokyo and supercomputing division , information technology center , university of tokyo .",
    "this work is partly supported by a grant - in - aid for scientific research on priority areas , `` novel states of matter induced by frustration '' , from the ministry of education , science , sports and culture of japan , and fund for project research in toyota technological institute .",
