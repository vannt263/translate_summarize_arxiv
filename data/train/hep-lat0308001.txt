    "the study of hadronic electromagnetic properties provides important insight into the non - perturbative structure of qcd . a model - independent tool to study qcd at low energies is chiral perturbation theory ( ) , which is an effective field theory with low - energy degrees of freedom , e.g. , the meson octet in @xmath1 flavor .",
    "assumes that these mesons are the pseudo - goldstone bosons that appear from spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry from @xmath2 down to @xmath3 .",
    "observables receive contributions from both long - range and short range physics ; in  the long - range contribution arises from the ( non - analytic ) pion loops , while the short - range contribution arises from low - energy constants .",
    "the number of these low - energy constants is constrained by symmetries but their values must be determined from experiment or lattice simulations .",
    "progress in measuring the proton and neutron form factors has been made ( see @xcite for references ) , including recent high precision measurements for the proton  @xcite .",
    "experimental study of the remaining baryons , in particular the decuplet baryon resonances , however , is much harder .",
    "experiments measuring the decuplet magnetic moments are anticipated in the foreseeable future .",
    "the particle data group lists values for the @xmath4 magnetic moment  @xcite but with sizeable discrepancy and uncertainty , even among the two most recent results  @xcite .",
    "a report of the initial measurement of the @xmath5 magnetic moment  @xcite has recently appeared , and further data are eagerly awaited .",
    "although more experimental data for the other decuplet electromagnetic moments can be expected in the future , progress will be slow due to significant experimental difficulties .",
    "theory , however , may be able to catch up . while lattice calculations using the quenched approximation have already appeared  @xcite , we expect partially quenched calculations for decuplet observables in the near future .",
    "one problem that currently and foreseeably plagues these lattice calculations is that they are performed with unphysically large quark masses .",
    "therefore , to make physical predictions , one must extrapolate from the heavier quark masses used on the lattice ( currently on the order of the strange quark mass ) down to the physical light quark masses .",
    "for quenched qcd ( qqcd ) lattice calculations , where the fermion determinant that arises from the path integral is set equal to one , one uses quenched chiral perturbation theory ( )  @xcite to extrapolate .",
    "the problem with the quenched approximation is that the goldstone boson singlet , the @xmath6 , which is heavy in qcd , remains light and must be included in the  lagrangian .",
    "this requires new operators and hence new low - energy constants .",
    "thus in general , the low - energy constants appearing in are unrelated to those in  and extrapolated quenched lattice data is unrelated to qcd .",
    "in fact , several examples show that the behavior of meson loops near the chiral limit is frequently misrepresented in  @xcite .",
    "we find this to be true for the decuplet electromagnetic observables . indeed , to the order we work only quenched chiral singularities are present in the quenched electromagnetic moments ; the charge radii have no quark mass dependence at all .",
    "the unattractive features of qqcd can be remedied by using partially quenched lattice qcd ( pqqcd ) . unlike in qqcd , where the `` sea quarks '' are neglected by setting the fermion determinant to unity , in pqqcd these sea quarks are kept as dynamical degrees of freedom and their masses",
    "can be varied independently of the valence quark masses . for computational reasons",
    "they are usually chosen to be heavier .",
    "the low - energy effective theory of pqqcd is  @xcite .",
    "since pqqcd retains a @xmath7 anomaly , the equivalent to the singlet field in qcd is heavy ( on the order of the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath8 ) and can be integrated out  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the low - energy constants appearing in  are the same as those appearing in . by fitting  to partially quenched lattice data",
    "one can determine these constants and actually make physical predictions for qcd",
    ".  has been used recently to study heavy meson  @xcite and octet baryon observables  @xcite .",
    "while there has been a quenched lattice calculation of the decuplet magnetic moments  @xcite , there are currently no partially quenched simulations .",
    "however , in light of the progress that lattice gauge theory has made recently in the one - hadron sector and the prospect of simulations in the two - hadron sector  @xcite , we expect to see partially quenched calculations of the decuplet electromagnetic form factors in the near future .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : pqcpt ] , we review  including the treatment of the baryon octet and decuplet in the heavy baryon approximation . in section  [ sec : ff ] , we calculate the electromagnetic moments and charge radii of the decuplet baryons in both  and up to next - to - leading ( nlo ) order in the chiral expansion .",
    "we use the heavy baryon formalism of jenkins and manohar  @xcite , and work to lowest order in the heavy baryon expansion .",
    "these calculations are done in the isospin limit of @xmath1 flavor .",
    "expressions for form factors with the @xmath9 dependence at one loop are given in appendix [ s : q - dep ] .",
    "for completeness we also provide the   result for the baryon quartet electromagnetic moments and charge radii for the @xmath0 chiral lagrangian with non - degenerate quarks in appendix [ s : su2 ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in pqqcd the quark part of the lagrangian is written as  @xcite @xmath10 here , in addition to the fermionic light valence quarks @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , their bosonic counterparts @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ( the ghost quarks ) and three light fermionic sea quarks @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 have been added .",
    "these nine quarks are in the fundamental representation of the graded group @xmath20  @xcite and appear in the vector @xmath21 that obeys the graded equal - time commutation relation @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are spin and @xmath25 and @xmath17 are flavor indices .",

    "the quark mass matrix is given by @xmath29 so that diagrams with closed ghost quark loops cancel those with valence quarks .",

    "the light quark electric charge matrix @xmath33 is not uniquely defined in pqqcd  @xcite .",
    "the only constraint one imposes is for the charge matrix @xmath33 to have vanishing supertrace , so that no new operators involving the singlet component are subsequently introduced .",
    "following the convention in  @xcite , we use @xmath34 when @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , qcd is recovered independently of the @xmath38 s .      for massless quarks , the lagrangian in eq .",

    "the lagrangian in one finds that to lowest order the mesons with quark content @xmath54 are canonically normalized when their masses are given by @xmath55    the flavor singlet field given by @xmath56 is , in contrast to the  case , rendered heavy by the @xmath7 anomaly and can therefore be integrated out in .",
    "analogously its mass @xmath57 can be taken to be on the order of the chiral symmetry breaking scale , @xmath58 . in this limit",
    "the flavor singlet propagator becomes independent of the coupling @xmath23 and deviates from a simple pole form  @xcite .      just as there are mesons in pqqcd with quark content @xmath59 that contain valence , sea , and ghost quarks , there are baryons with quark composition @xmath60 that contain all three types of quarks",
