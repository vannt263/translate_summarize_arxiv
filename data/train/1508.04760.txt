    "the planck 2015 measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies in both temperature and polarization @xcite provide detailed probes of cosmological inflationary models .",
    "in particular , the planck 2015 data provide a very precise measurement of the scalar spectral index @xmath2 . also the recent @xmath3-mode polarization results from the joint analysis of bicep2/keck array and planck data @xcite support the models which predict relatively low values for the scalar - to - tensor perturbation ratio @xmath4 .",
    "historically , the first model of inflation was proposed by starobinsky in 1980 @xcite and it was based on the addition of the @xmath0 term in the einstein - hilbert action with the motivation to include semi - classical quantum effects .",
    "the aim of that model was to some extent different from the inflationary cosmology and instead of attempting to solve the homogeneity and isotropy problems , starobinsky assumed the model of the universe which was homogeneous and isotropic from the initial times . in 1981 , guth @xcite proposed that by regarding an inflationary era before the radiation dominated era , one can solve the flatness problem , the horizon problem and the magnetic monopole problem .",
    "this model is known as the `` old inflation '' model and is based on a scalar field which goes from a false vacuum toward a true vacuum through a first order phase transition in the form of a quantum tunnelling @xcite . in old inflation ,",
    "duo to this phase transition , bubbles of true vacuum form in the sea of the false vacuum @xcite .",
    "if the generated bubbles collide to each other then a region of false vacuum is trapped inside the region of the true vacuum and a disequilibrium state takes place .",
    "subsequently , to recover an equilibrium state , the trapped false vacuum region releases its energy in the form of radiation and we can get the radiation dominated era after inflation .",
    "but it was realized that if the probability of the bubble nucleation is small such as in the situation that the scalar field traps in the false vacuum , then the bubbles are formed far away from each other and hence they can not collide to each other so that they remain cold forever and we can not recover the radiation dominated era after inflation @xcite . on the other hand , if the probability of the bubble nucleation is large then the bubbles are generated close to each other and they can collide to each other such that the universe becomes extremely inhomogeneous @xcite . to overcome these problems , in 1982 ,",
    "the `` new inflation '' model was suggested by linde @xcite and by albrecht and steinhardt @xcite . in this new model of inflation , a scalar field rolls slowly from top of an approximately flat effective potential toward the minimum of the potential and the bubbles are nucleated duo to a phase transition in grand unified theories ( guts ) with the coleman - weinberg mechanism of symmetry breaking @xcite . in new inflation , in order to have slow - rolling for the scalar field , the effective potential should have a flat plateau in its shape that is rather unnatural @xcite .",
    "also , in this scenario , the scalar field can not be in thermal equilibrium with the other fields and consequently the theory of cosmological phase transition can not be applicable to this model @xcite . because of these difficulties , the `` chaotic inflation '' was presented in 1983 by linde @xcite . in this scenario , inflation is a natural ( and may be even inevitable ) consequence of chaotic initial conditions in the early universe @xcite . in the chaotic inflation ,",
    "a classical description of the evolution of the universe becomes possible only after the planck time @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the reduced planck mass ) , when the energy density becomes smaller than @xmath7 and before that time the universe is usually assumed to be in some chaotic quantum state @xcite . in this model ,",
    "slow - rolling is duo to the largeness of the friction term in the evolution equation of the scalar field and hence the shape of the potential does not need to have a flat plateau @xcite . furthermore , the scalar field does not need to be a state of thermal equilibrium during its evolution @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the universe in the chaotic inflation has no end and may have no beginning . motivating from this , linde @xcite proposed the idea of `` eternal inflation '' implying that the large - scale quantum fluctuations of the scalar field generated in the chaotic inflation scenario lead to infinite process of self - reproduction of inflationary mini - universes so that we may have multiverse instead of only one universe .",
    "along with the extension of the inflationary models , the theory of cosmological perturbations was developed too @xcite .",
    "for the first time , mukhanov and chibisov @xcite calculated the spectrum of the perturbations in the range of observable scales in the context of the starobinsky @xmath0 inflation .",
    "the quantum fluctuation of the scalar field during inflation lead to generation of the perturbations that growth of them can be regarded as the origin of the large - scale structure ( lss ) formation and the anisotropy observed in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite .",
    "thus , from the observations corresponding to the lss formation and cmb anisotropy , we can obtain useful information about the inflationary era .",
    "important observational results about inflation are reported by planck collaboration @xcite , which are obtained from measurements of the cmb anisotropies in both temperature and polarization . using these observational results",
    ", one can discriminate between different inflationary models .",
    "as we saw so far , the conventional models of inflation are based on the scalar fields .",
    "the scalar field responsible for inflation is called `` inflaton '' which is used to describe the energy of the vacuum quantum fields during inflation .",
    "it is usually assumed that during inflation , the energy of the inflaton field dominates over the contribution of other fields .",
    "since the energy density of the inflaton field is approximately constant , it gives rise to a negative pressure required to have an accelerating expansion .",
    "two important scalar fields are quintessence and tachyon which have motivations from the quantum field theory and the string theory .",
    "the energy density of the quintessence scalar field includes a canonical kinetic term plus a potential term @xcite .",
    "however , motivating from the string theory , the non - canonical scalar fields are proposed that their kinetic term in the action is different from the standard canonical kinetic term @xcite",
    ". one important class of the non - canonical models are the @xmath8-inflation models in which the higher - order scalar kinetic terms in the action can , without the help of the potential , drive an inflationary evolution @xcite .",
    "the tachyon scalar field can be regarded as a non - canonical scalar field that does not support inflation in the limit in which the higher - dimensional kinetic operators are important @xcite .    in standard cold inflationary models",
    ", it is assumed that the inflaton field is not in equilibrium with the other fields during inflation . in these models , in order to reach the radiation dominated era after inflation , we need to an additional mechanism called reheating process which its details are unknown to us so far . to overcome this problem ,",
    "some inflationary models were proposed in which during inflation , the energy of the inflaton field transforms continuously to the energy of the radiation field .",
    "so one can recover the radiation dominated era after inflation without need to any reheating process .",
    "these models are known as the warm inflationary models that have been extensively investigated in the literature @xcite .",
    "dynamics of the scalar field during inflation is determined by a potential that we do not know its shape so far . in order to understand the inflationary potential , we need to more advances in both theory and observation . however , by examination of different potentials in light of the observational results , we can specify some features of the original inflationary potential . in this paper ,",
    "our main aim is to examine various inflationary potentials in cold and warm quintessential / tachyonic inflationary scenarios in light of the planck 2015 results . in this way",
    ", we discriminate between viable inflationary potentials in each scenario .",

    "<S> within the framework of cold and warm quintessential / tachyonic inflationary scenarios , we consider different inflationary potentials and check their viability in light of the planck 2015 results . in the cold quintessential inflation , the exponential and inverse power - law potentials that give rise to the power - law and intermediate inflations , respectively , are not favored according to the planck 2015 results . </S>",
    "<S> but , the power - law potential can be in agreement with the planck 2015 data at 95% cl . </S>",
    "<S> also , the predictions of the higgs - like and coleman - weinberg potentials and @xmath0 inflation can lie inside the 68% cl region of planck 2015 data . in the warm quintessential inflationary scenario , the power - law potential with a constant dissipative parameter @xmath1 , the inverse power - law and exponential potentials with constant / varying @xmath1 do not lead to acceptable results . </S>",
    "<S> but the power - law potential with varying @xmath1 , the higgs - like and coleman - weinberg potentials and @xmath0 inflation with constant @xmath1 can be consistent with the planck 2015 data at 68% cl . in the cold tachyonic inflationary model </S>",
    "<S> , the results of the inverse power - law and exponential potentials can be placed within the region 95% cl of planck 2015 data . within the framework of warm tachyonic inflation , </S>",
    "<S> the inverse power - law and exponential potentials with constant @xmath1 can not provide favored results . </S>",
    "<S> but for some special varying @xmath1 , the results of both potentials can be compatible with the planck 2015 data . </S>"
