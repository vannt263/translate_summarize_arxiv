    "most of the heavy elements ( here , z @xmath5 30 ) in the solar system are formed in neutron - capture ( _ n_-capture ) processes , either the slow ( _ s_- ) or rapid ( _ r_- ) process .",

    "( 1957 ) . in the @xmath6-process",
    "the relative lifetime for neutron captures ( @xmath7 ) is much longer than for electron ( @xmath8 ) decays ( @xmath9 ) . as a result , the @xmath3-capture path in the @xmath6-process is near the so - called valley of beta stability , and the properties of nuclei involved in this nucleosynthesis are , in great part , experimentally accessible .",
    "the situation is quite different in the @xmath0-process where @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-process path occurs in a very neutron - rich regime far from stability , making experimental measurements of those nuclei very difficult , if not impossible .",
    "in this review we focus on advances in our understanding  still very incomplete  of the @xmath0-process .",
    "we note there have been a number of earlier reviews , including those by hillebrandt ( 1978 ) , mathews & cowan ( 1990 ) , cowan , thielemann , & truran ( 1991a ) , meyer ( 1994 ) , truran et al .",

    "we employ and emphasize the observed stellar @xmath3-capture abundances in our discussion of the @xmath0-process .",
    "these abundances , particularly in low - metal ( i.e. , low iron , [ fe / h ] , abundance ) stars , provide direct clues to the natures of the @xmath0-process and @xmath6-process formation sites .",
    "in addition , the abundances of the @xmath3-capture elements and related chemical evolution studies have also provided important information concerning the @xmath0-process , specifically in relation to early galactic nucleosynthesis and star formation history ( see reviews of galactic chemical evolution by , e.g. , wheeler , sneden , & truran 1989 , mcwilliam 1997 , and truran et al .",
    "we also note , and discuss briefly , the importance of certain long - lived radioactive elements , such as thorium and uranium , produced entirely in the _ r_-process .",
    "the abundance levels of these nuclear chronometers in the most metal - poor halo stars can provide direct age determinations , and hence set lower limits on galactic and cosmological age estimates ( see , e.g. , cowan , thielemann , & truran 1991b ) .      in this section",
    "we examine the abundances of the elements , concentrating on those produced in neutron - capture processes .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig1.ps ] the solar system abundances based upon the compilation of grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) .",
    "earlier compilations include those of anders & ebihara ( 1982 ) , cameron ( 1982a ) , and anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "we also note the very recent solar system abundance determinations of lodders ( 2003 ) .",
    "these solar system abundances can in many ways be treated as `` cosmic '' and are frequently employed for stellar abundance comparisons .",
    "we highlight in figure  [ fig1.ps ] the abundances of the neutron - capture elements in solar system material .",
    "as is well known , these elements above iron are synthesized predominantly by , and are the sum of individual isotopic contributions from , the _ s_- and the _ r_-process .",
    "the deconvolution of the solar system material into the @xmath6-process and @xmath0-process has traditionally relied upon reproducing the `` @xmath11 n '' curve ( i.e. , the product of the @xmath3-capture cross section and @xmath6-process abundance ) .",
    "this `` classical approach '' to the @xmath6-process is empirical and , by definition , model independent . subtracting these @xmath6-process isotopic contributions from the solar abundances",

    "more sophisticated models , based upon @xmath6-process nucleosynthesis in low - mass agb stars , have been developed recently ( arlandini et al . 1999 ) . comparing the solar system elemental @xmath0-process abundance predictions obtained from these model calculations ( arlandini et al .",

    "1996 , 2000a , 2003 ) , hd  115444 ( westin et al . 2000 ) , 17 ( cowan et al . 2002 ) , and cs  31082@xmath4001 ( hill et al .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig4.ps ] relative abundance distributions in those four stars , again compared with a scaled solar system @xmath0-process distribution ( solid lines ) .",
    "particularly noteworthy has been : ( 1 ) the increasing accessibility of elements in the third @xmath0-process peak , typically only available with observations in the uv with the _ hubble space telescope _ ; and ( 2 ) the increasingly precise abundance determinations , resulting in great part from marked improvements in the atomic physics data ( see , e.g. , lawler , bonvallet , & sneden 2001 ; den hartog et al .",
    "2003 , and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , advancements in the atomic physics input have eliminated more and more discrepancies between observed metal - poor stellar abundances and solar @xmath0-process abundance predictions .",
    "further improvements in individual elemental abundance determinations might be employed to constrain the various theoretical predictions of the actual solar system @xmath0-process abundances .",
    "figure  [ fig4.ps ] makes clear that for all four of these @xmath0-process - rich stars , the elemental abundances , from ba through the third @xmath0-process peak , are consistent with relative solar @xmath0-process proportions .",
    "this suggests that for elements with z @xmath2 56 the @xmath0-process is very robust , appearing to operate in a relatively consistent manner over the history of the galaxy .",
    "this might imply a similar range of conditions ( both astrophysical and nuclear ) for the operation of the @xmath0-process ( freiburghaus et al .",
    "1999a ) , and perhaps even a narrow range of masses for supernovae sites of the @xmath0-process ( e.g. , mathews , bazan , & cowan 1992 ; wheeler , cowan , & hillenbrandt 1998 ; ishimaru & wanajo 1999 ) .",
    "while there have been a continuing number of observations of elements in the metal - poor stars , isotopic abundance studies have been relatively rare .",
    "this has been predominantly due to observational difficulties ",
    "isotopic wavelength shifts for transitions of most all @xmath3-capture elements are small compared to the thermal and turbulent line widths in stellar spectra .",
    "recently , sneden et al . ( 2002 ) and aoki et al . (",
    "2003 ) have determined europium isotopic abundance fractions in four very metal - poor , @xmath0-process - rich stars : cs  22892@xmath4052 , hd  115444 , 17 , and cs  31082@xmath4001 .",
    "the abundance fractions for eu in these stars are in excellent agreement with each other and with their values in the solar system : fr(@xmath13eu )  @xmath14 fr(@xmath15eu )  @xmath14 0.5 .",
    "additional eu stellar abundance studies that demonstrate this same solar system @xmath0-process agreement have been reported ( ivans 2003 , private communication ) .",
    "these isotopic abundance observations support earlier studies that indicate that stellar elemental abundances for z  @xmath16  56 match very closely those of a scaled solar system @xmath0-process abundance distribution . with only two isotopes ,",
    "perhaps it is not totally surprising that the eu abundance fractions in the metal - poor halo stars are the same as in the solar system .",
    "it does suggest , though , that the solar abundances are cosmic , in some sense , and that the @xmath0-process ( for the heavier @xmath3-capture elements ) is robust over the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , a more definitive test would be an isotopic analysis of the element ba with many more isotopes than eu .",
    "lambert & allende - prieto ( 2002 ) have done such an analysis in another metal - poor star , hd 140283 , and find that the isotopic fractions of ba are also consistent with the solar @xmath0-process values .",
    "additional stellar isotopic abundance studies will be necessary to strengthen and extend these findings .",
    "although the @xmath0-process has been studied for many years , the actual site for this nucleosynthesis has not been identified . further complicating this search is the possibility of more than one such site .",
    "nevertheless , there has been much progress in our understanding of the astrophysical models and the related nuclear physics of the @xmath0-process .",
    "the nature of the @xmath0-process requires high neutron number densities on short time scales , indicative of explosive environments . the early work of burbidge et al .",
    "( 1957 ) suggested that the neutron - rich ejecta outside of the core in a collapsing ( type ii , ib ) supernova was the likely site for the @xmath0-process .",
    "nevertheless , the detailed physics of core - collapse supernovae were poorly known at that time , to say nothing of the lack of computational tools .",
    "these hindrances prevented definitive identifications on the nature of the @xmath0-process and led to the consideration of other possible sites , including the shocked helium and carbon zones of exploding supernovae and jets and bubbles of neutron - rich material ejected from the collapsing core ( see cowan et al .",
    "1991a , and references therein ) .",
    "inhomogeneous big bang cosmological models were even studied as possible sites ( rauscher et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "advances in understanding supernova physics , particularly neutrino interactions , led to new promising @xmath0-process scenarios , such as the high - entropy neutrino wind in supernovae ( takahashi , witti , & janka 1994 ; woosley et al . 1994 ; qian & woosley 1996 ; wanajo et al . 2001 , 2002 ; terasawa et al .",
    "there have been some problems , however , with these models in obtaining the required entropies and in some inadequate abundance predictions ( see , e.g. , meyer , mclaughlin , & fuller 1998 ; freiburghaus , rosswog , & thielemann 1999b ; thompson , burrows , & myer 2001 ; but see also thompson 2003 ) .",

    "1998 ; sumiyoshi et al .",
    "2001 ; wanajo et al .",
    "it has also been argued that not all core - collapse supernovae are responsible for @xmath0-process synthesis .",
    "in particular there have been a number of studies that suggest only low - mass ( @xmath1 ) 11 supernovae are likely sites ( mathews & cowan 1990 ; mathews et al . 1992 ; wheeler et al .",
    "1998 ; ishimaru & wanajo 1999 ; wanajo et al .",
    "2003 ; but see also wasserburg & qian 2000 or cameron 2001 ) .",
    "while most of the attention in studying the @xmath0-process has focused on supernovae , there has been some consideration of neutron star binaries , which have an abundance of neutron - rich material .",
    "early studies suggested that the tidal interaction between a neutron star and a black hole , or a second neutron star , might be a possible astrophysical site for this nucleosynthesis ( see , e.g. , lattimer et al .",
    "despite encouraging recent studies by rosswog et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and freiburghaus et al .",
    "( 1999a ) , however , there are questions about whether the frequency of these events and the amount of @xmath0-process ejecta per merger are consistent with observational constraints ( qian 2000 ) .    accompanying the advances in these more sophisticated astrophysical models",
    "has been a concomitant improvement in our understanding of the nuclear physics involved in the @xmath0-process - particularly more reliable nuclear information about the very neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the @xmath0-process occurs far from stability , and , thus , in the past there has been little reliable nuclear data available .",
    "recently , however , there have been an increasing amount of experimental determinations of critical nuclear data , including half - lives and neutron - pairing energies ( see , e.g. , pfeiffer , kratz , & mller 2002 ; mller , pfeiffer , & kratz 2003 ) .",
    "in addition to these new nuclear data , there have been recent advances in theoretical prescriptions for very neutron - rich nuclear data ( see , e.g. , chen et al .",
    "1995 ; pearson , nayak , & goriely 1996 ; mller , nix , & kratz 1997 ) .",
    "in particular , these developments include nuclear mass formulae that are more reliable and physically predictive for nuclei far from stability  especially crucial for chronometer studies  for example , such mass models as etfsi - q and hfbcs-1 ( see schatz et al .",
    "2002 for discussion and additional references therein ) .",
    "the combination of more nuclear data and advances in theoretical mass models has led to increasingly more reliable descriptions for very neutron - rich nuclei , necessary for a better understanding of the @xmath0-process ( see also pfeiffer et al .",
    "2001 for further discussion )      the observations ( discussed above ) demonstrate that the heavier ( ba and above , z @xmath2 56 , or a @xmath17 130140 ) neutron - capture elements , particularly in @xmath0-process - rich stars , are consistent with a scaled solar system @xmath0-process curve . until very recently , however , there has been relatively little data for elements between zr and ba .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig5.ps ] the total abundance summary of the elements in 22 . a total of 58 elements ( 53 detections and 5 upper limits ) have been observed in this star , which appears to be the most of any other star except the sun at the time ( sneden et al .",
    "the dashed line in the figure indicates the iron abundance ( [ fe / h ] = 3.1 ) in this star .",
    "it is clear from the abundances of the heavy @xmath3-capture elements why this star has been so well studied[eu / fe ] , for example , is enhanced by approximately a factor of 45 above the iron abundance level .",
    "it is also seen in this figure that the abundances of the light @xmath3-capture elements in the little - explored element regime of z = 4050 mostly lie below those of the heavy @xmath3-capture elements .",
    "this difference is seen in more detail in figure  [ fig6.ps ] , where the abundances in 22 ( sneden et al .",

    "the dotted line in each panel indicates the unweighted mean difference for elements in the range 56  @xmath18  z  @xmath18  79 .",
    "it is clear that the stellar abundance data are well fit by both of these distributions for z@xmath2 56 , confirming earlier such results ( as discussed above and shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3.ps ] and [ fig4.ps ] ) .",
    "the data , however , seem to indicate that some of the lighter @xmath3-capture elements from z = 4050 ( for example ag and mo ) are not consistent with ( i.e. , in general fall below ) those same scaled @xmath0-process curves that fit the heavy @xmath3-capture elements .",
    "there are exceptions , with the abundances of nb and rh seemingly consistent with the scaled solar system @xmath0-process curve , but on average these lighter elements do seem to have been synthesized at a lower abundance level than the heavier @xmath3-capture elements .",
    "there are several possible explanations for the differences in the abundance data for the lighter and heavier _ n_-capture elements .",
    "these observations might support earlier suggestions of two @xmath0-processes based upon solar system meteoritic ( isotopic ) data ( wasserburg , busso & gallino 1996 ) .",
    "it has been suggested , for example , that perhaps , analogously to the @xmath6-process , the lighter elements might be synthesized in a `` weak '' _ r_-process with the heavier elements synthesized in a more robust `` strong '' ( or `` main '' ) _",
    "r_-process ( truran et al . 2002 ) .",
    "thus , the helium zones of exploding supernovae , have been suggested as possible second _ r_-process sites that might be responsible for the synthesis of nuclei with a @xmath19 130140 ( truran & cowan 2000 ) . or the two sites might come from supernovae of a different mass range or frequency ( wasserburg & qian 2000 ) , or perhaps a combination of supernova and neutron star binaries ( truran et al . 2002 ) .",
    "alternative interpretations have suggested that the entire abundance distribution could be synthesized in a single core - collapse supernova ( sneden et al .",
    "2000a ; cameron 2001 ) .",
    "we note , however , that only a few ( three ) stars have detailed abundance distributions that include data in this z = 4050 element domain .",

    "the presence of these @xmath0-process elements in the very oldest stars in our galaxy strongly suggests the astrophysical @xmath0-process site is short - lived .",
    "thus , the first stars , the progenitors of the halo stars , were likely massive and evolved quickly , synthesized the @xmath0-process elements and ejected them into the interstellar medium before the formation of the currently observed stars .",
    "in contrast , the primary site for @xmath6-process nucleosynthesis is low- or intermediate - mass stars ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) with long evolutionary time scales ( busso , gallino , & wasserburg 1999 ) .",
    "thus , these stars would not have had time to have synthesized the first elements in the galaxy .",
    "further clues about the nature of the @xmath0-process are found in examining the abundance scatter of @xmath3-capture elements in the early galaxy .",

    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the increasing level of star - to - star scatter of [ eu / fe ] with decreasing metallicity , particularly at values below [ fe / h ] @xmath21 2.0 , suggests an early , chemically unmixed and inhomogeneous galaxy .",
    "these data also suggest that not all early stars are sites for the formation of both @xmath0-process nuclei and iron . instead",

    "these age estimates all typically have errors @xmath23 gyr resulting from both observational and nuclear uncertainties .",
    "in particular the chronometric age estimates depend sensitively upon the initial predicted values of th / eu and hence on the nuclear mass formulae and @xmath0-process models employed in making those determinations .",
    "we show , for example , in figure  [ fig8.ps ] theoretical predictions for these ratios in comparison with recent abundance determinations in 22 ( sneden et al . 2003 ) . utilizing the etfsi - q mass formula ,",

    "various explanations have been offered to explain this difference between the lighter and heavier @xmath3-capture abundance distributions : the possibility of two astrophysical sites for the @xmath0-process ( e.g. , different masses or frequencies of supernovae , or a combination of supernovae and neutron star binary mergers ) , or models with different conditions in the same single core - collapse supernova . at this time , however , it is not clear what the exact causes are for the apparent differences in the abundance distributions of the lighter and heavier @xmath3-capture elements .",
    "while the actual site for the @xmath0-process has not been definitively identified , there have been many advances in our understanding of the astrophysical models and the related nuclear physics of this nucleosynthesis .",
    "core - collapse supernovae remain a promising site for the origin of the @xmath0-process nuclei .",
    "much of the recent focus has been on obtaining more physically reliable supernova models ( e.g. , including an improved treatment of neutrino processes ) .",
    "neutron star binary mergers , with improved treatments of their evolution and coalescence , have also been studied and can still be considered a possible site for the @xmath0-process . accompanying these",
    "improved astrophysical models has been more experimental nuclear data and more reliable theoretical prescriptions for neutron - rich nuclei far from stability .",
    "the abundance patterns in the oldest galactic halo stars have also provided additional new insights into the origins and sites of the @xmath0-process .",
    "first , the elemental and isotopic abundances in the oldest halo stars are consistent with an @xmath0-process - only origin at the earliest times in the history of the galaxy .",
    "these results suggest that the @xmath0-process sites in the earliest stellar generations , the progenitors of the halo stars , were rapidly evolving  ejecting @xmath0-process - rich material into the interstellar medium long before the major onset of galactic @xmath6-process nucleosynthesis from low- and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "in addition , the star - to - star abundance scatter ( e.g. , [ eu / fe ] ) observed in the lowest metallicity ( i.e. , oldest ) galactic halo stars places strong constraints on models of nucleosynthesis and suggests that not all early stars were sites for the formation of both @xmath0-process nuclei and iron .",
    "further , this abundance scatter suggests an early chemically unmixed galaxy .",
    "the detection of the long - lived chronometers thorium , and now uranium , in some of the metal - poor halo stars has allowed for the radioactive dating of the oldest stars .",
    "this technique depends sensitively upon the observed stellar values and the theoretical predictions of the initial abundance ratios ( th / eu , th / u , etc . ) of elements synthesized in the @xmath0-process .",
    "while there have been significant advances in nuclear physics , both in experiment and theory , we still need to better define the properties of very @xmath3-rich ( radioactive ) nuclei .",
    "these improvements will be necessary to better understand the origin and nature of the @xmath0-process and to reduce chronometric age uncertainties  strengthening the radioactive dating technique , and providing more precise age estimates for the galaxy and the universe .    .",
    "we thank all of our colleagues for their contributions to the work described here .",
    "we also thank the referee , friedel thielemann , for helpful comments .",
