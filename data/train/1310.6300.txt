    "entanglement is an inherent consequence in the multipartite quantum systems . as a physical resource",
    ", quantum entanglement has many important applications in quantum computation and quantum information @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that a fundamental question in the theory of entanglement is how to characterize and quantify entanglement @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the characterization for multipartite entangled states has been considerably developed .",
    "since local unitary operations can not affect the intrinsic nature of entanglement , the nonlocal properties of a quantum state are related to entanglement .",
    "the classification of a bipartite system under local unitary operators can be done by singular value decomposition @xcite . under stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) ,",
    "a three - qubit entangled pure state can be converted either to the ghz - state or to the w - state @xcite . in the case of four qubits",
    "entangled pure state , it was shown @xcite that there exist nine classes of states . recently , for a pure multipartite entangled state , liu _",
    "et al _ @xcite propose a method for the local unitary classification by using the symmetry and tensor decomposition .",
    "for quantification of the entanglement , as is well - known , one can take the concurrence @xcite as a measure of bipartite entanglement states . in 2000 , coffman _",
    "et al _ @xcite proposed the three - tangle which is a measure of genuine tripartite entanglement .",
    "next the generalization of three - tangle to @xmath3-tangle for multi - qubit has been derived @xcite .",
    "more recently , sharma _ et al _ reported @xcite two expressions of four - tangle to quantify genuine four - body correlations by constructing polynomial invariants under local unitary operations .",
    "quantum theory allows correlations between spatially separated systems , while the local hidden variable ( lhv ) theory gives an upper bound to quantify nonlocality for a certain inequality .",
    "a famous inequality as a way of verifying predications of quantum mechanics versus those of all possible lhv theories was first proposed by bell @xcite . in 1969 , clauser _ et al _ derived another correlation inequality , the clauser - horner - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite , which also provides a way of experimentally testing the lhv theory as an independent hypothesis separated from the quantum formalism .",
    "it has been proved that @xcite for the standard projective measurements all pure entangled states of two - qubit violate the correlation chsh inequality .",
    "thus the chsh inequality can be used as a tool for testing the quantum formalism against the lhv theory and testing for entanglement within the quantum formalism . in the case of three parties",
    "acn _ et al _ @xcite considered a bell inequality and showed that all three - partite pure entangled states violate it .",
    "we noticed that there are two bell - type inequalities for four qubits have been derived .",
    "one is sasa inequality @xcite that is maximally violated by the four - qubit cluster state and another is wyko inequality @xcite that is maximally violated by the four - qubit entangled state @xcite @xmath4 for the @xmath5-qubit case , the best - known inequality is the mermin - ardehali - belinski - klyshko ( mabk ) inequality @xcite , which is included in the werner - wolf - ukowski - brukner ( wwzb ) inequality @xcite as a special case and has been proved that quantum violation of this inequality increases with the number of particles . also , there are other inequalities used to characterize entanglement property , such as , svetlichny inequality @xcite , mermin inequality @xcite , bell - type inequality @xcite , and so on .",
    "generally speaking , violation of these inequalities by entangled states is a signature of entanglement of quantum states and the magnitude of violation increases with the entanglement of state .    in this paper",
    ", we mainly study of the four - qubit entanglement and discuss the nonlocality for several canonical four - partite entangled states . in the hilbert space @xmath6 , a general four - qubit pure state may be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the complex coefficients with the basis vectors @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the locations of qubits , respectively .",
    "consider only one class , the so called  generic class \" in nine classes for four - qubit entangled pure state @xcite .",
    "more exactly , if a generic pure state of four qubits can always be transformed to the generic family @xmath12 under slocc , then the pure state is in the generic class , where the complex parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 satisfy the normalization condition @xmath17 and for the sake of simplicity throughout this paper we only concern the cases where all @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are real numbers .",
    "we notice that although the four - tangle @xcite of the state ( [ psi ] ) is 1 , i.e. @xmath18 ^ 2|=1 $ ] , this class of the states contains four - qubit cluster - state , the ghz - state , the two - epr - pair - state , the maximal four - partite entangled state @xmath19 ( it will be defined later ) .",
    "next we introduce a bell - type inequality with different violations yielded by different entangled states . especially , the maximal violation yields with the four - qubit maximal entangled state @xmath19 .",
    "based on the assumption of local realism , where all four qubits are locally but realistically correlated , we introduce a linear bell - type inequality that is maximally violated by the four - qubit maximal entangled state @xmath20 in the structure of our inequality , we suppose that every observer is allowed to choose between two dichotomic observables .",
    "more precisely , there is an ensemble of four spatially separated qubits and the measurements @xmath21 or @xmath22 are performed on qubit 1 , @xmath23 or @xmath24 are performed on qubit 2 , @xmath25 or @xmath26 are performed on qubit 3 , and @xmath27 or @xmath28 are performed on qubit 4 , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are unit vectors , @xmath34 is pauli operator .",
    "we define the bell - type operator @xmath35 apparently , eq.([b ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath36 in terms of absolute local realism , each outcome @xmath37 ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) can either take value @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "it is easy to obtain the results that either @xmath42 and @xmath43 , or @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "suppose next that @xmath46 is the probability that , before the measurements are performed , the system is in a state where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . let correlation function @xmath55 denote the average over many runs of the experiment , then we have @xmath56 also , @xmath57 combining inequality ( [ b_1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ b_2 ] ) the following bell - type inequality holds for the predetermined results : @xmath58 ) holds for lhv theories .",
    "versus @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath59.,title=\"fig:\",width=384 ] +    then , we use the inequality to test the quantum nonlocality of the four - qubit maximally entangled state @xmath19 . under the experimental setting @xmath60 , @xmath61",
    ", the bell - type operator reads @xmath62 we notice that @xmath63 and @xmath64 it is worth noting that there are 16 operators @xmath65 satisfying the eigenvalue equations @xmath66 , namely , @xmath67 @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is identity operator . from the above @xmath71 operators , we choose four operators and combine them as shown in eq.([b - sigma ] ) .",
    "quantum mechanically , therefore we derive the result of the expectation value of the bell - type operator @xmath72 stated in eq.([b - sigma ] ) for the four - qubit maximally entangled state @xmath1 , that is , @xmath73 this is indeed a violation of the inequality ( [ inequality ] ) where the lhv bound is 2 . obviously , the maximum of @xmath74 is 4 . under the optimal",
    "setting , the maximal violation of the bell - inequality reaches up to its maximum 4 for the four - qubit maximally entangled state @xmath75 .",
    "so our inequality , in a sense , is optimal and can also be acted as a strong entanglement witness for the entangled state @xmath75 .",
    "this is also the reason why we call @xmath75 the maximal entangled state .",
    "now , we study the quantum nonlocality of the generic family @xmath0 using the above operator @xmath72 stated by eq.([b - sigma ] ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath76 + ( b - c)(a+d)+(b+c)(a - d )   \\nonumber \\\\            &   & + ( a - d)(a+d)+(b+c)(b - c)+(b+c)(a+d)+(b - c)(a - d )   \\nonumber \\\\            & = & 2(a+b)^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] under the constraint condition , @xmath77 , we plot the quantum prediction @xmath78 versus @xmath13 and @xmath14 as shown in fig.[p - b - ab ] .",
    "obviously , the violation of the inequality numerically depends on @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "next we discuss several examples of our bell - type inequality for some special four - qubit entangled states .",
    "( ) for the four - qubit maximal entangled state @xmath75 , the maximum violation reaches up to the maximum value @xmath79 and thus we claim that our inequality is optimal bell - type inequality for the four - qubit maximal entangled state @xmath75 .",
    "( ) for the four - qubit ghz state @xmath80 , we obtain @xmath81 .",
    "that is , the inequality is not violated by the four - qubit ghz state .",
    "( ) for the two - epr - pair state , that is the state @xmath82 , the quantum prediction is 2 and it does not violate the inequality .",
    "( ) for the four - qubit cluster state @xmath83 , @xmath84 , the inequality is not violated .",
    "( ) for the entangled state @xmath85 investigated by wu _",
    "et al _ @xcite , @xmath86 , it does not violate the inequality .",
    "( ) for the state @xmath87 $ ] introduced by higuchi and sudbery @xcite , we have @xmath88 and the inequality is not violated .",
    "( ) for the state @xmath89 as a candidate of maximally entangled state found by brown _",
    "et al _ @xcite , @xmath90 , the inequality is not violated .",
    "( ) for the four - qubit w state @xmath91 , we obtain @xmath92 , which means that the inequality is violated by the four - qubit w state .",
    "a remarkable feature of our inequality is that there exists a family of the four - qubit entangled states where all states violate the inequality .",
    "the family reads @xmath93 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 satisfy @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "consider genuine four - tangle for four - qubit states recently reported by sharma _",

    "four - tangle is @xmath98 . in the light of the result in eq.([b - ab ] ) we obtain a useful relationship between four - partite entanglement ( four - tangle ) and nonlocality for the family of the four - qubit entangled states , that is , @xmath99 fig.[p - b - tau ] shows the quantum nonlocality versus four - tangle for the family of the four - qubit entangled states @xmath100 .",
    "it has been shown that quantum violation of the inequality ( [ inequality ] ) varies with four - tangle @xmath97 and when @xmath101 ( i.e. , @xmath102 ) the maximal violation yields .    ,",
    "which violate inequality ( [ inequality]).,title=\"fig:\",width=384 ] +",
    "in summary , we propose a four - qubit bell - type inequality .",
    "the inequality is maximally violated by the four - qubit maximal entangled state @xmath1 which do not violate sasa inequality @xcite and wyko inequality @xcite .",
    "we study the quantum nonlocality of the generic family @xmath0 and several four - qubit states using our inequality and show that it is also violated by the four - qubit w state and a family of the four - qubit entangled states @xmath2 while it is not violated by the four - qubit ghz state , the four - qubit cluster state , the two - epr - pair state and the state @xmath103 .",
    "also , we derive a useful relationship between four - partite entanglement and nonlocality for the family of the four - qubit entangled states @xmath2 .",
    "note that our inequality is easier to test experimentally because it requires two settings and only four terms .",
    "therefore , the specific derivation results in our inequality indicate that it can act as a strong entanglement witness for the family @xmath2 . the discovery of the entanglement - nonlocality relationship , as well as the results reported in references @xcite , will greatly facilitate the development of entanglement and their application in quantum information processing @xcite .",
