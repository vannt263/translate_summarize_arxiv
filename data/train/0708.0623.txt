    "the present paper focuses on the local electronic structure of the charge - ordered crystallographic structure of la@xmath2ca@xmath2mno@xmath3 . for this purpose",
    "we have studied an embedded cluster containing two corner - sharing mno@xmath12 octahedra using the crystal structure determined by radealli _ _ et al.__@xcite the two mn ions in the cluster have different coordination spheres .",
    "one site is jahn - teller distorted , while the other has six ( almost ) equivalent , rather short mn - o distances .",
    "the two sites are commonly interpreted as occupied by mn@xmath8(3@xmath13 ) and mn@xmath10(3@xmath14 ) , respectively . according to the position of the holes , different electronic orders are expected :    * if the holes are localized on the mn sites , the resulting seven unpaired electron system is of mixed valence nature .",
    "the de mechanism induces a resonance between mn@xmath8o@xmath9mn@xmath10 and mn@xmath10o@xmath9mn@xmath8 which in that peculiar case will result in a charge ordering of the electronic structure i.e. a partial localization of the e@xmath15-like extra electron ( or hole ) on one mn ion mn@xmath16o@xmath9mn@xmath17 . the t@xmath18-like electrons are unpaired and strongly localized on each ion . *",
    "if the holes are localized on the bridging oxygen , the corresponding charge distribution suggests a dominant purely magnetic local order ( mn@xmath8o@xmath19mn@xmath8 ) in which the cluster would be a ferrimagnetic entity involving a magnetic oxygen and therefore nine unpaired electrons .",
    "the model hamiltonian that provides a relevant description of such a local electronic order is a heisenberg hamiltonian involving non - symmetric exchange integrals between each mn ion and the magnetic oxygen .    in order",
    "to decide which hamiltonian is most appropriate to describe the local electronic structure of this non - symmetric two - center cluster , we compare the different model spectra with the _ ab initio _ one .",
    "the here - used procedure consists in extracting the local effective interactions of the model hamiltonians from calculations performed with the exact electronic hamiltonian . for this purpose ,",

    "the heisenberg and de models as well as their analytical solutions are derived in section iii .",
    "finally , the comparison of the model spectra with the _ ab initio _ one is discussed in the fourth section .",

    "the cluster is embedded in a set of optimized point charges which accurately reproduces the madelung potential of the crystal . total ion potentials ( tip )",

    "additional information can be found in ref . , where it is shown that this embedding provides reliable results on the ground state of the system .",

    "accurate relative energies of the ground state and lowest excited electronic states are computed by introducing the dynamical electron correlation in a subsequent second - order perturbation treatment applied to the zeroth - order casscf wave function .    using the _ ab initio _ spectrum and the effective hamiltonian theory of bloch,@xcite it is possible to extract the main electronic interactions of the different models .",
    "since the number of electronic interactions is smaller than the number of electronic states described by the model space , the value of the effective interactions is fitted to optimally reproduce the _ ab initio _ spectrum . the mean error per state",
    "can be evaluated with the following expression : @xmath32 where @xmath30 is the number of states described by the model hamiltonian , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are respectively the _ ab initio _ and model energies of state @xmath35 , and @xmath36 the _ ab initio _ spectrum width .    both the comparison of the so - obtained model spectra to the _ ab initio _ one and the size of the error per state give rational arguments to discriminate between different modelizations .",
    "if the holes are essentially localized on the oxygens o@xmath37 then the wave functions of the lower energy states are dominated by electronic configurations with nine unpaired electrons .",

    "i.e. with @xmath57 , the electronic structure of the cluster is such that the extra electron ( or hole ) is partially localized on one of the two mn ions .",
    "the nuclear relaxation resulting from this partial localization results in an enlargement of the coordination sphere ( an increase of the average mn - o distance ) of the mn ion bearing the extra electron and a contraction of the coordination sphere of the mn ion bearing the hole .",

    "a large difference between the two extracted values has already been observed in other studies.@xcite the participation of non - hund states in the _ ab initio _ wave function enhances the covalent character of the interaction between the mn sites . their explicit inclusion in the model space results in an antiferromagnetic contribution , i.e. it stabilizes the low and intermediate spin states . in order to reproduce this antiferromagnetic contribution , the usual de model overestimates the value of the antiferromagnetic exchange integral @xmath88 and underestimates the value of @xmath72 , i.e. of the ferromagnetic contribution .",

    "the octet potential energy curve is the lowest state over the whole interval for the refined de model .",
    "this qualitative disagreement between the usual de model and the _ ab initio _",

    "hence , this interaction , which is the largest interaction of the de mechanism , should induce a high spin ground state .",
    "however , the artificially large @xmath88 makes that the hopping interaction is not large enough to restaure a ferromagnetic order in the usual de model . as a consequence , the lowest potential energy well is the doublet state one .",

    "owing to the antiferromagnetic contribution of the non - hund states in the refined de model , the optimized exchange integral @xmath88 is properly estimated and both the spectrum at the experimental geometry and the potential energy curves of the different states reproduce the correct physics of the system .",
    "the extraction of local electronic structure parameters in the ce - phase of the half - doped manganite la@xmath2ca@xmath2mno@xmath3 reveals that the local physics can accurately be described with a model hamiltonian that includes the usual double exchange physics of mixed valence compounds plus an additional term due to the non - hund states .",
    "the large @xmath72-value ( 1.3 ev ) indicates a rather mobile electron and hence small charge disproportionation .",
    "in fact , mulliken population analysis associates a slightly higher charge to the mn - ion in the jahn - teller distorted site .",
    "the difference between both sites is 0.07 electron .",
    "although absolute mulliken charges are not reliable , the relative values can be considered as indicative for tendencies . moreover ,",
    "the observed charge disproportionation of 0.07 is consistent with the maximum of 0.18 predicted in model hamiltonian studies.@xcite    the pks model provides a simple recipe to obtain the potential energy curves of the low - lying states as function of the distortion parameter @xmath58 and hence obtain more detailed information about the local electronic physics .",
    "the curves for the low - lying states show a double well , where the minimum of the high spin ground state curve lies at q @xmath102 0.38 .",
    "this corresponds to a situation in between the completely delocalized solution with @xmath92  =  0 and the completely localized solution for @xmath92=@xmath1021 .",
    "the latter solution has a disproportionation of 1 electron while for the @xmath92=0 situation there is no barrier and the charge disproportionation has completely disappeared.@xcite    the height of the barrier between left and right localized solutions is 0.04 ev for the octet ground state of the embedded cluster .",
    "our model study only considers local distortions around the two mn - sites considered in the cluster and the collective nature of the distortions in the ce - phase could lead to higher barriers .",
    "obviously these effects should be included in order to be conclusive about the nature of the local electronic structure of the half - doped manganite ; charge ordered or delocalized ( zener polaron ) as proposed in ref . . nevertheless , the smallness of the barrier is in line with the two different interpretations obtained by experimentalists and the controversy in the literature .",
