    "the filled skutterudite compound pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 has been reported to exhibit superconductivity below a critical temperature @xmath11 k that develops out of a heavy fermi liquid with an effective mass @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the free electron mass @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 is the first heavy fermion superconductor based on pr ; all of the other known heavy fermion superconductors ( about @xmath12 ) are compounds of ce or u. the superconducting state appears to be unconventional in nature and may consist of two distinct superconducting phases @xcite .",
    "an ordered phase , presumably of magnetic or quadrupolar origin , occurs at high fields @xmath13 t and low temperatures @xmath14 k @xcite , suggesting that the superconductivity may occur in the vicinity of a magnetic or quadrupolar quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "analysis of magnetic susceptibility @xmath15 , specific heat @xmath16 , electrical resistivity @xmath17 and inelastic neutron scattering measurements within the context of a cubic crystalline electric field ( cef ) yields a pr@xmath5 energy level scheme that consists of a @xmath6 nonmagnetic doublet ground state that carries an electric quadrupole moment , a low lying @xmath7 triplet excited state at @xmath8 k , and @xmath9 triplet and @xmath10 singlet excited states at much higher temperatures ( @xmath18 k and @xmath19 k , respectively ) @xcite .",
    "this scenario suggests that the underlying mechanism of the heavy fermion behavior in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 may involve the interaction of pr@xmath5 electric quadrupole moments with the charges of the conduction electrons , rather than the interaction of pr@xmath5 magnetic dipole moments with the spins of the conduction electrons , the interaction that is widely believed to be responsible for the heavy fermion state in most ce- and u - based compounds .",
    "it also raises the possibility that electric quadrupole fluctuations play a role in the superconductivity of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 . in this paper , we briefly review the current experimental situation regarding the heavy fermion state , the superconducting state , and a high field , low temperature phase that is apparently associated with magnetic or electric quadrupolar order in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "the first evidence for a heavy fermion state in the filled skutterudite compound pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 emerged from specific heat @xmath16 measurements on a pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 pressed pellet ( formed by pressing a collection of small single crystals in a cylindrical die ) at low temperatures .",
    "specific heat data in the form of a plot of @xmath20 vs @xmath21 between @xmath22 k and @xmath23 k for the pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 pressed pellet from refs . @xcite and @xcite are shown in fig .",

    "the best fit of this expression to the data yields the values @xmath29 = @xmath30 mj / mol k@xmath31 , @xmath32 mj / mol k@xmath33 ( corresponding to a debye temperature @xmath34 k ) , and @xmath35 k. superimposed on the schottky anomaly is a feature in the specific heat due to the onset of superconductivity at @xmath11 k which is also observed as an abrupt drop in @xmath17 to zero and as a sharp onset of diamagnetism in @xmath36 .",
    "the feature in @xmath37 due to the superconductivity is also shown in the top inset of fig .",
    "[ heat ] along with an entropy conserving construction from which the ratio of the jump in specific heat @xmath38 at @xmath39 , @xmath40 mj / mol k@xmath31 , has been estimated . using the bcs relation @xmath41 , this yields a value for @xmath29 of @xmath42 mj / mol k@xmath31 . the value of @xmath43 is larger than that",
    "reported in ref .",
    "@xcite due to the correction of the @xmath16 data for the excess sb ( about @xmath44 percent of the total mass ) .",
    "this value is comparable to that inferred from the fit to the @xmath20 vs @xmath21 data in the normal state above @xmath39 , and indicative of heavy fermion behavior . a similar analysis of the @xmath16 data taken at the university of karlsruhe on several single crystals of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 prepared in our laboratory yielded @xmath45 mj / mol k@xmath31 , @xmath46 k , @xmath47 k , and @xmath48 , much higher than the bcs value of @xmath49 and indicative of strong coupling effects @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that we also find a large value of @xmath50 in recent @xmath16 measurements on one single crystal of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 at ucsd .",
    "although the values of @xmath29 determined from these experiments vary somewhat , they are all indicative of a heavy electron ground state and an effective mass @xmath3 .    further evidence of heavy fermion superconductivity is provided by the upper critical field @xmath51 vs @xmath21 curve which is shown in fig .",

    "in contrast to the similarity in the fermi surface topologies of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 and laos@xmath0sb@xmath1 , the cyclotron effective masses @xmath62 of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 are up to @xmath63 times enhanced compared to those of laos@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath29 estimated from the fermi surface volume and the value of @xmath62 , assuming a spherical fermi surface , is @xmath64 mj / mol k@xmath31 , which is two to three times smaller than the value of @xmath29 inferred from the normal and superconducting properties of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",

    "in contrast , magnetic dipole fluctuations are widely believed to be responsible for the heavy fermion state in most ce and u heavy fermion compounds ( with the possible exception of certain u compounds such as ube@xmath103 ) .",
    "another possible source of the enhanced effective mass in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 may involve excitations from the ground state to the the low lying first excited state in the pr@xmath5 cef energy level scheme @xcite .",

    "it was concluded that the a @xmath10 ground state could not be ruled out on the basis of this experiment .",
    "however , it should be noted that these @xmath113 studies are difficult to interpret because of the curvature of @xmath114 and the complications that arise at lower temperatures @xmath115 and lower fields @xmath116 due to the superconductivity and at temperatures @xmath117 k and higher fields @xmath118 k by the onset of the high field ordered phase , discussed in section @xmath98 .",
    "several features in the superconducting properties of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 indicate that the superconductivity of this compound is unconventional in nature .",

    "@xcite , @xmath119 follows a power law with @xmath121 when the schottky anomaly is not subtracted .",

    "this structure is not evident in the @xmath16 data taken on the pressed pellet of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 shown in the upper inset of fig .",
    "[ heat ] , possibly due to strains in the single crystals out of which the pressed pellet is comprised that broaden the transitions at @xmath124 and @xmath125 so that they overlap and become indistinguishable .",
    "however , at this point , it is not clear whether these two apparent jumps in @xmath16 are associated with two distinct superconducting phases or are due to sample inhomogeneity .",
    "it is noteworthy that all of the single crystal specimens prepared in our laboratory and investigated by our group and our collaborators exhibit this ` double - step ' structure .",

    "measurements of the specific heat in magnetic fields reveal that the two superconducting features shift downward in temperature at nearly the same rate with increasing field , consistent with the smooth temperature dependence of the @xmath130 curve @xcite .",

    "these measurements reveal two regions in the @xmath132 plane , a low field region in which @xmath133 has two point nodes , and a high field region where @xmath133 has six point nodes .",
    "the line lying between the low and high field superconducting phases may be associated with the transition at @xmath125 , whereas the line between the high field phase and the normal phase , @xmath130 , converges with @xmath124 as @xmath134 .",
    "clearly , more research will be required to further elucidate the nature of the superconducting state in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
