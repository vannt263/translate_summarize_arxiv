    "diffusion processes are markovian random processes with continuous sample paths . from a mathematical point of view",
    "they are characterized , in one dimension , by two functions : the drift , @xmath0 , and a positive defined diffusion coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "the sample paths of any diffusion process can thus be pictured as the continuous trajectory resulting from the superposition of a deterministic evolution , governed by @xmath0 , and fluctuations around it , the latter determined by @xmath2 . denoting the process by @xmath3 ,",
    "the diffusion picture becomes apparent by the fact that the time evolution of @xmath3 is ruled by the stochastic differential equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the wiener process , that is , a gaussian process with zero mean , unit variance and correlation function @xmath6 . in what follows",
    "all stochastic differentials are interpreted in the sense of ito .",
    "the feller process is a special kind of diffusion process with linear drift and linear diffusion coefficient vanishing at the origin @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the process is thus governed by @xmath7dt+k\\sqrt{y(t)}dw(t ) , \\label{sde1}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are constant parameters .",
    "both feller and orstein - uhlenbeck processes ( diffusion processes also with linear drift but constant diffusion coefficient ) have been widely used , with a marked prominence of the latter , in the modeling of countless physical phenomena .",
    "both share a linear drift , @xmath11 , which for @xmath8 results in a restoring force that , in the absence of noise , makes both processes decay toward the value @xmath9 .",
    "however , and contrary to the ornstein - uhlenbek process where diffusion is constant , the feller process has a state - dependent diffusion coefficient , @xmath12 , which for large values of @xmath13 enhances the effects of noise while as @xmath13 goes to zero the effect of noise vanishes .",
    "hence , when the process reaches the origin , the drift drags it toward the value @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath14 the process , starting at some positive value , can not reach the negative region which , in turn , renders the process always non - negative ( otherwise the noise term in eq .",
    "( [ sde1 ] ) would become imaginary ) .",
    "therefore , for the feller process the origin is a singular boundary that the process can not cross .",
    "a related question is whether or not the origin is accessible , in other words , whether the value @xmath15 can or can not be attained by the process .",
    "this is a crucial question in many practical situations and , as we will prove later , the answer depends on the particular value taken by a parameter which balances the values of @xmath9 and @xmath16 .",
    "the problem of classifying the different types of boundaries appearing in diffusion processes was thoroughly studied by feller himself during the 1950 s and we refer the reader to the literature for a more complete account on the subject @xcite .    possessing a state - dependent diffusion and , most importantly ,",
    "the fact that the process never attains negative values have made feller process and ideal candidate for modeling a number of phenomena in natural and social sciences .",
    "theoretical biology was one of the first places where the process was , during 1970 s , seriously considered  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most prominent place is within the context of neurobiology in order to model firing of single neurons  @xcite .",
    "the feller neuronal model is one of the so - called stochastic integrate and fire models which are simple models aiming to reproduce the membrane potential fluctuations .",
    "experimental progresses has lead to the possibility of fitting real data to the feller neuronal model among many others  @xcite .    in a different context capocelli and ricciardi",
    "@xcite considered the possibility of modeling biological population with the feller process in order to include environmental randomness to the classic malthusian growth rate  @xcite .",
    "the approach  @xcite represents in fact an alternative to the lotka - volterra models in ecosystems and the interest in this sort of problems is mostly focused on the extinction that is , on the possibility of attaining the singular boundary @xmath15 and also on the unrestricted growth  @xcite .",
    "financial markets is another field where the feller process is widely used .",
    "it was introduced in 1985 to model term structure of interest rates receiving the name of cox , ingersoll , ross ( cir ) model and successfully evaluate bond prices  @xcite .",
    "the process is also being considered to provide a random character to the volatility of a given stock .",
    "volatility obeying the feller model jointly with a log - brownian stochastic dynamics for the asset price evolution configure a two - dimensional diffusion market process called heston model  @xcite which is a rather useful model specially for option pricing  @xcite .    in all of the above mentioned situations susceptible to be modeled with a feller process",
    ", the first - passage time events related , among others , to level - crossing and the triggering of a given signal are very significant phenomena for different reasons which depend on each context .",
    "this is for instance the case of the neuronal activity since a spike generation is due to the crossing of a threshold by the membrane potential signal . additionally , population extinctions of any type or volatility bursts in financial markets are also important phenomena to model and study .",
    "first - passage time is , however , a difficult topic  @xcite . to our knowledge , for the feller process",
    "this crucial facet has been scantily studied and only partially solved some years ago in the context of single neuron firing  @xcite .",
    "it is our main objective to address the first - passage time properties of process ( [ sde1 ] ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ gen_prop ]",
    ", we introduce the general properties of the unrestricted probability density of the feller model .",
    "section  [ fp ] is devoted to the derivation of the first - passage time and escape probabilities with special attention to a couple of specific situations .",
    "section  [ mfpt ] is mostly focused on the derivation of the mean first - passage time .",
    "we finally summarize the results obtained in section  [ summary ] .",
    "before addressing the main issue of this paper , let us briefly review the main traits of the process and the role of the boundary at the origin .",
    "for the rest of the paper in turns out to be convenient to scale time and the process itself in the following way ( recall we have assumed @xmath8 ) @xmath17 so that the langevin equation ( [ sde1 ] ) reads @xmath18dt'+\\sqrt{2x(t')}dw(t ' ) , \\label{sde2}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the only free parameter left .",
    "its relation to @xmath9 and @xmath20 is @xmath21 this parameter is called `` saturation level '' or `` normal level '' and it is the value to which the feller process @xmath22 is attracted to",
    ". as we will shortly see , @xmath19 has a key role in the behavior of the process .",

    "is that the probability flux of the process through @xmath29 is zero @xcite .",

    "the final expression reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a modified bessel function defined as @xcite @xmath34    from eq .",

    "after reviewing the main traits of the feller process we will now focus on level - crossing problems a collective name embracing questions such as hitting , first - passage , escape and extreme values , among others for that process . according to whether we are dealing with one - sided or two - sided barrier problems",
    ", we separate level crossing into two different issues . in one of them ,",
    "the hitting or first - passage problem , we deal with the time that the process reaches some `` critical '' value , or `` threshold '' , for the first time . the second issue , albeit closely related to the first one , concerns the time when the process first leaves a given interval .",
    "this is the so - called escape or exit problem .",
    "let us first address the first - passage problem for the feller process .",

    "feller process has the property of being positive , a salient characteristic which has earned the process some popularity in modeling several phenomena , from neural activity to financial markets .",

    "the origin is a singular boundary because the noise term vanishes there . in sec .",
    "[ gen_prop ] we have reviewed the general properties of the processes which were mostly obtained by feller many years ago .",
    "one of these properties refer to the attainability of the origin in which the normal level plays a crucial role .",

    "the bulk of the paper is developed in secs .",
    "[ fp ] and [ mfpt ] where the first - passage and escape properties of the feller process are thoroughly analyzed .",
    "the first - passage problem refers to the crossing by the process of certain preassigned critical level or threshold @xmath43 while the escape problem refers to the departure of some interval @xmath117 .",
    "the first - passage properties are fully characterized by the hitting , or first - passage probability , defined as the probability of first reaching the threshold @xmath43 by the process at time @xmath120 or before .",
    "we denote by @xmath44 this probability , where @xmath24 is the initial position of the process .",
    "this probability depends on whether the process is initially below ( @xmath63 ) or above ( @xmath67 ) threshold .",

    "there are some instances , however , in which we have been able to obtain analytical expressions in real time .",
    "this is the case of hitting the origin which has a significant interest in the firing of neurons and also in the heston volatility model of the financial analysis .",

    "in such a case @xmath209 where @xmath113 is the incomplete gamma function .",
    "the escape problem is completely characterized by the escape probability , @xmath193 , defined as the probability of first leaving a given interval @xmath117 .",
    "it is complementary to the survival probability @xmath210 : @xmath211 where @xmath118 is the probability that the process has not exited @xmath117 at time @xmath120 or during any previous instant of time .",
    "formally , @xmath212    for the feller process we have been able to obtain the exact expression for the laplace transform of the escape probability which turns out to be more involved than the first - passage probability .",

    "we have next addressed the problem of the mean - first passage time ( mfpt ) and the mean exit time ( met ) .",
    "we have shown that in terms of the first - passage time moments @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) of which the mfpt corresponds to @xmath214 , @xmath215) the laplace transform of the hitting probability reads @xmath216 the mfpt to the threshold @xmath43 is then given by @xmath217.\\ ] ] from these expressions we have been able to obtain , in terms of the mfpt , the following long - time asymptotic expression of the hitting probability @xmath218    for the feller process this analysis has led to different results according to whether initially the system is placed below or above the threshold : @xmath219 the mfpt to reach the origin , @xmath170 , has also been analyzed with the result @xmath220 which constitute an additional proof of the fact that when @xmath41 the singular boundary @xmath29 is unattainable .    the analysis of the mfpt can be exactly carried out for the met .",
    "the resulting expressions relating the met with the escape probability are formally the same as those relating the mfpt with the hitting probability as can be seen in sec .",
