    "in a standard imaging system , light scattered from an object forms a diffraction pattern which encodes information about the object fourier components .",

    "title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=20.0% ] , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=20.0% ]    these ideas , along with the development of powerful light sources , producing collimated beams of coherent x - rays , enabled the development of coherent x - ray diffraction microscopy @xcite ( aka lensless or diffractive imaging ) .",
    "this technique aims at imaging , through coherent illumination , fourier amplitude measurements and adequate sampling , macroscopic objects such as entire cellular organisms @xcite , or nanoporous aerogel structures @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a review .",
    "diffraction microscopy solves the phase problem using increasingly sophisticated algorithms based on the support constraint , which assumes adequate sampling .",
    "the object being imaged is limited within a support region @xmath0 : @xmath1    the sampling conditions required to benefit from the support constraint have limited the adoption of projection algorithms to other experimental geometries that allow only for sub - nyquist sampling , most notably bragg sampling from periodic crystalline structures .",
    "modern sampling theory however , tells us that that nyquist sampling conditions dictated by the support are the worst case scenario for an arbitrary object . in other words ,",
    "shannon was a pessimist : he did not account for the signal structure .",
    "compressive sensing theory tells us that the number of measurements are dictated by the signal structure rather than it s length . by structured",
    "we mean that the signal has only a few non - zero coefficients when represented in terms of some basis , or can be well approximated well by a few non zero coefficients : they can be described in terms of a few atoms , a few stars , a few wavelet coefficients , or possibly a few protein folds .",
    "in other words , an object of interest is often sparse or concentrated in a small number of non - zero coefficients in a well chosen basis , i.e. it can be compressed with no or almost no loss of information .",
    "the meanings of `` well - chosen '' and `` of interest '' are slightly circular : a basis is well - chosen if it succinctly describes a signal of interest ; likewise , a signal is of interest if it can be described with just a handful of basis elements . since we do not know where these few terms are located , conventional wisdom would indicate that one has to first measure the full sample at the desired resolution , since overlooking an important component of a signal seems almost inevitable if the whole haystack is nt thoroughly searched over .",
    "there would seem to be no alternative to processing each signal in its entirety before we can compress it and store only the desired information ( such as the location of the atoms in a molecule ) .    but",
    "a new theory of `` compressive sampling '' has shown how an image of interest or structured signals generally can be reconstructed , exactly , from a surprisingly small set of direct measurements .",
    "cands and colleagues @xcite have defined a notion of `` uniform uncertainty '' that guarantees , with arbitrarily high probability , an exact solution when the signal is sparse and a good approximation when it is compressible or noisy .",
    "their uniform uncertainty condition is satisfied , among others , by fourier measurements of a sparse real space object .",
    "the question of whether modern sensing theory is applicable to fourier amplitude measurements was first raised by moravec , romberg and baraniuk @xcite who provide an upper bound sampling condition for the successful retrieval of a sparse signal autocorrelation , and discuss other conjectures with far reaching consequences for low - resolution undersampled phase retrieval .",
    "since the theory is relatively new and not widely known to the phase retrieval community , modern sampling theory is briefly reviewed .",
    "the notion that a diffraction pattern from a sparse object can be reconstructed at sub - nyquist sampling is not entirely new .",
    "the so called `` direct methods '' are routinely used for atomic resolution imaging of increasing complex molecular structures .",
    "direct methods enforce the condition that the resulting molecule is composed of a finite number of atoms .",
    "the conditions for successful ab - initio phase retrieval using these methods are strict : it requires ( 1 ) atomic resolution and ( 2 ) about 5 strong peaks per atom .",
    "condition ( 2 ) means that the algorithms do not scale well with a large number of atoms since the number of strong reflections decreases rapidly with the number of atoms .",
    "suppose that one collects an incomplete set of frequency samples ( amplitude and phase ) of a discrete signal @xmath2 of length @xmath3 .",
    "the goal is to reconstruct the full signal @xmath4 given only @xmath5 samples in the fourier domain where the `` visible frequencies '' are a subset @xmath6 ( of size @xmath5 ) of the set of all frequencies @xmath7 .    at first glance ,",
    "solving the underdetermined system of equations appears hopeless , as it is easy to make up examples for which it clearly can not be done . but suppose now that the signal @xmath4 is compressible , meaning that it essentially depends on a number of degrees of freedom which is smaller than @xmath3 . then in fact , accurate and sometimes exact recovery is possible by solving a simple convex optimization problem .",
    "( candes romberg and tao @xcite ) : assume that @xmath4 is @xmath8 -sparse , ( e.g. @xmath8 atomic charges in real space with @xmath3 resolution elements ) , and that we are given @xmath5 fourier coefficients with frequencies selected uniformly at random .",
    "suppose that the number of observations obeys @xmath9 .",
    "then minimizing @xmath10 reconstructs @xmath4 exactly with overwhelming probability . in particular , writing @xmath11 , then the probability of success exceeds @xmath12 .",
    "the theorem shows that a simple convex minimization will find the exact solution without any knowledge about the support , the number of nonzero coordinates of @xmath13 , their locations , and their amplitudes which we assume are all completely unknown a priori .",
    "following @xcite we formulate this more explicitly . the algorithm that optimizes the @xmath10 norm : latexmath:[\\ ] ] although this result describes only local convergence , it shows how a few wrong peaks can be recovered easily .",
