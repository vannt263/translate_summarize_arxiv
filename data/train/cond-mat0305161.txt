    "theoretical description of the doping dependence of the superconducting properties of the high - temperature superconductors ( htscs ) is one of the most difficult problem of the modern condensed matter physics . generally speaking",
    ", the complicated crystal structure of these materials , low - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) transport properties , the superconducting order parameter anisotropy , strong correlations and other properties result in the fact that many years after the discovery the microscopic mechanism of htsc is not understood yet .    during the last years",
    "many models which take into account some of the cuprate properties have been proposed .",
    "the doping dependence of the superconducting properties at @xmath2 in the @xmath3-wave pairing channel was studied for the 3d case in @xcite and , particularly for the quasi-2d case @xcite . for the 2d case",
    "this problem was studied at @xmath2 ( when a long - range superconducting order is still possible in a 2d system @xcite ) for the case of local attraction in @xcite , and for the phonon - mediated model @xcite ( for over - review see @xcite , for example ) .",
    "the @xmath4-wave pairing along with the @xmath3-wave one at @xmath2 for the case of the extended hubbard model with the next nearest neighbor attraction was studied in @xcite and for a 2d continuum model with short - ranger attraction and electron correlations - in the paper @xcite .",
    "th properties of a model with doping dependent correlation length were studied recently in @xcite .",
    "the 2d @xmath3-wave pairing at finite temperatures , when the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition can take place in superconducting system , was considered in @xcite for the case of the model with local attraction and in @xcite for the case of the electron - phonon pairing .",
    "the problem of the @xmath3-wave superconductivity with fluctuating order parameter phase in the 3d case was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the effective action for slowly fluctuating @xmath4-wave superconducting order parameter for the 2d case was also analyzed in @xcite .",
    "however , it is known that the long - range order is impossible in the 1d and 2d systems with an order parameter which has a continuous symmetry @xcite . therefore , to get real phase transition with a long - range order and homogeneous order parameter one needs to take into account the inter - layer coupling @xmath5 .",
    "the layered superconductivity is much more complicated since the possibility of the inter - layer fluxon and intra - layer vortex phase transitions with corresponding critical temperatures @xmath6 and @xmath7 must be analyzed .",
    "it was already shown @xcite , that there is only one phase transition in such a system with the critical temperature @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath8 is equal to @xmath7 , or , what is equivalent , to the temperature @xmath1 of the 2d bkt phase transition at @xmath10 .",
    "then , this temperature value is increasing to the value @xmath6 with the inter - layer hopping @xmath5 growth . in the papers @xcite the phase order parameter effective hamiltonian was studied in the presence of an external magnetic field and this model was mapped on the quasi-2d xy - model .",
    "the xy - model parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 were considered as phenomenological constants . it was shown that @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    in this paper we derive the effective xy - hamiltonian from the initial hamiltonian for the layered system of attracting fermions . in this case",
    "the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 depend on the bare parameters - charge carrier density , coupling , pair angular momentum , temperature and the inter - layer hopping .",
    "as it will be shown below , this leads to the non - trivial dependence of the superconducting critical temperature @xmath0 on the model parameters .",
    "in particular , in general this temperature is different from the critical temperature of the 2d bkt transition and @xmath15 at some values of the model parameters , contrary to the results for the case when parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 do nt depend on the parameters of the microscopic hamiltonian , and when the relation @xmath15 always holds at @xmath16 @xcite .",

    "the behavior in each plane is independent and the system undergoes the bkt transition . let us assume that the order parameter phase fluctuations are small . in this case to get the thermodynamic potential up to the second order in @xmath77 we neglect all the terms in ( [ omegakin ] ) , except @xmath78 .",
    "also we neglect the time dependence of @xmath79 and the second derivative @xmath80 .",

    "the solution of the gap equation together with the number equation at @xmath99 give the critical temperature of the mean - field superconducting transition @xmath100 on the charge carrier density @xmath91 .",
    "the solution of the equation @xmath101 together with the gap equation and the number equation give the dependence of the critical temperature of the bkt - transition on the charge carrier density @xmath91 .",
    "equation ( [ tbkt ] ) is obtained by mapping ( [ omega2d ] ) on the corresponding thermodynamic potential of the 2d spin xy - model .    as it follows from the system ( [ gap ] ) , ( [ number ] ) and ( [ tbkt ] ) , the solution for the @xmath102 and @xmath1 do not depend on @xmath94 when @xmath103 for the case of the simple interaction potential ( [ vpk ] ) .",
    "this follows from the fact that the @xmath94-dependence of the integral is only as @xmath104 and from the identity @xmath105 = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\frac{d\\varphi}{(2\\pi ) } f\\left [ \\cos^{2}(\\varphi)\\right ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath106 $ ] is an arbitrary function without singularities , and @xmath94 is an arbitrary non - zero integer number .",
    "therefore it is necessary to analyze the solutions with @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the phase diagram of the system in the 2d case is presented in the fig.1 .",
    "the temperature @xmath102 is much higher in the @xmath3-channel .",
    "however , @xmath109 in both channels at small carrier density .",
    "this result can be easily obtained analytically from ( [ jpar ] ) and ( [ tbkt ] ) .",

    "the relation @xmath109 holds up to higher values of the carrier density in the @xmath3-channel at fixed value of coupling .",
    "it means that the local pairs are bounded tighter in this case .",
    "let us consider a system of coupled layers .",
    "the self - energy , proportional to the inter - layer coupling can be written as @xmath111 where @xmath112 @xmath113 similarly to the 2d case , we assume that the phase of the order parameter changes slowly in the inter - layer direction . therefore , the thermodynamic potential can be calculated up to the second order in @xmath114 : @xmath115 the terms proportional to @xmath116 and @xmath117 are zero due to reflection symmetry in @xmath28-direction .    to map the system on the quasi-2d xy - model with the nearest neighbor interaction we need to obtain @xmath118 this dependence comes from the first term in ( [ omegakinperp ] ) .",
    "the second term in ( [ omegakinperp ] ) is proportional to @xmath119 , what is equivalent to the xy - model with the next nearest neighbor and next next nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "therefore we neglect this term since it is of a higher order ( @xmath120 ) on the inter - layer hopping with respect to the first term ( which is @xmath121 ) . however , if the coupling @xmath5 is not small this term can lead for important physical consequences ( see for example an analysis for the 2d case @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath122 is @xmath123    now we have obtained the kinetic part of the thermodynamic potential @xmath124 in the case of slowly fluctuating phase of the order parameter .",
    "this function is given by ( [ omegakin ] ) , where the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath122 are given by ( [ jpar ] ) and ( [ jperp ] ) .",
    "similarly to ( [ jperp ] ) , an additional integration over @xmath27 must be performed in ( [ jpar ] ) .",
    "the effective action ( [ omegakinperp ] ) was studied in @xcite in the case when the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath122 where considered independent on the fermion hamiltonian parameters .",
    "it was shown @xcite , that there is only one phase transition in such a system at @xmath0 which is bigger than the temperature of the bkt transition in the case of non - coupled layers @xmath125 . in the case of small coupling @xmath126 and",
    "when @xmath5 is increasing to the inter - plane hopping value , @xmath0 is approaching to the value @xmath127 of the fluxon transition , when the inter - layer order starts to take place .",

    "the comparison of the expressions ( [ freeenergy ] ) and ( [ omegakin ] ) , gives the next self - consistent equation for the critical temperature @xmath0 , which follows from ( [ tchorovitz ] ) : @xmath146 where the in - plane correlation length @xmath133 is absorbed in the parameter @xmath122 ( i.e. @xmath147 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath131 actually should be renormalized by including the influence of the inter - layer coupling on the vortex system @xcite .",
    "it is considered here as a model parameter , which should be found experimentally , in particular its doping dependence should be taken into account . for calculation",
    "we use the value @xmath148 ( for estimation of @xmath131 based on an amplitude dependent ginzburg - landau theory , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note , that in the limit of very small carrier densities , when @xmath149 , the analytical solution for @xmath0 can be obtained @xmath150 .",
    "this is different from the one layer case when @xmath151 , independently on the pair angular momentum @xmath94 .",
    "however , the region of extremely low carrier densities is not interesting from physical point of view .    to find the critical temperature @xmath0 one needs to solve the system of equations ( [ gap ] ) , ( [ number ] ) and ( [ tc ] ) with functions @xmath152 and @xmath153 defined in ( [ jpar ] ) and ( [ jperp ] ) .",
    "the numerical solutions show that @xmath154 at small carrier densities in the case of large values of the inter - layer hopping @xmath5 and not very strong coupling @xmath63 ( fig.4 ) .",
    "it means that the dependence of the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 on coupling , carrier density and temperature leads to the non - trivial relation between @xmath0 and the 2d critical temperature @xmath1 at some values of model parameters , different from @xmath155 , as it was predicted for the case of fixed @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in general , @xmath0 is growing with the inter - layer coupling @xmath5 ( figs.4,5 ) .",
    "however , in the case of small carrier density the critical temperature is decreasing with @xmath5 growth when @xmath103 ( fig.4 , in the @xmath107 case this effect takes place at smaller coupling @xmath63 ) .",
    "it can be explained as a consequence of the fact , that the density of states on the fermi level @xmath156 at small carrier densities is decreasing when system tends to become three dimensional with @xmath5 growth ( @xmath157 in the 3d case and @xmath158 in the 2d case ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the role of the term @xmath120 must be studied in addition at rather large values of @xmath5 , when inter - layer hopping becomes of order of the intra - layer hopping , i.e. @xmath159 ( see again @xcite ) .",
    "to summarize , the doping dependence of the superconducting critical temperature of layered superconductors on the charge carrier density has been studied in cases of different angular momentum of the pairs @xmath94 , coupling and inter - layer hopping .",
    "it has been shown that the critical temperature @xmath0 is smaller then the 2d critical temperature @xmath1 at some values of the model parameters , contrary to the xy - model with the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 which do not depend on carrier density @xmath91 , inter - particle coupling @xmath160 and the temperature of the system @xmath161 .",
    "in particular , at small carrier densities @xmath162 , contrary to the dependence of @xmath1 in the 2d case . the critical temperature @xmath0 is growing with @xmath5 , except the case of non - zero angular momentum of the pairs at small carrier densities .    at the same time",
    "some questions are remained unresolved .",
    "in particular , the behavior of the system when the inter - layer coupling @xmath5 is not very small has to be studied and the doping dependence of the vortex condensation energy should be taken into account .",
    "this problems are planned to be studied in the future .",
