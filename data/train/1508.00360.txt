    "the study of extra - galactic jets started with the observations of ngc 4486 ( m87 ) where ` a curious straight ray lies in a sharp gap in the nebulosity  ' , see @xcite .",
    "more recently the analysis of the radio images of extra - galactic jets suggests some interesting problems of physics that should be solved .",
    "one such problem is that of the decrease in the velocity as a function of the distance from the parent nucleus , see @xcite .",
    "various mechanisms have been suggested for the jet s deceleration , we report some of them : an interaction between a relativistic jet and the thermal radiation from an active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , see @xcite ; the incorporation of mass in two - dimensional relativistic jets , see @xcite ; continuous injection of plasma at the base of the jet and dissipation at some distance from the central core , see @xcite ; a rotation - induced rayleigh  taylor type instability , see @xcite ; and the loading of stellar mass produced in elliptical galaxies , see @xcite .",
    "other authors , such as @xcite , quote a terminal velocity of @xmath0 and suggest that the jet s velocity is constant .",
    "a second problem is that of the physical mechanism which bends the jets originating in the the head  tail radio - galaxies , such as , see @xcite , or 1159 + 583 , see @xcite , or 1638 + 538 , see @xcite .",
    "the suggested physical mechanisms for bending are : trajectories in the independent blob model , see @xcite ; an adiabatic model in which the bending is produced by the ram pressure of a central galaxy in uniform motion , see @xcite ; the ram pressure in cluster mergers , see @xcite .",
    "the extragalactic radio - jets are characterized by a radio - luminosity which is expressed in watts and also the flux of kinetic energy is expressed in watts .",
    "the conversion of the flux of kinetic energy in radio - luminosity through a turbulent cascade has became an active field of research , see @xcite .",
    "we now pose the following questions .    *",
    "can the physics of turbulent jets , which are observed in the laboratory , be applied to extra - galactic jets ? *",
    "is it possible to generalize the physics of turbulent jets to a medium with a varying density ?",
    "* can we extend to the relativistic regime the physics of turbulent jets ?",
    "* can we explain the curved trajectories of the extra - galactic jets such as ?",
    "* is it possible to build the image of a curved turbulent jet which is emitting synchrotron radiation ?    in order to answer these questions , we derive the differential equations which model the classical and relativistic momentum conservation for a jet in the presence of three types of medium , see sections [ secclassic ] and [ secrelativistic ] . a model for the composition of a decreasing jet velocity along the @xmath1-axis with constant velocity of the hosting galaxy along the @xmath2-axis",

    "it is clear that in a hot jet characterized by high values of @xmath14 the fraction of the total available energy released firstly in the turbulence and after in non - thermal particles is a small fraction of the bulk flow energy .",
    "the assumption made in the following , in which the bulk flow motion is treated independently from the non - thermal emission , is now justified .",
    "a similar approach can be found in @xcite .",
