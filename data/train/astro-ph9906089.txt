    "thorstensen  ( 1991a ) coined the term `` sw sex stars '' to describe a subset of novalike variables which ( 1 ) were typically eclipsing systems with orbital periods of 34 hrs ; ( 2 ) showed distorted emission line wings ; and ( 3 ) had line - core absorption near phase 0.5 .",

    "thorstensen s ( 1991a ) paper reminded me of ex  hya in outburst ( hellier  1989 ) where high - velocity h@xmath0 wings , crossing from side to side on the orbital cycle , appeared to result from an accretion stream overflowing the initial impact with the disc and re - impacting much further in .",
    "shafter  ( 1986 ) had already suggested something similar for  stars and lubow ( 1989 ) had given theoretical backing to the idea .",
    "accordingly , i observed px  and for 7 orbits with the mcdonald 82@xmath1 telescope  still one of the best sw  sex datasets  and computed the velocities of an overflowing stream to produce synthetic line profiles . by adding emission from the re - impact point ( with a velocity at the mean of the free - fall stream and the local disc velocities ) i obtained a good match to the phasing and velocity of the observed line wings ( hellier &  robinson 1994 ; fig .  1 ) .",
    "subsequent work has produced similar results in v1315  aql ( hellier 1996 ) and ls peg ( taylor , thorstensen &  patterson 1999 ) .    in some stars one has to reduce the model velocity to match the data ( e.g.  to 75%  of freefall in v1315  aql ; hellier 1996 ) .",
    "justification for this has subsequently been provided by hydrodynamical modelling of the stream - disc impact ( armitage &  livio 1998 ) , which shows that after passing through the impact at the disc rim the infalling stream has a range of velocities below freefall .",
    "currently , emission from the stream / disc re - impact appears to be the only viable model for the distorted line wings .",
    "casares  ( 1996 ) have criticised it , claiming to see _ two _ high - velocity components in the wings of v795  her , and have instead invoked magnetic accretion to explain them .",
    "however , it is clear from their data that the two features are split by deep absorption , and are more likely to arise from a single self - absorbed emission component .",
    "the main difficulty with any model in which magnetic channelling dominates the accretion flow is the absence of x - ray emission in these systems .",
    "+ [ 16 mm ]",
    "when i first computed model spectra i included emission from the full length of the stream overflowing the disc .",
    "this produced an emission s - wave in the usual place for a stream / disc impact .",
    "looking at sw  sex star spectra , however , there is no such feature ( e.g.  fig .",
    "1 ) ; indeed there appears to be a reduction in flux along the track of such an s - wave ( max redshift at phase 0.10.2 ; amplitude  400 ) .",
    "i thus computed models with absorption from the free - fall part of the overflowing stream , before the re - impact , ant noticed that it could additionally explain the phase 0.5 absorption .",
    "the first such models ( hellier &  robinson 1994 ) gave absorption at all phases , whereas it is observed predominantly in the phase range 0.20.6 .",
    "hence , i invoked a flared disc , so that most light comes from the rear of the disc in these high - inclination systems .",
    "the effect is that the stream absorbs the bright rear disc at phases around 0.5 , but has little effect when obscuring the near side of the disc . a simulation with a 4  flare in an 82  inclination system is shown in fig .  1",
    "( see also hellier 1998a ) .",
    "i also show the velocity measurements of an absorption - dominated metal line from thorstensen  ( 1991a ) .",
    "there is an excellent match to the phase range and the velocity trend of the absorption .",
    "the velocity amplitude , though , is too large in the model by a factor 3 .",
    "note , though , that ( 1 ) i am using free - fall velocities , whereas the material will have been slowed in the stream / disc bow shock , and ( 2 ) the observed absorption is boxed in by disc and disc - overflow emission , biasing the absorption centroid to the line core .",
    "the @xmath2-velocity of the absorption can not be reliably measured because of the other components in the balmer lines , and because the metal line measured by thorstensen  is a blend of uncertain composition .    in a lower - inclination system",
    "the disc flare will have little effect and the absorption should be seen at all phases . in the non - eclipsing ls  peg ,",
    "taylor  ( 1999 ) see absorption at ( nearly ) all phases in @xmath36678 ( their fig .",
    "10 ) , and compute a tomogram showing absorption in the usual location for a stream / disc impact , both in accordance with the above model .",
    "the alternatives to explaining the absorption by the overflowing stream are to invoke disc bulges ( e.g.  hoard &  szkody 1997 ) or material expelled by a propeller ( horne 1999 ) , but neither idea has yet been developed enough to make a comparison with the data similar to that above .",
    "the most straightforward explanation for single - peaked line profiles , as seen particularly in , is an accretion disc wind ( e.g.   honeycutt  1986 ; dhillon  1991 ) .",
    "such profiles have been computed theoretically by hoare ( 1994 ) . in support of this",
    "i have shown that the peak of the  line of v1315  aql moves with the white dwarf motion ( hellier 1996 ; although note that the  wings also contained a disc - overflow component ) .",
    "the wind component is also present in the balmer lines , filling in any double - peaked disc emission to produce broad , single - peaked profiles .",
    "the presence of a wind is confirmed by p  cygni profiles in the balmer lines of v1315  aql ( hellier 1996 ; fig .",
    "2 ) , which are seen at all phases and appear to move with the orbital motion of the white dwarf .",
    "clear wind signatures in optical lines have also been seen in bz  cam ( patterson  1996 ) .",
    "+ [ 15 mm ]",
    "doppler tomograms of  lines are often brightest in the lower - left quadrant , but at a lower velocity than the trajectory of the stream ( a clear example is fig",
    ".  13 of hoard &  szkody 1997 ; fig .  3 ) .",
    "this discrepancy has been used to argue against the overflow model , and can instead be considered to favour the disc - anchored propeller of horne ( 1999 ) . if material is expelled by a propeller , blobs of different density will collide outside the binary , where they would give line emission at the correct velocity and phase to explain the tomogram .",
    "this reasoning , though , assumes that the brightening in the tomogram can be taken at face value .",
    "the emission from the overflowing stream will have a large velocity dispersion and a mean velocity well below free - fall ( see armitage &  livio 1998 ) . as pointed out by hellier &   robinson ( 1994 ) and hellier ( 1996 )",
    ", the brightest region of the tomogram will occur in the lower - left quadrant where the stream component overlaps with the ring of emission from the disc , _ but this brightening is not a component in its own right . _",
    "the emission in the upper - left quadrant is reduced by the absorption discussed above .",
    "one can see this effect directly in the trailed spectra ( e.g.  fig .  1 ) .",
    "the high - velocity overflow component zigzags across the disc double peaks , causing bright regions where they overlap ( phases 0.35 and 0.85 ) .",
    "( the crossings at phases 0.1 and 0.6 are reduced by absorption along the track of the usual s - wave . ) the relevant region in the tomogram ( corresponding to the sinusoidal track from + 300  at phase 0.85 to 300  at 0.35 ) is bright because it links these regions _ but there is no discernable component moving along this track . _",
    "the same effect is seen in all  spectra with enough s / n to separate components . if the emission were from colliding blobs outside the binary , as in the propeller model , it would be visible at all phases and so would produce a continuous s - wave along the track ; thus the trailed spectra do not support the propeller interpretation .",
    "the eclipse profiles of the  stars do not follow the theoretical expectation for a novalike disc .",
    "the eclipse bottoms are v - shaped , rather then u - shaped , and when mapped onto a disc produce an inner disc cooler than expected ( rutten  1992 ) . however ,",
    "if the above ideas are correct , interpreting the eclipse using a flat disc will be inappropriate .",
    "instead , one would have to account for ( 1 ) a disc flare ; ( 2 ) an overflowing , vertically extended stream ( which might be brighter or darker than the novalike disc ) ; and ( 3 ) a wind removing energy from the inner disc .",
    "no study has yet included all these factors .",
    "a pointer can , however , be gained from recent observations of the intermediate polar ex  hya in outburst .",
    "these outbursts seem to be mass - transfer events in which an enhanced stream overflows the accretion disc ( hellier  1999 ) .",
    "they give us a chance to see an overflowing stream against a faint low - state disc .",
    "the observed eclipse profiles are asymmetric v - shapes , with rapid ingress and slower egress , and they have minima late by 0.02 in phase ( compared to inferior conjunction of the secondary ) .",
    "these features are all reproduced by a model eclipse of a bright stream ( hellier  1999 ; fig .",
    "the same characteristics can be seen in the eclipse of  ( fig .  1 of rutten  1992 ) , although bear in mind that in  the stream eclipse is convolved with that of a bright high - state disc .     + [ 28 mm ]",
    "the  lines are eclipsed to the same extent as the continuum but the balmer lines are only partially eclipsed , so that their equivalent widths increase during eclipse ( e.g.  dhillon  1991 ) .",
    "this is explained if  consists of wind emission from near the white dwarf where it is deeply eclipsed , and if the balmer lines contain a wind component from higher up , where it escapes eclipse .",
    "the models by hoare ( 1994 ) , however , predict the opposite , with balmer emission emerging from closer to the white dwarf .",
    "thus either the wind models are over - simplifed ( e.g.  no clumpiness ) or a different idea is needed .",
    "the other evidence for winds ( e.g.  the p cygni profiles ) suggests the former .",
    "i have shown above that the main  characteristics  distorted line wings , distorted eclipses , phase 0.5 absorption  can be explained if the accretion stream overflows the disc in these stars .",
    "the model , though , is still an outline and needs further development , such as the derivation of line profiles from the hydrodynamical modelling of armitage &  livio ( 1998 ) .",
    "stream / disc overflow seems to be more widespread than just  stars . for example , the x - ray beat - period pulsations in many intermediate polars are probably caused by overflow ( e.g.  hellier 1991 , with recent reviews by buckley , this volume , and hellier 1998b ) .",
    "of particular note is fo  aqr , which shows an x - ray beat period and also an absorption s - wave from an overflowing stream ( hellier  1990 ) , reminiscent of  absorption .",
    "such x - ray beat periods are variable and sometimes absent [ pointed out by hellier ( 1991 ) , but now best shown by wheatley s ( 1999 ) dataset on tx  col . ]",
    "the implication of fluctuating overflow probably applies to  stars as well .",
    "for instance ,  itself has sometimes appeared much less sw  sexy than normal ( dhillon  1997 ) .",
    "further , we d expect there to be novalikes very similar to  stars , but with little or no overflow occurring .",
    "bp  lyn and uu  aqr ( hoard &  szkody 1996 ; hoard  1998 ) seem to be such stars , with ( in my judgement ) insufficient phase 0.5 absorption and/or high - velocity s - wave to qualify as fully fledged  stars ( although there is unlikely to be a clean divide ) .",
    "so why does overflow appear preferentially amongst a group of novalikes with 34 hr periods ?",
    "this is counter to expectations since theoretically it should be easier to overflow a cool low - state disc than a high - state novalike disc ( e.g.  hessman 1999 ) , yet overflow has not been reported in quiescent dwarf novae .",
    "the presence in  stars of both overflow and winds , and their tendancy to show superhumps , is circumstantial evidence for very high mass - transfer rates .",
    "further ,  stars occur in the same period range as stars showing vy  scl low states , and in a range containing few dwarf novae ( e.g.  shafter 1992 ) .",
    "thus something appears to inhibit mass transfer at medium rates .",
    "several mechanism have been proposed to explain this , including star spots ( livio &  pringle 1994 ) and irradiation of the secondary star ( wu  1995 ; king  1996 ) .",
    "thus if irradiation in a high-@xmath4 novalike leads to even more mass transfer , it can drive the novalike into an  state ( any similar mechanism by which mass transfer feeds back into enhanced mass transfer would also suffice ) .",
    "when the feedback cycle breaks ( perhaps through the intervention of star spots or through sheilding by the accretion disc ) the system plunges into a vy  scl low state .",
    "this mechanism would occur preferentially just above the gap , since the orbital separation is less than in other novalikes , hence explaining the period distribution of  and vy  scl stars ."
