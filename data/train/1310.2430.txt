    "synchronization of neuronal spiking in the brain is related to cognitive functions , such as perception , attention , and memory .",
    "it is therefore important to determine which properties of neurons influence their collective behavior in a network and to understand how .",
    "a prominent feature of many cortical neurons is spike frequency adaptation , which is caused by slow transmembrane currents .",
    "we investigated how these adaptation currents affect the synchronization tendency of coupled model neurons . using the efficient adaptive exponential integrate - and - fire ( aeif ) model and a biophysically detailed neuron model for validation",
    ", we found that increased adaptation currents promote synchronization of coupled excitatory neurons at lower spike frequencies , as long as the conduction delays between the neurons are negligible .",
    "inhibitory neurons on the other hand synchronize in presence of conduction delays , with or without adaptation currents .",
    "our results emphasize the utility of the aeif model for computational studies of neuronal network dynamics .",
    "we conclude that adaptation currents provide a mechanism to generate low frequency oscillations in local populations of excitatory neurons , while faster rhythms seem to be caused by inhibition rather than excitation .",
    "synchronized oscillating neural activity has been shown to be involved in a variety of cognitive functions @xcite such as multisensory integration @xcite , conscious perception @xcite , selective attention @xcite and memory @xcite , as well as in pathological states including parkinson s disease @xcite , schizophrenia @xcite , and epilepsy @xcite .",
    "these observations have led to a great interest in understanding the mechanisms of neuronal synchronization , how synchronous oscillations are initiated , maintained , and destabilized .",
    "the phase response curve ( prc ) provides a powerful tool to study neuronal synchronization @xcite .",
    "the prc is an experimentally obtainable measure that characterizes the effects of transient inputs to a periodically spiking neuron on the timing of its subsequent spike .",
    "prc based techniques have been applied widely to analyze rhythms of neuronal populations and have yielded valuable insights into , for example , motor pattern generation @xcite , the hippocampal theta rhythm @xcite , and memory retrieval @xcite .",
    "the shape of the prc is strongly affected by ionic currents that mediate spike frequency adaptation ( sfa ) @xcite , a prominent feature of neuronal dynamics shown by a decrease in instantaneous spike rate during a sustained current injection @xcite .",
    "these adaptation currents modify the prc in distinct ways , depending on whether they operate near rest or during the spike @xcite . using biophysical neuron models",
    ", it has been shown that a low threshold outward current , such as the muscarinic voltage - dependent @xmath0-current ( @xmath1 ) , can produce a prc , characterized by phase advances and delays in response to excitatory stimuli , in contrast to only phase advances , defining a prc . a high threshold outward current on the other hand , such as the @xmath2-dependent afterhyperpolarization @xmath0-current ( @xmath3 ) , flattens the prc at early phases and skews its peak towards the end of the period @xcite .",
    "both changes of the prc indicate an increased propensity for synchronization of coupled excitatory cells @xcite , and can be controlled selectively through cholinergic neuromodulation .",
    "in particular , @xmath1 and @xmath3 are reduced by acetylcholine with different sensitivities , which modifies the prc shape @xcite .    in recent years",
    "substantial efforts have been exerted to develop single neuron models of reduced complexity that can reproduce a large repertoire of observed neuronal behavior , while being computationally less demanding and , more importantly , easier to understand and analyze than detailed biophysical models .",
    "two - dimensional variants of the leaky integrate - and - fire neuron model have been proposed which take into consideration an adaptation mechanism that is spike triggered @xcite or subthreshold , capturing resonance properties @xcite , as well as an improved description of spike initiation by an exponential term @xcite .",
    "a popular example is the adaptive exponential leaky integrate - and - fire ( aeif ) model by brette and gerstner @xcite .",
    "the aeif model is similar to the two - variable model of izhikevich @xcite , such that both models include a sub - threshold as well as a spike - triggered adaptation component in one adaptation current .",
    "the advantages of the aeif model , as opposed to the izhikevich model , are the exponential description of spike initiation instead of a quadratic nonlinearity , and more importantly , that its parameters are of physiological relevance . despite their simplicity , these two models ( aeif and izhikevich ) can capture a broad range of neuronal dynamics @xcite which renders them appropriate for application in large - scale network models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the aeif model has been successfully fit to hodgkin - huxley - type neurons as well as to recordings from cortical neurons @xcite . since lately , this model is also implemented in neuromorphic hardware systems @xcite .    because of subthreshold and spike - triggered contributions to the adaptation current",
    ", the aeif model exhibits a rich dynamical structure @xcite , and can be tuned to reproduce the behavior of all major classes of neurons , as defined electrophysiologically in vitro @xcite . here",
    ", we use the aeif model to study the influence of adaptation on network dynamics , particularly synchronization and phase locking , taking into account conduction delays and unequal synaptic strengths .",
    "first , we show how both subthreshold and spike - triggered adaptation affect the prc as a function of spike frequency .",
    "then , we apply phase reduction theory , assuming weak coupling , to explain how the changes in phase response behavior determine phase locking of neuronal pairs , considering conduction delays and heterogeneous synaptic strengths . we next present numerical simulations of networks which support the findings from our analysis of phase locking in neuronal pairs , and show their robustness against heterogeneities . finally , to validate the biophysical implication of the adaptation parameters in the aeif model , we relate and compare the results using this model to the effects of @xmath1 and @xmath3 on synchronization in hodgkin - huxley - type conductance based neurons",
    "thereby , we demonstrate that the basic description of an adaptation current in the low - dimensional aeif model suffices to capture the characteristic changes of prcs , and consequently the effects on phase locking and network behavior , mediated by biophysical adaptation currents in a complex neuron model .",
    "the aeif model thus represents a useful and efficient tool to examine the dynamical behavior of neuronal networks .",
    "the aeif model consists of two differential equations and a reset condition , @xmath4 @xmath5 the first equation is the membrane equation , where the capacitive current through the membrane with capacitance @xmath6 equals the sum of ionic currents , the adaptation current @xmath7 , and the input current @xmath8 .",
    "the ionic currents are given by an ohmic leak current , determined by the leak conductance @xmath9 and the leak reversal potential @xmath10 , and a @xmath11-current which is responsible for the generation of spikes .",
    "the @xmath11-current is approximated by the exponential term , where @xmath12 is the threshold slope factor and @xmath13 is the threshold potential , assuming that the activation of @xmath14-channels is instantaneous and neglecting their inactivation @xcite .",
    "the membrane time constant is @xmath15 .",
    "when @xmath8 drives the membrane potential @xmath16 beyond @xmath13 , the exponential term actuates a positive feedback and leads to a spike , which is said to occur at the time when @xmath16 diverges towards infinity . in practice , integration of the model equations is stopped when @xmath16 reaches a finite `` cutoff '' value @xmath17 , and @xmath16 is reset to @xmath18 .",
    "equation governs the dynamics of @xmath7 , with the adaptation time constant @xmath19 . @xmath20",
    "quantifies a conductance that mediates subthreshold adaptation .",
    "spike - triggered adaptation is included through the increment @xmath21 .",
    "the dynamics of the model relevant to our study is outlined as follows .",
    "when the input current @xmath8 to the neuron at rest is slowly increased , at some critical current the resting state is destabilized which leads to repetitive spiking for large regions in parameter space @xcite .",
    "this onset of spiking corresponds to a saddle - node ( sn ) bifurcation if @xmath22 , and a subcritical andronov - hopf ( ah ) bifurcation if @xmath23 at current values @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively which can be calculated explicitly @xcite . in the former case a stable fixed point ( the neuronal resting state ) and an unstable fixed point ( the saddle ) merge and disappear , in the latter case the stable fixed point becomes unstable before merging with the saddle . in the limiting case @xmath26 , both bifurcations ( sn and ah ) meet and the system undergoes a bogdanov - takens ( bt ) bifurcation .",
    "the sets of points with @xmath27 and @xmath28 are called @xmath16-nullcline and @xmath7-nullcline , respectively .",
    "it is obvious that all fixed points in the two - dimensional state space can be identified as intersections of these two nullclines .",
    "spiking can occur at a constant input current lower than @xmath24 or @xmath25 depending on whether the sequence of reset points lies exterior to the basin of attraction of the stable fixed point .",
    "this means , the system just below the bifurcation current can be bistable ; periodic spiking and constant membrane potential are possible at the same input current .",
    "thus , periodic spiking trajectories do not necessarily emerge from a sn or ah bifurcation .",
    "we determined the lowest input current that produces repetitive spiking ( the rheobase current , @xmath29 ) numerically by delivering long - lasting rectangular current pulses to the model neurons at rest .",
    "note that in general @xmath29 depends on @xmath18 , such that in case of bistability , @xmath29 can be reduced by decreasing @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we selected realistic values for the model parameters ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) and varied the adaptation parameters within reasonable ranges ( @xmath37~\\mathrm{\\mu s}$ ] , @xmath38~\\mathrm{na}$ ] ) .",
    "all model parametrizations in this study lead to periodic spiking for sufficiently large @xmath8 , possibly including transient adaptation .",

    "we have further demonstrated that heterogeneity in synaptic strengths desynchronizes excitatory and inhibitory pairs and leads to phase locking with a small phase difference in case of prcs and small delays . while neurons with prcs have stable phase locked states even for large differences in synaptic strengths , pairs of coupled neurons with prcs",

    "this provides support to the hypothesis that inhibitory networks play an essential role in generating coherent brain rhythms , as has been proposed earlier @xcite , @xcite for review .",
    "inhibition rather than excitation has been found to generate neuronal synchrony particularly in case of slow synaptic rise and decay @xcite , and in the presence of conduction delays as has recently been shown experimentally @xcite . in regimes that lead to bistability of in - phase and anti - phase locking according to our analysis of pairs ,",
    "the simulated networks break up into two clusters of synchronized neurons .",
    "recently it has been shown that a stable two cluster state of pulse coupled neural oscillators can exist even when synchrony of individual pairs is unstable @xcite .",
    "such cluster states have been invoked to explain population rhythms measured in vitro , where the involved neurons spike at about half of the population frequency @xcite . + spike frequency has been shown to affect the skewness of prcs , using integrate - and - fire neurons with adaptation @xcite , and to modulate the negative lobe in prcs of conductance based model neurons @xcite . using the aeif model we have demonstrated that the spike frequency strongly attenuates the effect of either adaptation mechanism on the prc . at high frequency , unphysiologically large adaptation parameter values are necessary to produce a negative lobe or a significant right - skew in the prc .",
    "this means , for a given degree of adaptation in excitatory neurons , synchronization is possible at frequencies up to a certain value .",
    "the stronger the adaptation , the larger this upper frequency limit .",
    "it has been previously suggested that the degree of adaptation can determine a preferred frequency range for synchronization of excitatory neurons , based on the observation ( in vitro and in silico ) that the neurons tend to spike in phase with injected currents oscillating at certain frequencies @xcite .",
    "this preferred oscillation frequency increases with increasing degree of sfa .",
    "according to our results , at low frequencies synchronization of local circuits through excitatory synapses is possible , provided that the neurons are adapting and delays are short . at higher frequencies ,",
    "adaptation much less affects the synchronization tendency of excitatory neurons and inhibition may play the dominant role in generating coherent rhythms @xcite .",
    "+ the adaptation currents @xmath1 and @xmath3 have previously been found to influence the phase response characteristics of the biophysical traub neuron model , turning a prc to ( through @xmath1 ) and modulating its skew ( through @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "we have shown that these changes of the prc are reflected in the aeif model by its two adaptation parameters and that in both models ( aeif and traub ) these changes are modulated by the spike frequency .",
    "as a consequence , the adaptation induced effects on synchronization of pairs and networks of oscillating neurons are qualitatively similar in both models .",
    "quantitative differences with respect to these effects may well be reduced by fitting the aeif model parameters to traub neuron features . + our analysis of phase locked states",
    "is based on the assumption that synaptic interactions are weak .",

    "<S> the ability of spiking neurons to synchronize their activity in a network depends on the response behavior of these neurons as quantified by the phase response curve ( prc ) and on coupling properties . </S>",

    "<S> here we use the adaptive exponential integrate - and - fire ( aeif ) neuron model to determine how subthreshold and spike - triggered slow adaptation currents shape the prc . based on that , </S>",
    "<S> we predict how synchrony and phase locked states of coupled neurons change in presence of synaptic delays and unequal coupling strengths . </S>",
    "<S> we find that increased subthreshold adaptation currents cause a transition of the prc from only phase advances to phase advances and delays in response to excitatory perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> increased spike - triggered adaptation currents on the other hand predominantly skew the prc to the right . </S>",
    "<S> both adaptation induced changes of the prc are modulated by spike frequency , being more prominent at lower frequencies . applying phase reduction theory , </S>",
    "<S> we show that subthreshold adaptation stabilizes synchrony for pairs of coupled excitatory neurons , while spike - triggered adaptation causes locking with a small phase difference , as long as synaptic heterogeneities are negligible . for inhibitory pairs synchrony </S>",

    "<S> we further demonstrate that stable synchrony and bistable in / anti - phase locking of pairs carry over to synchronization and clustering of larger networks . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of adaptation in aeif neurons on prcs and network dynamics qualitatively reflect those of biophysical adaptation currents in detailed hodgkin - huxley - based neurons , which underscores the utility of the aeif model for investigating the dynamical behavior of networks . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest neuronal spike frequency adaptation as a mechanism synchronizing low frequency oscillations in local excitatory networks , but indicate that inhibition rather than excitation generates coherent rhythms at higher frequencies . </S>"
