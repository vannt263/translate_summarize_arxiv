    "the leading twist formalism based on the collinear factorization @xcite has been proved widely successful in a variety of processes in qcd .",
    "the collinear factorization allows for the separation of the short and long distance contributions in the processes which involve hadrons .",
    "the short distance part is the partonic cross section , which can be systematically calculated order by order in the strong coupling within the perturbation theory .",
    "the long distance parts are parton distribution and fragmentation functions which contain all the non - perturbative information .",
    "thanks to the factorization theorem these quantities are universal and once determined in one process can be taken over to the other process to determine the corresponding cross section .",
    "these standard parton distribution functions are often referred as the integrated parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) since they depend only on the fraction of the longitudinal momentum @xmath0 and the hard scale @xmath1 .",
    "problems arise when one tries to address more exclusive processes with final states .",
    "then , the details of the kinematics are essential and standard kinematic approximation can be insufficient for these purposes .",
    "this is where the formalism with the parton distributions unintegrated over the other components of the momenta is necessary .",
    "one also needs to prove more general factorization theorems which incorporate these unintegrated parton distribution / fragmentation functions .    to start with ,",
    "let us first recall the standard definition of the integrated quark parton density : @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is the quark field and @xmath4 is the proton state in which the operator above is evaluated .",
    "subscript @xmath5 means that we are considering renormalized operator and @xmath1 is the renormalization scale .",
    "the object inserted between the quark fields is the wilson line @xmath6 in the lightlike direction @xmath7 .",
    "this ensures the gauge invariance and can be shown to arise from graphs with arbitrarily many gluon exchanges which appropriately factorize into this path - ordered exponential .    to illustrate some issues related with the kinematical approximations used in the standard collinear approach",
    "let us consider the parton model of the deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the lowest order graph is pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : pm ] and we can write down formally its contribution to the hadronic tensor as @xmath8 \\ ; ,   \\label{eq : hadtensor}\\ ] ] with the sum over @xmath9 as a sum over the quark flavors .",
    "[ fig : pm ]    the kinematic approximations needed to obtain the factorized form set the quarks on - shell and massless @xmath10 these approximations give the familiar expression for the hadronic tensor @xmath11 \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : hadtensorfacrorized}\\ ] ] the expression in the curly brackets corresponds to the parton density and the expression with the trace is the partonic cross section .",
    "note , that the approximations are good when the momentum components @xmath12 and @xmath13 are small with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "this is sufficient when the momenta are integrated over in the inclusive cross section but might lead to large errors when we look at some more exclusive processes .",
    "indeed the parton model approximation makes the following replacement @xmath15 these two delta functions can lead to similar results when integrated over all momenta ( inclusive processes ) but can lead to very different results in the exclusive cases .",
    "if we allow for the invariant mass of the outgoing parton @xmath16 we see that the parton model value @xmath17 becomes significantly modified @xmath18 as shown in @xcite on the example of the @xmath19 production in dis there are huge differences between standard parton model , unintegrated partons and exact kinematics .",
    "in particular the @xmath20 distributions of the produced charmed quarks depend heavily whether integrated or unintegrated formalism is used .",
    "the general conclusion @xcite is that conventional formalism with integrated parton densities is not suitable for the analysis of the final states . in the next sections we discuss the general factorization framework which makes use of the unintegrated parton correlation functions .",
    "all the details , including the derivation of the factorization and the definitions of the unintegrated parton correlation functions can be found in @xcite .",
    "we have learned from the discussion in the introduction that the description of the exclusive processes requires a new formalism with new parton densities and fragmentation functions .",
    "we distinguish three types of objects :    * conventional integrated parton distributions and fragmentation functions .",
    "these depend on the fraction of the longitudinal momentum and the scale @xmath21 * unintegrated parton distribution functions ( and ffs ) which depend on the transverse momentum @xmath22 * fully unintegrated parton correlation functions which depend on all components of the momenta : longitudinal , transverse , and virtuality @xmath23    the unintegrated ( over @xmath12 ) parton distribution functions have been introduced in the context of small @xmath0 physics , ( see for example @xcite ) . there , as a result of the high - energy approximation , the 4-point gluon green s function emerges as a fundamental object .",
    "it depends on the transverse momenta of 4-off shell gluons . its evolution with rapidity",
    "is then governed by the bfkl equation .",
    "there have been numerous efforts @xcite to construct the unintegrated parton densities outside the small @xmath0 limit , many of them using the angular ordered ccfm equation .",
    "however , theses approaches do not provide with the operator definitions of the unintegrated parton distribution functions . therefore , it is desirable to have a unique and consistent approach which demonstrates factorization using the properly defined unintegrated parton correlation functions",
    ". then , hopefully , different approaches developed so far will be reproduced as a particular limit or approximation to a more general case .",
    "the general formalism for use in the case of the deep inelastic scattering introduced in detail in @xcite .",
    "the main points are    * retain the exact kinematics in initial and final states . *",
    "keep the explicit factors ( bubbles ) representing final states . *",
    "retain on - shell matrix elements . * define projections from exact to approximate momenta .",
    "* construct definitions of the gauge invariant parton correlation factors and the soft factor . * use eikonal lines and ward identities to prove factorization . * use non - light - like eikonal wilson lines to regularize light - cone divergences in the unintegrated parton distributions ( this introduces a cutoff in rapidity , similarly to what is done at small x ) .",
    "[ fig : gengraph ]    one starts with the most general graph in the case of the deep inelastic scattering which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gengraph ] .",
    "this graphs differs from the ordinary parton model due to several distinctive features .",
    "first of all , the final state quark has a jet subgraph .",
    "this is a minimal required assumption since we know that the quark has to hadronize .",
    "a second important point is that we need to allow for the non - perturbative ( or soft ) interactions between the outgoing jet and the target remnant .",
    "these are obviously necessary to neutralize the color .",
    "therefore we need to allow for arbitrarily many gluon connections between the soft bubble and the target and jet subgraphs .",
    "so graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : gengraph ] constitutes a necessary extension to a simple parton model .",
    "[ fig : gengraphfact ]    in order to prove the factorization one needs first to identify all the leading regions : collinear to jet , collinear to the target and soft . on also needs to perform subtractions to ensure that the smaller regions are appropriately suppressed .",
    "then the ward identities are used to disentangle the gluons between the different subgraphs ( for example collinear to soft subgraphs ) . in particular",
    "one has to prove that the ward identities work properly in the presence of the subtractions .",
    "after the application of ward identities the gluons factorize into the wilson lines in the appropriate objects .",
    "the final factorization formula proven in @xcite reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 denote the soft factor , parton distribution , jet factor and hard scattering cross section respectively .",
    "@xmath26 denotes the projection onto the apropriate structure function .",
    "all the non - perturbative factors depend on the all components of the 4-momenta @xmath27 .",
    "note the appearance of the rapidity variables @xmath28 .",
    "these are necessary to suppress the contributions from the regions where the rapidities are very large ( rapidity divergencies ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated that this can be regularized by changing the direction of the wilson lines from the light - like directions to slightly non - light - like @xcite .",
    "the parton distribution , fragmentation functions and soft factors acquire then additional parameters .",
    "appropriate evolution equations give the prescription on the variation of these quantities with the rapidity . the final factorized graph is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gengraphfact ] where by double lines we denote the wilson lines .",
    "the analysis of the single gluon attachment allows to construct the gauge invariant definitions of the parton correlation functions ( pcfs ) and the soft factor . as already discussed in a previous section critical to these",
    "are the directions of the wilson lines .",
    "soft gluons couple to the target jet , with its large plus component of momentum , and to the outgoing jet with its large minus component of momentum .",
    "this means that in coordinate space the soft factor is the vacuum expectation value of wilson lines that are nearly light - like in the plus and minus directions @xcite    @xmath29    note that we have replaced in this expression the light - like wilson lines with the non - light - like ones in the directions denoted by the vectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 . as mentioned above",
    ", the reason for their presence is that they provide cutoffs on rapidity divergences .",
    "the factors @xmath34 are the transverse links at infinity which are needed to ensure strict gauge invariance @xcite . with",
    "these included , the soft factor ( [ softdef ] ) is the expectation value of the closed wilson loop .",
    "the target pcf is defined as the gauge invariant expectation value of two quark fields .",
    "its definition reads @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a reference point in space - time .",
    "the two quark fields are connected via three wilson lines , two of them going into the direction @xmath37 which corresponds to the rapidity close to zero in the center - of - mass system .",
    "this expectation value is divided by the soft factor , in order to ensure the proper cancellation of the double counting contributions .",
    "note that the soft factor has now @xmath38 replaced by the @xmath39 vector .",
    "this guarantees that the definition ( [ pcf2 ] ) gives a good approximation for the gluons close to the target region .",
    "similar definition can be constructed for the jet factor with vector @xmath40 replaced by @xmath38    @xmath41",
