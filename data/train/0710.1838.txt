    "warped extra dimensions provide a novel framework in which to explore physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , offering natural solutions to many outstanding puzzles in particle physics .",
    "of course the most well - known achievement is the geometrical solution to the hierarchy problem @xcite , realized by separating gravity from the higgs boson in the fifth dimension . by extending the sm fields into the bulk ,",
    "it is possible to naturally generate yukawa hierarchies , suppress flavor - changing - neutral - currents ( fcnc ) , achieve gauge coupling unification , and construct realistic models of electroweak symmetry breaking with kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations within reach of the lhc @xcite .",
    "although the notion of a curved higher - dimensional spacetime may seem speculative , the utility of this framework is undeniable in light of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , according to which these five - dimensional ( 5d ) theories are dual to purely four - dimensional ( 4d ) strongly coupled gauge theories .",
    "typically in such theories , perturbative approaches are futile due to the strong coupling , and hence important observables are difficult to calculate . since the 5d theory is weakly coupled , the warped dimension can be viewed as a calculational tool for the 4d strongly coupled theory .",
    "theories in a slice of anti - de sitter ( ads ) space have an especially rich holographic interpretation @xcite .",
    "the existence of an infrared ( ir ) brane in 5d translates to a spontaneous breakdown of conformal symmetry in 4d .",
    "accordingly , bound states built out of fundamental conformal field theory ( cft ) fields appear .",
    "these composites are the `` holograms '' of the kk modes .",
    "an ultraviolet ( uv ) brane corresponds to adding an elementary degree of freedom , the `` source '' field , to the 4d theory which mixes with the composites .",
    "hence , the true mass eigenstates of the theory contain some admixture of elementary ( source ) and composite ( cft ) degrees of freedom .",
    "recently we proposed a new tool , the _ holographic basis _",
    "@xcite , which can be used to quantify the mixing between the elementary and composite sectors .",
    "rather than perform a kaluza - klein decomposition , we expand the bulk field directly in terms of purely source field and purely composite resonances .",
    "the effective theory contains contains in general both kinetic and mass mixing between the two sectors .",
    "it is straightforward to transform from the holographic basis to the kk basis , and this transformation tells us the precise elementary / composite content of the physical degrees of freedom in the 4d dual theory",
    "@xcite analyzed only bosonic fields .",
    "in this paper , we formulate the holographic basis for bulk fermions in a slice of ads@xmath0 .",
    "the holographic interpretation of warped fermions was given in ref .",
    "one particularly striking aspect of the dual theory is that , in certain cases depending on the bulk fermion mass , an additional elementary degree of freedom marries with the source field via a mass mixing , while simultaneously the cft produces an exponentially light mode .",
    "we will confirm this result explicitly with our formalism .",
    "as one of the main applications of the holographic basis , we compute the elementary / composite content of sm fermions in realistic warped models . in particular , we show the ir localized right - handed top quark is approximately a @xmath1 elementary - composite admixture .",
    "many aspects of the so - called holographic procedure ( associating a cft operator with a bulk field , constructing a boundary effective action , etc . ) can seem mysterious , especially when compared with the more standard kaluza - klein method of analyzing 5d theories . in this regard , using the holographic basis is more in line with the standard approach in that we decompose the field in terms of a complete set of states and compactify the theory .",
    "since these tools are familiar , we hope the holographic basis will allow for a more accessible ( and quantitative ) approach to understanding holography .    to this end , we use the holographic basis to recast several important aspects of warped phenomenology into the language of strongly coupled composites mixing with an elementary sector .",
    "specifically , we consider the holographic interpretations of the yukawa hierarchies , randall - sundrum gim mechanism , and the custodial protection in electroweak precision tests @xcite , which become quite transparent with the help of the holographic basis .",
    "a phenomenological approach to partial compositeness has also been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we begin in section 2 by reviewing fermions in warped space and their holographic interpretation .",
    "the holographic basis for fermions is proposed in section 3 , where we specify the bulk profiles of the elementary and composite states , set up the general eigenvalue problem , and outline how to transform to the mass eigenbasis . in section 4",
    ", we use the holographic basis to compute the elementary / composite content of sm fermions in warped models .",
    "section 5 is devoted to understanding the holographic picture of several robust features of bulk rs models .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "we set the stage for the holographic basis by recalling aspects of bulk fermions in a slice of ads@xmath0 @xcite and their holographic interpretation @xcite .",
    "the metric describing 5d anti - de sitter space is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the ads@xmath0 curvature scale .",
    "the interval ranges from @xmath4 to @xmath5 where there exists a uv and ir brane , respectively .",
    "we denote 5d indices with latin letters ( @xmath6 ) and 4d indices with greek letters ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we use the flat metric @xmath8 to raise and lower 4d indices .",
    "the action for a dirac fermion @xmath9 propagating in the bulk is @xmath10 , \\label{a1}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the vielbein , @xmath12 is the covariant derivative .",
    "the spin connection pieces @xmath13 cancel in ( [ a1 ] ) . defining @xmath14 , and",
    "the two - component spinors @xmath15 , we can write the action as @xmath16 . \\label{a2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    special attention must be paid to boundary terms that arise when varying the action .",
    "usually when dealing with 5d theories , one of the fields @xmath17 or @xmath18 is taken to have a dirichlet condition at the boundaries , guaranteeing that all boundary terms vanish and allowing integration by parts freely .",
    "but if more general boundary conditions are applied to @xmath19 , as occurs when using the holographic procedure @xcite , the variational principle is not satisfied due to nonvanishing boundary terms . as we will see in sec .",
    "the profiles defining the holographic basis satisfy nontrivial boundary conditions , and therefore generic boundary terms will not vanish . to satisfy the variational principle with the holographic basis , we will require an additional boundary term : @xmath20\\bigg\\vert_0^{\\pi r } , \\label{boundary}\\ ] ] which upon variation , cancels the boundary terms arising from the bulk action .",
    "the total action @xmath21 satisfies the variational principle .",
    "note that the additional term ( [ boundary ] ) automatically vanishes if one of the fields satisfies the typical dirichlet condition .",
    "finally we integrate the second and sixth terms in ( [ a2 ] ) by parts to write the total action as @xmath22 . \\label{a3}\\ ] ] again , when we work in the holographic basis , the boundary terms that arise in the integration by parts are canceled by ( [ boundary ] ) .",
    "this will be our starting point for analyzing the elementary / composite mixing in the holographic basis .",
    "the traditional method of analyzing 5d theories is to perform a kaluza - klein decomposition .",
    "we expand the 5d fields @xmath23 in a complete set of states @xmath24 where the eigenfunctions satisfy the equations of motion @xmath25f^n_\\pm(y)=\\pm m_n e^{k y}f^n_\\mp(y ) , \\label{eom1}\\ ] ] and the orthonormal condition @xmath26 we will be interested in the case where a massless chiral mode exists in the theory . without loss of generality , we will take @xmath27 to have a zero mode .",
    "the boundary conditions allowing the existence of a zero mode @xmath28 , with @xmath29 projected out , are @xmath30 the normalized zero mode wavefunction is given by @xmath31 the mass eigenvalues are determined by applying boundary conditions ( [ kkbc1 ] ) and ( [ kkbc2 ] ) to the solutions of ( [ eom1 ] ) , which yields the equation determining the spectrum : @xmath32 explicitly , the spectrum contains a chiral zero mode @xmath33 and a tower of dirac fermions @xmath34 with mass @xmath35 .",
    "the kaluza - klein basis is , by construction , diagonal in field space , with no quadratic mixing in the effective lagrangian , and is therefore the physical mass eigenbasis .",
    "in contrast , we will see in the holographic basis that there is quadratic mixing between an elementary sector and a set of composite resonances .",
    "the physical states therefore contain a mixture of elementary and composite states .",
    "we elaborate on this next with a discussion of the ads / cft inspired holographic interpretation of bulk fermions .",
    "the theory of bulk fermions in a slice of ads@xmath0 can be given a holographic interpretation @xcite , in which the physical states of the theory contain a mixture of elementary and composite states .",
    "ultimately our goal is to quantify this mixing , which we will do in the next section .",
    "here we focus on several main results of @xcite which will provide motivation for the holographic basis .    to implement the holographic procedure , we must first specify which bulk field @xmath23 will correspond to the elementary `` source '' field in the dual theory .",
    "we are interested in the holographic dual of the theory with a chiral zero mode described in section 2.1 , so clearly we should choose @xmath17 as our source field , with arbitrary uv boundary value @xmath36 .",
    "then by the ads / cft correspondence , there is a corresponding cft operator @xmath37 which is sourced by @xmath36 in the 4d generating functional of the dual theory .",
    "we can compute the two - point correlator which is contained in the self - energy @xmath38 @xcite : @xmath39 the poles in the correlator , which are the zeros of the function in the denominator , correspond to the diagonal masses @xmath40 ( distinct from the physical masses @xmath35 ) of the composite cft states : @xmath41 notice that this mass spectrum would arise if we changed the boundary conditions in ( [ kkbc1 ] ) and ( [ kkbc2 ] ) from neumann to dirichlet at the uv boundary for @xmath27 , and vice - versa for @xmath42",
    ". this observation will be crucial in defining the holographic basis .",
    "the self - energy @xmath38 also gives us information about the nature of the elementary source field .",
    "for @xmath43 , the source is chiral since no massless pole appears in either the high or low momentum expansion of @xmath38 .",
    "however , for @xmath44 , the high - energy expansion yields @xmath45 . \\label{sigpole}\\ ] ] the second term above corresponds to a kinetic term for the source .",
    "the first term is a massless pole .",
    "this pole can not be attributed to a composite particle built out of cft fields , since in the high momentum regime the conformal symmetry is unbroken .",
    "the correct interpretation is that a new elementary degree of freedom appears in the theory and marries with the source field via a mass mixing on this branch .",
    "the source mass can be extracted from the correlator and is @xmath46 this mass is defined near the uv scale and , due to radiative corrections involving cft interactions , will be modified as we run down to the ir scale .",
    "notice that as the source field becomes massive , the cft produces an exponentially light mode . expanding ( [ spectrum2 ] ) for @xmath47 for values @xmath48",
    ", we find that @xmath49 we might then expect that the massless eigenstate is primarily composed of this composite state , which indeed is the case for @xmath44 . on the other hand , for @xmath43 , the source field is chiral and no light composite mode exists , indicating that the massless eigenstate is primarily elementary .    the scaling dimension of the operator @xmath37 can also be extracted from @xmath38 , and is given by @xmath50 this tells us when the source / cft mixing is relevant , marginal , or irrelevant in terms of the bulk mass parameter @xmath51 .",
    "because of the source - cft interaction @xmath52 , the physical spectrum is given by ( [ spectrum1 ] ) rather than ( [ spectrum2 ] )",
    ". this can be viewed as a result of quadratic mixing between the elementary source field and the composite resonances in the effective lagrangian .",
    "we now move on to our primary goal of a quantitative description of this elementary / composite mixing .",
    "we are now ready to propose the holographic basis for fermions .",
    "the idea is very simple : we expand the bulk fields @xmath23 in a set of 4d fields corresponding to a purely elementary sector and a tower of cft resonances .",
    "consider the following alternate expansion of the bulk fields : @xmath53 where @xmath54 corresponds to the elementary source field , the @xmath55 correspond to the cft bound states , and @xmath56 is an additional elementary degree of freedom external to the cft .",
    "obviously the holographic profiles @xmath57 must differ from the kk profiles @xmath58 if we are to describe holographic mixing .",
    "let us first discuss the composite profiles @xmath59 .",
    "as we pointed out in the previous section , the cft resonances have diagonal masses given by the spectrum ( [ spectrum2 ] ) .",
    "hence , the profiles @xmath59 must satisfy the bulk equation ( [ eom1 ] ) with @xmath35 replaced by @xmath40 , as well as the following holographic boundary conditions : @xmath60 the cft wavefunctions are therefore given by @xmath61 , \\label{gcft}\\ ] ] with the coefficient @xmath62 determined from the holographic boundary conditions ( [ holobc ] ) : @xmath63 we see explicitly that ( [ kappa ] ) is equivalent to ( [ spectrum2 ] ) .",
    "we also give the normalization @xmath64 ( chosen so the resonance kinetic term is canonical ) which is useful when computing the mixing coefficients in the holographic lagrangian : @xmath65    now consider the source wavefunction . in analogy with the scalar case @xcite , the ads / cft correspondence prescribes the bulk field @xmath27 to display the following asymptotic behavior in the uv in order to construct the proper boundary action : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the scaling dimension of the operator @xmath37 given in ( [ dimo ] ) .",
    "the field @xmath36 is the source field and is equivalent to @xmath54 appearing in ( [ holo+ ] ) up to an overall normalization .",
    "we therefore postulate as our source wavefunction @xmath68 the normalization @xmath69 renders the 4d action canonical .",
    "the source profile has a very simple holographic explanation .",
    "consider the profile with respect to a flat metric , @xmath70 , for large values of @xmath71 , corresponding to irrelevant source - cft mixing . in this case the source field is localized on the uv brane and thus has a very weak overlap with the composite cft resonances , which are ir localized . on the other hand , for @xmath72 where the source - cft mixing is relevant , the source field is in fact localized on the ir brane and overlaps very strongly with the composites .",
    "this picture is identical to the one obtained by analyzing the operator dimension @xmath67 ( [ dimo ] ) @xcite .",
    "the most difficult wavefunction to ascertain is @xmath73 associated with the elementary field @xmath56 . the primary motivation for the form of this profile will be that it reproduces the correct mass mixing between @xmath54 and @xmath56 ( [ m0 ] ) , as we will discuss in the next section .",
    "the correct wavefunction turns out to be @xmath74 for @xmath43 , the elementary field @xmath56 is absent from the theory , and furthermore , the source profile ( [ gsource ] ) is identical to the zero mode profile ( [ 0mode ] ) , which is clearly consistent with the source field being chiral .",
    "however , for @xmath44 , the external @xmath56 marries with the source @xmath54 via a mass mixing .",
    "as stated previously , this is seen in the correlator ( [ sigpole ] ) by the presence of a new pole which can not be attributed to the cft as it is present at high energies when the conformal symmetry is unbroken .",
    "we now have the tools to quantitatively describe elementary / composite mixing in theories with bulk fermions . inserting the holographic expansion ( [ holo+ ] ) and ( [ holo- ] ) into the action ( [ a3 ] ) , and integrating over @xmath75",

    "can be seen as a four - step field redefinition : @xmath84 let us discuss the role of each of the matrices in turn .",
    "first , we diagonalize the kinetic matrix @xmath85 with a field rotation @xmath86 .",
    "the kinetic energies are then diagonal , but not canonical , and thus need to be rescaled by the matrix @xmath87 .",
    "next , we diagonalize the ( rotated and scaled ) mass mixing matrix , @xmath88 with an additional field rotation @xmath89 .",
    "this leaves the mass matrix in the form @xmath90 .",

    "a particularly important result is that for @xmath43 , the composite states @xmath128 contain no zero mode component , @xmath129 since for these @xmath51 values the source wavefunction ( [ gsource ] ) is identical to the zero mode wavefunction ( [ 0mode ] ) .",
    "notice also in this case that @xmath130 .",
    "we will use these facts often in sec .",
    "5 when we analyze phenomenology in the holographic basis .",
    "in this section we will determine the explicit elementary / composite content of the standard model fermions in realistic warped models using the holographic basis . as a concrete example we will consider the basic scenario of @xcite , with the enhanced bulk gauge symmetry which provides custodial isospin to the higgs sector . in this setup",

    "the heavier fermions , in particular , the left - handed top and bottom quarks and the right - handed top quark , are generally given a bulk mass @xmath132 , and thus couple to relevant operators . in order to achieve a large top mass",
    ", the right - handed top must be significantly ir localized , near @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , we will assign characteristic @xmath51 values and compute precisely the content of the massless eigenstates . to solve the hierarchy problem",
    ", we will assume the following values @xmath134 and @xmath135 .      for light fermions , such as the electron ,",
    "the compositeness is completely negligible , as was the case for the graviton @xcite .",
    "we can see this explicitly by computing the eigenvector ( [ ev- ] ) for @xmath131 . in this limit",

    "the zero mode is mildly localized on the ir brane , and we will take for concreteness @xmath141 . transforming from the holographic basis to the mass eigenbasis , we determine the content of each mode : @xmath142 we see that the zero mode contains a significant mixture of cft bound states .",
    "notice also that the massive modes are purely composite .",
    "this case has many of the same features as the gauge boson @xcite , which is flat in the bulk and couples marginally to the cft .",
    "consider now the case of the right - handed top quark @xmath143 which is exponentially peaked on the ir brane .",
    "different values are taken in the literature for the mass @xmath144 , but in nearly all cases @xmath145 in order to obtain an @xmath138 yukawa coupling .",
    "if @xmath146 , the mixing is qualitatively similar to that of @xmath147 just considered . in particular",
    ", the zero mode will be mostly elementary , while the kk modes are purely composites . at @xmath148 ,",
    "the massless mode is approximately half elementary and half cft bound states .",
    "this is consistent with the scaling dimension of the dual operator ( [ dimo ] ) , which takes its lowest value at this point .",
    "we might have instead guessed that @xmath143 was primarily composite , based on its ir localization .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , localization is only a rough guide to the dual interpretation , in particular in the region where strong mixing occurs .",
    "now consider @xmath149 .",
    "we know that on this branch the source field marries with a new elementary field and becomes massive . on the other hand , there is an ultra - light mode in the cft spectrum ( [ lightcft ] ) .",
    "we therefore expect the sm @xmath143 to be primarily a composite state . to see this using the holographic basis , let us take a phenomenological value @xmath150 , and compute the transformation matrix : @xmath151 notice that the sm @xmath143 is roughly a 50/50 mixture of the source field and the first cft composite state .",
    "also for this case the kk modes now contain some elementary component , different from the case @xmath43 .",
    "we will now use the holographic basis to understand the phenomenology of warped models from the dual perspective of sm partial compositeness .",
    "of course , at a qualitative level ( and even semi - quantitative ) , many of these translations have been discussed at various points in the literature .",
    "the new aspect that the holographic basis brings is a quantitative interpretation of these 5d geometric successes .",
    "in addition , our qualitative understanding is also improved , due to the fact that we can examine the structure of the effective lagrangian - the quadratic mixing between individual states in the elementary and composite sectors , as well as the various couplings and interactions that these states possess .",
    "we will examine three results : natural yukawa hierarchies among sm fermions , suppression of fcnc ( rs gim mechanism ) , and custodial su(2 ) and the @xmath152 parameter .",
    "yukawa coupling hierarchies are elegantly explained in rs models by fermion localization . in the dual picture",
    ", fermion localization translates into the dimension of the cft operator , and thus sm fermion masses result from elementary fields coupling to either relevant or irrelevant cft operators .",
    "we now analyze the yukawa couplings in the holographic basis emphasizing the connection with operator dimension .",
    "let us consider the simplest case of a higgs boson @xmath153 confined to the ir brane , corresponding to a purely composite field in the dual picture .",

    "the overlap integrals @xmath164 determine the strength of the effective yukawa interactions : @xmath165 where the holographic wavefunctions are given in ( [ gcft ] ) and ( [ gsource ] ) with the appropriate @xmath51 values .",
    "for most phenomenological cases , @xmath43 , so that the sm fermions are primarily elementary .",
    "more precisely , in this case only the source field @xmath54 contains the zero mode @xmath33 , while the composite modes are written in terms of a linear combination of massive kk states ( [ nozero ] ) .",
    "thus only the strength of the source - source yukawa coupling ( [ yss ] ) is important for sm fermions : @xmath166    * light fermions *    light fermions are described by the case @xmath131 , and in this case the scaling dimensions of the cft operators are large @xmath167 ( [ dimo ] ) .",
    "therefore the source / cft mixing is irrelevant , and the coupling to the higgs @xmath168 is exponentially suppressed : @xmath169    * heavy quarks *    to produce the large masses at low energy for the top and bottom quarks , the elementary fermions must couple to the cft through a relevant interaction , implying that one or both dual cft operators have scaling dimension @xmath170 . in the case of the bottom quark ,",
    "this can be achieved by having the left - handed bottom @xmath171 slightly ir localized , with ( @xmath172 ) and the right - handed bottom @xmath173 uv localized , with ( @xmath174 ) , yielding the coupling @xmath175 the suppression is not as severe and a larger yukawa coupling is obtained .",
    "the key point is that @xmath171 couples to the cft through a slightly relevant operator .    for the large top mass both @xmath176 and @xmath143 must interact with the cft via relevant operators ( @xmath177 ) , and",
    "an @xmath138 yukawa coupling is obtained : @xmath178    * composite fermions *    for heavy quarks , it may also be feasible to have @xmath44 , in which case the zero mode becomes mostly composite . in this scenario , both the source field and the composite cft states contain some zero mode component , and thus in principle all of the couplings ( [ yss])-([ynm ] ) contribute to the sm yukawa coupling .",
    "in particular , in the region @xmath118 , where the source couples to a relevant operator , this is indeed true and all couplings are important .",
    "however , the result is that the yukawa coupling is still of order one .    for illustrative purposes ,",
    "let us examine a more extreme case , which may or may not be relevant for phenomenology , where the heavy fermions are extremely ir localized @xmath119 . in this case",

    "the holographic wavefunction for this state @xmath182 approximately becomes @xmath183 which for @xmath184 matches the zero mode wavefunction @xmath185 ( [ 0mode ] ) .",
    "thus , the sm yukawa coupling in this range of @xmath51 is enhanced : @xmath186      the holographic basis has given us a quantitative understanding of yukawa couplings in the dual theory .",

    "notice that in general , the composites interact much more strongly than the elementary source , as expected since the composite dynamics are determined from an underlying strongly coupled gauge theory .",

    "the shaded region indicates relevant mixing . ]",
    "a striking success of warped models with fields in the bulk is the suppression of fcnc among light fermions  @xcite .",
    "generically , when fermions are separated in the extra dimension , large fcnc can be induced since the sm fermions will couple differently to kk modes of gauge bosons . in warped models ,",
    "however , light fermions in fact couple universally to kk gauge modes . when the fermions are transformed from flavor eigenstates to mass eigenstates , fcnc",
    "are not induced precisely because of this universal coupling , and thus these models enjoy a gim - like mechanism .",
    "the approximate gim mechanism suppressing kk / composite neutral currents has a very straightforward holographic explanation .",
    "the light fermions , as we previously discussed , are almost purely elementary , and so for our purposes , the only gauge couplings which are relevant are @xmath201 and @xmath202 . and",

    "the nonuniversal contributions arise from the source fermions coupling to composite vector modes and are contained in the second term in ( [ g1 ] ) .",
    "this sum can be performed analytically , as shown in the appendix , and the result is just what we expect : @xmath211 that is , the nonuniversal contribution is simply the difference between the total coupling and the universal piece , @xmath212 .    for light fermions , @xmath213 , this universal contribution dominates @xcite , and",
    "the sm fermions primarily interact through the triple source vertex shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "this can also be seen in fig.[fig1 ] , where @xmath214 is suppressed for @xmath131 .",
    "this suppression also occurs for higher couplings @xmath215 .",
    "the irrelevant interaction between the cft and source fermions , a consequence of large anomalous dimensions of cft operators , means that the direct coupling between sm fermions and composite vector modes is suppressed at low energies .",
    "however , the source gauge field couples marginally to a cft current leading to an @xmath216 universal contribution to @xmath217 .",
    "phenomenologically , it is important to track the flavor - violating contributions to the coupling @xmath217 @xcite .",
    "in fact , for @xmath218 , the first composite vector provides the dominant contribution to the nonuniversal coupling , @xmath219 , and we can neglect higher modes .",
    "it is possible to derive an approximate expression for @xmath214 for @xmath220 : @xmath221 although this expression deviates from @xmath222 for @xmath223 , fermions with such @xmath51 values ( e.g. the electron ) give numerically smaller contributions to flavor - violating operators .",
    "thus , the approximate formula ( [ nu ] ) may still be useful in practice .        for heavy quarks",
    "the circumstances are much different for two reasons .",
    "first , as we have shown quantitatively in the previous section , such third generation quarks can contain a significant composite mixture , so that in principle every vertex should be accounted for when trying to understand phenomenology . at the same time , these vertices are not suppressed , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] for @xmath72 , and can therefore not be neglected .",
    "this is also why heavy quarks , like @xmath143 , are likely to be important signals of new physics at the lhc , for instance kk gluons  @xcite , or flavor violation  @xcite .",
    "early attempts at extending sm fields into the bulk faced difficulties complying with electroweak precision tests .",
    "in particular , excessive contributions to the peskin - takeuchi @xmath152 parameter , arising from the exchange of kk modes of bulk gauge fields were incompatible with a natural solution to the hierarchy problem ( @xmath224 )  @xcite .",
    "the key insight into this dilemma was in fact gleaned from holography in ref .",

    "a global symmetry of the cft is dual to a bulk gauge symmetry , ref .",
    "@xcite remedied the problem by enlarging the bulk gauge symmetry to su(2)@xmath225su(2)@xmath226u(1)@xmath227 .",
    "the holographic basis allows for an especially transparent understanding of this custodial protection mechanism since we can explicitly analyze the effective lagrangian .",

    "the second line in ( [ t ] ) illustrates the custodial symmetry at work - the second term proportional to @xmath253 would be absent without the enlarged su@xmath230 sector , which partially cancels the contribution from the massive sm excitations .",
    "this can be explicitly seen by using the relation ( [ eigmass ] ) , which leaves the remaining nonzero contribution proportional to the strength of the custodial isospin breaking @xmath254 as anticipated . using ( [ sinth ] ) the @xmath255 enhancement in ( [ t ] )",
