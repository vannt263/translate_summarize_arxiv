    "supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the standard model ( sm ) assign a bosonic superpartner to every sm fermion and vice - versa .",
    "the theory that consider only the sm particles , their corresponding superpartners , and two higgs doublets is known as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite ) .",
    "the mssm lagrangian depends on 105 parameters that makes it difficult to apply for searches involving complex production and decay of the susy particles .",
    "analyses described in section  [ sect_squark_and_gluinos ] were done in the the minimal supergravity model with a reduced set of the parameters ( msugra  @xcite ) . in msugra",
    "the sparticles masses and couplings are defined by a set of only five parameters : @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively the universal scalar mass and the universal gaugino mass at @xmath6 ; @xmath7 , the universal trilinear coupling at @xmath6 ; tan  @xmath8 the ratio of the vacuum expectation value of the two higgs fields ; and @xmath9 , the sign of higgs - mixing mass parameter .",
    "searches for stop and sbottom quarks ( section  [ sect_stop_sbottom ] ) do not depend on susy parameters other then the masses of the sparticles . in all presented analysis r - parity is assumed conserved and thus the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable and all susy particles are produced in pairs .",
    "the d0 experiment was proposed in 1983 to study high mass states and large @xmath10 phenomena in proton - antiproton collisions at the fermilab collider complex . during 1996 - 2001",
    "both the tevatron and the d0 detector @xcite were significantly upgraded . in run",
    "ii ( which started march 2001 ) the fermilab collider operates at an increased center - of - mass energy of 1.96  tev and at higher instantaneous luminosity ( in range from @xmath11 @xmath12s@xmath3 in the beginning of run ii up to @xmath13 @xmath12s@xmath3 after 2006 ) .",
    "the d0 detector upgrade included new central tracking and new forward muon systems and an improved central muon system . in 2006",
    "the d0 tracking system was upgraded and the trigger system was improved .",
    "this report describes the analyses of the run ii d0 data sets collected between april 2002 and december 2008 .",
    "these searches were done using the msugra model ignoring the production of scalar top quarks . thus below the `` squark mass ''",
    "is the average of all other squarks .",
    "a search was made in 2.1 fb@xmath3 of data for the @xmath15 .",
    "the analysis explored @xmath16 plane of msugra parameters with fixed values of @xmath17 , tan  @xmath8=3 and @xmath18 .",
    "the minimum number of jets in the final state could be two ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , if the squark mass is less then the mass of the gluino ; three ( @xmath21 ) , at @xmath22 ; or four ( @xmath23 ) , if @xmath24 .",
    "for the dijet analysis events were required to pass an acoplanar dijet trigger , and a multijet and @xmath14 trigger was used for selection of events with higher number of jets .",

    "a veto on isolated electrons or muons with @xmath31  gev was also applied in all analyses to reject backrounds events with a lepton from @xmath32 boson decay . in the dijet analysis a cut on the minimum azimutal angle @xmath33 between the @xmath14 and any jet with @xmath34  gev",
    "was applied to suppress the qcd background .",
    "the two final cuts on @xmath14 and @xmath35 were optimized for each of the analyses by minimizing the expected upper limit on the cross section in the absence of signal .",
