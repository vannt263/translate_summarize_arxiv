    "equilibrium statistical physics makes use of statistical ensembles , like the microcanonical or the canonical one .",
    "the basic thermodynamic function in the microcanonical ensemble is the entropy @xmath6 as a function of some energy @xmath2 , magnetization @xmath3 , and/or further arguments , whereas in the canonical ensemble this role is played by the canonical free energy @xmath7 as a function of the temperature @xmath8 , a magnetic field @xmath9 , and/or further arguments .",
    "the computation of thermodynamic functions from statistical mechanics is a formidable , in most cases impossible task in general , but , as a rule of thumb , it is more difficult in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "this is the reason why , although the microcanonical ensemble is the most fundamental one of the statistical ensembles , one often resorts to the calculation of the canonical free energy @xmath10 instead .",
    "this is a reasonable way to proceed , as long as both options yield equivalent results .",
    "if this is not the case , one speaks of ensemble nonequivalence , and the occurrence of non - concave microcanonical entropy functions in systems with long - range interactions is a hallmark of this situation .",
    "then , unlike in standard thermodynamics where the concavity of the entropy is assumed , the entropy @xmath11 can not be obtained from the free energy @xmath10 by means of a legendre transform .    only in recent years",
    "the community of statistical physicists became aware that large deviation theory , a branch of probability theory , is a powerful tool to compute , among others , microcanonical quantities , at least for some classes of systems ( see @xcite for a mathematical treatise on large deviation theory with applications to statistical mechanics , or @xcite for a less formal presentation of the subject ) .",
    "explicit calculations of microcanonical quantities by means of large deviation theory can be found in @xcite for some models of physical interest ( the infinite range potts model , the hamiltonian mean - field model , and the colson - bonifacio model of a free electron laser ) .",
