    "observational cosmology has determined that the universe is homogenous and isotropic on scales larger than 100 mpc and that the universe is expanding according to hubble s law .",
    "measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) reveal that this homogeneity and isotropy existed even at the time of recombination to an extreme accuracy at the order of @xmath0 on all scales up to the present horizon .",
    "the modern standard model of cosmology attributes these observed properties of the universe to an early accelerating period , known as inflation  @xcite .",
    "the inflaton , the field that dominates the energy density of the universe during inflation , traditionally assumes a dual role : it drives the accelerated expansion and generates the primordial fluctuations that seed large scale structure .",
    "precision measurements of the cmb and large scale structure surveys ( lss ) have been instrumental in constraining the form of the inflationary lagrangian .",
    "this process of utilizing cosmological observations to limit the form of the inflationary lagrangian is called _ reconstruction _ , and relies on the assumption that there exists a unique mapping between the set of observables and the free parameters of the lagrangian .",
    "such a mapping exists in the framework of single field , canonical inflation under the slow roll approximation , and the program of reconstruction has been extensively developed @xcite .",
    "of course , this process assumes that the inflaton is responsible for generating the perturbations ; if this assumption is invalid then any process that seeks to ` invert ' a subset of observables to obtain the underlying free parameters of the lagrangian will reveal a space of lagrangians that is observationally degenerate  : many distinct theories will provide the same subset of observables @xcite .",
    "it is possible to liberate the inflaton from its role in generating the primordial perturbations . in curvaton scenarios",
    "@xcite , this role is assumed by an additional light degree of freedom decoupled from the inflationary dynamics ; in modulated reheating , perturbations are generated by fluctuations in the decay rate of the inflaton @xcite . in these theories , the central assumption of traditional reconstruction  that the inflaton generates the primordial spectra  is violated . without knowledge of how the spectra were generated , whether by the inflaton or by some other means , a unique inversion of observables is clearly impossible .",
    "the key to resolving this impasse is to recognize that while degeneracies might exist within a subset of observables , it might be possible to utilize additional observables as a means of distinguishing between different models . while this is the obvious solution , it is not clear which observables are relevant to which scenarios , or how effectively such observations enable reconstruction .",
    "it is now possible to state the _ degeneracy problem _ : what observations must be made to distinguish between different theories , and if these observations are not made how large is the resulting degeneracy ?",
    "the subsequent issue , one that we spend considerable time investigating in this work , is the _ inversion problem _ : given a distinguishing observation , how well can the set of observables be inverted to obtain the underlying inflationary potential , @xmath1 ?    in this paper , we examine these questions within the context of the curvaton scenario as a prototype of the case in which the perturbation spectra are not generated by the inflaton .",
    "we do not consider modulated reheating , as it is phenomenologically similar to the curvaton .",
    "our analysis employs monte carlo reconstruction , in which the inflationary model space is stochastically sampled and models satisfying specific observational constraints can be identified and extracted for further analysis .",
    "we perform reconstructions for single field canonical inflation ( serving as a reference model ) and the curvaton scenario .",
    "we first perform the reconstruction in the absence of any distinguishing observables to determine the size of the degeneracy , and then systematically investigate the effects that an observation of isocurvature perturbations , non - gaussianities , and a precision measurement of the tensor spectral index each has on reducing the degeneracy and enabling reconstruction .",
    "this analysis is far from exhaustive ; there are scores of inflationary scenarios beyond single field inflation and curvatons that could conceivably contribute to the degeneracy problem .",
    "for example , the altered dynamical degrees of freedom of non - canonical inflation @xcite also contribute to the degeneracy problem @xcite , and we investigate dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) inflation @xcite in detail as an example in @xcite . while other sources of degeneracy exist , we consider the curvaton and dbi inflation to be two well - motivated , well - studied and phenomenologically rich scenarios that are representative of two strong sources of degeneracy : non - inflaton produced primordial spectra and non - canonical inflationary dynamics , respectively . in the absence of a fully comprehensive analysis ,",
    "the results presented here combined with @xcite represent a ` best - case ' scenario for reconstruction , and should be viewed as a first step towards understanding how large the degeneracy might be , and which cosmological observables are needed to mitigate the problem . despite the significant challenges we identify in this study , it is our goal to determine which feasible cosmological observations will help us to best understand the fundamental physics behind the inflationary universe paradigm .",
    "the information gathered in this analysis is crucial to the planning and optimization of future cosmological experiments .",
    "the program of potential reconstruction was initiated in 1990 @xcite , and subsequently expanded and refined @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction program initially targeted inflation driven by a single , canonically normalized scalar field , @xmath2 , minimally coupled to gravity , = r - g^ _ _ - v ( ) . the analysis provides a framework for mapping power spectrum observables to the coefficients of a taylor expanded inflaton potential .",

    "the initially displaced curvaton rolls to its minimum where it begins to oscillate during the post - inflationary radiation dominated phase .",
    "these oscillations set up a small isocurvature perturbation that grows as the curvaton continues to oscillate .",

    "the variation in @xmath163 is large for @xmath297 for each @xmath167 detection , and the zoology is degenerate ( figure 3 ( b ) ) with hybrid models the only unique class . while the degeneracy is reduced with planck+decigo at @xmath299 ( figure 8 ( a ) ) , there is little room for a unique classification : the 1@xmath47 error on @xmath46 spans the entire y - axis , so small field models can not be uniquely classified , while large field models might be identified for a precise measurement of @xmath305 .",
    "with cmbpol , however , the zoology for @xmath297 is improved with bbo - grand and decigo ( figure 8 ( b ) and ( c ) ) ; with decigo , there exist regions in which a unique classification of hybrid , small , and large field models is possible .",
    "cmbpol at @xmath299 is shown in figures 8 ( d)-(f ) .",
    "unsurprisingly , the best combination is cmbpol+decigo for which the zoology almost reduces to that of single field inflation .",
    "lastly , we note that for @xmath205 , the zoology is degenerate for all direct detection sensitivities as well as an ideal b - mode detection .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have investigated the degeneracy problem that arises when the primordial power spectrum is generated by something other than the inflaton . we analyzed the curvaton as an example of this class of models .",
    "the curvaton was selected for our case study because it has been analyzed extensively in the literature and is phenomenologically similar to other scenarios in this class , such as modulated reheating .",
    "while the curvaton is representative of these models , we have analyzed but one corner of the potentially degenerate model space , and our results should therefore be considered a best - case scenario for reconstruction in the absence of any degeneracy - breaking observable . the importance of further input from theoretical model building to help diminish the degeneracy and inversion problems should not be underestimated : the more information we have about the underlying fundamental physics behind inflation , the better off we are in terms of the reconstruction program . for example , if the inflaton has dbi lagrangian and is non - minimally coupled to gravity , interesting observational signatures can arise @xcite . under certain circumstances",
    "the degeneracy between minimally and non - minimally coupled dbi inflationary models can be resolved @xcite .",
    "we consider another major source of possible degeneracies that can arise from non - canonical inflation in @xcite .    here , we first determined the size of the degeneracy by performing monte carlo reconstructions on both single field and curvaton models in the absence of observables that might serve to distinguish the curvaton , such as local non - gaussianities and/or isocurvature modes .",
    "we chose @xmath31 , @xmath46 , @xmath21 , and @xmath70 as base observables common to both models and found that reconstruction is degraded in the presence of an unresolved curvaton because it precludes a unique inversion of the observables to obtain the potential .",
    "we then introduced additional observables into our study : isocurvature modes , local non - gaussianities , and the tensor spectral index .",
    "while the former two observations break the degeneracy by ruling out single field inflation and lending support to the curvaton , our main focus was to study how well a set of degeneracy - breaking observables can be inverted to reconstruct the scalar potential .",
    "a comprehensive view of our results is presented in table 1 .",
    "we list the size of the errors on @xmath113 and @xmath114 that result from a detection of each observable considered in the analysis .",
    "the errors are given relative to the errors expected from single field inflation ( in the event that the observation rules out single field inflation , constraints are compared to single field as a benchmark ) , and in the second set of columns we display the uncertainties from each observation relative to the totally degenerate case .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath163 is most directly relevant to the zoology portraits shown throughout the paper .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    * _ null - detection . in the absence of a detection of non - gaussianities or isocurvature modes",
    " the degenerate case  constraints on @xmath113 and @xmath114 are each degraded by a factor of 4 and 6.5 , respectively , relative to single field inflation . in terms of the zoology , we find that only models with observables satisfying @xmath306 can be uniquely classified .",
    "these are hybrid models ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "even the improved measurements of @xmath46 and @xmath21 possible with cmbpol offer scant improvement .",
    "_ * _ non - gaussianity .",
    "the amplitude of non - gaussianities , @xmath128 , serves as a useful way to discriminate between the two theories , but the estimator is otherwise unhelpful for reconstruction . even with single field inflation ruled out in this case , a detection of more than the amplitude of the bispectrum is needed for inversion .",
    "we included the possibility of a measurement of the trispectrum but found that the projected uncertainties of future missions are too large to improve constraints on @xmath1 beyond the degenerate case .",
    "however , a measurement of the scale dependence of non - gaussianities offers modest improvement with planck when @xmath307 ( @xmath267 with cmbpol . )",
    "_ * _ isocurvature .",
    "a detection of an isocurvature contribution to the primordial density perturbation also serves to break the degeneracy and the amplitude and correlation angle of the mode facilitate a successful reconstruction .",
    "for a cdm isocurvature component , an uncorrelated mode offers the best constraints .",
    "the zoology becomes virtually identical to that of single field inflation .",
    "_ * _ gravitational waves .",
    "a precise measurement of the tensor index , @xmath167 , enables the use of the consistency relations of the degenerate models .",
    "even when the values of @xmath46 and @xmath167 satisfy both the single field and curvaton relations and the degeneracy persists , a precision measurement of @xmath167 can substantially reduce the degeneracy .",
    "the detection must be of sufficient quality : @xmath308 , with @xmath309 offering the best reconstructions ; this precision might be achieved with a future direct detection of primordial gravitational waves . since the curvaton reconstruction makes use of the consistency relation , a quality measurement of @xmath46 is also advantageous . with a planck detection of @xmath46 ,",
    "the degeneracy begins to clear for fiducial @xmath207 with decigo , but the degeneracy remains for smaller @xmath46 .",
    "however , with a cmbpol detection of @xmath46 , the degeneracy resolves partially for @xmath309 with bbo - grand and almost completely with decigo . in the case of small tensor / scalar ratio , @xmath310",
    ", we find that with cmbpol+bbo - grand and decigo , constraints on @xmath1 improve over the case of no @xmath167 but the zoology remains degenerate .",
    "lastly , an ideal detection of b - modes on cmb scales offers a reconstruction capability similar to that of cmbpol+bbo - grand .",
    "_    in summary , a detection of an isocurvature component , the scale dependence of local non - gaussianities , or a precision measurement of the tensor spectral index enable successful reconstructions .",
    "the consistency relation is most powerful when the constraints on @xmath46 and @xmath167 are optimized  with cmbpol and decigo , respectively .",
    "while the reconstruction in this case is practically equivalent to single field inflation , we require a favorable observational outcome ( @xmath309 ) , and optimistic foregrounds .",
    "we end by considering the possibility that @xmath208 and goes unmeasured by planck . in the degenerate case",
    ", a cmbpol detection of @xmath208 will constrain the energy scale of inflation , but it will not , by itself , improve constraints on @xmath113 or @xmath114 . in this case , the prospects of experimentally probing the detailed physics of the inflationary mechanism are rather dire . while detection of @xmath46 will provide enthralling evidence for the existence of gravitational waves",
    ", we have discovered that in order for cmbpol to adequately reconstruct the shape of @xmath1 , it must be paired with a precision direct detection of primordial gravitational waves .",
    "the resolution of the degeneracy and inversion problems will require a herculean effort on the part of precision observational cosmology : we will need better probes of b - mode polarization , advanced direct probes of primordial gravitational waves , and an improved understanding of foregrounds .",
    "it is important that we understand what we can expect to constrain with these future missions . in this analysis",
    "we have taken a small step towards attaining this understanding .",

    "<S> the discovery of many novel realizations of the inflationary universe paradigm has led to a degeneracy problem : many different inflationary lagrangians generate the same perturbation spectra . </S>",
    "<S> resolving this problem requires the future discovery of additional observables , beyond the scalar adiabatic and tensor two - point functions on cmb scales . </S>",
    "<S> one important source of degeneracy arises in models where the density perturbation is generated by a non - inflationary degree of freedom , for example , through curvatons or modulated reheating . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the curvaton scenario as representative of this class , and analyze the degeneracy with single field , canonical inflation that results if the curvaton goes undetected by future observations . </S>",
    "<S> we perform monte carlo potential reconstructions in the absence of distinguishing observables , such as non - gaussiantities or isocurvature modes . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting degeneracy is considerable and the improved measurements of spectral parameters from future probes like cmbpol , offer little to better the situation . given a degeneracy - breaking observation , the observables must still be inverted to obtain the inflationary potential , with different observations resulting in reconstructions of varying quality . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a future detection of isocurvature modes or a precision measurement of the tensor spectral index will enable the most successful reconstructions in the presence of curvatons . </S>"
