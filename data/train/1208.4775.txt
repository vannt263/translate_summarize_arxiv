    "planetary rings are one of the most remarkable and beautiful cosmic structures .",
    "they are considered to be natural dynamical laboratories @xcite , exemplifying the physics of cosmic disks , such as accretion disks or galactic disks , which are much larger and much farther away from earth .",
    "an exciting example is the presence of small moons embedded in saturn s rings , henceforth called moonlets , which have their analog in planetary embryos orbiting within a protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "the fact that the resolution of even _ cassini s _ cameras is too low to image these moonlets directly , brought up the idea of investigating moonlet induced putative structures in the rings @xcite , with the hope that these features could be captured by the spacecraft cameras or instruments .",
    "this then led to predictions of the propeller structures @xcite which are carved in the rings by the moonlet .",
    "subsequent numerical particle experiments @xcite completed the _ fingerprint _ of such gravitational perturbers and confirmed the spatial scaling of the propeller structure .",
    "depending on its size , an embedded ring - moon either creates a propeller ( sizes below 1 km ) or , alternatively , opens up a circumferential gap ( for sizes @xmath3 1 km , e.g. the ring - moons _ pan _ and _ daphnis _ ) .",
    "both structures , propeller and circumferential gap , are decorated with density wakes , completing the structural picture . up to this stage",
    ", all these density features have been assumed to occur only in the ring plane , a vertical stratification of moonlet induced structures has not seemed to be of importance .",
    "more than 150 propeller moonlets have now been detected @xcite and among them a few which are large enough to allow _",
    "cassini s _ cameras to take several snapshots of their propellers at different times , confirming in this way their orbital motion .",
    "those moonlets were nicknamed after famous aviators , e.g. : blriot , kingsford smith , earhart @xcite .    in the summer of 2009 , at saturn s equinox ( the sunset at saturn s rings ) , the perfect opportunity arose to detect any vertical structure deviating from the mean ring plane by observing shadows cast on the rings . at this time the density structures around the largest propeller moonlets , as well as those around the ring - moon _ daphnis _ , created prominent shadows .",
    "these can be assigned to the wakes and in the case of the propeller moonlets also to excited regions of the propeller , where the moonlet induces a partial gap .",
    "the shadows were much longer than the moon s size itself .",
    "the lateral extent of the shadows allows to conclude that moonlet induced vertical excursions of ring particles can be in the range of several kilometers in the case of _ daphnis _ or several hundred meters in the case of the large propeller moonlets .",
    "these very facts directly indicate the necessity to investigate the vertical stratification of moonlet induced structures , which has not been the focus of former models of the moonlet s _ fingerprint_. in this work we will study the vertical extent of moonlet induced propeller stuctures , focusing on the gap region of the propeller .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : extended_model ]",
    "the extended propeller model is presented . in section [ sec : gravitational_scattering ] the mass flow through the scattering region is calculated by a probabilistic approach , and values of the moonlet induced thermal velocities are determined , which are later used as initial conditions for the hydrdynamical equations .",
    "section [ sec : hydrodynamic_flow ] gives the hydrodynamical balance equations , which we use to model the diffusion of mass into the induced gap and the relaxation of the ring temperature . in section [ sec : propeller_height ] we calculate the height of the ring in the gap region of a propeller .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] discusses made assumptions and the application of our results to propeller features in saturn s rings .",
    "our results are summarized in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the first step in the formulation of our model , is to divide the planetary ring , composed of granular grains and one moonlet , into two regions :    1 .",
    "the scattering region , 2 .   the rest of the ring .    in this work",
    "we consider moonlets on circular , i.e. on non - inclined and non - eccentric , orbits .",
    "the scattering region is the small area ( volume ) around the moonlet where the majority of the trajectory changes , due to the moonlet s gravity , take place .",
    "this region of the embedded moonlet s gravitational influence is of the order of a few hill radii @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the semimajor axis of the moonlet , @xmath6 its mass and @xmath7 the mass of saturn . compared to the moonlet s semimajor axis",
    "the hill radius is usually very small . for large propeller moonlets , like blriot or earhart ,",
    "the ratio @xmath8 is approximately @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this low ratio naturally allows the splitting of the rings into the two regions , where the scattering region is shrunk to a line .    for the rest of the ring , where the moonlet s",
    "gravity is negligible , the moonlet induced structures are assumed to relax due to inelastic collisional cooling and viscous diffusion @xcite . in previous hydrodynamic models",
    "the former process , the relaxation of the granular temperature @xmath10 , has not been considered .",
    "this thermal relaxation and 3d - scattering are the major themes of this work .",
    "we describe the encounter of ring particles with the moonlet in a corotating frame , rotating about saturn with the mean motion of the moonlet .",
    "the frame s origin coincides with the mean orbital location of the moonlet .",
    "the x axis points radially outward , the y axis points into the azimuthal direction and the z axis is normal to the ring plane in a way that the axes form a right handed coordinate system .    with this , the dynamics of ring particles in the corotating frame is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the gravitational potentials due to saturn and the moonlet .",
    "the ring particles are on orbits with low eccentricity and inclination and the mass of the moonlet is very small compared to saturn s mass @xmath14 . in the vicinity of the moonlet the equations of motion of ring particles are well approximated by hill s equations @xcite .    with the scaled",
    "coordinates @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and scaled time @xmath18 hill s equations become @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the scaled distance to the moonlet and @xmath21 .",
    "these equations are point symmetric about the position of the moonlet ( @xmath22 ) , and quite comfortable , they do not depend on the moonlet mass anymore .",
    "all information of the moonlet mass is contained in the scaling length @xmath23 . when the ring particles are not in the vicinity of the moonlet , i.e. @xmath24 and therefore @xmath25 , their trajectories are well described by the solutions to the homogeneous hill s equations @xmath26 the semimajor axis , eccentricity and inclination are scaled according to @xmath27 where a spherically symmetric planet ( @xmath28 ) is assumed . the phases @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the longitude of pericenter and the longitude of the ascending node respectively .",
    "we integrate the equations of motion numerically for a set of test particles using a 5th order embedded runge - kutta scheme with adaptive step size control @xcite .",
    "the moonlet and saturn are assumed to be point masses .",
    "the integrations start upstream of the moonlet at an azimuthal distance of 1000 hill radii to the moonlet and are terminated when the test particle s azimuthal distance exceeds 1000 hill radii . these limits",
    "ensure that the region of interaction is well included in the integration .",
    "we take the initial semimajor axis of the test particles to be uniformly distributed in the range of @xmath31 to @xmath32 hill radii radial distance to the moonlet .",
    "the initial eccentricities and inclinations of the test particles are choosen to be rayleigh distributed @xmath33 with uniformly distributed initial phases @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this is a fair assumption for many kinds of disks @xcite .",
    "this distribution of orbital elements corresponds to a triaxial gaussian velocity distribution @xmath36 with a diagonal velocity dispersion tensor @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the scaled quantities @xmath41 , @xmath42 are related to the unscaled ones by @xmath43 we choose the ratio @xmath44 , which is consistent with the above gaussian velocity distribution @xcite and which is a reasonable value if we neglect self gravity @xcite .",
    "this deviation from the maxwellian velocity distribution of conservative gases is an expression of the non - equilibrium state , caused by the steady dissipation of orbital energy in collisions .",
    "this energy loss is counterbalanced by the energy gain due to viscous keplerian shear , guaranteeing a quasi - equilibrium manifested by a steady state .",
    "this energy pumping goes at the expense of the collective keplerian motion and thus the ring particles spiral slowly into saturn in the long term ( @xmath45 years ) . during the trajectory integrations , the test particles and the moonlet",
    "are assumed to be point masses and the minimal distance of the test particles to the moonlet is recorded . for simplicity , we ignored particles which would collide with a spherical moonlet of finite size in further calculations .",
    "to estimate the difference , we also examined the case where all particles are used .",
    "although the radial position of the maximally induced ring temperature changes a bit , we found no significant changes in the resulting gap averaged heights .",
    "we use the approach of @xcite to describe the mass transfer through the scattering region .",
    "motivated by the chaotic behaviour of single particle trajectories near the moonlet @xcite , the encounter of ring particles with the moonlet is modelled by a probabilistic markov chain model .",
    "the results of the test particle integrations are used to calculate transitional probabilities between initial ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) and final ( @xmath48,@xmath49 ) positions of the test particles at the azimuthal boundary of the scattering region .",
    "these probabilities define a scattering operator @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the probability that matter is scattered from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "the primes denote values after the scattering .",
    "we assume that the scattering region can be approximated by the @xmath46-@xmath47 plane at @xmath54 , which connects saturn and the moonlet and is analogous to the scattering line of @xcite . in our model",
    ", the complete action of the moonlet on the ring particles happens at this scattering plane .",
    "the scattering operator relates the azimuthal mass flux entering the scattering region to the azimuthal mass flux leaving the scattering region @xmath55 mass conservation is expressed as a condition for the scattering operator @xmath56 also illustrating that accreting particles are ignored here .    for the numerical calculation of the scattering operator",
    "we divide the radial and the vertical direction into bins .",
    "the bin @xmath57 describes the region @xmath58 , @xmath59 being an index in radial direction and @xmath60 one in vertical direction . in the following ,",
    "primed bin indices refer to the situation after the scattering by the moonlet and unprimed ones to the situation before .    the discretized scattering operator is then calculated by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number of test particles starting in bin @xmath57 .",
    "we use an averaging procedure to calculate the number of test particles @xmath63 starting in bin @xmath57 and ending in bin @xmath64 . for each radial end bin @xmath65 , describing the interval @xmath66 , the time per orbit , the test particle will stay in this radial end bin is calculated @xcite @xmath67 @xmath63 is then calculated by @xmath68 where the sum is over all test particles and @xmath69 is @xmath70 for test particles starting in bin @xmath57 and @xmath71 otherwise .    outside the scattering region",
    "we describe the ring using hydrodynamical equations .",
    "we assume that the fluid parcels entering and leaving the scattering region have a keplerian azimuthal mean velocity @xmath72 .",
    "the azimuthal mass flux at the scattering plane is then @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the mass density .",
