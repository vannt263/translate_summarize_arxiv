    "in his seminal paper @xcite , werner israel considered the dynamics of a self - gravitating thin matter shell .",
    "the main purpose of his theory was to find a simple model describing gravitational collapse . in case of a realistic collapse ,",
    "equations describing evolution of matter and gravity are extremely difficult to handle .",
    "israel s idea was that many aspects of the collapse may be investigated within a toy - model , which consists of a matter shell and the surrounding gravitational field .",
    "the dynamics of such a system reduces to a proper tailoring of the two different vacuum solutions describing the two sides of the shell .",
    "we are going to present a systematic derivation of the israel model from the variational principle and the construction of its canonical ( hamiltonian ) structure . in our approach",
    "the space - time @xmath0 consists of two parts , tailored together along a hypersurface @xmath1 , which contains a moving matter shell .",
    "`` tailoring '' means that the induced metric @xmath2 of @xmath1 is continuous . on the other hand ,",
    "the four - dimensional connection coefficients @xmath3 may be discontinuous on @xmath1 .",
    "it is proved that the singular part of the einstein curvature tensor density of such a space - time contains derivatives of those discontinuities and may be defined in the sense of distributions as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a dirac delta distribution concentrated on @xmath1 . as we show in the sequel ,",
    "the following relation holds : @xmath6\\ , \\ ] ] where square brackets denote jump of the extrinsic curvature across @xmath1 , written in the adm form .",
    "the singular einstein tensor density matches the singular ( concentrated on @xmath1 ) energy - momentum tensor density of the matter shell .",
    "distributional gauss - codazzi equations are then derived ( and not _ postulated _ , as in the israel approach ) .",
    "they imply that both the einstein tensor density and the matter energy - momentum tensor density are conserved .",
    "we prove that the conservation law @xmath7 can be written in terms of the three - dimensional geometry of @xmath1 .",
    "the possibility of defining the singular einstein tensor and calculating its divergence ( in the sense of distributions ) _ via _ the standard formulae of riemannian geometry , simplifies dramatically the calculational part of the theory . for this purpose",
    "we must assume that the four - dimensional metric is continuous across @xmath1 .",
    "at this point our approach differs from the technics used by many authors , including w.  israel himself , who always stressed that no assumptions about the continuity of the four - metric , except for the continuity of the three - metric on the surface @xmath1 , are necessary .",
    "this is , of course , true .",
    "we observe , however , that our `` additional condition '' on the continuity of the entire four - dimensional metric , does not contain any geometrical or physical condition imposed on configurations of the physical fields considered by us , but is merely a gauge condition imposed on coordinate systems used .",
    "whenever an intrinsic three - dimensional metric of @xmath1 is continuous , then also the remaining four components of the four - dimensional metric may become continuous after a suitable coordinate transformation . in this new coordinate system",
    "we can use our technics based on the distribution theory , but the dynamics derived this way is written in terms of intrinsic , geometric relations , having sense in an arbitrary system of reference .",
    "hence , our derivation does not depend upon particular gauge conditions which we use .",
    "note that even in a perfectly smooth , flat space - time , we can introduce a coordinate system , in which only intrinsic three - dimensional metric on a fixed hypersurface @xmath8 is continuous , whereas the other four components of the four - dimensional metric @xmath9 may be discontinuous . using these `` singular coordinates '' one can properly formulate e.g. ,  the initial value problem for the maxwell field , but nobody uses such a formulation for obvious reasons .",
    "our additional assumption on the continuity of space - time metric is motivated by similar reasons : not to complicate things which already are complicated enough .",
    "the technical flexibility we obtain this way , i.e. ,  the possibility of defining the singular geometric objects living on @xmath1 _ via _ standard geometric formulae , where the derivatives are understood in the sense of distribution , is the main profit of our approach .",
    "the structure of the paper is following . at the beginning",
    "we derive israel s model from variational principle , first in the lagrangian formulation , and then  after performing an appropriate legendre transformation  in the hamiltonian picture .",
    "many technical elements of the construction presented here come from the papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a significant simplification of the calculations is obtained using consequently tensor densities instead of tensors for such quantities like the matter energy - momentum and the einstein curvature object ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "part of presented calculations was included in phd thesis of one of us @xcite .",
    "consider a space - time consisting of two parts which are tailored together along a hypersurface @xmath1 , whose non - degenerate metric has the signature @xmath10 . unlike in the original israel s approach ( which was also used in @xcite ) , here we restrict ourselves to coordinate systems for which all the components of the space - time metric are _ continuous_. as was already mentioned , this condition does not limit the applicability of our formalism and may be treated as merely a `` gauge condition '' imposed on the coordinate system .",
    "it simplifies dramatically theoretical description of the model .",
    "further simplification is obtained by using a coordinate system such that the hypersurface @xmath1 is given by the equation @xmath11 .",
    "metric derivatives along @xmath1 ( i.e. ,  @xmath12 , where @xmath13 ) are continuous , whereas the transversal derivative ( i.e. ,  @xmath14 ) may have jumps over @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that the topology of @xmath1 is of the type @xmath15 , i.e. , it describes a history of a matter concentrated on a two - dimensional surface with the topology of the sphere @xmath16 .",
    "the shell divides the space - time into the internal and the external part with respect to the world tube @xmath1 . in both parts vacuum einstein equations",
    "may be derived in a standard way from the variational principle .",
    "hence , the regular part of the einstein tensor must vanish everywhere outside and inside of @xmath1 .",
    "only its singular part concentrated on @xmath1 is left .",
    "the singular part of the riemann tensor is proportional to the ( invariant ) dirac delta distribution @xmath17 concentrated on @xmath1 , because first derivatives of the metric ( and , whence , also the connection coefficients @xmath18 ) may be discontinuous across @xmath1 . in our particular coordinate system",
    "we have @xmath19 . as will bee seen in section [ dynamics ]",
    ", the resulting singular part of the einstein tensor will match the singular energy - momentum tensor describing matter concentrated on @xmath1 .",
    "this singular part may be obtained from the standard formula for the ricci tensor : @xmath20 a considerable simplification is obtained if we use the following combination of christoffel symbols : @xmath21 then we have : @xmath22 because @xmath23 may have only discontinuities of the `` jump - type '' across @xmath1 , the derivatives of @xmath23 along directions tangent to @xmath1 are thus finite and belong to the regular part of the ricci tensor .",
    "hence , its singular part consist only of the transversal derivatives : @xmath24 \\ , \\ ] ] where the square brackets denote the jump of a specific quantity across @xmath1 . hence , we have the following formula for the singular part of the einstein tensor density : @xmath25 where @xmath26\\ ] ] is a quantity living on @xmath1 .",
    "now , we are going to show that it is actually a 3-dimensional tensor density on @xmath1 .",
    "for this purpose we first show that its components transversal to @xmath1 vanish and , whence , its only non - trivial components are those tangential to @xmath1 . to prove that it transforms like a tensor density on @xmath1 let us observe that @xmath27 behaves like a 4-dimensional density , which splits into the 3-dimensional density on @xmath1 and the one - dimensional density along @xmath28 .",
    "but the dirac delta @xmath29 is already the density ( and not a scalar ! ) on the real axis @xmath28 which proves that the remaining object @xmath30 behaves indeed like a 3-density .",
    "hence , we have to prove the following    @xmath31    on both sides of @xmath1 consider the following combination of the connection coefficients : @xmath32 it is useful to encode the entire information about the metric in the following tensor density . ]",
    "@xmath33 hence , we have @xmath34 then the equation ( [ g - grube1 ] ) gives @xmath35 \\ .\\ ] ] now , we use metricity condition for the connection @xmath36 , which is fulfilled on both sides of @xmath1 ( indices @xmath37 label the coordinates on @xmath1 ) : @xmath38 but the metric components @xmath39 and their derivatives along @xmath1 are continuous across @xmath1 .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath40 = - \\frac 12 [ \\partial_a \\pi^{33 } ] = 0 \\ , \\\\",
    "\\frac 1{16 \\pi } { \\bf g}^3_{\\ 3 } & =   - \\frac 12 \\left ( \\pi^{ab } [ a^3_{ab } ] - \\pi^{33 } [ a^3_{33 } ] \\right ) = \\frac 12 [ \\partial_a \\pi^{3a } ] =   0 \\ , \\label{g32}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which ends the proof because in our coordinate system we have @xmath41 .",
    "equation ( [ g1 ] ) expressing the singular part of einstein tensor in terms of jumps of quantities @xmath42 across @xmath1 is extremely useful in our derivation of the shell dynamics .",
    "however , is not satisfactory from the geometric viewpoint because quantities @xmath42 do not have any geometrical meaning on both sides of @xmath1 , and only their jump across @xmath1 does .",
    "now , we are going to prove that we obtain the same result replacing non - geometric object @xmath42 by a tensor density @xmath43 which is , by definition , orthogonal to @xmath1 and whose restriction @xmath44 to @xmath1 is equal to the external curvature of the hipersurface @xmath1 in the adm ( @xcite ) representation . in our coordinate system @xmath45 , external curvature of @xmath1 is given by : @xmath46 and its adm version equals ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is a three - dimensional inverse of the induced metric @xmath2 on @xmath1 and @xmath49 .",

    "we obtain : @xmath58 the last term is identical on both sides of @xmath1 , because the metric components @xmath39 are continuous .",
    "hence , their jump across @xmath1 vanishes and , due to ( [ g1 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath59 \\ , \\ ] ] whereas the transversal components @xmath60 vanish . because the object @xmath61 is a well defined tensor density on both sides of @xmath1 , ( its definition does not depend upon coordinate system used ) , hence the tensorial character of the three - dimensional object",
    "@xmath62 has been proved .",
    "now , we are going to show that the total einstein tensor @xmath63 of our spacetime @xmath0 fulfills bianchi identities .",
    "because regular part of @xmath64 is discontinuous across @xmath1 and , moreover , it contains also a dirac - delta - like singular part , these identities must be understood in a distributional sense . to prove them we shall use gauss - codazzi equations , relating transversal components @xmath65 of the einstein tensor density @xmath64 to a divergence of external curvature @xmath66 on @xmath1 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the intrinsic , three - dimensional covariant derivative on @xmath1 .",
    "but the transversal component @xmath69 is a well defined three - dimensional object on @xmath1 . in our coordinate system , adapted to @xmath1 in such a way that the coordinate @xmath28 is constant on @xmath1 , this quantity is simply equal to a `` third '' component : @xmath70 . taking a jump of this equation across @xmath1",
    "we obtain the following identity : @xmath71 +    { \\overline{\\nabla } } _ a { \\bf g}^{a}_{\\ b }   \\equiv 0      \\ .\\ ] ] now , we are going to show that the left hand side is exactly the singular part of the bianchi divergence : @xmath72 .",
    "indeed , the regular part of this quantity vanishes on both sides of @xmath1 ( a consequence of the standard bianchi identities ) , whereas its singular part is proportional to @xmath5 . to prove this statement",
    "observe that @xmath73 and , whence , no derivative of the dirac delta is produced when we apply the covariant derivative @xmath74 to the singular tensor density ( [ einstein1 ] ) .",
    "what remains are thus the `` along @xmath1 '' derivatives @xmath75 . as a result of this operation",
    "we obtain , therefore , the quantity @xmath76 multiplied by @xmath5 .",
    "another @xmath77-like term is obtained from the regular part @xmath78 which is discontinuous across @xmath1 .",
    "taking the derivative @xmath79 of the regular part we obtain , therefore its jump of it across @xmath1 multiplied by the dirac delta : @xmath80 \\boldsymbol\\delta_s $ ] .",
    "finally , the singular part of the bianchi identities is the sum of the above two expressions : @xmath81 +    { \\overline{\\nabla } } _ a { \\bf g}^{a}_{\\ b } \\right )    \\boldsymbol\\delta(x^3 ) \\equiv 0      \\ , \\ ] ] where the last identity is just the gauss - codazzi equation .",
    "hence , we have shown that identities @xmath82 are also fulfilled for space - times with a singular curvature .",
    "dynamical equations of the physical system composed of a matter shell and the surrounding gravitational field will be derived from the action principle @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the sum of the gravitational action and the matter action .",
    "gravitational action , defined as the integral of the hilbert lagrangian @xmath85 , splits into the regular @xmath86 and the singular part @xmath87 , according to the decomposition of the curvature @xmath88 ( a similar `` mixture '' of a `` bulk action '' and a singular `` body action '' concentrated on a submanifold was recently used by c.  barrabs and w.  israel  see @xcite  to derive brane dynamics in general relativity ) .",
    "using formulae ( [ einstein1])([1g^3=0 ] ) , we express the singular part of @xmath89 in terms of the singular part of the einstein tensor : @xmath90 hence the total action is the sum of three integrals : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a spatially compact four - dimensional region with boundary in @xmath0 , which is possibly cut by a three - dimensional surface @xmath1 ( actually , because of the dirac - delta factor , the second term reduces to integration over @xmath93 ) .",
    "variation is taken with respect to the spacetime metric tensor @xmath94 and to the matter fields @xmath95 living on @xmath1 . at the moment",
    "we do not specify the nature of the matter fields .",
    "it is enough to assume that they are geometric objects living on this surface and that matter lagrangian @xmath96 is a scalar density on @xmath1 , which depends locally on the values of those fields , their derivatives along @xmath1 and the metric of the surface @xmath1 .    from the point of view of the two regular half - spacetimes ( which are tailored across @xmath1 )",
    "the singular part of the action arises as the sum of the boundary contributions from both the sides of the shell . on the other hand",
    ", the action does not contain any surface term at infinity .",
    "this is due to the techniques used here ( cf . @xcite ) , where we first derive the field dynamics within a spatially compact region @xmath92 and then shift its boundary @xmath97 to the space infinity . of course",
    ", the boundary manipulations at infinity are still necessary but in our approach they arise as a legendre transformation between different control modes at the boundary @xmath97 ( see section [ legendre ] ) .",
    "there are many ways to calculate variation of the hilbert lagrangian . here",
    ", we use a method proposed by one of us ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is based on the following , simple observation : @xmath98 expressing @xmath99 in ( [ deltar1 ] ) by the connection coefficients @xmath18 and their derivatives , it is easy to show that the last term on the right hand side is a complete divergence due to the following identity : @xmath100 where , besides of the quantity ( [ pi - kanon ] ) , we have introduced the following notation : @xmath101 and @xmath102 proof of the identity ( [ pidr ] ) is straightforward if one uses the fact that @xmath18 _ are not _ independent quantities but the connection coefficients , i.e. , ,  combinations of the metric components @xmath94 and their derivatives .",
    "this means that the covariant derivative @xmath103 with respect to connection @xmath36 vanishes identically .",
    "taking into account the fact that @xmath104 is a tensor density we have that : @xmath105 which implies identity ( [ pidr ] ) in a simple way see @xcite ) .",
    "finally , variation of the regular part of the hilbert lagrangian is following : @xmath106 we are going to show now that the same equation holds for the singular part of @xmath89 , i.e. , @xmath107    calculate the singular part of @xmath108 .",
    "because all these quantities are invariant , geometric objects ( @xmath109 is a tensor ! ) , we may calculate them in an arbitrary coordinate system .",

    "now , consider the matter part of the action .",

    "vanishing of the variation @xmath128 with fixed boundary data implies , therefore , the euler - lagrange equations for the matter field @xmath95 , together with einstein equations for gravitational field .",
    "regular part of einstein equations :    @xmath129    is satisfied in the whole space - time , whereas the singular part @xmath130 must be fulfilled on @xmath1 . this way the israel equations for the shell dynamics",
    "have been derived from the variational principle .",
    "information encoded in the three - dimensional object @xmath121 may be also expressed in terms of a four - dimensional energy - momentum tensor @xmath131 , where , in agreement with ( [ 1g^3=0 ] ) , the transversal components of @xmath132 vanish by definition : @xmath133 ( in our adopted coordinate system it simply means that @xmath134 , but this condition in its previous form does not depend on the coordinate system ) .",
    "summing up the singular and the regular parts of the gravitational field , we write the variation of the total lagrangian as @xmath135 which is the starting point of our derivation of the dynamics of the system . we stress that this equation is an _ identity _ , implied by the structure of the action .",
    "field equations of the theory , i.e. , einstein equations for gravitational field and the euler - lagrange equations for matter fields , are equivalent to vanishing of the volume part of the above variation ( i.e. , of the first two terms ) : @xmath136 this , in turn , is equivalent to the fact that for arbitrary variations ( non necessarily vanishing on the boundary ! ) of the independent fields @xmath126 and @xmath127 , variation of the lagrangian reduces to the boundary part : @xmath137 the whole dynamics of the system  matter + gravity \" is , therefore , equivalent to the above equation . similarly as in equation ( [ delta - s1 ] ) , we can use the definition of @xmath138 and express it in terms of contravariant tensor density @xmath39 obtaining @xmath139 hence field equations can be written in the following way : @xmath140    we complete this section with the noether theorem for the energy - momentum tensor which , due to bianchi identities , provides the necessary consistency condition for the einstein equations or , equivalently , . in fact , due to the regular part of einstein equations , bianchi identity reduces to : @xmath141 .",

    "the above form of field equations is analogous to the lagrangian form of the dynamics in theoretical mechanics , which may be written as follows : @xmath144 and contains relation between momenta and velocities : @xmath145 as well as newton equations : @xmath146 this formula is a starting point of derivation of the hamiltonian form of the dynamics .",
    "it is sufficient to perform lagrange transformation between @xmath147 and @xmath148 , putting : @xmath149 and move the total derivative @xmath150 to the left hand side of the equation ( [ mech - l ] ) . this way we obtain the hamiltonian formula : @xmath151 where we have put @xmath152 .",
    "this formula is equivalent to the hamiltonian form of the equations of motion : @xmath153    in order to derive the hamiltonian formulation of the field theory , we perform a similar legendre transformation between time derivatives of the fields and corresponding momenta . for this purpose",

    "this way the theory becomes a hamiltonian system , with the space of cauchy data on each of the three - dimensional surfaces @xmath154 playing role of an infinite - dimensional phase space . unlike in case of the classical mechanics , the dynamics of such a system is not uniquely defined , unless we control also boundary data for the field in an appropriate way .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the case of an asymptotically flat space - time and assume that also the leaves @xmath155 of our ( 3 + 1)-decomposition are asymptotically flat at infinity . to keep control over 2-dimensional surface integrals at spatial infinity , we first consider dynamics of our `` matter + gravity '' system in a finite world tube @xmath156 , whose boundary carries a non - degenerate metric of signature @xmath10 . at the end of the day we shall shift the boundary @xmath157 of the tube to space - infinity .",
    "we assume that the tube contains the surface @xmath1 together with our matter travelling over it .    to simplify calculations we choose coordinate system adapted to this ( 3 + 1)-decomposition .",

    "we assume that these surfaces are space - like . to obtain hamiltonian formulation of our theory",

    "they will produce the adm  mass as the hamiltonian of the total `` matter + gravity '' system when we pass to infinity with @xmath165 . because our approach is geometric and does not depend upon the choice of coordinate system , we may further simplify our calculations using coordinate @xmath28 adapted to both @xmath1 and to the boundary @xmath157 of the tube .",
    "we thus assume that @xmath28 is constant on both these surfaces .    integrating ( [ divergence - a1 ] ) over the volume @xmath159",
    "we thus obtain : @xmath166 where by `` dot '' we denote the time derivative . in this formula",
    "we have skipped the two - dimensional divergencies which vanish when integrated over surfaces @xmath164 and @xmath167 ( see fig . 1 below ) :    to further simplify our formalism , we denote by @xmath168 the time - like component of the momentum canonically conjugate to the field variable @xmath95 .",
    "now we perform the legendre transformation in material variables : @xmath169 the last term , put on the left - hand side of ( [ generate-201 ] ) , meets the matter lagrangian and produces the matter hamiltonian ( with minus sign ) , according to formula : @xmath170 where the canonical energy - momentum tensor is defined as follows : @xmath171    even if singular , the above quantity satisfies the standard rosenfeld - belinfante identity ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which states that the _ canonical _ energy - momentum tensor is equal ( modulo a minus sign , due to the convention used here ) to the _ symmetric _ energy - momentum tensor .    *",
    "( rosenfeld - belinfante ) * : symmetric and canonical energy - momentum tensors are , essentially , the same .",
    "more precisely , the following identity holds : @xmath172 or , equivalently , @xmath173 because both the transversal parts : @xmath174 and @xmath175 vanish identically from the definition .",
    "we remember that @xmath176 is a scalar density on @xmath1 and , therefore , may be written as @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is a scalar function , depending exclusively upon quantities @xmath179 .",
    "but the only way to produce a scalar from the partial derivatives @xmath180 is to take the following combination : @xmath181 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath182 this implies identity in a straightforward way ( cf .",
    "also @xcite )",
    ".    now , we are ready for the proof of the noether theorem :    the invariant character of the matter lagrangian @xmath183 means that , for any vector field @xmath184 on @xmath1 , dragging the arguments @xmath179 along @xmath184 produces the same effect on the lagrangian that dragging it directly as a scalar density . choosing any coordinates @xmath185 on @xmath1 and choosing @xmath186 we obtain , therefore , the following identity : @xmath187 where we have used the symmetry of second derivatives : @xmath188 and the definition of the symmetric energy - momentum tensor @xmath132 .",
    "putting now the last two terms on the left - hand side and using the rosenfeld - belinfante theorem we obtain : @xmath189 it may be easily checked that the left hand side is precisely the covariant divergence @xmath190 on @xmath1 ( remember that @xmath132 _ is not _ a tensor but the tensor density ! ) .",
    "hence , we obtain a kinematic identity , fulfilled by arbitrary field configurations , not only those fulfilling field equations : @xmath191 this completes the proof .",
    "now , integrating equation ( [ t001 ] ) over the two - dimensional region @xmath167 , we obtain the `` material '' part of the total ( `` matter + gravity '' ) hamiltonian : @xmath192 where @xmath193 .",
    "hence , the legendre transformation in material degrees of freedom gives us the following formula : @xmath194 where we denote @xmath195 here , the matter degrees of freedom are already described in the hamiltonian picture ( with the matter hamiltonian `` @xmath196 '' on the left hand side ) and the gravitational degrees of freedom still remain on the lagrangian level .      to perform also legendre transformation in gravitational degrees of freedom",
    " analogous to transformation ( [ legender - matter1 ] ) in material degrees of freedom  we follow here a method proposed by one of us ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we show in the appendix that , after the transformation , formula assumes the following form : @xmath197 here , we have introduced the following notation : @xmath198 denotes the external curvature of @xmath199 written in the adm  form , i.e. , given by the equations : @xmath200 and @xmath201 stands for three - dimensional contravariant metric , invariant to the metric @xmath202 induced on the cauchy surface @xmath159 .",
    "similarly , @xmath203 denotes the external curvature for denoting external curvature of the world tube @xmath157 to distinguish it from external curvature of the shell @xmath1 , which is denoted by @xmath66 .",

    "moreover , @xmath205 denotes the two - dimensional volume form on @xmath164 , whereas @xmath206 is the hyperbolic angle between the cauchy surface @xmath159 and the tube @xmath157 .",
    "the formula has been derived in the paper @xcite for a wide class of matter lagrangian ( including also gauge fields ) , but only for models with the continuous matter distribution .",
    "now we have proved its validity also in case of a singular matter , concentrated on a two - dimensional shell @xmath1 , whose internal metric is non - degenerate and carries signature @xmath10 .",
    "observe that the first term on the left hand side of vanishes identically due to einstein equations in is often denoted by @xmath207 , where @xmath208 and @xmath209 are the scalar and the vector constraints respectively . ] which means that the volume part of the total `` gravity + matter '' energy vanishes identically .",
    "this does not mean that the energy vanishes , because there is also another , surface contribution to the hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , a detailed analysis ( see @xcite ) shows that we are not allowed to control freely the tube external curvature @xmath210 in the last integral of because of constraints which occur here . the simplest way to overcome",
    "this difficulty is to perform another legendre transformation in the expression @xmath211 .",

    "@xmath223 the phase space of our system is thus described by the gravitational variables @xmath224 on the cauchy three - surface @xmath162 , and by the material variables @xmath225 concentrated on the two - surface @xmath226 , cf .  .",
    "as usual , gauss - codazzi equations imply constraints , which must be fulfilled by the cauchy data @xmath227 on a three - surface @xmath162 . outside of the shell",

    "we are going to derive the complete description of constraints , valid not only for the regular but also for the singular part of the data .",
    "we denote by @xmath228 the three - dimensional metric inverse to the metric @xmath202 and put @xmath229 .",
    "by @xmath230 denote the three - dimensional scalar curvature of @xmath202 , @xmath231 and `` @xmath232 '' is the three - dimensional covariant derivative with respect to @xmath202 .    outside of @xmath1 gauss - codazzi equations relate the components @xmath233 of the einstein tensor density with the cauchy data in the standard way .",

    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] equations ( [ wwd1 ] ) and ( [ wsd1 ] ) give a generalization ( in the sense of distributions ) of the usual vacuum constraints ( vector and scalar respectively ) .",
    "now , we will show how the distributional matter located on @xmath253 determines the four surface quantities @xmath254 $ ] and @xmath255 $ ] , entering into the singular part of the constraints . the tangent ( to @xmath1 )",
    "part of @xmath233 splits into the two - dimensional part tangent to @xmath253 and the transversal part .",
    "the tangent to @xmath256 part of einstein equations gives the following : @xmath257 which , due to ( [ gcww1 ] ) and ( [ wwd1 ] ) , implies the following constraints : @xmath258=-8\\pi\\tau^0{_k}\\ .\\ ] ] the remaining null tangent part of einstein equations reads : @xmath259 where @xmath260 , describes matter density on @xmath162 , and @xmath261 , is a surface energy density on @xmath1 .",

    "we have proved that the general scheme , used in @xcite and @xcite to describe any continuous , self - gravitating matter , may also be extended to the singular matter , concentrated on a 2-dimensional shell .",
    "the main result of this paper : the hamiltonian of the complete `` matter + gravity '' system is always equal numerically to the adm mass at infinity , similarly as in continuous models . the above structure was used in @xcite to derive the canonical formulation of a spherically symmetric dust shell .",
    "recently , it was proved that this result may be easily extended far beyond the dust case ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we stress , that the adm mass generates the hamiltonian evolution of the system with respect to the asymptotic time variable at space infinity , whereas the local redefinition of the cauchy surface @xmath268 surface , which does not change it at infinity , is merely a gauge transformation . if we want to use another time ( i.  e.  the minkowski time inside the shell or the shell s proper time ) there will be another hamiltonian generating the evolution in the new parametrization .",
