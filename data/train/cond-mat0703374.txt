    "the variety of crystallographic forms of carbon places this element into the focus of attention both in terms of basic research as well as applications .",
    "the _ tree - dimensional _ crystallographic forms - graphite and diamond - are known from the ancient times , and are widely used in industrial applications . recently discovered _ zero - dimensional _ ( fullerenes or cage molecules  @xcite ) and _ one - dimensional _ ( carbon nanotubes  @xcite ) forms are now extensively studied due to its remarkable and , often , unique mechanical and electronic properties . at the same time , despite very intensive research in the area , no any _ two - dimensional _ form of carbon has been known until very recently .",
    "ironically , this elusive two - dimensional form ( dubbed graphene ) , is , probably , the best theoretically studied carbon allotrope .",
    "graphene - planar , hexagonal arrangements of carbon atoms has been the starting point in all calculations on graphite , carbon nanotubes and fullerenes since late 40s  @xcite .",
    "however , its experimental discovery has been postponed till 2004 when a technique called micromechanical cleavage has been employed to obtain first graphene crystals  @xcite .",
    "the observation of a peculiar spectrum of charge carriers and anomalous quantum hall effect ( qhe ) in graphene  @xcite has initiated enormously growing interest to this field ( for review , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of the physics of graphene is that it provides a novel example of a `` feedback '' of condensed matter and material science on the fundamental physics .",
    "of course , this is not an unique case ; archetypical examples are the concept of spontaneously broken symmetry playing a crucial role in modern high energy physics and quantum field theory  @xcite and the use of mssbauer effect to check the general relativity theory  @xcite . at the same time , such relations are rather rare and always turn out to be very fruitful .",
    "actually , discovery of graphene has opened new ways to study some basic quantum relativistic phenomena which have always been considered as very exotic .",
    "probably the most clear example is the klein paradox  @xcite , that is , a property of relativistic quantum particles to penetrate with a probability of the order of unity through very high and broad potential barriers .",
    "previously it was discussed only for experimentally unattainable ( or very hard to reach ) situations such as particle - antiparticle pair creation at the black hole evaporation , or vacuum breakdown at collisions of super - heavy nuclei . at the same time , it appeared to be relevant for graphene - based electronics  @xcite .",
    "here we discuss similarities and differences between physics of charge carriers in graphene and quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "from the point of view of its electronic properties , graphene is a two - dimensional zero - gap semiconductor with the energy spectrum shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ grapheneband6 ] and its low - energy quasiparticles formally described by the dirac - like hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 @xmath3 ms@xmath4 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath5 are the pauli matrices . neglecting many - body effects ,",
    "this description is accurate theoretically  @xcite and has also been proven experimentally  @xcite by measuring the energy - dependent cyclotron mass in graphene ( which yields its linear energy spectrum ) and , most clearly , by the observation of a relativistic analogue of the integer qhe which will be discussed below .     and @xmath6 points . ]",
    "the fact that charge carriers in graphene are described by the dirac - like equation ( [ zero ] ) rather than the usual schrdinger equation can be seen as a consequence of graphene s crystal structure , which consists of two equivalent carbon sublattices a and b  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ grapheneband6 ] ) .",
    "quantum mechanical hopping between the sublattices leads to the formation of two energy bands , and their intersection near the edges of the brillouin zone yields the conical energy spectrum near the `` dirac '' points @xmath7 and @xmath6 . as a result , quasiparticles in graphene exhibit the linear dispersion relation @xmath8 , as if they were massless relativistic particles , with the role of the speed of light played by the fermi velocity @xmath9 . due to the linear spectrum",
    ", one can expect that graphene s quasiparticles behave differently from those in conventional metals and semiconductors where the energy spectrum can be approximated by a parabolic ( free - electron - like ) dispersion relation .    although the linear spectrum is important",
    ", it is not the only essential feature that underpins the description of quantum transport in graphene by the dirac equation . above zero energy , the current carrying states in graphene",
    "are , as usual , electron - like and negatively charged . at negative energies ,",
    "if the valence band is not completely filled , its unoccupied electronic states behave as positively charged quasiparticles ( holes ) , which are often viewed as a condensed - matter equivalent of positrons .",
    "note however that electrons and holes in condensed matter physics are normally described by separate schrdinger equations , which are not in any way connected ( as a consequence of the seitz sum rule  @xcite , the equations should also involve different effective masses ) .",
    "in contrast , electron and hole states in graphene are interconnected , exhibiting properties analogous to the charge - conjugation symmetry in qed  @xcite . for the case of graphene ,",
    "the latter symmetry is a consequence of its crystal symmetry because graphene s quasiparticles have to be described by two - component wavefunctions , which is needed to define relative contributions of sublattices a and b in the quasiparticles make - up .",
    "the two - component description for graphene is very similar to the one by spinor wavefunctions in qed but the `` spin '' index for graphene indicates sublattices rather than the real spin of electrons and is usually referred to as pseudospin @xmath10 .",
    "there are further analogies with qed .",
    "the conical spectrum of graphene is the result of intersection of the energy bands originating from sublattices a and b ( see fig .  [ grapheneband6 ] ) and , accordingly , an electron with energy @xmath11 propagating in the positive direction originates from the same branch of the electronic spectrum as the hole with energy @xmath12 propagating in the opposite direction .",
    "this yields that electrons and holes belonging to the same branch have pseudospin @xmath10 pointing in the same direction , which is parallel to the momentum for electrons and antiparallel for holes .",
    "this allows one to introduce chirality  @xcite , that is formally a projection of pseudospin on the direction of motion , which is positive and negative for electrons and holes , respectively .",
    "the term `` chirality '' is often used to refer to the additional built - in symmetry between electron and hole parts of graphene s spectrum and is analogous ( although not completely identical  @xcite ) to the chirality in three - dimensional qed .",
    "an alternative view on the origin of the chirality in graphene is based on the concept of `` berry phase ''  @xcite .",
    "since the electron wave function is a two - component spinor , it has to change sign when the electron moves along the close contour .",
    "thus the wave function gains an additional phase @xmath13 .",
    "the analogy with the field theory takes a very interesting twist , should we take into account that a sheet of graphene must always be corrugated .",
    "the fact that graphene crystals always exhibit some finite local curvature can be considered as a consequence of the mermin - wagner theorem , and has been confirmed experimentally both for graphene samples resting on a substrate  @xcite , as well as for free - hanging graphene films  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that harmonic approximation in the two - dimensional case does nt produce a solution with long - range order  @xcite .",
    "one can see this as bending instabilities , due to soft long - wavelength phonons , lead to membrane crumpling  @xcite .",
    "anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes changes the situation drastically and prevents the crumpling  @xcite .",
    "however , the membrane should be rippled in a sense that typical fluctuations in the direction perpendicular to the surface @xmath14 has a scale of order of @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the lattice constant , @xmath17 is the size of the sample and @xmath18 is the roughness exponent .",
    "the latter can be estimated as @xmath19  @xcite . for a typical sample size @xmath20 m ,",
    "the typical amplitude of the corrugation for free - hanging membrane at room temperature was estimated as 0.5 nm , with their characteristic size being about @xmath21 nm  @xcite .",
    "these ripples lead to important consequences for the electronic structure of graphene .",
    "the nearest - neighbor hopping integral @xmath22 turns out to be fluctuating due to its dependence on the deformation tensor  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24  are coordinates in the plane and @xmath25 are corresponding components of the displacement vector : @xmath26 taking into account this inhomogeneity in a standard tight - binding description of the electronic structure of graphene  @xcite one can obtain . instead of eq.([zero ] ) an effective dirac - like hamiltonian describing electron states near the @xmath7-point : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the `` vector potential '' connected with the deviations of the hopping parameters @xmath30 from their unperturbed value @xmath31 : @xmath32 where the nearest neighbors with vectors @xmath33 are labelled 1,2 , and 3 , correspondingly .",
    "this means that the roughness fluctuations acts on the electronic structure near the @xmath7-point as an abelian gauge field  @xcite which is equivalent to the action of random magnetic field .",
    "this means that the bending of graphene violates the time - reversal symmetry for a given valley ; of course , the umklapp processes between @xmath7 and @xmath6 points will restore this symmetry . as was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite these effective magnetic fields are responsible for suppression of the weak localization effects in graphene .    whereas smooth deformation of the graphene sheets produces gauge field similar to electromagnetic one , different topological defects in graphene inducing inter - valley ( umklapp ) processes can be considered as sources of a non - abelian gauge field ; corresponding analogy with gravitation was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in relativistic quantum mechanics ,",
    "chirality is a consequence of particle - antiparticle symmetry , which also guarantees linear energy spectrum for massless particles .",
    "the discovery of graphene opens a unique opportunity , to investigate _ chiral _ particles with _",
    "parabolic ( non - relativistic ) _ energy spectrum .",
    "quasiparticle with such unusual properties can be found in _",
    "graphene  @xcite . for two graphene layers ,",
    "the nearest - neighbor tight - binding approximation predicts a gapless state with _",
    "parabolic _ touching in @xmath7 and @xmath6 points  @xcite ( instead of conical band crossing in graphene ) . the electronic spectrum in this approximation is described by a single - particle hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 are electron momenta operators and @xmath36 is the effective mass .",
    "here we neglected higher - order hopping processes which are important only for very low fermi energies .",
    "more accurate consideration  @xcite gives a very small band overlap ( about 1.6 mev ) but at larger energies bilayer graphene can be treated as a gapless semiconductor . at the same time , electronic states are still characterized by chirality and by non - trivial berry phase @xmath37  @xcite ( in contrast to the case of graphene , where the berry phase was found to be @xmath38  @xcite ) .",
    "the term klein paradox  @xcite usually refers to a counterintuitive relativistic process in which an incoming electron starts penetrating through a potential barrier if its height @xmath39 exceeds twice the electron s rest energy @xmath40 ( where @xmath36 is the electron mass and @xmath41 the speed of light ) . in this case",
    ", the transmission probability @xmath42 depends only weakly on the barrier height , approaching the perfect transparency for very high barriers , in stark contrast to the conventional , nonrelativistic tunneling where @xmath42 exponentially decays with increasing @xmath39 .",
    "this relativistic effect can be attributed to the fact that a sufficiently strong potential , being repulsive for electrons , is attractive for positrons and results in positron states inside the barrier , which align in energy with the electron continuum outside . matching between electron and positron wavefunctions across the barrier leads to the high - probability tunneling described by the klein paradox .",
    "one can think about non - relativistic quantum mechanical tunneling though a potential barrier in terms of indeterminacy principle .",
    "since momentum and coordinates of a particle can not be measured simultaneously a particle can propagate through a classically forbidden region where the momentum is formally imaginary , and only coordinates are well defined . in _ relativistic _ quantum mechanics even coordinate itself can not be measured with arbitrary accuracy , due to pair creation at this measurement . in another words",
    ", the klein paradox illustrates that the relativistic quantum mechanics can be consistently formulated only in terms of fields rather than individual particles  @xcite .",
    "although klein s gedanken experiment is now well understood , the notion of paradox is still used widely , perhaps because the effect has never been observed experimentally .",
    "indeed , its observation requires a potential drop @xmath43 over the compton length @xmath44 , which yields enormous electric fields  @xcite(@xmath45 ) and makes the effect relevant only for such exotic situations as , for example , positron production around super - heavy nuclei  @xcite with charge @xmath46 or evaporation of black holes through generation of particle - antiparticle pairs near the event horizon  @xcite .",
    "at the same time , electronic structure of graphene provides us an unique opportunity for easy experimental realization of the klein ultrarelativistic tunneling in @xmath47 junctions  @xcite .",
    "let us consider for simplicity the potential barrier that has a rectangular shape and is infinite along the y - axis : @xmath48 this local potential barrier inverts charge carriers underneath it , creating holes playing the role of positrons . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume in eq.([bar ] ) infinitely sharp edges , which allows a direct link to the case usually considered in qed  @xcite .",
    "the sharp - edge assumption is justified if the fermi wavelength @xmath49 of quasiparticles is much larger than the characteristic width of the edge smearing , which in turn should be larger than the lattice constant ( to disallow umklapp scattering between different valleys in graphene ) .",
    "such a barrier can be created by the electric field effect using a thin insulator or by local chemical doping  @xcite .",
    "importantly , dirac fermions in graphene are massless and , therefore , there is no formal theoretical requirement for the minimal electric field @xmath50 to form positron - like states under the barrier . to create a well - defined barrier in realistic graphene samples with a disorder , fields @xmath51 routinely used in experiments  @xcite should be sufficient , which is eleven orders of magnitude lower than the fields necessary for the observation of the klein paradox for elementary particles .",
    "it is straightforward to solve the tunneling problem for dirac electrons  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the incident electron wave propagates at an angle @xmath52 with respect to the @xmath53 axis and then try the components of the dirac spinor @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the hamiltonian @xmath56 in the following form : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the fermi wavevector , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the wavevector components outside the barrier , @xmath61 @xmath62 is the refraction angle , @xmath63 , @xmath64 . requiring the continuity of the wavefunction by matching up coefficients @xmath65 , we can find the the reflection coefficient @xmath66 .     through a @xmath67-nm - wide barrier as a function of the incident angle for single- ( a ) and bi - layer ( b ) graphene .",
    "the electron concentration @xmath68 outside the barrier is chosen as @xmath69@xmath70 for all cases . inside the barrier ,",
    "hole concentrations @xmath71 are @xmath72 and @xmath73@xmath70 for solid and dashed curves , respectively ( such concentrations are most typical in experiments with graphene ) .",
    "this corresponds to the fermi energy @xmath11 of incident electrons @xmath74 and @xmath75mev for single- and bi - layer graphene , respectively , and @xmath76 nm . the barrier heights are ( a ) @xmath77 and ( b ) @xmath78mev ( solid curves ) and ( a ) @xmath79 and ( b ) @xmath80mev ( dashed curves ) . ]",
    "[ kleinangular]a shows examples of the angular dependence of transmission probability @xmath81 calculated using the above expression .",
    "the barrier remains _ always _ perfectly transparent for angles close to the normal incidence @xmath82 .",
    "the latter is the feature unique to massless dirac fermions and directly related to the klein paradox in qed .",
    "one can understand this perfect tunneling in terms of the conservation of pseudospin .",
    "indeed , in the absence of pseudospin - flip processes ( such processes are rare as they require a short - range potential , which would act differently on a and b sites of the graphene lattice ) , an electron moving to the right can be scattered only to a right - moving electron state or left - moving hole state .",
    "the matching between directions of pseudospin @xmath10 for quasiparticles inside and outside the barrier results in perfect tunneling . in the strictly one - dimensional case ,",
    "such perfect transmission of dirac fermions has been discussed in the context of electron transport in carbon nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "this is also the case for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) problem of graphene which can be directly proven by consideration of the lippmann - schwinger equation for scattering of arbitrary scalar potential ( see ref .  @xcite , supplementary information ) .    to elucidate which features of the anomalous tunneling in graphene",
    "are related to the linear dispersion and which to the pseudospin and chirality of the dirac spectrum , it is instructive to consider the same problem for bilayer graphene  @xcite .",
    "although `` massive chiral fermions '' with parabolic spectrum near the touching point and berry phase 2@xmath38 do not exist in the field theory their existence in the condensed matter physics ( confirmed experimentally  @xcite ) offers a unique opportunity to clarify the importance of chirality in the relativistic tunneling problem described by the klein paradox .",
    "charge carriers in bilayer graphene are described by an off - diagonal hamiltonian ( [ bilayer ] ) which yields a gapless semiconductor with chiral electrons and holes having a finite mass @xmath36 .",
    "an important formal difference between the tunneling problems for single- and bi- layer graphene is that in the latter case there are _ four _ possible solutions for a given energy @xmath83 .",
    "two of them correspond to propagating waves and the other two to evanescent ones .",
    "accordingly , for constant potential @xmath84 , eigenstates of hamiltonian  ( [ bilayer ] ) should be written as @xmath85 where @xmath86    to find the transmission coefficient through barrier ( [ bar ] ) , one should set @xmath87 for @xmath88 @xmath89 for @xmath90 and satisfy the continuity conditions for both components of the wavefunction and their derivatives .",
    "for the case of an electron beam that is incident normally ( @xmath82 ) and low barriers @xmath91 ( over - barrier transmission ) , we obtain @xmath92 both outside and inside the barrier , and the chirality of fermions in bilayer graphene does not manifest itself . in this case , scattering at the barrier ( [ bar ] ) is the same as for electrons described by the schrdinger equation . however , for any finite @xmath52 ( even in the case @xmath93 ) , waves localized at the barrier interfaces are essential to satisfy the boundary conditions .",
    "the most intriguing behavior is found for @xmath94 , where electrons outside the barrier transform into holes inside it , or vice versa .",
    "examples of the angular dependence of @xmath42 in bilayer graphene are plotted in fig .",
    "[ kleinangular]b .",
    "they show a dramatic difference as compared with the case of massless dirac fermions .",
    "there are again pronounced transmission resonances at some incident angles , where @xmath42 approaches unity .",
    "however , instead of the perfect transmission found for normally - incident dirac fermions ( see fig .",
    "[ kleinangular]a ) , our numerical analysis has yielded the opposite effect : massive chiral fermions are always perfectly reflected for angles close to @xmath82 . at the same time , there is always a `` magic angle '' when the transmission probability is equal to one .",
    "the fact that a barrier ( or even a single @xmath47 junction ) incorporated in a bilayer graphene device should lead to exponentially small tunneling current can be exploited in developing graphene - based field effect transistors ( fet )  @xcite .",
    "such transistors are particularly tempting because of their high mobility and ballistic transport at submicron distances  @xcite .",
    "however , the fundamental problem along this route is that the conducting channel in single - layer graphene can not be pinched off due to the klein paradox ( alternative view on this fact based on the concept of the minimal conductivity will be discussed in the next section ) .",
    "this severely limits achievable on - off ratios for such fets  @xcite and , therefore , the scope for their applications . a bilayer fet with a local gate inverting",
    "the sign of charge carriers should yield much higher on - off ratios .",
    "one of amazing properties of graphene is its finite minimal conductivity which is of the order of the conductance quantum @xmath95 per valley per spin ; it is important to stress that this is the `` quantization '' of conductivity rather than of conductance  @xcite .",
    "this is not only very interesting conceptually but also important in the view of potential applications of graphene for ballistic field - effect transistors  @xcite . at the same time , this phenomenon is intimately related with specifically quantum - relativistic phenomenon known as zitterbewegung  @xcite .    numerous considerations of the conductivity of a two - dimensional massless dirac fermion gas do give this value of the minimal conductivity with accuracy of some factor of the order of unity  @xcite .",
    "it is really surprising that in this case there is a final conductivity for an _ ideal _ crystal , that is , without any scattering processes  @xcite .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian ( [ zero ] ) in the secondary - quantization representation takes the form @xmath96 and the corresponding expression for the current operator @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the momentum and @xmath99 are pseudospinor electron operators .",
    "here we omit spin and valley indices ( so , keeping in mind applications to graphene , the results for the conductivity should be multiplied by 4 due to two spin projections and two valleys ) .",
    "straightforward calculations result in the following time evolution of the electron annihilation operator @xmath100 \\psi _ { \\mathbf{p } }   \\label{second}\\ ] ] and for the current operator @xmath101 \\psi _ { % \\mathbf{p}}e^{2i\\epsilon _ { \\mathbf{p}}t }   \\label{current}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the particle frequency .",
    "the last term in eq.([current ] ) corresponds to the `` zitterbewegung '' , a phenomenon connected with the uncertainty of the position of relativistic quantum particles due to the inevitable creation of particle - antiparticle pairs at the position measurement  @xcite .    to calculate the conductivity @xmath103 following ref .",
    "@xcite we will try first to use the kubo formula  @xcite which reads for two - dimensional isotropic case : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the inverse temperature , @xmath106 is the sample area . in the static limit @xmath107 taking into account the onsager relations and analyticity of the correlators",
    "@xmath108 for @xmath109 one has  @xcite @xmath110 usually , for ideal crystals , the current operator commutes with the hamiltonian and thus @xmath111 does not depend on time . in that case , due to eq.([kubo11 ] ) the frequency - dependent conductivity contains only the drude peak @xmath112 either the spectral weight of the drude peak is finite and , thus , the static conductivity is infinite , or it is equal to zero .",
    "it is easy to check that for the system under consideration the spectral weight of the drude peak is proportional to the modulus of the chemical potential @xmath113 ( cf .",
    "eq.(44 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and thus vanishes at zero doping ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "it is the zitterbewegung , i.e. the oscillating term @xmath115 which is responsible for nontrivial behavior of the conductivity for zero temperature and zero chemical potential ( that is , the case of no charge carriers ) .",
    "a straightforward calculation gives a formal result @xmath116 where one delta - function originates from the integration over @xmath117 in eq.([kubo ] ) and the second one - from the derivative of the fermi distribution function appearing at the calculation of the average over product of fermi - operators .",
    "of course , the square of the delta function is not a well - defined object and thus eq.([sigma ] ) is meaningless before specification of the way how one should regularize the delta - functions .",
    "after regularization the integral in eq.([sigma ] ) is finite , but its value depends on the regularization procedure ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    to circumvent the problem of ambiguity in the expression for @xmath10 in eq.([sigma",
    "] ) it is instructive to follow the alternative landauer approach to calculate the conductivity  @xcite",
    ". let us assume that our sample is the ring of length @xmath118 in @xmath119 direction ; we will use the landauer formula to calculate the conductance in the @xmath53 direction ( see fig .",
    "[ cylindr ] ) .",
    "there is still an uncertainty in the sense that the conductivity turns out to be dependent on the shape of the sample . to have a final transparency we should keep @xmath120 finite . on the other hand , periodic boundary conditions in @xmath119 direction are nonphysical and we have to choose @xmath118 as large as possible to weaken their effects",
    "thus , for two - dimensional situation one should choose @xmath121     ( solid line ) and @xmath122 ( dashed line ) are wave functions of the edge states localized near the top and the bottom of the sample , correspondingly . , width=340 ]    in the coordinate representation the dirac equation at zero energy takes the form @xmath123 where @xmath124 general solutions of these equations are just arbitrary analytical ( or complex conjugated analytical ) functions : @xmath125 due to periodicity in the @xmath119 direction both wave functions should be proportional to @xmath126 where @xmath127 this means that the dependence on @xmath53 is also fixed : the wave functions are proportional to @xmath128 they correspond to the states localized near the bottom and the top of the sample ( see fig .",
    "[ cylindr ] ) .    to use the landauer formula ,",
    "we should introduce boundary conditions at the sample edges ( @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) . to be specific ,",
    "let us assume that the leads are made of doped graphene with the potential @xmath131 and the fermi energy @xmath132 the wave functions in the leads are supposed to have the same @xmath119-dependence , that is , @xmath133 .",
    "thus , one can try the solution of the dirac equation in the following form : @xmath134 where @xmath135 > from the conditions of the continuity of the wave functions , one can find the transmission coefficient @xmath136 furthermore , one should assume that @xmath137 and put @xmath138 in eq.([t1 ] ) .",
    "thus , the trace of the transparency which is just the conductance ( in units of @xmath95 ) is @xmath139 assuming that the conductance is equal to @xmath140 one finds the contribution to the conductivity equal to @xmath141 .",
    "experimentally  @xcite , it is close to @xmath95 , that is , roughly , three times larger than this estimation .",
    "this discrepancy known as a `` missed pi(e ) problem '' is still not solved .",
    "one should stress that this is the gapless character of the spectrum and the chirality rather than the linear dispersion relation which lead to the minimal conductivity .",
    "different estimations for the bilayer graphene give the same order of magnitude for the conductivity  @xcite , in agreement with experimenatl observations  @xcite .",
    "another approach to qualitative understanding of the minimal conductivity is based on the klein paradox  @xcite . in conventional 2d systems ,",
    "strong enough disorder results in electronic states that are separated by barriers with exponentially small transparency  @xcite .",
    "this is known to lead to the anderson localization .",
    "in contrast , in both graphene materials all potential barriers are relatively transparent ( @xmath142 at least for some angles ) which does not allow charge carriers to be confined by potential barriers that are smooth on an atomic scale",
    ". therefore , different electron and hole `` puddles '' induced by disorder are not isolated but effectively percolate , thereby suppressing localization . in the absence of the localization , a standard mott estimation of the minimal conductivity assuming that the mean - free path can not be smaller that electron wave - length  @xcite immediately gives the minimal conductivity @xmath143  @xcite .",
    "the anomalous qhe in graphene  @xcite is probably the most striking demonstration of the massless character of the charge carrier spectrum in graphene . in two - dimensional systems with a constant magnetic field",
    "@xmath144 perpendicular to the system plane the energy spectrum is discrete ( landau quantization ) . for the case of massless",
    "dirac fermions the energy spectrum takes the form  @xcite @xmath145 where @xmath2 is the electron velocity , @xmath146 is the quantum number and the term with @xmath147 is connected to the chirality .",
    "just to remind that in the usual case of the parabolic dispersion relation the landau level sequence is @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the frequency of electron rotation in magnetic field ( cyclotron frequency )  @xcite .",
    "an important peculiarity of landau levels for massless dirac fermions is the existence of zero - energy states ( with @xmath150 and the minus sign in equation ( [ landaulevel ] ) ) .",
    "this situation differs fundamentally from usual semiconductors with parabolic bands where the first landau level is shifted by @xmath151 .",
    "the existence of the zero - energy landau level leads to an anomalous qhe with _ half - integer _ quantization of the hall conductivity , instead of the _ integer _ one ( for a review of the qhe , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "usually , all landau levels have the same degeneracy ( a number of electron states with a given energy ) which is just proportional to a magnetic flux through the system . as a result ,",
    "plateaus in the hall conductivity corresponding to the filling of the first @xmath152 levels are just integer ( in units of the conductance quant @xmath95 ) . for the case of massless dirac electrons ,",
    "the zero - energy landau level has twice smaller degeneracy than any other level ( it corresponds to the minus sign in the equation ( 1 ) whereas the energy level proportional to @xmath153 with integer @xmath154 are obtained twice , for @xmath155 and minus sign , and for @xmath156 and plus sign ) .",
    "a discovery of this `` half - integer qhe ''  @xcite was the most direct evidence of the dirac fermions in graphene .    a deeper view on the origin of the zero - energy landau level and thus the anomalous qhe is provided by the famous atiyah - singer index theorem which plays an important role in the modern quantum field theory and theory of superstrings  @xcite .",
    "the dirac equation has a charge - conjugation symmetry between electrons and holes .",
    "this means that for any electron state with a positive energy @xmath11 a corresponding conjugated hole state with the energy @xmath12 should exist .",
