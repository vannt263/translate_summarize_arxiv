    "a quantum computer would possess the fascinating ability to perform certain computational tasks exponentially faster than classical computers , by nontrivially using the exponentially large size of a many - body quantum hilbert space .",
    "@xcite semiconductor quantum dot spin systems are one of the leading candidates for building a quantum computer because of their prospective scalability,@xcite their long coherence times,@xcite and their capacity for fast all - electrical gate operations.@xcite there are various ways to encode quantum information in the spin states of electrons loaded into one or more quantum dots . for example , the two spin states of a single electron can form a qubit;@xcite alternatively a qubit may also be encoded in the collective spin states of two@xcite or three electrons.@xcite in this paper , we focus on the case of the singlet - triplet qubit,@xcite where the qubit is encoded in the singlet - triplet spin subspace of two electrons trapped in a double quantum dot .",
    "this encoding scheme has the advantages of fast single - qubit operations and of being immune to homogenous fluctuations of the magnetic field .",
    "arbitrary single - qubit operations are performed by combining @xmath3-axis rotations around the bloch sphere , achieved by a tunable exchange interaction between the singlet and triplet states,@xcite and @xmath4-axis rotations , which are generated by a local magnetic field gradient.@xcite together with an entangling two - qubit gate , which can be based on either a capacitive coupling@xcite between the two qubits or an exchange coupling,@xcite one is then able to perform universal quantum computation .",
    "the great advantage of the singlet - triplet quantum dot spin qubits , leading to substantial experimental and theoretical activities in the topic , is that the qubit operations can all be implemented by external electric fields ( i.e. suitable gate voltages ) , thus making them operationally convenient as well as compatible with existing semiconductor electronics .",
    "one of the biggest obstacles to the realization of a quantum computer is the qubit decoherence that results from the interaction between the qubits and their environment .",
    "this decoherence must be very small for successful quantum computation to work , and the central problem of the whole field has been the issue of whether it is experimentally feasible to reduce decoherence to a level low enough for fault - tolerant quantum computation to go forward  in particular , the decoherence must be very small both during the idling of the gates ( i.e. when the qubits are just quantum memory ) and during the actual gate operations .",
    "there are two main noise channels for singlet - triplet qubits leading to decoherence : overhauser noise , which stems from the hyperfine - mediated spin flip - flop processes that take place between the electron spins and the nuclear spins in the surrounding substrate,@xcite and charge noise arising from environmental voltage fluctuation , which corresponds to the deformation of the quantum dot confinement potential due to nearby impurities or other sources of uncontrolled stray electric fields.@xcite fortunately , these types of noise are highly non - markovian : they produce stochastic errors in the qubit hamiltonian which vary on a much longer time scale ( @xmath5s ) than typical gate operation times ( on the scale of ns ) .",
    "dynamical decoupling has proven to be a successful method for combating this kind of noise .",
    "its underlying idea is the `` self - compensation '' of errors , best illustrated by the hahn spin echo technique introduced first in the context of nmr:@xcite when a quantum state dephases due to noise over some time span , one may apply a @xmath6-pulse to flip the sign of the error in the state , effectively reversing the error s evolution so that the qubit `` refocuses '' to its original state after a second time span of equal duration to the first . here",
    "it is very important that the noise is non - markovian since one requires the noise to remain static over the time spans before and after the @xmath6-pulse .",
    "this dynamical way of reviving a quantum state has proven invaluable to coherent manipulation of quantum systems , as have several more sophisticated pulse sequences that were subsequently developed@xcite and implemented in experiments.@xcite in general , dynamical decoupling extends the coherence time from the dephasing time @xmath7 to a much longer timescale @xmath8 ( which is defined depending on the specific dynamical decoupling sequence used ) beyond which the quantum information is inevitably lost . for singlet - triplet spin qubits in gaas quantum dots ,",
    "@xmath9 ns and @xmath10 ms,@xcite while for si @xmath11 ns@xcite and @xmath10 ms@xcite but is expected to be even longer in isotope - enriched samples.@xcite therefore , dynamical decoupling is a powerful way to preserve a quantum state against noise , enabling robust quantum memory .    achieving robust quantum memory capabilities , however , covers only one of the requirements for a viable quantum computer .",
    "equally necessary is the ability to protect the qubit from noise _ while _ performing quantum gates on it .",
    "this necessity has motivated the development of dynamically corrected gates ( dcgs),@xcite which can roughly be thought of as an extension of dynamical decoupling to the situation where the qubit is simultaneously being purposefully rotated .",
    "in particular , dcgs also typically exploit the notion of self - canceling errors . like dynamical decoupling ,",
    "such protocols have been vastly successful in nmr and in the general theory of quantum control",
    ". however , in contrast to dynamical decoupling , most approaches to dcgs developed thus far in the literature are not applicable to the case of singlet - triplet qubits because of their unique experimental constraints .",
    "first , the tunable exchange interaction which gives rise to @xmath3-axis rotations is always non - negative and bounded from above by a certain maximal value.@xcite second , in order to do arbitrary single - qubit rotations , one must set up a magnetic field gradient@xcite across the two quantum dots ; this gradient can not be varied during gate operations , meaning that the control is effectively single - axis ( along @xmath3 ) and that there is an always - on field rotating the qubit states into each other .",
    "either constraint by itself would already rule out many dcg schemes ; together , these constraints make noise - resistant control in singlet - triplet qubits uniquely challenging . in particular , the spectacular pulse control techniques developed in the nmr literature over many years are useless for our purpose since nmr does not satisfy the special constraints discussed above , and we must start from scratch and develop dcg pulses for the singlet - triplet qubits obeying the special constraints of the problem .",
    "despite these challenges , it was realized recently that it is still possible to develop dcgs for singlet - triplet qubits subject to static noise . in ref .",
    ", we introduced supcode ( soft uniaxial positive control for orthogonal drift error ) , demonstrating that it is possible to design special sequences of square pulses that implement robust quantum gates while at the same time respecting all experimental constraints .",
    "supcode was originally introduced to cancel errors due to overhauser noise only . in the case of a non - zero magnetic field gradient",
    ", we showed how to cancel the leading - order effect of overhauser noise by supplementing a nave pulse with an uncorrected identity operation , designed in such a way that the errors accumulated during the identity operation exactly cancel the errors arising during the nave pulse .",
    "we further showed that by performing the identity operations as interrupted @xmath12 rotations around certain axes of the bloch sphere , error cancelation is always possible since one has the flexibility to include as many degrees of freedom as necessary for the cancelation simply by including more interruptions .",
    "the cost one has to pay is that the error - correcting pulse is typically substantially longer than the nave pulse . for the cases discussed in ref .",
    ", more than @xmath13 of rotation around the bloch sphere is required for an error - correcting pulse .",
    "a long pulse sequence is an essential price to pay for carrying out error - corrected dcg operations in quantum computation , but the pulse time can be optimized through careful calculations .",
    "this idea of correcting a nave pulse by supplementing it with an identity operation formed by nested @xmath12 rotations was further developed and optimized in ref .  .",
    "there , we showed that arbitrary single - qubit rotations can be made resistant to both overhauser and charge noise simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that the pulse sequence duration can be reduced by a factor of @xmath14 from the previous work , ref .",
    ", even though the sequences cancel both types of noise , not just overhauser noise , greatly increasing the experimental feasibility of these sequences .",
    "subsequently , alternative approaches to dcgs for canceling both types of noise in singlet - triplet qubits have appeared in the literature.@xcite    in ref .",
    ", we also showed that supcode can be extended to construct robust two - qubit exchange gates based on the inter - qubit exchange - coupling , and that it is again possible to protect against both overhauser and charge noise .",
    "the design of a robust two - qubit gate is considerably more complicated because of the presence of additional errors that do not arise in the single - qubit case , including possible leakage error out of the computational subspace as well as the over - rotation error in the two - qubit ising gate caused by charge noise .",
    "nevertheless we have shown that these obstacles can be circumvented when single - qubit supcode gates are combined in a manner similar to the bb1 sequence developed in nmr.@xcite unfortunately , the resulting sequence is relatively long ( about @xmath15 of rotation ) and is challenging for actual implementation in the laboratory . the task then remains to reduce the length of the pulse sequence while maintaining its robustness against noise .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to bridge the gap between the theory of supcode and its experimental implementation . as in the development of any theory , we have made several simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , it is generally the case that the qubit exchange coupling is controlled by the tilt , or detuning , of the double quantum dot confinement potential .",
    "this allows the experimenter to control the qubit by adjusting voltages , but it also makes the qubit vulnerable to charge noise .",
    "furthermore , the effect of charge noise on the qubit will generally depend on the precise dependence of the exchange coupling on the detuning . in our previous works",
    ", we have mostly assumed a phenomenological relation between the exchange coupling @xmath16 and detuning @xmath17 : @xmath18 , a form used in previous works.@xcite however , this phenomenological form is non - universal , and in practice @xmath19 varies from sample to sample .",
    "it is therefore an important question to ask whether supcode would still work for other charge noise models in which @xmath19 has a different form .",
    "second , we have assumed that the pulses are perfect square pulses which are turned on and off instantaneously . in actual experiments ,",
    "the pulses have finite rise times , and in ref .",
    ", we have shown that inclusion of the finite rise time would only amount to a shift in pulse parameters but otherwise leave our major results unchanged for the original supcode .",
    "the question remains whether the same holds for the more powerful yet shorter sequences presented in ref .  .",
    "in this paper , we explicitly examine these experimental considerations and show that the power of supcode sequences is not compromised by the extra complications of real systems .",
    "we further clarify how one could slightly modify the pulse parameters of the two - qubit gate in order to accommodate different charge noise models .",
    "moreover , we show that the length of the corrected two - qubit gates can be reduced by as much as 35% from that shown in ref .  , a significant step toward future experimental implementation .",
    "we believe that the optimized dcg pulse sequence proposed in the current article are ready for immediate implementation in the laboratory spin qubit experiments .",
    "most crucially , in the previous works we have assumed a static noise model .",
    "such a model captures the essence of the quasi - static noise found in actual experiments,@xcite and the basic idea is that in such realistic situations , performing a supcode sequence would echo away most , although not all , of the effect of the noise . in this paper",
    ", we test this idea by performing randomized benchmarking of the 24 single - qubit clifford gates , all found through our supcode framework , under @xmath0 noise , where @xmath1 is a parameter that depends on the physical processes causing the noise .",
    "we show that unlike for static noise , in this case there is a limit to the amount of improvement possible via supcode , but that this limit depends strongly on @xmath1 and substantial benefit from supcode is available for the case where @xmath2 .",
    "the results we present in this paper show that supcode is a powerful tool that can perform noise - resistant quantum gates despite the complications of real spin qubit systems , including different dependencies between the exchange coupling and the detuning , finite rise times and realistic @xmath0 noise sources . for these reasons",
    ", we believe that supcode will be immensely helpful to on - going experimental efforts in performing quantum gates on semiconductor quantum dot devices .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we present the theoretical model , explain the experimental constraints and the basic assumptions that we have made . in sec .",
    "[ sec : oneqrot ] we give a very detailed and pedagogical review of how supcode sequences are constructed for an arbitrary single - qubit rotation .",
    "explicit examples of several quantum gates are also presented , including the 24 single - qubit clifford gates which are used in the randomized benchmarking in sec .",
    "[ sec : benchmarking ] .",
    "we discuss how different charge noise models and finite rise times would affect our supcode sequences in sec .",
    "[ sec : altgofj ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : finiterisetime ] , respectively . in sec .",
    "[ sec : twoq ] we show that the length of the corrected two - qubit gate presented in ref .   can be significantly reduced in duration by about 35% .",
    "we also show how the pulse parameters are minimally altered for a general charge noise model . following this",
    ", we discuss the noise - resistant manipulation of a multi - qubit system using single - qubit and two - qubit corrected gates presented in this paper and the buffering identity operation required to accomplish this task .",
    "we present randomized benchmarking results in sec .",
    "[ sec : benchmarking ] .",
    "finally we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the model hamiltonian for a singlet - triplet qubit can be expressed in terms of the pauli operators @xmath20 as @xmath21}{2}\\sigma_z.\\ ] ] the computational bases are @xmath22 and @xmath23 . here , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 creates an electron with spin @xmath26 at the @xmath27th dot .",
    "any linear combinations of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 states can be represented as a unit vector pointing towards a specific point on the bloch sphere , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 its north and south poles , respectively .",
    "being able to perform arbitrary single qubit operations then amounts to being able to rotate such a unit vector  the bloch vector  from any point to any other point on the bloch sphere .",
    "this capability combined with an entangling two - qubit gate , such as the cnot gate , suffices to achieve universal quantum computation .",
    "geometrically , one needs the ability to rotate around two non - parallel axes of the bloch sphere in order to complete an arbitrary rotation . in this system ,",
    "rotations around the @xmath4-axis are performed with a magnetic field gradient across the double - dot system , which in energy units reads @xmath30 . in practice the magnetic field gradient is generated either by dynamically polarizing the nuclear spins surrounding the double dots@xcite ( the `` overhauser field '' ) , or by depositing a permanent micromagnet nearby.@xcite in principle , the magnetic field gradient can be changed , and thus also the rotation rate around the @xmath4-axis .",
    "unfortunately , changing it requires times much longer than the gate operation time .",
    "therefore we assume that in performing a given computational task , the magnetic field gradient , @xmath31 , is held constant throughout .",
    "rotations around the @xmath3-axis are done by virtue of the exchange interaction @xmath16 , the energy level splitting between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "a nice feature of the quantum dot system is that the magnitude of @xmath16 can be controlled by the detuning @xmath17 , namely the tilt of the effective double - well confinement potential , which in turn can be done by simply changing the gate voltages . in other words , by feeding in a series of carefully designed pulses to the control gates , one then has fast , all - electrical control of the rotation rate around the @xmath3-axis .",
    "however , due to its intrinsic energy level structure,@xcite @xmath16 is bounded from below by zero , and from above by a certain maximal value @xmath34 , beyond which the tunneling between quantum dots becomes large enough to alter the charge configuration of the electrons .",
    "( in certain extreme conditions such as very high magnetic fields , @xmath16 is always negative .",
    "this does not change our argument since @xmath16 can not change its sign . )",
    "we emphasize here that it is this unique constraint , @xmath35\\le j_{\\rm max}$ ] which renders the numerous compensating pulses developed in nmr literature inapplicable to this system .",
    "we also remark that although a pure @xmath3-axis rotation may be done by holding @xmath36 and @xmath16 constant , this is not desirable since one then loses access to universal control .",
    "this special case has been discussed in ref .  , and in the following we will assume @xmath37 , and a composite pulse is needed to perform @xmath3-axis rotations even without noise . for details , see sec .",
    "[ sec : zrot ] .",
    "( @xmath31 and @xmath16 need not have the same sign .",
    "we assume @xmath37 only for convenience ; our method applies equally well to the case of @xmath38 .",
    "the only important thing is @xmath31 has to be a non - zero constant and @xmath16 has a definite sign . )",
    "rotations around both @xmath4- and @xmath3-axes are subject to decoherence .",
    "on one hand , fluctuations in the overhauser field , for example the spin flip - flop induced by hyperfine interactions , add a small , but unknown error term @xmath39 to the hamiltonian : @xmath40 .",
    "on the other hand , the charge noise , caused by electrons hopping on and off impurity sites near the quantum dots , leads to deformation of the confinement potential and in turn the energy level structure . as a consequence",
    ", errors will be introduced on the energy splitting between the singlet and triplet states , which we label by @xmath41 .",
    "this effect can alternatively be referred to as the control noise .    to treat these errors",
    ", we make a few assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that the control noise @xmath41 and the magnetic field fluctuations @xmath39 are uncorrelated , namely they are two independent sources of error .",
    "second , we assume that @xmath41 is completely caused by the fluctuations in the detuning , @xmath42",
    ". therefore , @xmath43 = \\delta \\epsilon \\left .",
    "\\frac{\\partial j\\left(\\epsilon\\right)}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right|_{\\epsilon = \\epsilon\\left(t\\right)}=g(j)\\delta\\epsilon,\\label{eq : djdef}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a shorthand notation for @xmath45 evaluated at the detuning that produces exchange @xmath16 .",
    "third , the strong non - markovian feature of the noises @xmath39 and @xmath46 allows us to assume that they are constant , albeit unknown , for the duration of a quantum gate .",
    "this last assumption is crucial since even dynamical decoupling would be impossible for completely white noise , and it is indeed the long time scale over which the noise varies compared to the very fast quantum gate operation times that allows us to perform corrected rotations . for a discussion of how our method works in the scenario where this third assumption is lifted , see sec .",
    "[ sec : benchmarking ] .    although the exact dependencies of @xmath16 on the detuning @xmath17 vary from sample to sample , an experimental fit gives the phenomenological dependence @xmath47 , implying @xmath48.@xcite to facilitate our theoretical treatment , we will assume this form for @xmath19 for most of the results given in this work .",
    "however , in sec .",
    "[ sec : altgofj ] we explicitly demonstrate that our method can easily accommodate other forms for @xmath44 .",
    "we further assume that the pulses are square `` boxcar '' pulses with zero rise time , again for simplicity .",
    "however , in sec .",
    "[ sec : finiterisetime ] , we show that our method continues to work well even in the case of finite rise times .",
    "as discussed above , an ( uncorrected ) rotation by angle @xmath50 around the @xmath4-axis can be achieved by holding @xmath51 at zero for a time @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , holding @xmath51 at a constant value @xmath53 would produce a rotation around the axis @xmath54 . in the presence of both noise sources , such a rotation , which we denote by @xmath55 ,",
    "has the form @xmath56}\\notag \\\\ & = \\exp{\\left[-i\\left(\\frac{h}{2 } \\sigma_x + \\frac{j}{2 } \\sigma_z\\right)\\frac{\\phi}{\\sqrt{h^2+j^2}}\\right]}\\left(i - i\\sum_k\\delta_k \\sigma_k \\right)\\notag\\\\ & \\equiv r(j,\\phi)\\left(i - i\\sum_k\\delta_k \\sigma_k \\right),\\label{eq : ujphi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum on @xmath57 runs through @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the desired ( noiseless ) operation . for convenience",
    ", we also define the ideal rotation by angle @xmath50 around an axis defined by the vector @xmath60 as @xmath61 so that @xmath62 .",
    "although this is perhaps a slight abuse of notation , it will prove very convenient .",
    "to first order in @xmath39 and @xmath41 , the error terms @xmath63 are@xcite    @xmath64    since @xmath31 is assumed to be held constant for the entire computation , we take @xmath65 as our energy unit for the remainder of the paper .    our aim is to design a series of these pulses in such a way that the sum of all the error terms from each pulse equals zero . our strategy , as shown in our previous works on supcode,@xcite is to supplement the `` nave '' , uncorrected pulse of eq .   with a carefully chosen ( uncorrected ) identity operation @xmath66 , which has error @xmath67 such that the composite pulse @xmath68 is immune to the leading - order noise , namely , @xmath69 for @xmath70 up to first order in @xmath39 and @xmath41 [ the meaning of the superscript @xmath71 will become clear later ] .",
    "to design such an identity , one typically needs to figure out the @xmath72 values corresponding to a given sequence and solve the coupled algebraic equations , @xmath69 ( which are typically nonlinear ) , to get the parameters that define the pulse sequence .",
    "this means that we need identities that contain a sufficient number of parameters such that there exist solutions to these equations .",
    "there are infinitely many ways to perform an identity operation , but what we found most convenient is the interrupted @xmath12 rotations @xcite , comprised of a @xmath12 rotation interrupted by a @xmath12 rotation about a different axis . in ref .  , we present such an identity as @xmath73 where @xmath74 are integers , and @xmath75 and @xmath76 are non - negative real numbers as required by the experimental constraints .",
    "we refer to eq .   as a `` level-@xmath77 '' identity .",
    "this sequence of pulses is essentially a @xmath78 rotation around axis @xmath79 , interrupted by a @xmath80 rotation around another axis determined by @xmath81 , with @xmath82 indicating the location of the interruption .",
    "the latter is , in turn , interrupted again by a @xmath83 rotation .",
    "this construction has several advantages .",
    "on one hand , it is guaranteed that in the absence of noise , this sequence becomes an exact identity . on the other hand",
    ", it makes searching for physically meaningful solutions easier because it allows for infinitely many degrees of freedom . in practice",
    ", one should start with a simpler identity . in principle , six parameters are all one would need to satisfy the noise cancelation conditions .",
    "however , due to the non - linearity of the equations , it is not guaranteed that the solutions are real and non - negative as required .",
    "when solutions are not found , one simply adds a level to acquire more tunable parameters .",
    "therefore , this construction offers sufficient freedom that noise cancelation is always possible for all cases we studied , as will be explicitly demonstrated below .    with these comments , we can now outline the general procedure for generating pulse sequences corrected up to first order in the noise :    1 .   determine the rotation @xmath84 to be implemented .",
    "the pulses discussed in this section require @xmath85 to be proportional to @xmath86 , i.e. @xmath87 , for a certain physically allowed value of @xmath16 .",
    "2 .   find the nave pulse , @xmath55 [ eq .  ] and its first order error terms @xmath88 .",
    "3 .   start with an uncorrected identity , say a level-3 identity @xmath89 which has at least six parameters ( @xmath90 through @xmath91 , @xmath92 through @xmath93 ) .",
    "fix extra parameters such as @xmath94 through @xmath95 and one of the @xmath27 and @xmath96 parameters , making the total number of unknowns six . again",
    "find the first order error terms @xmath97 .",
    "however , here the coefficients @xmath98 and @xmath99 must contain six unknown parameters to be determined at the next stage .",
    "4 .   solve the six coupled equations @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "if one has the desired solution ( namely , all @xmath76 and angles @xmath75 are non - negative real numbers ) , then the procedure is finished .",

    "-axis for a range of angles , corresponding to the sequence shown in eq .   with @xmath102 .",
    "note that @xmath103 and @xmath91 have been rescaled by a factor of 20 to fall into approximately the same range as the other parameters . in solving for these parameters",
    ", we have assumed @xmath104.,width=302 ]    there remain a few remarks to make .",
    "first , there are several ways to generate @xmath105 as functions of the pulse parameters .",
    "one may directly do a matrix multiplication , with all error terms analytically or numerically expressed for each trial solution to the equations .",
    "however a way we find most convenient in practice is to make use of the recursive nature of the identity design.@xcite in other words , one may generate @xmath106 from @xmath107 ( @xmath70 ) , corresponding to level-@xmath77 and @xmath108 identities , while @xmath109 is known trivially .",
    "this typically eliminates the need for matrix multiplication , which leads to savings in computation time especially when the sequences become long .",
    "secondly , one does not always have to solve for six unknowns . by applying `` symmetric pulses '' from @xmath110 through @xmath111 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath112 , one only needs to determine four unknown parameters since the coefficient of @xmath113 is guaranteed to vanish,@xcite as shown below .",
    "this applies to rotations by any angle around an axis lying within the @xmath4-@xmath3 plane , which is obviously the case for what we study in this subsection . to see why the @xmath113 component completely vanishes ,",
    "consider that @xmath114 note that on the right hand side of eq .",
    ", @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 are arbitrary complex numbers , and there is no @xmath113 term .",
    "then , simple algebra reveals that given any operators @xmath118 and @xmath119 of the type of eq .   with arbitrary coefficients",
    ", @xmath120 can also be written in such a form , free of @xmath113 terms . applying this statement recursively to the time evolution for the entire sequence",
    ", one immediately sees that for any @xmath51 satisfying @xmath112 , the resulting evolution operator @xmath121 does not contain a @xmath113 component .",
    "we are now ready to discuss how to correct a one - piece rotation , defined in eq .  , with supcode .",

    "we have found that a level-5 identity has enough degrees of freedom to cancel the noise .",
    "of course , there are other identities which do the same job ; we choose the particular identity shown in eq .   only for the sake of concreteness .",
    "the next step is to find a way to make the entire pulse sequence `` symmetric '' .",

    "in this section , we discuss two - qubit gates as well as how to perform a noise - resistant operation on a multi - qubit array . for this purpose",

    "then we proceed to show how one can make this gate robust against noise , and how the entire sequence may be optimized .",
    "the fundamental ingredient in performing a two - qubit gate with an exchange coupling is the ising gate , labeled by @xmath199 , which is designed in such a way that in the absence of noise , leakage to the undesired states @xmath200 and @xmath201 is prevented , and one is left with a state - dependent phase due to the exchange pulse.@xcite the pulse sequence reads @xmath202 and is also shown schematically in fig .",

    "during a single application of @xmath205 , the overhauser fields also contribute to the phase accumulated by the two - qubit states , however , these may be removed by flipping all the spins in qubits @xmath197 and @xmath198 ( the effect of the swap gates ) then applying the @xmath205 again , by which an equal amount of phase with opposite sign is accumulated through the overhauser field .",
    "the swap gates on qubits @xmath197 and @xmath198 are applied for this purpose .",

    "noise has two effects on the ising gate .",
    "first , imperfect single - qubit rotations produce errors in the swap gates and the @xmath212 gates , which , in the former cases contribute to decoherence and in the latter cases cause leakage out of the computational subspace in addition to decoherence .",
    "these errors can be corrected up to the first order by replacing all single - qubit gates by the supcode sequences discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : oneqrot ] .",
    "what makes the noise correction difficult is that the charge noise makes @xmath213 , and subsequently the phase @xmath1 , erroneous .",
    "worse , supcode typically sweeps more than @xmath214 around the bloch sphere , during which a considerable amount of error may be accumulated .",
    "since this problem is not solved by replacing all gates by supcode , we must deal with it differently .    in ref .",
    "we propose a way to correct the phase error due to the charge noise by making an analogy to the bb1 sequence , which is known to correct the over - rotation error in nmr literature.@xcite in fact , although bb1 was originally proposed to correct over - rotation error for single - qubit gates , it was later realized @xcite that for the ising two - qubit gate , a variant of the same sequence would work .",
    "we will therefore start with the single - qubit version of the bb1 sequence , and then verify whether that sequence can correct the over - rotation error as desired .",

    "our sequence will work perfectly as long as one chooses the @xmath232 value as in eq .  .",
    "here we made no assumption about the precise form of @xmath44 : the only important thing is that @xmath44 has to be known and the values of @xmath270 and @xmath271 can be calculated .",
    "since we now have corrected single - qubit and two - qubit gates , arbitrary multi - qubit circuits immune to noise can be performed in a similar manner as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bb1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : sk1 ] .",
    "there remains one more component essential for implementing a multi - qubit circuit : a variable - time identity operation .",
    "in fact , the identity operation plays important roles in several parts of our pulse sequence , which we explain in detail below .",
    "first , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : bb1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : sk1 ] , when qubit @xmath197 is undergoing a single - qubit operation , for example a @xmath3-rotation , qubit @xmath198 has to undergo a corrected identity operation .",
    "one can not simply do nothing on qubit @xmath198 because the constant presence of the overhauser field required to access the @xmath4-axis rotation would lead the qubit states to stray undesirably , and the situation is made worse by the presence of noise . therefore it is necessary for qubit @xmath198 to undergo a corrected identity operation which has the same time duration as the operation performed on qubit @xmath197 , namely they must both end at the same time and proceed to the next operation .",
    "the same holds for multi - qubit gates : when several qubits as part of a qubit array are performing certain operations , all remaining qubits must perform identity operations , and these operations should all have the same time duration .",
    "if the operations on two qubits have different time durations ( say @xmath272 and @xmath273 ) , then one must supplement those operations with identity operations with time durations @xmath274 and @xmath275 to make them end at the same time , while the remaining qubits must also end their respective operations at time @xmath194 .",
    "this is necessary to keep the entire system immune to noise to the leading order .",
    "for example , in the ising gate as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bb1](a ) , both qubits @xmath197 and @xmath198 have to perform a swap operation , @xmath276 .",
    "they would automatically span the same time if the overhauser fields for qubits @xmath197 and @xmath198 are identical .",
    "however when the overhauser fields are different , the two operations would end at different times and one must `` buffer '' them by identities as explained above .    secondly , the identity operation is also fundamental for two - qubit gates : it is an essential ingredient for performing @xmath277 [ cf .",
    "eq .   and fig .",
    "[ fig : bb1](a ) ] . in the definition of @xmath212 ,",
    "the argument @xmath209 is equal to @xmath213 , which then directly translates to the resulting ising gate @xmath222 . here , @xmath278 is a composite pulse implementing an identity operation in the @xmath207 subspace of dots 2 and 3 , therefore generating @xmath254 for a certain value of @xmath1 amounts to doing an identity operation with @xmath279 matching a predetermined value .",
    "the above discussion implies that we need a family of corrected identity operations which can generate a broad range of time durations as well as values of @xmath279 . to accomplish this",
    ", we employ an additional degree of freedom in the discussion of sec .",
    "[ sec : onepiece ] , the exchange interaction @xmath16 .",
    "note that for each value of @xmath16 , one can always perform a corrected @xmath12 rotation around @xmath86 with a certain time @xmath194 and value of @xmath279 .",
    "when @xmath16 is changed between @xmath280 and @xmath34 , @xmath194 and @xmath279 would also change , covering certain ranges .",
    "we have found such an identity as a level-6 one , defined as @xmath281 since the sequence is symmetric , we only need four unknowns .",
    "we then choose @xmath161 , and use @xmath16 as the `` tunable knob '' : for each given value of @xmath16 , we solve for physical solutions of @xmath90 , @xmath103 , @xmath91 , @xmath282 , and record the time duration and @xmath283 .",
    "we have found that the pulse sequence of eq .   generates identity operations with time duration @xmath284 between @xmath285 and @xmath286 . by duplicating this identity ,",
    "one can obtain corrected identities spanning any time for @xmath287 .",
    "these identity operations can also be used in the construction of the two - qubit gates discussed in previous sections .",

    "the crucial insight of rb is that instead of investigating arbitrary gates , we may restrict ourselves to a finite subset , the clifford group .",
    "this means that we need only produce a finite set of corrected gates .",
    "also , we can efficiently calculate the effect of any arbitrary sequence of ideal clifford gates acting on a state .",
    "additionally , after any arbitrary sequence of clifford gates applied to the system ground state @xmath28 , only 1 additional , efficiently - calculable , clifford gate is required to rotate the resulting state into the standard @xmath28-@xmath29 measurement basis .",
    "this last property is crucial for the experimental implementation of rb , allowing errors in the clifford gates to be determined independently of any errors in state preparation and measurement ( spam ) .",
    "we have investigated the theoretical performance of our single - qubit gates using a numerical simulation of randomized benchmarking .",
    "we denote the set of 24 single - qubit cliffords as @xmath306 , and similarly denote a pulse implementation of the group ( which may be a nave uncorrected implementation , or one of our corrected supcode composite pulse implementations as given explicitly in tables [ tab : numericonepiece ]  to  [ tab : genpulsepara ] and shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : fignaiv ] ) as @xmath307 .",
    "we can calculate the expected fidelity of an implementation of a length-@xmath77 sequence of cliffords as @xmath308 where @xmath309 denotes the fidelity between unitaries @xmath197 and @xmath198 , and the bracket @xmath310 represents averaging over both the choice of random clifford elements @xmath311 distributed uniformly and independently over @xmath312 and also averaging over realizations of the charge and magnetic field noise , parameterized by an amplitude @xmath300 .",
    "we generate `` @xmath313 '' noise realizations via a weighted sum of random telegraph signals  ( rtss)@xcite , resulting in noise that approximates a desired @xmath303 power spectrum over a wide range in @xmath314 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figoverf ] .",
    "we choose the low - frequency cutoff such that the slowest rts has time constant @xmath315 and the high - frequency cutoff from @xmath316 .",
    "one interpretation of a low - frequency cutoff is that it corresponds to the experimentalist making a calibration of @xmath31 and @xmath16 on a timescale of @xmath317 prior to a given benchmarking run . as such",
    ", our choice of @xmath317 minimizes the relative improvement due to supcode , since it corresponds to calibrating out @xmath41 and @xmath39 about as quickly as is reasonable to imagine : more usually @xmath317 will be on the order of minutes or hours ( @xmath318 ) leading to a much larger dc component of the noise and correspondingly better performance of supcode compared to nave pulses .",
    "our high - frequency cutoff is on the order of the shortest pulses of our sequences , such that all higher frequencies are effectively `` white '' : extending the cutoff towards higher frequencies should be equivalent to adding a white noise background that will affect the nave and corrected pulses similarly , depending only on their total duration .    both",
    "because the nave and corrected pulse sequences are built from piecewise - constant pulses and because the noise realizations are also piecewise - constant , the system evolution can be efficiently calculated as a product of matrix exponentials .",
    "this gives an efficient calculation of the expected fidelity @xmath319 .",
    "we proceed in the standard way for rb by fitting @xmath319 for differing @xmath320 to a decaying exponential function @xmath321 , where unlike in the case of experimental rb we are able to avoid fitting an overall scaling factor , due to absence of spam errors for this numerical simulation . due to the non - markovian form of the noise ,",
    "@xmath319 is not necessarily expected to have exactly exponential form , and indeed we do observe a deviation from the exponential in fig .  [",
    "fig : figdcexp ] .",
    "nevertheless we use the fitted @xmath296 [ which can be related to an error - per - gate ( epg)@xcite ] to summarize the performance of a particular implementation of the clifford group under a particular noise distribution .",
    "when the strength of the noise is reduced , we find that , as expected , the epg of a supcode clifford implementation falls more steeply than for a nave implementation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figdjdh ] ) .",
    "for static noise , the @xmath296 for supcode is @xmath299 order in the noise strength , @xmath300 , compared to @xmath322 order for the nave implementation , allowing the supcode to perform arbitrarily better than the nave sequence , if the noise can be reduced sufficiently .",
    "however , for colored noise , the ratio of the nave @xmath323 to the supcode @xmath324 saturates to a finite value , @xmath325 , in the limit that the noise is reduced toward zero , @xmath326 .",
    "thus , there is a maximum improvement that is possible for supcode .",
    "we find that this ratio is a strong function of the exponent @xmath1 of the noise distribution , and over the range @xmath327 it fits well to an exponential function @xmath328 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figratio ] , where @xmath329 ) .",
    "( to study @xmath1 much outside this range , we would need to use a different process to generate the noise . )",
    "the specific value of the base varies , @xmath330 , when sweeping the low- and high - frequency cutoffs of the noise spectrum over a factor of 10 , but the sensitivity to @xmath1 remains .",
    "based on this empirical result and the experimental estimates of @xmath1 , it seems that supcode should perform extremely well against magnetic field noise , but have more limited success against charge noise .",
    "this assumes the experimental estimates of @xmath1 for these noises turn out to hold true , and comes with the caveat that a sum of rtss can not reproduce a noise spectrum with @xmath331 where a spin - diffusion model is more physically realistic .",
    "a future variant of supcode might trade a fraction of the performance against field noise for improved performance against charge noise .",
    "our numerical rb technique can be extended in a straightforward , if tedious , fashion to investigate 2-qubit sequences .",
    "we have only considered the case where the magnetic field noise and charge noise are of similar magnitude , have the same @xmath1 , and are generated independently : it will be interesting to relax some of these constraints .",
    "in particular it could be interesting to examine the effect of correlated noises , and it may be possible to construct families of pulse sequences that sacrifice some performance on general independent noise in favor of performance on correlated noise .",
    "another open question relates to the failure of the gaussian approximation for colored noise  the noise is not only characterized by the power spectrum , but also by the microscopic structure of the environment .",
    "for example , rather than our weighted sum of rtss , modeling the case where the noise is due to a collection of two - level fluctuators with random switching rates , the same noise spectrum could arise from a single fluctuator with an undetermined switching rate .",
    "due to the failure of the gaussian approximation , these different environments may cause different behavior ( see , for example ref .  ) .",
    "our numerical technique can be extended to investigate the behavior of our gates under such different environments .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that our protocol@xcite for performing robust quantum control of semiconductor spin qubits , supcode , can be extended to incorporate the numerous complications inherent in a real quantum device without compromising any of its error - suppressing capabilities .",
    "we have shown that this is true for both the full range of single - qubit operations as well as for an entangling two - qubit gate , demonstrating that noise - resistant universal quantum control can be achieved in actual experiments . in the case of the two - qubit gate , we have also explained how the gate operation time can be substantially reduced compared to earlier work , constituting a crucial step toward experimental implementation .",
    "in addition , we have provided a randomized benchmarking for our proposed gate control operations .",
    "below , we summarize our main findings regarding each of these points .",
    "the most important message of this work is that the applicability of supcode is not in any way diminished when various experimental complications are taken into account .",
    "one such complication stems from the dependence of the exchange coupling on the detuning .",
    "this dependence varies from sample to sample and has a large impact on the effect of charge noise on the qubit , so it is therefore important that schemes to combat charge noise such as supcode are able to incorporate this dependence into their functionality . in our earlier work on supcode , as well as in other theoretical and experimental works ,",
    "a simple model in which the exchange coupling is assumed to increase exponentially with the detuning was used .",
    "while this assumption can greatly simplify the theoretical analysis , it also raises the question of whether the efficacy of supcode depends on this assumption . here",
    ", we have explicitly shown that this is not the case , and that supcode remains equally effective for other models of the exchange - coupling dependence on detuning .",
    "in fact , for a general model , we have seen that one simply needs to adjust the form of the coupled nonlinear equations and then follow the standard procedure to solve them to obtain error - suppressing pulse sequences .",
    "we demonstrated this fact explicitly for two alternative choices of the exchange coupling function and showed that numerical solutions can still be found .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that these results hold for both the single and two - qubit gates .",
    "a second complication that arises in real experiments is that pulses can not be made perfectly square ; instead they necessarily contain a finite rise time during which the exchange coupling switches between zero and non - zero values . replacing the perfect square with a trapezoidal model for the pulses",
    ", we showed that a finite rise time would merely translate to rather small shifts in the pulse parameters relative to the values obtained for square pulses .",
    "we further showed that it is generally the case that one can start with the pulse parameters found assuming perfectly square pulses , and then optimize around these values to obtain noise - resistant sequences of pulses with finite rise times .",
    "the fact that finite rise times do not lead to a substantial change in the parameters means that such a search remains local in parameter space and is relatively easy to perform .    a third experimental reality that our earlier works on supcode did not account for is the fact that the noise is not truly static , exhibiting some variation on longer time scales .",
    "to address the importance of this effect on the operation of supcode , we presented a complete randomized benchmarking analysis showing that this indeed puts some limitations on the performance of supcode .    to make supcode experimentally feasible , it is not only important to account for the issues that arise in real physical systems , but it is also crucial to shorten the total gate operation times as much as possible . in particular , we showed that the length of the corrected two - qubit gate presented in ref",
    ".   can be significantly reduced by about 35% .",
    "this large reduction is made possible by replacing the bb1 sequence with a generalized sk1 sequence , in conjunction with some additional optimizations to the sequence .",
    "it is , in principle , likely that the pulse sequence can be shortened further through extensive numerical searches for better optimization , but given that the pulse sequences proposed in this work are already short enough for laboratory implementations , we believe that the time is here for a serious experimental investigation of supcode to test its efficiency in producing error - resistant one- and two - qubit gates for spin qubit operations in semiconductor quantum dot systems .",
    "quantum dot spin qubits , particularly because of their scalability , are one of the primary candidates for the building blocks of a quantum computer .",
    "the noise - insensitive gates generated by supcode help fill the need for precise and robust quantum control in these qubits . in this paper",
    ", we show how one may apply supcode to produce noise - resistant single - qubit , two - qubit and multi - qubit operations .",
    "not only do supcode sequences respect all the fundamental experimental constraints associated with singlet - triplet qubits , but they also possess a remarkable robustness and flexibility when realistic , sample - dependent factors are taken into account .",
    "we therefore believe that a judicious use of supcode is capable of bringing gate errors below the quantum error correction threshold , thus ushering in the possibility of fault - tolerant quantum computation in singlet - triplet semiconductor spin qubits .",

    "<S> supcode enables dynamical error suppression even when the control field is constrained to be positive and uniaxial , making it particularly suited to counteracting the effects of noise in systems subject to these constraints such as singlet - triplet qubits . </S>",
    "<S> we describe and explain in detail how to generate supcode pulse sequences for arbitrary single - qubit gates and provide several explicit examples of sequences that implement commonly used gates , including the single - qubit clifford gates . </S>",
    "<S> we develop sequences for noise - resistant two - qubit gates for two exchanged - coupled singlet - triplet qubits by cascading robust single - qubit gates , leading to a 35% reduction in gate time compared to previous works . </S>",
    "<S> this cascade approach can be scaled up to produce gates for an arbitrary - length spin qubit array , and is thus relevant to scalable quantum computing architectures . </S>",
    "<S> to more accurately describe real spin qubit experiments , we show how to design sequences that incorporate additional features and practical constraints such as sample - specific charge noise models and finite pulse rise times . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a detailed analysis based on randomized benchmarking to show how supcode gates perform under realistic @xmath0 noise and find a strong dependence of gate fidelity on the exponent @xmath1 , with best performance for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> our supcode sequences can therefore be used to implement robust universal quantum computation while accommodating the fundamental constraints and experimental realities of singlet - triplet qubits . </S>"
