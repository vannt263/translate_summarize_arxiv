    "many of theories beyond the standard model exploit two important hypotheses : space - time supersymmetry and multidimensionality ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the complete realization of these hypotheses in field theoretical or string models meets considerable problems .",
    "the most important problem to be solved in susy models is to find a mechanism providing susy - breaking at the scale of about @xmath3 .",
    "similar problem of finding a mechanism of spontaneous compactification at the energy scale of a few @xmath4 exists in models with extra dimensions .",
    "also , it is well known that the supersymmetry in principle lowers under compactification of a part of space - time dimensions @xcite .",
    "thus , it is quite natural to suppose that the susy - breaking scale @xmath5 tev is close to the compactification scale @xmath6 .",
    "another argument backing this assumption arises from possible cancellations of non - logarithmic corrections to coupling constant renormalizations , this was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . with such compactification scale",
    "one can expect that an evidence of the existence of extra dimensions will be seen in future experiments at supercolliders .",
    "another serious problem in multidimensional field theoretical calculations is non - renormalizability of the theory .",
    "perhaps the true complete description of fundamental interactions is given by some ultraviolate finite theory .",
    "nowadays there is a common belief that such theory does exist and this is the superstring theory [ 1 ] .",
    "unfortunately , calculations in the framework of the superstring theory are very complicated and model dependent .",
    "to study low energy effects one has to work within an effective multidimensional non - renormalizable model . in such model physical amplitudes",
    "can be calculated by performing renormalizations order by order of perturbation expansion . for this one",
    "has to add to the lagrangian counterterms with higher derivatives , they are supposed to emerge from the complete ( superstring ) theory as a consequence of the existence of superheavy particles of plank mass @xcite .",
    "whereas in the framework of a complete finite quantum theory these counterterms of the low energy sector could be calculated explicitly , in the effective non - renormalizable model , we are discussing here , necessary counterterms are added by hand and coupling constants of the new vertices , given by these counterterms , are considered as phenomenological ones .",
    "fortunately , the contributions of these counterterms to the finite part of the amplitudes are of the order @xmath7 [ 1 ] , where @xmath8 is the energy of colliding particles , @xmath9 can be regarded as the characteristic scale of the complete theory(@xmath10 in the case of superstrings ) and @xmath11 .",
    "thus , when @xmath12 these contributions can be neglected .    in the present paper we estimate possible manifestations of effects due to the presence of extra dimensions in a scalar @xmath13-model on six - dimensional space - time @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is",
    "the four - dimensional minkowski space - time and @xmath16 is the two - dimensional torus .",
    "we believe that this simple model captures many features of more realistic multidimensional models , in particular qualitative behaviour of scattering amplitudes calculated here we expect to be rather generic .",
    "we would like to mention also that there are some phenomenologically consistent kaluza - klein type models just in six dimensions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "similar calculations were done for a toy scalar field model in ( 2 + 2)-dimensional space - time @xmath17 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a few more remarks are in order .",
    "the question of physical effects in multidimensional theories but from a different point of view was addressed in @xcite . there",
    "the authors used the results of the high energy experiments to get the upper bound on the size @xmath0 of the space of extra dimensions assuming that the first heavy kaluza - klein mode had not been yet observed directly .",
    "our approach in the present paper is different in two aspects .",
    "first , the authors of @xcite considered only one ( the first ) heavy kaluza - klein mode as an exited vector boson . in our calculations here we take into account the whole kaluza - klein tower of particles and , hence , all peculiarities of calculations in non - renormalizable theories .",
    "second , we assume that @xmath18 and look for possible experimental evidence of heavy kaluza - klein modes .    in the next section",
    "we describe our model and renormalization condition . in sect.3",
    "the results of 1-loop calculations for amplitudes and scattering cross section are presented .",
    "sect.4 is devoted to the analysis of these results .",
    "sect.5 contains some conclusions .",
    "we consider here a model of one real scalar field @xmath19 on the six - dimensional space - time @xmath20 with the radii of the torus being equal to @xmath21 .",
    "the action is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 ; the metric @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 are six - dimensional bare coupling constants , dots in the integrand denote possible higher derivative terms .",
    "the last term is necessary for the renormalization of the 4-point green function at one loop order .",
    "the field @xmath19 is periodic in coordinates @xmath27 : @xmath28 and can be expanded in fourier series : @xmath29 substituting the fourier expansion into the action ( 1 ) we get @xmath30 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the scalar product , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are four - dimensional bare coupling constants .",
    "the field @xmath34 with the light mass @xmath35 in our simple scalar model would be an analog of the usual vector fields and fermion fields in the standard model , whereas the kaluza - klein tower of fields @xmath36 with heavy masses @xmath37 would be an analog of a set of fields of a multidimensional extension of the standard model .",
    "the action ( [ 2 ] ) describes the four - dimensional theory with infinite number of massive fields , and it is important to notice that , as a consequence of the six - dimensional nature of the model , interactions between modes are determined by a few coupling constants only .    as a process imitating the present possibilities of collider experiments it is reasonable to consider @xmath38 scattering assuming that @xmath35 and the scattering energy satisfies @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath40 is expected to be proportional to @xmath41 ( see discussion in the introduction ) it is natural to assume that @xmath42 .",
    "so , for the process under consideration the interaction term with the coupling constant @xmath40 will be taken into account in the next - to - leading order only .",
    "then the scattering amplitude of the light @xmath43-particles in the leading approximation is defined by the usual tree contribution of the vertex @xmath44 .",
    "one can see that heavy modes do not contribute at this level .",
    "the reason is that there are no vertices with only one heavy field in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) as a consequence of rotational symmetry on the torus @xmath16 .",
    "this property is rather generic and holds for other types of scalar interactions and all compact spaces of extra dimensions .",
    "hence , the lowest order where we can hope to find some new effects due to the kaluza - klein tower of modes is the one loop order .    to perform 1-loop calculations for scattering of light particles besides the vertex @xmath45 with",
    "the light fields only the following relevant vertices must be taken into account @xmath46    we will show that due to these vertices the massive kaluza - klein fields give considerable contribution to the cross section of the scattering process under investigation .    regularized two light particle scattering amplitude to the one - loop order in our model has the following form ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath47 \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\        & + & h_{b } \\frac{p_{12}^{2}+p_{13}^{2}+p_{14}^{2}}{12 }                                                         \\ ,     \\label{3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 are the external momenta of the 1-loop diagram satisfying the conservation law @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 are regularized 1-loop contributions of the @xmath55th mode given by the usual four - dimensional momentum integral @xmath56 ( k^2-m_{n}^2+i\\varepsilon ) }                    \\label{4}\\ ] ] the last integral is regularized by momentum cut - off , other appropriate regularizations ( e.g. the dimensional regularization ) will also work here .",
    "thus , we have two regulators in the model : the momentum cut - off @xmath57 regularizing the four - dimensional integrals and the cut - off @xmath58 regularizing the sum over @xmath59 .",
    "let us discuss now the renormalization of our amplitude .",
    "the sum of the 1-loop integrals in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) corresponds to a 1-loop integral of the type ( [ 4 ] ) in the original six - dimensional theory ( [ 1 ] ) which is quadratically divergent .",
    "thus , if the calculations were carried out directly in six dimensions one would have to make two subtractions to obtain finite result .",
    "since compactification does not influence the ultraviolate properties of the theory also two subtractions are needed in general to make the amplitude ( [ 3 ] ) in four - dimensions to be finite .",
    "the additional divergence , which is due to the six - dimensional nature of the comlete model , reveals itself in the divergence of the sum in ( [ 3 ] ) after the logarithmical divergence of each term @xmath60 is removed .",
    "it is for this reason that the regulator @xmath58 have been introduced .",
    "similar to usual quadratic divergencies in four dimensional models this additional divergence gives rise to quadratic corrections to the renormalization of the coupling constant thus reducing considerably the range of validity of the perturbation theory and , because of this , is quite undesirable .",
    "fortunately , in the case under consideration the quadratic divergencies vanish in the sum of three channels in the amplitude ( [ 3 ] ) on the mass shell if the renormalization is carried out according to standard condition @xmath61 at the physical subtraction point satisfying @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the physical ( renormalized ) coupling constant .    indeed , expressing @xmath64 in terms of the physical coupling constant the amplitude ( [ 3 ] ) can be written as @xmath65 + h_{b } \\frac { p_{12}^{2 } + p_{13}^{2 } + p_{14}^{2 } -       \\mu_{s}^{2 } - \\mu_{t}^{2 } - \\mu_{u}^{2}}{12 } \\ .",
    "\\label{ampl1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of course , to renormalize the coupling constant @xmath40 additional condition must be imposed .",
    "however , this is not necessary for our purpose .",
    "the differences of the type @xmath66 are finite and do not depend on the regulator @xmath57 .",
    "we will represent them as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the finite part of the 1-loop integral @xcite @xmath69 which is equal to @xmath70 it is easy to see that for small @xmath71 the expressions ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) have the following taylor expansion @xmath72    let us show now that the scattering amplitude ( [ ampl1 ] ) is actually finite and does not depend on the cut - off @xmath58 on the mass shell .",
    "taking formulas ( [ diff ] ) and ( [ jexp ] ) into account one gets @xmath73 \\right\\ }                                                          \\label{ampl2 } \\\\     & + & h_{b } \\frac { p_{12}^{2 } + p_{13}^{2 } + p_{14}^{2 } -           \\mu_{s}^{2 } - \\mu_{t}^{2 } - \\mu_{u}^{2}}{12 } \\ .",

    "( [ s.p . ] ) this amounts to vanishing of the first term in the square brackets and the term proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "the rest of the one - loop contribution in the expression ( [ ampl2 ] ) is equal to the finite sum so that the cut - off @xmath58 can be sent to infinity .",
    "we also see that the amplitude renormalized by the condition ( [ renorm ] ) is independent of the coupling constant @xmath40 on the mass shell .",

    "( [ s.p . ] ) .",
    "in this section we will study the contribution of heavy kaluza - klein particles to the total cross section of the scattering of two light particles ( zero modes ) .",
    "the most interesting range of energies is above the threshold of the light particle and below the threshold of the first heavy mode : @xmath83 . indeed ,",
    "due to decoupling of heavy modes at low energies ( see @xcite ) the contribution of the kaluza - klein tower below @xmath84 is likely to be negligible . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath85 it is very unlikely that the energies of colliders will exceed the threshold of the first heavy particle in the near future .",
    "for the purpose of our analysis we found convenient to introduce the following quantity @xmath86 here @xmath87 is the total cross section of the @xmath88 scattering calculated using the amplitude of the type ( [ ampl3 ] ) but with summation over @xmath59 satisfying @xmath89 only .",
    "physically this means that only a finite number of heavy particles of the kaluza - klein tower with @xmath90 contribute to the 1-loop correction to the total cross section @xmath91 .",
    "the cross section calculated in the complete six - dimensional theory is equal to @xmath92 .",
    "notice that to compute the leading order of @xmath93 in @xmath63 only tree approximation for @xmath94 is used in the denominator of ( [ deltadef ] ) .",
    "we calculate the total cross sections using formulas ( [ 9 ] ) , ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ ampl3 ] ) and get the following expression for @xmath95 @xmath96\\ ,                                                        \\label{deltafin}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 and we put @xmath98 . for numerical evaluations",
    "we take @xmath99 since @xmath100 the function ( [ deltadef ] ) practically depends on the variable @xmath101 only .",
    "the plot of @xmath102 as a function of @xmath71 is presented in fig . 1 .",
    "the behaviour of this function shows that the contribution of the kaluza - klein tower of particles increases rapidly when the energy of colliding particles grows .",
    "we see that accummulation of these contributions is considerable and gives a quite noticeable effect even for energies much below the threshold of the first heavy mode .",
    "thus , @xmath103 for @xmath104 and @xmath105 for @xmath106 . even for @xmath107",
    "the effect is not that small : @xmath108 .",
    "it is clear , of course , that due to the convergence of the sum in ( [ deltafin ] ) the heavier the particle of the kaluza - klein tower the less it contributes to this sum .",
    "hence the curve @xmath109 actually represents the contributions of a few first modes .",
    "( to draw the plot in fig .",
    "1 we approximated it by @xmath110 .",
    "we found that this approximation is sufficiently good , for example , @xmath111 for all @xmath77 in the range under investigation . )",
    "it is useful to evaluate relative contributions of a few first heavy modes . in a more realistic model comparison of these kind of estimates with experimental data",
    "would allow us to conclude how many heavy particles one actually `` detects '' in the experiment ( see discussion in the next section ) .",
    "to analyse this we calculated the function @xmath112 , representing the contribution of the first heavy mode , for the same range of energies ( fig .",
    "1 ) . from the curves in fig . 1",
    "one can clearly distinguish the `` infinite '' number of modes and just one first mode for the energies below its threshold .",
    "thus , the difference between them is about @xmath113 for @xmath114 and about @xmath115 for @xmath116 .    to have more illustrative characteristics let us introduce the quantities @xmath117 which show the relative contribution of the first @xmath118 heavy kaluza - klein modes , and the quantities @xmath119 which show the relative contribution of the @xmath118th mode .",
    "the plots for some @xmath120 and @xmath121 for the same range of energies as before are presented in fig.2 and fig.3 . combining the results presented in fig .",
    "3 we conclude that with accuracy about @xmath122 the function @xmath123 in the energy region @xmath124 shows the presence of at least @xmath125 first heavy modes in the theory .",
    "we have shown that effective field theories , obtained from models in @xmath126 dimensions , provide self - consistent way to calculate possible effects related to their multidimensional nature .",
    "though our model is not physical we believe that the results ( for example , rapid growth of @xmath123 above the threshold of the light particle ) capture some general features in the more realistic theories . in the latter case",
    "analogous results could be _ in principle _ used for comparison with experiments as follows .",
    "we assume that the low - energy sector of the theory , which is the sector consisting the field @xmath127 only , is already well determined .",
    "thus , the value of the coupling constant @xmath63 is known ( notice , that due to the multidimensional nature of the complete theory the coupling constant of the self - interaction of @xmath127 and coupling constants of the interactions of the zero mode with non - zero ones are the same , see ( [ 2 ] ) , ( [ 3 ] ) , ( [ interact ] ) ) , and the total cross section @xmath128 of the @xmath129 scattering within the low energy sector can be calculated with sufficient accuracy .",
    "experimentally we measure the total cross section @xmath130 and compute the quantity @xmath131 ( cf .",
    "( [ deltadef ] ) ) .",
    "if above the threshold of the light particle @xmath132 , there are no any evidence of heavy kaluza - klein modes at given energies . if @xmath133 , there is an evidence of the existence of heavier particles .",
    "next step would be to see which curve @xmath134 fits the experimental data best .",
    "if it is the curve with @xmath135 or sufficiently large @xmath118 , then this might be considered as an indirect evidence of the multidimensional nature of the interactions , at least in the framework of the given model and given type of compactification .",
    "our calculations suggest that the effect is rather noticeable even for energies below the threshold of the first heavy particle ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . thus , @xmath108 for @xmath107 that , with our supposition @xmath136 corresponds to the energy of colliding particles @xmath137 .",
    "our numerical estimations show also that a few ( @xmath138 ) first kaluza - klein modes can be `` seen '' in the range @xmath139 with @xmath122 accuracy .",
    "we would like to mention that we also computed the differential cross section of the @xmath140 scattering .",
    "however it does not add essentially new information about the relative contributions of the heavy kaluza - klein particles .",
    "an interesting question is whether different types of compactification can be distinguished at these energies .",
    "the main difference comes from the structure of the spectrum of the states in the theory , namely from the multiplicities of states with the same mass and the rate of the growth of the mass with @xmath141 ( see ( [ mass ] ) ) .",
    "this issue is under investigation now .",
    "also it would be interesting to understand whether one can distinguish between kaluza - klein type models and certain models with infinite tower of composite particles .",
    "two more remarks are in order . here",
    "we considered effects when the energies of the scattering particles are less then the threshold of the first kaluza - klein particle . in this case momentum behaviour of the effective ( running ) coupling constant",
    "is mainly defined by the contribution of the lightest mode only @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "note that renormalization group equation for the coupling constant @xmath63 , which is physically important at ( relatively low ) energies @xmath142 , is independent of the coupling constant @xmath143 of the vertices with derivatives ( the latter is important for renormalization only ) @xcite .",
    "another remark is that there are two cases when heavy modes may give more considerable contributions .",
    "the first case includes multidimensional models with non - scalar particles . in such models for certain spaces of extra dimensions",
    "some of the heavy kaluza - klein modes may give non - zero contributions in the tree approximation of perturbation theory .",
    "the second possibility is to consider specific processes for which the tree approximation is absent and the leading contribution is given by the 1-loop diagrams even in the zero mode sector of the theory .",
    "such processes are obviously more sensitive to the heavy kaluza - klein modes .",
    "these possibilities are also under investigation .",
