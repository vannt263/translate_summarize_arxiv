    "[ tab : param ]    the first real amsp 1808   was discovered in 1998 by @xcite .",

    "the fastest amsp ,  with the period of just 1.67 ms is the fifth fastest among all known pulsars ( including radio- and nuclear - powered msps ) .",
    "the last amsp  was discovered in june 2005 .",
    "amsps show pulse frequency variations .",
    "these observations are very important for understanding of the evolution of the neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries towards radio msps .",
    "they would also shed some light on a complicated problem of the interaction of the magnetosphere with the accretion flow .",
    "one expects a spin - up rate @xmath7 where ( notation @xmath8 in cgs units is used ) @xmath9 is the neutron star moment of inertia , @xmath10 is the luminosity , @xmath11 is the accretion efficiency , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the magnetospheric and corotation radii .",
    "some reported @xmath14 are , however , _ negative _ implying pulsar slowing down during the outburst @xcite .",
    "@xcite finds wild swings in the apparent spin frequency of both signs resulting in the total fractional phase shift less than 0.15 .",
    "these could be , however , artifacts of the pulse profile variations ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : lags ] ) .",
    "the reported positive @xmath15 hz / s for  @xcite is larger than expected by a factor of 5 ( since @xmath16 ) .",
    "a positional error of @xmath17 could result in such a large derivative , while the radio position is known with a @xmath18 accuracy @xcite .",
    "the motion of the radio source itself does not produce an error larger than @xmath19 ( for the distance of 5 kpc ) a week after the outburst , confirming the reality of the pulsar spin - up and possibly implying a small moment of inertia @xmath9 .",
    "accretion - powered pulsars reside in very compact binary systems with orbital periods ranging from 40 min to 4.3 h. surprisingly three out of 7 pulsars have @xmath20 min orbits . adding to this set also 4u1626 - 67 , 4u1916 - 05 and x1832 - 330",
    "( in globular cluster ngc 6652 ) with orbital periods of 42 , 50 , and 44 min , respectively , it becomes clear that this",
    "interesting fact deserves some explanation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a possible scenario ) .",
    "the pulsar mass function @xmath21 is very low for all the objects implying extremely low companion masses consistent with degenerate white ( helium or carbon - oxygen ) or brown dwarfs @xcite except  which contains probably a hydrogen - rich star @xcite .",
    "all  are transients with the outbursts repeating every few years and lasting a few weeks .",
    "they have a rather low time - average accretion rate of @xmath22 , which could be the main reason for magnetic field still to be strong enough for pulsations to be observed @xcite .",
    "the broad - band coverage of the _ rxte _ together with _ xmm",
    "_ gave a possibility to study the spectra of amsp in great details .",
    "the spectra can be modelled by three components : two soft , thermally looking ones below a few kev and a power - law like tail ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spectrum_1751 ] ) .    the two soft components which can be modelled as thermal emission from a colder ( @xmath23 kev ) accretion disc and a hotter ( @xmath24 kev ) spot on the neutron star surface .",
    "the softer components in  and are studied with the _ xmm _ by @xcite .",
    "the obtained inner disk radius @xmath25 is consistent with the flow disrupted by the neutron star magnetosphere within a couple of stellar radii .",
    "the hotter black body normalization corresponding to the area of @xmath26 and its pulsation are consistent with it being produces in a spot at the neutron star surface .",
    "a power - law tail ( having spectral photon index @xmath27 ) shows a cutoff around 100 kev and can be fitted with thermal comptonization .",
    "the electron temperature of the comptonizing medium is around @xmath282060 kev and thomson optical depth of @xmath290.72.5 ( for a plane - parallel slab geometry ) @xcite .",
    "weakness of the compton reflection from the disk indicates that the solid angle covered by the disk as viewed from the main emission source ( accretion shock ) is small , being consistent with @xmath30 km @xcite .",
    "the broad - band x - ray spectra of  are very similar to each other .",
    "they also show very little variability during the outbursts ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when fitting spectra with thermal comptonization models , one also finds that the product of the electron temperature and optical depth is almost invariant ( e.g. @xmath31=[60\\ \\kev , 0.88]$ ] in 1808 ; @xmath32 $ ] in , @xmath33 $ ] in , @xmath34 $ ] in ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the constancy of the spectral slope can be used as an argument that the emission region geometry does not vary much with the accretion rate .",
    "if the energy dissipation takes place in a hot shock , while the cooling of the electrons is determined by the reprocessing of the hard x - ray radiation at the neutron star surface ( two - phase model , e.g. @xcite ) , the spectral slope is determined by the energy balance in the hot phase and , therefore , by the geometry .",
    "the pulse profiles from  are rather close to sinusoidal with peak - to - peak oscillation amplitude @xmath35 between 4 ( in ) and 12 per cent ( in ) . at energies above 50 kev the  data on",
    "show the increase of the pulse amplitude up to @xmath36 25 per cent @xcite .",
    "deviations from the sine wave are stronger at higher energies ( see fig .",

    "the harmonic content also is stronger when @xmath37 is larger ( e.g. the harmonic - to - fundamental ratio is @xmath38 in  @xcite , while it is @xmath39 in  @xcite .",
    "pulse profiles at higher energies reach their peaks at an earlier phase relative to the soft photons resulting in the soft time lags . in 1808",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite , and @xcite the lags increase ( in absolute value ) with energy up to about 710 kev after they saturate ( see fig .",

    "one can point out that the contribution of the black body decreases exponentially with energy and the lags increase significantly at the same time . above @xmath40 kev ,",
    "the blackbody s contribution is negligible and the lags saturate .",
    "when fitting phase - resolved spectra with a two - component model ( blackbody + comptonization ) , one clearly sees that the normalizations of the components do not vary in phase , with black body lagging the comptonized emission ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fars_bbtf ] and @xcite ) . in 1808",
    "the profile corresponding to the comptonized emission is clearly non - sinusoidal .",
    "difference in profiles of the two components can be explained by their different emission pattern @xcite .",
    "its variation may cause pulse shape change resulting in the swings of @xmath41 discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : param ] .",
    "one believes that the bulk of the x - ray emission observed from   originates from polar caps where the gas stream channels by the neutron star magnetic field impacts the stellar surface forming a shock .",
    "this is supported by a weak energy dependence of the variability amplitude and a fairly constant spectral shape as a function of pulse phase ( any additional source of radiation would have to have a spectrum identical to that of the shock ) , as well as the observed broadening of the pulse peak in the power - spectrum of 1808 due to modulation of the aperiodic variability by the spin period @xcite .     and radius @xmath42 km , rotational frequency @xmath43 hz , the inclination @xmath44 , and the polar angle of the spot center @xmath45 . ,",
    "width=9 ]      pulse profile shape and variability amplitude carry the information about the compactness of the neutron star , spot size and its position at the star , and the emission pattern .",
    "gravitational light bending tends to decrease the pulse amplitude @xcite .",
    "an earlier attempt to incorporate the effect of rapid rotation using kerr metric @xcite did not include the dominant doppler boost caused by the star s surface motion in the locally non - rotating frame .",
    "this was criticized by @xcite .",
    "they also noticed that doppler boost and light travel time delays are important for shaping the profiles , while the frame dragging affects them at a @xmath46 level .",
    "the monte - carlo simulations used by @xcite for the light curve calculation are , however , extremely time - consuming and are hardly suitable for data fitting",
    ".    as frame dragging is not so important , one can consider schwarzschild metric instead .",
    "one can account for doppler effect making lorentz transformation from the frame rotating with the star to a non - rotating frame and then follow light trajectory in the schwarzschild space - time to infinity (  schwarzschild + doppler \" or sd approach ) .",
    "an attempt to formulate the problem was done by @xcite who considered the spot and the observer in the equatorial plane only .",
    "oscillation waveforms and amplitudes for arbitrary spot and observer position were computed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these paper provided no details on how to account for effect of aberration on intensity and projected spot area .",
    "a formalism for computing the pulse profiles accounting for doppler boosting , relativistic aberration and gravitational bending appeared for the first time in @xcite .",
    "effects of the anisotropy of comptonized radiation from a shock on the light curves and polarization were studied by @xcite .",
    "analytical formulae for oscillation amplitudes are presented by @xcite .",
    "light curves from realistic spots produced by accretion onto inclined magnetic dipole are computed by @xcite using formalism of @xcite .",
    "accuracy of the sd approach is discussed by @xcite .",
    "let us now briefly describe the main effects shaping the pulse profiles of . without general or special relativistic effects ,",
    "a small black body spot would produce sinusoidal variations ( with possible eclipses ) due to a change of the projected area .",
    "light bending reduces the variability amplitude ( compare dotted and dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : relat ] ) , while the pulse remains almost sinusoidal @xcite .",
    "relativistic aberration and doppler boosting modify the observed flux for rapidly spinning star .",
    "the projected area is changed by the doppler factor @xmath47 due to aberration , and the frequency - integrated specific intensity is multiplied by @xmath48 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since @xmath47 reaches the maximum a quarter of the period earlier than the projected area ( fig .",
    "[ fig : relat]b ) , the pulse becomes skewed to the left ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : relat ] and compare it to fig .",
    "[ fig : data_sax1808 ] ) .",
    "light travel time delays slightly modify the profile further ( note , that time delays are already accounted for in the flux calculations by one of the doppler factors ) .      due to the combined action of the doppler effect and time delays , the pulse profile deviates from a simple sine wave .",
    "( we consider below the situation where the spot is always visible . )",
    "the relative amplitudes ( in the bolometric signal ) of the harmonic @xmath49 to that of the fundamental @xmath50 grows approximately linearly with the rotational frequency @xcite : @xmath51where @xmath52 is the inclination and @xmath53 is the polar angle of the spot center .",
    "even a slight deviation from the isotropic emission ( e.g. in the form @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the angle from the spot normal and @xmath56 is the anisotropy parameter ) leads to a high harmonic content @xcite : @xmath57},\\]]where @xmath58 .",
    "the harmonic content @xmath59 as well as the total rms are proportional to @xmath60 @xcite . therefore , one expects harmonics to be relatively stronger when rms is larger which is exactly what is observed .",
    "increasing the spot size leads to a reduction of the amplitude of the harmonic first and of the total rms later @xcite .    if the spectrum has a sharp cutoff , the rms amplitude of the pulse at energies above the cutoff increases dramatically .",
    "the flux varies as @xmath61 @xcite , where @xmath62 is the energy - dependent photon spectral index , resulting in the rms energy dependence @xmath63 .",
    "for the spectrum in the form @xmath64^{\\beta})$ ] , which is typical for comptonization , the photon index @xmath65 . at low energies , @xmath66 , and",
    "rms is a very weak function of energy .",
    "close to the cutoff , the spectral index rapidly increases resulting in a significant grow of the rms , as observed in the  data for  @xcite . in case of coherent oscillations observed during x - ray bursts , a linear increase of the rms with energy",
    "is expected , since the spectrum is close to a blackbody which has an exponential cutoff ( see also @xcite ) .          the amplitude of variability and the pulse shape ( harmonic content ) can be used to put constraints on the compactness of the neutron star , position , size and the emission pattern of a radiating spot . in case of the coherent oscillations observed during the x - ray bursts the constraints on the compactness are not very tight @xcite .",
    "a very weak harmonic content led to the conclusion that the bright region ( or the line of sight ) must be near the rotational pole or must cover half of the star @xcite .",
    "fitting the pulse profile shape ( but not the amplitude ) of the oscillations observed during the x - ray burst of  was performed by @xcite , who obtained the preferred spot polar angle @xmath67 .",
    "this is highly improbable since an identical ( in shape and phase ) pulse observed in the persistent emission @xcite would require the magnetic poles to lie at the equator and the antipodal spot should then be visible too .    for  the statistics in the pulse profiles",
    "is much better since the pulse is folded over a longer observational period ( days or weeks rather than seconds as in the case of x - ray bursts ) .",
    "this allowed to obtain tight constraints on the neutron star compactness in 1808  as well as the emission pattern ( consistent with comptonization from the plane - parallel shock ) , inclination , and the spot polar angle ( see @xcite , and fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] ) .",
    "we have reviewed here x - ray observations of the amsps concentrating on the broad - band spectra and the energy - dependent pulse profiles .",
    "recent advances in the theoretical modelling of the spectral and timing characteristics are also described . at the observational side",
    ", we are missing the details of the pulse profile and spectral evolution during the outbursts .",
    "one would expect that the changing accretion rate would force a change in the accretion pattern on to a neutron star surface , causing corresponding profile variations .",
    "detailed studies of the reflection amplitude and frequencies of quasi - periodic oscillations should reveal changes in the inner disk radius during outbursts .",
    "the pulse profile should also react correspondingly as the visibility of the antipodal spot depends on the disk radius .",
    "combined with the spin - up rate observations , these would shed some light on a complicated problem of the magnetosphere interaction with the accretion flow . on the theoretical side , we need a detailed model describing the dynamics of the accretion flow onto the neutron star surface including radiation feedback .",
    "it is not clear yet what fraction of the material follows the magnetic field lines towards the poles .",
