    "one of the simplest cases to study the effects of impurities in magnetic systems occurs in some doped uniaxial antiferromagnets such as @xmath0  @xcite , where the @xmath1 impurities do not induce competing interactions and monte carlo simulations with the three - dimensional random - site ising model reproduce accurately the behavior close to the curie temperature  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the successful application of renormalization group techniques  @xcite to the calculation of critical exponents for the pure ising model makes perturbative expansions a very appealing alternative to the monte carlo calculations mentioned above .",
    "the appropriate field theory for this problem is the usual @xmath2 theory in three dimensions modified with a random mass term , and the analytic difficulties raised by the quenched impurities are usually bypassed with the replica trick : the system is temporarily replaced by @xmath3 non - interacting copies for which the disorder is now annealed , yielding an @xmath4 theory with coupling constant proportional to minus the variance of the quenched disorder @xmath5 , with an additional cubic anisotropy term with coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "this theory can be studied perturbatively and the results corresponding to the original system recovered ( in principle ) in the limit @xmath7 .    indeed , there are rather accurate analytic calculations of the critical exponents of the random - site ising model  @xcite , but the situation is less satisfactory than for pure systems  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the asymptotic parameter in disordered systems is @xmath8 instead of @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the dimensionality of the space ) , and the @xmath12-function computed at three loops shows no stable fixed point  @xcite . in an attempt to understand disordered systems in a simpler setting , bray  @xcite and mckane  @xcite studied the asymptotic expansion for the free energy in the zero - dimensional case , with discouraging results : the toy - model was found non borel - summable , in sharp contrast with the ( ordered ) zero - dimensional @xmath2 theory , where borel - summability has been rigorously proved  @xcite .",
    "( indeed , borel summability in three dimensions has been also proved  @xcite . )",
    "we consider in this paper the same zero - dimensional problem of references  @xcite , and show that a slightly more elaborated procedure can recover the free energy from the perturbative expansion : the borel - summation has to be carried out first in the strength of the original coupling of the ising model @xmath6 and subsequently in the variance of the quenched disorder @xmath5 .",
    "the layout of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first review the main results of bray  and mckane in section  [ sec : pre ] ; the derivation of the borel - summable double asymptotic expansion for the free energy is carried out in the third section ; in section  [ sec : num ] we give the details of our numerical procedure and some illustrative examples , and the paper ends with a brief summary .",
    "the free energy of the zero - dimensional ising model with quenched dilution can be studied with a @xmath2 theory with a random mass term @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the partition function .",
    "bray  @xcite fix @xmath15 and write the asymptotic expansion for the free energy as @xmath16 where the @xmath17 are polynomials in @xmath18 with rational coefficients and degree @xmath19 .",
    "then they use the replica trick an a saddle point argument to infer that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath17 as @xmath20 is given by two terms : @xmath21 the term @xmath22 is dominant for @xmath23 and borel - summable , while @xmath24 with coefficients @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 that they ultimately adjust by comparison between this asymptotic formula and the numerical values of the @xmath17 for @xmath19 up to 200 and several values of @xmath18 greater than @xmath29 .",
    "the increasing - period cosine oscillations suggest them that there is an essential singularity of the borel - transform in the positive real @xmath6 axis , and therefore the series is not borel - summable for any finite disorder ( although the term @xmath30 is subdominant in the region @xmath23 ) . despite the non - summability of the series  ( [ eq : fak ] ) , i.e.  acknowledging that there would be some error even if they could compute with all the terms , bray  set @xmath31 and try to extract an accurate answer from  ( [ eq : fak ] ) using a conformal transformation suitable for oscillatory series , but they find that as soon as @xmath32 the method fails .",
    "mckane  @xcite avoids the replica trick in favor of a more direct analysis that clearly identifies the two sources of non - analytic behavior of the free energy leading to the two contributions is equation  ( [ eq : akasy ] ) : the branch cut along the negative @xmath6 axis and the zeros of the partition function  ( [ eq : z ] ) .",
    "moreover , he obtains the exact values of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 in terms of the zeros of the partition function and guesses the form of the nonperturbative contributions to the free energy that yield the asymptotic behavior  ( [ eq : akasy ] ) .",
    "the possibility of alternative summation methods , however , remained unaddressed in these works .",
    "for analyticity considerations , we remark that in terms of the new variable @xmath33 the partition function  ( [ eq : z ] ) can be written as @xmath34 which in turn  @xcite can be expressed in terms of a parabolic cylinder function or a modified bessel function : @xmath35 there is , however , another expression particularly suitable for later summability considerations : via a mellin - barnes integral  @xcite , the partition function can be written as a laplace transform in @xmath36 , @xmath37^{3/4 } }               \\qquad ( \\re ( z^2 ) > 0 )   \\label{eq : z2lt}\\\\             & = & \\frac{z}{(4u)^{1/4}\\gamma(\\case14 ) }               \\int_{0}^{\\infty }           \\frac{\\rmd t\\,\\e^{- t}}{[t(t+z^2)]^{3/4 } }               \\qquad ( \\re z > 0 ) .",

    "note that as @xmath39 varies along the real axis in the increasing sense , @xmath40 traces the positive axis in the decreasing sense , but as we shift ( say ) upwards the integration path and @xmath39 picks up a constant ( positive ) imaginary part [ i.e. @xmath49 , equation  ( [ eq : zd ] ) shows that @xmath40 traces a spiral ending at the origin for @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath51 the spiral passes again through the origin ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "therefore , if we shift vertically the integration path to @xmath52 ( with @xmath53 ) , we pick up a finite number of contributions from the zeros of @xmath40 whose evaluation in terms of the complementary error function is given by the following self - explanatory chain of equations : @xmath54\\nonumber\\\\   { } +           \\sum_{0<\\im z_{k}<\\im\\mu }               \\frac{1}{(\\lambda\\pi)^{1/2 } }           \\int_{-\\infty , z_{k}^{(+ ) } }           \\rmd z\\ , \\e^{- ( z - \\mu)^2/\\lambda }           \\log[f(z)]\\\\    \\lo= \\case12 \\log(2\\mu ) +        \\frac{1}{(\\lambda\\pi)^{1/2 } }           \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty }           \\rmd t\\ , \\e^{- t^2/\\lambda }           \\log[f(t+\\mu)]\\nonumber\\\\   { } +           \\sum_{0<\\im z_{k}<\\im\\mu }               \\frac{2\\pi\\rmi}{(\\lambda\\pi)^{1/2 } }           \\int_0^\\infty           \\rmd t\\ , \\e^{- ( z_k - t - \\mu)^2/\\lambda}\\\\    \\lo= \\case12 \\log(2\\mu ) +        \\frac{1}{(\\lambda\\pi)^{1/2 } }           \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty }           \\rmd t\\ , \\e^{- t^2/\\lambda }           \\log[f(t+\\mu)]\\nonumber\\\\   { } +           \\rmi\\pi\\sum_{0<\\im z_{k}<\\im\\mu }        { \\rm erfc}\\left(\\frac{\\mu - z_{k}}{\\lambda^{1/2}}\\right ) .",

    "of the two standard methods to achieve the analytic continuation implicit in the borel - summation ( conformal mapping or pad approximants ) we have chosen the second because it does not require a precise knowledge of the singularities of the function , although some pad approximants may introduce spurious singularities close to the integration path .",

    "furthermore , to avoid problems with the numerical integration we expand the pad approximant as a polynomial plus partial fractions , i.e. assuming that all the poles are simple @xmath104}(t ) = \\sum_{k=0}^{p - q } p_{k } t^{k } +                     \\frac{r(t)}{s(t ) }               = \\sum_{k=0}^{p - q } p_{k } t^{k } +             \\sum_{k=1}^{q }                 \\frac{r(t_{k})}{s'(t_{k})(t - t_{k})}\\ ] ] and the integration in equation  ( [ eq : nbt ] ) can be carried out in terms of complete and incomplete gamma functions evaluated at the @xmath105 poles @xmath106 of @xmath107}(t)$ ] : @xmath108 we have performed our calculations with the same 200 terms of the expansion  ( [ eq : logfmu ] ) used in reference  @xcite , using the arbitrary precision numerical capabilities of _ mathematica_. figure  2 shows some typical results of this first stage of our double - summation method . for four values of @xmath6 and the lowest eleven coefficients @xmath109 we plot a measure @xmath110 of the number of correct digits to the right of the decimal point , @xmath111 as a function of the order @xmath112 of the diagonal pad approximants @xmath113}(t)$ ] in equation  ( [ eq : nbt ] ) . as a general trend ,",
    "the precision of the summed coefficients increases with the order of the approximant , although with smaller slope for higher values of @xmath6 ( note that we have used the same scales in the four plots ) .",
    "the irregularities in figure  2 are often due to ill - conditioned linear systems of equations in the calculation of the pad approximants , and are usually corrected using higher precision or higher order approximants .",
    "we have also checked that neighboring off - diagonal pad approximants give similar results .    the second stage , the summation in @xmath5 , is equivalent to the @xmath114 summation of the first stage .",
    "now the borel - transformed coefficients @xmath115 are precisely the coefficients of the convergent taylor expansion of @xmath116 , and to illustrate how well the pad approximants continue the taylor series beyond the radius of convergence , we plot in figure  3 the exact integrand @xmath117 corresponding to @xmath31 in equation  ( [ eq : bmt ] ) , and its approximations @xmath118}(t)$ ] for @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the radius of convergence of the taylor series is marked in the plot by the vertical line at @xmath122 .    in figure  4 ( again with @xmath31 and for several values of @xmath18 ) we plot the number of correct digits to the right of the decimal point in the borel - summed free energy as a function of the order of the diagonal pad approximant .",
    "we have performed the calculations with all the @xmath123 of the same precision , so that the numerical error is due only to this second - stage summation .",
    "the first feature worth mentioning is the steady increase in the precision of the summed free energy ( with a few exceptions that are related again to the pad approximants ) , although the convergence is slower for larger values of @xmath18 .",
    "note that the plateau in the summation of bray  for @xmath124 ends approximately at fifty terms of the series , while at @xmath125 ( i.e. with 81 terms of the series ) we have steady numerical convergence ; @xmath126 corresponds to the switch between asymptotic behaviors in equation  ( [ eq : akasy ] ) , while in our reordering it is not a distinguished point ; finally , for @xmath127 bray  are already unable to get a good result , while our summation still gives four correct digits for @xmath128 .",
    "we have analyzed the borel - summability of the perturbative expansion for the free energy in one of the simplest disordered systems , the zero dimensional quenched diluted ising model .",
    "this expansion is a double asymptotic series in the original coupling @xmath6 of the ising model and in the variance @xmath5 of the quenched disorder , and we have shown that the expansion is in fact borel - summable by a sequential method : first we sum in the coupling @xmath6 and subsequently in the variance @xmath5 .",
    "this summability results are valid at least for @xmath89 and @xmath129 , with the understanding that if we want to recover the free energy and not the integral  ( [ eq : fzm ] ) , additional @xmath130 terms are needed in the domains specified in section  [ sec : asy ] .    a straightforward numerical implementation of our double summation method has permitted us to obtain ( with the same number of terms of the original series ) accurate free energies for values of the parameters well beyond the region where bray  were already unable to get an estimate .",
    "we expect that the insight provided by these zero dimensional results will be helpful in the understanding of the more complicated higher - dimensional case , despite the significant qualitative differences motivated by griffiths singularities  @xcite in the generalized sense of dotsenko  @xcite .",
    "in fact we feel that a clear understanding of the griffiths phase in the field - theoretical setting will be needed before the problem will be finally solved .",
    "finally , we would like to mention as open problems the study of the negative @xmath18 region , and a more thorough understanding of the solution of this problem using replicas .",
