    "in a recent high accuracy experimental study of electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole moments of a sequence of odd - mass cd isotopes @xcite it was noted that the electric quadrupole moments of the @xmath0 states in the cd isotopes vary linearly with neutron number and are very simply and very well described in terms of a @xmath1 orbital sequentially occupied in the seniority scheme with a large neutron effective charge @xmath2 . if this is so , the same simple physics should be manifest in the other presumed single quasi - particle states in cd and , a - fortiori , in the the sn isotopes which have a closed proton shell .",
    "the idea that the single neutron occupation probabilities can be so simply extracted from electromagnetic properties is sufficiently attractive to warrant a more detailed second look .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that this can be done using a minimalist theoretical framework .",
    "ultimately of course , large scale theoretical calculations , shell model or beyond - mean - field model , are required to describe the structure of these nuclei , including their electromagnetic properties .",
    "the aim of this paper is much more modest , but the picture is nevertheless useful for its simplicty .",
    "as theoretical framework , i use the spherical bcs model with a weak - coupling approximation to include quadrupole collectivity . in this model , @xcite the states in the odd - even isotopes with dominantly single quasi - particle parentage can be written as :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5    with the usual relation between the quasi - particle operators @xmath6 and the particle operators @xmath7    @xmath8    the bcs ground state is @xmath9 , and @xmath10 represents the first ( collective ) @xmath11 state which can usually be interpreted as a coherent superposition of two quasi - particle states .",
    "the coefficient @xmath12 is given in first - order perturbation theory by    @xmath13    i take the interaction potential @xmath14 to be a quadrupole - quadrupole force @xcite    @xmath15    where p , n refer to protons and neutrons respectively and the one - body quadrupole operator is    @xmath16    for a neutron quasi - particle , the expression for @xmath12 then becomes    @xmath17",
    "to first order in @xmath12 , the electric quadrupole moment of the weak coupling state in equation  [ qp_state ] is @xmath18 \\nonumber                                            \\\\              & = & \\sqrt{\\frac{16\\pi}{5 } } ( 2,0,j , j \\mid j , j)(u^2_j - v^2_j)\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2j+1 } } \\langle \\psi_j \\mid\\mid r^2 y_2 \\mid\\mid \\psi_j \\rangle     \\nonumber   \\\\                   & & \\left [ e_n + \\frac{2}{5 } \\frac{1}{e_2-e_0 } \\langle 2^{+ } \\mid\\mid e_n q(n ) + e_p q(p ) \\mid\\mid 0 \\rangle \\langle 2^{+ } \\mid\\mid \\chi_{nn } q(n ) +                   \\chi_{pn } q(p ) \\mid\\mid   0 \\rangle \\right ]         \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the neutron and proton effective charges . in shell model calculations ,",
    "their values are roughly @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite@xcite , attributed mainly to the giant quadrupole resonance that is not explicitly included in the usual shell model .",
    "there are different ways of estimating the strength of the effective quadrupole - quadrupole force , however @xmath23 is always substantially smaller than @xmath24 .",
    "since a ratio @xmath25 is obtained from hartree - fock calculations with a skyrme interaction @xcite,@xcite , i feel justified in making the approximation that    @xmath26    for a neutron quasi - particle state , the quadrupole moment can then be written as @xmath27 where the last equation defines the total effective charge @xmath28 and the shell model quadrupole moment is @xmath29 note that the spectroscopic quadrupole moment normally reported in experiments is @xmath30 .",
    "provided that the parameter @xmath31 can be estimated , equ .",
    "[ q_moment ] can be used to simply extract the neutron occupation probabilities from experimental data on quadrupole moments and e2 transition probabilities .",
    "the spectroscopic quadrupole moments and @xmath32 values for the sn and cd isotopes have been measured over a range of masses between the magic neutron numbers @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "table 1 summarizes the experimental excitation energy and @xmath35 value of the @xmath36 states in the even - even isotopes and table 2 lists the measured spectroscopic quadrupole moments of the of the odd - neutron isotopes .",
    "the radial integrals @xmath37 are calculated using the shell model potential of reference  @xcite .",
    "the strength of the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction is taken to be constant @xmath38 .",
    "this is chosen to yield reasonable values of @xmath39 for the @xmath40 states in the lightest sn and cd isotopes where the @xmath41 is expected to be mostly empty and near @xmath42 where it should be filled .",
    "the factor @xmath43 is taken to be the average of the experimental values in the even neutron isotopes above and below the odd neutron isotope being studied .",
    "when both are not available , then the nearest @xmath32 value and the average energy denominator is used .",
    "the extracted occupation functions @xmath39 are given in table 2 and shown in figs.1 and 2 . the uncertainty in @xmath39",
    "is estimated from the uncertainties in the experimental @xmath32 and @xmath44 and does not include the uncertainty in @xmath31 , nor the uncertainty in @xmath19 .",
    ".[tab:1/tc ] experimental @xmath45 of a sequence of cd and sn isotopes .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , > , < , < , < , < , > , < \" , ]     ( color online ) occupation function @xmath46 for the cd isotopes for @xmath47 . ]    ( color online ) occupation function @xmath46 for the sn isotopes for @xmath48 . ]",
    "the extracted occupation probabilities are consistent with expectations with the exception of @xmath49 .",
    "since the @xmath1 orbital can not be less than half filled in @xmath49 , the measured negative quadrupole moment of the @xmath40 level , even with a very large error bar , would imply a major change in structure compared to the other sn isotopes but there is no other evidence for this happening.leaving out @xmath49 , the total effective charge @xmath50 of the @xmath1 quasiparticle states in the sn isotopes , varies relatively weakly , ranging from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , and the occupation probabilities are therefore a roughly linear function of the neutron number n. this is very similar to the model advocated by yordanov et al .",
    ". however , the cd isotopes are more collective as evidenced by the lower energy and larger @xmath32 of the @xmath36 states and consequently the @xmath1 total effective charge @xmath50 is much larger and more variable , ranging from @xmath53 to @xmath54 near mid - shell .",
    "the occupation probabilities have a more complicated n dependence than assumed by yordanov et al .",
    "@xcite despite the remarkably linear n dependence of the quadrupole moments .",
    "it is interesting that the data for the @xmath55 quasi - particle state in the cd isotopes clearly shows that this orbital fills more rapidly that the @xmath56 orbital .",
    "the sn data are consistent with this .",
    "it is a limitation of laser spectroscopy that it can provide information only on the properties of the ground state and isomeric states .",
    "but a great strength is that it can do so with a consistent methodology for long chains of isotopes . since occupation probablities are monotonic though non - linear functions of n in pretty much all models , the data on each isotope propagates information along the whole chain.for example , in the cd isotopes the occupation probability of the @xmath55 orbital is close to @xmath57 by n=63 and this value will only increase with increasing n ; similarly , the occupation probability of the @xmath58 orbital is down to @xmath59 by @xmath60 and will only decrease with decreasing n.    since the coefficients @xmath61 turn out to be small ( always less than 0.03 for the sn isotopes and less than 0.15 for the cd isotopes and much less when @xmath62 is small ) , the weak coupling approximation is reasonable in the present case .",
    "however , calculating the quadrupole moments to first order in @xmath12 also assumes that the quadrupole moment of the collective @xmath36 state in the even isotopes is not too large .",
    "fortunately , this is so . where experimental data are available , @xmath63 ranges from -0.28 b to -0.45 b in cd and is substantially smaller in sn",
    ". the resulting correction to the first order calculation would be less than @xmath64 in the cd isotopes and less than @xmath65 in the sn isotopes .",
    "the value of @xmath31 has a significant uncertainty but it does nt affect the shape of the curves in figs.1 and 2 though it controls the scale of the vertical axis .",
    "the fact that a constant value works well for both isotope chains provides evidence for the validity of the approximation that @xmath66 since the @xmath36 state is expected to be mainly a two neutron quasi - particle state in sn but a mixed proton and neutron two quasi - particle state in cd .",
    "however , the noticeable discontinuity at @xmath67 just below the @xmath34 neutron shell closure may indicate the limitation of the approximation .",
    "it may also be noted that the self - consistent estimate @xcite of the quadrupole interaction strengths gives @xmath68 and @xmath69 . our value is smaller than the self consistent @xmath70 by a factor of roughly four , but this is perhaps not surprising since it multiplies an experimental @xmath32 in equ .",
    "[ q_moment ] which can include various renormalization effects .",
    "i have shown that the measured electic quadrupole moments of a long chain of odd cd and sn isotopes can be simply understood in terms of a weak coupling model . in the model ,",
    "the quadrupole moments are proportional to the occupation probability of the relevant orbitals which can therefore be extracted from the data .",
    "the formula for the quadrupole moment requires the empirical determination one strength parameter ( which is held constant for the two isotope chains ) , but otherwise it involves experimental data and standard values for parameters such as effective charges .",
    "the deduced occupation probabilities agree with expectations except for @xmath49 .",
    "it would be interesting to repeat the experiments on the heavy sn isotopes near the doubly closed shell @xmath71 in order to decrease the large error bars for @xmath72 and to measure @xmath73 .",
