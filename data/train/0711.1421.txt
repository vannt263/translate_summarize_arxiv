    "<S> the long - time behaviors of the velocity autocorrelation function ( vacf ) for sheared fluids are investigated theoretically and numerically . </S>",
    "<S> it is found the existence of the cross - overs of vacf from @xmath0 to @xmath1 in sheared fluids of elastic particles without any thermostat , and from @xmath0 to @xmath2 in both sheared fluids of elastic particles with a thermostat and sheared granular fluids , where @xmath3 is the spatial dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the predictions has been confirmed by our numerical simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> the slow relaxation of the current autocorrelation functions to the equilibrium state is one of the most important characteristics in nonequilirbium statistical physics @xcite@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the long - time tails are caused by the correlated collisions which cause anomalous transport behaviors such as the system size dependence of the transport coefficients @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of such behaviors is still an active subject in nonequilibrium physics . although there is the long - time tail @xmath0 with the time @xmath4 and the spatial dimension @xmath3 even at equilibrium , the tail under an external force such as a steady shear has different feature from that at equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we believe that the viscosity @xmath5 depends on the absolute value of the shear rate @xmath6 as @xmath7 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 for @xmath10 in the sheared ordinary fluids at a constant temperature , where @xmath11 is the newtonian viscosity at equilibrium , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are proportional constants @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results are obtained from the assumption that the current autocorrelation functions for @xmath14 decay much faster than the conventional tail . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , because of the lack of systematic studies in the long time region , we arise the following question : ( i ) _ what are the long - time behaviors of the autocorrelation functions for @xmath14 _ ?    </S>",
    "<S> the system becomes unsteady because of the increment of the temperature due to the viscous heating effect when we add the shear to a system consisting of elastic particles . </S>",
    "<S> we , then , sometimes introduce a thermostat to keep an isothermal steady state of the fluid under the shear @xcite@xcite . we , however , do not know the details of roles of thermostats in the sheared fluids . on the other hand , the sheared granular fluid in which there are </S>",
    "<S> inelastic collisions between particles can be regarded as one type of isothermal fluids , because the sheared granular fluid can keep a constant temperature under the balance between the shear and the dissipation due to inelastic collisions . indeed , our recent paper has confirmed that an unified description of both sheared granular fluids and sheared isothermal fluids with a thermostat can be used for equal - time long - range correlations as long as the systems keep uniform shear flows @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we , thus , arise the second question : ( ii ) _ what are actual relations among the sheared fluid of elastic particles without any thermostats , the sheared isothermal fluid of elastic particles and the sheared granular fluid _ ? </S>",
    "<S> the interest in the role of the long - tails in granular fluids is rapidly growing @xcite@xcite . in particular , kumaran suggested the existence of an interesting fast decay of the autocorrelation functions , @xmath15 in sheared dense granular fluids @xcite , while otsuki and hayakawa predicted that the correlation of the shear stress decays as @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions are nontrivial , but the exponents for the tails are not confirmed in the recent experiments @xcite . on the other hand , the existence of conventional long - time tails in velocity autocorrelation function ( vacf ) has been confirmed , while the absence of long - tail in the correlation of the heat flux is found @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we encounter the third question : ( iii ) _ what is the true long - time tail in the sheared granular fluids _ ?    in this letter , to answer the above three questions we study the long - time behaviors of vacfs in sheared elastic particles with or without thermostats and sheared granular particles . our theoretical method is based on the classical one developed by ernst et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and the theoretical results will be verified from our numerical simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the system consists of @xmath16 identical smooth and hard spherical particles with the mass @xmath17 and the diameter @xmath18 in the volume @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the position and the velocity of the @xmath20-th particle at time @xmath4 are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the particles collide instantaneously with each other with a restitution constant @xmath23 which is equal to unity for elastic particles and less than unity for granular particles . </S>",
    "<S> when the particle @xmath20 with the velocity @xmath24 collides with the particle @xmath25 with @xmath26 , the post - collisional velocities @xmath27 and @xmath28 are respectively given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the unit vector parallel to the relative position of the two colliding particles at contact , and @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the velocity profile is given by @xmath33 in our system , where the greek suffix @xmath34 denotes the cartesian component . in this letter , we discuss the following situations : ( a ) a sheared system of elastic particles without any thermostat , ( b ) a sheared system of elastic particles with the velocity rescaling thermostat , and ( c ) a sheared granular system with the restitution constant @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> we abbreviate them the sheared heating ( sh ) , the sheared thermostat ( st ) , and the sheared granular ( sg ) systems for later discussion . to avoid the consideration of the contribution from the potential terms , we assume that the sheared fluid consists of a dilute gas of particles .    </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in vacfs for @xmath3-dimensional systems @xcite @xmath36 where we have introduced @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the superposition of @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> vacfs are expected to be represented by the fluctuation of hydrodynamic fields around uniform shear flow characterized by the uniform shear velocity @xmath40 and the homogeneous temperature @xmath41 @xcite as @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the fourier transforms of @xmath34-component of the velocity field and the probability distribution function of a tracer particle , the initial peculiar velocity of a particle defined by @xmath47 with the initial velocity @xmath48 , and the initial velocity distribution function , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> here , we should note that the wave number @xmath49 is taken to satisfy the lees - edwards boundary condition @xcite . the validity of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ c2:eq ] ) in the nonequilibrium situations has been verified in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we need to estimate the behaviors of @xmath50 and @xmath44 to obtain vacfs .    </S>",
    "<S> as was shown in the previous studies @xcite , we adopt the linearized hydrodynamics of fluctuating fields around the uniform shear flow to evaluate vacfs . as in the equilibrium case </S>",
    "<S> , we decompose @xmath50 into the longitudinal mode @xmath51 and the transverse mode @xmath52 as @xmath53 , where we have introduced @xmath54 , and @xmath55 with @xmath56 @xcite and @xmath57 . here , @xmath58 is the unit vector parallel to @xmath59 direction . in this letter , we take @xmath60 as @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce @xmath62 , and the time evolution equation of @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 where we have introduced @xmath65 with @xmath66 . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath67 is the fourier transform of the temperature , and @xmath68 is unimportant part of the kinetic viscosity which is independent of the temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the transverse mode @xmath69 is not independent of the longitudinal modes for sheared fluids because of the existence of @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we can ignore the mixing effect by assuming the small shear rate satisfying @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the condition @xmath71 is not satisfied in the limit @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath73 has the infrared cutoff @xmath74 with the system size @xmath75 for the sheared system . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the condition can be used when we assume small enough @xmath76 or high enough initial temperature @xmath77 for sh and st , and @xmath78 for sg , as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the longitudinal mode proportional to @xmath79 is irrelevant for sheared fluids because of the existence of the sound wave in sheared fluids even when we consider sg . </S>",
    "<S> this is contrast to the case of freely cooling granular fluids @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution equation of @xmath44 in sheared fluids is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is unimportant part of the diffusion coefficient , which is independent of the temperature .    from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ u_kp ] ) and ( [ p_k ] ) , it is obvious that the time evolution of the homogeneous temperature @xmath82 plays a key role in the long time behavior of vacf . when we consider a system of sh , the temperature increases by the viscous heating . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the temperature obeys @xmath83 and its solution is @xmath84 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath82 should be a constant for either st or sg from the balance between the viscous heating and the energy dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we reach an important and an unexpected conjecture that the behavior of vacfs for nearly elastic sg is the same as that for st , but is different from that for sh . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between nearly elastic sg and st appears through the fact that the granular temperature in sg is determined by the shear rate as @xmath85 , while the temperature in st is basically independent of the shear rate . </S>",
    "<S> this conjecture is used in the analysis of the spatial correlations in sg @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the solution of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ u_kp ] ) with dropping @xmath70 is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 with @xmath91 for sh , and @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 for st and sg . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p_k ] ) is similarly obtained as @xmath95 $ ] .    substituting these solutions into eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ c2:eq ] ) with the aid of @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , we obtain @xmath99 where we have introduced @xmath100 for @xmath101 . here , we note that the proportional constant in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result - of - c ] ) depends on the restitution coefficient @xmath23 through @xmath68 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ u_kp ] ) and ( [ p_k ] ) . equations ( [ result - of - c ] ) and ( [ my ] ) describe vacfs for the sheared fluids in all - time region .    in the short - time regime </S>",
    "<S> @xmath102 vacfs , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result - of - c ] ) , are reduced to the known result for the fluid at equilibrium ( eq ) @xmath103 for all situations . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the long time behaviors of @xmath104 obtained from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result - of - c ] ) for @xmath105 , which depend on the situations , differ from those at eq .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first consider the asymptotic behaviors of sh for @xmath106 , where @xmath107 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result - of - c ] ) is dominated by @xmath108 . to keep the contribution of this term we introduce the scaled wave number @xmath109 as @xmath110 and @xmath111 for @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , vacfs for @xmath106 approximately satisfy @xmath113 for @xmath8 , while vacfs for @xmath114 are approximately given by @xmath115    next , let us consider the asymptotic behaviors of st and nearly elastic sg for @xmath106 , where @xmath107 of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result - of - c ] ) is dominated by @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the case of sh , we introduce the scaled wave number @xmath117 as @xmath118 and @xmath119 for @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , two - dimensional vacfs of st and sg for @xmath120 are identical to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ long - sh ] ) , while vacfs for @xmath121 are approximately given by @xmath122    it should be noted that the long - time behaviors of @xmath123 for sh , st , and sg differ from those of @xmath39 with @xmath101 only in the case of @xmath8 . to explain this different scaling of @xmath124 </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the scaled wave number @xmath125 or @xmath126 differs from that of @xmath127 or @xmath128 with @xmath129 , and @xmath130 given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ my ] ) is proportional to @xmath131 , which reduces to @xmath132 for @xmath8 , and @xmath133 for @xmath114 . to demonstrate the difference , </S>",
    "<S> let us restrict our interest to st . </S>",
    "<S> in the vicinity of @xmath134 , @xmath130 behaves as @xmath135 for @xmath114 , while @xmath136 for @xmath8 , which lead to the asymptotic behavior of @xmath137 and @xmath138 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we obtain the characteristic long - time behavior of @xmath124 among @xmath123 .    to verify the validity of our theoretical predictions we perform the simulations of hard spherical particle for @xmath8 and @xmath139 . in our simulation , we first prepare the equilibrium state with the temperature @xmath140 at @xmath141 . for @xmath142 , we impose the shear flow by the lees - edwards boundary condition to avoid the shear - band instability , and measure the velocity correlation from @xmath143 , where we have confirmed that the homogeneous shear flow with the temperature @xmath144 is realized . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and the temperature @xmath144 at @xmath143 are set to be unity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the unit time scale is measured by @xmath145 . in our simulation </S>",
    "<S> , the number of the particles we use is @xmath146 for the calculation of vacfs with the ensembles of @xmath147 different initial conditions for @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the number of the particles we use is @xmath148 for the calculation of vacfs with the ensembles of @xmath149 different initial conditions for @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we have already checked that the system size is large enough that any finite size effects are not observed . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the area fraction @xmath150 with the closest packing fraction of particle @xmath151 for @xmath8 and @xmath152 for @xmath10 . the densities @xmath153 we chose might be high , but our method can be extended to high density cases @xcite .     as the function of @xmath4 for st and eq with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) @xmath124 as the function of @xmath4 for st and eq with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) @xmath154 as the function of @xmath4 for sh with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) @xmath154 as the function of @xmath4 for st and sg with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> ( e ) @xmath155 as the function of @xmath4 for st and eq with @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> here , we use @xmath156 , @xmath150 and @xmath157 for sg in ( a)(d ) , and @xmath158 , @xmath152 in ( e ) . the shear rate is chosen as @xmath159 for sh , st , and sg in ( a)(d ) , and @xmath160 for st in ( e ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we use the parameters @xmath161 for @xmath8 , and @xmath160 for @xmath10 in sh , st , and nearly elastic sg . in the case of eq </S>",
    "<S> , we use @xmath162 . for sg </S>",
    "<S> , we use the restitution coefficient @xmath157 to set the temperature unity . here </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the velocity rescaling method for st where the velocity is rescaled for every time duration @xmath163 to keep the constant temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> figures [ c_2d ] ( a ) and ( b ) exhibit the numerical results of @xmath164 and @xmath165 for eq and st with @xmath8 . the theoretical curves in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ c_2d ] ( a ) and ( b ) for st are obtained from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result - of - c ] ) with two fitting parameters for the amplitude and the time scale . @xmath164 and @xmath165 for st deviate obviously from those for eq in the long time regime . </S>",
    "<S> these behaviors for st are almost on the theoretical curves , which strongly supports the validity of our theory . </S>",
    "<S> we also stress that fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ c_2d ] ( b ) evidently supports the existence of the theoretical cross - over of @xmath165 from @xmath166 to @xmath167 , though the numerical cross - over of @xmath164 from @xmath166 to @xmath168 in fig.[c_2d ] ( a ) is obscure . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ c_2d ] ( a ) , we confirm that @xmath169 for st rapidly decreases near @xmath170 to become negative , while @xmath165 is always positive , which is consistent with the theoretical prediction .    figures [ c_2d](c)(e ) show the numerical results of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> all the theoretical curves are obtained from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result - of - c ] ) with one fitting parameter for the amplitude . from figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ c_2d ] ( c ) and ( d ) , we confirm that vacfs for sh , st and sg with @xmath8 are also consistent with the theoretical result . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ c_2d ] ( e ) , we find that vacf for st with @xmath10 deviates from the line @xmath171 and vacf for eq in the relatively long - time region . </S>",
    "<S> the data are on the theoretical curves again , which strongly support the validity of the theory , although the asymptotic behaviors for @xmath120 could not be confirmed .    one may be skeptical about the condition @xmath71 to ignore @xmath70 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ u_kp ] ) , although the agreement between the theory and the simulation is good . for more precise analysis </S>",
    "<S> , one can solve the eigenvalue problem of linearized hydrodynamics around the uniform shear flow @xcite . from the eigenvalue analysis </S>",
    "<S> , the transverse mode @xmath63 can be represented by the linear combination of two eigenvalues @xmath172 and @xmath173 and associated eigenvectors , where we have introduced @xmath174 and @xmath175 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the transverse mode @xmath176 $ ] always exists , and @xmath177 associated with @xmath178 does not exist for two dimensional case while @xmath177 is @xmath179 degenerated for @xmath121 . since @xmath178 and its associated eigenvectors are identical to those discussed in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ u_kp ] ) with neglecting @xmath70 , we should estimate the contribution from @xmath180 and @xmath181 . substituting @xmath44 and @xmath181 with @xmath182 into eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ c2:eq ] ) , we obtain its contribution to @xmath38 as @xmath183 $ ] , where we have used @xmath184 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath185 obviously satisfies @xmath186 for @xmath187 , while the long time asymptotic form for @xmath120 is given by @xmath188 for st , where the proportional constant is @xmath189 \\exp[-\\sqrt{t_h(0)}(\\nu^*+d^*)(k^2-k_xk_y-2k_x^2/3)]$ ] for three dimensional case with @xmath190 and @xmath191 for @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the asymptotic forms of @xmath185 for sh and sg are proportional to those analyzed in the text . therefore , we believe that the contributions from @xmath70 is only the change of the amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the details of eigenvalue analysis will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our result is contradicted with kumaran s prediction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy does not disprove kumaran s scaling , because ours is for dilute nearly elastic sg but his prediction is only valid for sheared dense granular fluids . </S>",
    "<S> however , we believe that our result is still valid even for dense sheared systems . indeed , the universal results between sg and st has been confirmed for the equal - time long - range correlation functions @xcite even for dense systems , when the systems satisfy the uniform shear . </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss the unified description on both the long - range correlation and the long - tail elsewhere @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have analytically calculated the behaviors of vacf in the sheared fluids , which is represented by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result - of - c ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) we have predicted the existence of the cross - over of vacf from @xmath0 to @xmath1 for sheared heating elastic particles ( sh ) , while the cross - over is from @xmath0 to @xmath2 for the sheared elastic particles with a thermostat ( st ) and the nearly elastic sheared granular particles ( sg ) through the hydrodynamic analysis . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) we have also theoretically predicted that the behavior of vacf for st is almost equivalent to that for sg , while sh is different from that of st . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) as stated in ( ii ) , we have confirmed that the hydrodynamic properties of dilute and nearly elastic sg are not unusual , which is contrast to kumaran s prediction @xmath192 .    </S>",
