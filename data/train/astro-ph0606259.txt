    "the zoo of young neutron stars contains a number of categories recognized by the distinct properties of such stars discovered or identified in the last decade .",
    "the existence of these different types of neutron stars strongly suggests that not all neutron stars are born with the same initial conditions , nor do they follow the same evolutionary path as the familiar radio pulsars , of which the typical young example is usually taken to be the crab pulsar .",
    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review of axps and sgrs ) are widely accepted to be magnetars @xcite .",

    "2004 ) and dim isolated ( thermal ) neutron stars ( dtns or dins ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are probably related classes , although the latter are relatively older .",
    "measured rotation periods of axps , sgrs and dins cluster in the narrow range of @xmath0 s. @xcite proposed that the presence or absence , and properties , of bound matter with angular momentum that is , a fallback disk , may be among the initial parameters of newborn neutron stars , in addition to magnetic dipole moment and initial rotation rate . according to this scenario ,",
    "the differences between isolated pulsars , axps , sgrs , and dins , as well as the ccos in certain supernova remnants , are due to different initial conditions , including the presence or absence and properties of fallback disks .",
    "the suggestion that the x - ray luminosity of axps is due to mass accretion from a fallback disk ( chatterjee et al .",
    "2000 ; alpar 2001 ) has triggered searches for evidence of such disks .",
    "searches for fallback disks around axps have been conducted primarily in the optical and near ir bands . a realistic model for a putative fallback disk should take into account the effects of irradiation by the neutron star s x - ray luminosity .",
    "irradiation is the dominant source of disk luminosity for the outer disk at ir and longer wavelengths .",
    "the radial temperature profile of a fallback disk has been computed by perna et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and hulleman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) using the prescription given by @xcite . to estimate the temperatures , both hulleman et al . and",
    "perna et al . assumed the same particular irradiation efficiency and found that their estimated optical flux values lie well above the values indicated by observations of the axps 4u 0142 + 61 and 1e 2259 + 586 . while perna et al .",
    "suggested that the difference might be due to a probable advection - dominated flow at the inner disk , hulleman et al . drew the conclusion that this model can only fit the data for an unrealistically small outer disk radius and that fallback - disk models were ruled out ( see   4 for further discussion )",
    "recent studies show that irradiated - disk model fits to existing detections and upper limits from axps allow the presence of accreting fallback disks with reasonable irradiation parameters for all axps @xcite when the fits are not restricted to a particular irradiation efficiency .",
    "recent results by wang et al .",
    "( 2006 , hereafter wck06 ) from _ spitzer _ data on the axp 4u 0142 + 61 complement earlier data in the near - infrared and optical ( hulleman et al .",
    "2000 , 2004 , hereafter hvkk00 and hvkk04 ) and the detection of pulsed emission in the optical @xcite , thus providing the first instance of a multiband data set that can be tested against disk models .",
    "wck06 interpret their data with a dust disk radiating in the infrared , while the optical data are ascribed a magnetospheric origin .",
    "they take the origin of the x - ray luminosity to be dissipation of magnetic energy in the neutron star s crust , in accordance with the standard magnetar model .    here",
    "we show that the entire unpulsed optical , near - ir , and far - ir spectrum can be explained as due to a gaseous disk whose luminosity is provided by viscous energy dissipation due to mass transfer through the disk , as well as irradiation by the x - ray luminosity @xmath1 from the neutron star .",
    "taking @xmath1 to be an accretion luminosity , as we do , links the irradiation contribution to the disk luminosity with the mass accretion rate @xmath2 and , thereby , the mass inflow rate @xmath3 through the disk and the viscous dissipation contribution of viscous dissipation to the disk luminosity .",
    "luminosity in the optical band comes from the inner regions of the disk and is supplied , to a significant extent , although not fully , by the local viscous energy dissipation in the inner disk .",
    "the innermost disk , which is dominated by dissipation , radiates mostly in the uv band but also contributes to the total optical emission .",
    "extension of the same irradiation model to outer regions of the disk explains the ir radiation .",
    "the disk luminosity is dominated by the contribution of irradiation at outer radii , where the thermal radiation peaks in the longer wavelength bands ( see table 1 ) .",
    "pulsed emission in the optical @xcite is due to magnetospheric emission powered by a disk - shell dynamo in our model .",
    "it has been shown by @xcite that magnetospheric pulsar emission in optical and higher energy bands can be sustained by an outer gap in the presence of a disk protruding into the magnetosphere .",
    "this disk model is different from the first disk - magnetosphere models @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite showed that the pulsed optical emission from 4u 0142 + 61 can be explained in terms of a magnetospheric model with a disk and a neutron star surface dipole magnetic field of @xmath4-@xmath5 g. the magnetospheric emission is nearly 100% pulsed in this magnetosphere - disk model .",
    "the discovery of strongly pulsed optical emission @xcite has generally been perceived as excluding disk models , on the basis of the notion that magnetospheric emission can not survive with a disk protruding into the light cylinder .",
    "the disk - magnetosphere model of @xcite and the application by @xcite are important for fallback - disk models , since they demonstrate that a disk can actually be part of a magnetospheric mechanism that generates strongly pulsed emission .",
    "the clustering of axp and sgr rotational periods between 6 and 12 s was investigated by @xcite , who found that statistical clustering with a spin - down law of braking index @xmath6 2 - 4 implies that the final period of these systems must be about 12 s. this final period does not correspond to reaching the `` death line '' in the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane which reflects the cut - off voltage for magnetospheric emission . within isolated dipole - magnetar models ,",
    "the alternative possibility for reaching a final clustering period , asymptotically , is by magnetic field decay on timescales commensurate with the axp and sgr ages @xcite .",
    "an investigation of various magnetar field decay models ( colpi et al .",
    "2000 ) has shown that having the x - ray luminosity data be associated with magnetic field decay is consistent with only one model , involving crustal hall cascade , and for decay times less than about @xmath9 yr . the presence of a fallback disk provides a natural explanation for period clustering of the axps @xcite , as well as dim isolated ( thermal ) neutron stars ( see , e.g. , haberl 2005 ) and sgrs @xcite .",
    "fallback - disk models do not address the origin of bursts , while magnetar models explain the bursts by employing the energy stored in very strong magnetic fields .",
    "the basic workings of the magnetar models require only local magnetic stresses and energies in the neutron star crust , and they can thus be sustained with higher multipole components of the field , while the period clustering and explanation of torques with a fallback disk require the dipole component of the magnetic field to be on the order of @xmath10-@xmath5 g. hybrid models @xcite with @xmath11-@xmath12 g and @xmath4-@xmath5 g are a possibility that incorporates a fallback disk .    in this paper",
    ", we evaluate the recent observations by wck06 in conjunction with older results (   2 ) .",
    "we show that the data agree quite well with a gaseous disk . in   3 , we estimate the characteristic lifetime of such a disk that has evolved through a propeller phase and find that the disk s estimated age , depending on the torque model , is comparable to the @xmath13 characteristic age estimate taken as if dipole spin - down were effective .",
    "the discussion and conclusions are given in ",
    "recent _ spitzer _ observations of the anomalous x - ray pulsar 4u 0142 + 61 have detected the source in the 4.5 and 8 @xmath14 m infrared bands ( wck06 ) .",
    "we will show that , taken together with the earlier observations in the optical ( hvkk00 , hvkk04 ; morii et al .",
    "2005 ) , these detections are consistent with the presence of a gaseous disk around the neutron star .",
    "the optical detection must have a contribution from the magnetosphere , as implied by the strongly pulsed part of the optical signal , at 27% amplitude in the r band , observed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the strongly pulsed emission from the magnetosphere can be accounted for either with a dipole - magnetar - based magnetosphere with surface dipole field strength @xmath15-@xmath12 g or with a magnetosphere with a disk in it , with @xmath16-@xmath5 g. the disk - magnetosphere model can provide nearly 100% pulsed magnetospheric emission in the optical .",
    "the presence of pulsed magnetospheric emission does not rule out the presence of a disk protruding into the magnetosphere . on the contrary ,",
    "such a disk can be part of the magnetospheric circuit sustaining pulsed emission , as shown by @xcite , and applied to 4u 0142 + 61 by @xcite .",
    "a pulsed component is likely to be present in the b , v , and ir bands .",
    "uncertainties due to an unresolved pulsed fraction that is constant across the bands can not be distinguished from uncertainties in other overall factors such as distance and disk inclination angle .",
    "possible variations in the relative pulsed fractions in different bands should be taken into account in evaluating the model fits .",
    "further , an important uncertainty arises from the interaction between inner disk and magnetosphere , which might distort the inner disk s geometry and thus possibly lead to time - dependent self - shielding at some inner disk regions .",
    "observations of various axps in some of the optical / ir bands at different epochs show considerable same - source variations in relative amplitudes ( see , e.g. , morii et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these variations are not included in our or other scientists model fits , and indeed , it is not feasible to model such effects in a plausible way . keeping this in mind",
    ", we try to obtain the best fit to optical and ir data points .",
    "figure 1 shows the best model fit to all the data .",
    "table 1 details the features of this fit . for each radiation band ,",
    "the effective blackbody temperature representing that band and the radius @xmath17 in the disk corresponding to that effective temperature are listed .",
    "the last column gives the ratio of dissipation- to irradiation - powered disk flux at that radius .",
    "the total emission in each band is predominantly supplied by parts of the disk near the quoted radius , but of course , there are lesser contributions from all parts of the disk . in the best fit displayed in figure 1 and table 1 , the representative radius , @xmath18 cm , that dominates",
    "the v - band emission draws about 30% of its luminosity from viscous dissipation .",
    "the actual inner disk radius in this fit , @xmath19 cm , is almost an order of magnitude smaller than the v - band representative radius . in the inner disk ,",
    "the ratio of viscous dissipation to irradiation - supported flux is therefore higher .",
    "the radiation from the innermost disk is a major contributor to the uv radiation bands .",
    "the innermost disk , from @xmath20 to the v - band representative radius , also makes important contributions to the radiation in the optical bands .",
    "therefore , the fits are quite sensitive to the value of the inner disk radius .",
    "the same disk model accommodates the earlier optical and ir data ( hvkk00 , hvkk04 ; morii et al .",
    "2005 ) and the _ spitzer _ detections by wck06 .",
    "the value of @xmath21 indicated by the best model fit shown in figure  1 is 3.5 .",
    "this is within the reasonable dereddening range @xmath22 for 4u 0142 + 61 ( hvkk00 , hvkk04 ) and coincides , fortuitously , with a recently derived estimate of @xmath23 ( durant & van kerkwijk 2006 ) . for this model ,",
    "all the model flux values remain within @xmath24% of the data points .",
    "the error bars on the b - band data point give the 3 @xmath25 upper limit ( hvkk04 ) .",
    "considering the uncertainties discussed above , the irradiated gaseous disk model is in reasonable agreement with optical and ir data .    in the inner disk ,",
    "viscous dissipation contributes significantly to the disk luminosity , while in the outer and cooler parts of the disk , the luminosity is determined by x - ray irradiation from the neutron star .",
    "notably , the total disk luminosity of a gaseous disk , including both irradiation and the intrinsic dissipation , does not fall off in the optical range in the way expected for a dust disk as employed by wck06 in their figure 3 .",
    "indeed , a gas disk model can explain both the optical and the ir data , as shown in figure  1 .",
    "the earlier conclusion by hvkk00 that an accretion disk is ruled out is no longer valid given the _",
    "these authors ruled out an accretion disk because their optical magnitude , dereddened with @xmath26 , does not fall on the disk curve corresponding to @xmath1 as an accretion luminosity , with certain assumptions , a choice of @xmath3 , and a particular irradiation reprocessing efficiency .",
    "fitting the optical points to the rayleigh - jeans end of a disk blackbody therefore required , on the basis of the ( only optical and near - ir ) data then existing , that any disk in 4u 0142 + 61 be truncated at a certain outer radius @xmath27 .",
    "now , with the new _ spitzer _",
    "observations of wck06 , the disk is actually detected in the far - infrared .",

    "the two mid - ir _ spitzer _ data points put a lower limit on the outer disk radius of around @xmath10 cm , but they do not constrain the extension of the outer disk beyond @xmath10 cm . in our model ,",
    "the outer disk radius is @xmath30 cm .",
    "the quality of the fits does not change for even larger values @xmath27 , since the contribution to the _ spitzer _ bands at 4.5 and 8 @xmath31 m from larger radii is not significant .",
    "the model fits in the optical band are sensitive to the value of the disk s inner radius .",

    "the torque @xmath139 represents the most plausible model , because it incorporates accretion with spindown and yields reasonable ages , together with the torque @xmath95 , for @xmath143-@xmath5 g.    using the observed parameters of 4u 0142 + 61 and torque @xmath139 , the mass inflow rate in the disk , for a given magnetic field strength , can be estimated from equation ( [ tfive ] ) along with the outflow rate @xmath73 .",
    "we find @xmath144 and @xmath145 for @xmath146 g and @xmath147 ( @xmath148 g @xmath39 ) .",
    "note that most of the mass lost by the disk accretes onto the neutron star .",
    "this estimate implies @xmath149 with @xmath150 .",
    "the upper limit set on the lifetime of the disk by employing @xmath139 is much smaller than the lifetime values estimated using the propeller torques @xmath96 and @xmath113 .",
    "the spin - down age of the pulsar estimated with the dipole spin - down formula , which of course can only offer a rough comparison with the present model , @xmath151 yr , is comparable to @xmath152 , the inferred disk lifetime corresponding to the spin - down torque @xmath139 in the accretion regime ( see fig .",
    "this age estimate is also consistent with those for the supernova remnants associated with the axps 1e 2259 + 586 and 1e 1841@xmath74045 .",
    "we conclude that an active disk torquing down the star for an age of @xmath153 yr is a tenable hypothesis , most likely with some accretion for a significant part of its history up to the present .    with the assumption that @xmath139 is a good description of the current torque , one can estimate the fraction @xmath44 of the mass inflow that is accreted , for a given value of the disk inner radius , without having prior knowledge of the mass inflow rate in the disk .",
    "equation ( 9 ) can be written in the form @xmath154 . using the observed spindown rate and the accretion rate inferred from the luminosity ( eq.[2 ] ) , we find @xmath44 = 0.6 for @xmath60 = 10@xmath155 cm and @xmath44 = 0.4 for @xmath60 = @xmath121 = 7 @xmath156 10@xmath157 cm .",
    "by combining earlier optical data ( hvkk00 , hvkk04 ; morii et al .",
    "2005 ) with recent _ spitzer _ infrared data ( wck06 ) , we have shown that the full data set is consistent with the luminosity and spectrum expected from a gas disk .",
    "the optical radiation is powered to a significant extent by viscous dissipation in the inner regions of the disk while the ir radiation comes from outer regions where irradiation by the central source is the primary source of the disk s local luminosity .",
    "what is the maximum dipole magnetic moment @xmath34 that is compatible with these disk model fits to the data ? from equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we obtain @xmath158 using @xmath159 and @xmath160 and employing the maximum @xmath161 cm that is compatible with our fits , for a minimum @xmath63 we find the maximum possible @xmath34 to be @xmath162 g @xmath163 corresponding to a maximum surface dipole field of @xmath164 g on the poles of a neutron star of mass @xmath165 and radius @xmath166 cm . a further increase in the upper limit for the magnetic field can be obtained with smaller values of @xmath44 .",
    "the minimum @xmath44 that allows a fit within 60% v - band deviation is around 0.3 , together with @xmath167 cm . for these extremes of parameter values ,",
    "we obtain @xmath168 g on the pole of the neutron star .",
    "these estimates should be noted together with the uncertainties due to disk - magnetosphere interaction , possible shielding effects , and time - dependent variations as discussed in   2 .",
    "we note that if the disk inner radius is large , @xmath169 , the neutron star is a fast rotator , far from rotational equilibrium with the disk , and likely to be in the strong propeller regime .",
    "if the simple description of propeller spin - down given by equation ( 9 ) is roughly correct , as is likely the case , the large moment arm provided by a large @xmath60 , together with mass outflows at least comparable to ( and probably larger than ) the mass accretion rate onto the star will yield spindown rates much larger than that observed : @xmath170 a disk with @xmath171 cm , which allows for a magnetic dipole as large as @xmath172 3 @xmath173 g , requires a spindown rate of @xmath174 10@xmath175 rad s@xmath176 .",
    "this is much larger than the observed @xmath177 1.7 @xmath178 10@xmath179 rad s@xmath176 .",
    "here we have a strong indication against values of @xmath60 large enough accommodate dipole magnetic fields in the magnetar range .",
    "as our disk models depend only on the mass inflow rate @xmath3 inside the disk and the irradiation parameter @xmath52 , it could be argued that the entire mass inflow actually turns into an outflow and none of the mass flowing through the disk is accreted onto the neutron star , the x - ray luminosity being due to some energy release mechanism other than accretion .",
    "the observation that the inner disk radius in our best fit is so close to the co - rotation radius argues against this .",
    "indeed our fits yield the inner radius required by the optical observations",
    ". the actual inner radius may be even smaller and closer to @xmath121 , but we do not have the possibility of observing such a highly absorbed source in the uv band to check .",
    "the rather small value of the spin - down rate compared with what one would expect with a substantial mass outflow from a larger inner radius also indicates that this is a weak propeller , close to equilibrium .",
    "it is therefore likely that there is mass accretion .",
    "could the disk of our model fits be passive , with no viscous dissipation , no mass inflow , and no accretion at all onto the neutron star ? under this hypothesis , the disk luminosity would be generated entirely by irradiation by the neutron star s x - ray luminosity , which in turn is not due to accretion .",
    "it is unlikely that there is no accretion at all , if there is a gas disk with the properties indicated by our model fits , which are sensitive to the inner disk radius and require temperatures above @xmath180 k in the inner disk .",
    "the disk can not be neutral and passive at these temperatures ; it has to be ionized , whether it is pure hydrogen or contains heavy elements .",
    "an ionized disk would have viscosity generated by the magnetorotational instability @xcite , which will result in mass inflow through the disk and interaction between the disk and the neutron star magnetosphere , as well as some mass accretion onto the neutron star , depending on the closeness to equilibrium .",
    "ionization temperatures for hydrogen disks are of the order of @xmath181 k. for fallback disks with heavy metals ( werner et al .",
    "2007 ) , the ionization temperatures could be as low as @xmath182 k. in hydrogen disk simulations of soft x - ray transients and dwarf novae , two different viscosity parameters are employed above and below the ionization temperatures to account for the observations of these systems . in these models ,",
    "the viscosity parameter decreases by a factor of 0.01 - 0.5 as the temperatures decrease to below the ionization temperature , @xmath183 .",
    "this indicates that even the disk regions with @xmath184 remain active and that the critical temperature below which the entire disk enters a passive state is likely to be much lower than the ionization temperatures .",
    "early studies by gammie ( 1996 ) on protoplanetary disks suggested the possibility that a weakly ionized disk might become passive in its dense regions in the mid - plane while accretion proceeds over its surface .",
    "recent work by inutsuka @xmath185 sano ( 2005 ) , however , indicates the existence of various physical mechanisms that can provide , sustain , and homogenize a sufficient degree of ionization for the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) to work through most regions of a protoplanetary disk even at temperatures as low as 300 k. according to inutsuka @xmath185 sano , once mhd turbulence starts to prevail in a disk , it seems quite difficult to switch it off .",
    "the state of turbulent viscosity keeps the temperature and other parameters such that the ionization level required for mri is self - sustained .",
    "the presence of the disk imposes constraints only on the dipole component of the magnetic field .",
    "the very strong magnetic fields that are employed to explain sgr and axp bursts in the magnetar model may well reside in the higher multipole structure of the neutron star s surface magnetic field . in this hybrid situation ,",
    "dissipation of the magnetar fields energy in the neutron star crust may contribute to the surface luminosity along with accretion . in this case",
    ", @xmath2 will have a value less than that inferred by taking the x - ray luminosity to be fully due to accretion , as in equation ( 2 ) .    the object 4u 0142 + 61",
    "is the anomalous x - ray pulsar with the most detailed optical and ir observations .",
    "it would be of great interest to check and extend the current database with further observations , in particular with _",
    "spitzer_. it is important to realize that magnetar fields in higher multipoles and a dipole field with @xmath186 g , to accomodate a disk with the equilibrium period range of observed period clustering , can coexist in the neutron star .",
    "the search for disks in other axps has also provided some data in the optical and near - infrared that are consistent with gas disk models , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "time - dependent variations in the x - ray luminosity could be smeared out during the x - ray reprocessing at the outer disk . on the other hand , variations in the mass inflow rate",
    "modify the disk emission in the optical bands before the changes have been observed in x - rays , because of varying accretion rates .",
    "any observed signatures in the optical bands followed by similar variations in x - rays with viscous time delays ( minutes to days ) would be a clear indication of ongoing disk accretion onto the neutron star . at present",
    ", 4u 0142 + 61 seems to be the best source with which to test this idea .    finally , we comment on the passive dust - disk model proposed by wang et al .",
    "their detection of 4u 0142 + 61 in the mid - infrared has firmly indicated , for the first time , the presence of a disk around an isolated neutron star .",
    "they fitted the data with a two - component model , using a power law to fit the optical and near ir data , which they ascribe to magnetospheric emission .",
    "this leaves only their recent discovery , the _ spitzer _",
    "detections in the mid - ir band , to be explained by a disk . hence , while the evidence in that band clearly points to a disk , the association of only this narrow - band emission with the disk constrains it to be a dust disk beyond the magnetosphere .",
    "questions arising from this model concern why this disk did not generate some viscosity to extend into an active gaseous disk , how it cooled and remained cold and confined , and whether it is stable against the radiation pressure of the pulsar . with an inner disk radius @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is the light cylinder s radius , such a passive dust disk could be stable against the radiation pressure of the magnetospheric pulsar emission ( eki & alpar 2005 ) .",
    "this stability is valid for @xmath189 for orthogonal rotators and for even wider range for non - orthogonal rotators according to the investigation of eki & alpar ( 2005 ) , the stability issue should be kept in mind for dust disks beyond the light cylinder .",
