    "it is widely recognized that a reliable source of single photons on demand is required for the realization of a variety of quantum information processing applications @xcite . in the ideal case , such a source",
    "is often envisioned as a system capable of emitting a single photon at the push of a button , with spectral and temporal properties engineered in such a way @xcite that it can be used to demonstrate higher - order interference effects with photons emitted from other independent sources @xcite . here",
    "we describe an alternative single - photon source for applications of this kind in which a single photon can be switched out of a storage loop at periodic time intervals .",
    "since these time intervals can be chosen to match the cycle time of a quantum computer , a pseudo - demand source of this kind would be just as effective as a source in which the photon can be produced at arbitrary times .",
    "because of the interest in single - photon sources on both a basic physics and application - driven level , searches for a practical system have been widespread .",
    "a partial list of candidate systems includes the use of single atoms @xcite , ions @xcite , molecules [ 8 - 11 ] , and quantum dots [ 12 - 19 ] , as well as coulomb - blockades @xcite , diamond color - centers @xcite , microwave cavities @xcite , quantum interference systems @xcite , and surface acoustic wave devices @xcite .",
    "strong evidence of photon antibunching has already been demonstrated in many of these systems , and several of them are rapidly being engineered towards the ideal of a `` push - button '' single - photon source .",
    "in contrast to most of these sources of single photons , spontaneous parametric down - conversion is a very convenient source of pairs of photons @xcite . because down - conversion is a coherent process subject to phase - matching conditions @xcite , the photons of a chosen pair",
    "are known to be emitted in well - defined directions with respect to one another .",
    "this aspect of down - conversion has been extremely useful for the generation of heralded single photons , in that the detection of one photon of a pair signals the presence and direction of the other photon with certainty @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , down - conversion has not yet been used as a source of single - photons on demand because the pairs are essentially emitted at random times @xcite .",
    "although the use of pulsed - pump down - conversion restricts the possible pair emission time to known intervals , the actual interval at which the pair will be emitted still can not be chosen on demand .",
    "a potential solution to this problem is illustrated in figure [ fig : basicidea ] .",
    "a pair of photons is emitted by a parametric down - conversion source ( pdc ) pumped by a train of short pulses from , for example , a femtosecond mode - locked laser .",
    "the pair can therefore only be emitted at one of the well - defined times defined by the repetition rate of the pulsed laser , but the specific pulse which actually produces the pair can not be chosen in advance .",
    "once a pair has been emitted , the detection of one of the photons is used to activate a high - speed electro - optic switch that re - routes the other photon into a storage loop .",
    "the stored photon is then known to be circulating in the loop and can be switched out at a later time chosen by the user , providing a source of single - photons on pseudo - demand .",

    "various coaxial cables used to connect these devices imparted an additional 60 ns of delay . therefore , photon @xmath0 had to be delayed by at least 434 ns .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : experiment ] , this was accomplished by launching photon @xmath0 into a 120 m fiber optic delay line ( 3 m brand fs-3224 single mode fiber ) which provided over 500 ns of delay .",

    "an additional half - wave plate ( @xmath12 ) was placed before the pockels cell .",
    "the waveplate was nominally oriented so that it did not rotate the polarization , but it could be re - oriented for various diagnostic tests .    in order to minimize beam divergence and maximize the total number of possible round trips , two 1 m focal - length lenses were used inside the storage loop .",

    "an unfolded version of the storage loop can be viewed as a gaussian transmission line @xcite that could be optimized by their relative positions .",
    "the degree of collimation produced by the output coupler ( fc ) of the fiber delay line was then adjusted in an attempt to mode - match the beam into the storage loop .",

    "an accumulated histogram of the number of coincidence counts as a function of this relative time difference would therefore show a series of possible peaks separated by multiples of the 13.3 ns round - trip time of the 4 m storage loop .",
    "figures [ fig : decay ] and [ fig : peaks ] summarize the results of our proof - of - principle demonstration of a source of single - photons on pseudo - demand from stored parametric down - conversion .",
    "figure [ fig : decay ] shows a histogram of the number of coincidence detections as a function of the arrival time of photon @xmath0 at @xmath24 relative to the arrival time of photon @xmath1 at @xmath3 . for this data , the pockels cell driver",
    "was intentionally disconnected , and the half - wave plate inside the storage loop of figure [ fig : experiment ] was set with its fast axis rotated by @xmath28 with respect to the vertical direction .    upon being reflected into the storage loop by the main polarizing beamsplitter , photon @xmath0 s vertical polarization state",
    "was therefore rotated by @xmath27 ( in this case the pockels cell would do nothing but apply an overall irrelevant phase - shift for any applied voltage ) .",
    "after 1 round trip through the storage loop , the @xmath27 polarized photon @xmath0 therefore had a 50% chance of being reflected out of the loop by the polarizing beamsplitter , and a 50% chance of being transmitted back into the loop for a second round trip .",
    "the transmitted amplitude , which was horizontally polarized , was once again rotated to @xmath27 by the half - wave plate , and the cycle repeated indefinitely .",
    "the accumulated peaks shown in figure [ fig : decay ] therefore provide an excellent diagnostic tool for testing the quality of the storage loop and measuring the magnitude of any detrimental loop losses .",
    "if the loop were perfectly aligned and had no optical losses , we would expect to see a coincidence count histogram that decays as @xmath29 , where @xmath10 is the number of round trips after the first pass through the loop . this ideal case",
    "is represented by the dashed line in figure [ fig : decay ] .",
    "the data was better fit by a decay curve that went as @xmath30 , indicating a loss of 26% per round trip through the loop .",
    "of this 26% loss , roughly 18% could be attributed to the various reflection and transmission losses from the optics forming the storage loop , with the remaining 8% being due to imperfect alignment and focussing of the gaussian transmission line .",
    "this loop loss was lower than initially expected , and evidence of single photons completing up to twelve round trips through the loop was seen in auxiliary experiments .",
    "the main results of this paper are shown in figures [ fig : peaks ] ( a ) through ( d ) .",
    "the data shows coincidence count histograms analogous to that shown in figure [ fig : decay ] , but with the waveplate set to its nominal position to cause no polarization rotation . in these examples , full user - control of the storage and switch - out of single - photons as described in section [ sec : experiment ] was implemented .",
    "figure [ fig : peaks ] ( a ) shows the accumulated counts when the user decided to switch out the photon on command after 2 round trips , while figures [ fig : peaks ] ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , respectively show switching out after choosing 3 , 4 , or 5 round trips .",
    "the integrated area under the peak of interest in each of the successive plots does decay in rough agreement with the 26% loss per round trip deduced from figure [ fig : decay ] . in addition",
    ", small undesired peaks due to switching errors can be seen in each of the four plots .",
    "we believe that these small switching errors were primarily due to the fact that the photon beam was diverging through the pockels cell in the storage loop , making it impossible to apply the correct half - wave voltage to the entire wavefront . in any event , the data shown clearly demonstrates the concept of single - photons on pseudo - demand from stored down - conversion .",
    "in the current experiment , the effects of loop losses and switching errors were relatively small compared to the effects of false triggering events and photon loss errors .",
    "false triggering events arise from the dark - count noise events of the trigger detector @xmath3 .",
    "these dark counts are indistinguishable from real photon @xmath1 detection events and cause the user to mistakenly think that a photon @xmath0 is stored .",
    "similarly , photon loss errors occur when a real trigger photon @xmath1 is detected but the corresponding photon @xmath0 was lost before even entering the loop . in practice , neither of these errors will represent a major drawback for this type of single - photon source , as described below .    in the present set - up , however , both of these errors were significant .",
    "in addition to individual detector dark counts on the order of 200 per second , the single - photon @xmath1 detection rate at detector @xmath3 was roughly 3250 counts per second , while the single - photon @xmath0 counting rate at detector @xmath24 was only 200 counts per second .",
    "furthermore , the observed coincidence counting rate between the two detectors was only on the order of about 10 per second .",
    "most of this difference between the two detectors counting rates was due to the fact that coincidence counting rates here were maximized by fully opening the apertures which defined the path to detector @xmath3 .",
    "since there was photon @xmath0 loss due to coupling inefficiency into the fiber optic delay line , as well as significant losses at a connection between two fiber patch cords comprising the delay line , this strategy helped ensure that for each successfully launched photon @xmath0 , the twin trigger photon @xmath1 would not be lost .",
    "although no serious efforts were made to reduce these losses and errors in our initial experiments , it should be noted that they do not pose serious problems for a practical use of this type of source .",
    "the effects of detector dark counts can essentially be eliminated by the use of femtosecond pulsed down - conversion which allows gating of the sources and detectors .",
    "in addition , the problems associated with photon loss errors here are of the same type as those encountered , for example , in the klyshko absolute detector - calibration scheme @xcite .",

    "an approach to this problem involving the use of an array of low - power pumped down - conversion crystals at each input port is being investigated by migdall and co - workers @xcite . in that approach ,",
    "detectors for one photon of each possible pair and fast - switching are used to select the input photon based on which crystal had successfully emitted a pair .",
    "an approach of that kind would require a large number of efficient optical switches and down - conversion crystals for each input port of the device .",
    "our approach is based on the use of the single - photon source demonstrated in this paper , which essentially requires only two efficient switching events per source .",
    "the experimental results shown in figure [ fig : peaks ] indicate that the source of single - photons on pseudo - demand from stored down - conversion appears to be ideally suited for this task .",
    "as shown in the lower portion of figure [ fig : loqc ] , one source of this kind would be used at each ancilla photon input port of the linear optics device .",
    "the entire experiment would be pumped by a master femtosecond pulsed laser which would provide the required synchronization , as well as reducing the problems associated with dark counts .",
    "pumping of the single - photon sources would be started well in advance of the pre - determined gate - operation time .",
    "each of the ancilla sources would continue to be pumped until a single photon was known to be contained in its storage loop . at the pre - determined gate - operation time , all @xmath31 ancilla could therefore be switched out of their loops , and into their input ports of the linear optics device .    in order to be useful in this linear optics scheme , the photons from each of the independent sources will be required to be indistinguishable in the sense that higher - order interference effects can be observed among them .",
    "at present time , the most practical method for ensuring this indistinguishability appears to be the use of narrow - band pre - filtering techniques proposed by ukowski _ et . al . _ @xcite and used in a variety of multi - photon down - conversion experiments ( see , for example @xcite ) . in the example of figure [ fig : loqc ] , the filtering will need to be arranged in such a way that dispersion and wavepacket distortion can not be used to distinguish photons which have travelled a different number of round trips through their respective storage loops .",
    "an alternative method for ensuring the indistinguishability of the ancilla photons would involve the source engineering techniques described by walmsley s group @xcite .",
    "the development of low - loss optical switches would also be required . despite these technical challenges , the single - photon source on pseudo - demand demonstrated in this paper",
    "may facilitate a near term demonstration of linear optics quantum computation .",
    "in this paper we reported the results of an experiment that demonstrated a source of single - photons on pseudo - demand from stored parametric down - conversion . in our experiment ,",
    "the detection of one photon of a down - conversion pair was used to activate a high - speed pockels cell that switched the other photon into a free - space storage loop .",
    "the stored photon was then known to be circulating in the loop , and could be switched out on command after any number of round trips . from a practical point of view ,",
    "one of the attractive features of this source is that the stored photon is released into a well - defined mode as opposed to the random @xmath37 solid - angle emission found in many single - photon sources based on spontaneous decay of a single excited two - state system .    in the current version of our experiment ,",
    "the minimum length of the storage loop was dictated by the relatively slow 10 ns rise time of the pockels cell switch .",
    "although efforts could be made to reduce this time , we emphasized that the `` push - button '' aspect of any single - photon source is not the critical requirement for many quantum information applications . what is required in many cases is simply to know , with near certainty , that a single photon will be emitted at some pre - arranged time in the future .",
    "the use of the source described in this paper with pulsed - pump parametric down - conversion appears to be an ideal candidate for these applications .",
    "the losses and switching errors in our relatively simple proof - of - principle experiment were lower than initially expected , which is encouraging for the discussion of a photonic quantum memory device based on this kind of storage loop @xcite .",
    "much lower losses should be achievable using suitable optical fiber components .",
    "we also described how such a source of single - photons on pseudo - demand may be ideally suited as a source of ancilla photons in a linear optics quantum computation scheme @xcite .",
    "useful implementations of linear optics quantum computing will require a large number of these types of sources with much smaller errors , but the results presented here provide a significant step in that direction ."
