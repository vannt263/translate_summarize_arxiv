    "there have recently been many proposals for ways to induce energy propagation along a metallic nanoparticle chain .",

    "the dispersion relations of such waves have been calculated by several authors within the quasistatic approximation  @xcite .",
    "this approximation , which assumes that the dipole - dipole coupling is accurately described by electrostatics , is believed accurate when the spacing between particles is small compared to the wavelength of light at a typical plasmon frequency .",

    "we consider particles of the well known magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet ( yig ) . the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction between localized magnetic excitations on these particles leads to propagating magnetic waves , or magnons .",

    "these calculations are analogous to the extensive earlier work , mentioned above , on wave propagation along chains of small metal particles , also within the quasistatic approximation . in this latter work ,",
    "the waves are able to propagate because of the electric dipole - dipole interactions between the plasmonic excitations in the individual nanoparticles .",
    "by contrast , the relevant interactions for the yig particles are _ magnetic _ dipole - dipole interactions . here",
    ", we use the magnetic properties of yig , together with equations of motion describing the interactions of localized magnetic excitations on the particles with the excitations on neighboring particles , to calculate the dispersion relations of propagating magnon waves along chains of spherical or cylindrical yig particles .",
    "recently , other types of magnon waves have been studied theoretically at the interface between a two - dimensional ( 2d ) magneto - optical photonic crystal and a regular 2d gapped photonic crystal  @xcite .",
    "these studies show that one - way edge modes can propagate at the interface and within the band gap of the bulk modes .",

    "<S> we calculate the dispersion relations for magnon waves on a periodic chain of spherical or cylindrical yttrium iron garnet ( yig ) particles . </S>",
    "<S> we use the quasistatic approximation , appropriate when @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the wave number and @xmath2 the interparticle spacing . in this regime , because of the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction between the localized magnetic excitations on neighboring particles , dispersive magnon waves can propagate along the chain . </S>",
    "<S> the waves are analogous to plasmonic waves generated by electric dipole - dipole interactions between plasmons on neighboring metallic particles . </S>",
    "<S> the magnon waves can be longitudinal ( @xmath3 ) , transverse ( @xmath4 ) , or elliptically polarized . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a linearly polarized magnon wave undergoes a faraday rotation as it propagates along the chain . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of faraday rotation can be tuned by varying the off - diagonal component of the permeability tensor . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the possibility of wireless power transmission along the chain using these coupled magnon waves . </S>"
