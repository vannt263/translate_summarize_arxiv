    "[ pic : largextransfer],width=384 ]    [ power ]      in order to derive the power - spectrum analytically we have made a series of approximations .",
    "one important assumption in our analysis is the neglection of perturbations in the decaying field and radiation , which would both enter in the matching conditions .",
    "we plan to relax this approximation in a forthcoming publication  preliminary results show the same oscillations in the power - spectrum with a comparable amplitude ( up to factors of order one ) , resulting in a similar bound on the number of branes .",
    "we ignored other decay channels , for instance the production of cosmic strings at the collision .",
    "the oscillatory corrections to the power - spectrum that we find are caused by the jump in the equation of state parameter and the potential .",
    "these jumps are present regardless of the exact type of decay products ; hence , we expect only minor quantitative changes to the power - spectrum if they were included .",
    "we also worked in a sudden decay approximation , matching two asymptotic solutions at the collision - time . in reality , the decay takes some time which smoothes out all discontinuities while slow roll is briefly violated for the decaying field .",
    "as explained previously , the time scale of tachyon formation and brane annihilation is controlled by the inverse of the warped string scale which is much smaller than @xmath239 during inflation in order for our effective four - dimensional approximation to be valid . in conclusion ,",
    "our result for super - hubble perturbations with @xmath241 is trusted .",
    "however , for wavelengths shorter than the inverse of the warped string scale the transition should be smoothed out .",
    "this in turn may remove the unwanted power spectrum modulation for very small scales .",
    "motivated by the recent interest in inflationary models with more than one dynamical degree of freedom , we investigated the consequences for cosmological perturbations of a decaying field . as a model we chose one of the best understood models of inflation in string theory , the kklmmt proposal , and extended it slightly : instead of driving inflation by one brane that annihilates with an antibrane at the end of inflation , we allowed for two stacks of branes with @xmath1 and @xmath2 branes respectively .",
    "these two stacks correspond to two inflaton fields at the level of four dimensional effective field theory .",
    "if the two stacks are separated initially , the first stack can annihilate with antibranes during inflation , creating closed string loops ( radiation ) in the process ( we ingored other decay channels ) .",
    "we focused on @xmath29 , in which case the produced radiation does not interrupt inflation , but causes a slight jump in the equation of state parameter .",
    "this setup has all the shortcomings of the original kklmmt proposal , i.e.  the back reaction of the volume modulus on the inflaton field @xcite , but it provides a well understood framework to investigate the effects of a brane annihilation and particle creation in detail .    at the perturbed level , we focused on fluctuations of the surviving inflaton field , with the assumption that perturbations in the field corresponding to the first stack of branes are taken over by the produced radiation , which subsequently decay rapidly .",
    "this is our main simplifying assumption .",
    "we also ignored contributions from ir - cascading .",
    "the asymptotic solutions for fluctuations in the surviving field during the two inflationary regimes , before and after the collision , were matched at the time of the collision according to the israel junction conditions .",
    "it is in this matching procedure that the jump in the equation of state parameter enters .",
    "the resulting power - spectrum contains a transfer function , determined by the bogoliubov coefficients . on scales",
    "that are super - horizon during the collision , we find a slightly redder spectrum . on sub - horizon scales ,",
    "the power - spectrum is modulated by oscillations , or a ringing , with an amplitude of @xmath242 .",
    "such a ringing pattern might help explain glitches in the cmb power - spectrum . since these oscillations should not yield corrections bigger than a few percent",
    ", we deduce that the remaining stack of branes needs to be comprised of many more branes than the first stack , @xmath243 . for our probe brane approximation to be valid , we require a large enough background charge , @xmath236 .",
    "it is possible that if several annihilation events were to be superimposed , the amplitude of the oscillations would be reduced and the hierarchy between @xmath244 become milder .",
    "thus , we are naturally lead to the framework of staggered inflation , where many annihilation events are assumed to occur in any given hubble time .",
    "the inclusion of many annihilation events renders a numerical study a necessity , which we plan to come back to in a forthcoming publication .    to summarize , the presence of several dynamical degrees of freedom can lead to additional large contributions to the power - spectrum , such as a ringing pattern , if they start to decay during inflation .",
