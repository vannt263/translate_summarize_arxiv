    "spitzer o , located in the extreme southeast corner of the south pillars , is a far outpost of massive star formation in the carina complex ( figure  [ gallery]_d _ ) .",
    "the cluster is associated with the southern of two c@xmath73o cores in the molecular cloud known as the giant pillar ( figure  [ image ] ) .",
    "although it is near the edge of the cccp field , where the acis sensitivity is lower , spitzer o is nevertheless associated with a surface density enhancement in the x - ray sources ( figure  [ newimage ] ) , which was not listed by f11 on account of its remote location .",
    "spitzer o includes a small ir dark cloud that hosts one of the few examples of an ego found in the carina nebula ( sp10 ) .",
    "this ego appears to be associated with 4 stage 0/i ysos ( table  [ mod ] ) in a tight , linear grouping . extending this line westward along the ir dark cloud ( to the right in figure  [ gallery]_d _ )",
    ", we find a stage ii yso and a candidate low - luminosity ultracompact region , suggesting a time - sequence of intermediate - mass star formation .",
    "further to the west , spitzer o also contains at least one massive star inside a compact region , identifiable as a small bubble outlined in 8  @xmath1 m  emission containing diffuse 24  @xmath1 m  emission from dust heated by the central ionizing source , most likely a late o - type star ( p11 ) .",
    "two similar but slightly less bright  regions , complete with their own ionizing stars , are visible to the north and south of cluster o. all 3 candidate ob stars in figure  [ gallery]_d _ are detected in x - rays , and none appears to have been previously cataloged ( p11 ) .",
    "in  [ ymf_sfr ] , we derived a lower limit on the recent , global sfr in the carina nebula of @xmath5 m@xmath2  yr@xmath6 , averaged over the past @xmath166  2 myr , traced by the ir excess sources included in the pcyc .",
    "feedback from massive stellar winds and radiation has been invoked by many authors as the driver of ongoing star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if triggering by massive stars is indeed the dominant mode of continuing star formation in gmcs that host energetic regions , we can assess its relative importance by comparing the present - day sfr to the historical sfr that produced the massive star clusters that ionize the carina nebula and provide the source of the feedback .",
    "@xcite estimated a total stellar population of 5@xmath167 stars down to the hydrogen - burning limit by extrapolating from the known o - type stars in carina @xcite .",
    "the relative rarity of o stars requires an enormous extrapolation over the imf to reach the low - mass stars that contain the bulk of the mass @xcite .",
    "measurements of the imf among low - mass stellar populations ( from the galactic field and open clusters ) and high - mass stellar populations ( from very massive galactic and extragalactic clusters ) have generally found slopes consistent with the salpeter  kroupa value , but region - to - region variations do exist @xcite .",
    "because very massive clusters with a well - populated upper imf are located at such large distances that individual low - mass stars generally can not be resolved , there has been no simultaneous , self - consistent measurement of the imf from solar - mass stars to the most massive stars .",
    "compounding the problem , theoretical calibrations of the masses of o stars encounter a factor of @xmath99 discrepancy between `` spectroscopic '' masses derived from surface gravity and `` evolutionary '' masses expected from stellar structure @xcite",
    ". finally , in the specific case of the carina nebula the completeness of the sample of known o stars @xcite may be as low as 50% ( p11 ) .",
    "the cccp x - ray catalog itself offers an independent measure of the total stellar population .",
    "the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) has proven to be a reliable tracer of the imf @xcite that is most sensitive to low- and intermediate - mass pms stars .",
    "f11 scale the xlf from the _ chandra _ orion ultradeep project ( coup ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for which the underlying imf is well - characterized @xcite , to the xlfs from 4 distinct broad spatial regions within the cccp and predict a total population of @xmath168 stars above the brown dwarf mass limit . because x - ray detection efficiencies are lower for ysos versus diskless pms stars @xcite and for heavily obscured versus lightly obscured stars ( e.g.  figure  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the simple xlf scaling analysis implicitly assumes that any differences in the global disk fractions or the distributions of x - ray absorption between coup and cccp are negligible .    in figure  [ xlf ]",
    "we present a more detailed analysis of the cccp xlf .",
    "two xlfs , separated according to median energy into lightly - obscured ( @xmath169  kev ) and heavily - obscured ( @xmath170  kev ) samples , were constructed using all cccp sources identified as cluster members that were sufficiently bright to enable the derivation of absorption - corrected luminosities @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "the 410 cccp sources matched to ysos in the pcyc were excluded , as were @xmath171 x - ray detected known or candidate ob stars ( p11 ) .",
    "the resulting xlfs ( figure  [ xlf ] ) are clean samples of diskless pms stars that can be more directly compared to the 839 lightly obscured stars in the coup xlf , the vast majority of which lack circumstellar disks @xcite .",
    "the scale factors between the coup and cccp xlfs are 25 and 20 , for the lightly and heavily obscured samples , respectively , giving a total of @xmath172 diskless cccp cluster members with masses @xmath173  m@xmath2 .",
    "this result is a lower limit due to the assumption that sources for which @xmath114 could not be obtained actually have @xmath114 values below the xlf turnoffs at @xmath174)}\\sim30.6 $ ] and 31.6 for the lightly and heavily obscured samples , respectively ( figure  [ xlf ] ) .",
    "combining @xmath175 diskless stars traced by the xlf ( figure  [ xlf ] ) with @xmath176 disk - bearing ysos predicted by the ymf ( figure  [ ymf ] ) gives @xmath177 young stars for the global carina nebula population , in agreement with the estimates of f11 and @xcite .",
    "the total stellar mass is 4.9@xmath178  m@xmath2  ( the upper bound is computed using the xlf scaling analysis from f11 ) . because the large majority of cccp sources classified as likely carina members @xcite",
    "are associated with the clustered stellar population ( f11 ) , we deduce that the age spread represented by the global xlf is similar to the @xmath7  myr age spreads measured for the major ionizing clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the time - averaged global sfr has been 0.0100.017  m@xmath2  yr@xmath6 over the past @xmath7  myr .",
    "the combined ymf and xlf results above lead straightforwardly to a _",
    "global _ mid - ir excess fraction of @xmath179 among the carina nebula population . compared to the commonly - used @xmath85-excess fraction , this mid - ir excess fraction is much closer to the astrophysical fraction of stars with inner disks .",
    "ysos dominated by circumstellar disks or envelopes do _ not _ separate cleanly from reddened , diskless stars in @xmath17 color - color diagrams ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rw06 ) . applying the @xmath85-excess selection criteria of @xcite to the pcyc sources detected in 2mass @xmath17 ( table  [ obs ] ) , we find that only 36% of mid - ir selected ysos exhibit a @xmath85 excess .",
    "we thus predict a global @xmath85 excess fraction among the carina nebula population of @xmath180 .",
    "this result agrees very well with the @xmath181% global @xmath182-excess fraction reported by @xcite from deep @xmath17 imaging of the cccp stellar population , considering that the x - ray detection frequency is expected to be lower for ysos than for diskless pms stars .",
    "we note that the stellar population in the carina nebula is far from coeval , hence large variations from the @xmath179 global average mid - ir excess fraction are expected among different sub - populations , for example the relatively old tr 15 cluster @xcite has a very low disk fraction ( see figure  [ newimage ] and also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while the very young treasure chest cluster may have a disk fraction near @xmath183 @xcite .",
    "the disk fraction also decreases as a function of increasing stellar mass ( pw10 ) ; the global value is dominated by the numerous low - mass stars , while the ob stellar population generally exhibits a low frequency of marginal mid - ir excess emission that likely is _ not _ indicative of circumstellar disks ( p11 ) .    in the south pillars region , sp10 observed a general pattern of ysos distributed spatially in the cavities between the ends of pillars and the ionizing stars and concluded that when star formation is triggered by feedback from massive stars , ysos are left in the wake of retreating , evaporating pillars and molecular cloud surfaces eroded by advancing ionization fronts . just over 50% of the ysos in the pcyc",
    "are located in the south pillars field presented by sp10 ( figures  [ image ] and [ newimage ] ) .",
    "the wide - field coverage of the vela  carina survey allows us to generalize this picture of ongoing , potentially feedback - driven star formation beyond the south pillars to the entire carina nebula .",
    "if triggering were indeed the dominant mode for ongoing star formation , then the high present - day sfr in the carina nebula would demonstrate that feedback can provide the mechanism for sustaining and propagating star formation throughout a gmc complex .",
    "we caution , however , that while most of the active star formation has migrated outward @xcite , making a clear division between a triggered yso population and the ob stars that provide the trigger would be an oversimplification .",
    "the large concentrations of ysos associated with the central , massive tr 16 and tr 14 clusters ( figures  [ image ] and [ newimage ] ) indicate that these clusters are hotbeds of recent star formation ; they are still being built .",
    "in contrast , the older tr 15 and bochum 11 clusters , both located in the outer regions of the carina nebula , have no associated yso sub - clusters even though both are obvious x - ray star clusters ( figure  [ newimage ] ) . the carina nebula is famous for its evolved super - massive stellar population , @xmath19  car being the capstone , but the numerous ob stars apparently associated with compact clusters or groups of ysos ( figure  [ gallery ] , and see also figure  5 of p11 ) could be as young as a few @xmath91  yr , especially considering that the intense winds and radiation fields of massive stars likely destroy their natal envelopes over very short timescales compared to the disk lifetimes of lower - mass stars @xcite .",
    "the triggered star formation hypothesis is very difficult to test in a region as complicated as carina ; proof would require additional information beyond the observed correlation between ysos and ionization fronts to establish a causal relationship that the ongoing star formation _ could not have occurred in the absence of a triggering mechanism provided by the massive stars_. high - resolution interferometric radio or sub - mm detections of dense , massive , molecular cores that lack active star formation and remain protected from external radiation fields within the carina molecular clouds could provide such evidence .",
    "an alternate hypothesis of turbulence - driven , hierarchical fragmentation and collapse of the carina gmc complex ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) also appears consistent with currently available data .",
    "this idea could explain the cluster - of - clusters morphology of the carina stellar populations and is supported by our results that a large , approximately coeval yso population is widely distributed throughout the carina complex and the present - day sfr is approximately the same as the time - averaged historical sfr . in this scenario ,",
    "feedback from massive stars need not _ trigger _ star formation , but it could _ regulate _ star formation by rapidly sweeping the natal molecular cloud fragments away from young embedded clusters , revealing and even unbinding these yso clusters ( as suggested by sp10 ) over shorter timescales than expected from observations of more pristine molecular cloud environments such as m17 swex ( pw10 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the global star formation history of the carina gmc complex is characterized by an approximately constant sfr of 0.0100.017  m@xmath2  yr@xmath6 over the past @xmath184  myr , perhaps set in motion by the hierarchical collapse and fragmentation of the gmc into a cluster of clusters .",
    "this average sfr has been punctuated by intense bursts of massive star formation .",
    "the largest burst produced the super - massive stellar population in tr 16 , including @xmath19  car , about 34  myr ago ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , followed by a second burst that formed the very massive stellar population in the core of the tr 14 cluster , perhaps as recently as 0.5  myr ago @xcite .",
    "subsequent to the formation of the very massive ionizing clusters , the recent star formation history in the carina nebula has been driven or at least regulated by feedback from the massive stars .",
    "our comparative study in  [ xysos ] between the subpopulations of the pcyc with and without x - ray matches in the cccp catalog @xcite reveals some qualitative trends that provide clues into the origin of x - ray emission in intermediate - mass pms stars . across the @xmath10010",
    "m@xmath2  mass range sampled by the pcyc ( figure  [ ymf_acis ] ) , x - ray emission appears to be activated during the protostellar evolutionary phase , and this emission becomes more readily detectable in relatively evolved stage 0/i objects for which the absorption to the central star is reduced .",
    "it is well - established that the x - ray luminosity of low - mass , t tauri stars increases as they evolve from disk - dominated ( stage / class ii ) to diskless ( class iii ) pms stars @xcite . in stark contrast",
    ", we find that intermediate - mass , disk - bearing ysos continue to produce x - rays as they evolve beyond the stage 0/i phase , but this emission fades away as the circumstellar disks evolve and the central stars pass through a herbig ae / be phase during their approach to the main sequence .",
    "x - ray detections of intermediate - mass , disk - dominated ysos in the mass range 1.64  m@xmath2  are correlated with higher disk mass _ only _ for stars with _ cool _ photospheric temperatures ( figure  [ sii_comp ] ) .",
    "although these stars will arrive on the main sequence as a and b stars with @xmath185  k and fully radiative envelopes , currently they have @xmath186  k and spectral types later than g2 . during their early pms evolution , intermediate - mass stars can thus be regarded , in terms of their stellar structure and surface temperatures , as more luminous analogs of classical t tauri stars , complete with convective envelopes .",
    "we therefore suggest that x - ray emission from intermediate - mass ysos originates in a scaled - up version of the mechanism powering x - rays from t tauri stars ; convection - driven magnetic reconnection activity @xcite . because intermediate - mass stars reach the main sequence within a few myr @xcite , this emission mechanism is available for only a short time compared to low - mass pms stars .",
    "the rapid fading of x - ray emission coincides with the rapid dissipation of the circumstellar disk as the temperature of the central star rises .",
    "this rapidly fading dynamo hypothesis can also explain a puzzling feature of the cccp xlf .",
    "the slope of the lightly - obscured cccp xlf , fitted with a power - law function using the method of @xcite , is @xmath187 , significantly steeper than the slopes of both the the comparison lightly - obscured coup xlf ( @xmath188 ) and the heavily - obscured cccp xlf ( @xmath189 ; figure  [ xlf ] ) .",
    "if the lightly - obscured cccp xlf traces an older stellar population compared to either the coup or the heavily - obscured cccp xlfs , then a relatively rapid decay in @xmath114 among the more luminous , intermediate - mass stars would steepen the observed xlf slope , just as mass - dependent circumstellar disk evolution steepens the observed ymf slope ( figure  [ ymf ] ) .",
    "a similar deficit of stars with @xmath190 steepens the observed xlf slope of the tr 15 cluster @xcite . with an age @xmath184  myr ,",
    "tr 15 represents a significantly older stellar population compared to either the onc or the other massive clusters in the carina nebula .",
    "we have used the  vela  carina point - source lists , in combination with complementary ir datasets , to carry out an unbiased search for ysos with ir excess emission throughout the carina nebula .",
    "we produce a pan - carina yso catalog ( pcyc ) of 1439 highly - reliable candidate ysos , 410 of which have x - ray counterparts from the cccp catalog .",
    "the pcyc comprises one of the largest samples of intermediate - mass ysos in a single massive star - forming complex compiled to date , and it is the largest such collection with a complete set of complementary x - ray observations . from our initial analysis of this rich dataset ,",
    "we can draw the following conclusions :    * the mass function ( ymf ) of the carina ysos exhibits a power - law slope @xmath191 , significantly steeper than the salpeter  kroupa imf .",
    "such a steep slope , first observed for the yso population of the m17 swex ir dark cloud , is at least partially the result of an observational selection effect caused by rapid disk evolution among intermediate - mass ysos ( pw10 ) .",
    "m17 swex and carina are very different environments ; the former is a cold , ir dark cloud apparently experiencing its first wave of star formation while the latter is an evolved region powered by some of the most massive stars in the galaxy . while the ymf slopes are similar , the lower critical mass of the pcyc sample , below which the ymf may agree with a normal salpeter ",
    "kroupa imf , likely reflects a larger age spread among the ysos in the carina nebula . *",
    "the time - averaged global sfr in the carina complex has been 0.0100.017  msun  yr@xmath6 over the past @xmath192  myr , punctuated by intense bursts of activity that produced the very massive stellar populations in the tr 16 and tr 14 clusters .",
    "if the present - day galactic sfr is a few m@xmath2  yr@xmath6 , then the star formation activity of the entire milky way is equivalent to a few hundred carina complexes .",
    "the cluster - of - clusters pattern of star formation in the carina nebula is consistent with hierarchical fragmentation and collapse of a gmc complex @xcite . *",
    "the present - day global star formation rate in the carina complex is @xmath5  m@xmath2  yr@xmath6 .",
    "the massive central ionizing clusters tr 16 and tr 14 still host intense concentrations of ongoing star formation .",
    "ongoing star formation activity is distributed widely throughout carina , driven or regulated by feedback from the massive stellar population , which acts to quickly reveal and even unbind young , embedded clusters ( sp10 ) . *",
    "the pcyc includes 62 candidate x - ray - emitting stage 0/i ysos , a sample large enough to provide statistical evidence that x - ray detections correlate with more evolved protostars .",
    "our results support previous findings that the physical mechanism producing x - rays in pms stars is activated during the protostellar evolutionary phase , and circumstellar material contributes significantly to the absorption of x - rays from the youngest ysos @xcite . *",
    "the apparent x - ray emission from intermediate - mass ysos is usually consistent with the presence of unresolved , low - mass companions .",
    "but we also isolate a class of intermediate - mass stage ii ysos with cooler photospheres and relatively massive circumstellar disks for which the x - ray emission appears to be intrinsic .",
    "we suggest that the progenitors of herbig ae / be stars produce x - rays during their early pms evolution , perhaps powered by magnetic reconnection activity during a convective atmosphere phase , but this mechanism decays as the stars approach the main sequence . a rapid fading of the stellar dynamo could thus act to steepen observed xlf slopes as a function of increasing cluster age @xcite . *",
    "we identify 3 new very young , tight yso sub - clusters in the northwestern region of the carina nebula , 2 of which are associated with significant concentrations of x - ray sources ( f11 ) .",
    "the full pcyc dataset is available in the electronic versions of tables  [ obs ] and [ mod ] .",
