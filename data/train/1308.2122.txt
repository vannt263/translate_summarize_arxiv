    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for further references .",
    "the present work is motivated by a specific application of tropical algebra to the verification of real - time systems .",
    "indeed , a remarkable property of tropical polyhedra is their ability to concisely encode possibly non - convex sets expressed as disjunctions of closed zones .",
    "closed zone _ , also known in the literature as _ polytrope _ , is a set of vectors @xmath12 defined by inequalities of the form @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , for certain constants @xmath16 .",
    "more generally , zones are obtained by replacing some of the previous inequalities by strict ones .",
    "see the right - hand side of figure  [ fig : zone ] for an illustration .",
    "zones are extensively used in the area of verification of real - time systems , where these systems are modelled by formalisms such as  timed automata  @xcite or timed petri nets  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , zones are used by model checking tools as _ symbolic states _ , typically representing infinitely many states of the system .",
    "they can be represented using difference - bound matrices ( dbm ) , which are essentially adjacency matrices of weighted graphs .",
    "this allows for efficient algorithms for the manipulation of zones during the verification process .",
    "an inherent drawback of zones is that they are convex sets , and consequently they are not closed under set union .",
    "this means that during the analysis process , symbolic states can not generally be combined , which potentially leads to state - space explosion . due to this",
    ", tropical polyhedra have been proposed in  @xcite as a replacement for zones . however , an important drawback in this approach is that the analysis of timed automata often requires to express strict constraints , for instance in the analysis of communication protocols  @xcite , while tropical polyhedra are by definition topologically closed .",
    "an example illustrating these drawbacks will be given in section  [ sec : tropical_reachability_analysis ] .      in this paper",
    "we first introduce ( section  [ sec : mixed_constraints ] ) a class of non - necessarily closed tropically convex sets .",
    "this class is called _ tropical polyhedra with mixed constraints_. it can express not only inequalities of the form   in which the relation @xmath17 has been replaced by @xmath18 , but also finer constraints exploiting the disjunctive character of tropical inequalities .",
    "for instance , the inequality @xmath19 is going to represent the disjunction of the inequalities @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "these _ mixed inequalities _ are defined using coefficients in a semiring of affine germs , which represent infinitesimal perturbations of reals .    in the second place",
    ", we present a tropical counterpart of fourier - motzkin elimination ( section  [ sec : fourier_motzkin ] ) .",
    "it provides a constructive method to show that the projection in @xmath22 of a tropical polyhedron with mixed constraints @xmath23 is a polyhedron with mixed constraints ( theorem  [ th : fourier_motzkin_maxplus_case ] ) .",
    "it computes a representation by mixed inequalities of the projection by combining the defining inequalities of @xmath24 . actually , this approach handles more generally systems of inequalities with coefficients in a totally ordered idempotent semiring , modulo some assumptions .",
    "note that such an analogue of fourier - motzkin algorithm has not been considered previously in the tropical setting , even in the case of standard ( closed ) tropical polyhedra .",
    "fourier - motzkin elimination also appears as a useful tool to show the polyhedral character of some non - closed tropically convex sets . as an application",
    ", we indeed prove that tropical polyhedra with mixed constraints are precisely the tropically convex union of finitely many zones , and the intersection of finitely many tropical hemispaces (  tropically convex sets whose complements are also tropically convex , which were studied in  @xcite ) , see theorem  [ th : union_of_zones ] and corollary  [ cor : intersection_of_hemispaces ] .",
    "superfluous inequalities may be produced by fourier - motzkin algorithm , so that the size of the constraint systems can grow in a double exponential way during consecutive applications of the method . in order to eliminate such redundant inequalities , in section  [ subsec : elimination_step ]",
    "we extend to mixed inequalities a result of  @xcite and its subsequent refinement in  @xcite , building on techniques of these two papers .",
    "the result of  @xcite shows that deciding the feasibility of a system of tropical linear inequalities is ( karp ) polynomial - time equivalent to solving mean payoff games .",
    "the result of  @xcite shows that deciding logical implications over tropical linear inequalities is also equivalent to solving mean payoff games .",
    "theorem  [ th : equivalence_mpg ] generalizes these two results to mixed inequalities .",
    "we note that the present approach ( through germs ) also yields an alternative , simpler derivation of the result of  @xcite . indeed , deciding whether a given inequality of the form   is logically implied by a system of other inequalities of the same kind",
    "amounts to checking if the intersection of a tropical polyhedron with the complement of a closed half - space is empty or not .",
    "such an intersection is obviously a tropical polyhedron with mixed constraints .",
    "experimentally efficient algorithms have been developed to solve mean payoff games , but no polynomial time algorithm is known .",
    "hence we also provide a weak criterion which allows to eliminate some of the superfluous inequalities in polynomial time ( section  [ subsec : weak_criterion ] ) .",
    "we prove that , in the case of non - strict inequalities , this weak elimination is sufficient to obtain a _",
    "single_-exponential bound for fourier - motzkin elimination ( section  [ subsec : complexity ] ) .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : tropical_reachability_analysis ] illustrates the application of tropical polyhedra with mixed constraints to the verification ( reachability analysis ) of timed automata .",
    "we show that the operations necessary for forward exploration of timed automata can be defined on tropical polyhedra with mixed constraints , using fourier - motzkin elimination and the algorithms developed to eliminate redundant inequalities .",
    "the algorithms developed so far for tropical polyhedra usually benefit from the fact that these can be represented either _ externally _ , using inequalities ( as in  ) , or _ internally _ , as sets generated by finitely many points and rays ( see  @xcite for details ) . in contrast , non - closed tropically convex sets may not be finitely generated .",
    "generating representations of ( non - necessarily closed ) tropical convex cones have been studied in  @xcite , and in  @xcite in the particular case of tropical hemispaces .",
    "a certain class of possibly infinite generating representations was treated in  @xcite , however , the associated algorithms rely on the expensive presburger arithmetic . defining non - closed polyhedra using infinitesimal perturbations of generators also presents some difficulties , see remark  [ remark : generators ] below .",
    "moreover , we should warn the reader that some geometric aspects of tropical polyhedra , in particular the notion of faces , are still not yet understood  @xcite .",
    "thus it does not seem easy to manipulate non - closed polyhedra from closed ones by excluding some `` facets '' or `` edges '' .",
    "the present tropical fourier - motzkin algorithm may be thought of as a dual of the tropical double description method  @xcite , in which one successively eliminates inequalities rather than variables . in both algorithms , redundant intermediate data ( inequalities or generators )",
    "are produced , and the key to the efficiency of the algorithm lies in the dynamic elimination of such data .",
    "redundant generators can be eliminated in almost linear time using a combinatorial hypergraph algorithm , however the hypergraph criterion appears to have no natural dual analogue which can detect redundant inequalities .    as mentioned above",
    ", the equivalence between mean payoff games and the emptiness problem for tropical polyhedra with mixed constraints generalizes a result of  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it generalizes an earlier result  @xcite concerning finite solutions of a class of non - strict disjunctive constraints appearing in scheduling .",
    "the non - strict inequality satisfiability problem has also been studied under the name of `` max - atom problem '' in  @xcite , with motivations from smt solving .",
    "note here a fundamental difference between strict and non - strict constraints : in the latter case , for inequalities with integer coefficients , it is shown in  @xcite that emptiness over the integers is equivalent to emptiness over the reals .",
    "the same is not true for strict inequalities ( consider for example the open hypercube @xmath250,1[^n$ ] which is non - empty , but contains no integer points ) , so that the present result for mixed inequalities can not be deduced from earlier ones .",
    "the infinitesimal perturbation of reals used in mixed inequalities is based on a semiring of affine germs , which was used in  @xcite to provide policy iteration based methods to solve mean payoff games",
    ". it also appeared in the context of tropical linear programming , see  @xcite .",
    "the idea here is that germs allow one to determine algebraically the value of a perturbed game .",
    "related perturbation or parametric game ideas were used in  @xcite .",
    "in the semiring @xmath26 , addition and multiplication admit neutral elements , namely @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "addition does not generally admit inverses .",
    "in contrast , any non - zero ( in the tropical sense ) element @xmath29 admits a multiplicative inverse , which is given by @xmath30 and will be denoted @xmath31 .",
    "the semiring operations are extended to vectors and matrices in the usual way , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we will work in the semimodule @xmath34 , for @xmath35 .",
    "its elements can be seen as points or vectors and are denoted @xmath36 , @xmath37 , _ etc_. the order @xmath17 on @xmath38 is extended to vectors entry - wise .",
    "we equip @xmath38 with the topology induced by the metric @xmath39 , and @xmath34 with the product topology . in the sequel",
    ", we also use the completed max - plus semiring @xmath40 , with the conventions @xmath41 for all @xmath42 , @xmath43 if @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "finally , given a positive integer @xmath46 , we denote by @xmath47 $ ] the set @xmath48 .    the notion of convexity can be transposed to tropical algebra .",

    "@xmath50 joining any two points @xmath51 and @xmath52 of @xmath49 .",
