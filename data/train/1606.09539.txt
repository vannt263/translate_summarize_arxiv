    "the main focus of this work is numerical integrators for stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) with multiscale coefficients .",
    "sdes have been used ubiquitously in many areas to model dynamical systems under random perturbations due to e.g. , extrinsic noises caused by thermal fluctuations , the degrees of freedom that are not explicitly tracked by the system , or perhaps some intrinsic randomness of the system . due to their wide applications , numerical solution to sdes has been an active area of research in numerical analysis and applied probability .",
    "while our results can be used in other scenarios , the main motivation of this work is to design numerical integrators for sdes arising from recent works on irreversible langevin sampling @xcite . in those works ,",
    "an irreversible drift term is added to the overdamped langevin dynamics ( details will be specified in section  [ sec : hmm ] ) , and it is proved that under the proper assumptions the sampling efficiency increases as the magnitude of the irreversible drift goes to infinity , which is validated by numerical studies , see @xcite . however , at the same time , when a large irreversible drift is added to the original overdamped langevin equation , the stiffness of the system is inevitably increased , and thus prevents the application of standard numerical integrators to the resulting systems .",
    "the goal of this work is to study multiscale integrators that allow to enlarge the magnitude of the irreversible drift without having to sacrifice the stability of the numerical algorithm .    for sdes with multiscale coefficients",
    ", it is well understood that we shall take into account the multiscale structure in order to design better integrators ( see e.g. , the books @xcite ) .",
    "the key idea is to use the averaged limit of the sde when the scale is well separated .",
    "hence , it is not necessary to accurately resolve the scales of the original system , but we can rather work with the averaged limit .",
    "this has been the underlying principle of the heterogeneous multiscale methods ( hmm ) @xcite , in particular see @xcite for its applications to stochastic differential equations .",
    "other numerical approaches for stiff sdes were also developed in @xcite .",
    "our numerical scheme follows the ideas of the flavors method developed in @xcite , which on the algorithmic level is very similar to the seamless version of hmm method developed in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to use a split - step integrator which combines a short time integration of the whole sde and a longer time integration of the sde without the stiff terms .",
    "the numerical analysis of such schemes @xcite shows that in the case that the variables of the sdes can be one - to - one mapped to a set of `` fast '' and `` slow '' variables , the numerical scheme converges to the averaged limit which consists of the dynamics of the slow component .",
    "we emphasize that the algorithm does not require explicit knowledge of the mapping that transforms the system into fast and slow variables , while it does require the forcing terms of the sde can be separated into stiff and non - stiff terms .    the main contribution of this work is to extend the analysis of @xcite to situations that a one - to - one mapping of the original degree of freedom into fast and slow variables is not possible . in particular , for the irreversible langevin sampling the function @xmath0 that maps the configurational space to the energy is clearly not one - to - one .",
    "in fact , it is well known that in the limit the sde converges to a diffusion on an associated graph @xcite , for which besides the energy , one has to add the index variable to represent the state space .",
    "our main result proves that the multiscale integrator converges to a diffusion on graph as the scale separation parameter tends to infinity and the discretization parameters are appropriately chosen . in the one",
    "well case , our proof follows ideas of @xcite appropriately adjusting for the different limiting behavior that we have here .",
    "then , the results are being extended to the multiple well case by using techniques similar to those of the classical averaging techniques of @xcite .",
    "however , since we work in the discrete time framework and not in the continuous time framework , we need to obtain bounds with explicit dependence on the discretization parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we will introduce the sdes from the irreversible langevin sampler and the hmm multiscale integrator in section  [ sec : hmm ] .",
    "some numerical results are presented in section  [ sec : numerics ] to validate the method .",
    "the averaging results of the sdes , in particular , convergence to the diffusion on graphs are recalled in section  [ sec : averaging ] .",
    "the main results and the proofs are given in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "consider the overdamped langevin equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a given potential , @xmath3 is the inverse temperature , and @xmath4 is the standard multi - dimensional wiener process . see section  [ sec : averaging ] for conditions on @xmath0 .",
    "the overdamped langevin dynamics is often used to sample the boltzmann - gibbs measure , given by @xmath5 which is the invariant measure of under mild conditions . note that the infinitesimal generator of is self - adjoint with respect to the invariant measure , and",
    "thus the dynamics is reversible in time , _",
    "i.e. _ , it satisfies detailed balance .    in @xcite ,",
    "it was proposed to add to the overdamped langevin dynamics an irreversible forcing to accelerate the sampling , the resulting dynamics reads @xmath6 { \\,\\mathrm{d}}t + \\sqrt{2 \\beta } { \\,\\mathrm{d}}w_t\\ ] ] with some initial condition @xmath7 .",
    "the invariant measure is maintained if the vector fields @xmath8 satisfies @xmath9 , or equivalently @xmath10    a convenient choice , which we assume henceforth , is to pick @xmath8 such that @xmath11    this is not the most general choice for @xmath8 , but it has the advantage that allows to choose @xmath8 independently of @xmath12 . one such choice of @xmath13 is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is any antisymmetric matrix .",
    "these conditions mean that the flow generated by @xmath8 preserves lebesgue measure since it is divergence - free , at the same time , since @xmath0 is a constant of the motion , the micro - canonical measure on the surfaces @xmath16 are preserved as well .",
    "the amplitude of the irreversible drift in is chosen to be @xmath17 .",
    "we will consider the regime that @xmath18 .",
    "using the large deviation action functional of the empirical measure , it is shown in @xcite that the dynamics converges faster to the invariant measure for a larger irreversible drift , i.e. , as @xmath19 becomes smaller . from another point of view , as will be recalled in section  [ sec : averaging ] , in the limit @xmath20 , the slow component associated to the solution of the sde converges to the averaging limit which is a diffusion on an associated graph , and hence the entropy associated with the iso - surfaces of @xmath0 is completely removed and only the energetic barrier is left in the limit . in @xcite",
    "it is also established that the asymptotic ( as @xmath21 ) variance of the estimator is decreasing in @xmath19 and in the limit as @xmath22 , it converges to the asymptotic ( as @xmath21 ) variance of the corresponding sampling problem on the graph where the limiting diffusion lives .",
    "increasing the irreversible drift however comes with a price : the right hand side of the sde becomes rather stiff as @xmath20 , and as a result , standard integrators ( for example the euler - maruyama scheme ) would require vanishingly small time step size to resolve the fast scale of the dynamics .",
    "as @xmath19 goes to zero , the sde contains multiple time scale , and thus it is better to use multiscale integrators for such dynamics .    in this work",
    ", we investigate a multiscale integrator for stiff sdes as proposed in @xcite , which is also rather close to the seamless version of hmm scheme @xcite . for a macro time step @xmath23 and micro time step @xmath24 such that @xmath25 , from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , we evolve the dynamics    @xmath28 { \\,\\mathrm{d}}t + \\sqrt{2 \\beta } { \\,\\mathrm{d}}w_t & &   \\qquad   t \\in [ t_n , t_n + \\tau ) ; \\\\    & { \\,\\mathrm{d}}{\\widebar{z}}_t = - \\nabla u({\\widebar{z}}_t )   { \\,\\mathrm{d}}t + \\sqrt{2 \\beta } { \\,\\mathrm{d}}w_t & &   \\qquad   t \\in [ t_n + \\tau , t_n + \\delta).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this can be understood as a split - step time integrator where for the short time step @xmath24 we use the whole sde and for the long time step @xmath29 we neglect the irreversible drift .",
    "the equations above can be integrated using standard numerical schemes , and for definiteness , in this work we will discretize using the standard euler - maruyama method , which gives    [ eq : hmmintegrator ] @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are independent standard normal random variables .    as will be discussed in sections",
    "[ sec : averaging ] and [ sec : analysis ] , if the dynamical system @xmath33 does not have a unique invariant measure on each connected component of the level sets of @xmath34 and the dimension is bigger than two , then one needs to modify the scheme by considering an additional regularizing noise , see ( [ eq : integrator1])-([eq : hmmscheme ] ) .",
    "we will show that with proper choices of the time steps @xmath24 and @xmath23 as @xmath20 , the numerical scheme converges to the diffusion on graphs , which is the averaging limit of .",
    "thus , we may use to numerically discretize the sde which is consistent in the asymptotic regime as @xmath20 .",
    "let us remark that it is also possible to use multiple micro steps with length @xmath24 rather than just one such step as in , which is analogous to the original hmm integrators .",
    "for the purpose of sampling invariant measure , one could also combine the integrator with metropolis adjustment steps as in the mala method @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the numerical analysis of the scheme and leave these extensions to future works .",
    "before we turn to the analytical results , let us present a few numerical tests for the multiscale integrator .",
    "we will first consider the sampling efficiency of the irreversible langevin sampler with the multiscale hmm integrator .",
    "we will then show some numerical examples illustrating properties of the integrator .",
    "we limit ourselves to simple toy examples as the focus is to demonstrate the numerical properties of the integrator and validate the numerical analysis results , rather than applying to scheme to realistic problems .    for the first test",
    ", we consider a @xmath35 symmetric double well potential given by @xmath36 with inverse temperature @xmath37 .",
    "we choose @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "the initial condition is set to be the origin , and we consider the empirical average of the observable @xmath40 over the time interval @xmath41 $ ] with a burn - in period @xmath42 . to test the performance of the sampling scheme based on the multiscale integrator , we compare the empirical average with the true average of the observable with respect to the invariant measure .",
    "note that in this case , due to the choice of the potential and the observable , the true average is explicitly given by @xmath43 .",
    "we also estimate the asymptotic variance of the sampling scheme by dividing the sampled data points into @xmath44 batches .",
    "denote the sampling error ( with respect to the observable @xmath45 ) as @xmath46 and the asymptotic variance ( with respect to the observable @xmath45 ) as @xmath47 .",
    "the numerical results for various choice of @xmath19 are shown in table  [ tab : doublewell ] , in which we also include the results for direct euler - maruyama discretization for comparison . in these tests ,",
    "we fix the macro time step @xmath48-@xmath49 ( for the direct euler - maruyama discretization , @xmath23 is the time step size ) , and choose the micro time step @xmath50 . for a given set of parameters , we report the mean and standard deviation estimated form @xmath51 independent runs of the algorithms .",

    "the trajectory is plotted at the end of every macro step ( so on the interval of @xmath23 ) .",
    "the plot focuses on the time period @xmath64 $ ] during which the trajectory mainly stays in the left portion of the phase space @xmath65 .",
    "as can be clearly observed from the figure , while the solution of the sde oscillates very fast , the potential energy @xmath0 changes much more slowly , which suggests that @xmath0 is a slow variable in the averaging limit .",
    "it is clear that the map from @xmath66 to @xmath0 is not one - to - one in these examples . for the double well potential , below the energy of the saddle point @xmath67 ,",
    "the isopotential curve is disjoint and separated into the left and right half - planes corresponding to the two minima of the potential at @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which are represented on the corresponding graph of the potential as two separated edges that meet at the interior vertex @xmath70 corresponding to the saddle point ( see section  [ sec : averaging ] where these concepts are recalled ) .",
    "therefore , to get from one component of the isopotential curve to the other , the trajectory has to go up in energy and cross the interior vertex ; when the energy is decreased from above @xmath71 , the trajectory would go into one of the edges , corresponding to one of the disjoint components .",
    "in fact , such an event of energy goes above the saddle point energy can be observed already in figure  [ fig : traj ] around @xmath72 , where the energy first goes up and when it drops down , the trajectory goes back to the same potential well ( on the left half - plane ) .    to see how the multiscale integrator captures diffusion across the interior vertices on the graph , we record the number of transitions to each edge with lower energy connecting to the saddle point when the energy of the trajectory is decreasing from above that of the vertex . for the double well potential",
    ", we count the transitions into each component for a long trajectory with total time @xmath73 ( with burn - in time @xmath42 ) when the energy decreases from above @xmath71 .",

    "note that the empirical probability of going to the left well is @xmath79 , very close to the theoretical value of the diffusion on the graphs ( which is @xmath80 due to the symmetry ) . while the data reported is only for one realization ,",
    "this is the typical behavior observed for the algorithm .    in comparison ,",
    "let us now consider a similar test for a tilted double well potential ( so that the symmetry is broken ) : @xmath81 the tilting by @xmath82 moves the local minima and the saddle point of the potential to approximately @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "we repeat the same calculation as in the symmetric double well case and obtain @xmath86 so that the empirical probability of going to the left well is @xmath87 . due to the asymmetry , it is less likely to go to the left well when the energy decreases from above the value of the saddle point .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretical results for the multiple well case that we will establish in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
