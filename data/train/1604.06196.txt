    "_ massive mimo _ ( multiple input multiple output ) and _ small cell _ are recognized as two key technologies for 5 g wireless systems due to their great potential to enhance network capacity  @xcite . in a massive mimo ( also known as large - scale mimo or very large mimo ) system , the base station ( bs )",
    "is equipped with more than 100 antennas and serves multiple users with the same spectrum band  @xcite . with aggressive spatial multiplexing",
    ", a massive mimo can dramatically improve both energy and spectral efficiency compared to traditional wireless systems  @xcite .",
    "small cell deployment achieves high signal to noise ratio ( snr ) and high spectrum spatial reuse due to short transmission distance and small coverage area . as a result ,",
    "a heterogeneous network ( hetnet ) with small cells can significantly boost network capacity compared to traditional macrocell network .",
    "due to these benefits , massive mimo hetnet , which integrates these two techniques , has drawn considerable attention recently  @xcite . in a massive mimo hetnet ,",
    "multiple small cell bs s ( sbs ) coexist with a macrocell bs ( mbs ) equipped with a large number of antennas . due to spectrum scarcity in cellular networks ,",
    "small cells are expected to share the same spectrum band with the macrocell , resulting in cross - tier interference . while interference management in a regular hetnet mainly focuses on resource allocation in the time - frequency domain  @xcite",
    ", the spatial characteristics of massive mimo can be exploited to mitigate interference in massive mimo hetnets . in  @xcite",
    ", a spatial blanking scheme was proposed in which the transmission energy of mbs is focused on certain directions that do not cause interference to small cells . in  @xcite , a reversed time division duplex ( rtdd ) architecture was introduced .",
    "since the channels between mbs and sbs s are quasi - static , the mbs can carry out zero - forcing beamforming based on the estimated channel covariance . in  @xcite",
    ", coordinated transmission is assumed between mbs and sbs s , so that each user receives signals from both mbs and sbs s . through",
    "coordinated beamforming vectors for the bs s , the interference between different transmissions can be minimized .    in this paper , we consider interference management in massive mimo hetnets from the perspective of antenna array processing techniques .",
    "the idea is to identify the directions of interference sources , and then the interference from certain number of directions can be nullified at the antenna array using a second order processing technique called _ nested array _  @xcite . based on the concept of _ difference co - array _ , a nested array is implemented by nonuniform antenna placement .",
    "nested array achieves a degree of freedom ( dof ) of @xmath0 with only @xmath1 antennas .",
    "further , the direction of arrival estimation is performed with a _ passive sensing _ pattern , i.e. , the antenna array does not need to send out signals for detection .",
    "due to the benefits of passive sensing , easy implementation , and large number of dof , we apply nested array to interference management in massive mimo hetnets . with the nested array configuration at each sbs , the directions of @xmath0 users can be estimated .",
    "then , the interference from different directions can be filtered , so that the desired signal remains while interference signals are nullified .",
    "given the dof of each sbs , a key design problem is to select the set of interfering users that use the dof for interference nulling .",
    "we formulate such a problem as an integer programming problem with the objective of maximizing the sum rate of a massive mimo hetnet . since the objective function is nonlinear and nonconvex",
    ", we propose a series of approximations that transform the original problem into an integer programming problem with a linear objective function .",
    "the optimal solution of such a problem can be obtained with a _ cutting plane _ approach . moreover",
    ", we find that if an additional condition is satisfied by the system , the constraint matrix is _ unimodular _ and the integer problem is equivalent to an linear programming ( lp ) problem obtained by relaxing the integer constraints .",
    "thus an optimal solution can be obtained with an lp solver . to evaluate the performance of the solution obtained by the approximation",
    ", we derive a performance upper bound for comparison purpose .",
    "the proposed scheme is evaluated with simulations and compared with other benchmark schemes .",
    "the results show that near optimal performance can be achieved .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the nested array based interference nulling method is introduced in section  [ sec : nest ] . the system model and problem formulation are presented in section  [ sec : prob ] and the solution is presented in section  [ sec : sol ] .",

    "the corresponding source signal is @xmath30 and the noise vector is given as @xmath31 . analyzing the manifold matrix @xmath28",
    ", we find that the distinct rows of @xmath28 behave like the manifold of an array with antenna positions given by distinct values in the set @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the position vector of the original array .",
    "the new array is the difference co - array of the original array  @xcite .    in a difference",
    "co - array with antenna positions given in the set @xmath34 , it is easy to see that the number of elements in this set is @xmath35 .",
    "thus , given the original @xmath1-antenna array , the maximum dof of a difference co - array is @xmath36 we thus conclude that a dof of @xmath37 can be achieved with @xmath1 antennas by exploiting the second order statistics of the received signal  @xcite .",
    "this opens tremendous opportunities to detect more sources than the number of physical antenna elements .",
    "based on the difference co - array framework , the nested array was proposed in  @xcite as an effective solution to the problem of resolving more sources than antenna elements .",

    "according to the analysis in  , the difference co - array of a nested array has @xmath37 antenna elements , and thus a nested array achieves a dof of @xmath37 .",
    "compared to existing methods on increasing dof , the nested array approach is easy to implement with reduced overhead and can be applied to more general scenarios since less assumptions are needed for the system model .",
    "in addition , the nested array operates in a passive sensing pattern , which only needs to receive source signals .",
    "these favorable features make nested array suitable to applications in cellular networks .",

    "define the new beam pattern as @xmath46 thus , the powers of sources from different directions get spatially filtered by @xmath47 .",
    "it is then possible to adjust these new beam patterns so that the antenna array only receives desired signals , while nulling noise and interference signals .    for an sbs with nested",
    "array , suppose the directions of its sues are @xmath48 , and the directions of interfering sues and mues are @xmath49 . then , the beam patterns of different directions are expected to be @xmath50 according to the expression of @xmath27 in  , the beamforming weight vector should satisfy @xmath51    with the solution of @xmath39 , the weight vector of the original antenna array can be determined by the method presented in  @xcite .",
    "it can be observed from   that the dof to identify and manage the desired signals , noise , and interfering signals is @xmath37 .",
    "this enforces a constraint on the number of desired and interference sources that can be managed , and we will consider this in the problem formulation . the nested array based interference nulling approach provides a new perspective to interference management , by employing spatial filtering on different directions . with such desirable features of nested array , it is highly promising to apply this technique to interference management in massive mimo hetnets .",

    "then , the cutting plane method  @xcite can be employed to effectively obtain the optimal solution of the linear integer programming problem .",
    "consider the product of 0 - 1 variables , with all the variables having the same probability distribution .",
    "when the number of variables is increased , the product becomes less likely to be @xmath25 since it is less likely that all the variables are @xmath25 .",

    "<S> each base station ( bs ) can nullify a certain number of interference signals . </S>",
    "<S> a key design issue is to select the interference sources to be nullified at each bs . </S>",
    "<S> we formulate this problem as an integer programming problem . </S>",
    "<S> the objective is to maximize the sum rate of all users , subject to bs dof constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an approximation scheme to solve this problem and derive a performance upper bound . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively improves the sum rate and achieves a near optimal performance .    </S>",
