    "the db stars constitute the subgroup of helium - atmosphere white dwarfs whose optical spectrum is dominated by the transitions of neutral helium .",
    "their effective temperatures extend from roughly 13,000 k upward to @xmath7 .",
    "the lower boundary is imposed by the visibility of the he i lines , that become very weak and disappear near that effective temperature , while the upper boundary is the effective temperature near which the smooth merging occurs between the db sequence and the sequence of the hotter do stars , whose spectrum is characterized by lines of ionized helium . some filling - in of the region between 30,000 k and 40,000 k , previously thought to be devoid of helium - atmosphere white dwarfs @xcite and known as the `` db gap''@xcite , has been accomplished with the recent observation by @xcite of several fainter hot db stars in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "while the idea of a true gap in the cooling sequence of the helium - atmosphere white dwarfs has now been abandoned , @xcite argue nevertheless for the presence of a residual imbalance in the relative numbers of da and db stars , in the sense that the da / db number ratio is @xmath8 times larger at 30,000 k than it is at 20,000 k. this result is interpreted in terms of a transformation of @xmath9 % of the da stars observed at 30,000 k into db stars by the time these objects cool down to 20,000 k. if this were the case , the physical mechanism invoked by @xcite and @xcite within their global spectral evolution scheme for white dwarfs might still be relevant .",
    "it would require that a fraction of da white dwarfs be characterized by a hydrogen envelope that is thin enough ( of the order of @xmath10 ) for mixing to start between that envelope and the active , underlying helium convection zone .",
    "the photospheric composition would thereby revert to a helium - dominated one as the star proceeds along its cooling track .    before the numerous sdss discoveries , the northern db star pg 0112@xmath0104  had long held the status of the hottest db star .",
    "today , it merely appears cooler than most of the sdss stars .",
    "nevertheless , its discovery in the pg survey at a reasonable brightness ( @xmath11 ) makes it accessible to a variety of instruments , a substantial bonus for a hot db star . as such",
    ", it represent the best studied db white dwarf above 30,000 k. since it is not exactly understood how db stars above 30,000 k fit into white dwarf evolution , a comprehensive analysis of pg 0112@xmath0104  is crucial for an understanding of the still uncertain nature of the spectral evolution mechanism .",
    "pg 0112@xmath0104  is also the best object near the uncertain boundaries of the v777 her variable separating hot db star from db pulsators so an accurate determination of its atmospheric parameters is important for an unambiguous empirical location of the blue edge of the db instability strip .",
    "prompted by these considerations and by fuse observations secured by one of us ( tl ) , we endeavor here to reexamine pg 0112@xmath0104 . with the recent demise of fuse",
    ", this object is the last classical db star for which fuse data are available and unpublished .",
    "these data are combined here with additional , and largely unpublished , information available on this object in order to constrain effectively its atmospheric properties and to try to shed light on its nature .",
    "in addition , the status of pg 0112@xmath0104  as a non - variable star has recently been challenged @xcite so we take advantage of this study to reconsider the issue of the variability of this critical object .",
    "we present the observational material on which this investigation is based in   2 , and discuss some issues related to the modeling of db stars in   3 and 4 .",
    "our reanalysis follows in   5 , while our conclusions are presented in ",
    "the fuse detectors span the ultraviolet region between 905 and 1187  , a region where numerous transitions associated with heavy elements are located .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of pg 0112@xmath0104  were secured in ttag mode through the high - throughput lwrs aperture , which provides high - resolution ultraviolet spectra with @xmath12 15,000 .",
    "one set of exposures , 22.9 ks long , was secured on 2004 january 2 within go program c026 ( p.i .",
    ": tl ) , while a second , shorter series of exposures ( 4.25 ks ) was secured by jwk on 2004 december 19 within the fuse photometric calibration program m102 .",
    "table 1 summarizes these spectroscopic observations , together with those secured for this project with other instruments .",
    "data were reduced using the pipeline software calfuse ( version 3.2.1 ) . a detailed discussion of calfuse 3 is presented by @xcite .",
    "the individual exposures were coadded for segments a and b for the four channels ( sic1 , sic2 , lif1 and lif2 ) individually . to carry out this procedure",
    ", we use the publicly available program fuseregister written by @xcite together with scalar weights based on the exposure times .",
    "the eight weighted segments were then coadded with the use of a linear interpolation between the spectra in order to produce a final spectrum covering the whole fuse spectral range .",
    "figure 1 shows the whole fuse spectrum of pg 0112@xmath0104  that was obtained by merging the sic1b , lif1a , sic2b , lif2a , and lif1b segments . for the spectral analysis",
    ", we combine the segments that provide the best resolution after accounting for the small wavelength shifts between them . in all cases ,",
    "the noise level varies throughout the spectrum .",
    "this is due to the significant change in the effective area of the channels with wavelength , which results in variations in the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "in addition , the number of segments covering a given spectral region is a function of wavelength .",

    "high speed photometry was obtained by gf and s.  charpinet on 2002 july 14 ut with lapoune , the portable montral 3-channel photometer on the cfht 3.6  m reflector .",
    "the instrument uses three hamamatsu r647 - 04 photomultiplier tubes to measure simultaneously the target star , a reference star , and the sky . the light curve of slightly over an hour long ( 3650 s )",
    "was obtained under excellent photometric conditions , and consists of 365 points sampled every 10  s. our light curve is shown in figure 4 .",
    "our analysis is based on our updated grid of white dwarf models described in @xcite in which we have incorporated the improved stark profiles of neutral helium of @xcite . in the context of db stars , these models are comparable to those described by @xcite and @xcite , with the exception that at low temperatures ( @xmath29  k ) , we now use the free - free absorption coefficient of the negative helium ion of @xcite , but this should have no effect on the analysis of pg 0112@xmath0104  ( as discussed further below ) .",
    "our models are in lte and include convective energy transport within the mixing length theory . as in the analysis of @xcite , we use here the parameterization described as ml2/@xmath30 .",
    "synthetic spectra based on these models were used for the l@xmath1 and optical spectra analyses .",
    "in addition , several calculations were also carried out with tlusty and synspec , the publicly - available model atmosphere codes developed by i. hubeny and one of us ( tl ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , which were also used in the analysis of @xcite . specifically , we used these codes for the determination of the carbon abundance and to set the upper limits on other heavy elements ( see   5.5 below ) as well as to reassess the importance of nlte effects in db stars ( see   4 below ) .",
    "while the standard parameterization of the convective efficiency within the mixing length theory included in tlusty corresponds to that described by @xcite , we have modified our version to be able to consider alternative efficiencies .",
    "in their analysis of hst observations of helium - atmosphere white dwarfs , @xcite suggest that nlte effects in the continuum of db stars might be significant and deserve consideration in their analysis .",
    "their figure 3 shows , in particular , deviations at the level of 9 % near 1500  , and at the level of 4 % near 4000  , between emergent fluxes from a lte model and those of a nlte model , both computed with tlusty at @xmath31 .",
    "this comes a bit as a surprise since the early investigations of both @xcite and @xcite suggested that nlte effects in the continuum were negligible even at effective temperatures considerably higher than that of @xcite .",
    "@xcite also justified a lte analysis of the db stars on the basis of the complete absence of nlte effects in the he i line spectrum at @xmath32 ; nlte effects in the lines can persist even when continuum nlte effects are completely negligible ( a case in point would be the sharp h@xmath1 core in cool da stars ) . even more recently , in a reanalysis of hot sdss db white dwarfs in the db - gap , @xcite concluded that lte is a valid assumption for objects with effective temperature below 45,000 k. the result of @xcite and @xcite thus appear to confirm the earlier assessment that nlte effects are negligible for the analysis of db stars .",
    "intrigued by the @xcite claim , which is based on tlusty models , we have computed our own nlte models of db stars with tlusty .",
    "the input parameters are identical to those of @xcite , namely @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and the parameterization of @xcite for the convective flux within the mixing - length theory .",
    "we find no observable nlte effects in the ultraviolet and optical continua at that effective temperature .",
    "furthermore , additional tests suggest that no nlte effects are apparent in the optical he i line spectrum at 40,000 k and 30,000 k , the highest temperature we considered .",
    "this is in complete agreement with the result of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however we find nlte effects within @xmath36   of the core of the l@xmath1 line , which is formed high in the photosphere .",
    "we have explicitly checked that these effects have no significant impact upon the analysis we carry out , given that the saturated interstellar profile at @xmath37 dominates the core of the observed l@xmath1 profile .",
    "we also explicitely verified that the models calculated with small traces of carbon are identical to those without carbon . the abundance of carbon needs to be several orders of magnitude higher , which is ruled out by spectroscopic observations , to have any detectable effect on the thermodynamic structure . therefore , classical lte db atmosphere models are sufficient for determining the effective temperature and the surface gravity of pg 0112@xmath0104  from the optical spectra .",
    "the analyses of @xcite and @xcite show that the effective temperature determined from the optical spectrum of hot db stars depends on the hydrogen abundance adopted for the atmosphere , despite the fact that hydrogen may not be directly visible .",
    "this is why two effective temperatures , which differ by 200@xmath194000 k , are listed by @xcite for the majority of db stars : the hotter one was obtained under the assumption of a completely hydrogen - free atmosphere , and the cooler one was obtained under the assumption that hydrogen is present at an abundance slightly below that at which the h@xmath38 line would become visible . in general , thus , the fits to the he i lines in the optical provide a locus of optimal effective temperatures as a function of assumed hydrogen abundance .",
    "the constraints that can be placed on the photospheric hydrogen abundance thus represent important ingredients in the analysis of hot db stars .",
    "these can be obtained by searching either the h@xmath1 transition in the red or the l@xmath1 transition in the ultraviolet .",
    "both techniques have well - known advantages and disadvantages . in rare cases , for example for bright or important objects ,",
    "both sets of data are available .",
    "this is the case for pg 0112@xmath0104 .",
    "the fits to the older blue optical spectrum of pg 0112@xmath0104  by @xcite yielded @xmath39 k , @xmath40 for a pure helium composition , and @xmath41 k , @xmath42 for a composition with @xmath43 .",
    "this representative abundance was chosen at the time on the basis of a quick look at the newly - acquired ghrs data which appeared to show a fairly strong l@xmath1 profile .",
    "of course , the profile has since been shown by @xcite to have a substantial interstellar contribution , and their derived photospheric hydrogen abundance , namely @xmath44 , is consequently somewhat lower than the nominal value used by @xcite .    as an internal check of our updated model grid discussed in   3 , we analyzed this older spectrum using our fitting technique that relies on the nonlinear least - squares method of levenberg - marquardt @xcite , which is based on a steepest descent method .",
    "the model spectra ( convolved with a gaussian instrumental profile ) and the optical spectrum are first normalized to a continuum set to unity ; this continuum is set in a similar fashion to that described in detail in @xcite for da stars .",
    "the calculation of @xmath45 is then carried out in terms of these normalized line profiles only . atmospheric parameters ",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath47  are considered free parameters in the fitting procedure ; in the case of pg 0112@xmath0104  we assume a given value of the hydrogen abundance and compare the predicted h@xmath1 profile with the observations to set a limit on the hydrogen abundance ( see below ) . our atmospheric parameters with this old spectrum yields @xmath48  k and @xmath49 under the assumption of a pure helium composition , in excellent agreement with the values reported by @xcite , which suggests that both model grids for db stars are entirely consistent .",
    "since the analysis of @xcite , a new blue spectrum as well as spectra covering h@xmath1 have been secured .",
    "our analysis of this blue spectrum using our pure helium grid yields @xmath50  k and @xmath51 , in almost perfect agreement with the results obtained with our old spectrum .",
    "our procedure is then to fit this spectrum assuming various hydrogen abundances and compare the predictions at h@xmath1 with our red spectrum .",
    "these comparisons are shown in the insert of figure [ fg : f3 ] for @xmath52 ( 31,320  k , 7.82 ; this is almost identical to our pure helium solution ) , @xmath53 ( 30,780  k , 7.81 ) , and @xmath54 ( 29,140  k , 7.78 ) .",
    "since h@xmath1 is clearly not detected in our red spectrum , we adopt as our final solution @xmath55  k , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , a hydrogen abundance limit that not is grossly inconsistent with the result of @xcite based exclusively on the l@xmath1 profile .",
    "our adopted solution is superposed in figure [ fg : f3 ] on top of the the blue and red spectra .",
    "when l@xmath1 observations are available , the contribution of both the geocoronal feature and the interstellar medium absorption must be allowed for . as shown by @xcite and @xcite in their pioneering analyses of the l@xmath1 profile in pg 0112@xmath0104 , gd 190 , and in the prototypical v777 her star gd 358 ,",
    "this can be done successfully when the saturated core and the broad wings are considered separately . for nearby objects ,",
    "this allows limits on the photospheric hydrogen content to be placed .",
    "the values of the atmospheric parameters we have secured on the basis of the optical data in the preceding section are likely to be the most reliable in terms of the assumptions underlying our analysis .",
    "nevertheless , other spectral ranges , perhaps less amenable to detailed analyses , can contribute to the overall self - consistency of the analysis . in this spirit",
    ", we have investigated the consistency of the l@xmath1 profile , following the method and technique outline by @xcite in their original analysis , with our optical determination of the atmospheric parameters of pg 0112@xmath0104 .",
    "the saturated part of the profile suggests a fairly well constrained interstellar hydrogen column density of @xmath58 , a value consistent with the results of the initial analysis .",
    "the resulting photospheric hydrogen abundance depends on the assumed effective temperature , and  given the importance assumed by the interstellar core  a two - dimensional fit would likely not be significant .",
    "we plot , in figure 5 , the match to the overall ism@xmath0photospheric l@xmath1 profile secured with models at our optically determined effective temperature and gravity .",
    "this is done for values of the hydrogen abundance of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "the two panels display matches secured with values bracketing the optimal column density determined above .",
    "the theoretical profiles become less sensitive to the hydrogen abundance for @xmath5 , and an accurate determination of the hydrogen content from the l@xmath1 profile seems hardly possible .",
    "suffice it to be said that the value we derive from the optical spectrum is consistent with the limit set from the hst data .",
    "our fos data show several members of the far - ultraviolet series originating on the @xmath62 lower level at @xmath63 .",
    "prominent among those are the first members at 3187.74   ( @xmath64 ) , 2945.10   ( @xmath65 ) , and 2829.07   ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "these transitions can been seen faintly in some of the better exposed iue lwr spectra of db white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "as was done with the l@xmath1 profile , we can investigate here the rough consistency of our atmospheric parameters with those new features , amenable to a preliminary analysis . in figure 6",
    ", we plot the observed fos data together with a synthetic spectrum generated with synspec at the values of the atmospheric parameters determined above .",
    "while the match to the first two transitions appears quite good , it worsens as we move up the series .",
    "this is undoubtedly due to a combination of factors , namely the lack of tabulated electron impact widths for the higher line members and the omission , within synspec , of detailed treatment of the level dissolution as we approach the series limit near 2644  .",
    "the s / n ratio of the medium - resolution ghrs data around the @xmath67 transition is unfortunately too low to provide a useful check on the atmospheric parameters of pg 0112@xmath0104 .",
    "our synthetic spectra do predict a weak @xmath67 transition at this effective temperature , but no meaningful confrontation with the data is possible .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of the star provides an additional piece of information .",
    "while its slope is , for classical hot db stars , relatively insensitive to the photospheric hydrogen content and to the surface gravity , it displays some sensitivity to the effective temperature , especially when the energy distribution can be sampled as far as possible in the ultraviolet .",
    "while issues related to interstellar reddening and calibration must then be addressed , the matching of the energy distribution of pg 0112@xmath0104  affords us with another consistency check on the adopted values of @xmath46 and @xmath68 which can not be overlooked .",
    "figure 7 displays the energy distribution we have constructed for pg 0112@xmath0104 .",
    "it includes the fuse data , sampled in 20 - wide bins , the hst and ghrs data , sampled in 40 - wide bins , as well as the multichannel data , converted to monochromatic flux according to the relation of @xcite .",
    "the match at @xmath69 ) defines the solid angle for all the data .",
    "there are , for this object , two modern sets of magnitudes available .",
    "the first one , by @xcite , includes the multichannel @xmath70 magnitude ( @xmath71 ) together with five mcsp color indices from which six monochromatic magnitudes can be extracted .",
    "the second data set , provided by @xcite , lists a full set of 15 monochromatic magnitudes , all simply read off ccd spectrophotometric data .",
    "the visual magnitude obtained in that last effort , @xmath72 , is a full 0.15 mag fainter than that provided by @xcite . on the basis of our experience with these data ,",
    "we restrict our analysis here to the full mcsp data of 1984 , which is given on the ab79 calibration scale of @xcite .",
    "our procedure includes a provision for the contribution of interstellar reddening , as described by the analytic expression for interstellar extinction of @xcite .",
    "overall , the @xcite data leads to a reasonable fit to the energy distribution in the long - wavelength ultraviolet range .",
    "the fuse data , on the other hand , are below the predicted model fluxes .",
    "an improved match can be secured by including modest amounts of reddening @xmath73 .",
    "this value is consistent with the low column density of neutral hydrogen determined earlier on the basis of the l@xmath1 profile , namely @xmath58 , as well as with the apparent absence of @xmath74 absorption in the fuse spectra .",

    "the two components of the doublet , @xmath1551036.337 and @xmath1551037.018 , are split since the doublet originates on levels of low excitation energy ( ground - state for the blue component , and 63.4 cm@xmath21 above the ground state for the red component ) .",
    "both doublet components thus exhibit well - separated contributions originating in the photosphere and in the ism . for the other carbon features observed , the energy of the lower levels is high enough to guarantee a photospheric origin .",
    "table 2 lists the transitions uncovered and equivalent widths measured in the fuse spectra of pg 0112@xmath0104 . among the db stars previously studied with fuse , ec 20058@xmath195234  with its effective temperature near 28,000 k  is the closest analog to pg 0112@xmath0104 : in that object , @xcite reported the @xmath1551010 and @xmath1551036 doublets , as well as the @xmath1551175 complex . the @xmath1551066 doublet was not observed .",

    ", we analyzed the night - time data of the sic channels in order to avoid the scattered solar emission contribution .",
    "for each transition , the individual uncertainty on the carbon abundance ranges from @xmath157 dex to @xmath158 dex .",
    "the uncertainties on the carbon abundances take into account uncertainties on the quality of the fit , uncertainties on the oscillator strengths , and uncertainties on the atmospheric parameters ( @xmath159  k , @xmath160 dex , and @xmath161 dex ) .",
    "table 2 shows that the carbon abundances vary from @xmath162 to @xmath163 .",
    "these two extremes come from the two @xmath155977 and @xmath1641175 lines . considering all carbon abundances",

    ", we were able to estimate abundance upper limits of a dozen elements .",
    "table 3 summarizes our results and shows the lines that we used for determining the upper limits .",
    "the upper limits correspond to abundances that are 3@xmath168 above the lowest detectable abundances .",

    "elements such as oxygen and calcium do not have strong lines in the _ fuse _ pass band for a star like pg  0112 + 104 , so no upper limits could be set for these elements .",
    "the problem posed by the presence of carbon in hot , classical db stars such as gd 358 , ec 20058@xmath195234 or pg 0112@xmath0104  was addressed by @xcite , who used the carbon abundance value published by @xcite ( @xmath171 ) in their discussion .",
    "our updating of the carbon abundance in pg 0112@xmath0104  does little to alleviate the problems discussed there and in @xcite : `` hot '' db stars are too cool for significant radiative element support , but too hot for significant dredge - up or accretion from the ism .",
    "@xcite have proposed an attractive scenario to account for the presence of carbon in db stars above 23,000 k. in their view , the observed carbon abundances result from the competition in hot db stars of efficient downward gravitational settling with a weak stellar wind left over from previous evolution . while there is currently no direct evidence for this wind ,",
    "its existence is not unreasonable given that signs of mass loss are observed in the pg 1159 progenitors of hot db stars .",
    "the investigation of winds along the cooling track performed by @xcite is based on fully evolutionary models which include a linear relationship between mass loss and age , with the wind turning off completely by the time a star reaches @xmath172 k. for the hot db stars , the resulting carbon abundance depends , in the main , on the mass loss rate and is not strongly dependent on the structural parameters of the star ( for example , on the helium layer thickness ) . to account for the abundances summarized by @xcite , the rates invoked are of the order of a few @xmath173 m@xmath174 yr@xmath21 .",
    "large amounts of carbon are also found in the so - called hot dq white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "these carbon - dominated atmosphere white dwarfs are believed to be the offsprings of db white dwarfs with very thin helium layers that have experienced a convective mixing episode with the underlying carbon envelope .",
    "however , the hot dq stars are all found at a much lower effective temperatures ( @xmath175  k ) than pg 0112@xmath0104 .",
    "it thus appears very unlikely that the carbon observed in the atmosphere of this hot db white dwarf could be the result of a similar convective transformation caught in its early phase .",

    "were reported .",
    "thus @xcite list maximum semi - amplitudes of 0.30 % in the 10  s@xmath19 50  s window , of 0.21 % in the 50  s@xmath19 200  s window , and of 0.29 % in the 200  s@xmath19 1200  s window , while @xcite report upper limits on the amplitude of brightness variations of 0.34 % , the later being based on uv data where the amplitudes are expected to be even larger than in the optical .    more recently , however , @xcite and @xcite have reopened the debate and suggested , on the basis of 30 h of observing carried out in 2001 october at the mcdonald observatory 2.1-m telescope , that the object might be variable , with two periods tentatively identified : @xmath202 , with an amplitude of 0.083 % ; and @xmath203 , with an amplitude of 0.087 % .",
    "the noise level in the fourier amplitude spectrum is @xmath204 0.018 % .",
    "the periods they infer are consistent with those that characterize known v777 her stars ( @xmath205 s ) , but the reported amplitudes are considerably lower than those observed up to now even in the lowest - amplitude v777 her pulsators , which are @xmath204 4.6 % ( for pg 1351@xmath0489 and pg 2246@xmath0121 ) .    if the pulsations observed by @xcite in pg 0112@xmath0104  are real , it is unclear to what extent the driving mechanism  and its associated instability strip  invoked for the regular v777 her stars may be relevant to the variations they observed . while the @xcite and @xcite data were considered preliminary , their potentially crucial importance within the context of pulsation theory prompted us to observe pg 0112@xmath0104  as a backup object during one of our high - speed photometry run at the cfht .",
    "as shown in figure 9 , white light brightness variations with amplitudes greater than 0.08 % of the mean brightness of the star can be ruled out in the period window from 20 s to 1800 s , a range that includes all known periodicities in dbv variables . with a noise level of the order of twice that of @xcite , we see no structure at the frequency ( 5.06  mhz ) corresponding to the 198  s period , while a noise peak might be present at the frequency ( 5.92  mhz ) corresponding to the 169  s period detected by @xcite .",
    "our upper limits on the brightness variations in pg 0112@xmath0104  are comparable to ( even slightly lower than ) the variations reported by @xcite , so we can not confirm their suggested detection .",
    "we note in this context that had pg 0112@xmath0104  been a normal v777 her variable , our observations would have revealed it easily .    what is , then , the status of the variations observed by @xcite ?",
    "to our knowledge , neither was their preliminary report published in a refereed journal nor was their claim withdrawn .",
    "it is assuredly of some significance that pg 0112@xmath0104  was not considered a v777 her star in the recent review of @xcite .",
    "even more recently , the discussion of the instability strip of the db stars of @xcite includes a private communication from j. provencal stating that `` time series observations of this star [ pg 0112@xmath0104 ] have not detected any pulsations '' .",
    "this revised position is in agreement with our own result , and suggests that pg 0112@xmath0104  truly sits above the blue edge of the v777 her instability strip .",
    "we have provided a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of the hot db white dwarf pg 0112@xmath0104  based on data largely unexploited up to now .",
    "our analysis yields the following parameters : @xmath206 k , log @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , a hydrogen abundance of @xmath5 , and an improved carbon abundance of @xmath207 .",
    "since the discovery of several hot db stars within the sdss has contributed to the demise of the idea of a true db gap along the white dwarf cooling sequence , the individual modeling of a single `` hot '' db white dwarf may have lost some of its luster .",
    "nevertheless , at @xmath208 , pg 0112@xmath0104  remains one of the few hot db stars currently amenable to a detailed analysis of the type completed here .",
    "pg 0112@xmath0104  represents our best object near the transition from nonpulsator to pulsator and our reevaluation of the status of pg 0112@xmath0104  as a v777 her star in   5.6 underscores the fact that , even for the brightest members , a complete picture of these complex objects is only slowly developing .",
    "there are still many aspects about the evolution of helium atmosphere white dwarf that are not completely understood yet , for instance the observed carbon and hydrogen abundance patterns and the exact location of the instability strip .",
