    "benford s law is an empirical law , based on the observation that the first significant digits , in a given set of data are not random . instead , the chance that the first significant digit from the set of data happens to be `` 1 '' is almost @xmath0% , `` 2 '' almost 17% , and so on .",
    "the frequency of the digit `` 9 '' is the lowest among all the digits from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , and it is around @xmath3% .",
    "the law was first observed by the astronomer simon newcomb in 1881  @xcite , who also proposed the probability function to the distribution .",
    "it is this distribution which is today known as the `` benford s law '' or `` the law of first digit '' or `` the leading digit phenomenon '' .",
    "this law was rediscovered by frank benford in 1938  @xcite .",
    "benford s law predicts the frequency distribution of the first significant digit @xmath4 as @xmath5 the law has since been verified for a wide spectrum of situations in natural science , and while studying mathematical series  @xcite .",
    "not all sets of numbers obey this law , e.g. random numbers obtained from a computer code will not obey such a law , and the frequency of any number from @xmath1 to @xmath2 as a leading digit will be @xmath6 .",
    "but there are examples ranging from data obtained in earthquakes , and the brightness of gamma rays that reaches earth , to the rotation rates of spinning stars , where benford s law is respected  @xcite .",
    "violations of the law have been used in detecting cases of tax fraud , election fraud , digital image manipulation , faint earthquakes , and phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "the scale invariance of benford law also makes it independent of the measuring device used to get the source data  @xcite . a quantum phase transition ( qpt )",
    "is a change in the phase of a system at zero temperature , driven by some parameter of the system , like external magnetic field or the coupling strength between particles .",
    "unlike the thermal phase transitions  @xcite where the transition arises due to thermal fluctuations in the system , quantum phase transitions are driven solely by quantum fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "understanding quantum phases in many - body quantum systems is important for a number of reasons , including discerning quantumness in systems of several particles and realizing quantum computers .",
    "the one - dimensional transverse xy model is an integrable model where a quantum phase transition occurs at zero temperature when the external transverse field is varied  @xcite .",
    "this model has been studied , e.g. in crystals of conb@xmath7o@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "spectacular advances in cold gas experimental techniques in recent years have led to the possibility of experimental detection of such transitions in optical lattice systems and ion traps  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the anisotropic quantum xy models , in one dimension , for finite- and infinite - size systems .",
    "the system undergoes a quantum phase transition at @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the strength of the external magnetic field while @xmath11 is the coupling strength between neighboring spins .",
    "here we use the benford s law to detect the transition and investigate its scaling properties .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is its amenability to experiments , owing to the fact that one requires to investigate only the first significant digit of an observable , which can be easily measured in experiments .",
    "we study the transverse magnetization as a function of the external magnetic field .",
    "the difference between the frequency distributions of the first significant digits of the transverse magnetization and the expected frequency distribution from benford s law , is quantified using a parameter called the benford violation parameter  ( bvp ) .",
    "the maxima of the derivative of the bvp with respect to the magnetic field , indicates the point of the quantum phase transition ( @xmath12 ) , in finite size systems .",
    "finite size scaling analysis shows that the phase transition point for finite systems ( @xmath12 ) approaches the critical point for infinite systems ( @xmath13 ) as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 can be as high as -2.45 , and @xmath16 is the number of spins .",
    "we further extend this analysis to the infinite - size quantum xy model , but at non - zero temperature .",
    "the bvp shows two crossovers in the @xmath17 plane , as the magnetic field is varied across the critical point , where @xmath18 is a scaled temperature .",
    "the finite temperature quantum critical region , for unit anisotropy , is contained within the lines @xmath19 , for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , for @xmath22 . besides , we find that the benford distribution is not the only distribution which can be used to detect the quantum phase transition .",
    "we show that other discrete distributions like the uniform and the poisson ( for a number of values of its parameter ) can signal the qpt .",
    "we find the scaling exponents of the quantum critical point by using the uniform and the poisson distributions .",
    "we also analyze the effect of changing the distance measure between the observed and predicted probability distributions on the scaling exponents .",

    "we now discuss the methodology employed to analyze the data obtained for a given observable by using the benford violation parameter .",
    "the idea of the benford violation parameter is to characterize an observable in terms of the frequencies of the first significant digits . to do this ,",

    "we have used a number of other discrete frequency distributions along with three different measures to discriminate between frequency distributions .",
    "it is seen that the benford distribution is not unique and that other distributions can also be employed to analyze data and detect a quantum critical point in the quantum xy models .",
    "however , analysis of data using the benford distribution produces higher scaling exponents in almost all cases .",
    "this indicates that this is possibly a better tool for data analysis . in this paper , we have compared pairs of frequency distributions , one of which is obtained from quantum theory and the other is obtained from a probability distribution . the distance between the two distributions is quantified by a number obtained by using a measure .",
    "the choice of this measure is not unique .",
    "we have reported our results by using the mean deviation , standard deviation , and the bhattacharya metric to quantify the distance between the two frequency distributions .",
    "the analysis has been carried out for both finite and infinite size systems for different observables at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "interestingly , most of the finite size scaling exponents obtained in this paper by using the violation parameters are much higher than those obtained using other measures like magnetization , fidelity , concurrence , shared purity , and quantum discord .",
    "we also find the linear relationship between temperature and the driving parameter at a finite temperature , along the cross - over lines , in this model .",
    "the analysis strongly suggests that measuring the benford violation parameter in the laboratory can be an efficient tool for detecting phase transitions in quantum many - body systems .",

    "<S> we extend our analysis to the same system but at finite temperature and find that it also detects the finite temperature phase transition in the model . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we compare the benford distribution analysis with the same obtained from the uniform and poisson distributions . </S>",
