    "the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) is one of the most widely used techniques in modern molecular biology .",

    "evolution @xcite , to molecular computers @xcite . in spite of its ubiquity in biology , theoretical discussions of pcr",
    "although kinetic models of the enzyme - mediated polymerization of single - stranded dna have been reported @xcite , none of them were applied to model pcr , and only recently a treatment of the rate of mutations arising in pcr has been considered @xcite .",
    "the main object of our study is the probability that one molecule will be replicated in one pcr cycle , the so - called efficiency @xmath0 . in section",
    "ii we present a detailed kinetic model of the polymerization and find @xmath0 as a function of the physical parameters of the problem .",
    "this allows us to discuss the range of validity of the assumption of constant probability of replication , on which statistical considerations have been based @xcite . within that range ,",
    "we apply the theory of branching processes in section iii , to show the existence of new phenomena : the probability density function ( pdf ) of the number of molecules after a given number of cycles of pcr displays scaling behavior , and under some conditions , this pdf is multi - modal . in section iv a novel method for quantitative pcr is presented , based on the statistical considerations of the previous sections . in section",
    "v we summarize our work .    one cycle of pcr consists of three steps .",
    "( for a more detailed account of the pcr technique see , e.g. , @xcite . ) in the _ denaturing _ step , the two strands of the parent dna molecule in solution are separated into single - stranded ( ss ) templates by rising the temperature to about @xmath1 to disrupt the hydrogen bonds . in the _ annealing _ step ,",
    "the solution is cooled down to approximately @xmath2 to allow the _ primers _ , present in a high concentration , to hybridize with the ss dna .",
    "the primers are two ( different ) 20 to 30 nucleotides long molecules which are watson - crick complementary to the 3 flanking extreme of the templates",
    ". once the primer - template heteroduplex is formed , it acts as the _ initiation complex _ for the _ dna - polymerase _ to recognize and bind to .",
    "this step is crucial for the specificity of the amplification : only those molecules that have sequences complementary to the primers will be amplified .",
    "the last step is a polymerization reaction , in which the solution is heated to @xmath3 , the optimal working temperature for _ thermus aquaticus _ dna polymerase .",
    "this enzyme catalyzes the binding of complementary nucleotides to the template , in the direction that goes from the primer to the other extreme molecule , and the polymerase can only attach new nucleotides to the 3 end of the molecule that is being extended . ] .",
    "notice that if this polymerization proceeded to its end , at the end of the third step we would have twice as many dna molecules as we had at the beginning of step 1 .",
    "these three steps constitute one cycle of the pcr , which is usually 30 seconds to 2 minutes long .",
    "the cycles are repeated a number of times ( typically 30 ) by varying the temperature in the solution , in such a way that the dna molecules that were synthesized in a given cycle are used as templates in the following one . in this way one gets an extremely efficient amplification mechanism for dna .",
    "we will represent the last two steps of a typical cycle of pcr by means of a kinetic model .",
    "our species will be the primers ( @xmath4 , of length @xmath5 nucleotides ) , the ss dna ( @xmath6 , consisting of @xmath7 nucleotides ) , the heteroduplexes ( @xmath8 , formed by one complete @xmath6 and the partially assembled complementary strand consisting of the primer and the next @xmath9 nucleotides ) , the nucleotides ( @xmath10 , which will be considered identical ) , the polymerase ( @xmath11 ) and the heteroduplexes @xmath8 with the polymerase attached to them ( @xmath12 ) .",

    ", one should assign a given duration to step 2 and another to step 3 . for the sake of simplicity , however , we shall consider both step 2 and step 3 as running simultaneously in the simulations to be presented below .",
    "this is a mild simplification which does not alter the conclusions to be drawn .",
    "the definition of the efficiency @xmath0 implies that it is simply the ratio between the number of @xmath6 molecules that were completely replicated at the end of a given cycle and the initial number of @xmath6 molecules in that cycle : p(t ) = [ p ] figure 1 shows plots of the probability of replication @xmath0 as a function of time @xmath16 ( which is to be interpreted as the duration of step 3 in a typical pcr cycle ) , for different polymerization lengths @xmath17 . since to the best of our knowledge",

    "however , it can be shown that this procedure always yields two possible solutions for @xmath0 and @xmath86 , and there is no possible way _ a priori _ , of choosing the right one .",
    "the reason for this is that for @xmath86 bigger than a few hundreds ( which is nonetheless a small number of molecules ) , the distribution of @xmath84 is gaussian , and therefore determined only by the mean and the variance , which give the above mentioned ambiguous answer .",
    "consider instead the following scheme .",
    "we prepare two sets of samples @xmath151 and @xmath152 , each with @xmath153 identical preparations and whose initial concentration of a given double - stranded dna molecule is unknown .",
    "we run ( under conditions for which @xmath0 can be considered approximately constant from cycle to cycle ) @xmath154 cycles of pcr on set @xmath151 , and @xmath155 cycles on set @xmath152 , after which we measure the number of molecules in every sample .",
    "the averages @xmath156 and @xmath157 over the @xmath153 preparations in @xmath151 and @xmath152 , are estimates of the ensemble averages @xmath158 and @xmath159 corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ mean ] ) for @xmath160 and @xmath161 respectively .",
    "we can use that formula to compute @xmath162 as an estimate of the real @xmath86 and @xmath163 as an estimate of the real @xmath0 .",
    "of course these estimates make sense only if a measure of the error involved in the method is provided .",
    "it takes a simple calculation to show that , m_0 m_0 ; p [ mean_estimate ] , and _ m_0 & & , [ sd_1 ] + _ & & .[sd_2 ] in writing the last two equations we used eq .",
    "( [ variance ] ) .",
    "we tested these expressions in a set of very simple numerical simulations , whose details we are not going to report here except for saying that the pcr amplification was represented by the cascade given by eq .",
    "( [ recursion ] ) . under variations of all the parameters involved , eq .",
    "( [ mean_estimate])-([sd_2 ] ) were in excellent agreement with the numerical results . to get a flavor of the precision of the method proposed , assume a simple example with @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "under these conditions the above equations predict that the estimate of @xmath86 will be correct within @xmath169 ( that is @xmath170 molecules ) and that of @xmath0 will be correct within @xmath171!. these estimates refer to the purely statistical errors , and they will be fairly small under typical conditions . in real experiments they have to be supplemented with the errors involved in the measurement of the concentrations . if @xmath86 and @xmath0 fluctuated from sample to sample ( due to inevitable differences in their preparations ) , the fact that we are averaging over @xmath153 samples will screen these fluctuations . in this latter case ,",
    "( [ mean_estimate ] ) will still be in agreement with the average @xmath86 and @xmath0 , and eqs .",
    "( [ sd_1 ] ) and ( [ sd_2 ] ) , which can be easily generalized to include these fluctuations , will give their right order of magnitude .",
    "we have presented a kinetic model for the pcr , which can be the basis for a more accurate application of quantitative techniques , as it provides a dynamical account of the probability of replication as a function of the physical parameters involved .",
    "these include the rate constants of the different reactions .",
    "conversely , the model allows us to extract information on these rates from direct measurements of @xmath0 . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", it can also be used in the description of _ in vivo _ and _ in vitro _",
    "enzymatic polymerization processes @xcite .",
    "the statistical analysis of pcr under the assumption of constant replication probability shows new interesting phenomena .",
    "the scaling behavior of the pdf is an effect of the recursivity of the process , whereas the multi - modality is related to failures in replication during the first cycles .",
    "although the latter is a phenomenon present only for a small number of initial molecules , it is not far from actual experimental conditions , and might be of relevance in quantitative applications .",
