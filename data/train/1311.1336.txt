    "within the study of superconductivity , the possibility that liquid vortex excitations survive above @xmath5 , leading to local superconductivity , remains a key open problem , despite the variety of experimental and theoretical efforts.@xcite among all the experimental tools , the measure of the magnetization@xcite is the most straightforward , as it gives a clear diamagnetic response @xmath6 , as soon as the cooper pairs are formed , provided to subtract possible paramagnetic contributions , occurring at a temperature above the onset of the fluctuations . in this regard , the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory predicts , for evanescent fields @xmath7 , a diamagnetic magnetization linear in @xmath7 for @xmath8 , and accordingly a susceptibility @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the reduced temperature and @xmath11 is the system dimensionality . for a finite magnetic field and temperatures @xmath12 , the diamagnetic part of the magnetization diverges as @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite + in addition , a relevant feature of superconducting fluctuations ( sf ) is the presence of an upturn field @xmath15 in the isothermal curves of the fluctuating magnetization @xmath16 .",

    ", very high magnetic fields must quench the superconducting fluctuations .",
    "the combination of the two effects leads the isothermal magnetization curves to exhibit an upturn @xmath15 , the value of which is , for layered superconductors in the framework of the gl phenomenology , of the order of @xmath19.@xcite therefore in optimally doped high-@xmath5 superconductors , and iron - pnictides , the upturn could be possibly detected only at very strong fields ( @xmath20 t ) , even for temperatures close enough to @xmath5.@xcite    these fluctuations have been detected in several compounds , as in and pb,@xcite metallic nanoparticles,@xcite mgb@xmath2,@xcite as well as optimally doped high-@xmath5 cuprates.@xcite in fact the high-@xmath5 superconductors are ideal materials to study the sf , owing to their small coherence length @xmath21 , the reduced carrier density @xmath22 , the strong anisotropy @xmath23 , and high transition temperature .    on the contrary ,",
    "underdoped and overdoped cuprates show dramatic deviations from the previous behavior , namely ( i ) the upturn field is not ascribable to gl theory ; ( ii ) in correspondence with the upturn in @xmath18 , the susceptibility @xmath24 for @xmath25 is anomalously large;@xcite and ( iii ) magnetic irreversibility is often found .",
    "a remarkable example of this phenomenology is given by yba@xmath2cu@xmath26o@xmath27.@xcite    the early interpretative attempts were due to sewer and beck@xcite who described this phenomenology in terms of phase instabilities due to the formation of a vortex liquid , which can be either thermally excited , or induced by the magnetic field .",
    "later on , following this inspiring idea , and by taking into account terms in the free energy functional initially neglected , the model was extended,@xcite and the upturn in @xmath18 at low field was justified from a phenomenological point of view .",
    "the latter model assumes the occurrence , above @xmath5 , of mesoscopic islands where @xmath28 , but with strong phase fluctuations which inhibit the long - range coherence.@xcite this theory successfully described the behavior of several materials,@xcite and it is in agreement with scanning squid microscopy results,@xcite as well as nernst effect,@xcite and arpes.@xcite    after 2008 , much attention was devoted to the iron - based superconductors .",
    "among all the families , the 122 is one of the most promising for applications , as it is characterized by reduced thermal fluctuations , owing to a small ginzburg number , @xmath29.@xcite nevertheless a few studies concerning superconducting fluctuations have been performed , one of the most noticeable being a study on a 1111 compound@xcite that showed the presence of phase fluctuations , manifested in a very similar way to cuprate superconductors .",

    "<S> we measured the static uniform spin susceptibility of ba(fe@xmath0rh@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 iron - based superconductors , over a broad range of doping ( @xmath3 ) and magnetic fields . at small fields ( @xmath4 1 koe ) </S>",
    "<S> we observed , above the transition temperature @xmath5 , the occurrence of precursor diamagnetism , which is not ascribable to the ginzburg - landau theory . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> our data fit a phase fluctuation model , which has been used to interpret a similar phenomenology occurring in the high-@xmath5 cuprate superconductors . on the other hand , in presence of strong fields the unconventional fluctuating diamagnetism </S>",
    "<S> is suppressed , whereas 3d fluctuations are found , in agreement with literature . </S>"
