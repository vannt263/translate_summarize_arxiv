    "one central goal of extragalactic research is to understand what factors drive the morphology of galaxies and how important these factors are over long term evolution .",
    "our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution is still largely dominated by the early scenarios of dissipative monolithic collapse ( eggen , lynden - bell @xmath4 sandage 1962 ) , and the hierarchical clustering of galaxies ( toomre @xmath4 toomre 1972 ; toomre 1977 ; navarro @xmath4 steinmetz 2000 ) .",
    "for instance , the bulges in disk galaxies are assumed to have formed either in a single episode of gravitational collapse , or more gradually , via mergers of disk galaxies in the distant past .",
    "this results in a classical velocity supported bulge .",
    "hierarchical clustering of the universe , dominated by cold dark matter , seems to account remarkably well for the large scale structure of galaxies , but it is faced with problems while trying to explain the structural components of individual galaxies .",
    "for example , galaxies are not found to have cuspy halos ( see bosma 2003 ) , nor is the observed amount of mass in the bulge component as large as predicted by these models . the discovery that a large majority of the bulges in late - type spiral galaxies are actually pseudobulges formed by secular evolutionary processes has also been difficult to explain in the hierarchical picture of galaxy formation ( see the review by kormendy @xmath4 kennicutt 2004 ; hereafter kk2004 ) .",
    "the monolithic collapse scenario of galaxy formation is also faced with problems when compared with the recent cosmological models and observations .",
    "it is particularly difficult to explain the so called `` downsizing '' effect ( cowie , songalia @xmath4 hu 1996 ) , which on the other hand can be understood naturally in the hierarchical picture of galaxy formation .",
    "there is evidence that the most massive galaxies were formed in the early phases of the universe , having only modest star formation in the disk after the principal starburst event , whereas dimmer galaxies , in which most of the gas was not washed out in the main starburst event , continue actively forming stars until redshift zero ( cowie et al . 1996 ; ueda et al .",
    "2003 ; steffan et al .",
    "2003 ) . continued star formation in the central regions of dimmer galaxies might lead to the gradual formation of pseudobulges with young stellar populations .",
    "the fact that pseudobulges have been found repeatedly in late - type spirals ( andreakis , peletier @xmath4 balcells 1995 ; carollo , stiavelli @xmath4 mark 1998 ) , a class dominated by low luminosity spirals , fits to this picture . as shown by laurikainen , salo @xmath4 buta ( 2005 ) , however , massive early - type disk galaxies might also have disk - like bulges fairly frequently .",
    "disk - like rotationally supported bulges have been recently detected also kinematically in s0 galaxies by cappellari et al .",
    "as it is highly improbable that these disk - like bulges were formed by star formation in the disk , some other mechanism is needed to explain them .",
    "although not yet included explicitly in cosmological models , the intrinsic evolution of bars is among the most promising alternatives to explain pseudobulges in the early - type disk galaxies .",
    "theories of bar formation form an active field of investigation and many interesting results have been obtained .",
    "one of the most important discoveries has been that bars evolve due to angular momentum transfer between bars and dark matter halos , so that bars become longer and more massive when evolved over time ( athanassoula 2003 ) . in the early phases of evolution a bar develops a centrally concentrated inner part and a boxy / peanut - shaped structure , components which in dynamical models are generally interpreted as bulges .",
    "however , these models have not yet been fully tested with observations .",
    "for example , it is unclear to what extent the bulges in galaxies are classical bulges or pseudobulges , or what is the exact role of bars in the formation of pseudobulges ?",
    "another open question is what are the details of the angular momentum transfer mechanisms between bars and halos .",
    "this is because the dark matter halos and the bar pattern speeds are not well known in galaxies , and also because no systematic comparison of the observed and model - predicted properties of bars and bulges , covering all hubble type bins , has been done to date .",
    "the observed properties of bars in edge - on spirals have been compared with the dynamical models by ltticke , dettmar @xmath4 pohlen ( 2000 ) and bureau et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , but a similar comparison has not been made for more face - on galaxies nor for s0s .    in this",
    "study the properties of bars , bulges and ovals in the hubble sequence are studied and compared with various dynamical models in the literature . in order to characterize the nature of bulges we use a photometric approach by applying a 2d multicomponent decomposition method ( laurikainen , salo @xmath4 buta 2005 ) , and for a subsample of galaxies stellar kinematic observations are also collected from the literature .",
    "the properties of bars and ovals in the same galaxies are derived by fourier techniques .",
    "the decompositions and most of the fourier analysis for the individual galaxies have been published in a series of papers by us ( laurikainen et al .",
    "2004 , 2006a ; buta , salo @xmath4 laurikainen 2004 ; laurikainen , salo @xmath4 buta 2004 , 2005 ; buta et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "our aim in this paper is to combine all the analysis for the early- and late - type galaxies , and bring them together for a more general discussion in the hubble sequence .",
    "also , if any of the discussed parameters were not derived earlier for the whole sample of 216 galaxies , the analysis is completed in this study .",
    "such parameters are the ellipticities and the lengths of the bars for the early - type galaxies , and the fourier amplitude profiles and bar morphologies for the late - type galaxies .",
    "some preliminary results of this study have been reported in the iau conference proceeding by laurikainen et al .",
    "the sample used in this study consists of 216 galaxies , based on the ohio state university bright galaxy survey ( osubgs ; eskridge et al .",
    "2002 ) for spirals , and on the near infrared s0 galaxy survey ( nirs0s ; laurikainen , salo @xmath4 buta 2005 , buta et al .",
    "2006 ) for s0-s0/a galaxies .",
    "both are magnitude limited samples ( @xmath5 ) avoiding high inclination galaxies ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the nirs0s sample has been observed only partly so far , but when combined with the osubgs , a reasonable sized sample is obtained to study the properties of bars and bulges in the hubble sequence .",
    "figure 1 ( middle panel ) shows the mean galaxy brightness in each hubble type index bin .",
    "the magnitudes are total @xmath7-band magnitudes to the limiting surface brightness of @xmath8 , corrected to galactic extinction .",
    "the magnitudes are from two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and the extinction values are from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "the mean absolute brightnesses of the galaxies in our sample are very similar for the different hubble types , except for galaxies of types sc and later , which are dominated by dwarf galaxies .",
    "a large majority of the galaxies in our sample are bright : they are slightly brighter than the characteristic brightness @xmath7 = 23.1 in schechter s luminosity function ( gardner et al .",
    "the analysis discussed in this paper is based primarily on @xmath9-band ( the osubgs sample ) and @xmath7-band ( nirs0s sample ) images .",
    "the idea that some bulges might form by slow secular evolutionary processes after the initial rapid phase of galaxy formation was suggested already in 1982 by kormendy .",
    "these so called pseudobulges have more exponential surface brightness profiles than the classical bulges , whose surface brightness profiles closely resemble those found in elliptical galaxies .",
    "the concept of a pseudobulge comes in two different flavors : kormendy ( 1982 ; see also kk2004 ) has suggested that they are disk - like structures formed by star formation in the disk , whereas athanassoula ( 2005 ) has suggested two different types of pseudobulges , _ disk - like _ and _ boxy / peanut _ bulges . in her characterization boxy / peanut bulges are thick inner components of bars seen in edge - on galaxies , which structures are related to the characteristic orbital families of bars . generally we accept the wider concept of a pseudobulge .",
    "however , the way how boxy / peanut structures manifest in less inclined galaxies has not yet been studied in detail by simulations .",
    "therefore we adopt a term `` bar - related '' for all those pseudobulge candidates that seem unlikely to result from star formation , but which might be related to the orbital structure in bars . in the following potential pseudobulges",
    "are identified using the photometric and kinematic approaches , in a similar manner as suggested by kk2004 and kormendy @xmath4 fisher ( 2005 ) .",
    "the main idea is that if the bulges were formed by secular processes in galactic disks , they should remember their disky origin , which is expected to be visible in their surface brightness profiles , stellar populations , and stellar kinematics .      in order to identify potential pseudobulges we use",
    "the following criteria : ( 1 ) the surface brightness profiles are nearly exponential ( the shape parameter of the bulge @xmath10 2 ) , ( 2 ) the galaxies have nuclear bars , rings , or ovals in the disk inside the region of the bulge . in galaxies with pseudobulges the bulge - to - total flux ratio ( @xmath11 ) is generally small ( @xmath12 0.5 ) , although this is not a sufficient criterion to confirm the disk - like nature of the bulge . in our analysis",
    "we have used a 2d multicomponent decomposition algorithm ( laurikainen , salo @xmath4 buta 2005 ) which takes into account , not only the bulges and disks , but also multiple bars or ovals . for the bulges a generalized sersic function",
    "is used , and bars and ovals are typically fitted with a ferrers function .",
    "the decompositions for the individual galaxies discussed in this paper have been presented previously by laurikainen , salo @xmath4 buta ( 2004 , 2005 ) and by laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2006 ) .      in extensive studies , carollo and her collaborators ( carollo , stiavelli @xmath4 zeeuw 1997 ; carollo , stiavelli @xmath4 mark 1998 ; carollo et al .",
    "2002 ) have shown that late - type spirals ( sb - sbc ) frequently have star forming nuclear rings , inner spiral arms and inner disks .",
    "in many cases the inner disks are the only bulge - like structures in these galaxies , and some galaxies have no bulge at all .",
    "a pseudobulge has been recently found also in one early - type spiral galaxy , ngc 7690 , by kormendy et al .",
    "for some spiral galaxies there is also kinematic evidence confirming the disk - like nature of the bulge ( flcon - barroso et al .",
    "however , star formation related inner structures are expected to be less common in s0 galaxies , which are defficient of interstellar matter . in order to check the frequency of the inner structures we combined the data presented by laurikainen , salo @xmath4 buta ( 2005 ) and laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for s0-s0/a galaxies .",
    "we confirm the earlier result by laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showing that even 56 @xmath0 of s0-s0/a galaxies have either nuclear bars , nuclear disks or nuclear rings inside the bulge .",
    "one of the main results of our decomposition studies is that the typical @xmath11 flux ratio is considerably smaller than generally assumed , particularly for the early - type galaxies . in figure 1 ( upper panel )",
    "this is shown , for the first time , for all hubble types .",
    "for comparison , the mean @xmath11 flux - ratios derived by simien @xmath4 de vaucouleurs ( 1986 ) in the @xmath13-band are also shown .",
    "the difference to our result is very large : for example , while for s0-s0/a galaxies simien @xmath4 de vaucouleurs found @xmath14 = 0.57 , we find @xmath15 = 0.25 @xmath16 0.10 . one may ask whether this is a wavelength effect , related to the mass - to - luminosity ( @xmath17 ) ratio , or due to the different decomposition methods used ?",
    "if it is a wavelength effect we should conclude that recent star formation ( visible in the @xmath13-band ) in the bulge , relative to that in the disk , should be particularly significant in s0 galaxies , which is highly improbable . that the difference is not a wavelength effect becomes clear also by comparing our result with the decompositions made by de souza , gadotti @xmath4 dos anjos ( 2004 ) in the @xmath18-band . using their measurements ( their table 1 ) we find @xmath15 = 0.64 for s0s , which is very similar to that obtained by simien @xmath4 de vaucouleurs in the @xmath13-band . a correction related to",
    "different star formation time scales at different wavelengths ( taken from schulz et al .",
    "2003 ) is fairly small , changing the @xmath19 = 0.64 to @xmath20 = 0.54 ( see laurikainen , salo @xmath4 buta 2005 for more details ) .",
    "obviously wavelength is not capable of explaining the large difference in @xmath11 between this study and that by simien @xmath4 de vaucouleurs .",
    "a more likely explanation is that the more sophisticated multicomponent decomposition approach used in our study is capable of accounting for the effects of strong bars and ovals , structures which in the more simple 1d ( used by simien @xmath4 de vaucouleurs ) or 2d bulge / disk decompositions ( used by de souza , gadotti @xmath4 dos anjos ) are easily mixed with the bulges .",
    "in fact , it was shown by laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) that , when applied to the same barred galaxies , both 1d and 2d bulge / disk decompositions give fairly similar high @xmath11 ratios , whereas 2d bulge / disk / bar decompositions give significantly lower @xmath11 .",
    "laurikainen , salo @xmath4 buta ( 2005 ) used also synthetic data to demonstrate that most of the bar flux is erroneously assigned to the bulge , if a simple bulge / disk decomposition algorithm is applied to a system with a prominent bar .",
    "the @xmath21 flux ratios we find for spiral galaxies are also smaller than those obtained by simien @xmath4 de vaucouleurs , but the differences are much smaller , presumably because bars in these galaxies are smaller and thus affect less the decompositions .",
    "the mean @xmath11 flux ratios we find are smaller than typically found for classical bulges ( see kk2004 ) .",
    "if we assume that the mass - to - luminosity ( @xmath17 ) ratio is constant in these galaxies , the derived flux ratios are also approximations of the relative masses of bulges . in that case our result contradicts the earlier understanding according to which bulges and disks represent approximately equal amounts of mass in galaxies ( schechter @xmath4 dressler 1987 ; benson , frenk @xmath4 sharples 2002 ) .",
    "nevertheless , a constant @xmath17-ratio might be valid for most part of the disks , but not necessarily in the central regions of the galaxies .",
    "if the bulges were redder than the disk , higher @xmath17-ratios should be used for bulges ( bell @xmath4 de jong 2001 ) .",
    "the conversion of flux ratios to mass ratios will be made in a forthcoming paper , where colour index maps will be studied .",
    "another important finding in this study is that the shape parameter of the bulge , @xmath22 , is on average smaller than or near 2 for all morphological types ( fig .",
    "1 , lower panel ) . in the generalized sersic s function",
    "the value @xmath22 = 1 corresponds to an exponential disk and @xmath22 = 4 corresponds to the de vaucouleurs type surface brightness profile .",
    "if the concept of a disk - like pseudobulge is accepted this result seems to contradict with the view where only bulges in spiral galaxies later than sb have small enough @xmath22-values to be interpreted as pseudobulges ( carollo , stiavelli @xmath4 mark 1998 ; see also kk2004 ) .",
    "however , pseudobulges in early and late - type galaxies might be different .",
    "it has been shown both for spirals ( andreakis @xmath4 sanders 1994 ) and for elliptical galaxies ( caon , cappaccioli @xmath4 donofrio 1993 ) , that for the spheroidal component the generalized sersic s function ( used also in this study ) gives a better fit than the @xmath23-law . using a sersic s function for the bulge both andreakis , peletier @xmath4 balcells ( 1995 ) and de souza , gadotti @xmath4 dos anjos ( 2004 ) found large @xmath22-values particularly for s0 galaxies ( @xmath24=3.7 and 4.1 , respectively ) , whereas graham ( 2001 ) found @xmath24=2 for the galaxies with the same morphological types .",
    "the @xmath22-values given by graham are also similar to those obtained by us .",
    "how can we understand these disagreeing results ?",
    "one of the key issues is that the sample by graham did not include barred galaxies , thus any problems related to the degeneracy of bars and bulges were avoided .",
    "most probably the relative masses of bulges were overestimated in the decompositions by andreakis , peletier @xmath4 balcells thus leading also for an overestimate of the @xmath22-values .",
    "balcells et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have shown the importance of high image resolution when deriving the @xmath22-values in decompositions .",
    "they showed that the decompositions where ground - based images are combined with high resolution hubble space telescope ( hst ) images , give considerably lower @xmath22-values than the decompositions where only ground - based images are used .",
    "the small @xmath11 flux ratios and small @xmath22-values for s0-s0/a galaxies have been previously reported by laurikainen , salo @xmath4 buta ( 2005 ) and laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "we confirm the earlier result by balcells , graham @xmath4 peletier ( 2004 ) showing that galaxies are not scale free , the scale parameter being the relative mass of the bulge ( see fig .",
    "2 ) : both the shape parameter @xmath22 and the effective radius of the bulge normalized to the scale length of the disk , @xmath25 , correlate with @xmath11 .",
    "a critical @xmath11 value seems to be 0.1 , below which the bulge profiles are close to pure exponentials having @xmath22 @xmath26 1 .",
    "the @xmath18-band luminosities of these galaxies provide an interesting additional piece of information . for",
    "the late - type spirals the @xmath11 flux ratio increases nearly linearly towards brighter galaxies , whereas for the more early - type systems ( s0-sab ) @xmath11 seems to be independent of galaxy luminosity ( fig .",
    "2 , lower panel ) .",
    "if the bulges in the late - type spirals are largely pseudobulges formed by star formation in the disk , the found correlation can be understood assuming that the bulges are getting more massive when evolved over time , which is also the generally accepted view ( kk2004 ) .",
    "this is also consistent with our finding that most bulges among the late - type spirals have nearly exponential surface brightness profiles with @xmath22 = 1 - 1.5 .",
    "on the other hand , bulges in early - type disk galaxies are generally believed to have non - exponential surface brightness profiles , interpreted as evidence of their merger origin . however , as a large fraction of bulges also in s0 galaxies are fairly exponential we should ask how were these bulges formed ? the fact that there is no correlation between @xmath11 flux ratio and the galaxy luminosity is consistent with the picture that they have not enough gas that could accounted for the mass of the bulge via star formation . on the other hand , if these nearly exponential bulges were part of the bar one would expect some differences in the @xmath11 flux ratios and the @xmath22-values between the barred and the non - barred galaxies .",
    "figure 3 shows that such a difference seems in fact be present .",
    "the barred classification here is based on the de vaucouleurs s atlas of galaxies by buta , corwin @xmath4 odewahn ( 2007 ) .",
    "if the galaxy did not appear in the atlas , the classification was taken from the third reference catalog of bright galaxies ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ; hereafter rc3 ) .",
    "we also tested whether the differences in the distributions of @xmath22 and @xmath11-values between the barred and nonbarred s0 s are statistically significant .",
    "for that purpose the non - paramateric kolmogorov - smirnov test was used , and all morphological types with @xmath27 were grouped together . according to this test",
    "the differences between barred and nonbarred galaxies are real : the probability that their @xmath22-parameters are from the same distribution is only 0.02 .",
    "the same result applies to the b / t ratios .",
    "a similar test for later type galaxies ( @xmath28 ) indicated no difference between barred and nonbarred galaxies , as anticipated from fig .",
    "3 .    as any decomposition ,",
    "also our multicomponent approach has its limitations .",
    "a critical question is whether the uncertainties of the algorithm itself are so large that they alone could produce the found differences between the barred and non - barred galaxies ? one way of evaluating this is to look at how much massive nuclear bars or inner ovals can affect the @xmath11 flux ratio in the decompositions .",
    "this evaluation was done by laurikainen , salo @xmath4 buta ( 2005 ) who showed that the inclusion of prominent inner structures to the fit do not affect the @xmath22-value at all , compared to simple bulge / disk / bar decompositions , but can decrease the mean @xmath11 flux ratio by 0.05 , which is slightly smaller than the difference in @xmath11 between the barred and non - barred galaxies .",
    "another discriminator between the pseudobulges ( whether disk - like or bar - related ) and the classical bulges is based on the kinematic approach first suggested by illingworth ( 1977 ) : classical bulges are supported by random motions of stars ( illingworth 1981 ) , whereas pseudobulges are supported by rotational velocities ( kormendy 1981 ) .",
    "a useful discriminator is the parameter @xmath29 versus @xmath30 ( illingworth 1977 ; kormendy 1982 ) , where @xmath31 is the maximum rotational line of sight velocity of the bulge measured from the absorption lines , @xmath32 is the mean stellar line of sight velocity dispersion of the bulge just outside the nucleus , and @xmath30 is the characteristic ellipticity inside the radius of @xmath31",
    ". therefore @xmath29 measures the importance of rotation in supporting the galaxy against its self - gravity .    in table 1",
    "we have collected the stellar kinematic observations from the literature for all those galaxies in our sample that have measurements along the major axis of the disk .",
    "we use those major - axis position angles and inclinations that come out from our ellipse fitting to deep optical or near - infrared images using the ellipse routine in iraf ( pa / inc shown in the table ) .",
    "the bulge - dominated regions of the disks were evaluated , based on our structural decompositions ( the radius given in the table ) .",
    "@xmath31 was then taken to be the maximum line of sight rotational velocity inside the bulge - dominated region .",
    "the ellipticities inside the bulge dominated region were taken from the radial @xmath30-profiles .",
    "the last column in table 1 shows the references for the kinematic data .",
    "the data are shown in figure 4 , where the diagonal curve represents an isotropic oblate - spheroid model taken from binney ( 1978 ) . in the early diagrams by illingworth ( 1981 ) ,",
    "kormendy ( 1982 ) , and davies et al . (",
    "1983 ) the elliptical galaxies and bulges of disk galaxies supported by random velocities lie below the oblate line , whereas fast rotating disk - like bulges are expected to appear above that line .",
    "the reliability of this approach has been recently verified theoretically by binney ( 2005 ) .",
    "as the apparent ellipticity and the maximum rotational velocity of the bulge depend also on galaxy inclination , models with different inclinations were calculated by binney ( 2005 ) , who showed that the inclination would shift the data points in the @xmath29 versus @xmath30 diagram almost along the isotropic oblate rotator line .",
    "we find that the s0 galaxies in our sample appear both above and below the line .",
    "of these galaxies five appear above the line : one of these galaxies , having a high flattening is a non - barred galaxy , whereas the other four galaxies have primary bars and some of them also a nuclear ring . of the s0 galaxies below the line five",
    "are barred and two are non - barred galaxies , one galaxy has a clear secondary bar , and one galaxy has inner spiral arms .",
    "our emphasis here is not to do any detailed interpretation of the kinematic data as the study for early - type galaxies by cappellari et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , based on modeling of 2-dimensional kinematic observations .",
    "however , the kinematic data for the galaxies in our sample indicates that many of the early - type galaxies are likely to be rotationally supported .",
    "this is also consistent with the results obtained by cappellari et al .",
    "bars are generally characterized as `` strong '' when they are _ long _ and _ massive _ ( have large fourier amplitudes ) , and also when they _ have large ellipticities _ or the _ tangential forces induced by bars ( bar torques ) are large_. in de vaucouleurs family classification ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) bars are divided into strong ( b ) and weak ( ab ) bars , based mainly on visual inspection of how prominent the bar looks in the optical image , although the morphology of the bar also comes into the classification in the sense that weak bars typically have more oval - like morphologies .",
    "as the orbital families of bars strongly depend on the underlying gravitational potential , one would expect a clear correlation between the ellipticity of a bar and the bar torque , which is indeed found to be the case ( laurikainen , salo @xmath4 rautiainen 2002 ; buta , laurikainen @xmath4 salo 2004 ) .",
    "there are many optical ( elmegreen @xmath4 elmegreen 1985 ; martin 1995 ; erwin 2005 ) and infrared ( regan @xmath4 elmegreen 1997 ; laurikainen , salo @xmath4 rautiainen 2002 ; laurikainen , salo @xmath4 buta 2004 ) studies showing that bars in early - type spirals are longer than bars in late - type spirals .",
    "the estimation of bar length is not trivial ( see athanassoula 2005 ) , but the different bar length estimates ( visual inspection , maximum in the ellipticity profile , fourier phase angle , or the maximum in the force profile ) seem to lead to a similar conclusion .",
    "bars in early - type spirals are also found to have smaller ellipticities ( martin 1995 ; shlosman , peletier @xmath4 knapen 2000 ; whyte et al .",
    "2002 ; laurikainen et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ) and smaller bar torques ( laurikainen , salo @xmath4 rautiainen 2002 ; buta , laurikainen @xmath4 salo 2004 ) than bars in late - type spirals .    in figure 5",
    "we show four different bar strength indicators calculated for our sample of 216 galaxies : ( 1 ) @xmath1 ( bar torque ) , which is the maximum of relative tangential force in the bar region , normalized to the underlying mean axisymmetric force field , ( 2 ) the ellipticity of a bar using the @xmath3 index by whyte et al .",

    "we used @xmath36 derived from the maximum ellipticities in the bar region , obtained from our radial @xmath30-profiles , and corrected for the inclination of the disk ( see abraham et al .",
    "1999 ) . for completeness",
    ", the lengths of the bars for some of the galaxies in the nirs0s sample were also estimated in this study based on the phases of the fourier amplitudes , in a similar manner as estimated previously by us for the other galaxies in our sample .",
    "the strength of this comparison is that all bar strength indicators are calculated for the same galaxies using the same homogeneous database .",
    "the advantage of using ir - images is also well known : we are not missing bars that might be obscured by dust in the optical region , or where morphology might be masqueraded by pockets of star formation .    in figure 5",
    "we can look at separately the tendencies for the early ( shaded region ) and late - type ( non - shaded region ) galaxies .",
    "characteristic for the spiral galaxies is that bars become _ stronger _ towards the later hubble types when the bar torques are concerned , and _ weaker _ when the lengths or the relative masses of bars are concerned .",
    "these tendencies for spiral galaxies have been previously shown by laurikainen , salo @xmath4 buta ( 2004 ) , and for bar torques also by buta , laurikainen @xmath4 salo ( 2004 ) .",
    "buta et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also showed that in some cases spiral arms might affect the bar torques ( in which case @xmath37 was used ) .",
    "figure 6 we shows that any superposition of spiral arms with bars does not significantly affect the found tendency for the bar torques in the hubble sequence . for @xmath3 there might be a similar increase toward later types as found for bar torques , but it is not as clear : actually any possible variations in the ellipticity in the hubble sequence are within the error bars .",
    "this is consistent with the result obtained by marinova @xmath4 jogee ( 2006 ) who found that the ellipticity of a bar is practically independent of the hubble type . in any case",
    "we find that bar torque , @xmath1 , is well correlated with @xmath3 for all morphological types ( fig .",
    "this correlation exists also if spiral - corrected @xmath37 is used , but in that case the dispersion is somewhat larger . the apparent inconsistency between the bar length and the relative mass of a bar in one hand , and the bar torque on the other hand , has been discussed by laurikainen , salo @xmath4 buta ( 2004 ) for the spiral galaxies .",
    "they showed that although bars in the early - type spirals are longer and more massive , the bar - induced tangential forces are weaker , because they are diluted by the more massive bulges in these systems .",
    "on the other hand , figure 5 also shows that the trends we find for spiral galaxies do not extend to s0s , which might be an important clue while evaluating the evolutionary history of galaxies in the hubble sequence .",
    "bars in the _ early - type s0 galaxies _ are clearly shorter ( see also erwin 2005 ) and less massive than bars in the _ later - type s0s or in s0/a galaxies_. for bar torques and ellipticities the opposite might be true , but the number of galaxies in our sample is too small to confirm that . in the bar torque approach the largest uncertainty is related to the assumed vertical thickness of the bar ( laurikainen @xmath4 salo 2002 ) .",
    "we used a vertical thickness based on the empirical relation between the morphological type and the vertical thickness of the disk , as estimated by de grijs ( 1998 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this uncertainty ( see fig .",
    "6 , in laurikainen et al . 2004 ) is clearly smaller than the trend we find for bar torques in the hubble sequence .",
    "the fourier amplitude profiles of 26 s0-s0/a galaxies in our sample have been previously studied by buta et al .",
    "they showed that the @xmath2 amplitude profiles of bars can be fitted by symmetric gaussian functions , using either single ( sg ) , double ( dg ) , or multiple ( mg ) gaussian functions . in buta",
    "bars fitted by a double gaussian function were found to have , on average , larger bar torques than bars fitted by a single gaussian function . in the following",
    "we discuss the other bar strength indicators and the properties of bulges in the same galaxies . as the mg - type profiles are generally very complex we concentrate only on the sg and dg - type bars in the following .",
    "the mean parameters of bars and bulges for these galaxies are collected to table 3 .",
    "we find that dg - type bars not only have stronger bar torques , but that they are also more elliptical , longer and more massive than sg - type bars .",
    "there is also a small difference in the properties of bulges between these two groups of galaxies in the sense that the galaxies with dg - type bars have slightly less massive and more exponential bulges than the galaxies with sg - type bars .",
    "both groups of galaxies have similar @xmath7-band luminosities , which eliminates the possibility that the found differences were due to a magnitude bias .    in order to understand better the sg and dg nature of bars",
    ", we picked up four characteristic examples of early - type galaxies and inspected their properties in more detail ( see fig .",
    "ngc 3941 is a typical example of a galaxy with an sg - type bar , whereas ngc 4245 , ngc 2859 and ngc 1452 have dg - type bars . for ngc 3941 the maxima in the @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath38 amplitude profiles appear at the same radial distance , a behavior which is characteristic for sg - type bars .",
    "however , in some other sg - type bars like ngc 1440 , the lower modes are shifted towards slightly smaller radial distances .",
    "ngc 3941 has two amplitude maxima in the @xmath2-profile , the main maximum belonging to the primary bar , and the lower maximum ( at r@xmath125  ) to an inner disk .",
    "the radial @xmath39-profile follows the @xmath2 amplitude profile so that the two @xmath39-maxima appear at the same radial distances as the two amplitude maxima .",
    "the surface brightness profile of this galaxy is well fitted when including a bulge , a disk and a bar in the fit .",
    "sg - type profiles were found to appear both among the primary and the secondary bars , but all clearly identified secondary bars have sg - type amplitude profiles .    by definition in buta",
    "et al . ( 2006 ) , dg - type bars have a broad @xmath2 amplitude profile , of which category the galaxies ngc 4245 , ngc 2859 and ngc 1452 are representative examples .",
    "ngc 4245 has two density peaks both in the lower ( @xmath2 ) and in the higher fourier modes ( @xmath34 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "again , the radial @xmath39-profile follows the @xmath2 amplitude profile : one can imagine that the broad maximum is actually a superposition of two partially overlapping @xmath39-peaks . in the structural decomposition these two components",
    "were fitted by two oval / bar components .",
    "the interpretation is that the bar has two components , namely a short inner bar , and a longer outer bar .",
    "it is highly improbable that the inner component is an oval , because the higher fourier modes are also visible . in order to identify better",
    "the components both in the amplitude profile and in the decomposition plot , in figure 8 the peaks from the gaussian fitting are also shown .",
    "the parameters for calculating these peaks were taken from table 3 in buta et al .",
    "ngc 1452 has a broad double peaked @xmath2 amplitude profile , but in this case the higher fourier modes ( @xmath34 , @xmath38 and @xmath40 ) appear clearly only at r @xmath26 35  , which is the more distant component of the @xmath2 double peak .",
    "also , the @xmath39-profile does not completely follow the @xmath2 amplitude profile : the peak in the @xmath39-profile is fairly sharp and coincides with the radial distance where the higher fourier modes are also significant .",
    "this maximum evidently corresponds to a bar , a component which appears also in the surface brightness profile at a similar radial distance .",
    "the strongest @xmath2 maximum appears at @xmath41 @xmath26 20  , where the higher fourier modes are weak or absent . at this radial distance",
    "there is only a weak shoulder in the @xmath39-profile .",
    "most probably this @xmath2 maximum corresponds to a bright oval , identified also in the structural decomposition .",
    "this example shows that although an oval might have a fairly high relative mass , it does not necessarily induce strong tangential forces .",
    "it also shows the power of the higher fourier modes in discriminating ovals from thick inner components of bars .",
    "ngc 2859 has a very broad @xmath2 amplitude profile , but in this case the higher fourier modes appear only at fairly small radial distances ( r @xmath12 40  ) .",
    "the @xmath39-profile is extremely shallow showing only a modest peak at the radial distance where the higher fourier modes are present ( r @xmath26 40  ) .",
    "our conclusion is that the @xmath2-profile is broad because the galaxy has a weak bar and a prominent oval extending outside the bar , a conclusion made also by buta et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for this galaxy .",
    "the small peak in the @xmath2 amplitude profile at r @xmath12 10  , visible also in the surface brightness profile and in the @xmath39-profile , corresponds to a secondary bar .    in conclusion ,",
    "the broad or double peaked @xmath2 amplitude profiles of bars in the early - type galaxies correspond either to a two - component bar with a thick inner part and a thin outer part , or a superposition of a bar and an oval ( small or extended ) .",
    "many dg - type bars in these galaxies are two - component bars . we find that the dg - type bars are on average stronger than the more simple sg - type bars using all four bar strength indicators . bars and ovals can be distinguished from each other by inspecting also the higher fourier modes , which are significant in bars , but not in ovals ( due to their smaller ellipticities ) .",
    "strong bars are also found to have fairly sharp outer cut - offs in the @xmath2-profiles , in agreement with the finding by ohta ( 2002 ) .",
    "we inspected the fourier amplitude profiles also for all galaxies in the osubgs sample as well , although due to the prominence of spiral arms the interpretation of these profiles is not always straightforward .",
    "for this reason , any quantitative comparison of sg / dg type bars in different hubble type bins was not possible .",
    "however , similar density profiles as found for the early - type galaxies were found also for the spirals .",
    "examples of characteristic sg and dg - type profiles of bars in spiral galaxies are collected in figure 9 . as in fig .",
    "8 , the radial @xmath39-profiles and fourier amplitude profiles are shown .",
    "the bar in ngc  4321 manifests itself with a rather weak outer part , affected in morphology by the spiral arms , and an aligned inner part which is well - defined in the near - ir ( knapen et al . 1995 ) .",
    "this secondary bar , with a length of some 10 arcsec , has a clear sg - type morphology .",
    "the morphological type of this galaxy is sab(s)bc , but the amplitude profile of the bar is similar as in any other morphological type : the density maximum is sharp and in addition to the @xmath2 component the higher fourier modes , @xmath34 and @xmath38 ( even @xmath40 is present ) , are also prominent .",
    "all modes appear nearly at the same radial distance , which is also the location of the @xmath39-maximum .",
    "the five remaining galaxies in figure 9 are candidates of dg - type bar profiles , similar to those discussed among the early - type galaxies above .",
    "for example , ngc 3583 clearly has a two - component maximum at r @xmath12 40  , both in the lower and in the higher fourier modes , indicating that the bar has both an inner and an outer component .",
    "the @xmath39-peak is also very broad .",
    "however the phase of the @xmath2 component is maintained nearly constant only to @xmath41 @xmath26 25  , which suggests that the outer part of the bar has some spiral - like characteristics , as is visible also in the direct image of this galaxy .",
    "the galaxies ngc 4394 and ngc 7479 are more clear examples of two - component bars .",
    "bars in these galaxies have qualitatively similar double - peaked amplitude profiles with prominent higher fourier modes .",
    "the bar in ngc 4593 is qualitatively similar to those in ngc 4394 and ngc 7479 .",
    "the large @xmath2 maximum at @xmath41 @xmath26 70  is caused by the prominent spiral arms starting at the two ends of the bar .",
    "ohta , hawabe @xmath4 wakamasu ( 1990 ) were the first to discover that the higher fourier modes of bars are characteristic for early - type galaxies , like s0s .",
    "they also argued that these modes are absent for the bars in spiral galaxies .",
    "however , our analysis indicates that the higher fourier modes are characteristic for _ all _ strong bars , independent of the morphological type .",
    "for example , the amplitudes of the higher modes are extremely strong in the sc - type spiral galaxy ngc 7479 , having @xmath1=0.7 , and weaker for ngc 6221 ( @xmath1 = 0.44 ) .",
    "according to ohta ( 1996 ) the early - type galaxies also have sharp cut - offs in the amplitude profiles at the ends of the bar , but such cut - offs were argued to be missing in bars of late - type galaxies . due to the strong spiral arms , the shapes of the amplitude profiles in the spiral galaxies are difficult to evaluate . however , ngc 7479 is an example showing that strong bars can have fairly sharp outer cut - offs in their @xmath2-profiles also in the late - type spirals .",
    "most probably , this property is also related to the strength of the bar rather than to the morphological type .",
    "as an example of an early - type bar ohta used ngc 4643 , a galaxy which is also in our sample , and shows a fairly strong bar ( @xmath1=0.3 ) .",
    "in the hierarchical clustering model of the universe dominated by cold dark matter ( toomre @xmath4 toomre 1972 ; white @xmath4 rees 1978 ; steinmetz @xmath4 navarro 2002 ) the dominant mechanism for producing bulges is by mergers of disk galaxies .",
    "mergers of equal mass galaxies also yield remnants with properties similar to those found in the elliptical galaxies ( barnes 1988 ; hernquist 1993 ; lima - neto @xmath4 combes 2005 ; balcells @xmath4 gonzalez 1998 ) .",
    "however , a problem with these models is that the properties of bulges in spiral galaxies and , as discussed in this study , even in early - type disk galaxies , do not resemble those of the elliptical galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , it is not clear how strict the criterion for the merger origin is : there is recent evidence based on the cosmological dynamical models by springer @xmath4 hernquist ( 2005 ) showing that if sufficient gas remains following a major merger , cooling can quickly reform the disk .",
    "this yields remnants that are closer to spiral galaxies , both structurally and kinematically .",
    "if this is correct , bulges might still be remnants of hierarchical clustering , particularly in the non - barred early - type galaxies",
    ". however , detailed comparison between observations and model predictions are not yet possible .",
    "the fact that the bulges in the spiral galaxies are nearly exponential is consistent with the picture according to which the bulges are largely part of the disk formed by star formation in the disk .",
    "the @xmath11-ratios are also small and @xmath11 flux ratio increases with galaxy luminosity .",
    "this can be understood if gas from the outer disk is accreted to the inner parts during the galaxy evolution .",
    "galaxies with higher luminosities have more gas in the disk that can accumulate into starbursting rings and eventually lead to increased bulge masses .",
    "support for this scenario comes from the recent spitzer space telescope observations by fisher ( 2006 ) who showed that galaxies which are structurally identified as having pseudobulges , also have higher central star formation rates than those having classical bulges .",
    "bars may help in transferring the gas towards the central regions of the galaxies , but they are not a necessary requirement for the gas inflow ( sakamoto et al . 1999 ; sheth et al .",
    "the predominance of old stellar populations and the de vaucouleurs type surface brightness profile are generally used to claim that bulges in s0-s0/a galaxies are merger - built structures ( schweizer 2005 ) .",
    "also , they do not seem to have sufficient gas for producing star formation at a level that could account for the masses of typical pseudobulges ( see kk2004 ) .",
    "however , as discussed in this study , bulges in the early - type galaxies have many signatures of pseudobulges .",
    "for example , they have fairly exponential bulges , 56@xmath0 of them have inner structures like nuclear rings or nuclear bars , and some of them also have kinematic evidence of rotationally supported bulges .",
    "there is also a large kinematic study of e / s0 galaxies by emsellen et al .",
    "( 2005 , and references there ) using high resolution integral field spectroscopy for deriving the kinematic parameters .",
    "they found that the bulges in most s0s galaxies are fast rotating systems having also large anisotropies of the bulge .",
    "these kinematic properties were suggested to indicate either secular evolution , or heating of the disk due to minor mergers .",
    "our interpretation in this study is that pseudobulges in the early - type disk galaxies are largely bar - related , connected to the evolution of bars .",
    "this could also naturally explain why the bulges are non - classical even in such gas poor galaxies as s0s .",
    "in modern dynamical models , bars are expected to play an important role in galaxy evolution ( athanassaoula 2003 ) .",
    "the main idea is that bars evolve due to angular momentum transfer between the bar and the halo , which occurs near the resonances : in particular disk material at the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) will lose angular momentum , while halo material near corotation ( cr ) and near the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) will absorb it .",
    "how strong this angular momentum exchange is depends critically on the mass of the halo and its central concentration , the amount of mass in the resonances , and how dynamically cool or hot are the disk and the halo . athanassoula ( 2003 )",
    "reports three different ways of how bars can lose angular momentum : ( 1 ) by trapping particles outside the bar into elongated orbits of the bar , a process in which angular momentum is lost from the inner parts of the disk , while the bar becomes _ longer _ , ( 2 ) part or all of the orbits trapped in the bar become more elongated and the bar becomes _ thinner _ , and ( 3 ) bars lose rotational energy leading to a _",
    "slow bar_. these three processes are expected to be linked , so that due to strong angular momentum transfer bars simultaneously become longer , thinner and more slowly rotating .",
    "athanassoula s models ( 2003 ) have also shown that while bars become longer , their relative masses increase .",
    "these trends have been verified later by other self - consistent 3d simulation studies like those made by martinez - valpuesta , shlosman @xmath4 heller ( 2006 ) .",
    "the first indication that bars grow when they evolved over time comes already from dynamical models by sellwood ( 1980 ) .",
    "our observations show that bars become longer and more massive from the late - type spirals towards the early - type spirals .",
    "these observations are consistent with the models by athanassoula ( 2003 ) if either the dark matter halos or the bulges in the early - type galaxies are more massive or more centrally concentrated than the halos and bulges in late - type galaxies .",
    "our observations can be understood by the same models also if the bars in the early - type galaxies are very old structures , in which case even smaller halos might be sufficient to cause the angular momentum transfer . in that case",
    "we might also be witnessing slow evolution of bars in galaxies that gradually lose their gas and change their morphological type in the hubble sequence .",
    "a possible candidate of such evolution is the non - barred galaxy ngc 1411 , which is classified as an s0 galaxy , but has a @xmath11 flux ratio which is as small as typically found in sc - type spirals ( see laurikainen et al .",
    "2006 ) .    on the other hand , and at odds with the model predictions",
    ", our analysis also shows that bars do not have larger bar torques nore become more elliptical , towards the early - type spirals .",
    "this behavior of the bar torque ( @xmath1 ) and the ellipticity of the bar ( @xmath3 ) however , should not necessarily be taken as a counterargument to the evolutionary models by athanassoula .",
    "this is because @xmath1 is diluted by the underlying axisymmetric component , generally the bulge , which is more massive in the early - type galaxies , and which is generally not taken into account in the simulations",
    ". it would be interesting if the simulations could confirm whether the opposite trends found in the hubble sequence among the different bar strength indicators can be completely explained by the dilution effect due to more massive bulges in the early - type galaxies as suggested by laurikainen , salo @xmath4 buta ( 2004 ) , or whether this result is also related to the different mechanisms of how bars lose their angular momentum .",
    "an additional verification for the hypothesis that bars evolve because they lose angular momentum would be to show that long , evolved bars are more slowly rotating systems than shorter and less evolved bars .",
    "however , this has been difficult to prove , mainly because of the difficulties to measure the bar pattern speed , @xmath42 .",
    "so far , @xmath42 has been measured directly using the tremaine - weinberg method for some s0 galaxies ( merrifield @xmath4 kuijken 1995 : gerssen , kuijken @xmath4 merrifield 2003 ; aguerri , debattista @xmath4 corsini 2003 ; corsini , debattista @xmath4 aguerri 2003 ; rand @xmath4 wallin 2004 ; debattista @xmath4 williams 2004 ) , and only for two spiral galaxies ( gerssen , kuijken @xmath4 merrifiled 2003 ) .",
    "these direct measurements of @xmath42 have repeatedly pointed to fast bars in the early - type galaxies , contrary to what one would expect for evolved bars .",
    "the largest collection of @xmath42 measurements for spiral galaxies comes from the 2d sticky particle simulation ( salo et al .",
    "1999 ) models for 38 spiral galaxies in the osubgs sample by rautiainen , salo @xmath4 laurikainen ( 2005 ) and salo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who showed that the bars in late - type spirals are actually slower rotators than those in early - type spirals . in principle , this could be related to the dark matter halos , because according to persic , salucci @xmath4 stel ( 1996 ) the relative halo mass depends on galaxy luminosity so that galaxies with lower luminosities also have more massive dark matter haloes . however , in the osubgs sample the luminosities of sb and sbc galaxies , for which lower @xmath42-values were found , have on average the same luminosities as the early - type spirals .",
    "therefore , mass of the dark matter halo alone is not sufficient to explain the slowdown rate of the bar in the late - type spirals .",
    "more measurements of @xmath42 and of the rotation curves are evidently needed to clarify this issue .",
    "a completely different view of the evolution of bars in spiral galaxies has been presented by bournaud @xmath4 combes ( 2002 ) , who suggest that in the presence of continuous accretion of external gas bars become fairly short - lived systems , so that bars are recurrently formed and destroyed . in principle",
    "this is possible , but our observations do not shed any new light on this issue .",
    "the recent simulations by debattista et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggest that bars are actually fairly robust systems so that high gas masses are required to destroy the bars .",
    "somewhat smaller gas masses to destroy bars are suggested in the simulation models by hozumi @xmath4 hernquist ( 2005 ) , bounaud , combes @xmath4 semelin ( 2005 ) , and athassoula , lambert @xmath4 dehnen ( 2005 ) .",
    "bar strength measurements alone are not sufficient to distinguish whether bars are strong mainly because they have massive dark matter halos , or because the strong bars are very old , formed in the epoch when they still had a large amount of gas .",
    "whatever the case , something is different in galaxies with s0/a type morphologies .",
    "for very early types the bars start to decrease in length and lose their mass , probably accompanied by smaller bulge components .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that the internal evolution of bars plays an important role in producing these characteristics .",
    "the evolution of stellar bars is affected by dynamical instabilities leading to long - term changes in their morphologies .",
    "a well known is the so called buckling instability ( combes et al .",
    "1990 ; pfenniger @xmath4 friedli 1991 ; raha et al .",
    "1991 ; berenzen et al .",
    "1998 ; athanassoula @xmath4 misioritis 2002 ; athanassoula 2002 , 2003 , 2005a , b ; oneilss @xmath4 dubinski 2003 ; debattista et al .",

    "2006 ; martinez - valpuesta , shlosman @xmath4 heller 2006 ) , where the orbital families of bars are changed in such a manner that leads to a vertical thickening of the bar , the so called boxy / peanut structure . in recent studies ( martinez - valpuesta , shlosman @xmath4 heller 2006 ; athanassoula 2006 ) multiple buckling effects have also been discussed .",
    "buckling is expected to be a natural part of the evolution of bars , being particularly important in strong bars .",
    "the presence of boxy / peanut bulges for edge - on galaxies has previously been shown both kinematically ( kuijken @xmath4 merrifield 1995 ; chung @xmath4 bureau 2004 ) and using surface photometry ( ltticke , dettmar @xmath4 pohlen 2000 ; bureau et al .",
    "ltticke , dettmar @xmath4 pohlen found that 54@xmath0 of the bulges of all morphological types among edge - on galaxies have boxy / peanut bulges , which implies that they should be common also among the less inclined galaxies .    when a bar forms in numerical simulations it is thin , but soon develops a vertically thick inner part and a vertically thick more extended middle component of the bar ( athanassoula 2003 , 2005 ) . in the surface brightness profiles",
    "both vertically thick components can be interpreted as pseudobulges . in the simulation models",
    "the surface brightness profile of the innermost component of the bar is nearly exponential , whereas for the middle component it depends on the viewing angle : when viewed edge - on the profile takes a freeman type ii profile shape .",
    "also the length of the peanut structure depends on the viewing angle so that it is longest in the edge - on galaxies ( athanassoula @xmath4 beaton 2006 ) .",
    "the strength of the peanut structure depends on bar strength so that it is strongest in strong bars ( athanassoula @xmath4 misioritis 2002 ; bureau @xmath4 athanassoula 2005 ) .",
    "strong bars in simulation models are also found to have frequently ansae - type morphologies ( athanassoula @xmath4 misioritis 2002 ; athanassoula , lambert @xmath4 dehnen 2005 ; athanassoula @xmath4 beaton 2006 ; martinez - valpuesta , shlosman @xmath4 heller 2006 ) .    however , a comparison of the observations with the simulation models is difficult because different parts of the bars are seen in face - on and in edge - on views .",
    "this has been demonstrated for example by athanassoula @xmath4 beaton ( 2006 ) , who showed that although the boxy / peanut structure is visible at an inclination of 77@xmath43 , the length of this structure is shorter at this inclination than in the edge - on view . also , in face - on view the boxy / peanut structure is barely visible .",
    "based on these difficulties we can not argue that the bulges we see in the early - type galaxies are boxy / peanut structures produced by buckling effects .",
    "however , we have shown strong evidence that bars in the early - type galaxies are evolved systems , which is also the case with the boxy / peanut shaped bar / bulges in the simulation models . namely , we find that 90@xmath0 of early - type galaxies have either flat or intermediate - type fourier amplitude profiles , and 40@xmath0 have ansae bar morphologies . in comparison ,",
    "the amplitude profiles in spiral galaxies are mostly exponential and only 12@xmath0 show ansae - type morphologies ( 14 with ansae among 115 osubgs galaxies ) . , knapen 2007 , private communication ] also , by comparing the fourier amplitude profiles and the multicomponent decompositions for the same galaxies we identify inner structures that can not be explained by the classical bulges or ovals .",
    "buta et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that the observed flat - top amplitude profiles are at least consistent with models with large dark matter halos , but other factors as centrally concentrated halo mass profiles or enough mass in the resonances might also lead to similar evolved amplitude profiles .",
    "therefore , both the morphological analysis of bars and bar strengths in s0-s0/a galaxies hint to evolved bars .",
    "however , what still needs to be explained in this picture is why bars in the s0-s0/a galaxies are repeatedly found to be fast ? and also , why bars , particularly in the early - type s0s , are less prominent than bars in the later type s0s or in s0/a galaxies ?",
    "none of this is expected in models where bars evolve due to a significant transfer of the angular momentum from the bar to the halo .",
    "it has been shown by martinez - valpuesta , shlosman @xmath4 heller ( 2006 ) that the connection between the different properties of bars might actually be a complicated process , so that during the buckling process @xmath42 sharply increases , followed by a sudden decrease in bar length . however , even in this model the bar should both grow in length and slow down in the long run , so that after the second buckling the bar should be more prominent and more slowly rotating than after the first buckling .",
    "there are other models , however , like those by athanassoula , lambert and dehnen ( 2005 ) , that can account better for the observed properties of bars in the s0 galaxies .",
    "they showed that if central mass concentrations like realistic secondary bars or nuclear disks are used in the models , bars become shorter , less massive and faster than in models without any centrally concentrated mass components .",
    "nuclear bars and inner disks appear in more than 50@xmath0 of the studied s0-s0/a galaxies in our sample , implying that the models by athanassoula , lambert @xmath4 dehnen are a promising explanation for the type of bars we find in the very early - type galaxies . in the context of evolution",
    "it would be natural to expect that the early - type s0 galaxies are older than the late - type s0s or s0/a galaxies , which implies that their bars have had more time to evolve : in this case to become less prominent .",
    "ultimately , the efficiency of nuclear bars and disks in redistributing matter in the disk is related to the problem of cuspy halos : if the halos are cuspy as assumed in present cosmological models , the central parts of the galaxies are halo dominated , thus reducing the effects discussed by athanassoula , lambert @xmath4 dehnen ( 2005 ) .",
    "but if the halos have constant density cores then their models might efficiently produce the type of bars found in s0s .",
    "although it seems that bars in early - type galaxies have many characteristics of evolved systems , the details of the mechanism of the angular momentum transfer between the bar and the dark matter halo remains unsolved .",
    "even if bars evolve due to the angular momentum transfer between the bar and the halo the time scale of the evolution can be either rapid or more slow , which is expected to have imcplications to the ages of bars and the masses of dark matter haloes .",
    "the masses of the halos in the early - type galaxies are poorly known , but the rotation curve observations by mathieu , merrifield @xmath4 kuijken ( 2002 , see also romanowsky 2006 ) seem to indicate that the halo masses in s0 galaxies might actually be quite small .",
    "bulges are expected to affect the evolution of bars in a similar manner as the dark matter halos ( athanassoula 2003 ) , but this has not yet been tested using realistic @xmath11-ratios for galaxies in the different hubble type bins .",
    "properties of bars and bulges in the hubble sequence are discussed , based on the analysis of 216 disk galaxies , selected from the osubgs and nirs0s samples .",
    "our main emphasis has been to combine the various properties of bars and bulges , presented for the individual galaxies in a series of papers by us , and to discuss the implications of these measurements in the hubble sequence .",
    "the properties of bars were derived mainly by fourier techniques and the properties of bulges by applying a multicomponent decomposition code .",
    "the analysis results were compared with various dynamical models in the literature .",
    "we find strong photometric and kinematic evidence of pseudobulges in the s0-s0/a galaxies .",
    "however , most probably pseudobulges in the early and late - type galaxies have a different origin , which would also make more understandable why pseudobulges are frequently found in such gas poor galaxies as in s0s .",
    "our main results are the following :    \\(1 ) we show both photometric and kinematic evidence that the bulges in many s0-s0/a galaxies have characteristics of pseudobulges : they have on average small shape parameters and 56@xmath0 of them have inner components as nuclear bars or nuclear rings , confirming the earlier results by laurikainen et al . ( 2006 ) .",
    "kinematic data collected from the literature is in many cases consistant with rotationally supported bulges .",
    "\\(2 ) we find evidence showing that pseudobulges in the late - type galaxies were formed by star formation in the disk , while in the early - type galaxies ( s0-s0/a ) they are mainly bar - related structures .",
    "this interpretation is based on the decompositions , which show that these components have nearly exponential surface brightness profiles , and on fourier analysis showing flat - top / double - peaked amplitude profiles , where the higher fourier modes are also important .",
    "\\(3 ) we find that bars with flat - top / double peaked amplitude profiles are stronger that the more simple bars , using all bar strength indicators : bar torque ( @xmath1 ) , the ellipticity of a bar ( @xmath3 ) , the relative mass a bar ( @xmath2 ) and the length of a bar .",
    "galaxies with flat - top / double - peaked amplitude profiles have also slightly more exponential bulges and lower @xmath11 flux ratios than the more simple bars .",
    "\\(4 ) strong bars are found to have the following characteristics : 1 ) flat - top / double peaked amplitude profiles 2 ) sharp outer cut - offs , 3 ) a presence of higher fourier modes , and 4 ) in many cases ansae - type bar morphologies .",
    "we found that 40@xmath0 of s0-s0/a galaxies have ansae , in contrast to 13@xmath0 in spiral galaxies .",
    "flat - top / double or intermediate - type amplitude profiles are found in 92@xmath0 of s0-s0/a galaxies , whereas amplitude profiles of bars in spiral galaxies are largely exponential .",
    "\\(5 ) the distributions of bar strength in different hubble type bins are shown using four different bar strength indicators , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and bar length , which is expected to give important clues for understanding the mechanism of how bars lose their angular momentum and thus evolve over time .",
    "for example , it needs to be understood why bars in the early - type s0 galaxies are less prominent than bars in the later type s0s or in s0/a galaxies .",
    "\\(7 ) even 70 @xmath0 of s0-s0/a galaxies are found to have ovals or lenses , confirming the earlier result by laurikainen et al .",
    "according to dynamical models by athanassoula ( 2003 ) weak ovals may form in hot halos and more extended ovals in hot disks .",
    "we find both weak and expended ovals and thin classical bars in the same galaxies , which needs to be explained by the theoretical models .",
    "we wish to thank lia athanassoula and inma martinez - valpuesta for valuable comments to this manuscript .",
    "we also thank anna mkinen for collecting the kinematic data from the literature , as a summer work in the astronomy division , univ . of oulu .",
    "the support from the academy of finalnd is acknowledged .",

    "<S> properties of bars and bulges in the hubble sequence are discussed , based on the analysis of 216 disk galaxies ( s0s and spirals from nirs0s and osubgs surveys , respectively ) . for that purpose </S>",

    "<S> we find strong photometric and kinematic evidence of pseudobulges in the s0-s0/a galaxies : their bulges are on average fairly exponential , inner disks are common ( in 56@xmath0 ) , and in many of the galaxies the bulges are rotationally supported </S>",
    "<S> . this would be difficult to understand in such gas poor galaxies as in s0s , if these pseudobulge candidates were formed by star formation in the disk in a a similar manner as in spirals . </S>",
    "<S> a more likely explanation is that pseudobulges in the early - type galaxies are bar - related structures , connected to the evolution of bars , which interpretation is supported by our fourier analysis and structural decompositions . </S>",
    "<S> bars in the early - type galaxies are found to have many characteristics of evolved systems : ( 1 ) they have flat - top / double peaked fourier amplitude profiles , ( 2 ) bars have typically sharp outer cut - offs , ( 3 ) the higher fourier modes appear in the amplitude profiles , and ( 4 ) many bars have also ansae - type morphologies . </S>",
    "<S> we show the distributions of bar strength in different hubble type bins using four bar strength indicators , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the bar length , which are expected to give important clues for understanding the mechanism of how bars evolve .    </S>",
