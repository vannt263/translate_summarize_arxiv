    "the kuramoto model describes the phenomenon of collective synchronization , more precisely it describes how the phases of coupled oscillators evolve in time , see @xcite for more details .",
    "recently bertini , giacomin and pakdaman @xcite were able to review some results on the kuramoto model from a statistical mechanics standpoint and they gave in particular necessary and sufficient conditions for reversibility . in order to do this bertini , giacomin and pakdaman @xcite deduced some lower and upper bounds for the asympotic order parameter , which involves the modified bessel functions of the first kind of order zero and one .",
    "a few years later sonnenschein and schimansky - geier @xcite obtained the asymptotic order parameter in closed form , which suggested a tighter upper bound for the corresponding scaling .",
    "moreover , they elaborated the gaussian approximation in complex networks with distributed degrees .",
    "in their study sonnenschein and schimansky - geier @xcite proposed another upper bound for the asymptotic order parameter , but they presented their result without mathematical proof .",
    "all the same , by using bernoulli s inequality they verified that their upper bound is better than the upper bound of bertini , giacomin and pakdaman @xcite . in this paper",
    "our aim is to make a contribution to this subject by showing the followings :    1 .",
    "the bounds presented in the above mentioned papers are correct and their proofs are based on some turn type inequalities for modified bessel functions of the first kind .",
    "2 .   the constants in the upper bounds presented by bertini , giacomin , pakdaman @xcite and sonnenschein , schimansky - geier @xcite are the best , and thus their bounds can not be improved .",
    "the results presented in the above mentioned papers can be extended to modified bessel functions of the first kind of arbitrary order , based on some interesting new and recently discovered turn type inequalities for modified bessel functions of the first kind .",
    "it is possible to obtain another approximation for the asymptotic order parameter ( than in the above mentioned papers ) by means of the lagrange s inversion theorem and also a rational approximation .",
    "as far as we know the above mentioned subject was not studied yet in details from the mathematical point of view and we believe that the obtained results may be useful for the people working in statistical physics .",
    "in this section our aim is to discuss , complement and extend the results from @xcite concerning bounds for the asymptotic order parameter of the stochastic kuramoto model . some new and recently discovered turn type inequalities for modified bessel functions of the first kind play an important role in this section . for more details on turn type inequalities for modified bessel functions of the first kind",
    "we refer to @xcite and to the references therein .",
    "let us consider the transcendental equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xmath4 stand for the modified bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "recently , bertini , giacomin and pakdaman @xcite in order to prove their main result about the spectrum of a self - adjoint linear operator , presented the inequalities @xmath7 the clever proof of the left - hand side of was based on the well - known turn type inequality @xmath8 in what follows we would like to show that in fact the right - hand side of is also equivalent to a turn type inequality involving modified bessel functions of the first kind . to proceed , we use the same notation as in @xcite . to prove the right - hand side of we need to show that @xmath9 that is , for @xmath10 we have @xmath11 now , by applying the identity ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.6 ) @xmath12 we obtain @xmath13 which implies that is equivalent to @xmath14 which by means of the recurrence relation @xmath15 is equivalent to the turn type inequality @xmath16 but , in view of the well - known soni inequality @xmath17 the above turn type inequality is a consequence of the stronger inequality ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.5 ) @xmath18 since all of the above inequalities are valid for @xmath10 it follows that the right - hand side of is valid",
    ".      recently , sonnenschein and schimansky - geier @xcite proposed ( without proof ) an improvement of the right - hand side of as follows @xmath19{1-\\frac{1}{k}}.\\ ] ] in the sequel we present a proof of , which is based also on a turn type inequality .",
    "note that to prove we need to show that @xmath20 that is , for @xmath10 we have @xmath21 now , by applying the identity we obtain @xmath22 which implies that is equivalent to @xmath23 which by means of the recurrence relation is equivalent to the turn type inequality @xmath24 since all of the above inequalities are valid for @xmath10 it follows that indeed the right - hand side of is valid .",
    "the turn type inequality is the limiting case of the next turn type inequality ( see @xcite ) when @xmath25 @xmath26 and it was shown by idier and collewet @xcite that we can take the limit and the inequality remains true .",
    "it is important to mention here that the powers in the left - hand side of the inequality , and in , that is @xmath27{1-\\frac{1}{k}},\\ ] ] are the best possible . to show this observe that the inequality is equivalent to @xmath28 here we used the inequality @xmath17 where @xmath29 which shows that @xmath30 maps @xmath31 into @xmath32 and thus @xmath33 for @xmath34 now we show that in the above inequalities the constants @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the best possible in the sense that the inequality @xmath37 is valid for all @xmath10 with the optimal parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 this implies that in the powers @xmath40 and @xmath41 are indeed the best possible .",
    "thus , let @xmath42 we prove that @xmath43 because of the presence of the logarithm , @xmath44 has no taylor series around @xmath45 , but it still can be expanded as follows @xmath46 from where the above limit immediately comes , as we stated . note",
    "that by using the mittag - leffler expansion of @xmath47 it is also possible to obtain the above limit .",
    "namely , since @xmath48 where @xmath49 stands for the @xmath50th positive zero of the bessel function @xmath51 by using the bernoulli - lhospital s rule twice we obtain that @xmath52    now , we are going to prove that the best constant @xmath53 equals to @xmath54 the well known asymptotic estimation @xmath55 yields that as @xmath56 grows @xmath57 substituting this into the definition of @xmath44 we can see that asymptotically it equals to @xmath58 the differences of logarithms both in the nominator and denominator can be expanded at infinity by the expansion @xmath59 what we get is the following @xmath60 for large @xmath56 , from which the result follows .",
    "let us consider the function @xmath61 defined by @xmath62 where @xmath63 stands for the modified bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath64 we are going to show that it is possible to extend the right - hand side of to the general case .",
    "thus , we consider the transcendental equation @xmath65 and we show that the next inequality holds true for all @xmath66 @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xmath69 however , we first show that if @xmath70 and @xmath66 then the equation @xmath71 has a positive real solution .",
    "observe that our equation has a trivial solution at @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , the function @xmath73 tends to infinity as @xmath74 grows .",
    "hence , if the tangent of the continuous function @xmath73 is negative at the origin then surely has a positive real solution .",
    "the derivative is as follows @xmath75 we need to take the limit when @xmath72 .",
    "this can be done by using the bernoulli - lhospital s rule .",
    "it comes after some simplification that @xmath76 from where it follows that in the case when @xmath77 then has a positive real solution .",
    "now , to prove the inequality we need to show that @xmath78 that is , for @xmath10 we have @xmath79 by applying the identity @xmath80 we obtain @xmath81 which implies that is equivalent to @xmath82 which by means of the recurrence relation @xmath83 is equivalent to the turn type inequality @xmath84 but , in view of the well - known soni inequality @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath29 the above turn type inequality is a consequence of the stronger inequality ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.5 ) @xmath87 which holds for @xmath88 and @xmath34 since all of the above inequalities are valid for @xmath10 and @xmath89 it follows that indeed the inequality is valid .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that the left - hand side of can be also extended to the general case when @xmath90 and the resulting inequality is reversed ( comparative to the left - hand side of ) and improves the inequality . to show the inequality @xmath91",
    "it is enough to show that for @xmath10 we have @xmath92 by using the above steps in view of we obtain that @xmath93 which implies that is equivalent to @xmath94 which by means of the recurrence relation is equivalent to the turn type inequality @xmath95 but , in view of the above soni inequality the above turn type inequality is a consequence of the stronger inequality when @xmath96    numerical experiments suggest that when @xmath97 the equation @xmath98 has a solution which depends on @xmath64 since is equivalent to , this implies that is not true for all @xmath66 @xmath97 and @xmath99      let us consider the extension of @xmath100 that is , @xmath101 we are going to prove that the best constant @xmath102 for which @xmath103 for @xmath10 and @xmath89 equals to @xmath104 in particular , @xmath105 the steps are the same as in the special case above when @xmath106 the asymptotic estimation yields that as @xmath56 grows @xmath107 substituting this into the definition of @xmath108 we can see that asymptotically it equals to @xmath109 and consequently @xmath110 for large @xmath56 , from which the result follows .",
    "the above discussion actually shows that when @xmath111 the extension is far from being the best possible one .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) strongly suggest the validity of the above claim .",
    "it is also worth to mention that the inequality is actually equivalent to the turn type inequality @xmath121{\\left(\\frac{i_{\\nu+1}(x)}{i_{\\nu}(x)}\\right)^{4}}\\cdot\\frac{i_{\\nu}(x)}{i_{\\nu+2}(x)}<1+\\frac{2\\nu}{x}\\frac{i_{\\nu+1}(x)}{i_{\\nu+2}(x)},\\ ] ] where @xmath116 and @xmath34 this turn type inequality is new , and we believe , but were unable to prove that it is true also when @xmath130 and @xmath34 the case @xmath131 has been already considered in .      in this subsection",
    "our aim is to propose that it would be possible to extend the inequality in another way such that to keep the sharpness .",
    "we believe that if @xmath89 @xmath129 and @xmath132 then we have @xmath133{\\left(1-\\frac{\\nu+1}{k}\\right)^{2\\nu+1}}.\\ ] ] it is important to mention here that by using the bernoulli inequality @xmath134 for @xmath135 and @xmath136 then clearly we have @xmath137{\\left(1-\\frac{\\nu+1}{k}\\right)^{2\\nu+1}}<\\sqrt[4]{\\left(1-\\frac{1}{k}\\right)^{2\\nu+1}},\\ ] ] or in other words the inequality improves .",
    "to prove we would need to show that @xmath138 by applying the identity [ quotgen ] and the recurrence relation [ recgen ] we obtain @xmath139 which implies that is equivalent to the turn type inequality @xmath140 which can be written as @xmath141 where @xmath10 and @xmath142 however , we were able to show the turn type inequality only for small values of @xmath143 all the same , we believe that is true for all @xmath10 and @xmath89 and this open problem may of interest for further research . using the recurrence relation @xmath144 and the amos bound @xmath145 where @xmath89 @xmath10 and @xcite @xmath146 we obtain that @xmath147 for @xmath148 and @xmath89 where @xmath149 is the unique positive root of the equation @xmath150    finally , we mention that the inequality is also sharp .",
    "namely , if we consider another extension of @xmath100 that is , @xmath151 then the best constant @xmath152 for which @xmath153 for @xmath10 and @xmath89 equals to @xmath154 in particular , @xmath155 the steps here are also the same as in the special case above when @xmath106 recall that the asymptotic estimation yields that as @xmath56 grows we have and substituting this into the definition of @xmath156 we can see that asymptotically it equals to @xmath157 and consequently @xmath158 for large @xmath56 , from which the result follows .",
    "in this section our aim is to propose two other approximations for the asymptotic order parameter of the stochastic kuramoto model .",
    "the first one is deduced by using the lagrange inversion theorem , and the second one is a rational approximation .",
    "we introduce the function @xmath161 defined by @xmath162 if @xmath163 , then there is only one non - negative real root of the equation @xmath164 and this is @xmath72 .",
    "but if @xmath165 , there is an additional , non - trivial solution for this transcendental equation which we denote by @xmath159 .",
    "recall the inequality and the fact that a sharper upper estimation is valid , see @xmath166{1-\\frac{1}{k}}.\\ ] ] thanks to the analyticity of @xmath167 in the neighbor of its root , one can use the lagrange inversion theorem in its simplest form to establish a better approximation to @xmath159 .",
    "this approximation for @xmath165 reads as @xmath168 where @xmath169{1-\\frac{1}{k}},\\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad s=2ka(k).\\ ] ] the above expression is nothing else but the zeroth order approximation plus the first order term in the inverse series of @xmath167 around the root estimation @xmath170 .",
    "the performance of this approximation is drawn on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . here",
    "the upper , blue plot belongs to the upper bound @xmath171{1-\\frac1k}$ ] , the bottom red plot belongs to the lower bound @xmath172 , the black one is the theoretical solution @xmath159 , while the grey plot is our approximation @xmath173 .",
    "one can see that for all @xmath165 the lagrange estimation approximates the theoretical @xmath159 best .",
    "numerical calculations show that if @xmath174 then @xmath173 already gives 6 digits accuracy . that @xmath173 is really better than @xmath170",
    "can easily be seen independently from the above graph .",
    "indeed , the series defined by the lagrange inversion theorem converges to the solution if the center is close enough to the theoretical solution .",
    "since we started the approximation from the point @xmath170 , this latter requirement satisfies , and @xmath170 is the zeroth order approximation .",
    "then one more term in the lagrange formula ( resulting @xmath173 ) gets even closer to @xmath159 .",
    "the advantage of @xmath170 is that it is algebraic .",
    "while @xmath173 approximates the theoretical solution better , it is transcendental since it contains transcendental functions . in this section",
    "we find an approximation which is not simply algebraic but _ rational_. we use the well known expansion ,",
    "that is , @xmath176 we truncate this at the `` @xmath177 '' term , and substitute it into .",
    "thus , we get a fraction in which the nominator and denominator are polynomials of @xmath178 and @xmath170 .",
    "since @xmath179 as @xmath178 grows , we simply write 1 in place of @xmath170 . after a simplification",
    "we get the following expression @xmath180    this is not , of course , better than @xmath173 . but @xmath181 offers a rather good rational approximation to @xmath159 comparable at least with @xmath170 .",
