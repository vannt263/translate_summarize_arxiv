    "there is currently great interest in the direct detection of extra - solar planets , brown dwarfs , and very low - mass stars .",
    "the study of such young , low - mass objects has been yielding increasingly fruitful science , yet the field remains dependent on evolutionary models to properly interpret the data that are collected from these objects .",
    "in particular , mass , while a fundamental property , is very rarely measured directly ( through orbital dynamics ) , and instead must be inferred from theoretical tracks ( e.g. , burrows , sudarsky , and lunine 2003 , chabrier et al . 2000 ) .",
    "it is thus of great interest to discover calibrating objects that can link a dynamically measured mass with observables such as accurate nir ( 1 - 2.5 @xmath8 m ) fluxes and spectral types .",
    "ab dor a was suspected of having a low - mass companion due to vlbi and hipparcos measurements of an astrometric wobble ( guirado et al .",
    "1997 ) . recently close et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , reported the first direct detection of this low - mass companion ( ab dor c ) to the young star ab dor a , along with the first measurements of the jhks fluxes , spectral type , and dynamically determined mass of ab dor c. upon comparing these results with the predictions of chabrier et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , they found the models to be systematically over - predicting the fluxes and temperature of ab dor c ( especially at j & h ) , given a system age of 50 myr .",
    "put another way , the model masses seem to be underestimating the mass of a low - mass object given its age , j & h nir fluxes , and spectral type .",
    "since the publication of these results , another calibrating object has been reported by reiners , basri , and mohanty ( 2005 ) : usco ctio 5 .",
    "while this equal - mass binary is younger ( @xmath98 myr ) and more massive ( total mass @xmath100.64 m@xmath11 ) than ab dor c , reiners et al . find the same trend of models under - predicting masses based simply on photometric and spectroscopic data applied to the hr diagram .",
    "a similar trend for such masses was previously noted by hillenbrand and white ( 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , this trend has been theoretically predicted for higher masses by mohanty , jayawardhana , and basri ( 2004 ) , and by marley et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for planetary masses .",
    "hence it is critically important to accurately calibrate the evolutionary tracks to determine if there are systematic errors . in particular , obtaining an accurate @xmath12 from spectra of low - mass , young , objects is challenging and makes comparison to evolutionary tracks difficult ( chabrier et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "recently nielsen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have obtained new orbital epochs and confirmed the previous mass of ab dor c of @xmath7 with the technique of guirado et al .",
    "hence ab dor c has a uniquely well known dynamical mass for a young ( @xmath13 myr ) low - mass object .",
    "only gl 569ba / bb has a similarly well determined mass but is thought to be somewhat older ( age @xmath9300 myr ; zapatero osorio et al .",
    "2005 ) , though a younger age ( @xmath14 myr ) and binarity of gl 569 ba has recently been proposed ( simon et al .",
    "2006 ) . also the lack of lithium in the spectrum of gl 569b ( zapatero osorio et al .",
    "2006 ) is surprising .",
    "hence , there is a need to quantify the ab dor a / c system as closely as possible to have an additional calibrator for low - mass young evolutionary models .",
    "the age of ab dor ( and its associated moving group ) is also somewhat uncertain , luhman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argue for an older age of the ab dor group of 75 - 150 myr while nielsen et al.(2005 ) find @xmath15 myr . recently",
    "lopez - santiago et al .",
    "( 2006 ) argue for a 50 myr age for the core of the ab dor moving group ( which includes ab dor a ) as did zuckerman et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in the original `` ab dor moving group '' paper .",
    "recently janson et al . ( 2007 ) find an age range of 50 - 100 myr . here",
    "we adopt an `` average '' age of 75 myr for the system .",
    "there is also uncertainty in the spectral type of ab dor c. the small separation between a & c of only @xmath16 combined with the @xmath17 contrast made an accurate spectral type difficult to measure in the dataset of close et al .",
    "a reanalysis of the close et al .",
    "spectra by nielsen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggested a spectral type of @xmath18 .",
    "however , an independent re - analysis of these data by luhman & potter ( 2005 ) suggested a spectral type of @xmath19 .",
    "the importance of this temperature is paramount to plotting ab dor c on the hr diagram to calibrate the accuracy of the evolutionary tracks .",
    "these past papers highlight the difficulty in trying to determine the spectral type of a faint companion within @xmath20 of a bright star with an ao - fed long - slit spectrograph .",
    "indeed none of these past reductions of the ao long - slit spectra were able to preserve the continuum of ab dor c. hence the true spectrum of c could not be accurately determined until now .    in the companion paper to this one ( thatte et al .",
    "2007 ; hereafter paper i ) we report on new , excellent integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) of ab dor a & c , observed with the sinfoni instrument at the vlt . using the new data analysis technique of psf scaling and differencing ( psd ) , we were able to effectively eliminate all contamination from ab dor a , to produce a very high signal - to - noise spectrum of ab dor c , which also preserves the continuum .",
    "the psd technique is able to achieve very high contrast ( @xmath99 mags at 02 ) without a coronagraph , and without any prior assumptions about the spectral characteristics of the companion object ( see paper 1 for more inforamtion about the ifs reduction , and the psd technique ) .    in this paper we present new vlt science archive ks photometry and astrometry for ab dor c and a more accurate h & k spectrum and a new temperature of ab dor c. then we compare the accuracy of the mass of ab dor c predicted by the popular dusty theoretical tracks ( chabrier et al .",
    "the ab dor system ( a , c , and their companion babb  @xmath21 distant ) was observed with the vlt naco ao system ( lenzen et al .",
    "2003 ; rousset et al . 2002 ) on jan 7 , 2005 by r. neuhauser et al . in the ks band .",
    "we have reduced these archive data with our nir ao data reduction iraf pipeline ( close et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "the ks images were fully flat - fielded , sky & dark subtracted , bad pixel cleaned , and aligned and medianed ( see close et al .",
    "2003 for more details about our ao pipeline ) .",
    "only the first 18 200x0.347 second ks images were reduced since the seeing became worse after these first 18 images .",
    "we also observed ab dor a & c with the sinfoni ifs as described in paper i. see paper i for extensive details of the ifs observations & reductions .",
    "to accurately measure the flux of a tight faint companion is never trivial .",
    "however , by january 2005 ab dor c had moved out to a @xmath22 separation from ab dor a. while this may seem a very small separation it is considerably better than the @xmath16 separation during the feb 2004 discovery images of close et al .",
    "hence , we should be able to better gauge the flux of ab dor c at this latter epoch .    to measure the brightness of ab dor c we utilized the unsaturated psf image ( in the narrow band 2.12 micron filter ) of ab dor a which was taken just before the ab dor ks data set .",
    "this 2.12 @xmath23 `` psf '' image was taken at the same airmass and seeing as the ks images .",
    "also , the exposure times were the same ( dit=0.347 seconds , ndit=200 coadds ) for the psf and ks images .",
    "the fwhm of the psf appeared similar to that of ab dor c. so we have some confidence that this was a good psf .",
    "we shifted ( with a cubic spline ) and scaled this psf image until subtracting it led to the flux from c being completely removed from the reduced ks images .",
    "however , as is clear from figure 1 , there is some residual flux or `` super - speckles '' surrounding c s position from a. therefore , it is impossible to absolutely determine the flux of c due to some uncertainty in a s psf .",
    "we adopt the mean flux of ab dor c as that where the residual flux of a at the position of c is equal to that 180 degrees on the other side of the a psf ( see bottom left image in figure 1 ) .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since the super speckles in the naco psf are mainly due to phase errors which transform to symmetric pairs on either side of the psf .",
    "here we have made the conservative assumption that the possible range of c s flux should be from completely removing all residual flux at the position of c ( fig 1 : lower right ) to assuming there is a slightly brighter super - speckle at c s position ( fig 1 ; upper right ) .",
    "the ks flux of ab dor b is known from the 2mass catalog to be @xmath24 ( corrected for the 0.095 mag of contamination of b due to a in the 2mass @xmath25 aperture photometry ) .",
    "hence by calibrating the mean delta ks of the psf to babb ( which varied by @xmath26% over a range of 1.5,2.0 , & 2.5@xmath27 apertures ) we derive a @xmath28 mag for c. this flux is derived assuming a symmetric psf while the large errorbars are derived assuming minimal symmetry in the ab dor a psf and adding in the maximum errors of the aperture photometry ( see the top right and bottom right images in figure 1 ) .",
    "hence , the true flux of ab dor c should certainly fall inside this range .",
    "our new value of @xmath28 is very similar to the @xmath29 mag measured by close et al .",
    "our conservative assumption of minimal psf symmetry around ab dor a leads to our photometric errors being larger than those of close et al . who assumed the psf was mainly symmetric .",
    "our new photometry is also consistent ( if a bit brighter and more precise ) than the @xmath30 mag independently determined by luhman & potter ( 2005 ) from the close et al.(2005 ) dataset .",
    "moreover , we obtain a @xmath31 mag from the ifs data - cube in paper 1  adding further confidence to our ks band flux of c. hence , there is now reasonable agreement from three different epochs that @xmath32 for ab dor c.    from the hipparcos distance of @xmath33 pc and the @xmath34 mag @xmath35 of allen et al .",
    "( 2003)(appropriate for m5.5 ) and noting that for an m5.5 @xmath36 mag ( daemgen et al 2006 ) we derive a luminosity of @xmath4 from the observed @xmath28 mag of ab dor c.      from our psf fitting ab dor c is found to be @xmath37 at @xmath38 in good agreement with the orbit of nielsen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) which predicts a separation of @xmath39 at @xmath40 for jan 7 , 2005 ( 2005.0170 ) .",
    "this good agreement gives us further confidence in the orbital solution of nielsen et al .",
    "moreover , we have another ( even later ) jan 24 2006 ( 2006.0660 ) epoch of observation from the ifs dataset of paper i ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this additional data - point also fits the orbital solution of nielsen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) very well .",
    "figures 2 & 3 illustrate the quality of the orbital solution of nielsen et al .",
    "note that this orbit was mainly determined by the reflex motion of a from @xmath41 mas hipparcos / vlbi astrometry of guirado et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ( for clarity these hipparcos / vlbi data - points are not shown in figure 2 ) .",

    "we were also able to study the companion binary babb ( a tight @xmath42 , @xmath43 binary discovered by close et al .",
    "2005 ) some @xmath44 away is visible in the reduced image . on jan 7 , 2005",

    "i an excellent r@xmath91500 h and ks spectrum of ab dor c was obtained with the sinfoni ifs . here",
    "we attempt to place our spectrum on a spectral sequence .",
    "unfortunately there simply are no good h & k template spectra for late m stars of @xmath975 myr of age .",
    "hence , we have endeavored to fit our spectrum to young ( @xmath9 1 myr ; gorlova et al . 2003 ) and old field m stars ( cushing et al .",
    "as is clear from figures 4 - 7 there is pretty good agreement that the spectrum is similar to m5 or a m6 .",
    "we feel the spectra presented here are superior to those previously published by close et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; nielsen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; and luhman & potter ( 2006 ) for several reasons .",
    "all previous published spectra were different reductions of the long - slit naco k spectra obtained by close et al .",
    "these ao - fed long slit spectra suffered from many of the drawbacks of ao - fed long - slit spectra .",
    "first , the very small @xmath50 slit used in the older spectra was only roughly aligned with the binary , due to flexure etc .",
    "hence , there are different slit losses for each spectrum obtained as ab dor was nodded along the slit . moreover , as the core fwhm of the ao psf decreases as @xmath51 increases , hence slit losses are also function of the wavelength as well as the centering error .",
    "finally there may have been some error in the pa angle of the slit and so there may be different slit losses between ab dor a and c. also the very small separation of @xmath52 between a & c made these spectra very difficult to reduce ( in fact many of the individual spectra had to be dropped from the reduction since no manner of subtracting a could reveal a non - noise signal at the position of c ) . indeed , luhman & potter ( 2006 ) and nielsen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) only use @xmath9 50% of the spectra obtained to try and detect a signal from c. in all these previous spectra the flux from ab dor a swamped the light from c ( just 0.15away ) ; this is not surprising given the @xmath53 images obtained with the naco spectrograph that night . in the end , none of the three previous efforts at reducing this close et al . (",
    "2005 ) spectral dataset could obtain any meaningful k continuum of ab dor c ( and no h band spectra was attempted ) .",
    "so all these past efforts simply fit the `` continuum '' with a polynomial and attempted to remove as much of it as possible ( in close et al .",
    "2005 the continuum was restored with a standard ) . therefore , no spectrum of ab dor c with the original continuum intact have been published to date .    without continua",
    "it is very hard to be sure that one is not either over or undersubtracting a from c. hence , strengths of the co and na absorption lines are somewhat suspect and uncertain .",
    "this explains , in part , the significant dispersion in the spectral types determined from the three different reductions of the rather poor quality ao long slit spectra .",
    "to better understand what the real spectral type of ab dor c is we have approached this problem with a new ( more advanced ) technique of psd ifs reduction .",
    "our ifs spectrum in this paper is superior for several reasons .",
    "one is that c was a more favorable @xmath54 away from a at the time of the ifs observation .",
    "another is that use of the ifs allowed significantly better removal of the contaminating psf wing of a ( at every wavelength ) of the ifs datacube by psf subtraction ( see paper 1 for full details ) .",
    "moreover , we could easily check in each ifs `` image '' of how well we had removed the wing of a from the position of c ( this is nearly impossible to do with long slit spectra ) .",
    "also , by effectively integrating longer we were able to obtain s / n@xmath940 .",
    "in addition , we have obtained h band as well as k band spectra .",
    "increasing the spectral range through h helps determine a more accurate spectral type .",
    "finally , use of the the ifs eliminates slit losses , and has allowed us to produce excellent spectra of ab dor c in the h and k bands with a stable continuum across both bands . to highlight the improvement we directly compare our new spectra with that of nielsen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in figure 2 of paper 1 .",
    "we believe that the points raised above make clear why our h & k ifs continuum - preserved spectrum is superior to previously published ( non - continuum preserved ) k spectra of ab dor c. however , it is still difficult obtaining a perfect spectral type fit for ab dor c since it has an age ( and so surface gravity ) different from that of published m standards .",
    "for example , in fig 5 it is clear that m4 is not the correct spectral type since the na lines of gl 213 fit the ab dor c spectra too well  and since ab dor c is younger than gl 213 it should have _ weaker _ na i lines than a field dwarf of the same spectral type ( see gorlova et al .",
    "2004 for example ) .",
    "in fact , the m5 field dwarf gl 51 fits the co lines the best ( including an exceptionally good fit to the pseudo - continuum past 2.3 microns ) . since co is not strongly gravity dependent ( gorlova et al .",
    "2004 ) there is evidence that the temperature of ab dor c must be close to that of gl 51 ( m5 ) .",
    "spectra presented in previous studies all likely had too much strength in the na i line compared to co ( which is unlikely for a low surface gravity object ) .",
    "in this study it is now clear that in the k band data ab dor c appears as a low surface gravity m5 ( fitting the co well but weaker in the na i lines ) .",
    "moreover , our k - band continuum follows that of gl 51 ( m5 ) or gl 406 equally well , yet that of an m4 ( too hot ) or m7 ( too cold ) can be excluded at @xmath55 of our estimated noise level ( see our @xmath56 errorbars in figures 5 & 6 ) .",
    "hence , there is excellent evidence from fig 5 that the spectral type of c must be in the range of m5-m6 .",
    "further evidence comes from fig 6 ( our h band spectra ) . here",
    "we see the mg & al lines between 1.65 - 1.75 microns of the m3 & m4 dwarfs are not seen in the cooler ab dor c atmosphere . moreover , ab dor c s continuum shape is nicely matched by the m5 and m6 templates from 1.58 - 1.8 microns . whereas the bluest part of h has the lowest strehl and likely some slight contamination from the hotter a component  heating up our continuum slightly at the bluest part of h band .",
    "the m7 continuum appears too cool .",
    "hence , we see in the h band the best fit is to a m5-m6 spectral type .",
    "therefore , we determine that the gravity independent line strengths ( like co ) and the continuum of ab dor c are best fit by field m5-m6 dwarfs . in summary",
    ", we conservatively estimate a spectral type of m@xmath0 for ab dor c.    our new spectral type of m@xmath0 for ab dor c is considerably earlier than the m@xmath1 measured in close et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and nielsen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) yet is consistent with the m@xmath2 independently derived by luhman & potter ( 2005 ) . in summary ,",
    "our continuum is preserved and the s / n ( @xmath57 ) , wavelength range , and resolutions ( @xmath91500 ) are all much higher , hence the spectrum presented here is a significant improvement over any previous spectrum of ab dor c.    using the dwarf temperature scale of leggett et al .",
    "( 1996 ) we find a temperate range of @xmath58 k for ab dor c. however , this error does not take into account a possible @xmath59k systematic error in this popular temperature scale .",
    "hence the final total errors could be as high as @xmath60 k.",
    "in figure 7 we compare our observed values to those predicted by the cooling curves of the dusty models .",
    "note how the j and h values appear to be fainter than the models would predict ( assuming a 75 myr age for ab dor ; nielsen et al 2005 ) , this result is similar to that of close et al .",
    "yet there is good agreement with the ks ( as was also the case in close et al .",
    "2005 ) . moreover , our higher @xmath12 is in better agreement with the cooling curves than in close et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the j - ks for ab dor c is @xmath61 which is surprisingly red for m5.5 object ( which are typically closer to @xmath62 in the pleiades ) .",
    "hence , it is possible that the j band flux measured by close et al .",
    "( @xmath63 ) or luhman & potter ( @xmath64 ) may be systematically too faint .",
    "we caution that it is problematic to obtain high - quality high - contrast images in the j band with ao and so , in general , weight should not be placed on j band fluxes of faint companions since lower strehls lead to a higher chance of a poor flux calibration . in any case , the mean j flux of close et al .",
    "( 2005 ) would only have to be brightened by @xmath65 mag to give consistent colors with m5.5 pleiades objects .",
    "this would lead to slightly better agreement with the models especially at the oldest ages suggested for ab dor of 75 - 150 myr by luhman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ) .    as is mentioned in luhman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) a good technique for indirectly determining the mass of an object is to place the object in the hr diagram and from the evolutionary tracks estimate a mass . in figure 8",
    "we show how the new spectral type of m5.5 is in good agreement with the dusty tracks in the hr diagram for a @xmath66 object like ab dor c. hence , the combination of a careful measurement of the ks flux and spectral type can allow the mass of a young low - mass object like ab dor c to be estimated from the dusty tracks .",
    "however , underestimates of the mass can occur without proper ( continuum preserved ) spectra or relying on just h and j fluxes alone .",
    "the points with error bars in figure 8 mark all low - mass young objects with well determined dynamical masses .",
    "the thick diagonal lines represent the rough disagreement between the measured luminosity and temperature to the values actually predicted by the dusty models for the true mass of the object .",
    "one can see that for ab dor c and and the older ( @xmath9300 myr ) gl 569 b system ( zapatero osorio et al .",
    "2004 ) , the offset between observation and the tracks are within the 1@xmath67 uncertainties ( especially considering the uncertainty in the ages for these systems ) .",
    "however , in the recently discovered eclipsing binary 2mass j05352184 - 0546085 ( stassun et al .",
    "2006 ) in the orion trapezium star formation region ( @xmath68 myr age ) the 0.034@xmath69 secondary is _",
    "hotter _ than the @xmath70 m6.5 primary .",
    "hence , there is an increase in uncertainty in the models for very young ( @xmath71 myr ) low - mass ( @xmath72 ) objects .",
    "however , the derived mass for 2m0535a would only be low by @xmath73% ( just consistant with the 1 myr track ) , whereas the derived mass for 2m0535b from the 1 myr track would be about 200% too high ( a similar trend was predicted by mohanty et al .",
