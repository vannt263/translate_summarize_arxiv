    "progress made in trapping ultracold atomic gases into different low - dimensional systems  @xcite has provided us grounds to describe and simulate the behavior of fascinating non - fermi liquid in which the analysis may not be as tractable .",
    "the physical properties of such systems have attracted both experimental and theoretical interest .    for the research in the experimental side , the tonks - girardeau regime of strongly repulsive bosons in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems has been observed  @xcite .",
    "this regime is understood through the mapping of the strongly repulsive , impenetrable bosons onto an ideal gas of fermions subjected to the same external potential  @xcite .",
    "esslinger and colleagues at eth zurich in switzerland confined a two - component fermi gas of @xmath0k atoms to thousands of highly elongated one - dimensional tubes .",
    "such a system is realized by using a two - dimensional optical lattice , having about 100 atoms in each tube  @xcite and serves as a 1d matter waveguide to observe the two - particle bound states of atoms .",
    "for the first time , they created confinement induced molecules .",
    "the binding energy of the molecules is measured by using radio - frequency spectroscopy bearing a good agreement with the theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "importantly , two - particle bound molecular states are formed in 1d confined system independent of the nature of the interaction , i.e. , attractive or repulsive between atoms .",
    "this is obviously different from what happens in free space where a molecule is formed only when the atoms attract .    on the other hand , many theoretical efforts on quasi - one dimensional ( q1d ) inhomogeneous fermi gases have been made . for 1d trapped fermions at finite temperature with attractive binary interactions ,",
    "the transition to a fermion - paired state is obtained by exact stochastic mean - field calculations  @xcite , which is characterized by dominant cooper pairing correlations , an algebraic long - range order and a superfluid component .",
    "a one - dimensional spin - polarized fermi gas with infinitely strong attractive zero - range odd - wave interactions has been studied .",
    "this system is known as the fermionic tonks - girardeau gas , arising from a confinement - induced resonance reachable via a three - dimensional p - wave feshbach resonance  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a bosonization technique has been developed to calculate analytically the density profile , the momentum distribution , and several correlation functions of two - component fermi gases with inclusion of forward - scattering processes and exclusion of backward scattering between inter - components .",
    "inhomogeneous tomonaga - luttinger liquid model , with space - dependent parameters assuming a slowly varying trap potential on the scale of the fermi wavelength , has been used to describe spin - charge separation in two - component fermi gases  @xcite .",
    "the thomas - fermi approximation is widely used to calculate the ground state properties of a large system  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a molecular tonks - girardeau gas is predicted for strong attractive effective interactions  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a microscopic calculation of the density - functional theory ( dft ) , based on the exact bethe - ansatz solution of 1d homogeneous gaudin - yang system , is presented for the ground - state density profile with arbitrary size .",
    "quantitative understanding about the role of the repulsive or attractive interactions on the shell structure of the axial density profile is achieved .    above mentioned studies",
    "are focused on the fully polarized fermi atomic gases .",
    "recently , progress in two experiments  @xcite in trapping partially polarized fermi atomic gases has paved the way for systematic studies on systems with different number of spin - up and spin - down atoms ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the experiment explored on three - dimensional polarized @xmath2li gases  @xcite suggested that the density profiles show coexisting three - shell structures : a fully unpolarized paired superfluid phase in the center of the trap , a fully polarized noninteracting phase composed of excess atoms , and a partially polarized normal shell between these two regions .",
    "the experiment which employed an elongated cigar - shaped trap of polarized @xmath2li gases  @xcite suggests the gas separates into a phase that is consistent with a superfluid paired core surrounded by a shell of normal unpaired fermions beyond a critical polarization .",
    "recently two theoretical investigations  @xcite discussed partially polarized two - component fermi gases of attractive interaction within local density approximation while implementing the exact exchange - correlation interaction from the homogeneous bethe - ansatz solution of 1d gaudin - yang model .",
    "both of these two papers predict a two - shell density profile structure of a coexisting partially polarized superfluid core in the center of the trap while at the edges of the trap either fully paired or fully polarized wings depending on the attractive interaction strength and the polarization .",
    "furthermore , they anticipated a critical spin polarization and a non - monotonic behavior of the thomas - fermi radius of each spin component as a function of the polarization .",
    "orso  @xcite and hu et al .",
    "@xcite identified the polarized superfluid as having the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) structure , which is stabilized in a polarized two - component fermi gas in an array of weakly - coupled 1d tubes  @xcite .",
    "these two theoretical efforts used the local - density approximation for the harmonic trap and thomas - fermi - type approximation for the interaction .",
    "the local - density approximation is applicable when @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of particles , but deteriorates with decreasing particle number and completely neglects the tunneling of the density profile beyond the thomas - fermi radius where one instead needs to use a method beyond the local - density approximation , like the microscopic density - functional theory .",
    "the fflo phenomena of imbalanced fermion populations in 1d optical lattices of attractive interactions have also been extensively discussed recently  @xcite , where fflo pairing is formed robust from the attractive interaction for a wide range of polarization , and for the spatial inhomogeneities induced by the presence of a trap in the experimental reality .    in this paper , we study 1d harmonically trapped fermi gases of imbalanced spin population with two alternative approaches .",
    "one is the spin - density - functional theory based on the bethe - ansatz results for the 1d luttinger liquid , which is specially useful for systems whose analytical solutions or exact numerical methods are not available , and the other is the thomas - fermi approximation based on the non - interacting approximation for the kinetic energy .",
    "both methods consider exactly the exchange - correlation energy of the corresponding 1d homogeneous system . within these two methods ,",
    "we quantitatively study the systems of weak and intermediate coupling strength and different polarizations by analyzing the charge and spin density profiles .",

    "the different phases in the two - shell structure of standard bcs state outside of the center and the fflo - type state in the bulk , are proofed to be a smooth second - order transformation  @xcite . in all the above calculations with weak and intermediate coupling regimes , we find the tfa results give a good overall shape to the microscopic calculations based on the balsda .",
    "but importantly , the tfa could not produce oscillation structure due to correlation effects in the quantum system .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented two alternative methods to study the imbalanced two - component fermi atomic gases of attractive interactions in q1d harmonic traps .",
    "one is the spin - density - functional theory based on bethe - ansatz solutions , which properly incorporates the luther - emery nature and the spin energy gap of the homogeneous system .",
    "another is the tfa which takes a local density approximation for the noninteracting kinetic energy but including the exchange - correlation energy .",
    "we apply these two methods to the system of finite size trapped by the harmonic confinement . at weak coupling strength of any polarization or intermediate coupling of large polarization , a two - shell structure",
    "is obtained with a partially polarized pairs of fflo - type state in the core and a fully polarized fermions in the wings . at intermediate coupling regime of small polarization ,",
    "a two - shell structure is formed of partially polarized pairs of fflo - type state in the bulk and a fully paired bcs state at the edges which is different from the 3d case . in the current experimental set - up",
    ", imbalanced interacting fermi gases can be induced by a radio - frequency sweep in the optical lattice system , and in the on - going experiments , the two - shell structure described here should be observable in the system of thousands of q1d tubes formed in the quasi - two - dimensional optical lattices with each of the tube containing up to 100 atoms measured by absorption imaging techniques , while the direct test of fflo states remains as a challenge to experimental community  @xcite .",
    "it would be of interest to develop the present scheme to study dynamical phenomena in these strongly correlated gases using time - dependent dft and/or current - dft , instead of resorting to the inhomogeneous tomonaga - luttinger liquid model . from a more formal dft viewpoint , a functional better than the one presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq : balda ] ) is desirable and necessary to deal with the strong coupling regime .",
