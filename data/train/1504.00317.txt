    "understanding the production mechanism of low-@xmath0 quarkonia in nucleon - nucleon collisions is of fundamental importance to properly use them as probes of deconfinement or collectivity in heavy ion collisions . indeed , most of the analysis of quarkonium production in nucleus - nucleus collisions are carried out on the bulk of the cross section , namely at low @xmath0 .",
    "recently , comparisons between alice data  @xcite without @xmath0 cut and cms data  @xcite with @xmath0 cut in pbpb collisions at @xmath8 tev showed an unexpected suppression pattern of the charmonia , at variance with the simple picture of quarkonium melting in deconfined quark matter  @xcite . however ,",
    "to properly interpret this observation , it is essential to rule out the possibility that a part of the effect observed could be due to a difference in the production mechanism in individual nucleon - nucleon collisions at low and at larger @xmath0 .",
    "the propagation of a colour - octet pair in a deconfined medium certainly differs from that of a colour - singlet pair ; this can result into a different nuclear suppression ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . on the contrary , as regards the bottomonia , the observation of the expected sequential - suppression pattern has been claimed by cms  @xcite .",
    "further , the effect of normal nuclear matter may also significantly depend on how the pair is produced : the recently revived fractional energy loss  @xcite would for instance act on long - lived colour - octet states and probably differently if the heavy quark state is already produced colourless at short distance , as postulated in the csm  @xcite .",
    "saturation effects in @xmath9 collisions also do depend on the colour state of the perturbatively produced heavy - quark pair  @xcite    despite the possibility that nrqcd factorisation would not hold at low @xmath0 , several nrqcd analyses have thus been carried earlier to evaluate the impact of the colour - octet channels to the @xmath0-integrated @xmath3 yields  @xcite . a first study of the impact of initial state radiations ( isr ) on the very low @xmath0 @xmath3 s and @xmath10 s was recently carried out successfully in nrqcd  @xcite  yet at the cost of introducing additional non - perturbative parameters .",
    "whereas , based on an analysis of the sole early rhic data , cooper  _ et al .",
    "_  argued  @xcite that the universality of nrqcd was safe and that colour - singlet contributions to the @xmath0-integrated @xmath3 yields were negligible , the global analysis of maltoni  _ et al . _",
    "at nlo showed  @xcite that the colour - octet long - distance matrix elements ( ldmes ) required to describe the total prompt @xmath3 yield from fixed - target energies to rhic were _",
    "one tenth _ of that expected from the  leading - order fit of the @xmath0-differential cross sections at tevatron energies .",
    "such fits of the @xmath0-differential @xmath3 cross sections have recently been extended to nlo _i.e . _  one - loop accuracy on the prompt @xmath3 yields some of them focusing on the larger @xmath0 data and explicitly including the feed - down contributions  @xcite , some enlarging the analysis beyond hadroproduction and including rather low-@xmath0 data  @xcite and on the @xmath11 yields  @xcite .",
    "thanks to these studies , we can significantly extend the existing nrqcd studies of the @xmath0-integrated cross section by combining in a coherent manner , the hard parts  or wilson coefficients up to @xmath2 , first derived by  @xcite and which we have systematically checked with fdc  @xcite , with the nrqcd matrix elements fitted at nlo on the @xmath0 dependence of the yields .",
    "one can indeed consider the _ @xmath0-integrated _ and the _ @xmath0-differential _ cross sections as two different observables  their born contributions involve different diagrams  and such a procedure is not a all trivial physics - wise .",
    "as we detail later , our results show that the data do not allow for a global description of both the @xmath0-integrated and @xmath0-differential quarkonium yields .",
    "as a point of comparison , we also had a look at colour - evaporation - model - like ( cem ) predictions derived from nrqcd following the work of  @xcite and we found out that it can not reproduce @xmath0-integrated yields using the ldmes obtained following the relations of  @xcite after identifying the minimal singlet transition to that of the csm . _ a contrario _ , results obtained from the traditional cem implementation at one loop do not show a similar issue .",
    "the inability of colour - octet dominance within nrqcd to provide a global description of both low and large @xmath0 data is in line with the recent findings  @xcite that the sole lo colour - singlet contributions are sufficient to account for the magnitude of the total cross section and its dependence in rapidity , @xmath12 , from rhic , tevatron all the way to lhc energies .",
    "any additional contribution in this energy range creates a surplus as compared to data .",
    "however , as we also study in a dedicated section , the total nlo csm cross section shows a weird energy dependence at lhc energies .",
    "the problem is striking for the @xmath3 , less for the @xmath10 . in any case",
    ", one should be very careful in interpreting these results .",
    "in particular , such nlo results can not be considered as a improvement of the lo ones .",
    "we also observe the same issue for @xmath13 and @xmath14 production for which there is no final - state - gluon radiation at born order .",
    "we are therefore tempted to attribute this behaviour to large loop contributions which become negative at low @xmath0 , rather than to specific effects related to the @xmath15 production _ per se_. a quick inspection of the rather concise one - loop results  @xcite for @xmath13 and @xmath14 production in the tmd factorisation formalism",
    "unfortunately does not reveal any obvious negative contributions and does not help in the understanding of this rather general issue of quarkonium production in collinear factorisation .",
    "the same problems appear with some co channels as well and may therefore cast doubts on the reliability of our results in the @xmath16 region where some contributions shows a strange behaviour in particular at lhc energies . at this stage , we are not able to conclude from our observations whether these problems are indicative of the break down of nrqcd factorisation at low @xmath0 and low @xmath17 or at low @xmath17 only . however , for sure , none of the above observations can reasonably support the idea that co transitions are dominant at low @xmath0 .",
    "such a conclusion would be for the least premature .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : x - section ] , we detail the procedure to evaluate the @xmath0-integrated yield at one - loop accuracy in nrqcd and we explain the idea underlying this first complete one - loop analysis . in section  [ sec : ldmes ] , we explain our selection of ldmes determined at nlo . in section  [ sec : data ] , we briefly comment on the existing world data sets for @xmath3 , @xmath18 and @xmath5 analysis of gong _ et al . _",
    "@xcite treats the @xmath5 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the lack of knowledge on the @xmath21 and @xmath22 yields and their corresponding feed down to @xmath19 and @xmath20 makes the analysis of their _ direct _ yield delicate ; we have thus decided not to consider these in the present study . our choice has been confirmed by the recent lhcb result  @xcite that a large fraction of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 yield actually comes from @xmath21 and @xmath22 decays  up to 40% in the @xmath20 case . ] .",
    "we also explain how we estimate the direct yields . in section  [ sec :",
    "results_nrqcd ] , we show and discuss our results for the first full one - loop nrqcd analysis of quarkonium hadroproduction . to go further in the interpretation of some of our results , we discuss in section  [ sec : results_cem ] the prediction of nrqcd using cem - like ldmes .",
    "this is also compared with the conventional approach based on quark - hadron duality .",
    "section  [ sec : results_csm ] focuses on csm results both for the @xmath15 states considered here and for the @xmath23 states for which analytical results exist .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "following the nrqcd factorisation , the cross - section for quarkonium hadroproduction can be expressed from the parton densities in the colliding hadrons , @xmath24 , a hard - part the partonic cross section for the production of a heavy - quark pair with zero relative velocity , @xmath25 , in a definite angular - momentum , spin and colour state , and a ldme connected to the hadronisation probabilities of the intermediate state into the quarkonium .",
    "namely , one has for the production of a quarkonium @xmath26 along with some unidentified set of particles @xmath27 , @xmath28\\langle{\\cal o}_{{{\\cal q}}}(n)\\rangle \\label{sum - section } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the indices @xmath29 run over all partonic species and @xmath30 denotes the colour , spin and angular momentum states of the intermediate @xmath31 pair .    for the @xmath15 quarkonium states , the first co states which appear in the @xmath25 expansion are the @xmath32}_{0},^{3}s^{[8]}_{1}$ ] and @xmath33}_{j}$ ] states , in addition to the leading @xmath25 contribution @xmath34}_{1}$ ] from a cs transition .",
    "one however has to note that , for hadroproduction , whereas the co contributions already appear at @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ diagram - a ] & [ diagram - b ] ) , the cs one only appear at @xmath2 ( fig .  [ diagram - c ] ) .",
    "these @xmath35 co graphs nevertheless do not contribute to the production of quarkonia with a _",
    "@xmath0 since they would be produced alone without any other hard particle to recoil on .    the born contributions from cs and co transitions are indeed different in nature : the former is the production of a quarkonium in association with a recoiling gluon , which could form a jet , while the latter is the production of a quarkonium essentially alone at low @xmath0 .",
    "let us now have a look at the @xmath2 co contributions ( fig .",
    "[ diagram - d]-[diagram - f ] ) which are then nlo or one loop corrections to quarkonium production and which are potentially plagued by the typical divergences of radiative corrections .",
    "yet , the real - emission @xmath2 corrections to co contributions ( fig .",
    "[ diagram - d ] & [ diagram - e ] ) can also be seen as born - order contributions to the production of a quarkonium + a jet or , equally speaking , of a quarkonium with @xmath36 . as such",
    ", they do not show any soft divergences for @xmath37 .",
    "these are supposed to be the leading contribution to the @xmath0-differential cross section in most of the data set taken at hadron collider ( tevatron , rhic and lhc ) .",
    "these are now known up to one - loop accuracy , namely up to @xmath6 ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) ( fig .",
    "[ diagram - g ] & [ diagram - h ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that one can not avoid dealing with the divergences appearing at @xmath2 if one study the @xmath0-integrated cross section .      at @xmath35 ,",
    "the co partonic processes are : @xmath39}_{1 } ]   & \\hbox { ( { { fig.~\\ref{diagram - a } } } ) } \\\\ & g+g\\rightarrow q\\bar q[^{1}\\!s^{[8]}_{0 } , ^{3}\\!p^{[8]}_{j=0,2 } ] & \\hbox { ( { { fig.~\\ref{diagram - b } } } ) } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 denotes @xmath41 .    at @xmath2 ,",
    "the qcd corrections to the aforementioned channels include real ( fig .",
    "[ diagram - d ] & [ diagram - e ] ) and virtual ( fig .",
    "[ diagram - f ] ) corrections .",
    "one encounters uv , ir and coulomb singularities in the calculation of the virtual corrections .",
    "the uv - divergences from the self - energy and triangle diagrams are removed by the renormalisation procedure .",
    "since we follow the same lines as  @xcite where all the procedure is described , we do not repeat its description . as regards the real - emission corrections ,",
    "they arise from 3 kinds of processes ( not all drawn ) : @xmath42}_{0},^{3}\\!s^{[8]}_{1},^{3}\\!p^{[8]}_{j=0,2}]+g , \\\\ & g+q(\\overline{q})\\rightarrow q \\bar q[^{1}\\!s^{[0]}_{8},^{3}\\!s^{[8]}_{1},^{3}\\!p^{[8]}_{j=0,2}]+q(\\overline{q } ) , \\\\ & q+\\overline{q}\\rightarrow q \\bar q[^{1}\\!s^{[8]}_{0},^{3}\\!s^{[8]}_{1},^{3}\\!p^{[8]}_{j=0,1,2}]+g.\\end{split}\\ ] ] as usual , the phase - space integrations generate ir singularities , which are either soft or collinear and can be conveniently isolated by slicing the phase space into different regions . here",

    "@xcite provides the only acceptable description of the total cross section .",
    "we however note that the latter fit does not provide a good description of the @xmath3 polarisation data and , as recently noted  @xcite , it yields to negative cross section for @xmath78 at large @xmath0 .",

    "in addition , we also note the strange energy dependence of at least the @xmath80-wave octet channel .",
    "we postpone its discussion to section  [ section:1s08-nlo ] where this is analysed in more detail for the @xmath79}$ ] transition and , in section  [ section : csm - nlo ] , where we discuss a similar observation for the csm yield at nlo .    as regards the @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_dependence ] ( b ) ) , our nlo nrqcd results do not reproduce the data at all at rhic energies and , since both fits as dominated by the @xmath80-wave octet channel , shows a nearly unphysical behaviour at lhc energies .",
    "the comparison for the @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_dependence ] ( c ) ) , is more encouraging . at rhic energies and below",
    ", the agreement is even quite good , while at tevatron and lhc energies , the nlo nrqcd curves _ only _ overshoot the data by a factor of 2 .",
    "we finally note that from rhic to lhc energies , the lo csm contributions ( the blue in all the plots ) accounts well for the data .",
    "the agreement is a bit less good for @xmath18 if we stick only to the default / central value .",
    "this is not at all a surprise and is in line with the previous conclusions made in  @xcite .",
    "in fact , strangely enough , it seems that it is only at low energies ( below @xmath81  gev ) that the co contributions would be needed to describe the data .",
    "the more recent data from the lhc and the tevatron tend to agree more with the lo csm .",
    "overall , this shows unless the resummation of isr modifies our predictions by a factor of ten that it would be difficult to achieve a global description of the total and @xmath0-differential yield and its polarisation at least for the charmonia .",
    "as we discussed in the introduction , a first resummation study has recently been performed within nrqcd  @xcite . when combined with the results of  @xcite",
    ", this resummation yields  @xcite to a good description of the low-@xmath0 data .",

    "we have decided to look more carefully at the simplest one , that is from the @xmath79}$ ] transition in particular at how the scale choices influence the behaviour of the yield at large @xmath16 .",
    "analytical results for the hard - scattering partonic amplitude squared can be found in appendix c of  @xcite .",
    "we have used them in a small numerical code to convolve it with pdfs and checked them with the results of fdc .",
    "the advantage of using fdc is that we can easily cut on @xmath0 and @xmath89 .    as one could have anticipated from the band of the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_dependence ] ( a ) , one observes that for a wide range of scale choices , the energy dependence remains extremely flat . for some of the choice",
    "where @xmath90 , one even sees that the cross section clearly decreases and becomes negative  when the yield becomes negative the curve stops .",
    "this is of course not satisfactory . at this stage , we are not able to conclude from our observations normalisation and high energy issue whether these point at the break down of nrqcd factorisation , nrqcd universality or should force us to continue questioning our understanding of the mid- and high-@xmath0 quarkonium production mechanisms . to investigate this a bit further ,",

    "to go further in our investigations of qcd one - loop effects on the energy dependence of quarkonium production , we have found it useful to compare our results with those of the colour - evaporation model ( cem ) which directly follows from the quark - hadron duality  @xcite .",

    "it was argued  @xcite that a simple statistical counting , which would give : @xmath98 where the sum over @xmath99 runs over all the charmonium states below the @xmath100 threshold , could describe the existing data in the late 90 s .",

    "in particular , the singlet transition would be 100 times less probable that what one expects from the leptonic decay",
    ". this would be an unlikely and dramatic violation of factorisation which should have implications elsewhere .",
    "in particular , a pair produced at short distances with the same quantum number as the physical state , among these the colour , would have a much larger probability to be broken up before eventually hadronising than expected .    although it is not as obvious as in the nrqcd formulae of eq .",
    "[ eq : cem - ldme ] , where the hypotheses of the cem are translated into direct relations between co and cs transition probabilities , the same should happen in eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma_cem ] where all the colour configurations are summed over and then considered on the same footage . in a process where the cs configurations dominate , such as @xmath113 , csm and cem predictions necessarily differ .",
    "contrary to nrqcd which encompasses the csm , the cem does not encompass the csm . if one agrees with the data , the other can not .",
    "the matter is then how precise the predictions and the data are to rule out one approach or the other .",
    "overall , one has to acknowledge that the conventional cem central curves as simplistic as the underlying idea of the model can be give an account ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_dependence_cem ] ( a ) & ( b ) ) of the world data points as satisfactory as the lo csm .",
    "the latter seems to underestimate the data at low energies while the former only has trouble to account for the tev @xmath3 points ; the slope being more problematic than the normalisation which can be adjusted .",
    "all this is qualitative since the theoretical uncertainties on the cem are as large as that on the open heavy - flavour production which are admittedly large ( see  @xcite for an up - to - date discussion on the @xmath114 case ) .",
    "[ section : csm - nlo ]    as we just stated , the lo csm curves are providing a surprisingly good description of the @xmath3 and @xmath10 data at high energies without adjusting and even less twisting any parameters . although the central lo csm curves agree with the data , the conventional theoretical uncertainties from the arbitrary scales and the heavy - quark mass are large ( see the lower panels of  fig .  [",
    "fig : energy_dependence ] ) ) .",
    "it is therefore very natural to look whether these uncertainties are reduced at one - loop accuracy .",
    "such an observation was already made for the @xmath10 case in  @xcite but this study was limited to a single @xmath16 , _ i.e. _  200  gev .",
    "contrary the co channels , the one - loop corrections to the cs channels only arise at @xmath6 ( see _ e.g. _  fig .",
    "[ diagram - j ] & [ diagram - k ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , these are know since 2007  @xcite and can also be computed with fdc as done in  @xcite . in particular",
    ", there is no specific difficulty to integrate the @xmath2 and @xmath6 contributions in @xmath0 since they are finite at @xmath115 .",
    "+    however , as already noted in  @xcite , such nlo results tends to shows negative values at low @xmath0 which can have a non - negligible impact on the total ( _ i.e. _  @xmath0-integrated ) cross section . to our knowledge",

    "this is done below .    figs .",
    "[ fig : energy_dependence_csm ] show the energy dependence of the nlo csm ( 7 curves ) .",
    "note that , if a curve is not shown until 14 tev , this indicates that the total yield got _",
    "negative_. the 3 red curves correspond to the default scale choices ( @xmath116 ) and are indicative of the heavy - quark mass uncertainty , on the order of a factor of 4 for the @xmath3 and 2.5 for the @xmath10 . in the former case ,",
    "all 3 curves end up to be negative somewhere between 500 gev and 2 tev .",
    "note also that the upper curve at low energies , _ i.e. _  for @xmath117 gev , is the first to get negative and crosses the other ones as if the negative contribution were more important for lighter systems , see section [ subsec : etaq ] . ] . in the @xmath10 case",
    ", these 3 curves do not become negative at high energies we have checked it up to @xmath81 tev .",
    "nonetheless , they start to significantly differ from the lo curves ( 3 blue curves ) above 1 tev , contrary to the good lo vs nlo convergence found at rhic energies in  @xcite . one",
    "might thus be tempted to identify this weird energy behaviour to a _",
    "low-@xmath17 effect_.    going further in the @xmath3 case , one can vary the factorisation and renormalisation scales about the default choice . doing so , one obtains two classes of curves . for @xmath118 ( pink and orange )",
    ", the yield remains positive , but it is not less unphysical for it to be practically constant as the energy increases between 1 and 10 tev ! the only way to recover a semblance of increase is to take a large value of @xmath119 and seemingly also a small value for @xmath120 . obviously , whatever the reason for this behaviour is , for large enough @xmath119 , the qcd corrections which are proportional to @xmath121 necessarily get smaller and any difference between lo and nlo results should decrease . in the @xmath10 case , as for the @xmath3 case , both curves with @xmath118 ( pink and orange ) correspond to the highest yields at high energies and the lowest at low energies . when one chooses @xmath122 ( purple and green ) , the high - energy yields become negative both for @xmath3 and @xmath10 . in many",
    "respect , these observations are very similar to those made on the @xmath79}$ ]",
    ". such a pathological behaviour may thus not be related to the nature to the final state ( see also next section ) .",
    "large nnlo corrections are expected to show up at large energies ( low @xmath17 ) as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear if they could provide a solution to this issue .",
    "another way to solve this might be to resum initial state radiation as done in the cem  @xcite and for some co channels  @xcite .    at the light of such results ,",
    "the most that one can reasonably say is that the nlo csm results may be reliable for @xmath10 up to 200  gev and for @xmath3 up to 60  gev , that is up to @xmath16 about 20 times the quarkonium mass . above these value , the best that we have is the born order results .",
    "contrary to the spin - triplet case , one can obtain analytical formulae  @xcite for the spin - singlet pseudo - scalar production cross section such as that of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this can in principle be of some help to understand the weird energy behaviour of the cs @xmath15 yield and of some co channels .",
    "indeed , the lo production occurs as for some co channels without final - state - gluon radiation .",
    "in fact the final state is simply colourless .     +    as can be seen on figs .",
    "[ fig : energy_dependence_csm - etaq ] , the issue is similar in many respects but for the fact that one does not obtain negative yields for the @xmath14 . for the @xmath13 ,",
    "the curves for @xmath118 remains positive at high energies as for the @xmath3 .",
    "one also sees that the crossing of the central lo and nlo curves occurs at larger @xmath16 than for the @xmath15 states",
    ". however , such small quantitative differences may be due to the fact that we computed the @xmath89-integrated cross sections using the analytical expressions of @xcite instead of the @xmath89-differential cross section at @xmath123 .",
    "we have investigated this in more details by looking at the different nlo contributions ( the real emissions from @xmath124 and @xmath125 fusion as well as the virtual ( loop ) contributions ) in order to see which channels induce the negative contributions and for which scale / mass values .",
    "however , it must be stressed that the decomposition between these different contributions depend on the regularisation method used .",
    "for instance , the decomposition is drastically different when using fdc with sometimes a very large cancellation between the _ positive _ real - emission @xmath124 contribution and the _ negative _ sum of the born and loop @xmath124 contributions  and the formulae of  @xcite where all the @xmath124 contributions are gathered .",
    "yet , we checked that we obtain exactly the same results with both methods ; the regularisation method or numerical instabilities can not be the source of the issues observed above .    as regards the @xmath125 contribution , only @xmath126 matters to tell whether it will change sign . for @xmath120 close to @xmath127 and below",
    ", it will be positive ( negative ) at small ( large ) @xmath16 .",
    "otherwise , it remains negative for any @xmath16 .",
    "the value of @xmath119 only influences the normalisation .    as what concerns the @xmath124 contributions , which are expected to be dominant at high energies , both @xmath126 and @xmath128 matter . for @xmath129 ,",
    "the @xmath124 contribution monotonously increase as function @xmath16 irrespective of @xmath128 . for @xmath130 , the @xmath131 one is rather small and , despite being negative , does not induce a turn over in the increase of the cross section . for @xmath132 ,",
    "the @xmath124 contribution gets negative at large @xmath16 for @xmath133 . for @xmath134 , it remains always positive . yet",
    "the sum @xmath135 can still become negative since , in some cases , @xmath131 increases faster with @xmath16 .",
    "all this seems in lines , for the @xmath124 [ @xmath131 ] part , with the formulae ( c.25 ) and ( c.26 ) [ ( c.32 ) and ( c.35 ) ] in the appendix c of  @xcite .",
    "both contributions indeed exhibit logarithms of @xmath126 multiplied by a factor function of @xmath137 .",
    "as we can see , the results are already difficult to interpret for the spin singlet case . for the spin triplet",
    ", we do not have similar analytical results .",
    "we can only guess that the structure is similar .",
    "what seems surprising is that when one inspects similar expressions for the @xmath138 production at nlo in the tmd factorisation  @xcite , such negative terms do not appear as obvious .",
    "we are thus entitled to wonder whether such a formalism , which automatically resums logarithm of transverse momenta , may provide the solution to this issue .",
    "another possible solution may be the consideration of nnlo corrections , which may show opposite signs to that at nlo .",
    "this is obviously beyond the scope of our analysis .",
    "we have performed the first full analysis of the energy dependence of the quarkonium - production cross section at one - loop accuracy both in nrqcd and in the csm .",
    "taken at face value , our results would indicate a severe break down of nrqcd universality  in line with the previous analysis of maltoni _ et al . _",
    "@xcite  unless one keeps the ldmes close to the fit of butenschoen and kniehl , which however disagrees with the @xmath3 polarisation measurements and the @xmath13 cross sections .",
    "the situation is however slightly more intricate since we have uncovered a weird sometimes unphysical behaviour at large energies where one approaches the small-@xmath17 regime where non - linear effects in the parton densities may be relevant .",
    "this certainly casts doubts on the numerical values we obtained at lhc energies since collinear factorisation on which we based our analysis could break down .",
    "yet , up to a few hundred gev , the energy dependence of the different octet channels at nlo seems well behaved and there is no reason to doubt this . in this region ,",
    "the nlo yield prediction by nrqcd after fitting the mid- and high-@xmath0 quarkonium data _i.e . _  the yield and its polarisation would overshoot the data by a factor ranging from 4 to more than 10 .",
    "the same holds true at lo ( see  [ appendix ] ) . to reproduce the data",
    ", the co ldmes should be much smaller than what they are found in order to be to reproduce the tevatron and lhc @xmath0-differential cross section in the case of the @xmath3 and @xmath18",
    ".    on the other hand , the lo csm provides a decent energy dependence in agreement with the existing data , except for @xmath139 gev and is therefore up to ten times below the data - overshooting co contributions . at one loop ,",
    "the results are however ill - behaved for the charmonia and the cross sections can even become negative at large @xmath16 for some reasonable scale choices . the situation is a bit better for @xmath5 .",
    "the same occurs for the spin - singlet quarkonia . in this case ,",
    "one - loop results exist in the tmd factorisation approach and do not seem to be prone to such an issue . in the case of double @xmath3 production , the energy dependence at one loop seems well - behaved  @xcite . finally , we investigated the energy dependence of the yield in the cem where the final states are treated rather differently and we did not find any specific problems .",
    "we are therefore tempted to attribute this problem to initial - state effects .    in @xcite ,",
    "ma and venugopalan obtained a good description of the low-@xmath0 @xmath3 data over a wide range of energy by , on the one hand , using the ldmes from  @xcite our second set and , on the other , a cgc - based computation of the low-@xmath0 dependence . in reproducing the data",
    ", they found that the cs contribution is only 10% of the total yield .",
    "this 10% is reminiscent of the factor 10 between the cs and co in our `` collinear '' study . from our viewpoint",
    ", it looks as if the specific ingredient of this cgc - based computation would correspond to an effective reduction of the two - gluon flux by a factor of 10 .",
    "it is therefore very interesting to find out new processes which would be sensitive to this physics .",
    "the negative yields obtained in the collinear case  observed for @xmath79}$ ] , @xmath140}$ ] , @xmath50}$ ] , @xmath141}$ ] channels could also be cured by adding the large contributions of the one - loop amplitude squared thus positive .",
    "this may look like an _ ad - hoc _ solution which certainly questions the convergence of the perturbative series in @xmath142 .",
    "however , large nnlo corrections have already been discussed 10 years ago in  @xcite .",
    "another path towards a solution may also be higher - twist contributions  @xcite where two gluons come from a single proton as recently rediscussed in  @xcite .",
    "in any case , whatever the explanation for this situation may be , past claims that colour - octet transitions are dominantly responsible for low-@xmath0 quarkonium production were premature in light of the results presented here .",

    "<S> we compute the energy dependence of the @xmath0-integrated cross section of directly produced quarkonia in @xmath1 collisions at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , namely up to @xmath2 , within nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is based on the idea that the @xmath0-_integrated _ and the @xmath0-_differential _ cross sections can be treated as two different observables . </S>",
    "<S> the colour - octet nrqcd parameters needed to predict the @xmath0-integrated yield can thus be extracted from the fits of the @xmath0-differential cross sections at mid and large @xmath0 . for the first time , the total cross section is evaluated in nrqcd at full nlo accuracy using the recent nlo fits of the @xmath0-differential yields at rhic , the tevatron and the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> both the normalisation and the energy dependence of the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we obtained , are in disagreement with the data irrespective of the fit method . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true if one uses cem - like colour - octet nrqcd parameters . </S>",
    "<S> if , on the contrary , one disregards the colour - octet contribution , the existing data in the tev range are well described by the @xmath2 contribution in the colour - singlet model which , at @xmath6 , however shows an unphysical energy dependence . </S>",
    "<S> a similar observation is made for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this calls for a full nnlo or for a resummation of the initial - state radiation in this channel . in any case , past claims that colour - octet transitions are dominantly responsible for low-@xmath0 quarkonium production are not supported by our results . </S>",
    "<S> this may impact the interpretation of quarkonium suppression in high - energy proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions . </S>"
