    "most theoretical models for high - temperature superconductivity are based on hubbard or @xmath4 hamiltonians with one orbital per cuo@xmath3 plaquette .",
    "for the square lattice , the tight - binding part of such models reads in the @xmath5 representation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the hopping integral between nearest neighbors and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are hoppings between second and third order neighbors .",
    "the values of these parameters were estimated by fitting the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experimental data , see for example refs.@xcite , and also by first principles investigations , both periodic density - functional calculations within the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite and embedded cluster , wavefunction - based calculations @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the lda conduction bands in several copper oxide compounds yields a value of 0.40.5ev for @xmath7 and a ratio between the nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor hopping integrals @xmath10 for la@xmath0cuo@xmath3 @xcite and 0.33 for tl@xmath0ba@xmath0cuo@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "wavefunction - based , quantum chemical calculations on finite clusters predict very similar nearest - neighbor hoppings , with @xmath7 varying between 0.5 and 0.6 ev for different cuprate superconductors @xcite , with the observation that @xmath7 correponds in this case to the propagation of an oxygen @xmath1 hole and not to @xmath12-like conduction - band states",
    ". however , these estimates are quite far from the numbers obtained by fitting the arpes data .",
    "such procedures give usually nearest - neighbor hopping integrals in the range of 0.100.30ev for hole doping and 0.100.20ev for the electron doped materials @xcite .",

    "we perform _ ab initio _ multiconfiguration calculations @xcite on clusters that are large enough to account for charge _ and _ spin relaxation and polarization effects in the near surrounding .",
    "we show that the hopping of the doped particle is strongly renormalized by spin interactions with and among the @xmath13 cu @xmath14 neighbors and that by properly taking into account these effects , good agreement is found with the estimates extracted from the photoemission data for the hopping integrals .",

    "effects of such interactions between two or more holes were investigated in ref.@xcite by calculations on 7-plaquette linear clusters .",
    "for an undistorted 7-plaquette cluster and a single doped hole , the energy difference between the zr state and a broken - symmetry @xmath34-like state , both involving oxygens ions on the same plaquette , is again very small , about 5 mev , but the order of the states is reversed .",

    "the effect of spin interactions on the nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor hopping integrals can be evaluated by calculations on clusters of different sizes , where the o - mediated @xmath38 magnetic couplings are included either for all or only part of the transition metal neighbors . for clusters that are large enough , we can take into account both the ferromagnetic correlations between the @xmath12 electron on the zr plaquette and its nearest neighbors and the effect of the background antiferromagnetic couplings .",
    "the clusters we employ for our investigation always include a 2-plaquette `` active '' region with one oxygen @xmath1 hole plus a variable number of neighboring ( undoped ) plaquettes .",
    "the copper and oxygen ions on the two `` active '' plaquettes are modeled by all - electron split - valence basis sets of triple - zeta quality @xcite .",
    "depending on the size of the cluster , for the other cluster ions we either apply the same all - electron basis sets or use effective potentials for the core electrons .",
    "as mentioned above , point charges and total ion potentials are used for representing the rest of the crystal . for each cluster , we first determine the two equivalent casscf solutions where the @xmath1 hole is localized either on the `` left '' or on the `` right '' plaquette of the active region . since these states are obtained by separate scf calculations , they are non - orthogonal and interacting .",
    "non - interacting , orthogonal eigenstates can be obtained by state interaction ( si , or cassi ) calculations @xcite .",
    "the effective hopping integral is half of the energy separation between these cassi eigenstates @xcite . in terms of matrix elements between the separately optimized casscf wavefunctions , it can be written as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote hamiltonian and overlap matrix elements between @xmath42-electron states @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "for all calculations we use a minimal active space , with one active orbital for each @xmath12 and @xmath32 hole .",
    "the total spin multiplicity is doublet because we always consider an even number of plaquettes ( or cu sites ) and a single doped hole . during the casscf optimization for a particular @xmath1-hole quasilocalized state not only the electronic charge",
    "is allowed to relax but also the spin configuration of the nearby cu @xmath45 electrons is let to readjust , see for example the discussion in refs.@xcite .",
    "our approach for estimating the effective hoppings resembles in fact an idea proposed earlier by eder and becker @xcite , of setting up an effective tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 consist of a sum of products of a `` bare '' fermion operator and a number of spin flip operators .",
    "we note that for each hopping process within a `` rigid '' nel lattice the energy of the system increases by @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "this quantity , about 0.2ev ( the value of the antiferromagnetic coupling constant is @xmath50 mev @xcite ) , is comparable with the bare nearest - neighbor hopping of @xmath51 ev , see refs.@xcite and the results discussed below . by considering also the spin polarization effect described in the previous section , it can be argued that the magnetic energy associated with the disordered spins created at each hopping @xcite has the same magnitude with the bare hopping integral , i.e. the hopping of the @xmath1 hole and the spin relaxation in the immediate vicinity imply similar time scales .",
    "our procedure of mapping the _ ab initio _ data onto an effective tight - binding hamiltonian including also spin relaxation effects is thus justified .",
    "@xmath27 zr - like solutions where the oxygen hole is equally distributed over the four ligands of a given plaquette could not be obtained for 2-plaquette and linear 4-plaquette clusters with no distortions . for such clusters ,",
    "the o hole has always the largest weight onto one of the ligands connecting two cu ions .",
    "the smallest linear cluster where the casscf calculations converge to symmetric @xmath27 zr - like solutions is a 6-plaquette cluster .",
    "results obtained by casscf and cassi calculations on the 6-plaquette linear cluster are shown on the first line of tableii .",
    "all - electron basis sets were applied in this case for each ion of the cluster @xcite .",
    "the minimal - cas si nearest - neighbor hopping for the 6-plaquette linear cluster is 0.310 ev .",
    "this value decreases dramatically , however , when the cluster is enlarged such that it includes the other four cuo@xmath3 plaquettes which are first order neighbors of the two active plaquettes .",
    "this is a 10-plaquette cluster , schematically drawn in fig.2(a ) . in order to reduce the computational effort we used again , as in the 9-plaquette square cluster , the ecps of seijo _ et al .",

    "the msps for the cu and each o ion on this plaquette are @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",

    "the nearest - neighbor hopping matrix element is approximately 0.17 ev in this case , see tableii .",
    "this value is again much lower than the number extracted from the linear cluster .",
    "still , since spin interactions are taken into account for only part of the nearest - neighbor plaquettes around the zr - like quasiparticle , it is larger than the estimate for the 10-plaquette cluster .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that the value of this parameter changes only little when using effective core potentials instead of all - electron basis sets for the ions outside the active region , see the results for the @xmath60cu@xmath61o@xmath62@xmath59 $ ] cluster in tableii .",
    "we also point out that the occupation numbers of the @xmath67 @xmath68 b and ab combinations on the zr plaquettes and the mulliken charge populations of the @xmath1 atomic orbitals accomodating the oxygen hole are very similar for all the cu  o clusters discussed here . for comparison ,",

    "the @xmath69 zr - like orbitals on a cuo@xmath3 plaquette are not equivalent , and we denote these orbitals as @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath69 connects the two cu sites of the active region .",
    "a different numerical experiment that confirms the effects illustrated in tableii is to replace the eight cu@xmath24 @xmath71 cations surrounding the two active plaquettes in the 10-plaquette cluster , see fig.2(a ) , with closed - shell zn@xmath24 @xmath72 ions @xcite .",
    "the cassi estimate for @xmath7 in this @xmath60cu@xmath73zn@xmath63o@xmath58@xmath59 $ ] cluster is 0.450ev , larger than all values listed in tableii . for a @xmath60cu@xmath61zn@xmath74o@xmath58@xmath59 $ ] atomic configuration where only those four cu neighbors are replaced by zn@xmath24 @xmath72 ions which are not situated along the same line with the `` active '' cu sites , @xmath7 is lowered to 0.330ev , close to the estimate in the linear @xmath60cu@xmath61o@xmath75@xmath59 $ ] cluster from tableii .",
    "this latter value is about two times larger than in the @xmath60cu@xmath57o@xmath58@xmath59 $ ] cluster and indicates that the effect of interactions with and among cu @xmath12 spins which are not located along the direction of propagation is stronger than the effect of the collinear spin interactions .",
    "the next - nearest - neighbor hopping , usually denoted as @xmath8 , was evaluated by calculations on an 8-plaquette cluster like that sketched in fig.2(b ) .",
    "we applied the same ecp basis sets as for the 10-plaquette cluster for the o and cu ions surrounding the 2-plaquette active region , see above .",

    "our cassi estimate for @xmath8 is 0.015 ev , which gives a @xmath8/@xmath7 ratio of 0.11 in the weakly doped la@xmath0cuo@xmath3 system .",
    "a ratio @xmath76 was obtained by fitting the arpes data for an overdoped la@xmath77sr@xmath78cuo@xmath3 sample @xcite and @xmath79 for bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath80 @xcite .",
    "a few words are in place concerning the comparison between our present results and the results of other _ ab initio _ wavefunction - based investigations for copper oxide superconductors .",
    "a first issue is related to the nature of the active orbital space employed for the multiconfiguration calculations . for the 2-plaquette `` active '' cluster region",
    "we always consider a cas with three electrons and three orbitals .",
    "these three orbitals are a bonding @xmath68 linear combination , an essentially nonbonding @xmath12 ( or @xmath38 ) component , and an antibonding @xmath68 orbital .",
    "the bonding @xmath68 combination is usually @xcite included in the inactive , doubly occupied orbital set , which gives an active space with one electron and two orbitals if other @xmath12 orbitals around the 2-plaquette active cluster region are omitted .",
    "however , the occupation numbers associated with the pair of @xmath68 bonding and antibonding orbitals in the 3-orbital cas , about 1.8 and 0.2 , respectively ( see the discussion above and fig.1(b - c ) ) , indicate significant non - dynamical correlation effects @xcite . as a zeroth - order approximation , the 3-orbital cas seems to be then more appropriate for studying the character and the properties of a doped hole .",
    "multi - reference , difference - dedicated configuration interaction ( ddci ) @xcite calculations with reference wavefunctions having either two or three orbitals in the active space were performed on a hole doped 2-plaquette cluster by calzado and malrieu @xcite .",
    "they found that in the 2-plaquette cluster the ddci estimate for the nearest - neighbor hopping is in fact quite insensitive to the size of the active orbital space .",
    "in addition , an iterative ddci ( iddci ) scheme @xcite was applied in ref.@xcite for generating average molecular orbitals and to obtain an unbiased representation of the two states used to extract @xmath7 .",
    "it was concluded that the description of the oxygen hole in the iddci wavefunction is only little affected when decreasing the size of the active space from three to two orbitals .    for a 2-plaquette @xmath60cu@xmath73o@xmath81@xmath59 $ ] cluster and all - electron basis sets @xcite",
    "our cassi estimate for the nearest - neighbor hopping integral is 0.650ev , rather similar to the iddci value reported in ref.@xcite , @xmath82ev @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned above , the `` left '' and `` right '' -localized o hole states are asymmetric in the 2-plaquette cluster .",
    "using the same notations as in tableii , the mulliken charge populations of the @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath83 orbitals are 1.32 , 1.74 , and 1.68 , respectively .",
    "a straight comparison between our casscf / si results and the ddci / iddci data of calzado and malrieu is not possible .",
    "it is known @xcite , however , that ddci / iddci brings rather small corrections to the casci / casscf estimates for the nearest - neighbor hoppings on 2-plaquette clusters in various cuprates , not larger than @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that dynamical electron correlation is not essential in determining the magnitude of the hopping integrals , as already pointed out in refs.@xcite , for example . in any case , _ the spin _ polarization and relaxation effects at adjacent cu sites evidenced by our calculations on clusters of different sizes are mainly related to non - dynamical electron correlation , and induce changes of the hopping parameter about an order of magnitude larger than the corrections brought by ddci in 2-plaquette clusters .",
    "we also note that with the casscf / si approach we are able to treat explicitly _ charge _ relaxation and polarization due to the creation of an oxygen hole on a given cuo@xmath3 plaquette . in the context of _ ab initio _ calculations for estimating effective electronic - structure parameters such effects are sometimes referred to as dynamical repolarization effects . that a compact , transparent , and rather accurate description is obtained when the most important configurations contributing to the many - electron wavefunction are expressed in terms of individually optimized orbital sets was previously shown for the calculation of magnetic exchange coupling constants @xcite and core - level photoionized states @xcite in transition metal oxides .",
    "an effective nearest - neighbor hopping parameter @xmath7 can also be obtained by mapping the low - energy electronic states of the one - band hubbard model onto those of a _ pd",
    "hamiltonian is given by the following expression : @xmath85 @xmath86 is here the hopping matrix element between @xmath32 and @xmath12 orbitals at nearest - neighbor ligand and metal sites and the first sum is over all pairs of such nearest neighbors .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath86 takes the same value for all these cu ",
    "the second sum in the expression above is over all pairs of nearest - neighbor anions and @xmath87 is the corresponding matrix element .",
    "we have chosen the phases of the orbitals such that the sign of each of the two hopping matrix elements is constant .",
    "the difference between the on - site @xmath12 and @xmath32 orbital energies is in the electron representation @xmath88 and @xmath89 , @xmath90 are the on - site coulomb repulsion energies for cu and o , respectively . for the parameters of our @xmath27 model we use typical values such as @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , in units of ev .",
    "the effective one - band hubbard model is given by @xmath96 @xmath7 corresponds here to the effective hopping of the zr - like quasiparticle between nearest - neighbor cuo@xmath3 plaquettes .",
    "@xmath97 is the `` on - site '' coulomb interaction and we choose @xmath98 ev .",
    "ground - state and excited - state calculations for the @xmath27 and the one - band hubbard models are performed by using dmrg techniques . for hole - doped clusters of @xmath99 and @xmath100 cuo@xmath3 plaquettes we found that the lowest - lying states in the two models have the same quantum numbers and the same character .",
    "we can make thus between the two models a simple one - to - one correspondence for several low - energy states .",
    "the effective hopping parameter @xmath7 is then determined such that it minimizes a function @xmath101 where @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) are relative energies of the lowest four excited eigenstates in the @xmath27 ( hubbard ) model .",
    "the ground - state is denoted with @xmath104 . for @xmath99 and @xmath100",
    "clusters , each doped with two holes , our mapping procedure gives effective @xmath7 values of @xmath105 and @xmath106 ev , respectively .",
    "this reduction of @xmath7 is due not only to the inclusion of antiferromagnetic correlations on the adjacent chains but also to an increase of the nearest - neighbor spin correlations along the chain . within the @xmath27 model , the nearest - neighbor spin correlation function changes from @xmath107 in the @xmath99 chain to @xmath108 for the central chain in the @xmath100 ladder . for more chains",
    "this quantity is only slightly modified , to @xmath109 for example in a @xmath110 cluster .",
    "the model - hamiltonian calculations confirm thus the renormalization effect found by _ ab initio _ quantum chemical methods .",
    "if six holes are doped into the @xmath100 cluster , i.e. the hole concentration is kept constant with respect to the @xmath99 2-hole configuration , the effective hopping is @xmath111 ev , which shows that for this range of hole concentrations the doping dependence is very small .",
    "the interplay among charge , spin , and lattice degrees of freedom and the formation of composite spin - lattice polarons were studied in cuprates ( and other transition metal oxide compounds ) by many authors . in layered copper oxides , the spin mechanism responsible for polaronic - like behavior",
    "is associated with the fact that a charge carrier hopping to an adjacent site must disrupt , at least at relatively low doping , the antiferromagnetic spin configuration in its vicinity .",
    "such effects were investigated by calculations based on one - band hubbard and @xmath4 models , see for example refs.@xcite .",
    "these studies show indeed that the background antiferromagnetic correlations lead to band narrowing and a strong enhancement of the electron - phonon couplings .",
    "we are able to provide here _ ab initio _ numerical estimates for the effect of such interactions on the effective hopping integrals .",
    "the results can explain the relatively low values deduced for the quasiparticle hopping parameters from fits of the photoemission data .",
    "our _ ab initio _ calculations also show that an oxygen hole induces ferromagnetic correlations between the @xmath12 electron on the zr - like plaquette and the nearest - neighbor cu @xmath12 spins .",
    "such effects are missing in one - band hubbard or @xmath4 models . at this moment",
    "we are not able to quantify the strength of these ferromagnetic interactions in the form of effective magnetic coupling constants or spin correlation functions , at least not at the _ ab initio _ level .",
    "nevertheless , this spin polarization effect is one of the factors that determines the characteristics of the hole motion .",
    "it might also offer an explanation for the disappearence of long - range antiferromagnetic order at doping levels which are much lower as compared to the electron doped cuprates .",
    "it is interesting that for an isolated chain of plaquettes , `` local '' ferromagnetic correlations in the direction of propagation would tend to facilitate the motion of the hole , although the fact that the carrier perturbs the magnetic couplings beyond nearest neighbors results in a stronger and opposite effect .",
    "in addition to that , the effective hopping parameter depends strongly on interactions involving spins on adjacent chains , i.e. cu @xmath12 spins which are not situated along the direction of propagation of the hole .",
    "qualitatively , this is also confirmed by mapping the solutions of a @xmath27 model hamiltonian onto those of an effective one - band hubbard model for clusters consisting of chains or ladders of plaquettes .",
    "the inclusion of the adjacent antiferromagnetic chains in a three - leg ladder determines a reduction of the effective nearest - neighbor hopping of about fifty percent in comparison to the case of a single chain .",

    "<S> holes doped within the square cuo@xmath0 network specific to the cuprate superconducting materials have oxygen @xmath1 character . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the basic properties of such oxygen holes by wavefunction - based quantum chemical calculations on large embedded clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a @xmath1 hole induces ferromagnetic correlations among the nearest - neighbor cu @xmath2 spins . </S>",
    "<S> when moving through the antiferromagnetic background the hole must bring along this spin polarization cloud at nearby cu sites , which gives rise to a substantial reduction of the effective hopping parameters . </S>",
    "<S> such interactions can explain the relatively low values inferred for the effective hoppings by fitting the angle - resolved photoemission data . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the background antiferromagnetic couplings of renormalizing the effective nearest - neighbor hopping is also confirmed by density - matrix renormalization - group model hamiltonian calculations for chains and ladders of cuo@xmath3 plaquettes . </S>"
