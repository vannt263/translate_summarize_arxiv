    "in spite of several decades of intensive experimental and theoretical studies of the radiative capture of nuclei at low - energies , reactions of this type remain a focus of research activities .",
    "one of the main reasons for this continued and growing interest in this kind of nuclear processes is their importance in understanding the big bang nucleo - synthesis and stellar evolution ( particularly processes that occur in the interior of the sun ) .",
    "another aspect of astrophysical relevance that requires improved knowledge of the stellar fusion reactions , is the solar neutrino flux problem . in particular , a recent assessment  @xcite of the current understanding of solar neutrino fluxes called for new measurements of the @xmath1 reaction cross section at very low ( solar ) energies with an accuracy of better than @xmath65% .",
    "of course , it is a serious challenge for an experiment measuring cross sections at low energies to reach such a precision since the reaction yield rate is extremely small due to the strong coulomb repulsion .    some current challenges for nuclear astrophysics can be met with new experimental facilities such as the ones at the laboratory for underground nuclear astrophysics ( luna )  @xcite that is part of italy s gran sasso national laboratory ( lngs ) .",
    "the luna collaboration has reported on their first measurements  @xcite of the @xmath1 total cross section at very low ( down to 127  kev ) center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energies with a total uncertainty of 4% .",
    "high - precision measurements of cross sections for other radiative - capture reactions of astrophysical relevance are under way  @xcite .",
    "however , some processes are , and will remain the province of purely theoretical studies .",
    "nonetheless , the impressive progress achieved in recent times in the experimental studies of low - energy radiative - capture reactions is an additional argument for boosting research activities on the theoretical side as well .",
    "the photon - emission process relevant to stellar fusion reactions is known  @xcite to occur dominantly at a large ( extra - nuclear ) distance .",
    "in general , then , one may assume that no intermediate `` compound '' nuclear system is formed .",
    "if that is so , the process is defined as a direct - capture reaction .",
    "the @xmath1 reaction , which provides termination of the proton - proton stellar chain through @xmath7 burning , is a one case where successful application of the direct - capture model as a description of the photon emission process has been made .",
    "one of the earliest detailed analysis of this reaction , and of the mirror process @xmath8 , assuming a two - body direct - capture picture was made in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the calculations of the total cross section and of the astrophysical @xmath2 factor ,",
    "the authors of that paper used a bound - state radial wave function taken in the asymptotic ( whittaker ) form while a repulsive nuclear hard - core model that took into account coulomb distortion was used to describe the initial ( scattering ) state .",
    "such a choice for the initial - state model was favoured by the analysis of the then existing experimental data for elastic @xmath9 scattering from the @xmath10 nucleus and the phase shifts deduced therefrom .",
    "it was shown many years later  @xcite that this repulsive effect can also result from inner oscillation in the overlap with the relative wave function of the two nuclei .",
    "those later calculations were made using both a two - body potential model and the orthogonality condition model ( ocm )  @xcite to construct the wave function .",
    "the direct nature of many of stellar reactions suggests that using a cluster model may be an appropriate approach for their description .",
    "in general , a great amount of experimental information on these reactions has been accumulated and extensive cluster - model studies of the stellar fusion processes have been made  @xcite .",
    "methodologically , studies have ranged from the potential cluster models  @xcite ) which consider the two clusters as point - like objects in a two - body potential , to microscopic approaches which include the resonating - group method ( rgm )  @xcite as well as the generator coordinate method  @xcite and the ocm  @xcite , both of which are closely related to the rgm .",
    "in addition to the cluster models , the variational monte carlo technique has been elaborated  @xcite and applied in studies of few - nucleon systems . the dynamical input in this approach is given by microscopic ( nucleon - nucleon ) interactions .",
    "doing so provides a universality of description and reduces the number of model parameters . in an application of this approach  @xcite ,",
    "total cross sections for the reactions @xmath1 and @xmath8 from calculations were found . but this technique could not reproduce adequately nuclear binding energies , and the states of @xmath11 were so under - bound as to be nonphysical . on the other hand , microscopic grounds to justify use of potential cluster models have been established within the so - called microscopic potential model  @xcite .",
    "possible extensions of the two - cluster model space were also studied within that approach ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . nevertheless , many of essential dynamical features of low - energy radiative capture processes with light nuclei are still missing in the existing theoretical models .",
    "one of the important issues that has not been properly addressed so far is the role in the em process of collective ( rotational and vibrational ) degrees of freedom of the colliding nuclei .",
    "this is a serious omission since neglect of low - energy collective excitations and the corresponding resonances they produce can alter cross sections at low energies substantially .",
    "thus the usual theoretical @xmath2-factor extrapolation from the quantities determined by measurement , to the energy region of astrophysical interest can be incorrect .",
    "recently a multi - channel algebraic scattering ( mcas ) approach  @xcite has been developed in which the interaction of a nucleon with a nucleus is described within the collective model  @xcite .",
    "extension of this approach to the treatment of the two - cluster systems has been made  @xcite .",
    "the mcas model exploits the so - called orthogonalizing pseudo - potential ( opp ) method  @xcite reformulated to take account of the influence of the pauli exclusion principle in the collective model .",
    "this method is closely related to the ocm  @xcite , in which the physical two - body states are obtained by renormalization that ensures their orthogonality to a certain number of unphysical bound states .",
    "the opp method does not involve intrinsic degrees of freedom for the two fragments .",
    "instead , an extra nonlocal contribution to the original two - body potential is constructed  @xcite .",
    "the mcas approach solves the low energy coupled equations for the interacting systems , and to use information gleaned from such in capture reaction studies , the photon - emission operator has to be developed within a two - cluster coupled - channel model that also takes into account cluster sizes and the explicit coupling to their intrinsic excitations .    to construct such an operator , we start from the extension  @xcite of the siegert theorem  @xcite , expressing the electromagnetic ( em ) current operator in terms of so - called generalised electric and magnetic moments of the nuclear system .",
    "then , the amplitude of the em transition is determined by matrix elements of that operator between nuclear states and the electric and magnetic field strengths .",
    "this explicitly gauge independent representation for the amplitude guarantees the fulfilment of the siegert theorem for electric transitions in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "decomposition of the em operator into electric and magnetic parts is accomplished in a 3-dimensional form which assists in derivation of expressions for the low - energy operator of photon emission ( or absorption ) by a system of two extended clusters in terms of their macroscopic properties ( the mean square radii , magnetic dipole moments and electric quadrupole moments ) starting from the microscopic ( single - particle ) treatment of the total system .",
    "herein we present expressions for the two - cluster em operator and for calculation of observables for low - energy nuclear radiative capture instigated by this operator .",
    "the wave functions for the initial ( scattering ) and final ( bound ) states will be built within the mcas scheme . in the next section ,",
    "the manifestly gauge independent expression for the photon - emission amplitude based on the extension of the siegert theorem is described .",
    "[ sec3 ] contains derivation of the operator of single - photon emission by a system of two extended clusters , while the wave function construction according to the mcas method is detailed in sec .",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ sec5 ] , results of application of this general formalism to describe the @xmath1 reaction are reported .",
    "results for the cross section and the @xmath2 factor are discussed and compared with experimental data , and notably that from the luna experiment  @xcite . in the context of applications of the mcas approach ,",
    "the reaction studied is considered as a simplified test calculation since it does not yet involve inelastic channels .",
    "our future plans are to use this method to study more complex reactions where inclusion of low - lying inelastic channels will be an important aspect of the dynamics .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "the amplitude of transition of a nuclear system from an initial state @xmath12 to a state @xmath13 with emission of a single photon with the energy ( momentum ) @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and the polarization vector @xmath16 @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the em current operator at the space - time point @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) denote the total energy and momentum for the initial ( final ) state , and indices @xmath27 and @xmath28 refer to system `` intrinsic '' degrees of freedom .    for the operator @xmath29 and the hamiltonian @xmath30 of the nuclear system , the continuity equation @xmath31\\ , \\label{ce}\\ ] ] has to hold .",
