    "the observational cosmological data indicate that the present values for dark energy and matter components in terms of a critical energy density are approximately @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this observational evidence is compelling for a spatially flat and low matter density universe which nowadays is in a period of accelerated expansion .",
    "an immediate consequence of this observational scenario is that the cosmological fluid seems to be dominated by some sort of dark energy .",
    "this kind of fantastic energy that remains unclustered at all scales and has negative pressure plays a predominant role in the present epoch . some of the candidates postulated for modeling dark energy",
    "are the cosmological constant @xmath3 having an equation of state @xmath4 ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the effective pressure and energy density of the universe ) , and the so called quintessence models which typically leads to an equation of state parameter ranging in the interval @xmath7 .",
    "however in the case of the cosmological constant the @xmath8cdm model failed in explaining why the inferred value of @xmath9 is so tiny ( 120 orders of magnitude lower ) compared to the typical vacuum energy values inferred by particle physics ( the coincidence problem ) @xcite . in spite of being successful in fitting the observational data in the majority of quintessential models the coincidence problem even prevails .",
    "another interesting class of models that also fits the observational data are the called phantom cosmologies @xcite . on this phantom scenarios the equation of state parameter satisfies @xmath10 .",
    "the phantom energy component predicted in some of this models is compatible with most classical tests of cosmology based on the current data including the type sneia data as well as the cosmic microwave background anisotropy and mass power spectrum .",
    "+ on the other hand , during the last years theories in more than four dimensions have become one of the fundamental cornerstones of modern physics .",
    "the most appealing are string theories @xcite , braneworld inspired models @xcite , the class of kaluza - klein theories and among the last ones the induced matter theory ( imt ) is counted @xcite .",
    "the imt is based on the assumption that ordinary matter and physical fields that we can observe in our 4d universe can be geometrically induced from a 5d space - time in vacuum due to the existence of a noncompact extra dimension @xcite . on this framework",
    ", inflationary models induced from a 5d vacuum state where the expansion of the universe is driven by a single scalar ( inflaton ) field have been subject of great activity during the last years @xcite .",
    "+ in this letter our interest is to investigate the possibility of obtaining phantom cosmological scenarios from a 5d vaccum state . in order to achieve it we use a dynamical foliation on the space - like fifth",
    "coordinate , here considered as noncompact .",
    "the letter is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "ii we introduce the cosmological function in a geometrical manner . in sect .",
    "iii we study three examples ; in the first one we study an expansion with a constant cosmological function in the second we study a decaying cosmological function extracting a quintessential scenario while in the third example we obtain a phantom scenario from a decaying cosmological function finally , in sect .",
    "iv we give some final remarks .",
    "in order to introduce a variable cosmological function @xmath11 in a geometrical manner we consider the recently introduced 5d line element @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the 3d euclidean metric , @xmath14 is the cosmic time and @xmath15 is the space - like extra dimension . choosing a natural unit system the cosmological function @xmath0 has units of @xmath16^{-2}$ ] .",
    "after some straightforward calculations it can be easily shown that the metric @xmath17 in ( [ a1 ] ) is riemann - flat and consequently ricci - flat , making it a suitable metric for describing a 5d vacuum .",
    "note that we are working within the context of the induced matter theory and the riemann flatness of the metric ( [ a1 ] ) do not modify in any way the mechanism here proposed .",
    "in other words this mechanism is valid in general for every ricci - flat metric containing @xmath0 and the metric ( [ a1 ] ) must be taken as a particular solution of @xmath18 . +",
    "now let us to assume that the 5d space - time can be dynamically foliated with generic dynamical hypersurfaces @xmath19 .",
    "thus the line element ( [ a1 ] ) on @xmath20 becomes @xmath21dt^{2}-f^{2}(t)\\,e^{2\\int \\sqrt{\\lambda(t)/3}\\,dt}dr^{2},\\ ] ] with the dot denoting derivative with respect to the time @xmath14 . adopting the continuity conditions introduced by j. ponce de leon in @xcite to get a 4d frw - metric on @xmath20",
    ", we obtain @xmath22 being @xmath23 an effective scale factor describing the 3d - spatial expansion on @xmath20 . in general , solutions of equation ( [ a3 ] ) determine a family of hypersurfaces @xmath24 where the line element ( [ a2 ] ) is valid whereas equation ( [ a4 ] ) specifies an effective scale factor @xmath23 for every element of the family .",
    "+ on a generic hypersurface @xmath19 the induced 4d einstein equations read @xmath25 where @xmath26 , being @xmath27 the newton s constant and the induced matter density @xmath28 and pressure @xmath29 are given by @xmath30 the system ( [ v1])-([v2 ] ) can be interpreted as the dynamical equations of a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology with a 4d energy momentum tensor given by @xmath31 , being @xmath32 the 4-velocities associated to the 4d - comoving observers on every dynamical hypersurface @xmath33 . in other words we have induced from 5d - vacuum an energy - momentum tensor that can be interpreted as an energy - momentum tensor describing a perfect fluid under the presence of a cosmological function @xmath34 .",
    "this energy - momentum tensor can be written in terms of an effective energy density @xmath35 and an effective pressure @xmath5 as @xmath36 , being @xmath37 and @xmath5 defined by @xmath38 using ( [ v3 ] ) , ( [ v4 ] ) and ( [ v5 ] ) we can establish an effective equation of state ( eos ) of the form @xmath39 , where the eos parameter @xmath40 is determined by @xmath41.\\ ] ] employing equation ( [ a4 ] ) the induced deceleration parameter @xmath42 on the brane @xmath43 acquires the form @xmath44}{\\left [ \\dot{f}+ \\sqrt { \\lambda / 3}\\,f\\right]^2}.\\ ] ] by simple inspection of expression ( [ a3 ] ) it can be easily seen that when we assume _ a priori _ constant foliations and consider the case of a cosmological constant @xmath45 the corresponding constant foliations are determined by @xmath46 .",
    "then it follows from ( [ v6 ] ) and ( [ pv7 ] ) that the effective eos parameter and the deceleration parameter become @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively , describing in this way a perfect vacuum eos .",
    "moreover from expression ( [ a4 ] ) the corresponding scale factor is @xmath49 $ ] which indicates that under that conditions we can recover a de - sitter expansion .",
    "another immediate implication that arises from equation ( [ a3 ] ) is that if we regard ( _ a priori _ ) a constant cosmological function @xmath45 , in principle it is possible to have a dynamical foliation @xmath50 that satisfies ( [ a3 ] ) .",
    "these cases are the subject of the following examples .",
    "the simplest case that we can consider in our analysis is when the cosmological function @xmath51 is constant .",
    "in such a case the continuity conditions ( [ a3 ] ) and ( [ a4 ] ) yield @xmath52 solving ( [ a5 ] ) we obtain @xmath53,\\ ] ] @xmath54,\\ ] ] being @xmath55 an integration constant that could be interpreted as some initial time .",
    "clearly @xmath56 corresponds to a couple of constant foliations while @xmath57 and @xmath58 give dynamical ones .",
    "the friedmann equations ( [ v1 ] ) and ( [ v2 ] ) read @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the induced energy density and pressure in the presence of @xmath9 . as we mentioned in the previous section in the case of the hypersurfaces @xmath62 corresponding eos parameter and the deceleration parameter are just @xmath63 and @xmath64 . however in the cases of @xmath57 and @xmath58 they become @xmath65,\\qquad\\omega _ { eff}(f_{3})=-\\left[1 + \\frac{2}{27}\\,e^{-2\\sqrt{\\lambda _ 0 /3}(t - t_{0})}\\right],\\\\ \\label{a12 } & & q_{eff}(f_{2})=-\\left[1 + 9e^{-2\\sqrt{\\lambda _ { 0}/3}(t - t_0 ) } \\right],\\qquad q_{eff}(f_3)=-\\left[1+\\frac{1}{9}\\,e^{-2\\sqrt{\\lambda _ 0 /3}(t - t_0)}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from these expressions we can see immediately that when @xmath66 , all of them tend asymptotically to a de - sitter cosmology . or in geometrical terms we can say that in the present case the asymptotic limit of the dynamical foliations are the constant ones .",
    "the results discussed in the previous sections have been obtained interpreting the continuity condition ( [ a3 ] ) as an equation whose solutions determine the dynamical foliations on which the line element ( [ a2 ] ) holds .",
    "something remarkable to find solutions of ( [ a3 ] ) is that we must know _ a priori _ an algebraic expression for the cosmological function @xmath0 or having an extra criterion to provide it .",
    "however , we can interpret equation ( [ a3 ] ) from another point of view .",
    "we can regard expression ( [ a3 ] ) as a criterion of choosing or inducing cosmological functions when we give a suitable family of dynamical hypersurfaces that satisfies ( [ a3 ] ) . in mathematical terms , we mean that we can express equation ( [ a3 ] ) as @xmath67.\\ ] ] from this point of view for a given hypersurface @xmath68 or dynamical foliation we have an induced @xmath0 specified by the expression ( [ ma1 ] ) .",
    "the freedom that we have now for choosing a suitable dynamical foliation can be reduced if we inspire our election in the physical situation or the issue addressed with this formalism . in particular we are interested in cosmological applications and in particular in study the epochs of the universe where the presence of a dynamical cosmological is preponderant .",
    "+ thus , in order to illustrate the formalism let us to consider the particular cases when we have @xmath69 and @xmath70 , being @xmath71 a nonzero constant parameter and @xmath72 the constant hubble parameter .",
    "thus the induced cosmological functions @xmath0 according to ( [ ma1 ] ) are respectively @xmath73 using equation ( [ a4 ] ) it follows that the effective scale factors in both cases are given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is some initial time determined as an initial condition .",
    "as it is natural of being expected the first scale factor corresponds to a de sitter expansion while the second one correspond a power - law type expansion . clearly",
    "the case of a constant hubble parameter corresponds to a constant foliation , so that as we have shown before in that case both the effective eos parameter and the effective deceleration parameter become -1 describing a de - sitter expansion .",
    "however the case of power law expanding universe is more interesting .",
    "in such a case the @xmath40 and @xmath76 read @xmath77,\\\\ q_{eff}&= & -\\frac{\\sigma } { \\sigma + 1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] being @xmath78 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath79 and @xmath76 is plotted in the figures [ [ fig1 ] ] and [ [ fig2 ] ] .",
    "notice that both , @xmath80 and @xmath76 remain above @xmath81 for @xmath82 but always are negative .",
    "more specifically , for @xmath83 we obtain : @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which means that we are mimicking a period of quintessential expansion . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that the both parameters @xmath79 and @xmath76 remain always negative is interpreted here as the metric ( [ a1 ] ) in the present mechanism can only describe phases in the evolution of the universe which are dominated by vacuum energy , or equivalently by a cosmological function @xmath0 . in more general terms we can say that under the consideration of foliations like @xmath70 the metric in ( [ a1 ] ) is able of describing only phases of accelerated expansion of the universe .      in this section",
    "our interest is to extract some phantom cosmological scenarios from a geometrically induced @xmath0 .",
    "this cosmological function @xmath8 must be a decreasing function of time in order to explain its tiny value today @xcite .",
    "phantom cosmology is an alternative to explain the present accelerated expansion of the universe characterized by an eos parameter @xmath86 . as it was shown in @xcite within the context of 5d cosmological theories solutions for the scale factor involving hyperbolic functions can describe an accelerated expansion and in particular the present one . on the other hand",
    ", we must note that from ( [ a4 ] ) we can derive the expression @xmath87 , so it results clear given that @xmath8 is written in terms of the dynamical foliation @xmath88 that if we want to obtain a scale factor @xmath23 in terms of hyperbolic functions like in @xcite the dynamical foliation @xmath89 must be also given in terms of hyperbolic functions .",
    "thus in order to show the possibility to extract phantom cosmological scenarios by using the formalism here discussed , let us try the ansatz for the dynamical foliation @xmath88 given by @xmath90,\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the time when the period of accelerated expansion to be mimicked begins and @xmath92 and @xmath93 being not null constant parameters having @xmath92 units of _ length _ and @xmath93 units of _ ( length ) @xmath94 _ ( note that here we are using natural units ) . thus it follows from the equation ( [ ma1 ] ) that the induced cosmological function has the form @xmath95+\\frac{1}{\\beta ^2}\\right],\\ ] ] which for values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 satisfying @xmath96 is a decreasing function of time .",

    "in this letter we have derived phantom cosmologies from a 5d riemann - flat space - time with the metric ansatz ( [ a1 ] ) and where the fifth coordinate has been regarded as noncompact . our formalism is based on the assumption that the 5d space - time can be dynamically foliated by a family of 4d hypersurfaces @xmath43 . in order to induce a frw line element on every 4d hypersurface",
    "we have adopted the continuity conditions of ponce de leon ( [ a3 ] ) and ( [ a4 ] ) . on that framework",
    "we have shown that the energy momentum tensor geometrically induced on every dynamical hypersurface can perfectly describe a perfect fluid under the presence of a variable cosmological function @xmath0 . in this sense",
    "the present formalism can be considered as a way of introducing a cosmological function @xmath0 geometrically from pure 5d vacuum . by reinterpreting the condition ( [ a3 ] ) we have established a geometrical criterion for assigning cosmological functions @xmath0 which depends only of the dynamical foliation adopted .",
    "+ when we regard the foliation @xmath68 , the induced 4d dynamics is governed by the system ( [ v1])- ( [ v2 ] ) .",
    "when the condition ( [ a5 ] ) is adopted it can be easily seen that this induced dynamics describes a 4d universe with an effective 4d frw metric @xmath102 . under this",
    "conditions a quintessential expanding period in the evolution of the universe can be mimicked . in this case",
    "we obtain a 4d effective eos parameter @xmath103 and a deceleration parameter @xmath76 range between @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively , when @xmath83 . one interesting feature of both @xmath40 and @xmath76 is that they remain negative and always above @xmath81 for @xmath83 .",
    "this characteristic suggests that under that conditions the metric ansatz ( [ a1 ] ) can describe only periods of accelerated expansion of the universe dominated by a dark energy here mimicked by a geometrically induced cosmological function @xmath0 .",
    "+ finally , phantom cosmological scenarios can be also obtained by choosing a suitable dynamical foliation .",
    "more precisely we can obtain phantom scenarios from a geometrically induced cosmological function @xmath0 . in this case regarding for instance",
    "the particular foliation @xmath106 $ ] we can induce for @xmath107 a decaying cosmological function @xmath0 that can lead to a phantom scenario .",
    "other possible explanation to solve the called cosmological constant problem , but in 4d , was developed in @xcite .",
    "in particular for @xmath100 and @xmath108 we can achieve a phantom scenario which tends asymptotically to a de - sitter expansion .",
