    "the early evolution of early - type ( elliptical and s0 ) galaxies can provide a strong constraint on galaxy - formation models . because early type galaxies form the dominant population in nearby rich clusters ( oemler 1974 ; dressler 1980 ) , they are very efficiently studied in clusters .",
    "according to many important observations made for clusters at @xmath14 , it is well established that the majority of the early - type galaxies observed in nearby and intermediate - redshift ( @xmath15 ) clusters mainly consist of old stellar    populations formed at high redshifts ( @xmath16 , e.g. , oconnell 1988 ; bower et al .  1992 ; aragn - salamanca et al .",

    "1998 ) .",
    "on the other hand , there are also many pieces of evidence suggesting that the evolution of the entire cluster galaxy population is not as simple as expected from the monolithic galaxy formation scenario .",
    "it is known that the fraction of blue galaxies in clusters increases rapidly with the redshift at @xmath14 ( butcher , oemler 1978 , 1984 ; rakos , schombert 1995 ) . through previous spectroscopic studies of intermediate - redshift clusters",
    ", it is also known that a significant fraction of galaxies have emission - lines and/or post - starburst signatures ( e.g. , dressler , gunn 1992 ; postman et al .",
    "1998 ; dressler et al .  1999 ; poggianti et al .  1999 ) .",
    "such blue and star - forming galaxies are notably rare in rich clusters at @xmath17 .",
    "recent ground - based spectroscopic observation and hubble space telescope ( hst ) high - resolution imaging have further revealed a population of old galaxies with ongoing or recent ( within a few gyr prior to the observation ) star - formation activity as well as a significantly large fraction of late - type disk galaxies and closely interacting systems in intermediate redshift clusters ( abraham et al .",

    "this star - forming activity of cluster galaxies is possibly related to the evolution of the morphological mix of the cluster galaxy populations , particularly , the origin of s0 galaxies ( dressler et al .",
    "1997 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; kuntschner , davis 1998 ) . as a natural extension of these results",
    ", it is expected that a stronger evolution of galaxies may be observed in clusters at higher redshifts .",
    "recently , more than several clusters and cluster candidates have been discovered at @xmath18 ( dickinson 1995 ; postman et al .",

    "can be seen more clearly .",
    "a rapid change in the colors of passively evolving galaxies only occurs within @xmath1923  gyr after the end of the star formation ( e.g. , bower et al .",
    "1992 , 1998 ) .",
    "if cluster early - type galaxies formed at @xmath20 and evolved passively , one can expect conspicuous color changes only at @xmath18 .",
    "one may also expect more frequent star - formation activity at higher redshifts , since there are a significant fraction of galaxies with poststarburst signatures in intermediate - redshift clusters ( couch , sharples 1987 ; dressler , gunn 1992 ; barger et al .",
    "1996 ; postman et al .  1998 ; couch et al .  1998 ; poggianti et al .",
    "a simple extrapolation of the butcher  oemler effect ( butcher , oemler 1984 ) also predicts a blue galaxy fraction greater than 50% at @xmath21 .",
    "it is therefore interesting to extend the detailed color analysis to other clusters at @xmath18 , and to probe the early history of star formation in clusters .    to date",
    ", however , only a few clusters at @xmath18 have been studied in detail by multicolor photometry ( stanford et al .",

    "the two largest difficulties in studying the galaxy population in these high - redshift clusters are : ( 1 ) the faintness of the cluster galaxies due to the large distance from us and ( 2 ) contamination of the foreground and the background galaxies , as they tend to dominate the galaxy surface number density on the sky towards the high redshift clusters .",
    "we have overcome these difficulties by utilizing the huge light - collecting power of the 8 m subaru telescope and by applying a photometric - redshift technique to isolate the possible cluster members .",
    "we discuss in this paper the 3c 324 cluster at @xmath0 .",
    "an excess of galaxy surface number density in this region was recognized by kristian , sandage , and katem ( 1974 ) and by spinrad and djorgovski ( 1984 ) , and firmly identified by dickinson ( 1995 ) . in dickinson",
    "s ( 1997b ) spectroscopic study , the surface - density excess was revealed to be due to the presence of two clusters or rich groups at @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "extended x - ray emission with a luminosity comparable to that of the coma cluster has been detected in the direction of 3c 324 ( dickinson 1997a ) , which suggests that at least one of the two systems is a collapsed massive system . from a deep hst image ,",
    "smail and dickinson ( 1995 ) detected a weak shear pattern in the field that may be produced by a cluster . in the following discussion",
    ", we do not distinguish the two clusters at @xmath12 , since either a detailed redshift distribution of the galaxies or the relative population of the two systems is not yet available .",
    "we thus discuss the average properties of the two clusters .",
    "since their redshifts are close to each other , this has little effect on our discussion about the luminosity and color distributions .",
    "the 3c 324 cluster has been studied by kajisawa et al .",
    "( 2000a , b ; hereinafter referred to as k00a , b ) with the hst @xmath24- and @xmath25-bands and the subaru @xmath7-band data , which we include in this analysis as well .",
    "k00a investigated the @xmath7-band luminosity distribution of galaxies around 3c 324 .",
    "they found an abrupt decrease in the @xmath7-band luminosity function for galaxies in the cluster core region ( @xmath26 from 3c 324 ) at @xmath27 , and suggested two possible interpretations , namely , luminosity segregation where a fraction of bright galaxies increases toward the cluster center , or the intrinsic deficiency of faint galaxies in the 3c 324 cluster .",
    "k00b also studied the optical and near - infrared color of @xmath7-selected galaxies in this cluster .",
    "they found a truncation of the color ",
    "magnitude sequence of the 3c 324 cluster at @xmath28 .",
    "they also argued that the bulge - dominated galaxies in the field seem to form a broad sequence in the color  magnitude diagram , whose slope at the faint end is much steeper than that expected from metallicity variations within a passively evolving coeval galaxy population .",
    "these results , however , are based on simple color selection or statistical background subtraction of the field galaxies , and can be affected by a contamination of the foreground / background objects .",
    "it is clearly needed to test them using a sample of galaxies that are more firmly identified as cluster members .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts are ideal , but not practical , at this high redshifts ( @xmath29 ) , since even with 2 hours of integration on an 8 m - class telescope , we can reach only down to @xmath30 . therefore , it is extremely time - consuming to make a complete sample over a representative field of distant clusters ( e.g. , 1  mpc ) . in this paper , we try to overcome this difficulty in identifying cluster membership by using a photometric - redshift technique .",
    "this approach enables us to investigate the galaxy properties of likely cluster members ; importantly , not only for the galaxies on the red sequence , but also for relatively blue galaxies , which are otherwise embedded in numerous field populations on a color  magnitude diagram . for this purpose",
    ", we newly obtained @xmath31 and @xmath32 data with suprime - cam at the cassegrain focus of the subaru telescope .",
    "firstly , we made a catalog of @xmath7-band selected objects .",
    "the use of a @xmath33-band sample has the following two advantages . first , the selection bias at large redshifts is small , and thus a direct comparison with lower - redshift clusters is possible ( aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "second , the sample selection is less affected by the star - formation activity .",
    "we applied a photometric - redshift technique by utilizing multi - band imaging data , and identified 35 objects as plausible cluster members . with this new cluster membership information as well as two additional colors essential for a population analysis",
    ", we revisited the issues which remain unsettled in k00a , b . with the photometric - redshift selected sample",
    ", we showed that an abrupt decrease in the faint end of the @xmath7-band luminosity function in the cluster core region shown in k00a , which is mainly because the fraction of faint members relative to the bright members is lower in the core region than in the whole cluster , i.e. , luminosity segregation ; we also found that k00a regarded some faint members as non - members .",
    "the truncation of the color ",
    "magnitude sequence , indicated in k00b , was clearly identified in this work as well . however ,",
    "the broad and tilted color  magnitude sequence argued in k00b is not completely recovered by the photometric - redshift selected sample used in this paper .",
    "in addition to these interesting results , we newly found a uv - excess in some early - type galaxies , and also derived the blue fraction of the 3c 324 cluster at @xmath12 .",

    "thus , a dark frame was created for each of the object frames , depending on the temperature of the dewar at the time when the frame was exposed .",
    "next , flatfielding was performed . because the @xmath31-band images suffered from stray light , the flat - field frame for the @xmath31-band was made from twilight sky frames in which the counts of stray light were negligible . for the @xmath32-band ,",

    "since the dome flat may not reflect the global pattern of the ccd sensitivity , we further corrected the @xmath32-band frame for the global sensitivity pattern .",
    "the sky flat frame was made by taking the median of the fringe - subtracted object frames .",
    "all of the object frames were flat - fielded again using this sky flat frame .",

( 2000 ) suggested two possibilities for interpreting these uv - excess galaxies : an intermittent star formation or the last stage of the tail of star formation . to examine these possibilities , we computed another burst model for which a star - burst component has a flatter imf ( @xmath176 ) than the salpeter imf ( @xmath177 ) .",

    "<S> we have found that red and luminous members are concentrated in a small region enclosed by a circle of 40@xmath2 radius ( 0.33 mpc at @xmath0 for @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 cosmology ) from the 3c 324 galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the 3c 324 cluster is probably much more compact in size compared with the local clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we constructed a @xmath7-band luminosity function of the cluster members and fit a schechter function , and found the characteristic magnitude to be @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is consistent with the extrapolation of the pure passive evolution seen for @xmath9 clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we have identified eight bright galaxies which form a red color  magnitude sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the sequence is consistent with the passive evolution model down to @xmath10 ; we also found that there is no clear age variation in these bright red galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> however , seven out of these eight galaxies exhibit a significant excess in the rest uv light with respect to the passive evolution model . </S>",
    "<S> this may suggest that the massive early - type galaxies in this high - redshift cluster are still forming stars to some extent . </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed a truncation of the color  </S>",
    "<S> magnitude sequence at @xmath11 ; faint passively - evolving galaxies may not yet be present in this cluster at @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the overall color distribution of the cluster members , selected by the photometric redshift technique , is found to be very broad . </S>",
    "<S> we derived the fraction of blue galaxies in this cluster following a definition of butcher and oemler ( 1984 ) , and obtained @xmath13 , which is higher than that for @xmath9 clusters . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the star - formation activity of this cluster is , on the average , higher than that of lower redshift counterparts . </S>"
