    "it has been shown that various observables of relativistic heavy - ion collisions can be well described by statistical - thermal or hydrodynamical models .",
    "in such a way , a selected subset of a large number of observables can be reproduced by a small number of characteristic parameters , such as temperature , density or flow velocity .",
    "it is the subject of the present note to pursue this idea and to analyze the centrality dependence of the thermal parameters describing hadron multiplicities , hadron spectra and dilepton spectra .",
    "this will provide further information about the effects of the size of the excited strongly interacting system and help in the systematic understanding of the experimental data .",
    "hadron multiplicities can be reproduced @xcite by the grand - canonical partition function @xmath3 $ ] , where @xmath4 is the statistical operator of the system , @xmath5 denotes the temperature , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the chemical potentials and corresponding conserved charges respectively .",

    "the final particle numbers are @xmath15 due to decays of unstable particles with branching ratios @xmath16 .",
    "such a description can be justified for multiplicities measured over the whole phase - space , since many dynamical effects cancel out in ratios of hadron yields .",
    "we have analyzed two data sets : ( i ) na49 @xmath17 multiplicities of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ( taken as the sum over all baryons ) in 6 centrality bins in the reaction pb(158 agev ) + pb @xcite ( it should be emphasized that protons are not included in our analysis @xcite as they are not participants in non - central collisions ) , and ( ii ) phenix mid - rapidity densities of @xmath23 , @xmath19 , and @xmath24 in the reaction au + au at @xmath25 agev in 5 centrality bins @xcite .",
    "results of our fits are displayed in fig .  1 .",

    "most remarkable is the drop of the baryo - chemical potential @xmath26 and the rise of the strangeness saturation factor @xmath9 when going from @xmath27 agev to 130 agev .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 is fairly independent of the centrality .",
    "@xmath5 seems to stay constant for @xmath27 agev , while at 130 agev it rises with @xmath22 .",
    "the strangeness saturation factor and , of course , the volume - equivalent system size increase significantly with centrality .",
    "( note the fiducial meaning of the volume for the mid - rapidity data of phenix . ) despite the rather limited set of analyzed hadron species , the extracted thermal parameters describe other hadron yields , which are at our disposal in central collisions , fairly well .",

    "for the reaction pb(158 agev ) + pb , transverse momentum spectra at mid - rapidity are available also in 6 centrality bins @xcite",
    ". however , the raw data analysis in @xcite needs refinements and cross checks .",
    "we , therefore , mention here only that our preliminary analysis along the lines in @xcite seems to point to a larger transverse flow with increasing centrality .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the dilepton spectra can be analyzed in the same spirit as the hadron multiplicities and hadron momentum spectra , i.e. , one discards any detail of the dynamics and asks only for a simple parameterization . as a result , one gets for the thermal dilepton spectrum @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the lepton pair s four - momentum , @xmath30 its transverse mass and @xmath31 its rapidity ; @xmath32 denotes the fire ball rapidity , and @xmath33 is a normalization factor characterizing the space - time volume of the fire ball ; flow effects are negligible for invariant mass spectra . in @xcite",
    "we have shown that the space - time averaged temperature parameter @xmath34 mev ( i.e. , a value coinciding with the chemical freeze - out temperature ) provides a description of the low - mass ceres data and the intermediate - mass na50 data at @xmath27 agev ; also the wa98 photon data are consistent with this value .",
    "it was , therefore , a surprise to us that our analysis of the efficiency corrected and centrality binned na50 data @xcite give as optimum fit a temperature scale in the order of 250 mev , in bins 1 and 2 ( very peripheral collisions ) deviates from this value .",
    "the extracted values are not safe and depend sensitively on the normalization of the drell - yan yield . ]",
    "see figs .  3 and 4 .",
    "at this temperature the spectral shapes of thermal dileptons and dileptons from correlated decays of open charm mesons are nearly identical within the na50 acceptance .",
    "we have also checked the temperature sensitivity of the parameterization eq .",
