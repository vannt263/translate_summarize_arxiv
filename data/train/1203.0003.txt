    "-0.6truecm    kocevsky 2012 ( k12 , hereafter ) performed a population study finding that the  correlation is induced by a combination of the redshift / luminosity function of grbs with the detection limit of a given instrument (  in his study ) .",
    "k12 attributes the existence of the  correlation to the combination of the malmquist bias ( i.e. the detection of the most luminous grbs at high @xmath5 preferentially ) , the flux limit of the detector , and its limited band  pass . according to this interpretation the most luminous grbs at high @xmath5 with intermediate   goes undetected because their = /@xmath51 falls below the low energy threshold of the detector ( i.e. 15 kev in the case of bat ) .",
    "this argument is intuitively plausible : a detector sensitive in a given energy range should hardly detect bursts with  outside this range .",
    "however , what matters for triggering a burst is its peak flux ( integrated in the detector energy range ) which depends on the spectral shape of the burst ( e.g. , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) and the normalization of the spectrum .",
    "if this flux is larger than the detector flux limit , the burst will be detected no matter its .",

    "our population synthesis code is simpler than that of k12 because we test the   correlation through the complete  sample . in our case , by simulating @xmath5 ,  and   we can immediately compute the peak flux of a simulated grb and compare it with the flux limit .",
    "the simulation of k12 concerns the  correlation , which involves the time integrated spectral properties of grbs , and requires several assumptions ( e.g. on the profile structure and time evolution of the spectrum during a burst ) in order to simulate a grb light curve and verify if it can be detected by  ( in turn , this also requires k12 to model a typical background and the  detector response matrix ) .",

    "limit of the s12 sample is sufficiently high that the selected sample should be free from these trigger  related issues .",
    "if we make the hypothesis that there is no correlation between  and , only in 7.3% of the repeated simulations ( e.g. for the case of a grb population evolving in density with redshift , as found in s12 ) we find a statistically robust ( i.e. chance probability of the rank correlation coefficient @xmath59 )  correlation . if we also require that our simulations produce a correlation similar ( in slope , normalization and scatter ) to that observed among real grbs of the complete  sample , the percentage reduces to 0.7% .",
    "therefore , we reject the null hypothesis that there is not an intrinsic  correlation at the 2.7@xmath0 level of confidence ( 3.0@xmath0 for the case of luminosity evolution ) .",
    "these results suggest that a correlation between  and  should exist .",
    "since for  we have considered a bright cut on the peak flux ( to match that adopted in the definition of the complete sample of s12 ) , our results are obtained for the most conservative case .",
    "similar results , i.e. the impossibility to produce a strong  correlation as due to the trigger threshold , are also obtained for .",
    "an alternative possibility is that there is a boundary in the  plane ( nakar & piran 2005 ) .",
    "if we assume that this boundary is coincident with the observed  correlation , the scatter of the data points around it is not symmetric but there is a larger fraction of bursts with intermediate  and low luminosities .",
    "the trigger threshold here could play a role in hiding the events with extremely low luminosity .",
    "our simulations , assuming the existence of the  correlation as a boundary , suggest that while a considerable percentage ( 87% ) of simulations produce a significant correlation in the  plane , only 12% of the simulations also produce a correlation with slope , normalization and scatter consistent with that of the real grb sample .",
    "this result excludes at the 1.6@xmath0 confidence level the boundary case , as we have modeled it here .",
    "in particular , we assumed that the distribution of bursts above the boundary is uniform .",
    "it could still be possible , however , that a boundary with an asymmetric scatter below and above it exists due to some other property of grbs ( e.g. their jet opening angle ) .",
    "this possibility requires more elaborated simulations that are outside the scope of this paper . in conclusion ,",
    "our simulations show that there is a correlation between  and  and this can not be due to a selection bias caused by a flux  limited sample .",
