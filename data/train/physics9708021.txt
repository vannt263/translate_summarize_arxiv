    "a key issue which has emerged in describing electronic transitions in the condensed phase is the proper treatment of the short - lived phase coherence of the electronic and nuclear ( bath ) wavefunction .",
    "the essence of the effect becomes clear if one considers the behavior of an electronic quantum system in a classical bath .",
    "in such a mixed quantum - classical system , the classical dynamics of the bath nuclei follow along a given adiabatic potential surface associated with one of the eigenstates of the electronic hamiltonian .",
    "thus the potential felt by the nuclear degrees of freedom will depend strongly upon the quantum state of the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the fundamental distinction between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics is that a quantum system can evolve into a coherent linear superposition of states .",
    "this leads to a rather profound ambiguity in describing the forces between the quantum and classical subsystems .",
    "furthermore , quantum mechanics forces us to consider the effect of all alternative histories or pathways , including those of the classical bath , when computing quantum transition probabilities .",
    "thus , as the electronic wavefunction evolves from an initially pure eigenstate to a coherent superposition of eigenstates , various alternative pathways for the bath particles begin to emerge , each associated with dynamics starting from an initial nuclear configuration and electronic state and ending in a different final nuclear configuration and final electronic eigenstate . as the nuclear dynamics for the different quantum ( electronic ) states diverge , phase coherence between the alternative histories",
    "is lost due to the increasing differences between the classical actions associated with each alternative nuclear path .",
    "this effect is known as quantum decoherence .",
    "@xcite    because quantum decoherence acts to suppress the formation of superposition states , it diminishes profoundly the transition probability between quantum states coupled by the nuclear dynamics . when the loss of quantum phase coherence between the electronic states is neglected and no longer enters directly into the computation of making an electronic transition , which is a typical approximation made in mixed quantum - classical treatments",
    ", one can show that the result will be an incorrect estimation of the transition probabilities and other associated physical observables.@xcite because of the tremendous utility of mixed - quantum classical treatments in simulating condensed phase phenomena , it is of tantamount importance to be able to properly incorporate the effects of quantum decoherence into these simulations .",
    "recently , we have presented a theory of quantum decoherence which is suitable for condensed phase quantum molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "@xcite this approach is based upon a interpretation of quantum mechanics introduced by griffiths  @xcite , omns  @xcite , and gell - mann and hartle  @xcite over roughly the past 10 years .",
    "this interpretation of quantum mechanics , termed `` consistent '' or `` decoherent '' histories , has generated a great deal of attention in the field of quantum cosmology.@xcite we have also applied and extended the formalism to study coherence effects in physically realistic condensed phase problems  @xcite .",
    "this work has lead to a number of advances in designing computational algorithms which incorporate a consistent description of quantum decoherence and to a deeper understanding of the role that quantum decoherence plays in condensed phase chemical processes and molecular level descriptions of the decoherence process .",
    "@xcite these theoretical advances have also offered a tangible solution to a specific long standing puzzle regarding the solvent isotope effect on the non - radiative lifetime of an excess electron in 2o and 2o and offer a plausible explanation of the lack of an observed solvent isotope effect.@xcite    in this paper , we give the details of our computational algorithm based upon consistent quantum histories and its application in a full scale quantum molecular dynamics simulation of the relaxation of an excited excess electron in 2o .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper represent the first application of the bittner - rossky decoherence theory in a full scale simulation of a condensed phase system .",
    "the aqueous electron provides perhaps the simplest example of electronic dynamics in the condensed phase . at the same time , aqueous electrons are of particular importance since they play a prominent role in the broad area of radiation chemistry of water . in spite of intensive experimental and theoretical study since identification of the hydrated electron over 30 years ago ,",
    "many dynamical features of electron solvation have remained incompletely understood , largely due to the extremely fast time scales on which electronic relaxation occurs.@xcite newly developed femtosecond spectroscopic techniques are now providing glimpses of the details of condensed phase electronic dynamics . from a theoretical standpoint ,",
    "the aqueous electron is an ideal test case for new condensed phase theories .",
    "recent theoretical advances in treating condensed phase electronic dynamics  @xcite has led to an exceptional interplay between theory and experiment , helping to unravel many subtle dynamical aspects of this system .",
    "the remainder of this paper proceeds as follows : in the next section we review the consistent histories methodology as it applies toward developing a computational algorithm for condensed phase simulations .",
    "we then give the results of quantum md simulations of the non - adiabatic relaxation dynamics of an excited excess aqueous electron which employ the consistent histories algorithm and compare the present results to previous estimates of the non - adiabatic electronic transition rate by schwartz , bittner , prezhdo , and rossky ( sbpr )  @xcite , to earlier results presented by schwartz and rossky which employed a constant 1 fs coherence time scale throughout,@xcite as well as to the experimental data of kimura  .",

    "along the course of this path , we determine at various time intervals whether or not a quantum transition has occurred according to a stochastic switching criteria and modifying the classical dynamics accordingly .",
    "the fundimental notion of having classical particles switch between discrete quantum states was originally pioneered by tully  @xcite in the early 1970 s .",
    "subsequently , various computational schemes have been developed which incorporate quantum switching into the classical dynamics and improve upon tully s original idea .",
    "most notably are the stationary phase surface hopping algorithms developed by webster , friesner , and rossky  @xcite and further by coker and co - workers  @xcite , as well as the molecular dynamics with quantum transitions algorithm of tully and co - workers  @xcite .",
    "the classical switching path contains a record of the outcome of each switching attempt and can thus be written as a time ordered sequence of events , @xmath5 the superscript @xmath6 denotes the switching outcome at time - step @xmath7 and @xmath8 corresponding to our choice of the initial quantum state .",

    "according to this last equation , the transition probability for the quantum subsystem is dependent upon interferences between the various alternative pairs of switching pathways .",
    "thus , in order to correctly compute the populations of the electronic states at some later time , one must perform a sum over all alternative paths that the bath can take . in a practical sense",
    ", this amounts to launching a swarm of trajectories from each initial starting point and computing the switching probabilities ( i.e. branching ratios for the swarm ) using eq .",
    "[ eq : prob ] . however , this approach has the distinct disadvantage that one must initialize a large enough swarm of trajectories in order to effectively sample the distribution of switching paths originating from each initial configuration .",

    "[ eq : prob ] directly for a large number of classical variables is prohibitive .",
    "next , we present an alternative derivation of the quantum survival and transition probabilities which uses only a single switching path explicitly .",
    "the formalism is motivated by the observation that at short times , there will be a significant contribution from the phase interferences between two alternative paths with similar histories , necessitating a coherent sum over paths , while at longer times the action difference between two paths will become very large and phase interference effects from alternative paths will become negligible .",

    "coarse grained histories can be assigned probabilities , that is , integrating over coarse grained histories is equivalent to integrating over probabilities .",
    "coarse graining of histories arises naturally whenever we try to mix quantum with classical dynamics .",

    "consequently , transition probabilities are computed by first integrating coherently over the fine grained sets of paths to get the transition amplitude say along one classical switching path , then summing incoherently ( i.e. adding as ordinary probabilities ) over coarse grained sets .",
    "quantum decoherence effects can be consistently incorporated into mixed quantum - classical systems by recognizing that restricting the quantum evolution to given classical pathways is equivalent to making a series of quantum measurements on the total system .",

    "the simulation continued until a switch from the excited state to the ground state was recorded . immediately after the switch , the energy gap between the occupied ground state and the first excited state widened dramatically as the solvent responded to the new electronic state .",
    "the average and median switching times from these simulations are compiled in table 1 .    in order to test the sensitivity of the switching times to the choice of sequence of coherence intervals ,",
    "five configurations were `` recycled '' by using different random number sequences for the coherence time intervals to generate different switching paths starting from the same initial configuration . for each such pairs of paths , the classical dynamics were identical up until the earlier switching time when one of the paths switched from the excited state to the ground state . however , since the coherences between the different quantum states were killed off at randomly different times for each path , each path sampled a different probability distribution function for making a switch at each md time step . hence any correlations between switching times resulting using the same initial configuration reflect correlations in the distribution of coherence time intervals . given that there is typically a 100 fs time difference between pairs of data ( in one case a 530 fs difference ) which is roughly 1/3 of the average survival time scale of the excited state , we find very little correlation between the switching times originating from the same initial configuration .",
    "the excited state survival probability reflects not only the probability of making a transition from the excited state to the ground state , it also reflects the solvation dynamics of the non - equilibrium excited state following its preparation .",
    "initially , the energy gap between the excited and ground state is very wide and a non - adiabatic transition between the states is highly unlikely .",
    "however at later times , after the excited state has begun to be solvated by the surrounding water molecules , the energy gap closes considerably and nonadiabatic transitions become more likely .",
    "the solvation dynamics of this system have been extensively studied previously by schwartz and rossky.@xcite their results for the solvation response , defined as the normalized autocorrelation of the energy gap between the ground and excited states , indicates a rapid 24 fs initial gaussian component which makes up roughly 40% of the response followed by a longer time 240 fs exponential decay which makes up most of the remainder .    as the excited state",
    "is solvated by the surrounding water molecules , the energy gap between the excited state and the ground state narrows to its equilibrium value . furthermore , from first order perturbation theory , we expect that the electronic transition rate to be inversely proportional to the magnitude of the energy difference between initial and final states .",
    "thus , a simple model for the excited state survival probability can be written @xmath58 subject to the initial condition @xmath59 . here , @xmath60 is the non - adiabatic transition rate for the solvated excited state and @xmath61 is the average energy gap normalized to the average energy gap of the solvated excited state .",

    "this comes as no surprise since our inclusion of quantum coherence effects does not effect the computation of the interaction forces between the excited electron and the water molecules . at short times ,",
    "when @xmath69 , the nonadiabatic transition rate will be small since the energy gap is large . at long times @xmath70 as the energy gap relaxes to its equilibrium value .",

    "[ fig : swtimes ] . interestingly enough , our data does not fit this simple model as nicely as the data given by schwartz and rossky.@xcite this suggests that the longer coherence times used in this study imparts a non - trivial memory dependency into the survival probability which is inadequately captured in eq .

    "in this paper we have briefly described the results of our work towards a molecular level description of quantum relaxation phenomena .",
    "here we have focused exclusively upon the role that transient quantum mechanical coherences between the solvent and the solute play in the electronic relaxation of an excited solute species . in mixed quantum - classical computer simulations , fundamental assumptions about the decay of these coherences",
    "produce direct manifestations on the computed quantum mechanical transition rates and must be included consistently in order to make realistic predictions and comparisons.@xcite    the computational algorithm , based upon the so - called consistent histories interpretation of quantum mechanics , provides both the molecular level underpinnings of quantum decoherence and the computational means for properly including decoherence effects in non - adiabatic quantum - molecular dynamics simulations . according to the rules of ordinary quantum mechanics , a quantum system will evolve into a coherent superposition of alternative states . in our decoherence theory ,",
    "this coherence is dissipated due to the differences in the forces exerted on the bath by alternative states involved in the superposition .",
    "thus , on short scales , a quantum system in a bath will obey the rules of ordinary quantum mechanics and evolve into a coherent superposition of states , whereas on longer time scales , the coherences between states are diminished and the quantum system must be described as statistical ( i.e. incoherent ) mixture of states . as the quantum system interacts continuously with the bath ,",
    "coherences between states are continuously created by non - adiabatic coupling and damped by the divergence in the bath dynamics induced by the system - bath coupling .",
    "this subtle interplay between coupling and decoherence and the subsequent dependency of transition rates on the decoherence time scale has profound implications for a variety of condensed phase chemical dynamics including : internal conversion and internal vibrational energy redistribution ( in which the bath is comprised of all the modes of the molecules except for the one mode of interest ) , electronic energy transfer between molecules or different parts of the same molecule , and charge transfer reactions including proton and electron transfer . in these latter examples , both the condensed phase environment and",
    "the internal motions of the molecules act as a bath which couples the quantum states together .",
    "the decay of quantum coherence , which depends upon the frequencies and populations of the bath modes coupled to the quantum system will determine the extent to which the non - adiabatic coupling can act to allow the chemical reaction to proceed .",
    "changes in the spectral density due to isotopic changes in the bath can have a substantial impact on non - adiabatic chemical dynamics.@xcite furthermore , the decay of quantum coherence can determine the adiabaticity for a chemical reaction .",
    "perhaps the two major lacunae in our present theory is the explicit dependency upon an _ a priori _ estimate of the coherence time scale and the fact that this time scale remains fixed throughout the calculation . as mentioned above , we estimated this time scale by computing the average decay time of the overlap of a product of gaussian coherent states evolving on different adiabatic potential energy surfaces . in this estimate , the individual widths of the coherent state wavefunctions centered about the initial phase space points of the classical nuclei are set to be proportional to the thermal debroglie wavelength of each nuclei .",
    "although physically realistic for a variety of situations , this does leave the coherence _ length scale _",
    "( i.e. the widths ) as an adjustable parameter .",
    "while the effects of changing the coherence length scale over a broad range have not been systematically studied , results from our previous work demonstrate that the non - adiabatic transition is quite sensitive to changes in the coherence time scale and hence will be sensitive to changes in the coherence length scales .",
    "furthermore , as the bath explores various regions of the quantum potential energy surface , the force differences which give rise to the decay of the quantum coherences  @xcite should vary from one configuration to the next .",

    "<S> this theory , which is based upon the consistent histories interpretation of quantum mechanics , introduces decoherence in the quantum subsystem by carefully considering the relevant time and length scales over which one must consider the effects of phase interference between alternative histories of the classical subsystem . </S>",
    "<S> such alternative histories are an integral part of any quantum - classical computational scheme which employ transitions between discrete quantum states ; consequently , the coherences between alternative histories have a profound effect on the transition probability between quantum states . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we review the bittner - rossky theory and detail a computational algorithm suitable for large - scale quantum molecular dynamics simulations which implements this theory . </S>",
