    "one - dimensional driven diffusive systems have provided a rich frame - work for the study of many interesting phenomena such as phase transitions , shock structures and the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance in the context of the non - equilibrium statistical mechanics [ 1 - 4 ] . moreover , from the mathematical point of view , some of them are related to the integrable quantum chain hamiltonians and can be mapped to the other non - equilibrium models , for instance , interface growth and traffic flows [ 5,6 ] .",
    "+ in this paper , we study a recently introduced exclusion model which exhibits both phase transition and spatial condensation of particles [ 8,9 ] . in this model",
    "two types of particles , called @xmath9 and @xmath10 , occupy the sites of a periodic one - dimensional lattice of length @xmath11 .",
    "the particles are subjected to hard - core exclusion , so that there are three possible states at each site : empty , occupied by a positive particle , or by a negative one .",
    "the positive ( negative ) particles hop to their immediate right ( left ) site with rate @xmath0 provided that it is empty .",
    "adjacent positive and negative particles also exchange their positions with asymmetric rates @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , during the infinitesimal time step @xmath12 , any bond @xmath13 @xmath14with @xmath15 evolves as follows : @xmath16 with periodic boundary conditions , the stationary state of this model has been studied by monte - carlo simulation , mean - field approximation , and recently using analytical approaches in the neutral case in which the density of the positive and negative particles are equal [ 8 - 11 ] .",
    "it has been shown that in the neutral case the model possesses two different phases depending on the reaction rate @xmath1 [ 10 ] , in contrast to the analytical results of [ 11 ] which indicate that there is no such a transition .",
    "this model has also been studied with open boundaries in two special limits [ 12 ] .",
    "+ here we study this model in the charged case in which a finite density of positive particles @xmath2 and only one negative particle are present on the ring . using the matrix product anstaz ( mpa ) formalism first introduced in [ 7 ] , we can derive the exact analytic expression for the partition function of this model .",
    "exact calculations show that in the limit of infinite system size and infinite number of positive particles the model has two different phases for @xmath17 , and the transition point @xmath18 depends on the density of the positive particles .",
    "exact expressions for the speed of the positive and negative particles can also be computed in this limit .",
    "we will see that these expressions have different behaviours depending on the value of @xmath1 . for @xmath4 , the speed of the positive and negative particles , as a function of @xmath1 , increase linearly with @xmath1 from zero .",
    "however , for @xmath19 the speed of the positive particles remains constant while the speed of the negative particle still increases as a function of both @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the speed of particles as a function of @xmath1 is continuous at the transition point although its derivative changes discontinuously at this point .",
    "also for @xmath6 it turns out that the density profile of the positive particles has an exponential behaviour with a characteristic length @xmath20 , while the system presents a shock , i.e. a sharp discontinuity between a region of high density of particles and a region of low density for @xmath4 . at the transition point",
    "the correlation length diverges and the model shows a second order phase transition .",
    "we will show that at @xmath7 the stationary probability of all possible configurations become equal . at this point",
    "no correlation exists and mean - field results are exact [ 8 ] .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows . in the section 2 ,",
    "we obtain the exact expression for the canonical partition function of the model using the mpa . in section 3 , we derive exact expressions for the speed of both kinds of particles , and also for the density profile of the positive particles on the ring . in the last section",
    "we compare our results with those obtained from the neutral case .",
    "according to the mpa formalism [ 7 ] , the stationary probability distribution @xmath21 of any configuration @xmath22 can be expressed as a trace of a product of non - commuting operators .",
    "for the model proposed here we assume that there are @xmath23 positive particles and only one negative particle on a ring on length @xmath11 .",
    "since this model is translationally invariant , we can always keep the single negative particle at site @xmath11 and write the normalized stationary probability distribution as @xmath24 where @xmath25 if the site @xmath26 is occupied by a positive particle and @xmath27 if it is empty .",
    "the matrices @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 which stand for the presence of a positive , negative particle , and a hole satisfy the following algebra introduced in [ 10 ] @xmath31 the normalization factor @xmath32 , which plays the role analogous to the partition function in equilibrium statistical mechanics , ensures that @xmath33 and can be written as a trace @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the kronecker @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , the expression ( 2 ) is a conditional probability distribution which gives the probability of finding configuration @xmath22 in the stationary state provided that a negative particles exists at site @xmath11 .",
    "we will see that all the physical quantities such as the speed of particles and the density profile of the positive particles can be written in terms of @xmath32 .",
    "it can easily be checked that a one - dimensional representation of the algebra ( 3 - 5 ) exists @xmath37 for @xmath7 [ 8 ] . in this case",
    "( as can be seen from ( 2 ) ) all configurations of the system occur with equal probabilities @xmath38 and no correlation exists .",
    "it implies that at @xmath7 the mean - field results are exact .",
    "we will see that in this case @xmath32 is equal to the total number of all possible configurations of the system .",
    "traditionally , one has to find the representations of the algebra appears in mpa formalism and use it to calculate both the partition function and physical quantities .",
    "but in this paper we show that ( see appendix ) the expression ( 6 ) can be calculated directly using the algebra ( 3 - 5 ) and has a closed form @xmath39 in which @xmath40 is the binomial coefficient . at @xmath7",
    "we have @xmath41 which is nothing except the total number of possible configurations of the model .",
    "in the stationary state , the speed of the positive particles in the reference frame of the lattice is found to be ( see appendix ) @xmath42 similarly , the speed of the negative particle in the reference frame of the lattice can be obtained ( see appendix ) @xmath43    in figures 1 and 2 we have plotted @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , computed from the exact expressions ( 8) and ( 9 ) as a function of @xmath1 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 . as can be seen the behaviour of these functions changes near @xmath3 .",
    "however , we should take the limit @xmath48 and @xmath49 being fixed ) to find the exact transition point .",
    "we use the steepest descent method for computing the transition point . at this limit the asymptotic behaviours of ( 8) and ( 9 ) are given by @xmath50 @xmath51 thus , the transition point is exactly found to be @xmath3 .",
    "now it is obvious that for @xmath8 no phase transition can take place because of the restriction on the density @xmath52 .",
    "+ to study the nature of these phases we can compute the density profile of the positive particles on the ring .",
    "the average density of the positive particles @xmath53 at the distance @xmath54 from the negative particle is equal to the probability of finding a positive particle at site @xmath55 . using the same procedure proposed in the appendix",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath56 where @xmath57 as can be seen from ( 12 ) the density profile of positively charged particles is completely flat at @xmath7 . in what follows we study the density profile ( 12 ) in the thermodynamic limit .      in this phase ,",
    "as can be seen from figure 3 , the negative particle has a short - range effect on the system .",
    "the density profile starts from @xmath59 just in front of the negative particle and decreases exponentially to its bulk value @xmath2 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of formula ( 12 ) in the limit @xmath60 and @xmath49 being fixed ) is given by @xmath61 in which @xmath20 specifies the disturbance due to the existence of the negative particle .      in this domain",
    ", the negative particle provokes a macroscopic shock in the system , as can be seen in the figure 4 .",
    "a high density region @xmath63 extending from @xmath64 to @xmath65 is separated by a sharp interface from a region of low density @xmath66 extending from @xmath65 to @xmath67 .",
    "the position of the shock @xmath68 can be obtained from the thermodynamic behaviour of ( 12 ) in this region @xmath69",
    "in this paper we investigated a recently introduced model [ 8,9 ] in the special limit of infinite system size and infinite number of positively charged particles in the presence of one negative particle . in this limit",
    ", the model shows both phase transition and spatial condensation of particles in one - dimension .",
    "the phase transition takes place at @xmath3 , between a power - law and a jammed phase .",
    "the speed of the positive and the negative particles are not differentiable at the transition point @xmath3 . in the neutral case , when the density of the positive and negative particles are equal , the model shows a first order phase transition at @xmath70 , where the density of particles as a function of fugacity has a finite jump [ 8,10 ] .",
    "very recently it has been shown that the transition point can be determined , with great accuracy , using yang - lee theory in the non - equilibrium context [ 10 ] . in [ 10 ] the author presents a numerical study , using the grand canonical ensemble , but in contrast to the original yang - lee paper does not give a proof of the existence or nonexistence of the phase transition . although it was claimed that neither in the frame - work of a grand canonical nor canonical ensemble such transition exists [ 11 ] .",
    "our exact calculations admit that in the limit @xmath48 and @xmath49 being fixed ) the phase transition exists and in comparison to the neutral case [ 8 ] the transition point is shifted . in",
    "the neutral case the current of both positive and negative particles is zero for @xmath71 where the particle segregation exists . here ,",
    "as can be seen from figures 1 and 2 , the speed of particles never drops to zero for @xmath72 . in our model",
    "the presence of a single negative particle produces a macroscopic shock for @xmath4 . in the power - law phase @xmath6 the density profile of positive particles has an exponential behaviour with correlation length @xmath5 which diverges at the transition point .",
    "this implies a second order phase transition at this point .",
    "+ the next step could be analytical study of this model with unequal but finite densities of positive @xmath73 and negative particles @xmath74 .",
    "an approach can be considering the model with open boundaries where the injection and extraction rates control the bulk density .",
    "work in this direction is in progress [ 12 ] . +",
    "* appendix : formulas for @xmath32 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 * + in the following we show that the normalization factor @xmath32 can be calculated directly using the algebra ( 3 - 5 ) . first , we note that one can split ( 6 ) in two terms as @xmath75 now using ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) it is not difficult to see that ( 15 ) can be written as @xmath76 this can be done by noting that the first term in ( 15 ) can be written as @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 which gives the first term in ( 16 )",
    ". one can expand the second term in ( 16 ) repeatedly as follows @xmath80 @xmath81 to obtain the following compact formula for the partition function @xmath82 the expression ( 17 ) can easily be calculated using the algebra ( 3 - 5 ) @xmath83 solving the above difference equation gives @xmath84 since @xmath32 enters to both denominator and numerator of physical quantities , the same common factor @xmath85 cancels from all formulas so the results are independent of its value . for simplicity",
    "we set @xmath86 .",
