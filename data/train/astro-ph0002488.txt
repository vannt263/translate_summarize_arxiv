    "although microturbulence is a fundamental parameter when deriving abundances from stellar spectra , it has been systematically ignored when deriving he abundances from quantitative spectroscopical nlte analyses of ob stars ( herrero et al .",
    "@xcite , smith & howarth ) , being the first exceptions to this the works by mcerlean et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and smith & howarth ( ) .",
    "one of the main reasons to ignore it is that the use of nlte techniques reduced the need of microturbulence for the reproduction of the observed metallic line strengths and they even made abundances less sensitive to the value adopted for microturbulence than in lte analyses ( becker & butler ) .    in quantitative nlte analyses of ob stars , the lines of h and",
    "he are used to determine stellar parameters ( namely , effective temperature , @xmath0 , logarithmic surface gravity , @xmath1 , and he abundance ) .",
    "their line profiles are dominated by the stark broadening , and microturbulence , included in the standard way , only adds an extra doppler width to the thermal broadening .",
    "first values for microturbulence found in lte for main sequence b stars , of the order of 5 kms@xmath3 ( hardorp & scholz ) , showed to be small enough to be of no importance when compared to h and he thermal velocities , that in such hot atmospheres are well above 5 kms@xmath3 .",
    "this together with the use of nlte made the influence of microturbulence in the overall profile seem negligible .    when measuring microturbulence in ob supergiants the situation is quite different , as its value has always showed to be comparable or well above the thermal velocities of h and he , and even , in some cases , above the speed of sound in these atmospheres ( lamers @xcite , lennon & dufton ) .",
    "this was not changed by later nlte analyses ( lennon et al .",
    "@xcite , hubeny et al .",
    "@xcite , gies & lambert , smartt et al .",
    "@xcite ) , in which the values of microturbulence obtained are usually reduced but never to values clearly without contradiction .",
    "kudritzki ( @xcite ) and lamers & achmad ( ) explained that this could be due to the presence of wind outflow in these stars , that can mimic the effect of microturbulence in the line profiles .",
    "most of the previously referred works are on early b and late o supergiants .",
    "little work has been done on early o stars ( see hubeny et al .",
    "@xcite ) , mainly because for them , with scarce metallic lines , it is very difficult to measure the value of microturbulence . and",
    "it is in the whole range of o stars that we are interested .",
    "one problem that is systematically found in all analyses of ob spectra is the imposibility of finding a consistent fit of all lines with a unique set of parameters .",
    "this difficulty appears worse in supergiants than in main sequence stars , and it is bigger between results from singlet and from triplet lines , but also appears within different lines in one system .",
    "we call this the _ lines problem_.    this discrepancy between singlet and triplet lines of was investigated by voels et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who considered that atmospheric extension was responsible and so they called this effect `` generalized dilution effect '' .",
    "but recent works with spherical , mass losing models show that this can not be the only reason ( herrero et al . ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) . furthermore ,",
    "mcerlean et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and smith & howarth ( ) find that the inclusion of microturbulence in the line formation calculations reduces , although not to all its extent , the discrepancy between the fits of singlet and triplet lines .",
    "they also find better and more consistent fits for the whole set of lines when microturbulence is considered .",
    "one more reason that encourages us to study the effect of microturbulence is that a careful inspection of several works shows that even for main sequence stars , values of microturbulence comparable to the thermal velocities of at least he are obtained in nlte ( gies & lambert , kilian et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which can invalidate the hypothesis of negligible influence of microturbulence in the profiles .",
    "so in this paper we want to study microturbulence in the range of parameters typical for o stars of any luminosity class , specifically pointing to its effect on the determination of stellar parameters and also on the _ lines problem_. we are specially interested in investigating whether the inclusion of microturbulence can solve the _ he discrepancy _",
    "( herrero et al .",
    "@xcite ) , as vrancken ( @xcite ) , mcerlean et al . ( @xcite ) and smith & howarth ( ) suggest .",
    "this now well known problem has induced a lot of theoretical improvements in both evolutionary and model atmosphere theories in order to explain it .",
    "recent works including sphericity and mass loss in the spectral analysis ( herrero et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , israelian et al .",
    "@xcite ) show that with these new models , more suitable for these stars than the plane  parallel hydrostatic ones , the discrepancy is not solved .",
    "evolutionary models including additional mixing inside the star can explain enhanced he photospheric abundances during the h - burning phase , this mixing being induced by different physical mechanisms like rotation and turbulent diffusion ( dennisenkov , @xcite , meynet & maeder , , maeder & zahn , ) , or turbulent diffusion and semiconvection ( langer @xcite ) .",
    "sometimes angular rotational velocity changes during evolution are included ( langer & heger , @xcite , heger , @xcite ) .",
    "for a recent review , see maeder & meynet ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore it becomes of great importance to see whether microturbulence can be responsible for the _ he discrepancy_.    in sect .",
    "2 we present line formation calculations of h and he lines and their behaviour with microturbulence in the o stars domain . in sect . 3 we determine the effect of including microturbulence in the determination of stellar parameters , and in sect .",
    "4 we analyze some stars with and without considering microturbulence .",
    "sections 5 and 6 are then dedicated to our discussion and conclusions , respectively .",
    "in order to study the behaviour of h and he lines with microturbulence , we perform line formation calculations in the parameter range typical for o to early b stars of any luminosity class :    between 30000 and 45000 k in @xmath0    between 3.05 and 4.00 in @xmath1 ( in c.g.s . units )    for @xmath4= 0.10 and 0.20 , with @xmath5    where n(x ) is the number density of atom x. we follow the classical technique of calculating a nlte model atmosphere of h and he , in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium and with plane  parallel geometry ( calculated with ali , see kunze , @xcite ) , and then solve the statistical equilibrium and transfer equations and perform the formal solution for the lines of h and he chosen using detail & surface ( butler & giddings ) . in this final step",
    "we have included uv metal line opacities in the calculations , in order to obtain more realistic profiles ( see herrero , @xcite , and herrero et al . , @xcite , for details ) .",
    "as shown in the last reference , plane ",
    "parallel models are unable to reproduce properly spectra of massive ob stars around 50000 k and hotter , that is why we stop our study at 45000k .    microturbulence is introduced in the standard way , by adding an extra doppler width to the thermal broadening of the line , which is then convolved with the rest of the broadening mechanisms .",
    "we have considered it in both the equations of statistical equilibrium and radiative transfer . as we do nt consider other motions ( turbulent or not ) in the determination of the stellar structure , we prefer to restrict the introduction of microturbulence to the absorption coefficient .",
    "therefore , we do not include it in the calculation of the structure of the atmosphere via turbulent pressure . for similar reasons",
    "also we do not even bother about its dependence on depth .",
    "we do nt treat separately the effect on the populations and line profiles , as this has been recently studied by mcerlean et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and smith & howarth ( ) ( whose results we support ) .",
    "we make line formation calculations for the lines we usually consider to perform our analyses : h@xmath6 and h@xmath7 for ; @xmath2@xmath2 4387 , 4922 , 4471    for ; and @xmath2@xmath2 4200 , 4541 , 4686    for .    in order to study the behaviour of these lines with microturbulence",
    ", we perform line formation calculations for microturbulence velocity values from 0 to 20 kms@xmath3 , for different sets of parameters , representing the spectral types and luminosity classes we are interested in :     @xmath0= 30000 , @xmath1= 3.05 , @xmath4= 0.10 for late o and early b supergiants . the same with @xmath1= 4.00 for dwarfs .    ",
    "@xmath0= 35000 , @xmath1= 3.20 , @xmath4= 0.10 for `` middle '' o supergiants .",
    "the same with @xmath1= 4.00 for dwarfs .    ",
    "@xmath0= 40000 , @xmath1= 3.40 , @xmath4= 0.10 for early o supergiants .",
    "the same with @xmath1= 4.00 for dwarfs .    ",
    "@xmath0= 45000 , @xmath1= 3.60 , @xmath4= 0.10 for very early o supergiants .",
    "the same with @xmath1= 4.00 for dwarfs .",
    "the values of @xmath1 for supergiants are close to the lowest that could be converged for every @xmath0 . for dwarfs of increasing @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath1 becomes a little below 4.00 , but this value still represents well this luminosity class .",
    "finally , these calculations were repeated for @xmath4= 0.20 , to look for differential effects with he abundance .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     comparisons in table [ tab5 ] have to be done with care .",
    "it mixes results from different authors and different criteria .",
    "we see however that it indicates that the changes found here are consistent with those of other authors , i.e. , stellar parameters are changed within the uncertainties adopted here .",
    "these changes do not follow a clear , systematic pattern ( i.e. , going always in the same direction when introducing microturbulence ) and thus we conclude that the effect of microturbulence is indeed not larger than present  day uncertainties .",
    "an exception to this might be , which shows a large change in he abundance . however , this large reduction of the he abundance found by mcerlean et al .",
    "( @xcite ) as compared to lennon et al .",
    "( @xcite ) is accompanied by a large change in the stellar parameters . even if we attribute the whole change to the effect of microturbulence ( and not to a new analysis with new data and more refined calculations ) we see that is by far the coolest of the stars in tables  [ tab3 ] and [ tab5 ] and thus we expect a larger influence of microturbulence for it .",
    "in addition , we note that mcerlean et al .",
    "( @xcite ) do not exclude a larger he abundance for this star .",
    "we conclude that data in the literature do not lead to the conclusion that the _ he discrepancy _ in o and early b supergiants is completely due to microturbulence , although microturbulence helps to reduce it .    except for the discussed reduction of the he abundance",
    ", we do not see a clear pattern in the parameter changes in tables  [ tab3 ] and [ tab5 ] .",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 can both increase or decrease when microturbulence is introduced , and thus we are tempted to conclude that these changes are still dominated by internal inconsistencies in the analyses that appear when we compare values that can not be distinguished within the adopted uncertainties .    about the problem of the consistency of the fits to lines , we find that the dilution of @xmath2 4471 is only partially solved , even when line  blocking is considered as here .",
    "the fits to the rest of lines do not improve much either in the stars we analyze here .",
    "so the consideration of both microturbulence and line  blocking in the analysis can not completely make an agreement between the results from triplet and singlet lines , though they help to improve it .",
    "we study for the first time the effect of microturbulence in the whole o spectral range , from late to early o types . introducing microturbulence in the solution of the statistical equilibrium and",
    "transfer equations , and then in the formal solution ( i.e. , in the absorption coefficient ) , we conclude that for higher gravities the effect in the lines is negligible .",
    "this together with the low values of microturbulence usually found for high luminosity class stars , lead us to conclude that only o supergiants have sensitivity to microturbulence effects at a given @xmath0 .    in examining the behaviour with microturbulence of the lines we use in our analysis ,",
    "we show that only lines and the core of @xmath2 4686    are sensitive to microturbulence . for lines we show that , as should be expected , there is not a constant pattern for each line , but it depends on the parameters considered , that determine the strength of the line and its degree of saturation .",
    "this invalidates generalizations to the whole o spectral range made upon results obtained just for a certain spectral type .    in order to quantify the sensitivity of stellar parameters to microturbulence we find that changes in the parameters induced by a value of microturbulence of 15 kms@xmath3 are enclosed within the standard error box of our analyses .",
    "we think that the lack of a clear pattern in the changes induced in @xmath0 and @xmath1 is just due to the fact that we are varying the parameters within this error box .",
    "we do however find a systematic change in @xmath4 towards lower he abundances when microturbulence is introduced .",
    "in particular we find that late o supergiants show a decrease of 0.020.04 in @xmath4 ( this last value when including other effects that add to microturbulence ) , which is in agreement with previous results pointing to the inverse relation between the microturbulence assumed and the he abundance obtained ( smith & howarth ) .",
    "early types are less sensitive to microturbulence , and might not show a difference in the derived he abundance .      looking to individual lines",
    "we find that the fits to @xmath2 4471    are improved when considering microturbulence , but not to the extent of completely explaining its dilution . on the other hand",
    "@xmath2@xmath2 4922 , 4387    are sometimes slightly better and sometimes slightly worse fitted , in the last case with model cores a bit too strong or a bit too weak , respectively .",
    "the rest of the lines keep the same quality in the fit .",
    "the _ lines problem _ is therefore only partially solved by simply considering microturbulence , even with line  blocking included in the model profiles .",
    "therefore our conclusion is that microturbulence is affecting the derivation of stellar parameters , but its effect is comparable to the adopted uncertainties .",
    "thus it can reduce moderate he overabundances and solve line fit quality differences , but it can not explain by itself large he overabundances in o stars , and we are forced to conclude that these are due to other effects , whether real or caused by artifacts in our analyses . this last point will probably not find a definitive answer until we are able to derive reliable abundances of c , n and o in the atmospheres of o stars that we can correlate with the he abundances .    we want to thank neil mcerlean and danny lennon for their help , suggestions and many clarifying discussions .",
