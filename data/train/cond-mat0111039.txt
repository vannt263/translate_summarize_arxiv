    "it is well established both theoretically and experimentally that bulk s - wave superconductivity is robust with respect to the addition of non - magnetic impurities ( anderson theorem  @xcite ) . by contrast",
    ", magnetic impurities affect a mechanism of pair - breaking on the system which suppresses and eventually destroys the superconducting phase .",
    "remarkably , in such systems , the quasi - particle energy gap vanishes more rapidly than the order parameter , admitting the existence of a gapless superconducting phase .",
    "the ( mean - field ) theory of the gap suppression was explored in a classic work by abrikosov and gorkov  @xcite . since this pioneering work",
    ", it is now realized that this scheme applies more widely , encompassing general time - reversal ( @xmath0 ) symmetry breaking perturbations ( for a review see , e.g. , refs .",

    ", we will consider the general phenomenology of a disordered superconducting thin film subject to a homogeneous in - plane magnetic field .",
    "generally , a bulk superconductor subject to a weak magnetic field of magnitude @xmath1 enters a meissner phase  @xcite : the field is expelled from the bulk , penetrating only a thin surface layer down to the london penetration depth . in the meissner phase , the quasi - particle properties of the bulk states are not affected by the magnetic field and , thus , are largely insensitive to disorder .",
    "however , if the dimensions of the superconductor are diminished to a scale comparable to the penetration depth , field lines enter the sample and the superconductivity becomes strongly suppressed . here",
    "the quasi - particle properties deviate significantly from those of the unperturbed system : in particular , the system can exhibit a gapless phase . at the level of mean - field ,",
    "the properties of the thin film superconductor mirror those of the magnetic impurity system and are described by the abrikosov - gorkov ( ag ) phenomenology  @xcite . however , beyond the level of mean - field , phase coherence effects due to normal disorder strongly influence the long - range properties of the system . in the following , we will investigate the properties of the gapless phase in the thin film superconducting system focusing on two situations : in the first case , we will consider an arrangement of normal impurities which are drawn at random from a @xmath2-correlated distribution . in the second case",
    ", we will consider the superconducting system subject to a disordered array of columnar defects , i.e.  an impurity potential which does not depend on the coordinate perpendicular to the plane .",
    "the two arrangements are depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig - dc ] .",
    "when applied to a superconductor , a magnetic field has two effects : firstly , it induces a zeeman splitting and , secondly , it couples to the orbital motion of the electrons .",
    "both have the effect of suppressing superconductivity . whereas , in a bulk system , the orbital effect usually dominates , in very thin films the opposite situation arises .",
    "the crossover can be estimated in the following way  @xcite : the critical magnetic field associated with the orbital effect is roughly determined by the condition that the flux threading an area spanned by the coherence length is of the order of one flux quantum , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the coherence length in the dirty system with order parameter @xmath5 and diffusion constant @xmath6 .",
    "now , if the width of the film @xmath7 becomes smaller than the coherence length , @xmath8 , this has to be replaced by the condition @xmath9 , where @xmath10 represents the in - plane field .",

    "@xmath11 is obtained from the condition that the energy splitting between up(@xmath12)- and down(@xmath13)-spins is roughly of the size of the order parameter , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the land @xmath16-factor and @xmath17 the bohr magneton . comparing the two",
    ", one concludes that the orbital effect is dominant in suppressing superconductivity when @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fermi wavelength and @xmath20 the elastic mean free path .    in the following ,",
    "we restrict attention to systems where @xmath21 and the zeeman splitting can be neglected . to be concrete , we will consider a thin film system where the relevant length scales are arranged in the following hierarchy : @xmath22\\ll\\xi .",

    "finally , @xmath25 implies that the subband splitting due to size quantization is small and many subbands are occupied .",
    "thus , from the point of view of the normal electrons , the system is effectively three - dimensional .    before turning to the theoretical analysis ,",
    "let us first briefly summarize the main results of this investigation . at the level of mean - field ,",
    "the superconducting system with an in - plane magnetic field is described by the ag theory  @xcite , independent of the nature of the normal disorder potential ( diffusive or columnar ) .",
    "the parameter governing the suppression of the quasi - particle energy gap is set by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the flux through an area perpendicular to the field spanned by the width of the film @xmath7 and the superconducting coherence length @xmath28 . as found for the magnetic impurity system  @xcite , within the gapped phase , the sharp edge in the quasi - particle density of states ( dos ) predicted by mean - field",
    "is softened by the nucleation of localized tail states which extend into the sub - gap region . in this sense ,",
    "the mean - field gap edge becomes a mobility edge separating a region of bulk ( weakly localized ) quasi - particle states from strongly localized tail states . in the following",
    ", we will demonstrate that these sub - gap states are induced by optimal fluctuations of the random impurity potential and are reflected as inhomogeneous instanton field configurations of the mean - field equations . in the vicinity of the gap edge @xmath29 , the energy scaling of these tails is universal  @xcite , depending only on the distance from @xmath29 , the dimensionless parameter @xmath30 and dimensionality . in @xmath31 ,",

    "@xmath35 is a known dimensionless function of the control parameter @xmath30 .    at the mean - field level",
    ", the choice of disorder does not affect the results qualitatively .",
    "however , within the gapless phase , the low - energy physics depends sensitively on the character of the impurity potential and , in particular , on whether or not it respects inversion symmetry . within the diffusive regime @xmath36 ,",
    "the quasi - particle states exhibit a localized or `` spin - insulator '' phase with a localization length @xmath37 which depends on the fundamental symmetry of the system  @xcite .",
    "however , it is within the _ ergodic _ regime @xmath38 $ ] , where the influence of the inversion symmetry is most clearly exposed . here",
    "the quasi - particle properties become universal , dependent only on the fundamental symmetry class  @xcite .",
    "a complete classification scheme of ten symmetry classes  @xcite , corresponding to the ten large families of symmetric spaces identified by cartan , exists ; four of these symmetry classes are relevant in the context of superconductity  @xcite .",
    "possible symmetries are time - reversal , spin - rotation , particle - hole and chiral symmetry .",
    "now s - wave superconductors possess particle - hole symmetry but , generically , do not exhibit chiral symmetry .",
    "furthermore , they may or may not possess time - reversal and/or spin - rotation symmetry . here ,",
    "as one might expect , one finds that the diffusive film in a magnetic field belongs to ` symmetry class c ' ( according to cartan s notation ) which corresponds to spin - rotation symmetry , but broken time - reversal symmetry . by contrast  despite the presence of the magnetic field ",
    "the film with columnar defects manifests a hidden symmetry placing the superconductor in the higher symmetry class ci which is usually characteristic of systems possessing time - reversal invariance .",
    "the distinct symmetry classes manifest themselves in the energy dependence of the density of states for @xmath39 .",
    "thus , although superficially the suppression of superconductivity does not respond to geometrical symmetries , manifestations of the berry - robnik symmetry effect can be observed in the gapless phase .",
    "the distinct low - energy behavior predicted above is confirmed by numerics .",
    "finally , to complete our discussion , we turn to the consideration of the influence of an in - plane magnetic field on the spectral properties of a normal metal - superconductor ( ns ) bi - layer . here",
    "the interplay of macroscopic quantum coherence phenomena in the superconductor and the mesoscopic metal leads to interesting effects  @xcite .",
    "generally , a superconductor brought into contact with a normal system tends to impact aspects of its superconducting character onto the latter . at the origin of this phenomenon",
    "is the andreev reflection  @xcite of electrons at the interface : an electron with energy smaller than @xmath5 may be retro - reflected off the boundary as a hole , and a cooper pair added to the condensate in the superconductor .",
    "the coherent superposition of the incident electron with the reflected hole leads to a non - vanishing pair amplitude within the normal region .",
    "in particular , the density of states within the normal region may develop a gap  whose size depends on the coupling @xmath40 between the two systems . here",
    "we consider the case of weak coupling , where the induced gap @xmath41 .",
    "a parallel magnetic field counteracts this phenomenon by suppressing the energy gap even within the superconductor .",
    "below , we will show that the field necessary to suppress the induced gap in the normal region is much smaller than the field required to drive the superconductor into the gapless phase .",
    "however , the coupling to the normal region also induces a non - vanishing dos at low energies @xmath42 in the superconductor .",
    "here we consider two different geometries , namely a planar ns bi - layer as well as an ns cylinder with the magnetic field directed along the axis . in the second system",
    "the enclosed flux leads to a periodic modulation of the field effect as first observed in an experiment by little and parks  @xcite . only for small enough cylinders the system reaches the gapless phase in certain ranges of the magnetic field . by further decreasing the radius , superconductivity is completely suppressed around half - integer flux quanta threading the cylinder , as predicted by de gennes  @xcite and very recently verified experimentally by liu _ et al .",

    "the properties of thin disordered ns bi - layers have been studied in a recent work by fominov and feigelman  @xcite . by means of the coupled usadel equations for the hybrid system , they investigated the density of states as well as the parallel and perpendicular critical fields of the bi - layer as a function of the interface transparency .",

    "note that @xmath5 here is the self - consistently determined order parameter .",
    "the presence of the normal layer leads to a renormalization of the order parameter . at weak coupling , however , the proximity induced suppression of the order parameter is small",
    ". therefore , we concentrate on the much more pronounced effect on the quasi - particle dos .    subjecting the action  ( [ gamma3 ] ) to a saddle point analysis , one obtains the following coupled usadel - like equations ,    @xmath210\\eq\\gamma[q_s , q_n],\\nn\\\\ d_s\\tilde\\partial(q_s\\tilde\\partial q_s)-[i\\epsilon\\sph_3\\otimes\\scc_3\\!-\\!\\hat\\delta\\sph_2,q_s]\\eq\\gamma[q_n , q_s].\\nn\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as a simple guiding example , let us first consider the properties of the system in the absence of a magnetic field , where the order parameter can be chosen to be real .",
    "now , in situations where the superconducting terminal is represented by a bulk system , the latter simply acts as a boundary condition for the normal region .",
    "however , in the present case , the single superconducting channel is itself heavily influenced by the contact with the normal region . as a result , fominov and feigelman  @xcite",
    "have shown that a gap develops in the normal region while in the superconductor quasi - particle states at energies down to the size of the proximity effect induced gap are generated .    to see this explicitly ,",

    "[ sub - plan ] , a planar ns bi - layer is investigated .",
    "subsequently , in sec .",
    "[ sub - cylin ] , we study a setup where the bi - layers are wrapped around a cylinder with the magnetic field directed along the cylinder axis .",
    "while in the first case the magnetic field effect is due only to the flux enclosed between the n- and s - layer , here the system as a whole encloses magnetic flux which leads to markedly different behavior .      in the planar geometry , as",
    "before , the appropriate gauge is the london gauge @xmath226 . here",
    "the constant @xmath227 is determined through the condition that the supercurrent through a cross section of the bi - layer vanishes  @xcite : @xmath228 where @xmath229 . to a first approximation , @xmath230 .",
    "thus , no supercurrent flows in the @xmath231 region and , therefore , the supercurrent in the @xmath232 region has to vanish as well , i.e.  @xmath233 which implies @xmath234 .",
    "using the same ansatz as for the field - free case , one obtains @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the distance between the two layers .",
    "as pointed out earlier , being a single - channel system , the superconductor alone does not feel the magnetic field .",
    "again we are interested in the dos at energies well below the gap , @xmath216 . as in the field",
    "free case , an expansion in @xmath237 leads to @xmath238 where @xmath239 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath221 as before .",
    "thus , in the two channel case , the magnetic field leads to a suppression of the proximity effect .",
    "( [ kappa - n ] ) shows that the closing of the induced gap is described by the ag theory , where the relevant parameter is @xmath240 .",
    "therefore , one finds that the characteristic field @xmath241 causing the proximity effect induced gap to vanish is much weaker than the field necessary to drive the superconductor into the gapless phase ( i.e.  taking into account the finite width of the individual layer ! ) .      while in the planar geometry",
    "a non - vanishing supercurrent is forbidden , in the cylindrical geometry a supercurrent can flow around the cylinder : in contrast to the previous case , the system now encloses magnetic flux .    starting with a single superconducting layer , for the cylindrical geometry , the most convenient gauge to choose is the symmetric gauge @xmath242 , where we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath243 . now",
    "the phase degree of freedom has to be taken into account , and a more general ansatz for the matrices @xmath66 solving the saddle point equations is needed : @xmath244 where @xmath245 , and the phase matches the phase of the order parameter , @xmath246 $ ] . substituting this ansatz into the saddle point equation ,",
    "one obtains @xmath247 thus , even in the absence of the ns coupling , the magnetic field affects the properties of the superconductor .",
    "the integer @xmath148 has to be chosen such that it minimizes @xmath248 , and , therefore , by increasing the magnetic field , the parameter governing the gap suppression , @xmath249 varies periodically between @xmath250 and @xmath251 , where @xmath252 is the diameter of the cylinder .",
    "the size of the energy gap is @xmath253 , and the superconductor enters the gapless phase when @xmath254 .",
    "this condition can only be fulfilled if @xmath255 .    as pointed out earlier , the magnetic field not only suppresses the energy gap , but also renormalizes the order parameter @xmath5 .",
    "i.e.  the order parameter in the formulae above has to be determined self - consistently . at @xmath108",
    ", the self - consistency equation can be cast in the form  @xcite @xmath256    thus , the periodic modulation of @xmath30 also leads to a periodic modulation of the order parameter .",
    "similarly , the transition temperature @xmath257 , which obeys  @xcite @xmath258 is a periodic function of the applied field as first observed by little and parks  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in small rings superconductivity is completely suppressed in a certain range of magnetic fields around half - integer flux quanta threading the cylinder  @xcite .",
    "only very recently it has been possible to manufacture small enough cylinders , where this prediction could be verified experimentally  @xcite .",

    "as expected , both vanish around half - integer flux - quanta while they reach their unperturbed maximal values at integer flux quanta .",

    ", the equation for the normal region reads @xmath266 once again , the mean - field equation assumes the form of an ag equation with the parameter @xmath267 . comparing the two values @xmath268 and @xmath269 , we find that @xmath270 , i.e.  the proximity gap is suppressed before the superconductor itself would enter the gapless regime . at the same time",
    "the solution for the superconductor takes the form @xmath271 yielding @xmath272 .",
    "i.e.  the combined influence of the presence of the normal region and the magnetic field leads to an enhanced density of states at low energies in the superconductor .",
    "this concludes our discussion of the mean - field properties of thin disordered ns hybrid systems .",
    "taking into account the influence of fluctuations , it is straightforward to see that the low - energy properties of the quasi - particle states are dictated by the same theory obtained in the previous section . here , we assume the disorder in the n- and s - channel to be uncorrelated which violates @xmath181-invariance .",
    "thus , the gapless hybrid system is described by symmetry class c.",
    "to conclude , we have cast the properties of a disordered thin superconducting film subject to a parallel magnetic field in the framework of a statistical field theory . in the mean - field approximation , known results from the ag theory  @xcite are recovered .",
    "the same phenomenology applies to diffusive films as well as films with columnar defects . in the diffusive case",
    ", we have shown that  within the gapped phase  taking into account inhomogeneous instanton solutions of the saddle point equation , the hard gap is destroyed . by analogy with the magnetic impurity problem  @xcite ,",
    "exponentially small tails within the gap region appear .",
    "the same is to be expected for the columnar defects .",
    "( for @xmath273 the coupling between the different subbands complicates the analysis .",
    "however , the general behavior should not be affected qualitatively . )    within the gapless phase , the berry - robnik symmetry phenomenon leads to different low - energy properties .",
    "as confirmed by numerics , for the diffusive film , the dos vanishes quadratically for @xmath39 ( class c ) as one might expect for superconducting systems where @xmath0-invariance is lifted .",
    "however , in the presence of only columnar defects , the dos at small energies is linear in @xmath101 ( class ci ) , a behavior characteristic of systems which possess time - reversal invariance .",
    "although the @xmath181-symmetry can not prevent the gradual destruction of superconductivity by the magnetic field , some compensation for the @xmath0-breaking is still effective .    in ns bi - layers",
    ", we have shown that the coupling between the two systems leads to ( i ) an energy gap @xmath274 in the dos of the normal layer , and ( ii ) a finite density of states in the superconductor at energies @xmath42 . in this geometry",
    ", a parallel magnetic field suppresses the induced proximity gap @xmath274 .",
    "the characteristic field @xmath275 determining the occurrence of the gapless phase is greatly reduced as compared to the field @xmath276 that drives the superconductor into the gapless phase , being roughly @xmath277 . in a cylindrical geometry , the energy gap shows a periodic modulation with the magnetic field reminiscent of the little - parks effect : if the cylinder encloses multiples of the flux quantum @xmath278 , this can be compensated by the phase of the order parameter .",
    "thus , the variation of the energy gap is determined by the effective field @xmath279 .",
    "the gapless phase can only be reached in sufficiently small systems , where the diameter of the cylinder fulfills the relation @xmath255 .",
