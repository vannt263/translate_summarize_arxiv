    "<S> we use the program minuit  @xcite to minimize ( [ eq : likelihood ] ) . note that with the procedure outlined above </S>",
    "<S> , we only account for statistical uncertainties in the event rate ; a more detailed analysis incorporating systematic uncertainties goes well beyond the present scope .    </S>",
    "<S> we first attempt to fit the generated recoil spectrum with a single dm particle . </S>",
    "<S> the dm mass and spin independent dm - nucleon cross section are used as the fitting parameters . using the procedure described above </S>",
    "<S> , one obtains the dotted ( blue ) histogram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ four ] . as can already be seen by eye , </S>",
    "<S> the one - component fit is poor . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , from the goodness - of - fit test the single - dm hypothesis is rejected with confidence well above  99% .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to a two - component dm model . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the recoil spectrum depends on the dm masses @xmath233 , cross sections , @xmath234 , and local densities @xmath157 , with @xmath235 and subject to the constraint @xmath236 . thus , there are in principle five parameters to be inferred from the data of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ four ] . </S>",
    "<S> there exist , however , degeneracies between different parameters in the two - component spectrum so that only certain combinations are accessible . to understand this it is helpful to examine the parametric dependence of the recoil spectrum  ( [ diffrate ] ) on @xmath233 , @xmath157 , and @xmath234 . using  ( [ sign ] ) , and in the limit of @xmath237 and @xmath238 one finds @xmath239 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath240 is the dm velocity dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> observe that 1 ) only the product @xmath241 enters in @xmath242 and 2 ) the exponential shape of the spectrum becomes independent of the dm mass for @xmath243 . from the first observation it is clear that one can not independently determine both @xmath157 and @xmath234 , but only the product . </S>",
    "<S> the second observation suggests that a second degeneracy between @xmath241 and @xmath233 develops once @xmath244 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , further assumptions about the model parameters are required if one desires to break these degeneracies . fixing , for example , mass and density of the heavier dm to its input values , </S>",
    "<S> one then easily recovers recovers all remaining model parameters within a `` @xmath245''-range or better . </S>",
    "<S> the result of this fit is shown by the solid ( black ) histogram in fig .  [ four ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that the successful determination of the parameters of the lighter state required that at least two bins were populated . </S>",
    "<S> if one tried to fit the light dm particle to a single bin , many combinations @xmath246 would reproduce the signal thus leading to a high degree of degeneracy in @xmath247 and @xmath248 . in this regard , </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that  complementary to liquid noble gas experiments  potential future ton - scale cryogenic detectors such as supercdms  @xcite or eureca  @xcite may be very powerful in disentangling the parameters of a multi - component dm scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the reason lies in a much better energy resolution . </S>",
    "<S> for example , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite estimates for a ton - scale ge detector @xmath249 ( @xmath250 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this will allow one to obtain a more detailed picture on the spectral shape of the signal . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a different target mass with respect to xe may prove most valuable when attempting to draw differential conclusions by combining results from both detector designs .    [ [ discussion . ] ] * discussion . * + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this paper we have investigated the simplest model in which dm is stabilized by a non - abelian discrete symmetry . the model is based on the symmetry group @xmath1 , which is the smallest non - abelian finite group . </S>",
    "<S> the non - abelian nature of this theory manifests itself in the matter content and interactions of the dark sector , which leads to multi - component dm and a novel early universe cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> robust constraints from direct detection experiments exist for the lightest dm species , and the two - component nature of dm can potentially be tested at future ton - scale experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> while we have focused on the phenomenology relevant for direct detection experiments , the @xmath1 model also has implications for high energy colliders and indirect detection probes . at colliders , the most important consequence of the @xmath1 model , like other models in which dm couples to the sm through the higgs portal , is to cause the higgs boson to decay invisibly if kinematically allowed . </S>",
    "<S> an invisibly decaying higgs boson can be discovered using the vector boson fusion and @xmath251 production channels at the lhc ( @xmath252 tev ) with 30 fb@xmath253 of data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another generic dm collider probe is a monojet produced in association with pairs of dark matter particles  @xcite . in scalar singlet dm models , this occurs via gluon fusion accompanied by emission of a jet . </S>",
    "<S> while the tevatron is not sensitive to the monojet signature in this class of dm models , the lhc could potentially probe regions with large higgs portal couplings @xmath254  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that a more complete study of the monojet signature in higgs portal dm models going beyond the effective field theory approach is warranted given that a relatively light higgs and a top quark loop enter into the amplitude .    </S>",
    "<S> a potential indirect probe of the @xmath1 model is to observe gamma rays from annihilating @xmath28 or @xmath29 particles . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , fermi - lat data on the isotropic gamma - ray diffuse emission  @xcite , depending on various astrophysical assumptions , can constrain low mass @xmath255 gev dm particles annihilating through the higgs portal  @xcite . for such constraints to be relevant </S>",
    "<S> , the lightest component should carry most of the cosmic dm abundance , since the gamma - ray flux scales as the square of the dm density . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , light dm particles with very large higgs portal couplings will be depleted efficiently and therefore not subject to such constraints . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is to observe monochromatic gamma - ray lines via @xmath256 . </S>",
    "<S> this has been studied in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and fermi - lat data allows one to probe the model deep within the resonance region @xmath257 .    </S>",
    "<S> there are many directions for future investigations with dm and non - abelian discrete symmetries . within the minimal @xmath1 model </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to consider the case in which @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) condense , leading to the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath1 symmetry to the @xmath34 ( @xmath2 ) subgroup . </S>",
    "<S> this will still lead to a viable model of dm and likely will have distinct signatures compared to the unbroken @xmath1 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> it would also be interesting to explore larger non - abelian finite groups , and ultimately non - abelian discrete gauge symmetries as the origin of dm stability . finally , given that non - abelian discrete symmetries may underlie the patterns observed in the quark and lepton masses and mixings , it is interesting to speculate that dm stability may intimately be connected to flavor symmetries .    </S>",
    "<S> stability on cosmological time scales constitutes one of the few and robust guiding principles in formulation of a theory of dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> alternatives to the canonical @xmath2 parity symmetry may lead to new phenomena associated with dark matter , as has been clearly demonstrated by our study of the minimal model of @xmath1 dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that new data from a variety of experimental and observational fronts will soon bring us closer in unraveling the particle nature of dark matter and the symmetry which protects its lifetime .      </S>",
