    ": there may be many closed extensions between two extremal extensions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these extensions can be parametrized by closed subspaces @xmath11 of the quotient @xmath12 ( @xmath13 denotes the domain of the operator ) .",
    "it is natural to ask for a characterization of @xmath12 for special `` singular '' manifolds as well as for the fredholm property and explicit index formulas of the assigned closed extensions @xmath14 of a given operator @xmath15 .",
    "the complete answers to these and related questions for the gau - bonnet operator , the signature operator and the spin  dirac operator ( which we refer to as the `` geometric operators '' ) on manifolds with cone like singularities are given in the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider manifolds with _ metric horns _ in the restricted sense of @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath16 with warped product metric @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 . on these manifolds",
    "all the geometric operators have a common normal form on @xmath10 @xmath20 this will be discussed in detail in section 2 .",
    "section 3 investigates the nature of @xmath12 and the fredholm property . in section 4",
    "we elaborate on the index problem .",
    "the key tool is a homotopy transforming the operator of interest into a so called regular singular operator .",
    "regular singular operators turn up in the conic situation , for which index formulas exist ( cf . the papers mentioned above ) . with the help of a result in @xcite",
    "we will show that the index remains constant during the homotopy . by this procedure",
    "we bypass the need of an explicit functional calculus on metric horns , which seems to be very difficult and not yet developed to the knowledge of the authors .",
    "( cf . also the remark in @xcite : _ `` at the level of an explicit functional calculus the more difficult case of metric horns must be distinguished from the special case of metric cones ... '' _ ) the last two sections are devoted to the geometric operators as concrete examples .",
    "we point out as a remarkable fact that the situation of metric horns turns out to be much simpler than the case of metric cones .",
    "for example , by looking at the space @xmath12 describing the variety of closed extensions , we prove the following characterizations for the geometric operators on manifolds @xmath6 with metric horns:@xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 denotes the spin  dirac operator on the base manifold @xmath9 of the horns .",
    "let us emphasize , that the nature of @xmath12 depends only on the topology of @xmath9 for the first two operators .",
    "it is an interesting question , whether there exists a canonical 1:1 correspondence between ideal boundary conditions and closed extensions of the gau - bonnet operator in this particular situation ( cf .",
    "* theorem 3.8 a ) ) .    for the spin ",
    "dirac operator @xmath25 is not a topological invariant ( cf .",
    "however , we have at least independence of @xmath26 under conformal changes of the metric on @xmath9 for this operator .",
    "this yields a remarkable contrast to the cone like case , where always small eigenvalues ( in the interval @xmath27 ) are involved .",
    "they are obviously not stable under even such an easy deformation as multiplying the metric of @xmath9 by a constant factor .",
    "in section 5 we derive an index formula for the spin ",
    "dirac operator : @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the index formula for the gau - bonnet operator on manifolds with horns developed in section 6 becomes simply @xmath30    we emphasize that this formula is not based on our analysis but is derived by reinterpretation of results of j. cheeger .",
    "in contrast to the cone like case there occurs no additional spectral data of @xmath9 and we conclude in particular @xmath31 .    at this point",
    "we would like to make some historical remarks : a detailed analytic study ( hodge theory , functional calculus , index formulas , ... ) of inductively defined singular spaces based on manifolds with metric cones was first carried out by j. cheeger in the papers @xcite . in the same spirit",
    "@xcite considered the spin  dirac operator , stressing the importance of small eigenvalues of the operator on the base manifold of the cones .",
    "the paper @xcite derived an index formula for differential operators with a special normal form .",
    "the framework of @xcite covers the geometric operators on manifolds with asymptotic conic singularities and motivated the present paper to a great extend . in the meantime",
    "the regular singular case was generalized in @xcite and @xcite and became applicable to singular algebraic curves ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and to manifolds with finitely many ends and some further geometric conditions .",
    "another generalization of the regular singular case to operators of fuchsian type is part of @xcite .",

    "according to section 3 , the closed extensions of the gau - bonnet and the signature operator on manifolds with metric horns are characterized by subspaces of @xmath61 .",
