    "atomic stabilization means that the ionization rate of an atom decreases with increasing intensity of intense , high - frequency laser field , which is one of the most interesting nonperturbative phenomena observed in laser - atom interaction and attracts much attention recently .",
    "this effect has been predicted by both quantum theories @xmath0 $ ] and classical theories @xmath1 $ ] , and has recently been verified experimentally@xmath2 $ ] . in particular , sundaram and jensen",
    "[ 5 ] connect successively this exciting phenomenon with the chaotic dynamics .",
    "more recently , by numerically solving time - dependent schrodinger equation for one - dimensional model , some researchers have investigated the phase - space dynamics of intense - field stabilization and found the existence of a striking structure - fringe structure @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "these findings enrich greatly the discussions on atomic stabilization and helpful to better understand the stabilization mechanism . however , the dynamical mechanism of the fringe structure is far from fully understood .    in this paper , using the approximate analytic expression of the evolution operator of the atom - laser system , we shall demonstrate the fringe structure from classical distribution and quantal wigner distribution .",
    "furthermore , in light of nonlinear dynamics we shall discuss the dynamical mechanism underlying this striking structure .",
    "as we shall see later that , the fringe structure associates closely with the ionization process in the regime of stabilization .    the one - dimensional model is widely used in studying the atom stabilization phenomenon @xmath4 $ ] in the strong - field laser - atom physics , its hamiltonian is @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the strength and frequency of the oscillating electric field , respectively . in all calculations of this paper , the atomic units ( @xmath7 )",
    "is adopted for simplicity .",
    "usually , the stabilization phenomenon is discussed in the kramers - henneberger ( kh ) frame , i.e. the laser - atom interaction is viewed from the stand point of a free classical electron oscillating in a lasert field . by this way , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the amplitude of an electron s quiver motion .",
    "notice that the wave function in the kh frame is related to that in the length gauge by an unitary transformation .",
    "this is a periodically driven system . with the help of a time - order exponential ,",
    "the formal evolution operator at @xmath10 can be written as , @xmath11 \\,\\,\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the time order operator .",
    "the time evolution operator referring to one period @xmath13 is the so - called floquet operator @xmath14 if the frequency of the laser field is assumed to be asymptotically high , we can discard all but the the time average of the kh potential , namely , @xmath15 then the hamiltonian becomes time independent and takes the form of @xmath16 the eigenstates of this system is called kh states .",
    "so one is led to the prediction that all kh states will be stable .",
    "however , in practical case of finite field frequency rather than an asymptotically high frequency , sundaram and jensen pointed out that the high order fourier terms are also important and can not be neglected for simplicity . with the assumption that every coefficients of the fourier expansion of @xmath17 are equally important",
    ", the potential can be described by a periodic train of delta kicks as follows , @xmath18 in @xmath19 $ ] the validity of the above assumption has been tested for a wide range of parameters .",
    "it is found that in the regime of atomic stabilization the approximation can provide a good qualitative description .",
    "provided that the zero of time is chosen halfway between two consecutive kicks , in terms of ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) , the floquet operator is @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the half - periodic time evolution of a free electron , and @xmath22 represents an impulse on momentum .",
    "the above evolution operator describes the interaction between field and atoms .",
    "it is easy to show that the above operator is time - reversal invariant .",
    "the classical version of the above quantum floquet operator ( eq.8 ) takes form , @xmath23 where @xmath24 , propagates the trajectory for a half - period ahead along the constant momentum ; @xmath25 , describes an impulse on the electron .",
    "obviously , @xmath26 is area - preserving in phase plane .    by iterating @xmath26 for a variety of initial conditions and plotting the trajectories in the phase plane @xmath27",
    ", we can construct a poincare surface of section which provides an overview of the classical dynamics .",
    "the phase plots of @xmath26 demonstrate many different structures for different parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 . a detailed analysis show that",
    ", for the case of stabilization the phase structures can be classified into three main cases as we show in figs .",
    "1,2 and 3 .",
    "case one , as shown in fig.1 , the @xmath30 is the unique 1-periodic elliptic fixed point . outside the regular island around @xmath31 ,",
    "the phase plane is filled with chaotic trajectories . in case two ( fig.2 ) , with changing the parameters , this elliptic point @xmath31 undergoes a pitch bifurcation to an unstable hyperbolic fixed point and gives birth to a pair of 1-periodic elliptic fixed points ( @xmath32 ) locate at @xmath33 approximately .",
    "outside these two regular islands the phase plane is full of stochastic orbits .",
    "case three ( fig.3 ) , the @xmath34 and @xmath35 becomes unstable , and the phase plane is mainly filled by chaotic trajectories and very small fraction of regular islands . in term of classical description of ionization ,",
    "the electrons initiated in the islands will never be ionized .",
    "the regular islands around high - periodic fixed points are too small compared with that of 1-periodic fixed points and contribute little to the confinement of the electrons .",
    "therefore , the above analyses provide three typical parameters @xmath36 which are used in following discussions on ionization suppression .",
    "in addition to those fixed points , kam tori and cantori , another striking structures commonly existing in fig.1,2 and 3 are the fringe pattern in the lower and upper momentum plane .",
    "this is so called fringe structure , first observed in classical simulations of atomic behavior in the stabilization regime by grobe and law @xmath37 $ ] , and recently confirmed by watson et al in their quantum wigner functions of quantum description @xmath3 $ ] .    in view of nonlinear dynamics , the unstable manifold of a steady state is a set of points @xmath38 such that the orbit going backward in time starting from @xmath38 approaches this steady state .",
    "the stable manifold can be similarly defined for the forward orbit .",
    "a stable manifold can not intersect other stable manifolds , and neither do the unstable manifolds .",
    "however , as chaos occur , stable and unstable manifolds can intersect with each other .",
    "these invariant manifolds characterize the dynamical properties of the whole system @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "therefore , we conjecture that these fringe structures are relics of the unstable invariant manifolds .",
    "to identify it , we employ a numerical algorithm ( see e.g. @xmath40 $ ] ) to simulate those unstable manifolds for a rather long time . the results are plotted in the same figure so as to be compared with the fringe structures .",
    "the correspondence between the fringe structures and unstable manifolds is obvious .    in case three ,",
    "the invariant manifolds are obtained according to the 1-periodic hyperbolic point ( 0,0 ) .",
    "however , in case one and case two , things are much more complicated . through careful investigations ,",
    "we find that , in case one , unstable manifolds of 4-periodic saddles @xmath41 surrounding the stable island associated with the 1-periodic orbit organize the fringe structure ; in case two , the unstable manifolds of period-6 hyperbolic points @xmath42 around the fixed point ( 0,0 ) construct the fringe pattern . because of the symmetry of the map m , the stable manifolds and unstable manifolds are symmetric about x axis .",
    "this fact means that the stable and unstable manifolds intersect with each other for infinite times and form a hyperbolic invariant set .",
    "therefore , in the regime of stabilization the classical ionization process is characterized by chaos .    to deeply understand the phase dynamics of ionizaton process in the classical description , we trace 10000 trajectories which initiate on a piece - line of the phase plane described by @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the phase plane representation of the time - evolution of this piece - line is shown in figure 4 .",
    "it is clear that , a classical particle is attracted by the unstable manifolds and comes close to them along the stable manifolds , meanwhile it moves in the unstable direction determined by the unstable manifolds .",
    "therefore , the whole piece - line is folded and stretched along the unstable manifolds and demonstrates a complex geometric configuration .",
    "thus , a particle has more probability to stay near the unstable manifolds , this is the reason for the existence of fringes and those gaps between them .    from the above analyses , we conclude that",
    ", unstable manifolds play an important role in ionization process and is the dynamical source of the striking fringe structure in the classical phase plane .",
    "a stable state commonly refers to a quantal state of atom irradiated by laser with long lifetime . as the stabilization phenomenon is first discovered in the case of asymptotically high - frequency field , the eigenstates of the time - average hamiltonian ( kh states ) are assumed to be stable states .",
    "however , in order to expect such phenomenon to persist in the face of various experimental realities and can be realistically pursued in the laboratory , the field frequency @xmath45 should be a concrete and finite rather than asymptotically high . in this case , as was pointed out by sundaram and jensen , the high - order fourier coefficients of the expansion of time - dependence halmiltonian is also important .",
    "therefore , the quasienergy eigenstates of the time evolution operator @xmath46 will act as the candidates of the stable states which result in the ionization suppression .",
    "the floquet operator is unitary and satisfies following eigenvalue equation , @xmath47 where the eigenphase @xmath48 is real , @xmath49 is the quasienergy ( qe ) .",
    "the quasienergy wave function @xmath50 describes qe state .",
    "these qe states are obtained by diagonalizing @xmath46 with a large basis of plane waves , @xmath51 .    for the operator",
    "@xmath46 is time - reversal invariant , let the time - reversal operator act on the both sides of eigenvalues equation ( 12 ) , we find that @xmath52 and @xmath53 are both eigenfunctions with the same quasienergy . in general , the bounded states are not degenerate for one - dimensional quantal system .",
    "it is evident that potential @xmath54 is symmetric about zero point .",
    "therefore we conclude that the bound qe states can be described by real functions and parity is a good quantum number .    in following section",
    ", we shall take the second case , where the parameters are @xmath55 , as an example for our discussion .",
    "we calculate the lowest two eigenfunctions and find that the ground state ( qe0 ) possesses even parity and mainly concentrats in the zero point ; the 1-excited state ( qe1 ) with odd parity demonstrates dichotomous collection at @xmath56 .",
    "we use the wave packet propagation method to calculate the evolution of the bound qe states . in this approach ,",
    "an initial wave packet is propagated by the fourier spectral method , which is directly applicable to the free propagation step of the floquet operator , with the impulse delivered once every period .",
    "the free time propagation step is divided into many small intervals to reduce the error , introduced by boundary conditions .",
    "this kinetic propagation is carried out in the momentum space , since time evolution reduces to simple multiplication in that space .",
    "the impulsive step is performed in coordinated space for a similar reason .",
    "a fast fourier transform ( fft ) routine is used to transform the wave function between these two spaces . since the ionization occurs in our problem , an absorptive filter in the asymptotic region ( @xmath57 ) is used to avoid the unphysical reflection of the wave packet from the grid boundary once it is on its way out .",
    "the filter takes the form @xmath58 $ ] @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a large distance and @xmath61 is the width of the filter , the wave function is multiplied by the filter function after each time step .",
    "the time evolution of ground and 1-excited qe states for the case two are plotted in figure 5 , they show a good straight line which indicates an exponential decay @xmath62 . the ionization rate @xmath63 of the corresponding qe states is well defined and relates to the extent of the stability of the qe states .    to study the phase - space evolution of a wave packet , we use the wigner function which is defined by @xmath64 for a given wave function @xmath65 .",
    "this wigner function is formally analog to the classical probability density on phase space , and reduces to it in the limit @xmath66 .    in the exponential decay regime",
    "the wigner function is time invariant except for a decay factor .",
    "therefore , we plot the full wigner function(a ) and its contour plot ( b ) after 20 cycles of evolution in figs.6,7 .",
    "the most striking feature of this plot is the fringe structure observed in the upper and lower region of the figures .",
    "we also use the term fringe to describe the striking structure observed in the wigner functions following watson et al @xmath67 $ ] .    as to the evolution of the ground qe state",
    ", the corresponding wigner distribution contains a strong positive peak at original point and many weak positive peaks .",
    "the strong positive peak at original point results from the even character of the wave function .",
    "those weak peaks resulting in the fringe structures relates closely with the ionization process . in the case of 1-excited qe state",
    "the strong peak at origin is negative because of the odd parity of the wave function . in our time - reversal",
    "invariant model , parity is a good quantum number , therefore the wigner distributions are symmetric about the original point .",
    "this symmetry can be observed clearly in figs.6,7 .",
    "when we compare the quantum phase space with the classical unstable manifolds , surprisely we find that the fringe structure in classical phase space also shows up .",
    "the fringe structure in both quantum and classical phase space has the same symmetry , and locates at the same regions .",
    "since the size of the fringe structures in fig.6 and 7 is much larger than , the quantum uncertainty , namely , the planck constant @xmath68 , this structure is physically significant .",
    "so , we believe that it is quantum signature of the classical unstable manifolds .    as a further test , we also calculate the wigner function of the lowest two kh states and show them in figures 8,9 .",
    "since the wave functions are real and has finite parity , they have the reflection symmetry about q axis and p axis .",
    "wigner distributions of the ground and 1-excited states contain strong positive peak and strong negative peak at original point , respectively .",
    "this character is the same as that discussed above .",
    "however , for these bound kh states , no fringe structure is observed .",
    "this also implies that the fringe structure associates closely with the ionization process .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the phase - space dynamics of atomic stabilization in the frame of a time - reversal invariant model , both classically and quantum mechanically .",
    "our results show that 1 ) the dynamical mechanism of the fringe structure in the classical phase space is the unstable manifolds . in this situation",
    "the ionization process is characterized by chaos .",
    "2 ) the fringe structure observed in the quantum wigner distribution is the quantal signature of the classical unstable manifolds .",
    "3 ) the fringe structure has geometric symmetry about the original point , and associates closely with the ionization process in the regime of stabilization .",
    "our results show a strong connection between the unstable manifolds and the ionization process qualitatively , however , it is still an open question that how the ionization rate is related to the fractal structure of the unstable manifolds , quantatitively .",
    "the study along this direction is undergoing .",
