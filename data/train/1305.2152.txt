    "[ ff_pairing]c . since these pairs from different bands have opposite momenta , the amplitude of the resulted order parameter has spatial oscillation structure .",
    "in contrast with traditional lo phases , the imbalance ( that is , @xmath122 ) of the numbers of pairings with opposite momenta leads to the absence of nodes , giving the generalized lo phase . it can be seen that the pairing mechanism is very different from the case without so coupling , where pairing happens at different bands . in this case , if there is a non - zero momentum pairing , there is always another pairing with the opposite momentum to lower the energy  @xcite . the consequence is the absence of the ff phase and the presence of the lo phase with nodes .",
    "in experiments , the rashba so coupling and an in - plane zeeman field in a square lattice can be realized using six lasers that couple two different hyperfine ground states of atoms @xcite .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the superfluid phase , only a weak optical lattice is needed . for a typical set of parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath123 @xcite , the resulting paring order @xmath124 , which could be further enhanced by increasing the interaction through a feshbach resonance .",
    "the critical zeeman field is generally at the order of 0.5 khz .",
    "these parameters show that the fflo phases should be observable with reasonably low temperature and realistic experimental setup . in experiments",
    ", the magnetization and the pairing order strength can be observed in the standard spin - resolved time of flight image . while the finite center - of - mass momentum of the cooper pairs may be observed using noise - correlation method or momentum - resolved radio - frequency spectroscopy  @xcite . in previous spin - imbalanced fermi gases , the observation of the coexistence of superfluid and magnetism",

    "however , it is no longer true in our case because a bcs phase also has finite magnetization . in order to observe the fflo phase",
    ", one should detect the pairing momentum or the magnetization oscillation in the lo phase directly .",
