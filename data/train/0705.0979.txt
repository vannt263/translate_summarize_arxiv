    "precision measurements of distant type ia supernovae have been an essential ingredient in building the present standard model of cosmology in which the energy density of the universe is dominated by dark energy @xcite .",
    "the main interest so far has been in supernovae in the redshift range 0.5 - 1.5 @xcite , which corresponds to the transition region between matter and dark energy domination .    however , there is a rapidly increasing interest in supernovae at much lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "the low redshift supernovae provide an anchor for the hubble diagram which is important for the determination of dark energy parameters . since they are much brighter they are also useful as a laboratory for calibrating the relation between the supernova light curve shape and its inherent brightness .",
    "a potentially even more interesting feature of low redshift supernovae is that the velocity field associated with the large scale structure of the universe is imprinted on the apparent magnitudes and redshifts of the supernovae .",
    "if this is not corrected for it will lead to relatively large and correlated errors in the measured luminosity distance of low redshift supernovae , a potentially serious source of error for future dark energy surveys @xcite .",
    "however , the velocity field can also be used to probe the local large scale structure of the universe .    with the current fairly small datasets at low redshift only the local dipole @xcite and quadrupole @xcite terms in the velocity field",
    "have been measured ( see also @xcite ) , and agree with other types of flow measurements .",
    "these preliminary studies , however , clearly demonstrate the potential of using type ia supernovae for this purpose .",
    "the very small intrinsic scatter in luminosity means that the local velocity field can be measured as precisely with @xmath2100 supernovae as with an order of magnitude more galaxies used as standard candles .    in the present work we will ,",
    "for the first time , study how future type ia supernova measurements can be used for detailed studies of the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "it turns out that the large scale velocity power spectrum can be measured quite precisely using around @xmath3 supernovae , a number which will be observed with surveys such as the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) @xcite .    in order to investigate the potential of such future measurements we use detailed mock supernova catalogues produced from high resolution n - body simulations .",
    "we find that the survey strategy for measuring the supernovae is very important and investigate this phenomenon in detail .",
    "our most important finding is that future supernova surveys can be used to probe cosmological parameters such as @xmath1 , the amplitude of fluctuations on small scales , at a precision which is competitive with other future cosmological probes .    in section 2",
    "we present the assumed supernova rates and discuss upcoming surveys in this context .",
    "section 3 provides a review of the velocity power spectrum , as well as a simple method for analytically calculating the angular velocity power spectrum as a function of redshift .",
    "details of the simulations and the power spectrum extraction are provided in section 4 .",
    "the extraction of cosmological parameters from our simulated data sets is discussed in section 5 , and finally section 6 contains our conclusions .",
    "the local type ia supernova rate is roughly @xcite @xmath4 and while there is considerable uncertainty about the exact rate ( see e.g.  @xcite for a 3 times higher rate deduced using snfactory data ) , we will adopt the above rate .",
    "if the actual rate is lower ( higher ) then simply a longer ( shorter ) survey time would be needed to reach the same number of measured supernovae .    out to a redshift of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 the total number of supernovae per time is then @xmath7 to probe the velocity structure on different length scales , we will analyse the supernovae in redshift bins .",
    "we compare with theory by calculating the angular power spectrum , @xmath8 , in each redshift bin .    as will be seen below , using upcoming surveys and collecting data in a three - year period , taking a conservative approach ,",
    "the maximum multipole which can be probed at @xmath9 is @xmath10 .",
    "however , the number of supernovae in a bin increases cubically , while the error on individual supernovae @xmath11 increases linearly with distance .",
    "the overall error goes like @xmath12 or @xmath13 , and therefore the precision , that the radial velocity of a given _ angular _ scale can be measured by , increases with distance .",
    "we also note that exactly because the effective error scales like @xmath14 , an improved understanding of the light curve  absolute magnitude relation , and environmental effects , such as dust extinction could dramatically decrease the error on the angular power spectrum , compared to what is forecasted in this paper .",
    "such a decrease is not unreasonable to expect , given the much larger and more homogeneous sample of low redshift type ia supernovae that will be available in the near future .",
    "several upcoming surveys will map large portions of the sky at regular intervals to look for either transient sources or hitherto undiscovered solar system objects . in the near future",
    "there will be projects such as pan - starrs @xcite and skymapper @xcite , and in about 2013 the lsst project @xcite will start .    the scan strategy of these surveys is not necessarily optimised to search for nearby supernovae , while all of them have dedicated programs for intermediate or high redshift supernovae . despite this , with the lsst",
    "a very large fraction of all type ia supernovae out to redshifts of order 0.2 will be detected and their light curves measured in detail .",
    "however , since none of these experiments will perform follow - up spectroscopy of the host galaxy , this task will have to be undertaken using other telescopes .",
    "fortunately the host galaxies will usually be sufficiently bright for spectroscopy even with modest sized telescopes , and the task is therefore not unmanageable .",
    "we note that a sufficiently accurate spectrum can be obtained in roughly 20 minutes using a 1 m class telescope , and a redshift of @xmath15 . ] and thousands of redshifts per year can therefore be measured relatively easily using just a few such telescopes .",
    "we also note that the important part of the spectroscopy is to determine the redshift of the host galaxy , not the supernova , and that the spectroscopic observations can therefore in principle be done long after the supernova event itself .",
    "of course this is true only if the supernova can be determined to be a type ia from the light curve measurements alone with very close to 100% efficiency . with",
    "a precise light curve for a supernova in 6 filters sampled every fourth night in a rolling search , it should be possible to reliably detect if it is a type ia supernova using only photometry @xcite , and determine the luminosity distance very precisely .",
    "in the following we will assume full sky coverage and use numbers corresponding to the total number of supernovae occurring in three years ( assuming the rate given in eq .  [ eq : rate ] ) .",
    "if the number of supernovae is lower the numbers can easily be scaled to a longer observation period .",
    "full sky coverage is not essential as long as it is significantly larger than 0.5 , and the unobserved area is distributed in at most a few large patches , as is also true for cmb observations .",
    "in order to make the analysis of large scale velocity flows simpler we will work with the angular velocity power spectrum . this in turn also makes the extraction of cosmological parameters from the synthetic data easier .",
    "following @xcite the angular velocity power spectrum can be simply related to the matter power spectrum in the linear limit .",
    "the continuity equation of mass relate the velocity and density : @xmath16 .",
    "fourier transforming it , we get @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fourier transform of the density contrast , and @xmath19 is the velocity growth factor @xcite .",
    "the peculiar velocities are measured as averaged quantities over a certain scale .",
    "for example the peculiar velocity derived from observing a supernova , and the host galaxy redshift , is the smoothed velocity on the scale of the host galaxy .",
    "likewise , in a n - body simulation the velocity field is measured using a smoothing kernel .",
    "therefore the power spectrum , be it synthetic or observed , is smoothed by a window function , and related to the matter power spectrum as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fourier transform of the window function .",
    "what we are measuring is the angular power spectrum of the radial peculiar velocities on a shell .",
    "it can be related to the 3d velocity power spectrum as @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 @xmath24 is the spherical bessel function , and @xmath25 is the comoving distance to the shell .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows the analytic angular power spectra at different distances compared to the power spectra obtained by directly finding the radial velocity field averaged over different observers in a large scale n - body simulation .",
    "there is an excellent agreement between the synthetic spectra and the model for small @xmath26 , while at large @xmath26 the discrepancy is due to the assumption of a linear power spectrum , and no shell crossing in fourier space .    to be consistent with the n - body simulation the radial velocity field in the simulation",
    "is determined by smoothing the radial velocities of the particles with the same adaptive smoothing kernel of monaghan and lattanzio @xcite with 33 neighbours that is used in the simulation .",
    "the form of the window function for this smoothing kernel is not a priori clear , since the kernel size is adaptive and varies with density .",
    "therefore one can not just fourier transform the kernel with a fixed @xmath27 .",
    "nonetheless we have found empirically that @xmath28 is an excellent approximation . here @xmath29 is the box size , @xmath30 the number of particles in the simulation , and @xmath31 the number of neighbour particles used in the smoothing process .    the analytic matter power spectrum @xmath32 is a standard linear matter power spectrum with",
    "@xmath33 computed using camb @xcite .      from eq .",
    "[ eq : clv ] we see that the velocity angular power spectrum is related to the matter power spectrum through a convolution . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : clv ] ) and ( [ eq : bl ] ) we can write the angular power spectrum as @xmath34 with @xmath35    following the approach of @xcite , the two @xmath36-dependent terms in the convolution can be significantly simplified in the limit @xmath37 , where the integral is bound from below .",
    "the bessel function is rapidly oscillating , but the envelope has a simple analytic form @xmath38 where @xmath39^{1/2l } l / x\\simeq \\frac{2}{\\rme } ( 1 - \\frac{\\ln 2}{2 l } ) l / x$ ] . collecting terms",
    "we find simply @xmath40\\ ] ] a comparison between the exact formula eq .",
    "[ eq : clv ] ( the dashed line ) and the approximation eq .",
    "[ eq : clvsimple ] ( the dot - dashed line ) is shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] , and very good agreement is found .",
    "the bessel function acts like a triangular filter , such that power at a given @xmath26 only is dependent on scales smaller than @xmath41 , and the slow decline of @xmath42 for @xmath43 washes out any sharp features and breaks in @xmath44 @xcite .    in order to get a simple analytic understanding of the behaviour of @xmath8 we use a crude approximation for @xmath32 , @xmath45 where @xmath46 provides a reasonable fit near the maximum of @xmath44 ( although",
    "not the correct asymptotic limit for @xmath47 ) . using this",
    ", one finds that for @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 . from this one finds that @xmath8 has a maximum at @xmath51 and therefore that the maximum for @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 can be related to the maximum of @xmath32 which is at @xmath54 .",
    "therefore the maximum in @xmath8 is directly proportional to the maximum in @xmath32 and the comoving distance @xmath25 as long as @xmath55 .",
    "a full - sky supernova sample has both drawbacks and advantages compared with possible galaxy redshift surveys for probing the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "the major advantage is that there is no need to know the completeness function of the survey very accurately and that the effective survey volume can be very large using only a relatively small number of objects .",
    "however , this also means that it is difficult to probe features on small scales because of the sparseness of the sample . in this regard",
    "supernova surveys are fairly similar to surveys like the sloan digital sky survey luminous red galaxy survey ( sdss - lrg ) @xcite in which a relatively sparse sample of very bright galaxies is used .",
    "the velocity survey is not affected by bias between baryonic and dark matter , because it is the full matter distribution that sources the velocity field . together with the lack of sensitivity to completeness it means that supernova velocity surveys are excellent probes of the amplitude of fluctuations , i.e.  @xmath1 . given enough statistics they can also be used to probe the shape parameter , @xmath56 , of the matter power spectrum which is related to the @xmath57 and @xmath53 parameters in eq .  [ eq : pspec ] , and to @xmath58 ( see @xcite for a first attempt at probing @xmath56 using present supernova data ) .",
    "in section [ sec : cosmo ] we study the sensitivity to @xmath1 and @xmath58 of mock supernova surveys and find in particular that @xmath1 can be very well constrained .",
    "to make a forecast of what can be measured with future supernova catalogues we construct mock catalogues using a refined version of the formalism in @xcite .",
    "first , we generate a sample with @xmath59 supernovae , and distribute them in a redshift bins .",
    "the supernovae are sampled proportionally to density in a large scale n - body simulation ( in @xcite it was shown that the results are only weakly dependent on the exact distribution as long as it is semi - random ) . from this simulated dataset",
    "we calculate the angular velocity power spectrum in the different redshift bins from weighted least squares fits of spherical harmonic functions to the radial velocities using the method of singular value decomposition .",
    "the multipole expansion is terminated at @xmath60 , in order to keep the number of degrees of freedom larger than the number of fitted coefficients , @xmath61 , ( and to keep the solution practical in terms of cpu time ) .    to get a handle on cosmic variance",
    "we repeat the procedure 40 times for differently located observers , and to understand how noise affect the measurement we add a gaussian noise of @xmath62 to the magnitude of the supernovae and redo the analysis 900 times per observer .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] we show the volume averaged angular power spectrum calculated from the n - body simulation on a thin shell using healpix @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to what one would find for an infinitely large supernova sample , assuming that there are no errors on the individual supernovae , and that they all are placed at exactly the same distance .      when comparing the true ensemble averaged angular power spectrum with that derived from a specific finite sample of supernovae ,",
    "various errors are introduced .",
    "there is a _ luminosity error _ from the combined error in both apparent and absolute magnitudes of the individual supernovae . then there is a difference between an angular power spectrum , sampled by supernovae in a redshift bin of finite thickness , even in the absence of errors , and the true underlying angular power spectrum .",
    "we call it the _ geometric error_. it depends only on the specific geometry , or angular distribution , of the supernova sample , and the thickness of the bin",
    ". finally , at low @xmath26 and small distances the error will be dominated by _ cosmic variance _ ( see figure  [ fig : fig3 ] for a breakdown of the error budget in two specific redshift bins ) .",
    "+    to understand the statistical properties , and compensate for the noise , we make two independent set of mock catalogues of observations with different synthetic observers .",
    "the first is used to draw mock observers , while the second is used to model the noise , and subtract it from the mock observers .",
    "this is done to mimic real observations , where there are no correlations between the observations and the mock catalogues used to model the noise .",
    "for each observer in the second set of catalogues we measure the true angular power spectrum , and the angular power spectra derived from a given number of supernovae , with and without noise included .",
    "this gives us a robust prediction for the angular power spectra of the luminosity error and the geometric error , as well as the variances on the two types of errors .",
    "comparing volume averaged underlying power spectra from different observers we find the scatter from cosmic variance . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] we show the three different types of error terms for the three different mock surveys , which will be described in detail below .",
    "it can be seen that the luminosity error eventually begins to dominate at high @xmath26 , while the geometric error is mostly important when considering small number of supernovae . at low @xmath26",
    "the error from cosmic variance dominates completely , as expected .      when considering a mock observation , for very low @xmath26",
    "the true angular power spectrum can easily be recovered . however ,",
    "for large @xmath26 the geometric error is considerable .",
    "this phenomenon occurs because there are `` holes '' in the sky coverage ( this is discussed in detail in @xcite ) .",
    "these holes lead to leaks of power between different @xmath26 modes ( the spherical harmonics restricted to the positions of the supernovae are no longer orthogonal functions ) .",
    "as noted in @xcite a very important quantity is the size of the largest holes in the distribution of supernovae on the sky .",
    "we define a hole at a given point @xmath63 on the sphere as the largest circle , which can be drawn around that point without encompassing any supernovae .",
    "the hole can be quantified in terms of the angle @xmath64 of that sphere . for a random point distribution on the sky the area - averaged size of holes",
    "must then be proportional to @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the number of supernovae in a given redshift bin . in figure",
    "[ fig : holes ] we show that this relation holds exactly when averaged over many realisations .",
    "however , the size of the largest hole drops as roughly @xmath67 ( as can be seen from figure  [ fig : holes ] ) . in the region of interest",
    "this quantity is also a factor 3 - 4 larger than the average hole size .    since the largest holes are most problematic in the sense of loss of orthogonality of the spherical harmonics it would be highly desirable with a survey strategy , which attempts to minimise the largest holes rather than the average size of holes .",
    "quantitatively this means a distribution on the sphere , which is as homogeneous as possible for a given number of supernovae .",
    "the survey telescopes supply us with light curves for a set of supernovae , for a subset of host galaxies known redshifts can be found in galaxy catalogues and the literature , and then the question is which of the remaining host galaxies to measure redshifts for , to best reconstruct the radial velocity field . because we need the redshift of the host galaxy and not the supernova itself , the observing strategy can be decided at a later time when a large sample of supernova have already been observed and the angular distribution is known .",
    "we have tested different geometrical point measurements of radial velocity fields with a known angular power spectrum , and found that a regular homogeneous point distribution , such as a healpix distribution @xcite , consistently reconstructs the power spectra with smallest errors .",
    "unfortunately nature is not regular , but given the realities of a semi - random distribution of @xmath66 supernovae on the sky in each redshift bin to draw from , it is possible to make an almost regular distribution , containing only @xmath68 supernovae , where typically @xmath69 .    to test our algorithm ,",
    "we have first made mock catalogues of supernovae from an n - body simulation , by selecting an observer at random , but following the mass distribution ; and then selecting @xmath59 supernovae at random .",
    "the probability of selecting a given supernova is proportional to the matter density in the bin .",
    "then our algorithm proceeds as follows ",
    "applied to the separate redshift bins of the individual mock catalogues :    * a random subset containing @xmath70 of the points are drawn from the parent distribution of @xmath66 supernovae in the redshift bin .",
    "they correspond to host galaxies with known redshifts . * the supernova , outside the subset , with the maximal minimum angular distance to the already selected supernovae",
    "is added to the subset ( a redshift is measured for the host galaxy of this supernova ) . *",
    "the last point is iterated adding new supernovae until @xmath68 of the points have been selected .",
    "the resulting distribution is homogeneous but irregular , resembling a glass distribution ( see figure  [ fig : glassdist ] ) .",
    "the distribution of holes , or , more precisely , the minimum distance from a given point on the sky , to a host galaxy , for a set of glass supernovae , compared to a random set , is characterised by having approximately the same average distance to a supernova , but no big holes in the angular distribution . using only a quarter of the supernovae",
    ", it is competitive with the parent random distribution .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : glasshist ] , and the variance on the geometric error in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ) .      to estimate how precisely cosmological parameters",
    "can be measured we will use three different datasets in the following :    * a `` full '' dataset containing @xmath71 supernovae , distributed randomly according to mass in the n - body simulations .",
    "this corresponds to three years of full sky coverage by survey telescopes , with follow up observations on the redshift of all host galaxies .",
    "the maximum redshift is @xmath72 , corresponding to @xmath73 and the data is analysed in six redshift bins . * a `` glass '' dataset of @xmath74 supernovae , constructed from the full dataset using 25% of the supernovae , and the algorithm described above in this section . * a `` small '' dataset which contains @xmath74 supernovae , distributed according to mass in the n - body simulations .    using the average power spectra of both the geometric and the luminosity errors to correct the power spectrum of a single mock observation , we are able to probe the power spectrum up to @xmath10 at distances of @xmath75 ( see figure  [ fig : rng7125_149 ] ) quite robustly , when the full data set is included in the analysis . in figure  [ fig:1781sne ]",
    "is shown the equivalent angular power spectra using the glass and the small data set .",
    "it is clear that both the overall quality and the systematic of the angular power spectrum are greatly enhanced by using a glass distribution .",
    "notice in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] , how the variance in the geometric error of the glass supernovae is comparable to that of the parent full data set , and at the same level as cosmic variance , while the variances in both the geometric and the luminosity error from the small set is significantly higher for @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the redshift bin centered at @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the reason why this `` glass '' distribution works so well is exactly because it is close to being homogeneous , i.e.  it has no large holes .",
    "from our mock survey out to @xmath72 we have tested the ability to probe the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath1 which are directly related to the shape and amplitude of the matter power spectrum around the peak .",
    "specifically we obtained our best model estimate of the observed radial velocity angular power spectrum @xmath80 , including cosmic variance , geometrical sampling noise , and the luminosity scatter of the supernovae , as the average of 900 supernova mock surveys performed by 40 differently located observers .",
    "as the probability density of @xmath81 is exponential ( @xmath82 with 2 degrees of freedom ) the @xmath83 likelihood function for a given mock survey within a specific redshift bin is given by @xmath84\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the calculated angular power spectrum for the specific redshift shell .",
    "the total likelihood function is obtained as the product of the likelihood functions for all redshift bins .    in figure  [ fig:2dcontour ]",
    "we show 2d contours of the likelihood function based on a fiducial model with @xmath85 , @xmath86 . in figure  [ fig:1dcontour ]",
    "we show the corresponding 1d likelihood function marginalised over the other parameter .    with the small dataset a precision on @xmath1 of roughly 0.06 can be achieved , and with the glass data this is somewhat improved . it should be noted that although the difference between the `` small '' and the `` glass '' data sets is quite small in the present case it would be much larger if the intrinsic scatter , @xmath87 , could be reduced , or there were fewer supernovae in the sample . as supernovae become better calibrated standard candles the importance of the `` glass '' distribution will increase accordingly .    with the full data set",
    "the precision is roughly 0.03 at 95% c.l .",
    "this is comparable to the estimated precision for planck+lsst weak lensing @xcite .",
    "however , we stress that a more thorough parameter study should be performed for the supernova data before a direct comparison can be made with other future probes .",
    "the cosmological parameter estimates can be improved significantly by either reducing the intrinsic scatter , @xmath87 , or increasing the survey volume . going to @xmath88 is doable in the sense that the changes in apparent magnitude of supernovae are still dominated by peculiar velocities compared to lensing up to fairly large @xmath26 @xcite . in this case",
    "the total survey volume will be of order @xmath89 gpc@xmath90 .",
    "this is comparable to the sdss - lrg effective volume of @xmath91 gpc@xmath90 @xcite because the supernova survey is full - sky , and the number of objects will be larger than the number of measured lrg galaxies .     +   +",
    "we have performed detailed numerical studies of how future type ia supernova surveys can be used to probe the large scale velocity field of the local universe out to redshifts @xmath92 .",
    "our approach was to use high resolution n - body simulations of structure formation . from these simulations we created many synthetic data sets and used a realistic analysis pipeline to extract the angular velocity power spectrum at different redshifts for each data set .",
    "these velocity power spectra are directly related to the underlying matter power spectrum because the velocity flows are caused by the underlying gravitational potential .",
    "indeed , one of the main advantages of the presently proposed technique is that it directly probes the gravitational potential , unlike galaxy surveys that measure the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "this quantity is related to the matter power spectrum only via a scale dependent bias parameter . in this regard",
    "future large scale measurements of the velocity power spectrum using type ia supernovae are similar to the future large scale weak lensing measurements , which also probe the gravitational potential directly .",
    "both probes are complementary to galaxy surveys and combining either with a large scale galaxy survey offers a powerful method for extracting the bias parameter",
    ". it will indeed be very interesting to investigate the interplay between future large scale galaxy surveys and supernova surveys in more detail .    because the velocity power spectrum measured with type ia supernovae is directly related to the underlying matter power spectrum it is particularly useful for probing the amplitude of fluctuations on scales of a few hundred mpc , usually quantified by the parameter @xmath1 . using synthetic data sets constructed for different cosmological models we performed a simple likelihood analysis based on a fiducial model with @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and found that @xmath1 could realistically be measured with a precision of 3 - 5% ( 95% c.l . ) .",
    "this is comparable to the estimated precision of future weak lensing measurements .",
    "furthermore , the precision can be improved significantly by either increasing the survey volume or reducing the intrinsic uncertainty of each supernova .",
    "much work is still needed in order to accurately gauge the potential of future large scale surveys of low - redshift supernovae for cosmology . however",
    ", the present study clearly shows that such surveys , with a relatively small observational effort , can be competitive with other cosmological probes , which will be available in the next decade .",
