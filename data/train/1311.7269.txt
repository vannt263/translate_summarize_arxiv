    "<S> the alice detector provides excellent capabilities to study quarkonium production at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . </S>",
    "<S> heavy quarkonia , bound states of charm or beauty quark anti - quark pairs such as the @xmath0 , are expected to be produced by initial hard processes . </S>",
    "<S> thus they will provide insight into the earliest and hottest stages of aa collisions where the formation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is expected . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , high - precision data from pp collisions represent an essential baseline for the measurement of nuclear modifications in heavy - ions and serve also as a crucial test for several models of quarkonium hadroproduction . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the study of pa collisions allows to investigate nuclear modifications due to cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects . in alice , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 were measured in pp and pb  pb collisions down to @xmath1 = 0 via their di - electron decay channel in the central barrel ( @xmath2 0.8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> results on the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath3 ) at central rapidities in pb  </S>",
    "<S> pb collisions at @xmath4 tev will be shown and their implications discussed . </S>",
    "<S> a separation of the prompt and non - prompt components is also possible down to @xmath1 of the @xmath0 of 2 gev/@xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> the production of heavy quarkonia involves both perturbative and non - perturbative mechanisms of quantum - chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) . in proton - proton collisions , </S>",
    "<S> several models @xcite attempted to describe the quarkonia production , but failed in reproducing simultaneously cross - sections , polarization , transverse momentum and rapidity dependence as measured at the tevatron @xcite and rhic @xcite colliders . </S>",
    "<S> results in proton - proton collision at the new lhc energies have provided additional constraints to those models as well as the baseline reference for aa analyses . at the high temperatures and large energy densities reached in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , the matter consists of deconfined quarks and gluons , in the state referred to as `` quark - gluon - plasma '' ( qgp ) @xcite . according to the prediction by matsui and satz @xcite , in the deconfined medium formed in nucleus - nucleus collisions quarkonium production </S>",
    "<S> is suppressed relative to that in proton - proton collisions due to the color analogue of the debye screening mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the observable to quantify the nuclear medium effects is the so - called `` nuclear modification factor '' @xmath3 , defined as @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the nuclear overlap function determined by glauber model calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 suppression observed at sps and rhic @xcite is not completely understood yet . </S>",
    "<S> open points are in particular the observation of a similar @xmath0 suppression at the two different centre - of - mass energies and a stronger suppression at forward - rapidity ( @xmath840% ) compared to mid - rapidity at rhic . </S>",

    "<S> the interpretation of the experimental results is still under debate due to the large experimental uncertainty on the total @xmath9 production cross section , which prevents more precise model calculations , as well as the lack of an exhaustive understanding of cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects , strongly dependent on the centre - of - mass energy of the system and determined from pa collisions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , other important contributions are @xmath0 from the decays of higher mass charmonium states ( e.g. @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and beauty hadrons ( non - prompt @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , measuring the fraction of non - prompt @xmath0 , @xmath12 , gives access to the @xmath3 of both prompt and non - prompt produced @xmath0 mesons and the latter reflects directly the nuclear modification factor of beauty hadrons . according to the qcd predictions </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the parton energy loss in the qgp implies the following hierarchy in the measured @xmath3 : @xmath13 . </S>",

    "<S> the focus of this paper is on the results obtained at mid - rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> the main tracking detectors used in this analysis are the inner tracking system ( its ) , which allows for the measurement of the @xmath0 fraction from beauty hadron decays , and the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , which is used for tracking and electron identification via specific energy deposition measurement . </S>",
