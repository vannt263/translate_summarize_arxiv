    "random matrix theory ( rmt ) , @xcite , @xcite has found much success as phenomenological models describing a wide variety of physical systems , from discretization of moduli space @xcite , to the statistics of the cells in the skin of a cucumber @xcite .",
    "rmt is the study of eigenvalues derived from random ensembles of matrices with stochastic elements specified by a probability density , @xmath1 , in the space of matrices .",
    "most interest is in examining the properties of the eigenvalues induced from the transformation to the eigenvalue basis .",
    "early work consisted of using real symmetric , hermitian , unitary , and real quarternion matrices @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues of which are either real or unimodular , ( and termed one dimensional eigenvalues here ) .",
    "recently several groups have begun to consider physical applications of matrix models composed of complex matrices . introduced in the early sixties by ginibre @xcite it took decades for others to consider applications . as the probability distribution is not invariant under similarity transformations the diagonalizing parameters must be integrated out by brute force . it was found that only a distribution with a gaussian weight ( ginibre ensemble ) could be solved .",
    "the ginibre ensemble was later found to exhibit cubic eigenvalue repulsion in the complex plane , @xcite @xcite .",
    "such models are of interest in characterizations of quantum chaos .",
    "cubic quasi - energy level repulsion is a key signature of classical chaos within a quantum dissipative system , as defined by haake @xcite .",
    "normal matrices are discussed in most matrix theory texts , ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "defined by the sole constraint that they commute with their adjoint , they have the property of being the most general matrix that can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation .",
    "the normal matrix model was first introduced in showing how the laughlin wavefunction could be modeled by it and offered some generalizations to inhomogeneous fields @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the statistics of eigenvalues of random normal matrices were first explored .    in this paper the universality of cubic eigenvalue repulsion in the complex plane for ensembles of random normal matrices will be shown . in section",
    "ii the probability distribution in the space of matrices , all correlation functions , and the eigenvalue densities will be obtained . in section",
    "iii the level spacing statistics of the eigenvalues obtained will be derived .",
    "the term level spacing is borrowed from the wigner - dyson ensembles and will represent here the spacing in the complex plane . in section iv eigenvalues of numerical generated normal matrices will be studied and compared to the analytical results .",
    "we begin by defining the joint probability distribution ( jpd ) within the space of normal matrices , @xmath2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] only potentials which are hermitian will be considered , @xmath3 . as a result the joint probability distribution for the eigenvalues will be rotationally symmetric in the complex plane .",
    "normal matrices are the most general matrices which can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation , @xmath4 , so that the measure and the weight are invariant .",
    "thus it is simple to derive the jacobian for the transformation to the eigenvalues .    proceeding analogously to the hermitian matrix case @xcite , the metric in the space of normal matrices is defined as ,    @xmath5 \\nonumber \\\\   & = &   tr(\\bf{ud(u^{\\dag}zu)u^{\\dag}ud(u^{\\dag}z^{\\ast}u)u^{\\dag}})\\nonumber \\\\ & = & tr(\\bf{[ds , z][ds , z^{\\ast}]}+(\\bf{[ds , z]dz^{\\ast } } + \\bf { dz[ds , z^{\\ast } ] } ) + \\vert \\bf{dz}\\vert^2 ) \\nonumber \\\\   &   = & c \\sum_{i < k}\\vert ds_{ik}(z_k - z_i)\\vert^2 + \\sum_i \\vert dz_i\\vert^2 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 is antihermitian and @xmath7 is an overall constant .    using the standard riemannian volume form with this metric",
    "we get ,    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the volume of the unitary group @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the well known van der monde determinant ,    latexmath:[\\ ] ]    where @xmath87 . under the optimization algorithm",
    "it is found that many eigenvalues `` leak '' out into the complex plane .",
    "adding a further constraint to keep the eigenvalues within a radius of @xmath88 lengthens the generation time dramatically .",
    "therefore , for this preliminary study the eigenvalues were `` pruned '' , those falling outside @xmath89 were neglected , ( the number was choosen so that edge effects would be eliminated as well ) .",
    "overall , about one third of the eigenvalues were pruned .",
    "the results are displayed in figure [ fig : num6 ] .",
    "the slight deviation of the numerical and analytical results for large @xmath90 is due to the leakage of eigenvalues .",
    "the small @xmath90 behavior is not affected by the leakage .",
    "it is found that changing the initial conditions has little effect on @xmath91 .",
    "it is also observed that lowering the the threshold for the error function by a factor of ten has a negligible effect .",
    "it has been shown that cubic repulsion of eigenvalues obtained from random normal matrices experience a minimum of cubic repulsion in the complex plane .",
    "even though normal matrices are subsets of complex matrices we have demonstrated that gaussian normal matrix models yield the same results as the ginibre ensemble of complex matrices .",
    "one can define ensembles of complex matrices with weights invariant under similiarity transformations , ( see appendix b of @xcite ) .",
    "these ensembles will fall under the @xmath92 and experience a minimum of quartic repulsion .",
    "( getting analytical results for the statistics of the eigenvalues is difficult however ) .",
    "ensembles of complex matrices with weight functions invariant under unitary transformations other than the gaussian are not factorable and are not amenable to analytical analysis . for normal matrices we can define identical ensembles to complex models invariant under similiarity transformations and as well define a wide range of ensembles invariant under unitary transformations , ( as demonstrated in this paper ) .",
    "the special case of real normal matrices was also shown to experience cubic repulsion in the complex plane .",
    "as well , there are even more significant differences between random normal matrices and , more traditional , random matrix models composed of hermitian , unitary , and real symmetric matrices , themselves being subsets of normal matrices .",
    "although numerical generation of normal matrices is not as straightforward as for other types of matrices we have shown that analytical results are often much easier to obtain .",
    "what numerical information we could obtain does agree with the theoretical result .",
    "it is a little disappointing that universality , in the sense of brezin and zee @xcite , is not found for normal matrix models .",
    "the simple scaling arguments that lead to universal kernels for other types of matrices do not work here .",
    "it may be possible to rescale @xmath90 to obtain a universal spacing distribution @xmath93 .",
    "this allows the potential of analytically exploring the statistics of complex eigenvalues which was not possible before .",
    "another interesting feature is the closed form expressions for the two point correlation functions in nge , laguerre ( @xmath94 ) , and legendre ensembles in the infinite matrix limit , ( see table [ table ] ) .    in terms of physical applications",
    "it should be noted that results using the ginibre ensemble of complex matrices can be duplicated with the normal gaussian ensemble .",
    "such work includes , modeling cellular structures by le caer and ho @xcite , two dimensional quantum gravity by morris @xcite , and haake s work on generators of quantum dynamics for systems with dissipation @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown , @xcite , that haake s generator of dissipation , @xmath95 , in @xcite @xcite , is properly represented by a normal matrix rather than a complex one .",
    "this result strengthens the idea that the eigenvalues of these generators universally exhibit cubic repulsion when dissipative dynamics is present .",
    "the results obtained in this work give a more complete picture of the statistics of eigenvalues from random matrices .",
    "the normal matrix model , a link between the dyson ensembles and the ginibre ensemble , has a rich structure where interesting results can still be found .",
