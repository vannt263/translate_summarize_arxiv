    "@xcite    by `` exact renormalization group equation ( erge ) '' , we mean the continuous ( i.e. not discrete ) realization of the wilson renormalization group ( rg ) transformation of the action in which no approximation is made and also no expansion is involved with respect to some small parameter of the action . its formulation",
    " under a differential form  is known since the early seventies @xcite .",
    "however , due to its complexity ( an integro - differential equation ) , its study calls for the use of approximation ( and/or truncation ) methods . for a long time it was natural to use a perturbative approach ( based on the existence of a small parameter like the famous @xmath0-expansion for example ) .",
    "but , the standard perturbative field theory ( e.g. see @xcite ) turned out to be more efficient and , in addition the defenders of the nonperturbative approach have turned towards the discrete formulation of the rg due to the problem of the  stiff  differential equation ( see a discussion following a talk given by wegner @xcite ) .",
    "this is why it is only since the middle of the eighties that substantial studies have been carried out via :    * the truncation procedures in the scaling field method @xcite ( extended studies of @xcite ) * the explicit consideration of the local potential approximation @xcite and of the derivative expansion @xcite * an appealing use , for field theoreticians , of the erge @xcite    in the nineties there has been a rapid growth of studies in all directions , accounting for scalar ( or vector ) fields , spinor , gauge fields , finite temperature , supersymmetry , gravity , etc ...    in this paper we report on progress in the handling of the erge . due to the abundance of the literature on the subject and because this is an introductory report , we have considered in detail the various versions of the erge only in the scalar ( or vector ) case .",
    "this critical review must also be seen as an incitement to look at the original papers of which we give a list as complete as possible .",
    "let us mention that the erge is almost ignored in most of the textbooks on the renormalization group except notably in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "there are four representations of the erge : the functional differential equation , the functional integral , the infinite set of partial differential equations for the couplings @xmath1 ( eq .",
    "11.19 of @xcite ) which are popularly known because they introduce the famous `` beta '' functions @xmath2 : @xmath3 and the infinite hierarchy of the ordinary differential equations for the scaling fields @xmath4 @xcite ( the rg - scale parameter @xmath5 is defined in section [ notations ] and the scaling fields @xmath4 in section [ seclrgt ] ) .    in this review",
    "we shall only consider the functional differential representation of the erge .",
    "there is not a unique form of the erge , each form of the equation is characterized by the way the momentum cutoff @xmath6 is introduced .",
    "( in perturbative rg , this kind of dependence is known as the regularization - scheme dependence or `` scheme dependence '' in short @xcite . )",
    "the important point is that the various forms of the erge embody a unique physical content in the sense that they all preserve the same physics at large distances and , via the recourse to a process of limit , yield the same physics at small distances ( continuum limits ) .",
    "the object of this part is to present the main equations used in the literature and connections between their formally ( but not necessarily practically ) equivalent forms .",
    "we do not derive them in detail here since one may find the derivations in several articles or reviews ( that we indicate below ) .",
    "although the ( wilson ) renormalization group theory owes much to the statistical physics as recently stressed by m. e. fisher @xcite we adopt here the notations and the language of field theory .    before considering explicitly the various forms of the erge ( in sections [ wherge]-[legendresec ] ) , we find it essential to fix the notations and to remind some fundamental aspects of the rg .",

    "hence we introduce an adjustable dimension of the field , @xmath78 , which controls the scaling transformation of the field : @xmath79 for the fourier transformation , we have :    @xmath80    since the dimension of any dimensioned ( in the classical meaning for @xmath35 ) quantity is expressed in term of a momentum scale , we use @xmath6 to reduce all dimensioned quantities into dimensionless quantities . in the following",

    "most certainly no mass can be defined right at a fixed point @xcite ( there is scale invariance there and a mass would set a scale ) but at the same time the theory would also have no useful parameter at all ( no scale dependent parameter ) since , by definition , right at a fixed point nothing changes , nothing happens , there is nothing to describe .",
    "an important aspect of the wilson continuum limit is the resulting self - similarity emphasized rightly in several occasions by morris and collaborators @xcite ( see section [ sectxtbrgt ] ) .",

    "the convergence of the method has been studied in @xcite [ with eq .",
    "( [ eqlpa - wh ] ) ] and further in @xcite [ with the legendre effective action ( [ morrislpa ] ) ] where it is shown that the truncation scheme associated to the expansion around the minimum of the potential ( called co - moving scheme in @xcite ) actually does not converge but finally , at a certain large order , leads also to an oscillatory behavior .",
    "we have seen that the estimates of the critical exponents in the lpa depend on the erge chosen ( see section [ ce - lpa ] ) .",
    "it is thought @xcite however that for a given erge , the estimates should not depend on the form of the cutoff function ( the dependence would occur only at next - to - leading order in the derivative expansion @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the truncation in powers of the field may violate this `` scheme independence '' and affect the convergence of the truncation .",
    "it is the issue studied in @xcite with three smooth cutoff functions : hyperbolic tangent , exponential and power - law .",
    "an improvement of the convergence is proposed by adjustment of the smoothness of the cutoff function .      despite its relative defect in precise quantitative predictions , the local potential approximation of the erge is more than simply the zeroth order of a systematic expansion in powers of derivatives ( see section [ secderiv ] ) . in the first place it is a pedagogical example of the way infinitely many degrees of freedom are accounted for in rg theory .",
    "almost all the characteristics of the rg theory are involved in the lpa .",

    "but , when @xmath77 is small ( especially for @xmath148 and @xmath160 ) , one expects the approximation to be qualitatively correct on all aspects of the rg theory .",
    "one may thus trust the results presented in section [ fplpa ] on the search for nontrivial fixed points in four and three dimensions .",
    "it is a matter of fact that much of studies on rg theory are limited to the vicinity of a fixed point .",
    "this is easily understood due to the universality of many quantities ( exponents , amplitude ratios , scaled equation of state , etc@xmath511 ) that occurs there .",
    "however this limitation greatly curtails the possibilities that rg theory offers .",
    "the fixed points and their local properties ( relevant and irrelevant directions ) are not the only interesting aspects of the rg theory .",
    "let us simply quote , as an example , the crossover phenomenon which reflects the competition between two fixed points .",
    "but what is worse than a simple limitation in the use of the theory , is the resulting misinterpretation of the theory .",
    "this is particularly true with respect to the definition of the continuum limit of field theory and its relation to the study of critical phenomena .",
    "let us specify a bit this point ( more details may be found in @xcite )    it is often expressed that the continuum limit of field theory is defined `` at '' a fixed point and that it is sufficient to look at its relevant directions to get the renormalized parameters , i.e. a simple linear study of the rg theory in the vicinity of the fixed point would be sufficient to define the continuum limit ( see for example in @xcite ) .",
    "this is not wrong but incomplete and , actually void of practical meaning .",
    "indeed it is not enough emphasized ( or understood ) in the literature that , for example , although defined `` at '' the gaussian fixed point , the field theoretic approach to critical phenomena @xcite is finally applied `` at '' the wilson - fisher fixed point which , in three dimensions , lies far away from the gaussian fixed point .",
    "then if the renormalized coupling of the @xmath512-field theory was only defined by the linear properties of the rg theory in the vicinity of the gaussian fixed point , one would certainly not be able to discover the nontrivial wilson - fisher fixed point by perturbative means .",
    "actually , the relevant directions of a fixed point provide us with exclusively the number and the nature of the renormalized parameters involved in the continuum limit .",
    "but the most important step of the continuum limit is the determination of the actual scale dependence ( say , the beta functions ) of those renormalized parameters .",
    "it is at this step that the recourse to rg theory actually makes sense : the attractive rg flow `` _ that emanates out from the fixed point along the relevant direction _ @xcite '' results from the effect of infinitely many degrees of freedom and the problem of determining this flow is nonperturbative in essence . in the wilson space @xmath513 of the couplings @xmath514 ,",
    "the flow in the continuum runs along a submanifold ( of dimension one if the fixed point has only one relevant direction ) which is entirely plunged in @xmath515 .",
    "the writing of the corresponding action ( the `` perfect action '' @xcite ) would require the specification of infinitely many conditions on the action . because it is an hopeless task to find the `` perfect action '' , one gives up all idea of a determination of the initial absolute scale dependence and one has recourse to the process of fine tuning some parameter of the ( bare ) action in the vicinity of the ( gaussian ) fixed point ( or in the vicinity of a critical or tricritical etc .. surface in @xmath513 ) .",
    "this allows us to approach the ideal ( or `` perfect '' ) flow one is looking for and which runs along a trajectory tangent to a relevant direction . this flow is determined under a differential form ( beta function ) since the initial condition is not specified ( the `` perfect action '' is not known ) but it results from the effect of all degrees of freedom involved in the theory ( by virtue of the relevant direction ) .",
    "the simplicity of the erge in the lpa allows us to visualize the evolution of rg trajectories in the space @xmath513 of the couplings @xmath516 and thus to illustrate and qualitatively discuss many aspects directly related to the nonperturbative character of the rg theory .",
