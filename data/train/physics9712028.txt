    "the problem of treating the two - body system in a magnetic field has a long history @xcite .",
    "early on it was realized that the center of mass motion can not be separated from the internal motion .",
    "the motional electric field due to the collective motion of the system in the magnetic field gives rise to a stark term in the hamiltonian which is very similar to that arising from an external electric field .",
    "hence , both problems can be treated in a unified way .",
    "when the center of mass effects are treated correctly , the total momentum of the system @xmath0 is not a conserved quantity and a separation of the center of mass and internal motion is impossible .",
    "the pseudomomentum @xmath1 is however a conserved quantity , where @xmath0 is the total momentum and @xmath2 is the relative vector of the two oppositely charged particles with charges @xmath3@xcite . for neutral systems , one can carry out a pseudoseparation of the center of mass and internal motion , where the effective hamiltonian for the internal motion includes @xmath4-dependent terms , where @xmath4 is the eigenvalue of the pseudomomentum @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that one can account for the effect of the motion of the center of mass on the internal motion via an effective potential that is gauge independent@xcite .",
    "this potential gives rise to an outer well for certain values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which leads to delocalized states .",
    "there have been several studies of the effects of a significant stark term on the strong field behavior of one - electron atoms @xcite .",
    "recently , the gauge - invariant potential was extended to the case of positronium , where rigorous numerical results indicated that for field strengths attainable in the laboratory , one could form delocalized states of positronium@xcite .",
    "the probability density within an interparticle distance radius of hundreds of angstroms is less than @xmath6 , indicating that the rates for direct annihilation and radiative decay to lower lying states localized in the coulomb well are near zero .",
    "the existence of such delocalized states for positronium is important because it provides a mechanism for creating a stable bound state of a particle - antiparticle pair .",
    "our previous work established the existence of such a state at values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 that are attainable in the laboratory . in this paper , we attempt a more thorough investigation of the problem . in section",
    "ii , we describe the potential surface of positronium ( ps ) as a function of @xmath4 for values of the magnetic field from laboratory field strengths ( @xmath7a.u . ) up to superstrong fields ( 10 - 100 a.u . ) .",
    "we discuss qualitatively the effect of this potential on the energy spectrum .",
    "we present numerical results for select values of the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 and show that for large values of the pseudomomentum the ground state of ps becomes a delocalized state .",
    "this is an important result because it means that any ps formed under the proper conditions will be stable against annihilation . in the conclusion",
    ", we speculate on how one may obtain evidence of long - lived ps in a laboratory .",
    "throughout this paper we use atomic units :    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     the effective hamiltonian for the positronium atom in crossed electric and magnetic fields which results from the gauge invariant pseudoseparation @xcite is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the kinetic energy and @xmath10 is the potential of the relative motion .",

    "1,3 ) the energy spectrum of the system - including the ground state - is dramatically different depending on the value of @xmath5 .",
    "the bound states of the system depend not just on the potential , but also on the ionization threshold @xmath18 .",
    "when the two wells are distinct , that is , the saddle point energy is well above the ionization threshold , the bound states can be classified as ow states or mdcw states : their probability density is concentrated solely in one well .",

    "all of the states that are localized in the mdcw are pushed upward in energy with increasing @xmath4 and into the continuum ; the number of mdcw bound states decreases . the number of bound states in the outer well increases with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "however , before we reach the regime where the problem reduces to two separate wells , there is a range of @xmath4 for which _ the saddle point energy is less than the ionization threshold . _",
    "if the energy of a state is considerably less than @xmath87 , the state will be concentrated in the ow or the mdcw with very little probability in the barrier region and the above classification scheme for states is still valid . however ,",
    "if the energy of a state is close to @xmath87 , the distinction between an ow state and an mdcw states becomes murky .",
    "( it is important to remember that @xmath87 is the potential maximum in the @xmath40direction only ; the ionization threshold @xmath19 as well as the energy of the state are quantities that depend on the 3d wavefunction . ) under these very special conditions , @xmath98 , we have a third kind of state : the saddle state .      in the regime @xmath99 , but @xmath100",
    ", an interesting phenomena can occur : a mdcw state can undergo a continuous transformation into an ow state with increasing @xmath4 as the energy of the mdcw state approaches @xmath87 . the mdcw state ( see fig .",
    "4a ) will begin to leak into the classically forbidden barrier region ( see fig .",
    "the amount of tunneling through the barrier increases with increasing @xmath4 , until a saddle state forms , which has probability density in the mdcw , the barrier region and the ow ( see fig .",
    "4c ) . at even higher @xmath4 ,",
    "more and more probability density is transfered from the mdcw to the ow ( see fig .",
    "since the barrier height is increasing , the energy of the state is eventually less than @xmath87 and the state is fully delocalized in the ow ( see fig .",
    "4e ) . the range of @xmath4 over which this process occurs can vary orders of magnitude depending on the relative values of @xmath18 , @xmath87 and @xmath16 as a function of @xmath4 ( see table 1 ) .    for low magnetic fields ,",
    "the gap between the ionization threshold and the saddle point energy is already small at the critical value ; hence , the formation of saddle states is limited to a very small range of @xmath4 . for @xmath101 ,",
    "the critical value is @xmath102 and saddle point reaches the ionization threshold ( @xmath103 ) at @xmath104 .",
    "saddle states can only form over a range @xmath105 .",
    "many bound states still exist in the mdcw when the saddle point reaches the ionization threshold .",
    "in contrast , for high magnetic fields , the separation between the ionization threshold and the saddle point energy is orders of magnitude greater than what it is at low fields . for @xmath106 ,",
    "the critical value is @xmath107 and the saddle point reaches the ionization threshold at @xmath108 .",

    "the ground state of positronium will become a delocalized state at sufficiently high @xmath4 .",

    "<S> it was earlier reported [ prl * 78 * 199 , ( 1997 ) ] that long - lived excited states of positronium can be formed in crossed electric and magnetic fields at laboratory field strengths . unlike the lower - lying states that are localized in the magnetically distorted coulomb well , these long - lived states which can possess a lifetime up to many years are localized in an outer potential well that is formed for certain values of the pseudomomentum and magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the present work extends the original analysis and studies the dependence of the spectrum as a function of field strength and pseudomomentum over a wide range of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that in the limit of large pseudomomentum , the ground state of positronium atom in a magnetic field will become delocalized ; for strong fields , the binding energy of this state is quite large , resulting in a ground state that is both stable against direct annihilation and against ionization by low frequency background radiation . </S>"
