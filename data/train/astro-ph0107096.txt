    "the huge improvement in spatial resolution of _ chandra _  over previous x - ray missions is proving , like _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , to have significant impact on globular cluster astrophysics .",
    "for example , using _",
    ", 108 sources have been detected in the central 2@xmath3 of the massive globular cluster 47 tucanae ( ngc104 ; grindlay et al .",
    "2001 ) , compared to the detection of 9 central sources by _ rosat _ @xcite . these _ chandra _  sources are a mixture of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries , and active binaries , many of which have also been detected ( edmonds et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) in our extensive 8.3 day _ hst_/wfpc2 observations of this cluster @xcite .",
    "fifteen of the 20 msps detected in 47 tuc by @xcite with the parkes radio telescope have timing positions accurate to @xmath4001 ( freire et al . 2001 ; hereafter fcl01 ) , and 10 of these are detected in x - rays with the ciao program wavdetect ( errors @xmath5 ) , allowing for excellent astrometry between the radio and x - ray coordinate frames . combined with the large numbers of cvs and active binaries detected with both _",
    "chandra _  and _ hst _ , we exploit here the rare opportunity to perform astrometry at the @xmath60.1@xmath7 level between x - ray , optical , and radio observations , using only relative astrometry .    of the 8 binary msps in 47",
    "tuc with timing solutions ( fcl01 ) , 5 have companions with masses of @xmath80.150.20m@xmath9  @xcite ; by analogy with field msps these are expected to be helium white dwarfs ( he wds ) . using our precise astrometry",
    "we report here the unambiguous detection of a he wd companion to one of these msps ( psr  j0024@xmath107203u , hereafter 47 tuc u ) , the first such detection in a globular cluster .",
    "( he wds have been reported in the globular cluster ngc 6397 by cool et al .",
    "1998 , edmonds et al .",
    "1999 , and taylor et al .",
    "2001 , but none of these have yet been associated with an msp . ) the astrometry , photometry and time series for this identification are described here , along with a discussion of their consequences for the age of 47 tuc u , the nature of he wds and their cooling , and the heating effects of an msp in a close binary .",
    "we assumed the astrometric coordinate system of the msps ( based on the jpl de200 planetary ephemeris ; fcl01 ) as our reference .",
    "first , we transferred the _ chandra _",
    "coordinate frame onto the radio frame using only the relatively isolated msps with accurate _",
    "chandra _  positions ( six msps including 47 tuc u ) .",
    "we calculated and subtracted the mean positional offsets between the x - ray and radio coordinate systems and found the rms residuals were @xmath11 and @xmath12 for ra and dec respectively ( after correcting for small linear correlations between ra and ra error and dec and dec error ) .",
    "the total error of @xmath13 compares favorably with the mean predicted wavdetect error , at the relevant count levels and in the absence of background and crowding , of @xmath14 .",
    "we then fixed the _",
    "coordinate system , with positions based on the stsdas program metric , onto that of _ chandra _  using the x - ray detection of 6 cvs and active binaries found on the wf2 chip of the @xcite _ hst_/wfpc2 data ( this chip contains 4 of the 6 msps , including 47 tuc u , used to perform the radio to _ chandra",
    "_  astrometry ) .",
    "the rms residuals were found to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 , for ra and dec respectively .",
    "then , assuming the errors are random and dividing by @xmath17 , the resulting 1@xmath18 errors matching x - ray to optical are @xmath19 and @xmath20 for ra and dec , and for radio to optical are @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    using this astrometry we searched directly for msp companions in the _",
    "hst_images and found an excellent candidate for a companion to 47 tuc u ( hereafter @xmath23 ) whose position is given in table  1 .",
    "finding charts for @xmath23  ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) show the @xmath24-band and @xmath25-band images , plus the 3@xmath18 error circle for w11 ( the _ chandra _  x - ray source corresponding to 47 tuc u ) and the 3@xmath18 error ellipse for 47 tuc u. the offset between w11 and @xmath23  is @xmath26 , and between 47 tuc u and @xmath23  is @xmath27 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that @xmath23  is clearly blue , since other stars in the @xmath25 image of comparable brightness to @xmath23  are barely visible in the @xmath24 image .",
    "this impression is confirmed by our @xmath25 vs @xmath28 and @xmath25 vs @xmath29 color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) from psf - fitting photometry shown in figure [ fig2 ] ( we have transformed from _ hst _  filters to johnson - cousins using holtzman et al . 1995 ; see also table 1 ) .",
    "the star @xmath23  ( labeled ` u ' ; @xmath30 ) is blueward of the main sequence ( ms ) in both cmds , where the internal error for @xmath23  is @xmath4 0.03 mag for each filter , with absolute errors of @xmath31 mag in @xmath25 and @xmath32 and @xmath33 mag in @xmath24 , including transformation uncertainties . a likely cv is labeled ( ` 1 ' ) as are 5 blue stars ( circles ) confirmed by visual examination to be relatively bright in @xmath24 like @xmath23 .",
    "one of these blue stars is probably a co wd ( see zoccali et al .",
    "2001 ) , two others are variable and likely co wd - ms binaries and the other two are possibly also binaries . visual examination showed that the other apparently blue stars , with @xmath34 , are caused by crowding and photometric error , particularly in the crowded portions of the image nearest to the cluster center .",
    "many of the fainter stars with @xmath35 and @xmath36 are bona - fide blue stars , likely to be dominated by ms stars from the smc ( see zoccali et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the very small number of stars that are blue and detectable in each of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath32 highlights the unusual nature of @xmath23  and its likely association with 47 tuc u. with 7 such blue stars the probability ( averaged over the whole wf2 image ) of detecting one in a circular aperture of @xmath14 radius is only 9@xmath37 .",
    "the _ hst_/wfpc2 data of @xcite contain 636 @xmath25-band and 653 @xmath32-band 160 s images evenly spread over 8.3 days .",
    "typical rms noise values in fractional intensity ( gilliland et al . 2000 ) are @xmath38 at @xmath39 and @xmath40 at @xmath41 . since @xmath23  is relatively well isolated , the quality of its @xmath25 and @xmath32 time series , based on its extracted aperture of 0@xmath42 , is excellent .",
    "its rms noise values are 0.021 ( @xmath25 ) and 0.034 ( @xmath32 ) , or @xmath43 and 0.6@xmath18 away from the mean rms values for the 666 ( @xmath25 ) or 551 ( @xmath32 ) stars within 0.25 mag of @xmath23 , after iteratively removing @xmath44 outliers .",
    "we then searched for evidence of low amplitude variations in @xmath23 .",
    "lomb - scargle @xcite power spectra of the @xmath25 and @xmath32 time series for 47 tuc u are shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "this shows a peak in the @xmath25-band , at ( 2.681@xmath45hz , which is coincident with the orbital period for 47 tuc u ( @xmath46hz ) determined from radio observations .",
    "although this peak is not statistically significant in a blind search , only one other peak , when measured out to 0.45 mhz ( the ` average ' nyquist frequency ; scargle 1982 ) has a higher signal .",
    "no corresponding signal is seen in the @xmath32band .",
    "we then carried out a least - squares fit of a sinusoid to the time series , by coordinating the radio ephemeris with the optical and correcting the mid - exposure _ hst _  times to the barycenter , using the iraf task rvcorrect .",
    "we define phase@xmath47/p$ ] ( where @xmath48 is the barycentric time , @xmath49 is the time of ascending node , when the pulsar is moving with maximum velocity away from us , and @xmath50 is its orbital period ) so that when phase @xmath51 the heated hemisphere of @xmath23  is facing towards us , giving maximum light ( in a model where @xmath23  is heated by the pulsar wind ) . the derived period , time of optical maximum ( phase = 0 ) and semi ",
    "amplitude for the @xmath25-band time series are given in table 1 ( @xmath25 phase plots are shown in the lower  left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "for the ` unforced ' solution the period is 0.7@xmath18 away from the orbital radio period , and the phase is 1.9@xmath18 away from phase zero for the radio observations ( as defined above ) .",
    "the amplitude is significant at the 3.4@xmath18 level ( the significance of this measurement is @xmath52 3.4@xmath18 when the @xmath61/10 chance probability of the radio and optical phases aligning is considered ) . by forcing the period and phase of the sinusoidal variation to equal the radio values ( the ` forced ' solution ) , an amplitude of 0.0033@xmath530.0012 is derived , significant at the 2.8@xmath18 level ; a forced fit in the @xmath32-band yielded 0.0013@xmath530.0018 .",
    "marginal evidence is found for variation in the much more limited ( 26 images of length 160 s ",
    "900 s ) @xmath24-band data ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .    to test whether this small variation in @xmath25 is intrinsic to @xmath23  rather than a larger variation from a nearby fainter star we examined the power spectra of 3 fainter stars ( with @xmath54 ) lying within @xmath55 of @xmath23 .",
    "none showed significant variations .",
    "we also examined a ` phase difference ' image derived by adding together images where the phase of @xmath23  is within 0.07 of 1.0 and subtracting similar images for phase values of 0.5@xmath530.07 .",
    "this procedure gave a stellar - shaped source coincident , at the 0.5 pixel ( @xmath56 ) error level , with @xmath23 , exactly as expected if @xmath23  is the only star varying with the radio period and phase .",
    "we therefore conclude we have made a solid detection of variability from @xmath23  at the expected period and phase , confirming it as the 47 tuc u companion .",
    "neutron stars ( nss ) in binary radio pulsar systems have average masses of @xmath57m@xmath9  @xcite . for 47  tuc",
    "u , considering a ns mass 1.30m@xmath9  and an edge - on orbit ( inclination @xmath58 ) , we derive from the mass function a minimum mass for @xmath23  of @xmath59  = 0.120m@xmath9 .",
    "this 4.3ms pulsar has an approximate characteristic age of @xmath60 gyr and spin - down luminosity of @xmath61  @xmath62 erg s@xmath63 ( grindlay et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "such recycled pulsars may have accreted significant amounts of mass , and for every additional 0.05m@xmath9  for the ns , @xmath59 s minimum value increases by 0.003m@xmath9",
    ".    we now compare the @xmath0 colors of @xmath23  with expectations from h and he wd models to test whether it is a plausible he wd and if so , to estimate @xmath64 , log g , and the mass and age of this star .",
    "we focus on comparisons with the models of serenelli et al .",
    "( 2001 ; hereafter sar01 ) , who conveniently provide broadband color information .",
    "they find that for masses ranging from 0.18 m@xmath9  to 0.41 m@xmath9 , diffusion - induced hydrogen - shell flashes take place which deplete the h envelope and cause evolution to proceed relatively quickly , while the he wds with mass @xmath65m@xmath9  evolve much more slowly because they retain relatively thick hydrogen envelopes . @xcite and sar01",
    "show that this dichotomy between low and high mass he wds removes the discrepancies between msp characteristic ages and wd cooling ages for several field systems including psrs j0034@xmath100534 , j1012 + 5307 , j1713 + 0747 and b1855 + 09 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the he wd cooling curves of sar01 for masses of 0.169  0.406 m@xmath9 . since @xmath23  lies well to the red of the wd cooling sequence of @xcite in both cmds , it is unlikely to be a @xmath60.55 m@xmath9  co wd .",
    "the lowest mass models of sar01 offer much better agreement , and since @xmath23  falls slightly to the red of the lowest mass sequence we infer that @xmath59  @xmath66m@xmath9(implying @xmath67 ) .",
    "this would mean that 47 tuc u is similar to the field system psr j1012 + 5307 , with period = 0.605d and mass @xmath68m@xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the 0.17m@xmath9  sar01 model with the same absolute magnitude as @xmath23  has @xmath64=11000 k , log g = 5.6 , luminosity = 0.14 @xmath69 , a radius  can be estimated accurately just from the @xmath29 color @xcite , and the luminosity using only the @xmath25 magnitude and @xmath64 .",
    "] of @xmath70 cm and an age of @xmath71 gyr .",
    "this cooling age is somewhat less than the characteristic age estimated by grindlay et al .",
    "( 2001 , in preparation ) and is at the low end of the conservative limits set by fcl01 of @xmath72 gyr . only the lowest mass model of sar01 remains relatively bright at these significant cooling ages , while all of the higher mass wds reach much fainter levels ( @xmath73 ) at a cooling age of @xmath74 gyr ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "our data therefore provides tentative support for the evolutionary calculations of sar01 , in particular for the dichotomy in ages between different mass he wds . for comparison ,",
    "the he wd models of @xcite ( for all masses ) reach @xmath75=11.5 or fainter after 1 gyr , for a relatively thick hydrogen envelope of @xmath76m@xmath9 .",
    "accretion should have ceased in the 47 tuc u system , to explain the faint x - ray luminosity ( @xmath77erg s@xmath63 ; grindlay et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) and the constant , uneclipsed radio emission ( fcl01 ) . using the roche - lobe formula from @xcite ( @xmath78^{1/3}}$ ] , where @xmath79 is the roche - lobe radius , and @xmath80 is the binary separation ) , the wd radius given above ( for @xmath59  = 0.17 m@xmath9 ; @xmath81 ) and the binary separation from kepler s third law , @xmath23  should under  fill its roche lobe by a factor of @xmath66 . therefore ,",
    "as expected , no accretion will be occurring .    assuming that the msp radiates its wind isotropically , and that @xmath82 , then the @xmath61  estimate implies that the pulsar energy intercepted by @xmath23  should be @xmath83erg s@xmath63 or 0.013@xmath84 the luminosity of @xmath23  ( assuming that the spin - down energy is re - radiated as a black - body , we derive a temperature of @xmath85k , peaked at @xmath86 , for the re - radiated emission ) .",
    "therefore , assuming that only one side of @xmath23  is heated we should see a relative variability amplitude of @xmath87 , allowing a factor of 1.4 decrease in possible amplitude because of the inclination .",
    "this is only slightly larger than the amplitude of the detected @xmath25-band variation , implying a high efficiency factor for re - radiation of the pulsar s wind as optical emission .",
    "however , because the variability expected from the effects of heating is small , we infer that the possible ( 2.3@xmath18 ) much larger amplitude variation in the @xmath24band is either spurious or evidence for a separate source of emission .",
    "we have identified the binary pulsar 47 tuc u with an optically variable blue star with period and phase of maximum light in excellent agreement with that expected from the precise radio ephemeris ( fcl01 ) .",
    "the companion is likely to be a he white dwarf with @xmath59  @xmath40.17 m@xmath9 , based on the published models of sar01 .",
    "although the optical time series photometry reported here is unlikely to be improved upon soon , time resolved spectroscopy with _",
    "hst_/stis of @xmath23appears promising . the co - added doppler corrected spectrum could be used to spectroscopically determine @xmath64  and log g , and hence @xmath59  ( see e.g. edmonds et al .",
    "combining @xmath59  with the radial velocity amplitude of @xmath23  ( @xmath88 ) and the measured @xmath89 from the radio measurements would give a direct measurement of @xmath90 .",
