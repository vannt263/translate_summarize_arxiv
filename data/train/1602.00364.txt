    "neutrino - less double beta decays ( 0@xmath1 ) are crucial for studies of the neutrino ( @xmath2 ) properties and especially the majorana mass character of the neutrino . with the given current knowledge from neutrino oscillation experiments ,",
    "the typical mass regions to be explored are about 45 - 15 mev and 4 - 1.5 mev in cases of the inverted hierarchy ( ih ) and normal hierarchy ( nh ) mass spectra , respectively . since the @xmath3 half - lives expected for these regions are well above @xmath4 years , the 0@xmath1 rates are so low that large scale detectors have to be used .",
    "the amount of double - beta - decay ( dbd ) isotopes for such experiments are multi tons and multi 100 tons for ih and nh masses , also depending on the nuclear matrix element and the phase space volume .",
    "background rates , thus , have to be necessarily as low as an order of or less than 1 per year ( y ) per ton ( t ) in the region of interest ( roi ) at the @xmath5-value in the sum energy spectrum of the two @xmath6 rays . dbd studies and @xmath2 masses are discussed in recent reviews and their references @xcite .",
    "the solar-@xmath0s are omnipresent and can not be shielded , and thus their charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) interactions are potential background ( bg ) sources for high sensitivity dbd experiments @xcite and references therein . actually , it has been shown that solar-@xmath2 cc interactions with dbd isotopes like @xmath7mo , @xmath8cd and @xmath9nd can be used for real - time studies of the low - energy solar-@xmath0s @xcite .",

    "one discussed option is the usage of large liquid - scintillator detectors loaded with the dbd isotope of interest at the level of some 10@xmath12 of the scintillator mass itself or even larger .",
    "kamland - zen uses a k - ton liquid scintillator with multi-100 kg @xmath13xe @xcite , and sno+ plans to study @xmath14te by means of a 0.8 k ton liquid scintillation detector loaded with 0.3 % natural te ( @xmath15te ) @xcite .",
    "both consider upgrades in the amount of loaded dbb isotope and other new experiments might follow this idea .",
    "liquid scintillators have also been discussed for possible @xmath16 experiments with @xmath7mo for the moon experiment @xcite and @xmath9nd @xcite at the beginning of sno+ .",
    "the total volume of the detector amounts to k - ton , and larger detectors like juno with 20 k - tons are already in preparation and m - ton scales might be necessary for nh mass studies .",
    "given these sizes of detectors , bgs due to solar @xmath2 interactions with liquid scintillators have to be considered as well , as already 300 ton scintillation detectors like borexino operate as solar-@xmath0 experiments .",

    "the solar-@xmath2 interactions with dbd isotopes were shown to be serious for dbd experiments to search for the ih and nh mass regions , depending on the nuclear matrix element and the energy resolution of the detector at the @xmath5-value @xcite .",
    "the present paper aims to discuss contributions of the solar-@xmath0 interactions with atomic electrons and nuclei involved in large - scale liquid scintillators .",
    "this involves the dbd isotope and the scintillator material .",
    "actually the solar-@xmath0 bg may set an upper limit on the dbd detector sensitivity for the @xmath3 half - life to be measured and thus a lower limit of the sensitivity for the majorana neutrino mass to be detected .",
    "let us first evaluate event rates of the solar-@xmath2 interactions with atomic electrons and nuclei in liquid scintillators to compare them with 0@xmath1 rates of current @xmath16 experiments for the ih mass region .",

    "furthermore we assume a constant detector volume .",
    "the neutrino - electron scattering rate at the energy window @xmath33 of roi per year per ton ( yt ) of the dbd isotope is expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath26 is the electron yield in unit of 10@xmath35 per kev per year per electron in the liquid scintillator , and @xmath36 is the ratio of the number of electrons to that of nucleons in the scintillator , @xmath37 stands for the energy resolution and @xmath38 is the dbd @xmath5 value in units of mev .",

    "@xmath36=0.55 is chosen .",
    "the energy spectrum of the recoiling electrons is nearly flat as a function of the energy @xcite in the region of 2 - 3 mev .",
    "it is approximately given as @xmath46 with @xmath47 being the scattered electron energy in units of mev .",
    "thus the event rate is nearly independent of the dbd @xmath5 values , and the rate is given as @xmath48 where @xmath49 with @xmath50 being the ratio ( concentration ) of the dbd isotopes to the scintillator ones .",
    "@xmath51 is a kind of a bg efficiency for the liquid scintillator . as the resolution @xmath52 ( i.e. @xmath33 ) increases , @xmath51 and thus @xmath53 increase .",
    "as the concentration of the dbd isotopes decreases , the relative weight of the dbd isotopes decreases and @xmath51 and @xmath53 relative to the dbd isotope increases . in a typical case of @xmath52=5@xmath54 and @xmath55=1@xmath54 ,",
    "one gets @xmath56=5 and @xmath57 2 - 3 /yt at @xmath583 mev .",
    "next we consider the cc interaction on carbon nuclei in the scintillator .",
    "the cross section is given as @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath22 is the fermi weak coupling constant , @xmath60 is the cabibo angle , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the out - going electron momentum and the total energy in mev / c and mev , @xmath63 is the fermi - function and @xmath64 is the weak strength for the @xmath65 state in the intermediate nucleus b ( see fig.1 ) . the strength is written as @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the fermi and gt strengths , and @xmath69 = 1.267 is the axial vector coupling constant in unit of the vector one @xcite .",
    "the cc cross section can be rewritten as @xmath70 since @xmath71c with @xmath5 = -17.338 mev can not be excited by the solar-@xmath0 cc interaction , the cc interaction to be considered is the @xmath18b-@xmath2 cc interaction on @xmath72c with the natural abundance of 1.1@xmath54 .",
    "the interaction is predominantly the ground state ( @xmath73 ) transition with @xmath5 = -2.220 and log@xmath74 = 3.7 .",
    "we evaluate the bg rate @xmath75 at @xmath38=3 mev of current interest",
    ". then the cc interactions of the @xmath18b-@xmath0 with the energy around @xmath20=5.22 mev contributes to the bg in the roi at @xmath47=3 mev .",
    "using the cc cross section for @xmath47=3 mev and the @xmath18b-@xmath0 flux at 5.22 mev taking @xmath0 oscillations into account , the bg rate integrated over the energy window of @xmath76 is of the order of @xmath77/yt .",
    "this is much smaller than the bg rate of the @xmath0-e scattering ( eq.(3 ) ) .",
    "we now evaluate the 0@xmath1 signal rate to compare with the solar-@xmath2 bg rates . the 0@xmath1 rate per yt for the light majorana-@xmath2 exchange",

    "we note that @xmath79 includes conventionally the axial weak coupling @xmath83 with @xmath84 being the vector coupling constant .",

    "actually , the renormalization factor around @xmath92 is suggested in case of the pnqrpa model due to isobar and other nuclear medium effects @xcite ) .    for a typical case of @xmath93/y , @xmath80 = 20 mev/@xmath94 , @xmath95=100 , and @xmath81=0.6 , the 0@xmath1 signal rate is @xmath96 in the case of a typical @xmath97 2 - 3 ,",

    "the dbd signal rate with @xmath82=2 for the ih mass of 20 mev is nearly the same as the bg rate for a very ideal case of @xmath51=1 , for example this could be 5 @xmath54 energy resolution and 5@xmath54 dbd isotope concentration . in a more realistic case of @xmath51=5 , i.e. 7@xmath54 resolution and 1.4 @xmath54 concentration ,",
    "the bg rate is larger than the signal rate at @xmath80 = 20 mev , and thus it is hard to cover the ih mass region of 15 - 45 mev .",

    "accordingly , one needs a liquid scintillator with @xmath1051 to cover the ih mass region if @xmath82 is around or less than 2 , while the requirement is a bit relaxed to @xmath1052 if @xmath82 is as large as 3 .",
    "in order to discuss quantitatively the neutrino mass to be detected in dbd experiments , we introduce the neutrino mass sensitivity @xmath106 defined as the minimum majorana @xmath2-mass to be detected by the detector with 90 @xmath54 confidence level . the minimum mass in unit of mev is written as @xcite @xmath107 where @xmath108 with @xmath95 being the mass number , @xmath109 is the 0@xmath1 peak detection efficiency , as defined before , @xmath110 is the number of counts required to identify the 0@xmath1 peak with 90 @xmath54 confidence level , and @xmath21 is the exposure time in units of year . in case of ideal experiments with no bgs",

    "in order to achieve the same sensitivity as the enriched @xmath14te , one needs an order of magnitude more isotopes if the exposure time is fixed .",
    "solar neutrinos interactions with atomic electrons in liquid scintillation detectors used for dbd experiments are evaluated .",
    "they are summarized as follows .",
    "\\1 . the bg rate at roi(region of interest for the 0@xmath1 experiment )",
    "is given by @xmath128 /y t ( year ton ) , where @xmath51 is the ratio of the detector energy resolution and the concentration of the dbd isotopes in the scintillator .",
    "it is of the same order of magnitude as the 0@xmath1 signal rate for the ih @xmath2-mass .",
    "so they are serious bg sources for dbd experiments to study the ih @xmath0-mass region .    \\2 .",
    "solar-@xmath2 interactions are not avoidable , but their bg contributions are reduced by improving the resolution @xmath52 and/or increasing the concentration @xmath55 . in case of @xmath1292 , scintillation detectors with @xmath1301 may cover the ih mass of 15 - 45 mev by the exposure of @xmath13110 ty , but those with @xmath1305 require @xmath13150 ty . then detectors required to cover the nh mass region of @xmath132 = 1.5 - 4 mev would be 4 orders of magnitude larger in scale than those for the ih mass region , if @xmath51 would remain the same .",
    "it is important to use enriched isotopes , if possible , to increase the signal rate and to decrease the bg rate per ton of the dbd isotopes . in other words , experiments with only a few @xmath54 abundance of a dbd isotope",
    "suffer from large contributions of the solar-@xmath133 interactions with atomic electrons and nuclei in other isotopes .",
    "thus they should be enriched to more than 30 - 50% to cover even the ih @xmath0 mass . in case of @xmath134ca with the natural abundance of 0.2 @xmath54 , enrichment to around",
    "50 @xmath54 is crucial although the bg rate @xmath26 at @xmath5=4.3 is lower by 15@xmath54 than those for other isotopes with @xmath135 3 mev @xcite .",
    "so far we discussed mainly the bg rates from the liquid scintillator with a small concentration of @xmath1361 .",
    "if @xmath55 is increased to a couple of 10 @xmath54 in order to improve the mass sensitivity ( eq.10 ) , it may affect the resolution @xmath52 and increase the bg rate from dbd atomic electrons and nuclei , too . the density change in case of heavy",
    "loading may require modifications of the support system of the scintillation apparatus .",
    "for example in sno+ with low loading , ropes have to be fixed at the ground floor , while for massive loading they have to be fixed on the top as the density becomes higher than the surrounding water .",
    "similar issues might be occurring at other experiments as well . otherwise it could only be compensated by removing scintillator if the volume is fixed .",
    "furthermore it would be a big challenge to reduce the resolution to a few @xmath54 and to increase the concentration to an order of 10 @xmath54 simultaneously to realize the small bg efficiency of @xmath1371 as required to cover the full ih mass region .",
    "the scattered electron is a forward - peak distribution with respect to the incident solar-@xmath0 direction .",
    "as scintillation detectors also contain a weak contribution of cerenkov light which is directional sensitive and very fast it might be used , in principle , for rejecting the solar-@xmath0 events , but whether it can be done has to be shown .",
    "brief remarks on solar neutrino contributions to dbd experiments are given in this section .",
    "the bg contributions due to the solar-@xmath2 interactions with dbd nuclei should also be well considered in case of liquid scintillators with modest energy resolution of @xmath52 .",
    "if the bg events involve @xmath138,@xmath139 , and/or inverse @xmath6 rays as shown in fig.1 , they might be reduced by measuring their spacial correlations ( signal selection by spacial correlation sssc ) and/or their time correlations ( signal selection by time correlation sstc ) @xcite . if not , gamma rays from excited states will add to the background as well .",
    "it should be noted that the mass sensitivity does depend on @xmath82 .",
    "the sensitivities for @xmath140=2 as plotted in figs .",
    "4 and 5 are smaller or larger by a factor 1.3 if the matrix element gets larger or smaller by the same factor .",
    "in fact , @xmath82 is rather model dependent , and subjects to the uncertainties of the interaction parameters and the renormalization ( quenching ) of the weak coupling @xmath69 used in the model @xcite .",
    "+ in the present letter , we have discussed general features of the solar-@xmath0 bg contributions in liquid scintillator dbd experiments , and have evaluated them .",
    "the solar-@xmath0 es bgs were also discussed in a review @xcite . actually , they depend on the energy resolution @xmath52 ( which might change with loading due to changes in optical properties ) and the dbd isotope concentration @xmath55 , and also on the way to reduce the bgs by various hard - ware and analysis cuts . consequently , the effects of the solar-@xmath0 interactions depend largely on details of the individual detector specifications , the configurations and the data - analyses .",
    "so we do not discuss the actual rates of the solar-@xmath0 bgs for individual current and future detectors .",
    "finally , we remark that the solar-@xmath0 interactions might be potential bg sources for any large - scale experiments to search for low - energy rare events as dbd and dark matter @xcite , or in turn these detectors could be used for solar neutrino studies as well if @xmath16 and other bgs would be eliminated or separated well .",
