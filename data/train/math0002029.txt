    "is encoded by the complex geometry of @xmath3 , we ask ourselves what holomorphic object on @xmath3 corresponds to @xmath6 , the weyl tensor of the self - dual manifold @xmath1 .",
    "it seems that this question , although natural , has not been considered in the literature , and maybe a reason for that is that the answer appears to be a highly non - linear object .",
    "this object is more easily understood in the framework of complex - riemannian geometry ( see section [ s.w2 ] ) : following lebrun @xcite , we ( locally ) introduce the space @xmath7 of complex null - geodesics of * m * ( _ ambitwistor space _ ) . for a self - dual ( complex ) 4-manifold * m * , its ( local ) twistor space",

    "the twistor space @xmath3 completely describe the conformal structure of * m*. in particular , a null - geodesic @xmath8 in * m * corresponds to the set of rational curves in @xmath3 tangent to a 2-plane .",

    "integral @xmath9-cone _ of @xmath8 ( see section [ s.w3 ] ) , is lifted to a ( linearized ) @xmath9-cone in @xmath10 .",
    "our first result ( theorem [ t1 ] ) is that the weyl tensor of * m * is equivalent to the projective curvature ( see section [ s.w4 ] ) of the field of @xmath9-cones on @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , if such a cone is _ flat _ , then @xmath6 vanishes on certain isotropic planes in * m*.    we use theorem [ t1 ] to investigate global properties of a self - dual manifold * m * : if the integral @xmath9-cone of @xmath8 is part of a smooth surface in @xmath3 , then the linearized @xmath9-cone is flat ( theorems [ twist ] , [ 3 ] ) . in particular",

    "it appears then that the conformal structure does not extend smoothly to the compactification .    a good illustration of what happens in the non - flat ( self - dual ) case is the khler - einstein manifold @xmath13 whose twistor space is known to be the manifold of flags in @xmath14 @xcite , see section [ s.w8 ] .",
    "different methods allow us to generalize theorem 3 to non geodesically - connected self - dual manifolds : we show ( theorem [ compact ] ) that if a self - dual manifold admits a compact , simply - connected , null - geodesic , then it is conformally flat .",
    "we also note that the rational curves in @xmath3 , corresponding to the points of * m * ( see section [ s.w2 ] ) are then geodesics of some _ projective structure _ of @xmath3 iff the latter is projectively flat ( corollary [ twfl ] ) .",
    "the isotropic , totally geodesic surfaces ( called @xmath0-surfaces ) in a self - dual manifold * m * appear to have a projective structure , given by the null - geodesics of * m * contained in it ( section [ s.w6 ] ) .",

    "the conformal geometry in dimensions 3 and 4 are related , as any geodesically convex 3-manifold @xmath15 can be realized as the _ conformal infinity _ of a self - dual 4-manifold * m * @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath15 is umbilic in * m * , and we relate , in section [ s.w7 ] , the conformal invariants of the 2 manifolds : the cotton - york tensor of @xmath15 is identified to the derivative , in the normal direction , of the weyl tensor of * m * ( theorem [ umbilic ] ) .",
    "this result can be equally stated in the real framework .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ s.w2 ] we recall the classical results of the twistor theory ( especially for complex 4-manifolds ) , in section [ s.w3 ] we introduce the @xmath9-cones on the ( ambi-)twistor space , and , in section [ s.w4 ] , we prove the equivalence between the projective curvature of the latter and the weyl tensor @xmath6 of * m*. section [ s.w5 ] is devoted to the proof of some results of the type `` compactness implies conformal ( projective ) flatness '' : theorems [ twist ] , [ 3 ] and [ compact ] , mentioned above .",
    "we study the projective structure of @xmath0-surfaces in section [ s.w7 ] , and we illustrate the above results on the special case of the self - dual manifold @xmath13 , in section [ s.w8 ] .",

    "complex - riemannian geometry is obtained from riemannian geometry by replacing the field @xmath16 by @xmath17 ( e.g. a complex `` metric '' becomes a non - degenerate symmetric complex - bilinear form on the tangent space ) , and all classical results hold , naturally with the exception of those making use of partitions of unity .",

    "note that we do not need * m * to be compact in theorem [ compact ]  ; on the other hand , we assume it to be self - dual .",
    "we first remark that the main difficulty is the definition of @xmath7 , the space of null - geodesics , and of @xmath3 , the twistor space of @xmath97 , as * m * is not necessarily civilized .",
    "this is only possible on small open sets , but , in general , we can not expect to have any global construction of this kind .",
    "thus , things that were almost obvious in the twistorial framework ( like the existence of compact deformations of the null - geodesic @xmath8 ) , seem much more difficult to prove directly . the idea is to prove that all null - geodesics close to @xmath8 are diffeomorphic to @xmath132 .",
    "then , we show that , conversely , every projective line which is a deformation of @xmath8 as a compact curve is a null - geodesic . in particular , sections in the normal bundle @xmath175 are induced by ( local ) jacobi fields .",

    "moreover , this normal field is the unique solution , for the prescribed 1-jet in @xmath96 induced by @xmath432 , of a second order differential equation on @xmath175 :    the jacobi equations for null - geodesic induce a second order linear differential operator @xmath433 on @xmath175 , depending only on the conformal structure @xmath18 of * m*.    for a levi - civita connection @xmath361 of a local metric on * m * , we locally define the following differential operator on @xmath434 : @xmath435 by @xmath436 .",

    "we can easily imagine how to find such a refinement of the initial covering .",
    "the proof of the proposition now follows two ideas : first , we consider a very special covering by disks ( for the round metric @xmath453 ) of @xmath8 ; second , we define a neighborhood of @xmath451 in @xmath30 of isotropic directions for which , using the special covering of @xmath8 , we can extend the associated null - geodesics and eventually get compact ones .",
    "we call @xmath451 the canonical lift of a null - geodesic in @xmath30 ; it is an integral curve of the geodesic distribution of lines in @xmath30 .",
