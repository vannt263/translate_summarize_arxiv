    "systems of interacting particles driven far from equilibrium are of current interest in statistical physics @xcite",
    ". microscopic models of such systems often capture some aspects of vehicular traffic . in such `` particle - hopping '' models of vehicular traffic the particles represent vehicles and the nature of the interactions among these particles is determined by the manner in which the vehicles influence the motion of each other @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of these models are often formulated in terms of   `` update rules '' using the language of cellular automata ( ca ) @xcite .",
    "for example , the nagel - schreckenberg ( nasch ) model @xcite is the most popular minimal ca model of vehicular traffic on highways while , to our knowledge , the first ca model of city traffic was developed by biham , middleton and levin @xcite .",
    "the results obtained for these models , using the techniques of statistical mechanics , are not only of fundamental intetest for understanding truly nonequilibrium phenomena but may also find practical use in traffic science and engineering . @xcite . among such results",
    "are the time - headway and distance - headway distributions .",
    "the _ time - headway_(*th * ) is defined as the time interval between the departures ( or arrivals ) of two successive vehicles recorded by a detector placed at a fixed position on the route while the distance between the successive vehicles can be defined as the corresponding distance - headway ( * dh * ) .",
    "the distributions of th and dh not only contain detailed informations on the nature of the spatio - temporal organization of the vehicles but are also of practical interest to traffic engineers because larger headways provide greater margins of safety whereas higher capacities of the highway require smaller headways .    in a @xmath2 paper , oloan et al @xcite",
    "have developed a one- dimensional lattice model of bus - route where the buses are represented by particles which move from one site to the next ; each site of this model represents a bus stop along the route .",
    "the motion of the buses in this bus route model with random sequential updating ( brmrsu ) is strongly influenced by the passengers waiting at the bus stops .",
    "the brmrsu model may be viewed as a generalization of a simple particle - hopping model , namely , the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) by coupling the dynamics of the particles to another new variable which represents the presence ( or absence ) of passengers waiting at the bus stops . the bus route model in @xcite does not deal with overcrowded buses ; it implicitly assumes that either the buses have infinite capacity or that the passenger arrival rate is slow enough to avoid overcrowding .",
    "the brmrsu exhibits a bose - einstein - condensation - like phenomenon which has been observed earlier in the tasep and in the nasch model when quenched random hopping rates are associated with the particles @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the stable bose - einstein - condensed states observed at sufficiently low densities in the tasep ( and in the nasch model ) with random hopping rates , those in the brmrsu are metastable .",
    "the main characteristic of the spatially - inhomogeneous bose - einstein - condensed state is the existence of a macroscopically long gap in front of a cluster of vehicles led by the slowest one .",
    "in finite systems , for small @xmath3 ( @xmath3 is the rate of passenger arrival at a bus stop ) , the bus clusters ( or , equivalently , the gaps between clusters ) in the brmrsu exhibit interesting coarsening phenomena as the system evolves from a random initial state .",
    "oloan et al .",
    "@xcite find that , after sufficiently long time , the typical size of the large gaps in the system grows with time @xmath4 according to a power growth law @xmath5 .",
    "in this paper we use a brm with _",
    "parallel updating _",
    "( * brmpu * ) which is obtained from the brmrsu @xcite by replacing the random sequential updating rule with parallel updating , with the aim of relating it with the nasch model where updating is done in parallel .",
    "we also propose here two extensions of the nasch model ( from now onwards referred to as the models * y * and * z * ) by replacing the constant hopping rates with two different time-/space - dependent hopping rates which we shall specify explicitly in section ii . we have computed the th distributions in the steady - states of the brmpu as well as in the models y and z through computer simulations .",
    "comparison of these distributions are shown in section iii .",
    "such comparisons elucidate the connection between the brmpu and the nasch model .",
    "then , approximating the brmpu as a generalization of the nasch model with a _ time - dependent hopping rate _ for the buses , we calculate in section iv the th distribution in the brmpu from the corresponding analytical expression in the nasch model .",
    "we compare the th distributions thus derived from analytical considerations with the corresponding results of computer simulations of the brmpu .",
    "these comparisions do not merely point out the regimes of validity of our analytical results but also indicate the differences arising from the different natures of the low - density steady - states in the brmpu and the nasch model .",
    "finally , we investigate in section v , interesting kinetic phenomena at low densities of the brmpu by computing the appropriate correlation functions ( to be defined in section v ) .",
    "we extract the universal laws governing the growth of the clusters of buses in finite samples of brmpu at low densities where the system approaches a bose - einstein - like `` condensed '' state evolving from random initial states .",
    "let us first summarize how the totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) @xcite , the nasch model @xcite and the bus route models @xcite are defined .      in the `` particle - hopping '' models of traffic",
    "the position , speed , acceleration as well as time are treated as _",
    "discrete _ variables . in this approach , a lane",
    "is represented by a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "each lattice site represents a `` cell '' which can be either empty or occupied by at most one `` vehicle '' at a given instant of time . at each _ discrete time _",
    "step @xmath6 , the state of the system is updated following a well defined prescription . in the tasep",
    "a randomly chosen particle can move forward , by one lattice spacing , with probability @xmath7 if the lattice site immediately in front of it is empty . in the nasch model , the speed @xmath8 of each vehicle can take one of the @xmath9 allowed _ integer _",
    "values @xmath10 .",
    "if the random - sequential updating scheme of the tasep is replaced by parallel updating then it becomes identical to the nasch model with @xmath11 and random braking probability @xmath12 .",
    "our interest in the nasch model is to unravel its connections to the brm . for this purpose",
    ", we only need the nasch model only with @xmath11 . _",
    "thus in what follows , by the nasch model , we shall mean nasch model with @xmath11 , unless explicitly stated otherwise_.      in the brm @xcite each of the lattice sites represents a bus stop and these stops are labeled by an index @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) @xcite . in each step of updating",
    ", each bus attempts to hop from one stop to the next",
    ". note that in the tasep and the nasch model one can label the lattice sites by the index @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) and describe the state of each of the sites by associating a variable @xmath15 with it ; @xmath16 if the site @xmath13 is occupied and @xmath17 if the site @xmath13 is empty .",
    "in contrast , in the brm , two binary variables @xmath15 and @xmath18 are assigned to each site @xmath13 : ( i ) if the site @xmath13 is occupied by a bus then @xmath16 ; otherwise @xmath17 .",
    "( ii ) if site @xmath13 has passengers waiting for a bus then @xmath19 ; otherwise @xmath20 .",
    "a site can not have both @xmath16 and @xmath19 simultaneously since a site can not have simultaneously a bus and waiting passengers .",
    "the state of the system is updated according to the following _ random sequential _ update rules : a site @xmath13 is picked up _ at random_. then , ( i ) if @xmath17 and @xmath20 ( i.e , site @xmath13 contains neither a bus nor waiting passengers ) , then @xmath21 with probability @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is the probability per unit time of the arrival ( @xmath22 the arrival rate ) of the first passenger at the empty bus stop .",
    "( arrival of the subsequent passengers does not affect the time evolution . )",
    "( ii ) if @xmath16 ( i.e. , there is a bus at the site @xmath13 ) and @xmath23 , then the hopping rate @xmath24 of the bus from site @xmath13 to @xmath25 is defined as follows : ( a ) if @xmath26 , then @xmath27 but ( b ) if @xmath28 , then @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the hopping rate of a bus onto a stop which has no waiting passengers and @xmath31 is the hopping rate onto a stop with waiting passenger(s ) . generally , @xmath32 , which reflects the fact that a bus has to slow down when it has to pick up passengers . in the brmrsu",
    "one can set @xmath33 without loss of generality .",
    "however , for reasons which will become clear soon , we shall keep @xmath34 .",
    "when a bus hops onto a stop @xmath13 with waiting passengers , @xmath18 is reset to zero as the bus takes all the passengers .",
    "note that the density of buses @xmath35 is a _ conserved _",
    "quantity whereas that of the passengers is not .    in the brmpu",
    "the random sequential update rules of the brmrsu are replaced by _",
    "parallel updating _ but all the other aspects of the updating remain unchanged .",
    "brmpu is related to the nasch model in two extreme limits of @xmath3 : in the unphysical limit of @xmath36 ( which means the passengers never arrive at a busstop ) , the brmpu reduces to the nasch model with @xmath11 and @xmath37 . in the opposite limit of maximum value of @xmath3 in brmpu , @xmath38 ( very fast rate of passenger arrival at a busstop ) ,",
    "the brmpu is equivalent to the nasch model with @xmath11 and @xmath39 .",
    "note that since the time between two updating steps is the unit of time , all values of @xmath40 are synonymous with @xmath38 .",
    "this is because any value of @xmath40 will bring at least one passenger to an empty bus stop between two updating times .",
    "interesting results in the model occur only for values of @xmath41 .",
    "note that if we take @xmath33 , then the limit @xmath36 would correspond to the limit @xmath42 ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) of the nasch model which is a deterministic ca and does not exhibit jammed states @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in exploring the connection between the brmpu and the nasch model with arbitrary @xmath7 throughout this paper we consider @xmath44 .",
    "it has been realized over the last few years that different modifications of the braking rule in the nasch model can lead to different types of phenomena which are interesting from the perspective of statistical physics .",
    "for example , such modifications can lead to self - organized criticality @xcite as well as metastability and phase segregation @xcite .",
    "klauck and schadschneider @xcite considered a model where the particle is allowed to hop forward by one site or by two sites with two different hopping rates .",
    "it has also been established that assigning quenched random hopping rates can lead to the formation of clusters of vehicles @xcite .    in a similar vein",
    ", we now extend the nasch model by replacing its constant ( time - independent ) hopping rate @xmath7 by two other alternatives which are intended to mimic the situations in the brmpu .    in one of these two alternatives",
    "( from now onwards referred to as model y ) the hopping rate of a vehicle at a given site @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a constant and @xmath48 is the time interval that has elapsed since the leading vehicle ( * lv * ) left the site @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath48 is therefore the time interval between the departure of lv and the arrival of the following vehicle ( * fv * ) at the site @xmath49 .    in the other extended nasch model ( from now onwards referred to as model z ) the hopping rate of the @xmath50-th vehicle depends on its instantaneous dh @xmath51 : @xmath52 where @xmath31 ( @xmath53 ) is a constant . at first sight",
    "it may seem more appropriate to have @xmath8 , rather than @xmath31 , in the exponential in equation ( [ eq - appqx ] ) .",
    "however , in section iii and fig.3(b ) , we show that the extended nasch model with the hopping rates of the form ( [ eq - appqx ] ) is a good approximation of the brmpu in a wide range of circumstances .",
    "both the models y and z reduce to the nasch model with constant hopping rates @xmath30 in the limit @xmath54 , and reduce to the nasch model with a constant hopping rate @xmath31 in the limit @xmath55 .",
    "models y and z are devised to capture the essential features of a bus - route model where the time- /space-",
    "dependent hopping rates of the vehicles depend on the presence or absence of waiting passengers .      for the numerical calculations of the various quantities through computer simulations",
    ", we let the system evolve from a random initial state following the appropriate updating rules mentioned above .",
    "we compute the quantities relevant for the investigation of the kinetics of the system during the time - evolution of the system towards its steady - state .",
    "after the system reaches steady - state , we compute its steady - state properties , e.g , the th distribution , by letting it evolve for the next @xmath56 time steps to obtain the required data .",
    "we then repeat the calculation with a different random initial state and , finally , average the data over @xmath57 different random initial states of the system .",
    "the largest systems we have simulated have a total length @xmath58 ; each sample of these was allowed to evolve upto a maximum of @xmath59 time steps which is not long enough to reach the corresponding steady - state but were used for the study of the kinetics . for the computation of the average steady - state properties",
    "we have used smaller systems ( typically @xmath60 ) which require shorter time to reach steady - state . in all our simulations",
    "we have used a periodic boundary condition .",
    "in fig.[thbrmpu ] we plot the th distributions in the models y and z for @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 at two different densities , namely , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "note that in the special case @xmath54 , both the models y and z as well as the brmpu reduce to the nasch model with @xmath66 . the data in fig.[thbrmpu ]",
    "establish that , when @xmath67 is sufficiently small ( e.g. , @xmath61 ) , the results of the models y and z agree well with those of the brmpu at all densities for identical values of the set of parameters .    in order to emphasize the effects of time-/space - dependence of the hopping rates on the th distribution we plot in fig .",
    "[ thns ] the exact th distributions in the nasch model with @xmath68 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 at the same two densities as used in fig.[thbrmpu ] .",
    "the observation that the th distribution in the nasch model for @xmath71 is narrow can be explained by fact that small noise ( @xmath72 ) gives rise to only a small width of the @xmath73-function - like th distribution , centered at @xmath74 , that one would observe at @xmath65 in the deterministic limit @xmath75 of the nasch model .",
    "comparing fig.[thns ] with the fig.[thbrmpu ] we find that , except for @xmath76 , the th distributions in the nasch model have much longer tail than those in the brmpu as well as in the model y and model z for the parameters @xmath77 .",
    "thus , the brmpu is well approximated by both the models y and z at @xmath67 as small as @xmath78 .",
    "however , we find a larger difference between the th distributions in the models y and z at larger values of @xmath67 ( see fig.([thyzvsns]a ) ) . for @xmath40",
    "the brmpu reduces to the nasch model with @xmath79 and the corresponding th distribution is in excellent agreement with that in the model z but differs significantly from that in the model y ( see fig.([thyzvsns]b ) ) .",
    "the results in figures 1,2 and 3 show that in a certain density regime , the brmpu is well approximated by the nasch model with time-/space - dependent hopping rates .",
    "we expect the passenger arrival rate @xmath3 of the brmpu and the hopping rate @xmath67 in models y and z to be related .",
    "we assume that the two are equal , even though we continue to use the two different symbols in order to allow the possibility of a difference between them in future simulations .",
    "for analytical calculation of the th distributions we label the site ( i.e. , the bus stop ) where the detector is located by @xmath80 , the stop immediately in front of it by @xmath81 , and so on .",
    "the detector clock resets to @xmath82 everytime a bus leaves the detector site .",
    "we begin our analytical calculations by writing @xmath83 , the probability of a th @xmath84 between the lv and the fv of a pair , as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the probability that there is a time interval @xmath87 between the departure of the lv and the arrival of the fv at the detector site and @xmath88 is the conditional probability given that the fv arrives at the detector site @xmath87 time steps after the departure of the lv , it halts for @xmath89 time steps at that site .    encouraged by the success of the models y and z in capturing the th distributions over moderate and high density regimes , we now approximate the brmpu as an extended nasch model with a time - dependent hopping rate which is closely related to ( but slightly different from ) those in the models y and z. thus for our analytical calculation of @xmath83 in the brmpu , we approximately treat it as an extended nasch model ( with @xmath68 ) where the hopping rate @xmath7 , instead of being a constant , is a time - dependent quantity given by the expression @xmath90 this form can be compared to those given in equations ( [ eq - appqt ] ) and ( [ eq - appqx ] ) .",
    "the exact analytical expression for @xmath86 in the nasch model ( with @xmath68 ) has been derived earlier @xcite using a 2-cluster approximation @xcite which goes beyond the simple mean field approximation .",

    "the expressions for the various @xmath92s are given by @xcite @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 where @xmath97 @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "on the other hand , in the simple mean field approximation , the 2-cluster probabilities reduce to @xmath100 and @xmath101 and , hence , @xmath102^{t_1 - 1 }   \\label{eq - mfpt1}\\ ] ] we shall calculate the th distribution , @xmath83 , given in ( [ eq - pth ] ) , using the expression ( [ eq - clpt1 ] ) ( together with ( [ eq - c2 ] ) , ( [ eq - c4 ] ) and ( [ eq - y ] ) ) and then compare with the corresponding th distribution obtained by using ( [ eq - mfpt1 ] ) , instead of ( [ eq - clpt1 ] ) , to emphasize the importance of correlations .    in order to obtain @xmath83 , let us next calculate @xmath103 . again , following the arguments used earlier @xcite in the calculation of the th distribution in the nasch model , we get @xmath104}{\\bar{g}-p }   \\label{eq - q}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the probability that a vehicle moves in the next time step ( i.e. , in the @xmath106 time step ) and @xmath107 . in the 2-cluster approximation @xmath108",
    "which , in the simple mean field approximation reduces to @xmath109    substituting ( [ eq - clpt1 ] ) and ( [ eq - q ] ) into ( [ eq - pth ] ) and using ( [ eq - clg ] ) for @xmath105 and ( [ eq - appqt1 ] ) for @xmath7 ( together with ( [ eq - c1])-([eq - c4 ] ) for the configurational probabilities and ( [ eq - y ] ) ) , we get @xmath83 in the 2-cluster approximation by carrying out the summation over @xmath87 in ( [ eq - pth ] ) numerically",
    ". we shall refer to this result as the 2-cluster estimate of the th distribution .",
    "similarly , substituting ( [ eq - mfpt1 ] ) and ( [ eq - q ] ) into ( [ eq - pth ] ) and using ( [ eq - mfg ] ) for @xmath105 and ( [ eq - appqt1 ] ) for @xmath7 ( together with ( [ eq - c1])-([eq - c4 ] ) and ( [ eq - y ] ) ) we get the simple mean field estimate of @xmath83 by again summing over @xmath87 numerically . note that in both cases , @xmath83 , in addition to its @xmath84 dependence , depends on parameters @xmath110    in fig.[cvecv ] we show these analytic results for three different values of @xmath67 and two different values of densities @xmath111 . at sufficiently low density of buses , there is hardly any difference between the 2-cluster estimate and the simple mean field estimate of the th distribution ( see fig.[cvecv](a ) ) .",
    "however , with the increase of the density of the buses , the difference between these two estimates increases ( see fig.[cvecv](b ) ) .    as noted earlier , the th distribution in the brmpu changes continuously with the variation of @xmath3 ; the results for @xmath36 and @xmath112 are identical to those in the nasch model with @xmath66 and @xmath79 , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ ana ] we compare the 2-cluster analytic estimate of the th distribution in the brmpu ( approximated as the extended nasch model ) for three different values of @xmath67 , namely , @xmath113 , with the corresponding numerical data we have obtained from direct computer simulations of the brmpu model . figure [ ana ] ( a ) shows the comparison for the higher density value @xmath114 .",
    "we note very good agreement between the 2-cluster estimates and the computer simulation data .",
    "similar comparison at a lower density @xmath115 is shown in fig .",
    "[ ana ] ( b ) .",
    "the poor agreement between the 2-cluster estimate and simulation data for the th distribution in the brmpu at low densities is a consequence of the fact that at low densities , the vehicles in a finite system form a cluster in the steady - state where there is at most one or two empty sites in between each pair of vehicles .",
    "it is well known that the 2-cluster approximation scheme is not good enough for such states where correlation extends over distances which are much longer than what can be captured by a 2-cluster approximation . on the other hand , at higher densities there is no clustering of the buses in the steady - state of the brmpu and the physics of the system is very similar to that in the steady - states of the nasch model .",
    "this is because most of the buses stop on account of another bus at the next site , rather than due to waiting passengers .",
    "nevertheless , since the states with clusters of buses are metastable in infinitely long samples of brmpu , the 2-cluster approximation is expected to yield good estimates for the stable steady - states of the brmpu even at low densities . however , since it is extremely difficult ( requires very long simulation time ) to achieve these stable steady - states in any computer simulation at small @xmath3 we have not been able to demonstrate this explicitly .",
    "in traffic models like brmpu , the kinetics are governed by two coupled fields , local passenger density @xmath116 and local bus density @xmath117 . in this paper a binary approximation ( zero or nonzero ) to the @xmath116 field is made .",
    "@xmath117 is globally conserved and @xmath116 is a nonconserved field .",
    "it is not clear whether the kinetics seen in our simulations of brmpu and models y and z are derivable from a free energy functional .",
    "we are currently inquiring into such a possibility .",
    "if this turns out to be the case , then the model of kinetics appropriate to our simulations is model c @xcite in the halperin- hohenberg classification scheme of critical dynamics .",

    "@xmath121 vanishes in the absence of any correlation in the occupation of the sites by the buses .",
    "also at any time @xmath4 , @xmath122 this correlation function has been calculated earlier for the nasch model analytically for @xmath68 @xcite and numerically for higher values of @xmath123 .",
    "however , the nature of this correlation function in the brmpu is expected to differ qualitatively , particularly at low densities , from that in the nasch model because of the formation of clusters in the steady - state of the brmpu .",
    "we compute @xmath121 during the time - evolution of the system from random initial states .",
    "our simulations for the time evolution are done only for one set of parameters : @xmath124 and @xmath125 in fig.[cffig ] we plot the _ normalized _ correlation function @xmath126 as a function of @xmath127 for values of @xmath4 upto @xmath128 .",
    "the value @xmath129 corresponding to the first zero - crossing of @xmath130 is taken as a measure of the typical size of the clusters of buses at time @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath131 increases with @xmath4 indicates the coarsening of these clusters .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that in systems with conserved order parameters ( the so - called model b , of which the binary alloy is a physical realization ) the coarsening follows the lifshitz - slyozov law @xmath132 . in the case of the brmpu",
    ", @xmath133 may appear to follow the same lifshitz - slyozov law if the data upto @xmath134 are shown on a log - log plot ( see fig.[loglogr ] ) .",
    "however , the upward turn of the data beyond @xmath134 in fig.[loglogr ] indicates more subtle features of this growth .",
    "in fact , fitting the raw data @xmath133 to the curve @xmath135 we have estimated the parameters @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "we found that @xmath138 and @xmath139 . if the growth of @xmath133 , indeed , follows the law ( [ thalflaw ] )",
    "then the @xmath5 growth law is expected to become clearly visible directly in fig.[loglogr ] for times long enough to satisfy the condition @xmath140 , i.e. , for @xmath141 .",
    "this argument , together with our estimate @xmath138 , explains why the true growth law ( [ thalflaw ] ) can be anticipated in fig.[loglogr ] only beyond @xmath134 .",
    "in fact , plotting @xmath133 against @xmath5 and comparing with @xmath142 in fig.[rvsthalf ] we do , indeed , see clear evidence of the @xmath5 growth for @xmath141 .",
    "finally , in fig.[scaling ] we plot the normalized correlation function @xmath143 against the scaled variable @xmath144 . since the data for @xmath4 as widely separated as @xmath145 to @xmath146 superpose , the validity of dynamic scaling @xcite is convincing for kinetics of the brmpu model . the @xmath5 growth in our brmpu model that is akin to model c",
    "@xcite implies that it is the nonconserved passenger density field @xmath147 that is driving the kinetics , for the parameter set that we have simulated .",
    "the models and simulations presented in this paper were inspired by the work on brmrsu in ref .",
    "the model in @xcite uses random sequential updating ( rsu ) , whereas our complimentary study is based on parallel updating ( pu ) . as expected , the properties of the steady states including the dependence of average velocity and current on the particle density are similar ( not explicitly displayed in figures ) .",
    "we have in addition computed and analytically obtained ( in the @xmath74-cluster approximation ) the time headway ( th ) distributions for a wide range of parameters . at moderate and high densities ,",
    "the simulation and analytic results agree well ; but the comparison fails at low densities .",
    "we have also studied kinetics of the brmpu which is also complimentary to that done for the brmrsu in ref .",
    "we find the bus clusters to grow in size as @xmath5 .",
    "this shows that the growth exponent is robust with respect to the updating schemes .",
    "we have also computed the equal time pair correlation function of the local bus density , and find that it obeys a dynamical scaling ansatz : @xmath148 , where @xmath133 is the bus cluster size .",
    "we have also found connection between the models of brmpu type and the nasch model .",
    "the nasch model is the minimal ca model of vehicular traffic on idealized single - lane highways .",
    "this model has been extended @xcite in various ways to incorporate some aspects of real traffic which are not captured by the minimal model .",
    "all the bus route models which we have considered in this paper , namely , the brmpu , model y and model z , may be regarded as extensions of the nasch model with @xmath68 . in each of these models the dynamics of the vehicles are coupled to another non - conserved field , namely , the passenger density field @xmath147 , resulting in space- and time - dependent hopping rates of the vehicles . however , there is a difference in the length and time scales in the bus route models and in the nasch model . in the nasch model",
    "the motion of the vehicles from one cell to the next is described on a time scale which is roughly the reaction time of each driver .",
    "in contrast , the lattice constant in the brm is of the order of the distance between successive stops on the bus route .",
    "thus , each time step corresponds to a much longer real time than that in the nasch model . in other words , the interactions of the buses with the traffic , on its way from one",

    "<S> a bus route model ( brm ) can be defined on a one - dimensional lattice , where buses are represented by `` particles '' that are driven forward from one site to the next with each site representing a bus stop . </S>",
    "<S> we replace the random sequential updating rules in an earlier brm by parallel updating rules . in order to elucidate the connection between the brm with parallel updating ( brmpu ) and the nagel - schreckenberg ( nasch ) model , we propose two alternative extensions of the nasch model with space-/time - dependent hopping rates . approximating the brmpu as a generalization of the nasch model , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate analytically the steady - state distribution of the _ time headways _ ( th ) which are defined as the time intervals between the departures ( or arrivals ) of two successive particles ( i.e. , buses ) recorded by a detector placed at a fixed site ( i.e. , bus stop ) on the model route . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these th distributions with the corresponding results of our computer simulations of the brmpu , as well as with the data from the simulation of the two extended nasch models . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate interesting kinetic properties exhibited by the brmpu during its time evolution from random initial states towards its steady - states .    </S>",
