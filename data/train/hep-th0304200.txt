    ". however , one can not stabilize the vev of the dilaton field to a fine value in the model with a superpotential generated by a single gaugino condensation and the tree - level khler potential .",
    "one of the simple extensions is the model with double gaugino condensations and the tree - level khler potential , i.e. the so - called racetrack model @xcite-@xcite , while non - perturbative khler potential has also been considered @xcite .",
    "in fact , one can stabilize the vev of the dilaton field to a finite value depending on beta function coefficients of gauge couplings relevant to gaugino condensations .",

    "i models , twisted moduli fields are gauge singlets , while they are charged in heterotic models .",
    "gauge kinetic functions depend on twisted moduli in type i models @xcite .",
    "they play a role in 4d green - schwarz anomaly cancellation e.g. for anomalous @xmath0@xcite , while the dilaton field plays the same role in heterotic models @xcite .",

    "the prediction of the gauge couplings depends on the vev of twisted moduli fields .",
    "the mirage unification of gauge couplings is one possibility to explain the experimental values of gauge couplings with lower string scale @xcite .",

    ", we will consider the model with dilaton and twisted moduli fields , which is inspired by type i string models , and study stabilization of dilaton and twisted moduli fields .",
    "for similar purpose , models with twisted moduli fields have been studied in refs .",
    "the khler potential of the twisted moduli fields is not clear . here",
    "we will use the assumption of the canonical form , which has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and show this form is important to stabilize the vev of twisted moduli . as another example , we will assume the logarithmic form of the khler potential for the twisted moduli fields like the dilaton and other moduli fields .",

    "however , we will show that even in the case with the logarithmic khler potential the positive exponent in the non - perturbative superpotential is useful for the stabilization of the twisted moduli fields .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review shortly the stabilization to the dilaton vev in the racetrack model . in section 3 , we study the model with dilaton and twisted moduli fields . in section 3.1",
    "we shortly review about the twisted moduli fields . in section 3.2",
    "we consider the single gaugino condensation model and show how different the stabilization of twisted moduli fields is from the dilaton stabilization . in section 3.3",
    "we consider a specific double gaugino condensation model in order to study the simultaneous stabilization of the dilaton and twisted moduli fields . in section 3.4",
    "we give a comment about effects of twisted moduli fields on the dilaton vev .",
    "seciton 4 is devoted to conclusion and discussions .",
    "the tree - level khler potential of the dilaton field is obtained as @xmath1 the gauge kinetic function of heterotic models is obtained as @xmath2 up to kac - moody level , and the gauge coupling @xmath3 is obtained as @xmath4 .",
    "this is the same for the gauge multiplets originated from @xmath5 branes in type i models .",
    "perturbatively , the dilaton field has a flat potential .",
    "the single gaugino condensation induces the non - perturbative superpotential , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a constant , @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the one - loop beta function coefficient , e.g. @xmath10 for pure n=1 @xmath11 yang - milles theory . with the above khler potential ,",
    "the scalar potential @xmath12 is written as @xmath13 , \\label{scalar - v}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 denotes the first derivative of @xmath15 by @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath17 .",
    "here we have not taken into account @xmath18-terms , although @xmath16 has a @xmath18-term potential in heterotic models if the model has anomalous @xmath0 .",
    "is relevant to green - schwarz anomaly cancellation . ]",
    "we have the following solutions of @xmath19 : @xmath20 or @xmath21    with the single gaugino condensation superpotential ( [ superw-1 ] ) , the solution ( [ sol-1 ] ) leads to @xmath22 , which is not a realistic vev for @xmath16 in the asymptotically free case . the solution ( [ sol-2 ] )",
    "leads to @xmath23 , but this corresponds to the maximum point of @xmath12 .",
    "see fig .  1 , where the lower line shows the scalar potential against @xmath24 in the case with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    in heterotic models ,",
    "the requirement of @xmath27 duality invariance of the overall moduli field @xmath28 leads to the following superpotential @xcite , @xmath29 the corresponding scalar potential is written as @xmath30,\\ ] ] with @xmath31 here we have used the khler potential of @xmath28 as @xmath32 however , the inclusion of @xmath33 does not help the stabilization of @xmath16 . if @xmath34 , the situation is the same as the case without @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath35 , the scalar potential monotonically decreases as @xmath36 . the upper line in fig .",
    "1 shows @xmath37 for @xmath38 , @xmath26 and @xmath39 .",
    "= 0.7    one mechanism to stabilize the vev of @xmath16 is to consider the superpotential with double gaugino condensations , @xmath40 with this superpotential , the solution ( [ sol-1 ] ) of @xmath41 is given as @xmath42 if @xmath43 , the latter equation becomes the simple equation , @xmath44 in the case with @xmath45 , the stabilized value of @xmath46 is determined by @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the natural order of @xmath16 is of @xmath48",
    ". if @xmath49 and @xmath50 are close each other , the vev of @xmath16 is enhanced .",
    "for example , one can obtain @xmath51 of @xmath16 in two case ; i ) the case with large beta - function coefficients @xmath52 and ii ) the case with fine - tuning values ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "for the latter case , we have @xmath54 e.g. for @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "twisted moduli fields @xmath57 are localized at orbifold fixed points and these moduli fields are important from several phenomenological view points in 4d models obtained from type i and type ii orientifold models .",
    "for example , the gauge kinetic functions corresponding to gauge groups originated from @xmath5 branes are written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a model - dependent constant @xcite .",
    "concerned about @xmath59 , here we take purely phenomenological standpoint , that is , we treat @xmath59 as free parameters .",
    "similarly , for the gauge groups originated from e.g. @xmath60-branes , which are wrapped on the @xmath61-th torus ( @xmath62 ) , the corresponding gauge kinetic functions are written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the moduli field corresponding to the @xmath61-th torus and its khler potential is obtained @xmath65 that is , its form is exactly the same as the khler potential of the dilaton field ( [ kahler - s ] ) .",
    "thus , we can discuss the stabilization of @xmath64 due to gaugino condensation from @xmath60-originated gauge groups in the same way as the stabilization of @xmath16 due to condensation from @xmath5 gaugino fields . here , we concentrate ourselves on the @xmath16 stabilization .",
    "one of important aspects is that the twisted moduli field @xmath57 plays a role in 4d green - schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism .",
    "for example , under anomalous @xmath0 symmetry , the twisted moduli fields are assumed to transform at one - loop level @xmath66 with the transformation parameter @xmath67 .",
    "the fayet - iliopoulos term is written by the first derivative of khler potential @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the khler potential of the twisted moduli field .",
    "thus , the magnitude of the fayet - iliopoulos term is determined by the vev of @xmath57 .",
    "unfortunately , the khler potential of @xmath57 , @xmath69 , is still unclear . in the limit @xmath70",
    ", the khler metric has no singularity .",
    "hence , the khler potential @xmath69 could be expanded as @xmath71 actually , this form has been studied in ref .",
    "thus , we use the assumption of the khler potential as @xmath72 in a half part of our analyses .",
    "however , since its reliability for @xmath73 may be unclear , we assume @xmath74 as a trial form of the khler potential for @xmath75 .    we also give comments on the gauge coupling unification .",
    "within the framework of minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , three gauge couplings of @xmath76 meet around @xmath77 gev .",
    "suppose that the three gauge groups are originated from different sets of @xmath5-branes .",
    "if one can stabilize @xmath78 , the gauge couplings are universal at the string scale @xmath79 .",
    "that implies @xmath80 . otherwise , if @xmath81 is sizable , the gauge couplings are , in general , non - universal at @xmath79 .",
    "however , one of interesting possibilities to explain the experimental values of gauge couplings is the so - called `` mirage unification '' @xcite .",
    "the mssm gauge coupling at @xmath82 is obtained as @xmath83 where @xmath84 are the one - loop beta - function coefficient for the mssm .",
    "let us consider a specific model that the constants @xmath85 are proportional to @xmath84 . in this scenario ,",
    "the gauge couplings are non - universal at @xmath79 , but its prediction is the same as the universal gauge coupling around @xmath86 .",
    "the string scale @xmath79 can be low depending on @xmath87 .",
    "note that even a small value of @xmath88 like @xmath89 is important .",
    "if the ratio of @xmath79 to @xmath86 satisfies @xmath90 that leads to the mssm gauge couplings consistent with the experimental values .",
    "thus , it is important to study the stabilization of the twisted moduli field @xmath57 .",
    "that is the issue we will study in the flowing sections .",
    "we will also discuss how the twisted moduli field @xmath57 affects on the stabilization of the dilaton field @xmath16 .      here",
    "we study the case with single gaugino condensation , although one can not stabilize the dilaton field with the single gaugino condensation as seen section 2 .",
    "that will be useful for later discussions .",
    "the khler potential is written as @xmath91 and the superpotential due to the gaugino condensation is obtained as @xmath92 using the khler potential and the superpotential , we can write the scalar potential as @xmath93 ,   \\label{scalar - v - m}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 denotes the inverse of the khler metric for @xmath57 and @xmath95 . again , we do not take into account @xmath18-terms .",

    "similar analyses can be done for the polynomial khler potential .",
    "however , it is not clear that the expansion of the khler potential @xmath119 is reliable for @xmath120",
    ". thus , in the next subsection we will perform the same analysis by assuming @xmath121 as a trial .",

    "this situation is the same as the problem of the dilaton stabilization by the single gaugino condensation as seen in section 2 .",

    "assuming the khler potential @xmath149 and @xmath142 , we have shown that the vev of @xmath88 can be stabilized with the vev of @xmath16 fixed .",
