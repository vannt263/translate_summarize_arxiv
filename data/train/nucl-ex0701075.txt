    "@xmath1 suppression induced by debye screening of the static potential between @xmath2 pairs was originally hailed as an unambiguous signature of the qgp  @xcite . this simple picture , however , is complicated by competing effects that either reduce the yield , such as comover absorption  @xcite , or enhance it , such as recombination models  @xcite . with the low cross section of the @xmath3 family ,",
    "the roles of absorption and recombination are negligible .",
    "lattice qcd studies of quarkonia spectral functions indicate that while the @xmath4 melts at rhic and the @xmath5 is likely to melt , the @xmath3 is expected to survive  @xcite .",
    "suppression of the @xmath5 and @xmath4 should be measurable at rhic energies over a wide range of @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , it is only with a systematic study of all quarkonia states in pp , pa and aa systems that a clear understanding of the properties of dense matter will emerge  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we report preliminary results of the @xmath3 cross section at midrapidity obtained with the star detector in p+p collisions at @xmath0 gev via the dielectron decay channel .",
    "the main detectors used in the star quarkonia program are the tpc ( time projection chamber )  @xcite and the emc ( electromagnetic calorimeter )  @xcite .",
    "they both have a large acceptance : pseudorapidity @xmath7 and full azimuthal coverage .",
    "the combined capabilities of the tpc+emc for electron identification , together with the triggering capabilities of the emc are the two pillars of the star quarkonium program . in particular , the emc trigger allows us to sample the full luminosity delivered by rhic to look for the high - mass di - electron signals characteristic of the @xmath8 decay .",
    "we now summarize the quarkonia triggers developed for this purpose .",
    "the architecture of the star quarkonia trigger is based on a two - level system comprising a level-0 ( l0 ) hardware component ( @xmath9s ) and a level-2 ( l2 ) software component ( @xmath10s ) .",
    "l0 requires an emc tower to have energy above 3.5 gev and the associated trigger patch consisting of @xmath11 towers to have total energy above 4.3 gev , coupled with a minimum bias condition .",
    "computer simulations show that @xmath3 with both daughter electrons having energy above 3 gev account for 95% of all @xmath3 that decay within the acceptance of the emc .",
    "the advantage of triggering at such high - energy is the added hadron rejection power @xmath12 of the emc towers .",
    "l2 performs tower clustering to reclaim energy leaked into neighboring towers and improve mass resolution .",
    "cuts are applied on the invariant mass @xmath13 and the opening angle @xmath14 between clusters .",
    "the relatively clean environment of the higher mass states permits the trigger to be utilized in au+au collisions as well .",
    "the trigger is highly efficient and limited only by luminosity affording the star detector with its large acceptance a position of prominence for @xmath3 measurements . because of the small @xmath3 cross section , large luminosity and acceptance are necessary .",
    "the @xmath1 l0-l2 trigger chain is very similar to that of the @xmath3 .",
    "it is suitable only in p+p and d+au collisions since in high multiplicity nuclear collisions the trigger rejection drops dramatically . the trigger was successfully tested in 2005 and 2006 , and the @xmath1 analysis is in progress .",
    "in 2006 , with full emc acceptance , star sampled 9 pb@xmath15 of integrated luminosity .",
    "two different trigger setups were deployed but the analysis focused on one setup with integrated luminosity @xmath16 ( syst ) .",
    "electrons were identified by selecting charged particle tracks with specific @xmath17 ionization energy loss in the tpc that deposited more than 3 gev of energy in an emc tower .",
    "electron - positron pairs were then combined to produce the invariant mass spectrum . finally , like - sign electron pairs were combined to form the invariant mass spectrum of the background which was subtracted from the signal and background ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : upsilon_peak ] .     at @xmath0 gev signal and background with",
    "statistical error bars from combining unlike - sign pairs ( electrons and positrons ) .",
    "the red background results from combining like - sign pairs .",

    "the blue curve is a gaussian fit .",

    "right panel : background - subtracted @xmath3 signal with statistical error bars .",
    "the blue curve is a gaussian fit .",
    "the green vertical bars mark the boundaries of integration for the yield.,width=264 ]    star simulation of the bottomonia states show that the star detector can not resolve individual states of the @xmath3 family due to finite momentum resolution and electron bremsstrahlung given the current material budget between the interaction vertex and the tpc entrance window .",
    "therefore , the yield reported here is for the combined @xmath18 states .",
    "the total yield was extracted by integrating the invariant mass spectrum from 7 to 11 gev/@xmath19 .",
    "the width of the peak @xmath20 1 gev/@xmath19 was found to be consistent with simulation .",
    "the significance of the signal was estimated at @xmath21 .",
    "the cross section was calculated with the formula :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the branching ratio for @xmath24  @xcite , @xmath25 ( stat . ) is the raw yield , @xmath26 is the rapidity interval and @xmath27 ( syst . ) is the efficiency for reconstructing members of the @xmath3 family . @xmath28",
    "is the geometrical acceptance , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the trigger efficiencies for l0 and l2 , respectively .",
    "@xmath31 is the efficiency for reconstructing a single electron and @xmath32 is the efficiency of the invariant mass cut .",
    "we find for the cross section at midrapidity in @xmath0 gev p+p collisions @xmath33 .",
    "the systematic error is dominated by the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity .",
