    "when the best player wins , the environment is most competitive , and when the worst player wins it is the least competitive .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the model in section ii . in section iii",
    ", we analyze in detail three - player competitions , addressing situations where the best , intermediate , and worst player wins , in order .",

    "our system consists of @xmath5 players that compete against each other . in each competition",
    "@xmath0 players are randomly chosen from the total pool of players .",
    "the winner is decided based upon the ranking : the @xmath1th ranked player always wins the game [ fig .  [ ill ] ] .",
    "let @xmath6 be the number of wins of the @xmath7th ranked player in the competition , i.e. , , then @xmath8 tie - breakers are decided by a coin - toss , i.e. , when two or more players are tied , their relative ranking is determined in a completely random fashion .",
    "initially , players start with no wins , @xmath9 .     and @xmath10.,scaledwidth=37.0% ]",
    "these competition rules are relevant in a wide variety of contexts . in sports competitions ,",
    "the strongest player often emerges as the winner . in social contexts and especially in politics , being a centrist often pays off , and furthermore , there are auctions where the second highest bidder wins . finally , identifying wins with financial assets , the situation where the weakest player wins mimics a strong welfare system where the rich support the poor .",
    "we set the competition rate such that the number of competitions in a unit time equals the total number of players .",
    "thence , each player participates in @xmath0 games per unit time , and furthermore , the average number of wins @xmath11 simply equals time @xmath12 at large times , it is natural to analyze the winning rate , that is , the number of wins normalized by time , @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , from our definition of the competition rate , the average winning rate equals one @xmath14    our goal is to characterize how the number of wins , or alternatively , the winning rate are distributed in the long time limit .",
    "we note that since the players are randomly chosen in each competition , the number of games played by a given player is a fluctuating quantity . nevertheless ,",
    "since this process is completely random , fluctuations in the number of games played by a given player scale as the square - root of time , and thus , these fluctuations become irrelevant in the long time limit .",
    "also , we consider the thermodynamic limit , @xmath15 .",
    "we first analyze the three player case , @xmath16 , because it nicely demonstrates the full spectrum of possibilities .",
    "we detail the three scenarios where the best , intermediate , and worst , players win in order .",
    "let us first analyze the case where the best player wins .",
    "that is , if the number of wins of the three players are @xmath17 , then the game outcome is as follows @xmath18    let @xmath19 be the probability distribution of players with @xmath20 wins at time @xmath21 .",
    "this distribution is properly normalized , @xmath22 , and it evolves according to the nonlinear difference - differential equation @xmath23 here , we used the cumulative distributions @xmath24 and @xmath25 of players with fitness smaller than and larger than @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the two cumulative distributions are of course related , @xmath27 .",
    "the first pair of terms accounts for games where it is unambiguous who the top player is .",
    "the next pair accounts for two - way ties for first , and the last pair for three way ties .",
    "each pair of terms contains a gain term and a loss term that differ by a simple index shift",
    ". the binomial coefficients account for the number of distinct ways there are to choose the players .",
    "for example , there are @xmath28 ways to choose the top player in the first case .",
    "this master equation should be solved subject to the initial condition @xmath29 and the boundary condition @xmath30 .",
    "one can verify by summing the equations that the total probability is conserved @xmath31 , and that the average fitness @xmath32 evolves as in ( [ kav ] ) , @xmath33 .    for theoretical analysis",
    ", it is convenient to study the cumulative distribution @xmath34 . summing the rate equations ( [ re - f - a ] )",
    ", we obtain closed equations for the cumulative distribution @xmath35 here , we used @xmath36 .",
    "this master equation is subject to the initial condition @xmath37 and the boundary condition @xmath38 .",
    "we are interested in the long time limit .",
    "since the number of wins is expected to grow linearly with time , @xmath39 , we may treat the number of wins as a continuous variable , @xmath40 .",
    "asymptotically , since @xmath41 and @xmath42 , etc . , second- and higher - order terms become negligible compared with the first order terms . to leading order",
    ", the cumulative distribution obeys the following partial differential equation @xmath43 from dimensional analysis of this equation , we anticipate that the cumulative distribution obeys the scaling form @xmath44 with the boundary conditions @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "in other words , instead of concentrating on the number of wins @xmath26 , we focus on the winning rate @xmath13 . in the long time limit",
    ", the cumulative distribution of winning rates @xmath47 becomes stationary .",
    "of course , the actual distribution of winning rates @xmath48 also becomes stationary , and it is related to the distribution of the number of wins by the scaling transformation @xmath49 with @xmath50 . since the average winning rate equals one ( [ xav ] ) , the distribution of winning rates must satisfy @xmath51    substituting the definition ( [ phi - def ] ) into the master equation ( [ f - eq - a ] ) , the stationary distribution satisfies @xmath52=0.\\ ] ] there are two solutions : ( i ) the constant solution , @xmath53 , and ( ii ) the algebraic solution @xmath54 .",
    "invoking the boundary condition @xmath55 we find [ fig .",

    "this result generalizes the linear stationary distribution found for two player games @xcite .    ) for the case @xmath16 , @xmath2.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    initially , all the players are identical , but by the random competition process , some players end up at the top of the standings and some at the bottom .",
    "this directly follows from the fact that the distribution of winning rates is nontrivial . also , since @xmath57 as @xmath58 , the distribution of winning - rate is nonuniform and there are many more players with very low winning rates . when the number of players is finite , a clear ranking emerges , and every player wins at a different rate .",
    "moreover , after a transient regime , the rankings do not change with time [ fig .",
    "[ kta ] ] .     versus time @xmath21 when the best player wins .",
    "shown are results of simulations with 20 players.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we note that in our scaling analysis , situations where there is a two- or three - way tie for first do not contribute .",
    "this is the case because the number of wins grows linearly with time and therefore , the probability of finding two players with the same number of wins can be neglected .",
    "such terms do affect how the distribution of the number of wins approaches a stationary form , but they do not affect the final form of the stationary distribution .",
    "next , we address the case where the intermediate player wins , @xmath59 now , there are four terms in the master equation @xmath60 the first pair of terms accounts for situations where there are no ties and then the combinatorial prefactor is a product of the number of ways to choose the intermediate player times the number of ways to choose the best player .",
    "the next two pairs of terms account for situations where there is a two - way tie for best and worst , respectively .",
    "again , the last pair of terms accounts for three - way ties .",
    "these equations conserve the total probability , @xmath61 , and they are also consistent with ( [ kav ] ) .    summing the rate equations ( [ re - f - b ] ) , we obtain closed equations for the cumulative distribution @xmath62 for clarity , we use both of the cumulative distributions , but note that this equation is definitely closed in @xmath34 because of the relation @xmath63 . taking the continuum limit and keeping only first - order derivatives , the cumulative distribution obeys the following partial differential equation with the boundary conditions @xmath64 and @xmath65 . substituting the definition of the stationary distribution of winning rates ( [ phi - def ] ) into this partial differential equation , we arrive at @xmath66=0,\\ ] ] an equation that is subject to the boundary conditions @xmath45 and @xmath55 .",

    "integrating by parts , we obtain an implicit equation for the location of the discontinuity @xmath76 substituting the stationary solution ( [ phi - sol - b ] ) into this equation and performing the integration , we find after several manipulations that the location of the singularity satisfies the cubic equation @xmath77 .",
    "the location of the discontinuity is therefore @xmath78 this completes the solution ( [ phi - sol - b ] ) for the scaling function .",
    "the size of the discontinuity follows from @xmath79 .     versus time @xmath21 when the intermediate player wins . shown",
    "are results of simulations with 20 players.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    there is an alternative way to find the location of the discontinuity .",
    "let us transform the integration over @xmath80 into an integration over @xmath81 using the equality @xmath82 this transforms the equation for the location of the discontinuity ( [ x0-eq ] ) into an equation for the size of the jump @xmath83 substituting @xmath84 we arrive at the cubic equation for the variable @xmath85 , @xmath86 . the relevant solution is @xmath87 , from which we conclude @xmath88 . for three - player games , there is no particular advantage for either of the two approaches : both ( [ x0-eq ] ) and ( [ phi0-eq ] ) involve cubic polynomials .",
    "however , in general , the latter approach is superior because it does not require an explicit solution for @xmath47 .",
    "the scaling function corresponding to the win - number distribution is therefore @xmath89 where @xmath90 denotes the kronecker delta function .",
    "the win - number distribution contains two components .",
    "the first is a nontrivial distribution of players with winning rate @xmath91 and the second reflects that a finite fraction of the players have the maximal winning rate @xmath92 .",
    "thus , the standings have a two - tier structure .",
    "players in the lower tier have different strengths and there is a clear differentiation among them [ fig .  [ ktb ] ] .",
    "players in the upper - tier are essentially equal in strength as they all win with the same rate .",
    "a fraction @xmath87 belongs to the lower tier and a complementary fraction @xmath93 belongs to the upper tier .",
    "interestingly , the upper - tier has the form of a condensate .",
    "we note that a condensate , located at the bottom , rather than at the top as is the case here , was found in the diversity model in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "we see that in general , when the best player wins there is no discontinuity and @xmath116 . as for three - player games ,",

    "thus , we focus on the behavior of these two parameters and pay special attention to the large-@xmath0 limit . substituting the stationary distribution ( [ phi - sol - e ] ) into the constraint ( [ constraint ] )",
    ", the maximal winning rate @xmath74 follows from the very same eq .",

    "@xmath127 we relate the definite integral above with the combinatorial constant in ( [ constant ] ) . substituting the governing equation for the stationary distribution ( [ phi - eq - e ] ) into the equation for the size of the lower - tier ( [ phi0-eq ] )",
    "gives @xmath128 using the relation ( [ relation ] ) , we arrive at a convenient equation for the size of the lower tier @xmath85 @xmath129 this is a polynomial of degree @xmath126 .",
    "let us consider the limit @xmath130 and @xmath131 with the ratio @xmath132 kept constant .",
    "for example , the case @xmath133 corresponds to the situation where the median player is the winner . to solve the governing equation for the stationary distribution in the large-@xmath0 limit",

    "therefore , the stationary distribution contains two steps when the number of players participating in each game diverges [ fig .",
    "[ limit - fig ] ] @xmath145 the stationary distribution corresponding to the number of wins therefore consists of two delta - functions : .",
    "thus , as the number of players participating in a game grows , the winning rate of players in the lower tier diminishes , and eventually , they become indistinguishable .    for example",
    ", for @xmath123 , the quantity @xmath85 is roughly linear in @xmath146 and the maximal winning rate @xmath74 is roughly proportional to @xmath147 [ fig .",
    "[ n4n10-fig ] ] .",
    "nevertheless , for moderate @xmath0 there are still significant deviations from the limiting asymptotic behavior .",
    "a refined asymptotic analysis shows that @xmath148 and that @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the convergence is slow and nonuniform ( i.e. , @xmath146-dependent ) . despite the slow convergence ,",
    "the infinite-@xmath0 limit is very instructive as it shows that the structure of the lower - tier becomes trivial as the number of players in a game becomes very large .",
    "it also shows that the size of the jump becomes proportional to the rank of the winning player .",

    "( [ limit ] ) , the points @xmath150 all lie on the curve @xmath151.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    it is also possible to analytically obtain the stationary distribution in the limit of small winning rates , @xmath58 . since the cumulative distribution is small , @xmath152 , the governing equation ( [ phi - eq - e ] ) can be approximated by @xmath153 . as a result , the cumulative distribution vanishes algebraically @xmath154 as @xmath58 .",
    "this behavior holds as long as @xmath155 .",
    "* worst player wins ( @xmath4 ) : * in this case , the roots of the polynomial ( [ phi - eq - e ] ) are not physical because they correspond to either monotonically increasing solutions or they are larger than unity .",
    "thus , the only solution is a constant and following the same reasoning as above we conclude that the stationary distribution is the step function ( [ phi - sol - c ] ) .",
    "again , the upper tier disappears and all players have the same winning rate . in other words , there is very strong parity .",
    "we note that while the winning rate of all players approaches the same value , there are still small differences between players . based on the behavior for two - player games , we expect that the distribution of the number of wins follows a traveling wave form @xmath156 as @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "as the differences among the players are small , the ranking continually evolves with time .",
    "such analysis is beyond the scope of the approach above .",
    "nevertheless , the dependence on the number of players may be quite interesting .",
    "let us imagine that wins represent wealth .",
    "then , the strong players are the rich and the the weak players are the poor . competitions in which the weakest player wins mimic a strong welfare mechanism where the poor benefits from interactions with the rich . in such a scenario ,",
    "social inequalities are small .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied multi - player games where the winner is decided deterministically based upon the ranking .",
    "we focused on the long time limit where situations with two or more tied players are generally irrelevant .",
    "we analyzed the stationary distribution of winning rates using scaling analysis of the nonlinear master equations .",
    "the shape of the stationary distribution reflects three qualitatively different types of behavior . when the best player wins , there are clear differences between the players as they advance at different rates .",
    "when an intermediate player wins , the standings are organized into two tiers .",
    "the upper tier has the form of a condensate with all of the top players winning at the same rate ; in contrast , the lower tier players win at different rates .",
    "interestingly , the same qualitative behavior emerges when the second player wins as when the second to last player wins . when the worst player wins , all of the players are equal in strength",
    ".    the behavior in the limit of an infinite number of players greatly simplifies . in this limit",
    ", the change from upper tier only standings to lower tier only standings occurs in a continuous fashion .",
    "moreover , the size of the upper tier is simply proportional to the rank of the winner while the maximal winning rate is inversely proportional to this parameter .    in the context of sports competitions , these results are consistent with our intuition .",
    "we view standings that clearly differentiate the players as a competitive environment .",
    "then , having the best player win results in the most competitive environment , while having the worst player win leads to the least competitive environment . as the rank of the winning player",
    "is varied from best to worst , the environment is gradually changed from highly competitive to non - competitive .",
    "this is the case because the size of the competitive tier decreases as the strength of the winning player declines .    in the context of social dynamics , these results have very clear implications : they suggest that a welfare strategy that aims to eliminate social hierarchies must be based on supporting the very poor as all players become equal when the weakest benefits from competitions .",
    "our asymptotic analysis focuses on the most basic characteristic , the winning rate .",
    "however , there are interesting questions that may be asked when tiers of equal - strength players emerge . for example",
    ", the structure of the upper tier can be further explored by characterizing relative fluctuations in the strengths of the top players .",
    "similarly , the dynamical evolution of the ranking when all players are equally strong may be interesting as well ."
