    "scalar fields ( sf ) play an important role in particle physics , astrophysics , and cosmology @xcite .",
    "their evolution is usually described by the klein - gordon ( kg ) equation @xcite which can be viewed as a relativistic extension of the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "the kg equation was one of the first attempts to unify the ideas of quantum mechanics and einstein s theory of special relativity .",
    "it describes the evolution of a sf @xmath2 whose excitations are bosonic particles of spin zero .",
    "these particles are neutral for a real sf and charged for a complex sf .",
    "the kg equation usually involves a potential @xmath3 that takes self - interaction into account .",
    "for example , @xmath4-mesons , higgs bosons and axions are described by the kg equation .",
    "sf are also present in the theory of superstrings as well as in a large number of kaluza - klein and supergravity models .    the coupling between the kg equation and gravity through the einstein equations , leading to the klein - gordon - einstein ( kge ) equations , was first considered in the context of boson stars @xcite .",
    "initially , the study of boson stars was motivated by the axion field , a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson of the peccei - quinn phase transition , that was proposed as a possible solution to the strong cp problem in qcd . in the early works of kaup @xcite and ruffini and bonazzola @xcite",
    ", it was assumed that the bosons have no self - interaction . for a boson mass @xmath5 ,",
    "the maximum mass of boson stars is very small , of the order of @xmath6 .",
    "this corresponds to mini boson stars like axion black holes .",
    "the mass of these mini boson stars may be too small to be astrophysically relevant .",
    "they could play a role , however , if they exist in the universe in abundance or if the axion mass is extraordinarily small ( less than @xmath7 ) leading to macroscopic objects with a mass @xmath8 comparable to the mass of the sun ( or even larger ) @xcite .",
    "it has also been proposed that stable boson stars with a boson mass @xmath9 could mimic supermassive black holes ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) that reside at the center of galaxies @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , colpi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered the case where the bosons have a repulsive self - interaction described by a @xmath0 potential and showed that , for @xmath12 , the maximum mass of boson stars can be of the order of the solar mass @xmath13 , similar to the mass of neutron stars .",
    "therefore , a self - interaction can significantly change the physical dimensions of boson stars , making them much more astrophysically interesting .",
    "it has also been proposed that dark matter ( dm ) halos may be made of a sf described by the kge equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "actually , at the galactic scale , the newtonian limit is valid so dm halos can be described by the schrdinger - poisson ( sp ) equations or by the gross - pitaevskii - poisson ( gpp ) equations . in that case , the wavefunction @xmath14 describes a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) at @xmath15 , and the self - interaction of the bosons is measured by their scattering length @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , dm halos could be gigantic quantum objects made of becs .",
    "the wave properties of bosonic dm may stabilize the system against gravitational collapse , providing halo cores and sharply suppressing small - scale linear power .",
    "this may solve the problems of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model such as the cusp problem and the missing satellite problem .",
    "the scalar field dark matter ( sfdm ) model and the bec dark matter ( becdm ) model , also called @xmath17 dm models , have received much attention in the last years . in the non - interacting case @xcite",
    ", the mass of the bosons must be extremely small , of the order of @xmath18 , in order to account for the mass and size of dwarf dm halos that are completely condensed .",
    "ultralight scalar fields like axions may have such small masses .",
    "this corresponds to `` fuzzy cold dark matter '' @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "when a repulsive self - interaction is taken into account @xcite , the characteristics of dwarf dm halos can be reproduced with a much larger boson mass @xmath19 ( satisfying the limit @xmath20 obtained from cosmological considerations @xcite ) and a scattering length @xmath21 ( satisfying the constraint @xmath22 set by the bullet cluster @xcite ) .",
    "dwarf halos are purely condensed .",
    "large dark matter halos have a core - halo structure resulting from gravitational cooling @xcite .",
    "they are made of a solitonic core ( bec ) surrounded by a halo of scalar radiation .",
    "scalar fields have also been introduced in cosmology .",
    "the phase of inflation in the early universe is usually described by some hypothetical sf , called the inflaton , with its origin in the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum @xcite . a variety of inflationary models that include sfs have been proposed @xcite , and sf are expected to play an important role in determining the dynamics of the early universe .",
    "inflation is generally considered to be a reasonable solution to many of the fundamental problems within the standard cosmological model .",
    "inspired by the analogy with the inflation , some authors have represented the dark energy responsible for the present acceleration of the universe by a sf called quintessence @xcite .",
    "this treatment seems to fit current observations , and unlike the cosmological constant @xmath23 , the sf evolves dynamically , leaving distinctive imprints in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and matter power spectrum .    since dm may be a sf",
    ", it is of considerable interest to study the cosmological implications of this scenario .",
    "the cosmological evolution of a spatially homogeneous non - interacting real sf described by the kge equations competing with baryonic matter , radiation and dark energy , was considered by matos _",
    "they found that real sfs display fast oscillations but that , on the mean , they reproduce the cosmological predictions of the standard @xmath23cdm model .",
    "the study of perturbations was considered by surez and matos @xcite for a self - interacting real sf described by the klein - gordon - poisson ( kgp ) equations and by magaa _",
    "@xcite for a non - interacting real sf described by the kge equations .",
    "these studies show that the perturbations can grow in the linear regime , leading , in the nonlinear regime , to the formation of structures corresponding to dm halos .",
    "this is in agreement with the early work of khlopov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite who studied the jeans instability of a relativistic sf in a static background .",
    "the case of a complex self - interacting sf representing becdm was considered by chavanis @xcite in the context of newtonian cosmology .",
    "his study is based on the gpp equations .",
    "the jeans instability of a homogeneous self - gravitating bec in a static background is studied in @xcite .",
    "the evolution of perturbations of becdm in an expanding einstein - desitter ( eds ) universe is considered in @xcite .",
    "it is found that the perturbations grow faster in becdm as compared to @xmath23cdm .",
    "harko @xcite and chavanis @xcite independently developed a relativistic bec cosmology by assuming that the equation of state of becdm is given by @xmath24 , which corresponds to the classical equation of state of becs @xcite where @xmath25 is replaced by @xmath26 .",
    "however , the identification of the energy density @xmath27 with the rest - mass density @xmath25 is only valid in a weakly relativistic regime , so the extrapolation of their results to early times is not correct ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "recently , li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite developed an exact relativistic cosmology for a complex self - interacting sf / bec based on the kge equations .",
    "they studied the evolution of the homogeneous background and showed that the universe undergoes three successive phases : a stiff matter era , followed by a radiation era due to the sf ( that exists only for self - interacting sfs ) , and finally a matter era similar to cdm .",
    "they compared their theoretical results with observations in order to constrain the parameters @xmath28 of the sf .    instead of working directly in terms of a sf",
    ", we can adopt a fluid approach and work with hydrodynamic equations . in the case of the schrdinger equation",
    ", this hydrodynamic approach was introduced by madelung @xcite .",
    "he showed that the schrdinger equation is equivalent to the euler equations for an irrotational fluid with an additional quantum potential arising from the finite value of @xmath29 .",
    "this hydrodynamic formulation was criticized , or disregarded , by many authors ( e.g. , pauli ) in the early years of quantum mechanics because it lacks a clear physical interpretation in the case where the schrdinger equation describes just one particle .",
    "however , it takes more sense when the schrdinger equation ( or the gp equation ) describes a bec made of many particles in the same quantum state @xcite . in that case",
    ", the bec can be interpreted as a real fluid described by quantum euler equations .",
    "] this hydrodynamic representation has been used by bhmer and harko @xcite and by chavanis @xcite among others in the case of becdm and in the case of bec stars @xcite .",
    "this hydrodynamic approach has been generalized by surez and matos @xcite in the context of the kg equation .",
    "they used it to study the formation of structures in the universe , assuming that dm is in the form of a fundamental sf with a @xmath30 potential @xcite .",
    "they also studied the phase transition of a real sf due to a @xmath31 symmetry of its potential @xcite .",
    "in the works @xcite , the sf is taken to be real and the gravitational potential is introduced by hand in the kg equation , and assumed to be determined by the classical poisson equation where the source is the rest - mass density @xmath25 .",
    "this leads to the kgp equations .",
    "however , this treatment is not self - consistent since it combines relativistic and nonrelativistic equations . in this article",
    ", we derive the hydrodynamic representation of a complex sf coupled to gravity through the einstein equations in the weak field approximation . in this way , we develop a self - consistent relativistic treatment . throughout this work",
    ", we use the newtonian gauge which takes into account metric perturbations up to first order .",
    "we consider only scalar perturbations .",
    "this is sufficient if we are interested in calculating observational consequences of the sf dynamics in the linear regime . after having derived the hydrodynamic equations , we study the evolution of the homogeneous background and the evolution of small perturbations in a static and in an expanding universe using the hydrodynamic representation . we compare our results with those obtained from the heuristic kgp equations .",
    "we argue that this simplified model is not sufficient to study the evolution of the perturbations in the linear relativistic regime .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to develop a general formalism .",
