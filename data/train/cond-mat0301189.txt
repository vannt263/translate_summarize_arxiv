    "graphite is a stable and abundant solid form of pure carbon@xcite . in this form ,",
    "three valence electrons of each carbon atom form three strong @xmath8 trigonal bonds to three nearest neighbors with an equal distance of 0.142 nm , while the fourth valence electron from different carbon atoms interacts by weak @xmath7 bonds perpendicular to successive sheets with an inter - plane distance of 0.34 nm@xcite .",
    "diamond is another slightly less stable and less abundant crystallographic form of pure carbon @xcite , where each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four neighbors via @xmath9 hybridization at the apexes of a regular tetrahedron . in 1985 ,",
    "a fascinating molecule , named @xmath1 ( a truncated icosahedron with 20 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal faces , and 60 vertices , each of which is at the intersection of two hexagonal and one pentagonal faces ) was discovered by kroto _",
    "et al._@xcite , and a new form of pure carbon , named fullerenes@xcite , was born .",
    "fullerenes can crystallize in a variety of three - dimensional structures@xcite , being made from an even number of three - coordinated @xmath10 carbon atoms that arrange themselves into 12 pentagonal faces and any number ( @xmath11 ) of hexagonal faces@xcite .",
    "the macroscopic synthesis of soot@xcite , which contains @xmath1 and other fullerenes in large compounds , plus the straightforward purification techniques of the soot which make the pure fullerene materials available , have led to extensive studies of fullerenes@xcite .",
    "doped fullerenes have also attracted a great deal of interest due to their remarkable structural , electronic , optical and magnetic properties@xcite .",
    "for example , the doped fullerenes can exhibit large third - order optical nonlinearities@xcite and be ideal candidates as photonic devices including all - optical switching , data processing , and eye and sensor protection@xcite .",
    "another example is alkali - doped @xmath12 crystals , which can become superconducting @xcite , for example , at a critical temperature @xmath13 k @xcite .",
    "in addition to the endohedral doping ( inside fullerenes ) and exohedral doping ( outside fullerenes ) , there is another type of doping , named _ substitutional doping _",
    ", where one or more carbon atoms of fullerene are substituted by other atoms@xcite , due to the unique structural and electronic properties of fullerenes . because boron and nitrogen bracket carbon in the periodic table , much attention has been paid to alternate boron- and/or nitrogen - doped compounds@xcite . over the past 10 years , boron and nitrogen atoms have been successfully used to replace carbon atoms of @xmath1 and synthesize many kinds of heterofullerenes , @xmath14 @xcite . in 1995 , a very efficient method of synthesizing @xmath15 was reported @xcite . this method has led to a number of detailed studies of the physical and chemical properties of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "very recently , @xmath1 with more than one nitrogen atom replacing carbon atoms in the cage has been synthesized by hultman _",
    "et al._@xcite , and the existence of a novel @xmath0 aza - fullerene@xcite was reported .",
    "hence , it would be interesting and useful to investigate and predict the structural , electronic , vibrational and magnetic properties of this aza - fullerene by performing detailed first - principles calculations .",
    "this forms main purpose of the present paper .",
    "fullerenes have been challenging molecules for first - principles calculations because of their size@xcite .",
    "recent advances in _ ab initio _ methods and parallel computing have brought a substantial improvement in capabilities for predicting the properties of large molecules .",
    "the coupled cluster method has been used to predict phenomena in @xmath16@xcite .",
    "other first - principles methods , which are less demanding in terms of computation cost than the coupled cluster method , have been used for much larger fullerenes and carbon nanotubes .",
    "for example , @xmath1 @xcite has been studied with self - consistent field ( scf ) and moller - plesset second - order ( mp2 ) theory , @xmath17 @xcite and carbon nanotubes@xcite with density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , and @xmath18 @xcite with the hartree - fock ( hf ) method .    @xmath1 has the highest symmetry @xmath19 in the point group , two types of carbon - carbon ( cc ) bonds ( one single bond c - c shared by adjacent five- and six - membered carbon rings and one double bond c = c by adjacent six - membered carbon rings ) , and two kinds of bond angles ( one angle between two adjacent c - c bonds , and another one between a c = c bond and a adjacent c - c bond)@xcite . in section",
    "ii , we perform full geometry optimizations of @xmath0 as well as @xmath1 with both dft and restricted hf ( rhf ) methods . it is found that the @xmath0 aza - fullerene has several distinguishing features : only one nitrogen atom per pentagon , two nitrogen atoms preferentially sitting in one hexagon , @xmath2 symmetry , six unique nitrogen - carbon ( nc ) and nine unique cc bonds .",
    "the mulliken charge analysis shows that the doped nitrogen atoms in @xmath0 exist as electron acceptors and three - fourths of the carbon atoms as electron donors .",
    "our best cc bond lengths and radius of @xmath1 calculated with b3lyp/6 - 31 g * are in excellent agreement with experiment .",
    "total energy calculations of the optimized @xmath0 and @xmath1 are discussed in section iii .",
    "it is found that the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) is a doubly degenerate level with @xmath3 symmetry and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) is a nondegenerate level with @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "the calculated homo - lumo energy gap of @xmath0 is about 1 ev smaller than that of @xmath1 . for both molecules ,",
    "the total energies calculated with sto-3 g , 3 - 21 g and 6 - 31 g basis sets differ from the 6 - 31 g * results by about 1.5% , 0.6% and 0.05% , respectively , and the homo - lumo gaps decrease about 5 ev due to electron correlations . for @xmath1 ,",
    "our calculated results are in agreement with other groups calculations , and our best homo - lumo energy gap calculated with b3lyp/6 - 31 g * is in agreement with experiment .    when an external electric field is applied to a molecule ,",
    "its charges are redistributed and dipoles are induced or reoriented@xcite .",
    "the relation between the dipole moment @xmath20 and the applied field @xmath21 can be written as@xcite @xmath22 where @xmath21 is the electric field , @xmath23 is the permanent dipole moment , @xmath24 is the dipole polarizability , @xmath25 is the first - order hyperpolarizability , and @xmath26 is the second - order hyperpolarizability .",
    "the static dipole polarizability ( sdp ) measures the ability of the valence electrons to find a configuration which screens a static external field @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that molecules with many delocalized valence electrons should display large sdps@xcite .",
    "the first- and second - order hyperpolarizabilities play a key role in the description of nonlinear optical phenomena since a time - varying polarization can act as the source of new components of the electromagnetic field@xcite . in section iv",
    ", we calculate the sdps and first- and second - order hyperpolarizabilities of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in comparison to isolated carbon or nitrogen atoms",
    ", we find an enhancement in the sdp due to the delocalized @xmath7 electrons in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the calculated sdp for @xmath12 is in agreement with experiment .",
    "the average second - order hyperpolarizability of @xmath0 is about 55% larger than that of @xmath1 .",
    "when a material is doped , its mechanical , electronic , magnetic and optical properties change @xcite .",
    "the ability to control such induced changes is vital to progress in material science .",
    "raman and infrared ( ir ) spectroscopic techniques@xcite are useful experimental tools to investigate how doping modifies the structural and dynamical properties of the pristine material and to understand the physical origin of such induced changes . over the past 10 years",
    ", both techniques have been used widely to study the vibrational properties of @xmath1 @xcite , its derivative compounds @xcite , and ( doped ) carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath1 has in total 46 vibrational modes including 4 ir - active @xcite and 10 raman - active vibrational modes@xcite .",
    "these studies have offered a good guide to the phonon spectrum in the solid state of these materials . in section",
    "v , we perform a vibrational analysis and calculate the infrared ( ir ) intensities of @xmath0 . fifty eight ir - active ( i.e. , 29 doubly - degenerate and 29 non - degenerate modes ) and 58 raman - active ( i.e. , 29 doubly - degenerate unpolarized and 29 non - degenerate polarized ) frequencies are determined .",
    "the best vibrational frequencies and ir results for @xmath1 calculated with b3lyp are in excellent agreement with experiment and demonstrate the desirable efficiency and accuracy of this theory for obtaining quantitative information on the vibrational properties of these materials .",
    "comparison with other groups calculations of @xmath1 is made and discussed .",
    "high resolution nmr @xcite gives spectra which can be analyzed to yield parameters such as the nuclear magnetic shielding @xmath27 @xcite and the nuclear spin - spin coupling @xmath28@xcite , which characterize molecular systems and structures .",
    "both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are determined by the electronic environments of the nuclei involved .",
    "a satisfactory theoretical description of the distribution of electrons in a molecule can lead to reliable predictions of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which have a number of applications , such as the identification of the conformation or structure of the species present in a given sample . in section",
    "vi the giao ( gauge - including atomic orbital ) @xcite and the csgt ( continuous set of gauge transformations ) @xcite methods are utilized for calculating the nuclear magnetic shielding tensor @xmath27 in @xmath0 and @xmath1 at both the hf and dft levels of theory .",
    "eight @xmath5 and two @xmath6 nmr spectral signals are predicted for @xmath0 .",
    "our best calculated nmr results for @xmath1 are in excellent agreement with experiment .",
    "finally , we end in section vii by giving a summary and outlook on the potential applications of @xmath0 .",
    "the geometries of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 were fully optimized by using the gaussian 98 program@xcite , where we have employed both rhf and dft methods .",
    "also we discuss the effects of basis sets by considering sto-3 g , 3 - 21 g , 6 - 31 g and 6 - 31g*@xcite . for the dft method",
    ", we use the b3lyp hybrid functional@xcite .    * fig.1 * : geometric structure of @xmath0 .",
    "the site numbers \\{5 , 9 , 14 , 21 , 26 , 30 , 35 , 39 , 45 , 50 , 55 , 60 } are for nitrogen atoms , while the others are for carbon atoms .    in fig.1 , we present the geometry of @xmath0 .",
    "the _ ab initio _ calculations show that @xmath0 has only one nitrogen atom per pentagon and two nitrogen atoms preferentially sit in one hexagon .",
    "the symmetry of @xmath0 is the @xmath29 point group@xcite .",
    "the optimized distances ( or radii ) @xmath30 from the @xmath31th atom to the density center of the molecule are listed in table i. we find that there are 10 unique radii for @xmath0 , which suggest that @xmath0 is an ellipsoidal structure and has 10 unique sites ( 2 for n sites and 8 for c sites ) , while @xmath1 has an equal radius for each carbon atom .",
    "as shown in section vi , the 10 unique sites of @xmath0 can be identified by nmr experiments . comparing the b3lyp results with the rhf results",
    "shows that the radii are increased by up to 2% due to the electron correlation . comparing",
    "the 6 - 31 g and 6 - 31 g * s results shows that adding polarization functions decreases the radius of carbon sites but increases the radius of nitrogen sites . in comparison with the results of sto-3 g and the split valence basis sets",
    ", we find that increasing the basis size would lead to a decreased radius .",
    "for @xmath1 , the radius for each carbon site calculated by using b3lyp and the 6 - 31 g * basis set is 3.5502  , which is in excellent agreement with experiment ( r = 3.55  ) @xcite , the lda ( local density approximation ) calculation ( r = 3.537  ) with a pseudopotential approach ( ppa)@xcite , and the lda - based car - parrrinello molecular dynamics ( cpmd ) simulation ( r = 3.55  ) @xcite .",
    "the success of the b3lyp calculation of the @xmath1 radius demonstrates the importance of electron correlation for an accurate description of a molecular geometrical structure .",
    "the calculated net mulliken charges @xmath32 of carbon and nitrogen atoms in @xmath0 are also listed in table i. there are two unique types of nitrogen atoms in the structure .",
    "the net mulliken charges @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) on both types of n are negative , for example , @xmath35 c and @xmath36 c with b3lyp/6 - 31 g * , -0.7803 c and -0.7829 c with rhf/6 - 31g*. the net mulliken charges of the carbon atoms in @xmath0 separate into two groups : 1/4 of carbon atoms with negative @xmath32 and the remaining 3/4 with positive @xmath32 .",
    "although the mulliken charge analysis can not estimate the atomic charges quantitatively , their signs can be estimated@xcite . from these results , we find that the doped nitrogen atoms and one - fourth of the carbon atoms exist as electron acceptors , and three - fourths of the carbon atoms as electron donors",
    ". it should be mentioned that we also performed calculations of net mulliken charges of carbon and boron atoms in @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "we found that the doped boron atoms exist as electron donors and all carbon atoms as electron acceptors @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 and @xmath37 have opposite electronic polarizations , while @xmath1 is isotropic . in the case of doping into silicon , the v family in the periodic table ( for example , phosphorous ) exists as a donor , while the iii family ( for example , boron ) exists as an electron acceptor .",
    "thus , the b- or n - substituted doping in @xmath1 differs greatly from that for silicon .",
    "this is due to the unique structural and electronic properties of @xmath1 @xcite . with respect to the electron correlation and the choice of basis sets",
    ", we find that the absolute value of the net mulliken charge @xmath32 for each atom in @xmath0 increases with an increase of the basis size , but decreases due to the electron correlation or by adding polarization functions to a given basis set .",

    "our best results for @xmath1 obtained with the b3lyp hybrid dft method are in excellent agreement with experiment and demonstrate the needed efficiency and accuracy of this method for obtaining quantitative information on the structural , electronic and vibrational properties of these materials .",
    "laser sources are widely used in the laboratory and industry .",
    "however , they are a potential hazard for eyes , thermal cameras and other optical sensors@xcite .",
    "development of optical limiters which can suppress undesired radiation and effectively decrease transmittance at high intensity or fluence is necessary .",
    "an ideal optical limiter @xcite should have reasonable linear transmittance at low input fluence ( at least of 70% ) , protecting optical sensors or eyes against laser pulses of any wavelength and pulse duration , and its output energy must remain below the optical damage threshold of sensors or eyes at high fluences .",
    "@xmath1 and fullerene derivatives are good candidates for optical limiting applications@xcite . in this paper , we found that the average second - order hyperpolarizability of @xmath0 is about 55% larger than that of @xmath1 .",
    "hence , it is expected that @xmath0 is also a good candidate for optical limiting applications .",
    "non - linear optical ( nlo ) materials have vast technological applications in telecommunications , optical data storage and optical information processing .",
    "the search for materials with such properties is the subject of intense research@xcite .",
    "organic molecules , which have high nlo response , could be designed by linking appropriate electron - donor and acceptor groups with a spacer made of one or several units of conjugated molecules such as a polyene or an aromatic chain@xcite .",
    "based on such donor - acceptor model , we can link donor @xmath0 and acceptor @xmath1 with a polyene or an aromatic chain and design one kind of organic molecules . in such organic molecules , charge would migrate from @xmath0 to @xmath1 upon electronic excitation , giving rise to a large dipole moment along the direction connecting the donor / acceptor pair . thus",
    ", large nlo response is expected in these donor / acceptor - based molecules .",
    "carbon nanotubes are promising materials for building electronic devices , in particular , field effect transistors ( fets ) @xcite .",
    "however , single - walled carbon nanotube ( swnt ) fets built from as - grown tubes are unipolar @xmath94-type , i.e. , there is no electron current flow even at large positive gate biases .",
    "this behavior suggests the presence of a schottky barrier at the metal - nanotube contact . obviously , the capability to produce @xmath95-type transistors is important technologically , as it allows the fabrication of nanotube - based complementary logic devices and circuits @xcite .",
    "very recently , bockrath _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have reported a controlled chemical doping of individual semiconducting swnt ropes by reversibly intercalating and deintercalating potassium .",
    "potassium doping could change the carriers in the ropes from holes to electrons@xcite .",
    "their experiments open the way toward other experiments that require controlled doping such as making nanoscale @xmath94-@xmath95 junctions . as shown in this paper",
    ", @xmath0 is a good electron donor .",
    "we found that incorporating @xmath0 into a ( 10,10 ) semiconducting swnt@xcite would result in -0.26 e charge@xcite on the nanotube forming a @xmath95-type swnt - based transistor .    to obtain molecular rectification ,",
    "the lumo of the acceptor should lie at or slightly above the fermi level of the electrode and above the homo of the donor@xcite .",
    "hence it is important to search for desired donor / acceptor pairs which satisfy those conditions .",
    "the acceptor / donor pair , @xmath37/@xmath0 , actually is demonstrated to be an ideal candidate for molecular electronics@xcite .",
    "for example , we have shown that a rectifier formed by @xmath37/@xmath0 pair shows a perfect rectification behavior @xcite .    as shown before , @xmath37 and @xmath0",
    "fcc solids are semiconducting materials . because both @xmath37 and @xmath0 molecules have opposite electronic polarizations , it is possible to use them to build semiconducting materials with opposite electronic polarizations .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 could have potential applications as semiconductor components , nonlinear optical materials , and possible building materials for molecular electronics and photonic devices . efficiently synthesizing @xmath0",
    "would be of great experimental interest within reach of today s technology .",
