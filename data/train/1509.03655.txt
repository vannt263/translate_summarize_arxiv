    "phase separation processes that lead to microdomains of a well - defined length - scale below the system size arise in various physical and biological systems .",
    "a prominent example is the microphase separation in block - copolymers @xcite or other soft materials , characterized by a fluid - like disorder on molecular scales and high degree of order at larger scales .",
    "here micro - scale pattern arise by a competition between thermodynamic forces that drive ( macro-)phase separation and entropic forces that limit phase separation .",
    "different mathematical models for microphase separation in di - block copolymers have been developed , in particular built on self - consistent mean field theory ( see for example @xcite and the references therein ) or density functional theory developed in @xcite that leads to the so - called ohta ",
    "kawasaki free energy .",
    "diblock - copolymer type models have also been studied on spheres and more general curved surfaces @xcite and show a variety of different stripe- or spot - like patterns .",
    "in contrast to materials science microphase separation on biological membranes is much less understood , in particular in living cells . in this contribution",
    "we present and analyze a model for so - called lipid rafts , that represent microdomains of specific lipid compositions .",
    "the outer ( plasma ) membrane of a biological cell consists of a bilayer formed by several sorts of lipid molecules and contains various other molecules like proteins and cholesterol . besides being the physical boundary of the cell the plasma membrane also plays an active part in the functioning of the cell .",
    "many studies over the past decades have shown that the structure of the outer membrane is heterogeneous with several microdomains of different lipid and/or protein composition .",
    "such domains have been clearly observed in artificial membranes such as giant unilamellar vesicles @xcite . here",
    "a ` less fluidic ' ( liquid - ordered ) phase of saturated lipids and cholesterol separates from a ` more fluidic ' ( liquid - disordered ) phase of unsaturated lipids .",
    "the nucleation of dispersed microdomains is followed by a classical coarsening process that leads to coexisting domains with a length scale of the order of the system size .",
    "the situation is much more complex and much less understood for living cells .",
    "their plasma membrane represents a heterogeneous structure with a complex and dynamic lipidic organization . the formation , maintenance and dynamics of intermediate - sized domains ( 10 - 200 nm on cells of @xmath0 size @xcite ) called ` lipid rafts ' are of prime interest .",
    "these are characterized as liquid - ordered phases that consist of saturated lipids and are enriched of cholesterol and various proteins @xcite .",
    "these rafts contribute to various biological processes including signal transduction , membrane trafficking , and protein sorting @xcite .",
    "it is therefore an interesting question to study the underlying process , by which these rafts are generated and maintained , and to understand the mechanism that allows for a dynamic distribution of intermediate - sized domains .",
    "several phenomenological mesoscale models have been proposed , see for example the review @xcite .",
    "one class of models argues that raft formation is a result of a thermodynamic equilibrium process .",
    "here one contribution is a phase separation energy that would induce a reduction of interfacial size between the raft and non - raft phases .",
    "the observation of nano - scale structures is then explained by including different additional energy contributions .",
    "one proposal is that thermal fluctuations near the critical temperature for the phase separation are responsible for the intermediate - sized structures .",
    "other explanations consider interactions between lipids and membrane proteins that could act as a kind of surfactant or could ` pin ' the interfaces due to their immobility @xcite . finally , raft formation",
    "could also be stabilized by induced changes of the membrane geometry and elasticity effects . however , as argued in @xcite , all such models are not able to reproduce key characteristics of raft dynamics ; non - equilibrium effects essentially contribute to raft formation .",
    "of particular importance are active transport processes of raft components that allow to maintain a non - equilibrium composition of the membrane .",
    "the competition between phase separation and recycling of raft components is argued to be of major importance for the dynamics and structure of lipid rafts .",
    "foret @xcite proposed a simple mechanism of raft formation in a two - component fluid membrane .",
    "this model includes a constant exchange of lipids between the membrane and a lipid reservoir as well as a typical phase separation energy .",
    "while relaxation of the latter tends to create large domains , the constant insertion and extraction of lipids in the membrane ensures indeed the formation of rafts .",
    "the emerging microdomains are static ( in contrast to the lipid rafts on actual cell membranes ) and the size distribution of these rafts is rather uniform , whereas in vivo cell membranes show a dynamic distribution of rafts of different sizes ( see the concluding remarks in @xcite and the discussion of foret s model in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , as already noticed in @xcite , whereas foret s model is motivated by including non - equilibrium effects his model can be equivalently characterized as relaxation dynamics for an effective energy given by the ohta ",
    "kawasaki energy of block - copolymers @xcite that is well - known to generate phase - separation in intermediate - sized structures .",
    "a similar model by gmez , sagus and reigada @xcite considers a ternary mixture of saturated and unsaturated lipids together with cholesterol and studies the interplay of lipid phase separation and a continuous recycling of cholesterol .",
    "an energy that is determined by the relative concentration @xmath1 of saturated lipids and the relative cholesterol concentration @xmath2 is proposed that in particular includes a phase separation energy of ginzburg  landau type for the lipid phases and a preference for cholesterol  saturated lipid interactions over cholesterol  unsaturated lipid interactions .",
    "the dynamics include an exchange term for cholesterol that is given by an in-/out - flux proportional to the difference from a constant equilibrium concentration of cholesterol at the membrane .",
    "our aim here is to propose an extended model and to present both a mathematical analysis and numerical simulations .",
    "similar as in @xcite one ingredient of our model are energetic contributions from lipid phase separation and lipid - cholesterol interaction . in addition , we include the dynamics of cholesterol inside the cytosol ( the liquid matter inside the cell ) and prescribe a detailed coupling between the processes in the cell and on the cell membrane . in particular , the outflow of cholesterol from the cytosol appears as a source - term in the membrane - cholesterol dynamic and will be characterized by a constitutive relation .",
    "we will investigate different choices of this relation and will illustrate the implications on the emergence of microdomains .      to give a detailed description of our model",
    "let us fix an open bounded set @xmath3 with smooth boundary @xmath4 representing the cell volume and cell membrane , respectively .",
    "let @xmath5 denote a rescaled relative concentration of saturated lipid molecules on the membrane , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 representing the pure saturated - lipid and pure unsaturated - lipid phases , respectively .",
    "moreover let @xmath8 denote the relative concentration of membrane - bound cholesterol , where @xmath9 indicates maximal saturation , and let @xmath10 denote the relative concentration of cytosolic cholesterol .",
    "we then prescribe a phase - separation and interaction energy of the form @xmath11 with @xmath12 a double - well potential that we choose as @xmath13 , constants @xmath14 , and @xmath15 denoting the surface gradient .",
    "the first two terms represent a classical ginzburg - landau phase separation energy , whereas the third term models a preferential binding of cholesterol to the lipid - saturated phase .",
    "we define the chemical potentials @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the laplace  beltrami operator on @xmath18 , and prescribe for the dynamics of the concentrations over a time interval of observation @xmath19 the following system of equations @xmath20&,\\\\    \\label{eq : flux }    - d \\nabla u \\cdot \\nu & = q     \\quad&\\text{on } \\gamma \\times ( 0,t]&,\\\\    \\label{eq : ch1 }    { \\partial}_t \\varphi & = { \\delta_{\\gamma}}\\mu    & \\text{on } \\gamma \\times ( 0,t]&,\\\\    \\label{eq : v }    { \\partial}_t v & = { \\delta_{\\gamma}}\\theta + q = \\frac4\\delta{\\delta_{\\gamma}}v -   \\frac2\\delta{\\delta_{\\gamma}}\\varphi + q    & \\text{on } \\gamma \\times ( 0,t],&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 denotes the outer unit - normal field of @xmath22 on @xmath18 .",
    "the system is complemented with initial conditions @xmath23 for @xmath10 , @xmath5 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the first equation represents a simple diffusion equation for the cholesterol in the bulk , the second equation characterizes the outflow of cholesterol .",
    "the third equation is a cahn  hilliard dynamics for the lipid concentration on the membrane , whereas the equation for the cholesterol on the membrane combines a mass - preserving relaxation of the interaction energy and an exchange with the bulk reservoir of cholesterol given by the flux from the cytosol .",
    "this combination yields a diffusion equation with cross - diffusion contributions and a source term .    to close the system it remains to characterize the exchange term @xmath24 .",
    "we follow here two possibilities : first we prescribe a constitutive relation by considering the membrane attachment as an elementary ` reaction ' between free sites on the membrane and cholesterol , and the detachment as proportional to the membrane cholesterol concentration , expressed by the choice @xmath25 a similar coupling of bulk ",
    "surface equations has been investigated in a reaction - diffusion model for signaling networks @xcite .",
    "as a second possibility we consider choices of @xmath24 that allow for a global free energy inequality for the coupled membrane / cytosol system .",
    "these two different cases could be considered as a distinction between open and closed systems and one important aspect of this work is to evaluate the consequences of these choices for the formation of complex phases .",
    "we remark that the system conserves both the total cholesterol and the lipid concentrations since for arbitrary choices of @xmath24 we obtain the relations @xmath26    let us contrast the above model with the ohta ",
    "kawasaki model for phase separation in diblock copolymers mentioned above .",
    "let @xmath27 denote a spatial domain , @xmath5 the relative concentration of one of the two polymers and let @xmath28 be the prescribed average of @xmath5 over @xmath29 .",
    "the mean field potential @xmath30 is then given by @xmath31 then a free energy is prescribed of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a fixed constant .",
    "note that the last term can also be written as @xmath34 .",
    "a relaxation dynamics of cahn  hilliard type is then typically considered given as @xmath35 the energies @xmath36 and @xmath37 both contain a cahn  hilliard type energy contribution that favors macro - phase separation but are different in the additional terms .",
    "however we will see below that stationary patterns for our lipid raft model with the choice are for small @xmath38 closely related to stationary points of @xmath37 .",
    "if on the other hand one considers simple choices for @xmath24 that lead to a global free energy inequality , we will observe a macro - scale separation of all saturated lipids in one connected domain .",
    "this indicates that in fact non - equilibrium processes are responsible for lipid raft formation .",
    "several asymptotic regimes are interesting in view of the different parameters included in our model .",
    "we will investigate the limit @xmath39 that corresponds to a strong segregation limit and leads to a model where no mixing of the lipid phases is allowed and the domain splits into regions where @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "this limit corresponds to the sharp interface limit in phase - field models and connects to the analysis of the ohta ",
    "kawasaki model in @xcite .",
    "since the cytosolic diffusion in biological cells is known to be much faster than lateral diffusion on the cell membrane another natural reduction of the model appears in the limit @xmath40 that leads to a non - local model defined solely on the cell membrane . finally , assuming the effect of the lipid interaction with cholesterol to be large motivates to consider the asymptotic regime @xmath41 .      in the next section we will derive the model - from thermodynamic considerations .",
    "in particular we will show that for arbitrary choices of the exchange term @xmath24 the surface equations and the bulk ( cytosolic ) equations are thermodynamically consistent when viewed as separate systems . depending on the specific choice of @xmath24 we may or may not have a global ( that is with respect to the full model ) free energy inequality . we will present examples for both cases . + in section [ sec : qualitative ] we will first derive a reduced raft model in the large cytosolic diffusion limit by formally taking @xmath40 .",
    "we then analyze the qualitative behavior of the ( reduced ) system in terms of a characterization of stationary points and an investigation of their relation to stationary points of the ohta  kawasaki model .",
    "a formal asymptotic expansion for the sharp interface reduction @xmath39 of our raft model is presented in section [ sec : sharpinterface ] . here",
    "we also briefly discuss the resulting limit problem that takes the form of a free boundary problem of mullins  sekerka type on the membrane with an additional coupling to a diffusion process in the bulk and including an interaction with the cholesterol concentration . in section [ sec : simulations ] we present numerical simulations of the full and reduced raft model .",
    "in particular , we study spinodal decomposition , coarsening scenarios and the possible appearance of raft - like structures as ( almost ) stationary states for different choices of the exchange term @xmath24 and for different parameter regimes .",
    "some conclusions are stated in the final section .",
    "in this section we will derive the governing equations for the lipid raft model from basic thermodynamical conservation laws using a free energy inequality .",
    "our arguments are similar to an approach used by gurtin @xcite , who derived the cahn - hilliard equation in the context of non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "we first of all consider the equations which have to hold on the surface , will then consider the equations in the bulk and subsequently we will couple both systems .",
    "the basic quantities on the membrane surface are the rescaled relative concentration of the saturated lipid molecules @xmath5 , the concentration @xmath8 of the membrane - bound cholesterol , the mass flux @xmath42 of the lipid molecules , the mass flux @xmath43 of the cholesterol , the mass supply of cholesterol @xmath24 , the surface free energy density @xmath44 and the chemical potential @xmath45 related to the lipid molecules and the chemical potential @xmath46 related to the surface cholesterol .",
    "the underlying laws for any surface subdomain @xmath47 are the mass balance for the lipids @xmath48 the mass balance for the surface cholesterol @xmath49 and the second law of thermodynamics , which in the isothermal situation has the form @xmath50 where @xmath44 denotes the surface free energy density and where @xmath51 is the outer unit conormal to @xmath52 in the tangent space of @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , we denote by @xmath53 the integration with respect to the @xmath54dimensional surface measure and @xmath55 denotes the partial derivatives of @xmath44 with respect to the variables related to @xmath56 in a constitutive relation @xmath57 .",
    "similarly we will denote with a subscript comma partial derivatives with respect to other variables . for",
    "a discussion of these laws in cases in which source terms are present and at the same time @xmath44 does not depend on @xmath56 we refer to @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",

    "thermodynamical models of phase transitions with an order parameter typically involve a free energy density @xmath44 which does depend on @xmath58 . in this case",
    "the free energy flux does not only involve the classical terms @xmath59 and @xmath60 but also a term @xmath61 .",

    ", we do not discuss the microforce balance and instead already use the form @xmath63 which could be derived in our context in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "however , in order to shorten the presentation we do not state the details .",
