    "adiabatic techniques are widely used for the manipulation of quantum states .",
    "they typically yield high fidelities and possess a high degree of robustness .",
    "one paradigmatic example is stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) in three - level atomic systems  @xcite .",
    "stirap - like techniques have been successfully applied to a wide range of problems , and in particular , to the control of the centre - of - mass states of atoms in microtraps .",
    "this spatial analogue of stirap is called spatial adiabatic passage ( sap ) and it relies on coupling different spatial eigenstates via a controllable tunnelling interaction  @xcite .",
    "it has been examined for cold atoms in optical traps  @xcite and for electrons trapped in quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "the ability to control the spatial degrees of freedom of trapped particles is an important goal for using these systems in future quantum technologies such as atomtronics  @xcite and quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "sap has also been suggested for a variety of tasks such as interferometry  @xcite , creating angular momentum  @xcite , and velocity filtering  @xcite .",
    "it is also applicable to the classical optics of coupled waveguides  @xcite .",
    "however , the high fidelity and robustness of adiabatic techniques comes at the expense of requiring long operation times .",
    "this is problematic as the system will therefore also have a long time to interact with an environment leading to losses or decoherence . to avoid this problem",
    ", we will show how one can speed - up processes that control the centre - of - mass state of quantum particles and introduce a new class of techniques which we refer to as spatial non - adiabatic passage ( snap ) . the underlying foundation for these are shortcuts to adiabaticity ( sta ) techniques , which have been developed to achieve high fidelities in much shorter total times , for a review see  @xcite .",
    "moreover , shortcuts are known to provide the freedom to optimise against undesirable effects such as noise , systematic errors or transitions to unwanted levels  @xcite .",
    "implementing the sta techniques for spatial control requires complex tunnelling frequencies .",
    "however , tunnelling frequencies are typically real . to solve this",
    ", we show that the application of a magnetic field to a triple well system containing a single charged particle ( which could correspond to a quantum dot system  @xcite ) can achieve complex tunnelling frequencies through the addition of a geometric phase .",
    "this then allows one to implement a counter - diabatic driving term  @xcite or , more generally , to design dynamics using lewis ",
    "riesenfeld invariants  @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we present the model we examine , namely a charged particle in a triple well ring system with a magnetic field in the centre . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sap ] , we introduce the spatial adiabatic passage technique in a three - level system and show that making one of the couplings imaginary allows the implementation of transitionless quantum driving .",
    "we then show , in sec .",
    "[ sec : lri ] , how to create inverse - engineering protocols in this system using lewis  riesenfeld invariants .",
    "results for two such protocols , namely transport and generation of a three - trap superposition , are given in sec .",

    "the basis states and the couplings strengths used in the three - level approximation are indicated .",
    "the coordinate system for the continuous model in sec .  [ sec:1dsim ] is also shown .",
    "the distance between two traps along the ring is defined as @xmath0 , so that the total circumference of the ring is @xmath1 . ]",
    "we consider a charged particle trapped in a system of three localised potentials , between which the tunnel coupling can be changed in a time - dependent manner .",
    "such a model could , for example , correspond to an electron trapped in an arrangement of quantum dots , where gate electrodes can be used to change the tunnelling between different traps  @xcite , or an ion trapped in an array of micro - surface traps  @xcite , where the distance between traps can be controlled . in order to have coupling between all traps ,",
    "they are assumed to be arranged along a ring and a magnetic field exists perpendicular to the plane containing the traps , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] . the particle will initially be located in one of the traps and we will show how to design snap protocols where a specific final state can be reached within a finite time and with high fidelity .    let us start by considering the single - particle schrdinger equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the mass and charge of the particle , respectively , and @xmath5 corresponds to the potential describing the trapping geometry .",
    "we assume that the vector potential is originating from an idealised point - like and infinitely long solenoid at the origin ( creating a magnetic flux @xmath6 ) and it is therefore given by @xmath7 ( for @xmath8 ) .",
    "here @xmath9 are cylindrical coordinates and @xmath10 is a unit vector in the @xmath11 direction .    at low energies such",
    "a system can be approximated by a three - level ( 3l ) model , where each basis state , @xmath12 , corresponds to the localised ground state in one of the trapping potentials ( see  fig .  [",
    "fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "these states are isolated when a high barrier between them exists , but when the barrier is lowered the tunnelling rate @xmath13 between states @xmath12 and @xmath14 becomes significant .",
    "the presence of the magnetic field leads to the particle acquiring an aharonov ",
    "bohm phase  @xcite whenever it moves ( tunnels ) between two different positions ( traps ) .",
    "this phase is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the position of the @xmath17-th trap , and for consistency , we always chose the direction of the path of the integration to be anti - clockwise around the pole of the vector potential ( at @xmath18 ) .",
    "the effects of this phase on the tunnelling rates is given through the peierls phase factors  @xcite , @xmath19 , and the hamiltonian for the 3l system can be written as @xmath20 here the @xmath13 are the coupling coefficients in the absence of any vector potential . the total phase around a closed path containing the three traps is then given by @xmath21 and is non - zero due to the pole of the vector potential @xmath22 at the origin .    to simplify the hamiltonian",
    "one can use the following unitary transformation , which only employs local phases , @xmath23 and transforms the hamiltonian as @xmath24 so that two of the tunnelling rates become real - valued .",
    "a case of particular interest is when @xmath25 , i.e. , when the magnetic flux is @xmath26 . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath27 where each @xmath28 is a spin 1 angular momentum operator defined as @xmath29 satisfying @xmath30 = i \\epsilon_{jkl } k_l$ ] and @xmath31 is the levi - civita symbol  @xcite .",
    "this means that the tunnel coupling between @xmath32 and @xmath33 becomes purely imaginary .",
    "we will show in the next section that this allows for the implementation of snap processes by either applying a transitionless quantum driving protocol or by using lewis  riesenfeld invariants .",
    "a series of spatial adiabatic passage ( sap ) techniques have been developed in recent years , which allows one to manipulate and control the external degrees of freedom of quantum particles in localised potentials with high fidelity  @xcite . the standard sap protocol for the transport of a single particle in a triple well system  @xcite is the spatial analogue of the quantum - optical stirap technique  @xcite .",
    "it involves three linearly arranged , degenerate trapping states , @xmath12 with @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , that can be coupled through tunnelling by either changing the distance between the traps or lowering the potential barrier between them .",
    "the system in the 3l approximation is described by the hamiltonian @xmath37 which has a zero - energy eigenstate of the form @xmath38 this state is often called the _ dark state _ and sap consists of adiabatically following @xmath39 from @xmath40 ( at @xmath41 ) to @xmath42 ( at a final time @xmath43 ) , effectively transporting the particle between the outer traps one and three .",
    "this corresponds to changing @xmath44 from @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) to @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "hence in the case of ideal adiabatic following , trap two ( located in the middle ) is never populated .",
    "the main drawback of sap is that it requires the process to be carried out adiabatically and therefore slowly compared to the energy gap  @xcite .",
    "if this requirement is not met , unwanted excitations will lead to imperfect transport .",
    "one way to specifically cancel possible diabatic transitions in stirap was discussed in  @xcite and a general approach for recovering adiabatic dynamics in a non - adiabatic regime is to use shortcuts to adiabaticity , such as transitionless quantum driving  @xcite .",
    "this technique consists of adding a counter - diabatic term to the original hamiltonian , whose particular form is given as @xmath49 where the @xmath50 are the eigenstates of @xmath51 .",
    "for the reference hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) this gives  @xcite @xmath52 we will see in sec .  [",
    "sec : trans ] how this exact same scheme can also be obtained using lewis  riesenfeld invariants .",
    "shortcuts to adiabaticity have been studied in the context of stirap  @xcite , i.e. , population transfer between internal levels .",
    "its spatial analogue is more challenging as it requires that the additional tunnelling coupling between sites one and three is imaginary ( see the definition of @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ksu2 ] ) ) . however , the system we have presented here is ideal for this , as the system hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : totalh ] ) is already equal to the total hamiltonian @xmath54 .",
    "other methods to implement the imaginary coupling could be , for example , the use of artificial magnetic fields  @xcite or angular momentum states  @xcite .    a heuristic but not rigorous explanation of why the coupling needs to be imaginary can be obtained by examining the two  paths \" the particle can take to move from trap one to trap three .",
    "the first is via sap and leads to @xmath55 whereas the second is via the direct coupling the shortcut introduces , which leads to @xmath56 .",
    "one can then immediately see that for constructive interference of these two terms the phase needs to have the value @xmath57 , which corresponds to the required imaginary coupling between states @xmath40 and @xmath58 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the coupling between traps one and three in the shortcut has the form of a @xmath59-pulse @xmath60 = \\pi .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      another method of designing shortcuts to adiabaticity is by means of inverse - engineering using lewis ",
    "riesenfeld ( lr ) invariants  @xcite . in this section",
    "we will briefly review these methods and then apply them to our particular system to both transport the particle and create a superposition between the three wells .",

    "hence a general solution to the schrdinger equation can be written as @xmath68 where the @xmath69 are independent of time .",
    "the idea behind inverse engineering using lr invariants is not to follow an instantaneous eigenstate of the @xmath61 as one would in the adiabatic case , but rather follow an eigenstate of @xmath62 ( up to the lr phase ) . to guarantee that the eigenstates coincide at the beginning and the end of the process , it is necessary that the invariant and the hamiltonian commute at these times , i.e. , @xmath70=\\left[i(t),h(t)\\right]=0.\\ ] ] one is then free to choose how the state evolves in the intermediate time and once this is fixed , eq .",

    "transport can be seen to occur with perfect fidelity for any value of the total time if the phase takes the appropriate value @xmath57 .",
    "it can also be seen that the shortcut is successful for any value of the phase in the limit of very short or very long times .",

    "while the 3l approximation discussed above gives a clear picture of the physics of the system , it does not include effects such as excitations to higher energy states that can occur during the process .",
    "we will therefore in the following test the approximation by numerically integrating the full schrdinger equation in real space . for this",
    ", we will consider traps that are narrow enough to limit the system dynamics to an effectively one - dimensional setting along the azimuthal coordinate , @xmath110 , i.e. , around a circle of radius @xmath111 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] .",
    "moreover , we will assume that the magnetic field is characterised by a vector potential in the azimuthal direction , @xmath112 .",
    "we are therefore dealing with a one - dimensional system of length @xmath113 with periodic boundary conditions , whose dynamics are described by the following schrdinger equation @xmath114 we assume a constant vector potential throughout the dynamical part of the protocols , as any time - varying vector potential would produce an unwanted force due to the electric field @xmath115 .    in order to be able to apply a well - defined phase we model the trapping sites as highly localised point - like potentials of depth @xmath116 at the positions @xmath117 ( see fig .

    "<S> quantum technologies based on adiabatic techniques can be highly effective , but often at the cost of being very slow . here </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a set of experimentally realistic , non - adiabatic protocols for spatial state preparation , which yield the same fidelity as their adiabatic counterparts , but on fast timescales . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we consider a charged particle in a system of tunnel - coupled quantum wells , where the presence of a magnetic field can induce a geometric phase during the tunnelling processes . we show that this leads to the appearance of complex tunnelling frequencies and allows for the implementation of spatial non - adiabatic passage . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the ability of such a system to transport a particle between two different wells and to generate a delocalised superposition between the three traps with high fidelity in short times . </S>"
