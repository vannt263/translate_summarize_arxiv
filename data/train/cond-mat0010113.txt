    "recent studies of josephson plasma resonance ( jpr ) absorption in highly anisotropic layered high - temperature and organic superconductors have proved that this tool provides unique information on josephson coupling of layers and on the structure of vortex phases in the presence of an applied magnetic field .",

    "( [ omega0 ] ) is valid as well , if the jpr frequency is well below the scattering rate of quasiparticles , because under this condition only the cooper pairs contribute to plasma oscillations @xcite .",
    "then , the jpr frequency drops with temperature proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "this allows one to observe resonance absorption as a function of temperature at a fixed frequency of uniform microwave electric field oriented along the _ c _ axis @xcite .",
    "recently the jpr frequency @xmath16 was also measured by sweeping frequency @xcite and the value @xmath17 ghz was obtained for slightly underdoped bi-2212 .",

    "a dc magnetic field applied along the _ c _ axis , penetrates inside the superconductor in the form of pancake vortices @xcite . in an ideal material at low temperatures pancakes would form straight lines and have no influence on interlayer coupling .",
    "due to very weak coupling , pinning and thermal fluctuations easily misalign pancakes in different layers , which leads to suppression of effective josephson coupling @xcite and , as a consequence , to reduction of the josephson plasma resonance frequency @xcite .",
    "in real materials pancakes in neighboring layers are always misaligned due to pinning in the vortex glass phase ( below the irreversibility line ) and due to thermal disorder in the vortex liquid phase .",
    "misaligned pancakes induce a gauge - invariant phase difference @xmath22 between neighboring layers @xmath23 and @xmath24 which causes suppression of the jpr frequency according to the relation @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 means thermal average and average over disorder caused by pinning centers .",

    "we will calculate @xmath91 and express @xmath92 via the correlation function of vortex density in the system without josephson coupling .",
    "we show that , at temperatures above the melting point , the coupling between two dimensional pancake liquids in different layers is very weak and can be neglected . if , in addition , pinning inside the layers is neglected , then the density correlation function coincides with the density correlation function of the two - dimensional one - component coulomb plasma @xcite .",

    "<S> josephson plasma resonance has been introduced recently as a powerful tool to probe interlayer josephson coupling in different regions of the vortex phase diagram in layered superconductors . in the liquid phase , </S>",
    "<S> the high temperature expansion with respect to the josephson coupling connects the josephson plasma frequency with the phase correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> this function , in turn , is directly related to the pair distribution function of the liquid . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a recipe to extract the phase and density correlation functions from the dependencies of the plasma resonance frequency @xmath0 and the @xmath1 axis conductivity @xmath2 on the _ ab_-component of the magnetic field at fixed _ c _ -component . using langevin dynamic simulations of two - dimensional vortex arrays we calculate density and phase correlation functions at different temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> calculated phase correlations describe very well the experimental angular dependence of the plasma resonance field . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that in the case of weak damping in the liquid phase , broadening of the jpr line is caused mainly by random josephson coupling arising from the density fluctuations of pancake vortices . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the jpr line has a universal shape , which is determined only by parameters of the superconductors and temperature . </S>"
