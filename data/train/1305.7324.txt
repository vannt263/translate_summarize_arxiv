    "among the different techniques which allow the nuclear spin polarization to be enhanced to almost its maximum theoretical value , dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp ) is raising in popularity .",
    "the method is flexible enough to be applied to a variety of molecules of biological interest that in recent years has catalyzed dramatic advances for _ in vivo _",
    "@xmath0c magnetic resonance imaging ( see the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "dnp increases the nuclear steady state polarization through a transfer of spin order between the electron and the nuclear spin systems , occurring when the electron spin resonance ( esr ) line is suitably irradiated . for biomedical imaging purposes",
    "this transfer takes place among the electrons of stable radicals and the nuclei of biomolecules , in a solution which is cooled to @xmath1 k. once the nuclear polarization process has taken place , the frozen solution is rapidly dissolved ( while maintaining most of the spin order just created @xcite ) and injected into living subjects to eventually image the metabolic fate of the hyperpolarized substrates _ in vivo_.    in parallel to the development of these novel biomedical applications , a renewed commitment towards the understanding of the physical mechanisms driving dnp is emerging . the basic physical concepts underlying dnp phenomenology , have already been described few decades ago ( see @xcite and reference therein ) and three different regimes , the solid effect , the cross effect and the thermal mixing ( tm ) regime , were specified according to the typical parameters of the system , such as the nuclear resonance frequency , the strength of the interaction between the spins and the magnitude of the external magnetic field .",
    "considerable steps forward have recently been made in the quantum mechanical description of solid effect @xcite and cross effect @xcite .",
    "the relevant regime for biomedical application , however , has been argued to be the tm regime @xcite , with a dipolar interaction among the electron spins which is stronger than their coupling with the lattice , although very small with respect to the @xmath2-anisotropy terms responsible for the broadening of the electron resonance line .",
    "the traditional approach to the tm regime is based on an effective thermodynamic model ( the so - called spin temperature approach ) : such description , while providing a qualitative picture of the expected steady state polarization under microwave saturation , does not include any dependence on the strength of the interactions between nuclear and electron spins , as well as on the relative intensities between those interactions , the spin - lattice relaxation rates and the microwave irradiation power .",
    "improvements to the original theoretical picture have been proposed in @xcite and @xcite . in these latter papers , in particular , a novel approach based on rate equations has been introduced , that overcomes several limitations of the traditional approaches and provides the dynamics of the spin polarization of spin ensembles by calculating the evolution induced by any single or multiple spin transitions .",
    "there are however certain experimental observations ( see appendix [ review ] for details ) pointing out a complexity of the dnp phenomenon that remains largely unexplained .",
    "the typical dnp formulations that guarantee an adequate polarization level for _ in vivo _ procedures are normally obtained using relatively low concentration of trityl radicals ( between 10 and 20 mm ) , but no exhaustive explanation of why a higher concentration of electron spins causes a reduction of the final nuclear polarization was given so far .",
    "moreover , according the observation first reported in @xcite , trace amounts ( 1 - 2 mm ) of gadolinium complexes added to the solutions can further improve the dnp signal enhancement .",
    "the addition of gadolinium , now commonly exploited in standard protocols for dnp sample preparation @xcite , was shown to affect neither the electron linewidth nor the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation time , while it induces a significant reduction of the electron spin relaxation time @xmath3 @xcite . in the borghini s framework , however , such reduction would affect the nuclear polarization by less than 10 % @xcite , whereas the gadolinium - induced enhancement observed experimentally is up to four - fold .",
    "in this paper we first integrate the available experimental scenario with new data , collected on a prototype sample ( section [ nconc ] ) , showing how the final value of the nuclear polarization does not depend on the concentration of nuclear spins .",
    "inspired by such observation , in section [ theoreticalmodel ] we introduce a variant of the rate equation approach proposed in @xcite , which includes a dissipative term within the electron system controlled by the radical concentration .",
    "the numerical predictions of this novel model , reported in section [ numericalresults ] , reproduce rather well the experimental behaviour of the nuclear polarization _ versus _ electron spin density as well as its extreme sensitivity to the reduction of @xmath3 .",
    "these and other aspects of the comparison between theoretical and experimental results ( these latter recalled in appendix [ review ] ) are discussed in more detail in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "all technical details of the model computation have been included in appendix [ appa ] and [ appc ] , to better highlight the main messages of this work .",

    "thus , an improved tm theory should rely onto different dissipative scenario . in order to clarify whether these mechanisms involve primarily the electron or the nuclear spin reservoir , we have experimentally investigated the modifications of @xmath11 in pyruvic acid samples doped with ox063 trityl radical @xmath12 mm at variable @xmath0c concentration .    to keep all the other properties of the solution unchanged ,",
    "samples with different @xmath0c concentrations were obtained by mixing unlabeled pyruvic acid and [ 1-@xmath0c]pyruvic acid in different ratios ( 100 % labeled sample , corresponding to 14.2 m @xmath0c concentration ; 75% labeled , 10.6 m ; 50 % , 7.1 m ; 25% labeled , 3.55 m ; 10 % labeled , 1.42 m ; unlabeled sample , corresponding to 0.43 m @xmath0c concentration ) . the carbon nuclear system of the unlabelled product",

    "@xmath0c polarization measurements were performed using two different apparati operating at about the same magnetic field @xmath16 but with different capabilities of temperature - regulation , to check whether or not the information we look for is temperature dependent .",
    "the first dnp system operates at @xmath4 t / @xmath5 k and is equipped with a @xmath17-@xmath18 mw microwave ( mw ) source that can be sweeped between @xmath19 and @xmath20 ghz and with a @xmath21 mhz radiofrequency ( rf ) set up .",
    "the second one works at variable temperature in the @xmath22-@xmath23 k range and uses a 32 mw gunn diode mw source working in the range @xmath24-@xmath25 ghz and a @xmath26 mhz rf probe .",
    "an amount of about 100 mg of each sample underwent flash freezing in a cryogenic bath before starting mw irradiation operating at the frequency corresponding at the maximum enhancement .",
    "the @xmath0c nmr signal build up was sampled after rf saturation ( in order to destroy any residual signal ) up to steady state by means of low flip angle ( @xmath27 about 6 @xmath28 ) acquisitions @xcite . @xmath11 and the polarization time constant @xmath29 were derived by fitting the build up curves to an expression that takes into account the reduction of the @xmath0c signal amplitude with time induced by the readout pulses according to ref .",
    "@xcite .    for low @xmath0c concentrations the evolution of the nuclear polarization turned out to be very slow ( at @xmath30 k @xmath31 s for the sample at natural abundance _ vs _",
    "s for the fully labelled sample ) , reflecting a degradation of the electron - nucleus contact on increasing the average distance between the two spin species and a slow nuclear spin diffusion .",
    "however , at all the investigated temperatures the final value of @xmath11 was found to be nearly independent from the @xmath0c concentration [ @xmath0c ] (  [ nuclei ] ) , similarly to what was reported also for other samples polarized by means of nitroxides radicals @xcite .",
    "this suggests that @xmath11 is substantially unaffected by nuclear relaxation mechanisms that do not involve the electron reservoir .",
    "in fact , as remarked in @xcite , in presence of a sizeable direct exchange between the nuclear system and the lattice , one would expect a substantial reduction of @xmath11 on decreasing the electron - nucleus contact .",
    "thus , it is concluded that the reduction of @xmath11 should primarly originate from dissipative processes involving the electron spins .",
    "which represents the nuclear relaxation processes not mediated by electrons .",

    "it is useful to split the electron population into spin packets sharing the same larmor frequency .",
    "the sum of these packets yields the esr line . at a given frequency",

    "the electron spin system moves from boltzman equilibrium to a non - equilibrium non - uniform steady state , characterized by a frequency - dependent profile @xmath49 $ ] ( with @xmath50 according to the spin temperature approach ) , which is responsible for the enhancement of the nuclear polarization @xmath51 .",
    "a pictorial description of this phenomenon and on the three different subsystems involved is sketched  [ figuresystem ] .",
    "in general , the computation of the steady state electron inverse temperature @xmath52 is a rather diffcult task since the electron spins , which are strongly interacting with each other _ via _ dipolar coupling , are out of equilibrium due to mw irradiation and are at the same time in contact with a thermal bath ( lattice ) . under certain assumptions ,",
    "discussed in detail below , borghini @xcite was able to compute @xmath53 and , accordingly , its corresponding inverse temperature @xmath54 , and to provide an upper bound for @xmath11 .",
    "his overestimation is particularly evident when mw irradiation is performed at the edges of the esr line where one would expect to observe an almost negligible polarization enhancement . in previous works",
    "@xcite we showed that a finite electron nucleus contact , even in the mean field approximation , allows to recover realistic values of the nuclear spin polarization . in that model",
    "the finite electron - nucleus contact combines both the iss processes ( a simultaneous flip - flop of two electron spins compensated by a nuclear spin flip ) and the nuclear spin diffusion .",
    "nuclei reach an intermediate inverse spin temperature between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , corresponding to a reduced @xmath11 , and determined by the ratio between the electron - nucleus contact ( quantified by @xmath33 ) and the nuclear leakage ( @xmath9 ) . by properly tuning the values of these parameters , one reproduces mw spectra similar to those observed in experiments",
    ". however , according to such a model one would expect @xmath33 to increase both with the nuclear and with the electron spin concentration that , by improving the contact among the two spin systems , would reduce the relative efficiency of the leakage , leading to higher steady state polarization levels .",
    "since this does not correspond to the behaviour observed experimentally ( see also section [ nconc ] ) , it becomes necessary to go beyond the profile @xmath53 proposed by borghini and search for different electron steady states , characterized by an inverse temperature @xmath52 smaller than @xmath56 and dependent on the electron spin density .",
    "first of all , it has to be realized that the borghini model and the model introduced in @xcite rely on the assumption that the energy exchange between the electron system and the lattice occurs only _ via _ the zeeman transitions depicted in  [ figuretransition ] , panel c , whereas all transitions involving more than one electron spin are always energy conserving .",
    "the simplest microscopic process of this kind , characterized by a time - scale @xmath34 , .",
    "this in order to better distinguish the microscopic events ( @xmath34 ) partially responsible for the energy exchange between different electron spins from the collective time ( usually reported as @xmath57 ) that describes the spin - spin relaxation from a thermodynamic point of view . ]",
    "is depicted in  [ figuretransition ] , panel a. transitions involving more than one spin are the elementary events of the phenomenon referred to as spectral diffusion in the low temperature tm - dnp description proposed in @xcite and here named energy conserving spectral diffusion ( csd ) . when csd is infinitely efficient ( @xmath58 ) , the electron system is driven towards a high inverse temperature @xmath56 .",
    "in this manuscript we consider an alternative model based on three main realistic assumptions .",
    "_ first _ , the energy conserving spectral diffusion is not , as it was always assumed so far in the tm models , infinitely fast ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "_ second _ , non conserving electron flip - flop processes ( characterized by a time constant @xmath36 ) are possible .",
    "the energy required for the electron flip flop in a dsd event must be provided or adsorbed by the lattice thermal bath . the most elementary non conserving transition",
    "is represented in  [ figuretransition ] , panel b. these latter events , analogously to @xmath34 processes , promote an internal thermalization among the different spin packets of the esr line and for this reason we refer to their macroscopic effect as _ dissipative _ spectral diffusion ( dsd ) . since at t approx . 1 k the lattice is lacking in its capabilities of emitting energy quanta ( even if at very low frequency ) that can stimulate spin transitions , we expect @xmath36 to be much longer than @xmath34 , the latter not requiring any energy exchange of the electron spin system with the lattice .",
    "third _ assumption originates from the experimental results reported in the previous section , which clearly show that when trityls are exploited as polarizing agents for @xmath0c nuclei , the electron - nucleus contact @xmath60 and the nuclear leakage @xmath61 are weak enough to make any electron polarization loss _ via _ the nuclear channel irrelevant in defining the final steady state of electrons . in this limit @xmath53",
    "is determined only by the competition between energy conserving and non conserving processes and can be derived , upon considering the electron spins as a fully connected system , by solving a system of mean field rate equations ( appendix [ appa ] ) describing the three processes in  [ figuretransition ] . once @xmath53 is known , the corresponding nuclear polarization @xmath11 is derived as described in @xcite ( see eq.(9 ) ) through the following expression :    @xmath62 d \\omega}{\\int f(\\omega ) f(\\omega + \\omega_n ) \\left [ 1- p_e^{\\infty}(\\omega ) p_e^{\\infty}(\\omega + \\omega_n)\\right ] d\\omega } .",
    "\\label{eqpn*}\\ ] ]    it is worth to remark that the first assumption of the model ( _ i.e. _ finite @xmath34 ) defines a regime which is not a pure tm ( _ i.e. _ the electron profile is in general not a simple hyperbolic tangent function with a defined spin temperature @xmath63 ) . in the numerical calculations that follows however ,",
    "the interactions between electrons are generally assumed to be strong enough to impose an electron profile which is significantly different form the equilibrium condition . by increasing @xmath34 and @xmath36",

    "one immediately recognizes that the assumption of a non zero , although very small , value of @xmath78 leads to a clipping of the wings of the nuclear polarization spectrum and thus to the overtaking of the most evident limitation of the borghini model that was encountered also in the high temperature tm limit first discussed by provotorov @xcite .",
    "a similar improvement is achievable also by assuming a combination of bad electron - nucleus contact and finite nuclear leakage @xcite or by imposing a partial saturation of the irradiated packet @xcite . here",
    "however it is obtained simply by removing the non - physical assumption @xmath58 , which is normally accepted in all tm models in order to simplify their computation . as expected , the second new element of the proposed model ( electron electron flip - flop ) , acts as a source of dissipation within the electron system , producing an overall suppression of the final nuclear polarization .",
    "also in this case a @xmath59 is mandatory to obtain a sharper and realistic shape of the @xmath11 spectrum .    in order to analyze the time evolution of the electron profile @xmath79 , as obtained by the system of rate equations ( [ rateeqt2e ] ) , it is convenient to introduce a scalar parameter @xmath80 computed from @xmath79 through the following equation :    @xmath81 d \\omega}{\\int f(\\omega ) f(\\omega + \\omega_n ) \\left [ 1- p_e(\\omega , t ) p_e(\\omega + \\omega_n , t)\\right ] d\\omega } . \\label{eqq}\\ ] ]    as far as the electron - lattice coupling ( @xmath82 ) is widely more efficient than the electron - nucleus contact ( @xmath60 ) , @xmath80 represents the nuclear polarization that would be associated to the electron profile @xmath79 if this latter was a steady state profile.it is important to realize that @xmath80 and @xmath83 have rather different build up times , being the latter dependent on @xmath33 , and converge to the same value only for @xmath84 .    when @xmath85 the electron profile under mw irradiation at frequency @xmath86 progresses from hole burning ( where the irradiated packet is saturated and all other packets are at boltzman equilibrium ) to a profile which approaches , in the limit @xmath87 , the one predicted by borghini ( @xmath88 $ ] ) .",
    "in the example depicted in  [ figure1nr ] in particular , the system is shown to evolve from @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",
    "when @xmath36 is finite and the electron spin - lattice relaxation is negligible ( @xmath91 ) , the system starts to evolve from the hole burning profile ( @xmath89 ) to larger @xmath92 values up to @xmath93 , when the dissipative process becomes relevant and the saturation of the burned spin packet slowly spreads throughout the esr spectrum ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "this catastrophic fate is prevented by the onset of electron spin lattice relaxation which freezes the electron profile for @xmath95 . in summary two time - regimes",
    "can be identified :    * @xmath96 , where csd processes dominate and increase the nuclear polarization ;",
    "* @xmath97 , where dsd processes are effective and reduce @xmath11 .",
    "both the reduction of @xmath11 observed when increasing the radical concentration and the polarization enhancement following gadolinium doping find a natural explanation within this general framework . by shortening @xmath36 and @xmath34 without significantly affecting @xmath3",
    ", a large number of paramagnetic centers decreases the nuclear polarization . on the other hand , any perturbation that solely reduces @xmath3 leaving the spectral diffusion parameters unchanged ( as gadolinimu doping",
    "is expected to do ) , has a positive outcome on @xmath11 .",
    "an increase of the electron concentration @xmath98 is expected to lead to an enhancement of the transition rates @xmath75 and @xmath76 that depend on the mutual distances between electrons . in our simulations",
    "the two parameters were phenomenologically assumed to scale with @xmath99 . beside allowing to nicely reproducing the observed experimental behavior ,",
    "this choice for @xmath76 was inspired by the @xmath99 dependence reported by abragam and goldman in reference @xcite , eq .",
    "( 6.50 ) , for the @xmath100 process .",
    "the two mechanisms are in fact analogous from the electron point of view ( both involving a flip flop event between two electrons ) , being only differentiated by the partner for energy exchange : the nuclear system for iss and the lattice for dsd . the choice of the same scaling function for @xmath76 does not have instead any _ a priori _ justification , but it has been checked to not significantly affect the @xmath98 dependence of @xmath11 as far as @xmath101 .",
    "numerical results , obtained by setting @xmath102 s according to @xcite and by adapting @xmath34 and @xmath36 to fit the experimental value @xmath11 of given samples at @xmath12 mm trityl concentration , are shown in  [ figureapsimul ] to properly model the experimental behaviour found in [ 1-@xmath0c]pyruvic acid and [ @xmath0c]urea samples described in appendix [ review ] ,  [ figureap ] .",
    "the decrease of @xmath11 observed at high radical concentration for both systems (  [ figureapsimul ] , panel b ) is due to the higher efficiency of dsd processes in the regime where they are predominant .",
    "conversely , the small increase observed for the [ 1-@xmath0c]pyruvic acid sample at low radical concentration corresponds to the regime where csd dominates . at",
    "very low concentration the polarization shows the correct qualitative behavior but its absolute value is slightly higher than what was found in experiments .",
    "a possible explanation is that our approach assumes , for the limit of vanishing electron concentration , an hole burning shape which corresponds to a pretty high value of @xmath11 .",
    "this assumption is quite crude because the hole burning shape is not realistic even when the electron packets are not interacting .    finally ,",
    "when the whole mw spectra at two different radical concentration are considered (  [ figureapsimul ] , panel a ) , a shift of the maximum enhancement position towards the edge of the spectrum , when increasing _ c _ , is observed ( peak to peak distance = 65 mhz for the 15 mm sample and 90 mhz for the 45 mm sample ) . since to our knowledge no experimental evidence of such behavior",

    "the effect of doping the dnp samples with moderate quantities of gadolinium complexes has been modeled by considering the @xmath3 reduction that , according to literature data @xcite , follows such doping . for numerical simulations a high ( although finite ) csd rate has been set ( @xmath71 s ) , whereas the spin lattice relaxation was taken from literature @xcite ( @xmath102 s in absence of gadolinium ) .",
    "@xmath36 was adapted to suitable reproducing @xmath11 mw spectra without gadolinium .",
    "the two major effects of reducing @xmath3 are shown in  [ figuregdsimul ] , panel a : ( _ i _ ) the overall nuclear polarization is enhanced ; ( _ ii _ ) the peaks position is shifted towards the centre of the spectrum . the quantitative agreement between the simulated mw spectra and their experimental counterpart reproduced in  [ figuregd ] ( in particular the 4-fold enhancement ) is remarkable .",
    "the behaviour of the maximum @xmath11 as a function of @xmath103 is represented in panel b.    two regimes can be recognized : for relatively small reduction of @xmath3 ( low gadolinium concentration ) the nuclear polarization is enhanced since such a reduction leads to a suppression of the dissipative effect induced by @xmath36 processes ; for more significant @xmath3 reductions ( higher gadolinium concentration ) @xmath11 decreases and slowly reaches the value correspondent to the hole burning profile .",
    "no assumption was made regarding the specific dependence of @xmath3 on gadolinium concentration , since the available experimental data do not allow to establish a clear functional relation between the two parameters .",
    "it can not be excluded _ a priori _ that the presence of gadolinium affects also other interaction parameters , such as @xmath36 , and not only @xmath3 .",
    "the only strong experimental observation available on the effect of gadolinium doping , however , is a significant reduction of @xmath3 , that we proved here to be sufficient to account for the correspondent polarization enhancement as well as for the modification of the microwave dnp spectrum .",
    "the aim of this work was to find a suitable theoretical justification for the effects of radical concentration and gadolinium doping on the ultimate performances of a dnp procedure carried out a @xmath104 k with trityl radicals .",
    "the available experimental data show that @xmath11 decreases at high trityl concentration and increases after addition of moderate amounts of gadolinium complexes .",
    "the @xmath11 reduction on increasing the number of paramagnetic centers is associated with a faster polarization build up .",
    "while a speed up of the dnp process with the increase in the radical concentration has to be expected , since there are more polarization transfer centers , the significant decrease of the steady state polarization has not been accounted for by any previous theoretical description of tm - dnp .",
    "in fact both the borghini @xcite and the finite contact model introduced in @xcite and @xcite predict no effect of the radical concentration as long as @xmath9 is negligible whereas , in presence of leakage , a higher number of polarizing centres would push the system towards higher steady state polarizations .",
    "gadolinium doping on the other hand leaves substantially unaffected the nuclear polarization time , while shortening the typical electron spin lattice relaxation time @xmath3 . in the borghini s framework such a reduction is expected to induce an enhancement of @xmath11 , that however , as already remarked in @xcite , can not justify quantitatively those sizeable enhancements reported in the same paper and later on in @xcite . to complete the experimental picture we measured the dependence of @xmath11 on nuclear concentration by varying the labelling percentage on a [ 1-@xmath0c]pyruvic acid sample added with trityl radicals 15 mm .",
    "even if at low nuclear concentration the polarization time becomes very long , the final value of @xmath105 remains almost constant .",
    "the main messages emerging from this collection of literature and experimental observations can be summarized as follows .",
    "* the nuclear spin system does not affect the evolution of the electron profile , acting only as a passive viewer of the electron system . *",
    "the transition rate of many particle processes ( involving nuclear and electron spins ) increases with the radical concentration . *",
    "the addition of gadolinium complexes to the dnp preparation leads to a reduction of electron spin - lattice relaxation and to an enhancement of the steady state nuclear polarization .    guided by these three items we introduced a novel model , based on the same rate equations approach proposed in @xcite under the assumption of bad electron - nucleus contact and negligible nuclear leakage , but including an additional mechanism accounting for energy exchanges between couples of electron spins ( that flip simultaneusly ) and the lattice .",
    "it is worth to mention that similar flip - flop processes were already introduced by farrar _",
    "@xcite in a high temperature approximation of tm - dnp in presence of inhomogeneusly broadened esr lines . here",
    "we implement them within a theoretical picture where conservative spectral diffusion terms are also active and no linearization of the electron and nuclear polarization has been applied .",
    "when both the conservative and non - conservative flip - flop rates @xmath75 and @xmath76 are phenomenologically assumed to scale with @xmath99 , our model is able to reproduce fairly well the experimental behaviour of @xmath11 on increasing the density of paramagnetic centers ( see  [ figureapsimul ] _ versus _  [ figureap ] ) .",
    "a quantum mechanical derivation of the two rates , and in turn of their @xmath98-dependence , would be desirable and certainly deserve additional future work to provide a more rigorous treatment . however , it has been checked that even if other ( positive ) @xmath98-dependences of the flip - flop rates are assumed , the qualitative outcome of this analysis remains unchanged , although the agreement between experimental and simulated data get worse .",
    "the implementation of the dsd , makes the model also much more sensitive to @xmath82 variations , providing a suitable key of interpretation for the influence of gadolinium doping on nuclear polarization enhancement ( see  [ figuregdsimul ] _ versus _  [ figuregd ] ) .",

    "here we went over some of the assumptions limiting the theoretical analysis of the cited authors .",
    "in particular we avoided the use of the provotorov approximation , which displays an unphysical overestimation of @xmath105 at the edges of the mw spectrum , and we extended our investigation beyond the the regime dominated by dissipative processes , where the final nuclear polarization depends monotonically on gadolinium concentration , definitely resulting in a more extensive description of the experimental scenario .    in conclusion",
    "we have presented a theoretical model providing a broad and unified understanding of different features observed in low temperature @xmath0c dnp experiments based on the use of trityls ( or narrow linewidth radicals as polarizing agents ) .",
    "the validity of the model is limited to those cases where the radical concentration is high enough for tm to dominate over other polarization mechanisms such as the solid effect , and to make the polarization build up time fast with respect to nuclear leakage processes .",
    "moreover the model is not expected to suitably describe systems characterized by broad esr lines , where also protons are involved in the tm mechanism ( as in nitroxides ) . in that case ( that will object of future studies ) the electron - nucleus contact and the nuclear leakage are likely to be strong enough to be involved in the evolution of the electron profile .",

    "are summarized .",
    "a comparison between the microwave spectra with and without gadolinium is shown in panel a. the addition of gadolinium leads to two main outcomes , a reduced separation between the positive and the negative polarization peaks and a nearly linear increase of @xmath11 as the concentration of the rare earth [ gd ] goes from @xmath17 to @xmath117 mm . by further increasing [ gd ] , the steady state polarization first reaches a plateau and then declines for [ gd ] @xmath120 mm .",

    "similar results hold for bdpa radicals , whereas much less pronounced effects were observed when nitroxides are used for polarizing the sample .",
    "it is worth to notice that both carbon and hydrogen nuclei are involved in tm - dnp of samples prepared with nitroxides ; this introduces a further degree of freedom in the problem , pushing it outside the field of validity of the theoretical model presented in the section [ theoreticalmodel ] .",
    "in order to simulate the time evolution of the electron polarization profile , the same approach proposed in @xcite has been used .",
    "the esr line was modeled by a gaussian function truncated at @xmath122 , with @xmath123 mhz to reproduce the behaviour of trityl based dnp samples @xcite , and split into @xmath124 electron packets of width @xmath125 mhz , characterized by a polarization @xmath126 ( indicated here with @xmath127 ) , with @xmath128 .",
    "we have checked that our results do not change on increasing the number of packets and thus can be considered as a fair approximation of the continuum limit .",
    "the mw irradiation was assumed to be strong enough to saturate a given packet @xmath129 , voiding its polarization .",

    "<S> the available theoretical approaches aiming at describing dynamic nuclear spin polarization ( dnp ) in solutions containing molecules of biomedical interest and paramagnetic centers are not able to model the behaviour observed upon varying the concentration of trityl radicals or the polarization enhancement caused by moderate addition of gadolinium complexes . in this manuscript </S>",
    "<S> , we first show experimentally that the nuclear steady state polarization reached in solutions of pyruvic acid with 15 mm trityl radicals is substantially independent from the average internuclear distance . </S>",
    "<S> this evidences a leading role of electron ( over nuclear ) spin relaxation processes in determining the ultimate performances of dnp . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , we have devised a variant of the thermal mixing model for inhomogenously broadened electron resonance lines which includes a relaxation term describing the exchange of magnetic anisotropy energy of the electron spin system with the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to this additional term , the dependence of the nuclear polarization on the electron concentration can be properly accounted for . moreover , </S>",
