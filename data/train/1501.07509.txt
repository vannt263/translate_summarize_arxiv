    "the key concept is that of an @xmath11graph corresponding to graphs for which each vertex has out - degree @xmath12 . as it turns out , these are exactly the graphs for which the @xmath13limit sets of the associated semiflow are nonempty . to each graph @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the set of vertices , @xmath16 the power set of @xmath15 , and @xmath17 the set of edges , we associate a semiflow @xmath18 .",
    "this semiflow is studied from the point of view of qualitative behavior of dynamical systems .",
    "we adapt the concepts of @xmath13limit sets , ( positive ) invariance , recurrence , morse decompositions , attractors and attractor - repeller pairs to @xmath19 and prove characterizations equivalent to those in @xcite .",
    "as it turns out , the finest morse decomposition of the semiflow @xmath19 corresponds to the decomposition of @xmath20 into the communicating classes @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , the order on the communicating classes is equivalent to the order that accompanies a morse decomposition .",
    "moreover , the connected components of the recurrent set of @xmath19 are exactly the ( finest ) morse sets of @xmath19 , i.e. , the communicating classes of @xmath20 .    graphs @xmath14 ( and certain aspects of markov chains ) are often studied using the adjacency matrix @xmath22 .",
    "the products of @xmath22 describe the paths , and hence the communication structure of @xmath20 .",

    "this point of view is somewhat different from the standard approach that uses regular matrix multiplication and that does not lead to an equivalent semiflow .",
    "the equivalence allows us to interpret all results obtained for @xmath19 in terms of certain linear iterated function systems .",
    "we subsequently apply the results obtained for graphs and their semiflows to the study of general finite markov chains .",
    "our results are presented in the form of a `` 3-language dictionary '' : each key concept for markov chains is `` translated '' into graph language and into semiflow language .",
    "this dictionary is contained in facts 1 - 13 and fact 15 .",
    "note that our concepts and results in terms of global dynamics only deal with the communication structure of graphs ( or the qualitative behavior of semiflows ) and hence they do not contain the probabilistic information of a markov chain .",
    "but , it turns out that a simple result on the geometric decay of certain probabilities ( lemma [ leaking ] ) is sufficient to recapture all the relevant probabilistic information . facts",
    "14 and 16 - 18 describe the long term behavior of general markov chains and introduce the concept of multistable states .",
    "our presentation unifies many related concepts concepts and shows which structural ( deterministic , graph theoretic , semiflow ) properties and which probabilistic properties are really needed to analyze markov chains .",
    "recall that a hybrid system is a dynamical system exhibiting the interaction between discrete and continuous phenomena . in this work we lay the foundation for a dynamical systems approach to hybrid systems with markov chain type perturbations .",
    "we start by presenting basic definitions and notations used along this work .",
    "our first goal is to produce two simple graph decompositions motivated by concepts form dynamical systems .",
    "in contrast to the standard convention , throughout this work , the _ vertex communication is not in necessarily an equivalence relation_. this simple observation will lead to interesting phenomena .",
    "we define communicating sets and classes , and a partial order between communicating classes is presented .",
