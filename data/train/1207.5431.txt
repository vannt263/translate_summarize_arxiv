    "the idea of holography arose in gravitational physics from the expression for the entropy of black holes @xcite s_bek = a4 g [ one ] since the entropy is given by the surface area measured in units of @xmath0 , it appeared plausible that there is ` one bit of data per planck area of the horizon ' .",
    "because the degrees of freedom are given by the bounding area rather than the ` volume ' of the hole , we use the term ` holographic ' to characterize the gravitational physics of the hole .    in recent years",
    "the term ` holography ' has been applied to the idea of gauge / gravity duality in ads spacetimes @xcite .",
    "this idea is depicted in fig.[fa1](a ) .",
    "the dashed line is an arbitrary boundary surface @xmath1 .",
    "a field theory on @xmath1 describes the gravitational physics of the entire region below @xmath1 .",
    "again , it appears that physics is ` holographic ' .",
    ".5 in can be avoided by moving to global ads , where a 3-point function is computed by a simple path integral with no singularities .",
    "( c ) if we have enough energy in global ads , we make a black hole , and then we face the difficulties of hawking s argument again .",
    "( the vertical direction is time , and the surface of the inner cylinder is the black hole horizon.),title=\"fig : \" ]    since the idea of gauge / gravity duality arose from studies of black holes in string theory , it is often assumed that these two uses of the term ` holographic ' are the same . stretching this further",
    ", one may think that the idea of gauge / gravity duality would somehow explain the mysteries associated with the entropy ( [ one ] ) and the related problem of the information paradox @xcite .",
    "but as we now note , there are several differences between the above two notions of holography :    \\(i ) for the black hole , the location of the boundary surface ( the horizon ) is fixed at @xmath2 . in gauge / gravity duality , the boundary surface can be placed anywhere in the ads region .",
    "\\(ii ) for the black hole , the area of the boundary surface gives the entropy ( [ one ] ) of the interior .",
    "but in gauge / gravity duality there is no such relation between the area of the boundary and the entropy contained inside .",
    "such relation .",
    "the entropy of the interior spacetime depends on how much energy @xmath3 we put in it . in particular",
    "if we take @xmath4 , we get empty ads with entropy @xmath5 .",
    "as we probe these differences more deeply , we will uncover important aspects of gravitational degrees of freedom and of the structure of spacetime itself .",
    "a fundamental problem in black hole physics is the information paradox @xcite . in a geometry with horizon , there is no time - independent foliation of spacetime . as shown in fig.[ftwo ] , spacelike slices are @xmath6 outside the horizon , but @xmath7 inside . `",
    "later ' slices are obtained by ` stretching ' the @xmath7 part of the slice ; this stretching creates particle pairs , with one member being inside the horizon and one outside .",
    "the important aspect of this particle creation process is that the two members of the pair are in an _ entangled _ state , which we may write schematically as |_pair=1 ( |0_in|0_out+|1_in|1_out ) [ three ] where @xmath8 represent occupation numbers 0 , 1 respectively for a given particle mode .",
    "thus each step of the pair creation process generates an entanglement entropy @xmath9 , and after @xmath10 steps of particle creation the entanglement is s_ent = n2 [ two ]     outside the horizon and @xmath11 inside .",
    "curvature length scale for a solar mass black hole is @xmath12 all over the region of evolution covered by the slices @xmath13 . ]",
    "this pair creation continues until the hole reaches planck size , at which point the emitted radiation is heavily entangled with the quanta in the hole .",
    "if the hole evaporates completely , the radiation can not be attributed _ any _ quantum state ",
    "the radiation is entangled , but there is nothing that it is entangled _",
    "with_. this possibility is termed ` information loss ' or ` loss of unitarity ' .",
    "if we are left with a remnant , then this remnant needs to have at least @xmath14 internal states to permit the entanglement ( [ two ] ) .",
    "since @xmath10 is unbounded , our theory must permit arbitrarily high degeneracy in a bounded volume with bounded energy budget ; something that is hard to achieve with normal quantum theories .",
    "many relativists had reconciled themselves to admitting remnants of some sort , perhaps with baby universes opening up inside the remnant where states could be hidden @xcite . but",
    "such remnants have not been found in string theory .",
    "how do we avoid being forced to ` information loss ' , which would imply a breakdown of string theory ?",
    "some string theorists have been seriously worried about this problem .",
    "but many others assumed that hawking s argument was somehow _",
    "flawed_. among the latter , the most common belief was the following . hawking computed the pair creation at leading order , but there can always be small quantum gravity corrections to the wavefunction ( [ three ] )    have added a small amount of an orthogonal state for the pair .",
    "the correction @xmath15 for each pair must be small since the horizon geometry is smooth .",
    "but the number of emitted quanta is large ( @xmath16 ) , and one might hope that the net effect of the small corrections can cumulate in such a way that the overall state of the radiation would be un - entangled with the hole . in that case , of course , there would be no real information paradox to worry about .",
    "but in @xcite it was shown that this hope is false ; the change in entanglement is bounded as < 2[four ] this inequality is the essential reason why the hawking argument has proved so robust over the years  no small corrections can save the situation .    to summarize , it can be rigorously argued that we must choose between one of the following : ( i ) we have information loss or remnants ( ii ) we find a way to get order _ unity _",
    "corrections to low energy physics at the horizon .",
    "with the above knowledge of the information problem , let us return to our analysis of holography .",
    "a common error is to argue the following :  many computations support the idea that gravity is dual to a gauge theory .",
    "since the latter is unitary , there can not be information loss in black holes .",
    "thus we have solved the information problem \" .",
    "as we will now see , this argument is completely incorrect , and arises from ignoring the power of the information paradox , encoded in ( [ four ] ) .",
    "we can approach gauge / gravity duality from two sides :    \\(i ) we know string theory at low energy gives gravity .",
    "low energy gravity ampltiudes can be reproduced by the gauge theory .",
    "but if we put together enough energy to make an ads - schwarzschild black hole , then the hawking argument tells us that we will get information loss .",
    "thus unless we find some way to bypass the hawking argument , _ gauge / gravity duality would fail at the same place where all other quantum gravity approaches fail : at the threshold of black hole formation_.",
    "\\(ii ) we can _ define _ the gravity theory as the dual of the gauge theory . in this case",
    "we can not lose unitarity . _",
    "but now we can not assume that the dual gravity theory has black holes .",
    "_ low energy amplitudes in the gauge theory agree with gravity .",
    "but if we take a large energy excitation in the gauge theory , then the natural timescale for dispersion of this energy is the _ crossing time _ of the black hole , not the much longer hawking evaporation time .",
    "if the energy disperses in order crossing time , we have no black hole in the theory .    as a concrete illustration of the above points",
    ", we can look at the simplest manifestation of a gauge / gravity type correspondence : the 1-d matrix model which is dual to 1 + 1 dimensional gravity @xcite .",
    "the low energy gravity theory is 1 + 1 dimensional dilaton gravity , in which we can make a black hole by throwing matter towards @xmath17 @xcite . with this black hole",
    "we find information loss or remnants , depending on how we complete the theory at the planck scale .",
    "the 1-d matrix model , on the other hand , gives a theory that must be unitary by construction .",
    "low energy amplitudes computed with the matrix model indeed reproduce the amplitudes of 1 + 1 dimensional dilaton gravity .",
    "but if we try to make a black hole with the matrix model then we _ fail _ : the energy of a collapsing shell bounces off the origin and returns in a time of order _ crossing time_. this difference in behavior between the matrix model and dilaton gravity is caused by higher order quantum corrections , which are small at low energies , but grow large enough at the black hole threshold to prevent black hole formation altogether @xcite .    in short , gauge / gravity duality has no direct bearing on the information problem . as we noted in the introduction ,",
    "the ` holography ' in gauge / gravity duality is not the same as the ` holography ' that arises for black holes from the entropy formula ( [ one ] ) .",
    "the holography of gauge / gravity duality can be verified for low energy correlators , but above the threshold of black hole formation the duality can not answer any quantum gravity questions until we understand the nature of gravitational states in this domain .",
    "the traditional approach of writing down the ads - schwarzschild metric for the black hole allows us to define thermal averages in the dual gauge theory , but can not tell us anything about how the information paradox is to be resolved . for the latter question ,",
    "we need to understand black hole microstates themselves .",
    "in string theory , we have to make black hole states from the objects present in the theory  strings and branes .",
    "it turns out that the size of brane bound states grows with the coupling and with the number of branes in the bound state  in such a way that the size of the state is always order horizon size @xcite .",
    "thus we do not get a traditional horizon with vacuum in its vicinity , as was assumed in the hawking computation ; instead we get a horizon sized ` fuzzball ' .",
    "the emission of low energy modes can therefore be modified by order unity , as required to solve the information paradox .",
    "further progress along these lines is obtained by taking specific states of the hole and constructing their gravity description . in each case",
    "we see that no horizon forms .",
    "it is interesting to see these constructions in the context of the no - hair conjectures that suggested that the traditional black hole geometry was _ unique_. in string theory we have extra compact dimensions , and a set of sources ( branes ) .",
    "these objects are all crucial to the structure of microstates",
    ". a compact circle ` pinches off ' before reaching the horizon , creating a smooth end to the spacetime geometry .",
    "this pinch - off generates a set of kaluza - klein monopoles and antimonopoles just outside the place where the horizon would have formed , and fluxes corresponding to brane charges wrap the topological cycles produced by this monopole structure .",
    "the simplest black hole is the extremal 2-charge hole made from d1 and d5 branes . for this hole",
    "we find the following :    \\(i ) the number of extremal bound states of the d1d5 brane system can be counted by abstract topological methods , and give a microscopic entropy @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) if we assume a spherically symmetric ansatz and a trivial factorization of the compact directions , then the low energy supergravity action gives an extremal black hole with horizon , with a bekenstein - wald entropy @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) the actual microstates of the d1d5 system can be constructed .",
    "it is found that they are not spherically symmetric and the compact directions are locally nontrivially fibered , though the net monopole charge of these fibrations vanishes .",
    "the solutions have no horizon and no singularity @xcite .",
    "\\(iv ) the phase space of these horizonless gravitational solutions can be quantized , and yields the entropy @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "\\(v ) though there is no horizon for any microstate , the region where the typical microstates exhibits their nontrivial structure has a boundary whose area @xmath21 satisfies @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "work on more complicated extremal holes @xcite has yielded a similar picture @xcite , though all microstates have not been constructed yet .",
    "some families of nonextremal microstates have been constructed as well @xcite , and again they have no horizon or singularity .",
    "but they do have _ ergoregions _ , and the rate of ergoregion emission @xcite agrees exactly with the hawking radiation rate expected for these microstates @xcite . but this time the radiation process does not lead to information loss ; the radiation is similar to that from a normal warm body .",
    "let us pause for a moment to see what the above discussion says about holography .",
    "we again find a difference between the case of the black hole and the case of gauge / gravity duality :    \\(a ) for the black hole , we have found that microstates do not have a ` traditional ' horizon .",
    "here we use the term ` traditional horizon ' to denote the kind of structure that had been historically assumed for black holes : a boundary from inside which light rays can not escape , with smooth spacetime in an open set around this boundary . instead , we have found a _ fuzzball _ ; the information of the microstate is encoded in the detailed structure of the microstate at the location where the horizon would have been . in short",
    ", there are _ real _ degrees of freedom at the surface which is used in the holographic expression ( [ one ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) in the case of gauge / gravity duality , there are no degrees of freedom apparent at the location of the boundary used for holography .",
    "this fact is related to the observation that the holographic boundary in this case can be moved to an arbitrary location in the ads region .",
    "we now turn to addressing a common question with black holes : what happens to a shell that is collapsing to make a black hole ?",
    "consider a shell of mass @xmath23 that is collapsing through its horizon radius @xmath24 .",
    "in ordinary 3 + 1 dimensional gravity the wavefunction of the shell moves in the expected way to smaller @xmath25 , creating the traditional black hole geometry .",
    "but in string theory the @xmath26 fuzzball states of the hole give alternate wavefunctions with the same quantum numbers as the shell .",
    "there is a small amplitude for the wavefunction of the shell to tunnel into one of these microstate wavefunctions .",
    "we may estimate this amplitude as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and we use @xmath29 for all length scales .",
    "this gives s_gravity~1 g d^4 x ~1 g 1(gm)^2(gm)^4~gm^2~ ( mm_p ) ^2 thus @xmath30 is indeed tiny .",
    "but we must multiply the tunneling probability by the _ number _ of states that we can tunnel to , and this is given by @xmath31 where s_bek = a4g~(gm)^2g~ ( mm_p ) ^2    thus the smallness of the tunneling amplitude is offset by the remarkably large degeneracy of states that the black hole has @xcite .",
    "the wavefunction of the shell tunnels into these fuzzball states in a time much shorter than the evaporation time of the hole @xcite , and then the fuzzballs states radiate energy much like any other normal body . in short ,",
    "the semiclassical approximation that leads to the standard black hole geometry gets invalidated by the large measure of phase space over which the wavefunction of the shell can spread .",
    "we can rephrase the above discussion in the following way .",
    "the information problem arose due to the ` good slicing ' of the black hole , in which we keep the slice smooth while stretching it more and more ( fig.[ftwo ] ) .",
    "this stretching creates the entangled pairs that lead to hawking s paradox . but",
    "with the above estimate of tunneling rates , we have a different situation . on an early time slice",
    "we can indeed arrange the wavefunction so that it describes a semiclassical spacetime containing a collapsing shell .",
    "but the wavefunction of a later slice has to be obtained by evolution ( using the hamiltonian constraint ) from the wavefunction on the initial slice .",
    "if we had a simple theory of quantum gravity , like canonically quantized general relativity , then evolution of the earlier slice would indeed give the ` stretched ' slice .",
    "but in string theory the situation is different .",
    "we have an enormous space of alternative solution to the gravity theory , where for example the compact directions can ` pinch off ' to make monopole pairs .",
    "we can take the wavefunction on the initial slice to be peaked around the smooth gently curved manifold , but the evolution will force this initial wavefunction to spread over the space of fuzzball solutions .",
    "thus instead of getting the ` stretched ' slice , we get a linear combination of fuzzballs , which then radiate from their surface just like any other warm body .",
    "we depict this spreading of the wavefunction in fig.[fa13 ] .",
    ".5 in$ ] fuzzball solutions , the wavefunction giving semiclassical geometry on the initial slice spreads over this vast phase space of solutions after some evolution , and we no longer get the traditional pair creation with growing entanglement.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we can also use this picture to address some related questions .",
    "marolf @xcite has discussed the information problem in the following language .",
    "suppose we assume that the gravity theory is holographically dual to a boundary field theory .",
    "then the boundary theory contains all the information in the bulk , and we can connect the bulk state at early times to the bulk state at late times by just evolving unitarily in the boundary theory .",
    "thus it seems impossible to have information loss in any theory with a gravity dual .    while this argument helps to frame the information problem in the context of gauge / gravity duality , note that we can not use it to argue away the paradox itself .",
    "the reasons are the same as those we discussed in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "if we start with some simple theory of gravity , then we do not know that it will have a holographic dual at the energies where black holes will form .",
    "if we start with the field theory and _ define _ bulk gravity as its dual , then we do not know that we will get black holes .",
    "but marolf s argument _ can _ be used to sharpen the puzzles arising from the paradox , as was done recently in a paper by heemskerk , marolf and polchinski @xcite .",
    "these authors asked if the dual field theory captured the state of a ` schrodinger s cat ' that was behind the horizon . at early times",
    "when there was no black hole , the dual field theory presumably did capture all details of the bulk , and therefore captured the state of the cat .",
    "evolution in the boundary is a known unitary evolution , so if the cat then evolved to be at a point inside the horizon , then its state would also be captured by the boundary theory .",
    "what appears puzzling though is that the radiation emitted from the hole should _ also _ capture the information of the cat , and one can draw a cauchy slice that captures both this radiation and the cat behind the horizon . since information can not be duplicated , one expects a kind of ` complementarity ' @xcite which somehow does not create a contradiction between the presence of these two copies .",
    "this argument , of course , is just a restatement of the usual information problem of black holes ; it appears sharper in the context of the dual field theory since this field theory is manifestly unitary and does not duplicate information .    with the help of fig.[fa13 ]",
    "we can see how the puzzle raised in @xcite is resolved with fuzzballs .",
    "suppose the initial slice contains the collapsing shell and the cat , in their usual semiclassical wavefunctions .",
    "but the slice that captures a significant part of the radiation involves a lot of stretching , and this evolution spreads the wavefunction away from semiclassical slices to a linear combination of fuzzballs .",
    "the data of the cat is encoded in these fuzzballs , and is then carried away in the radiation from the fuzzballs .",
    "this latter radiation is just like radiation from any warm body , as shown by the explicit ergoregion emission computations mentioned in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "we have seen that in string theory the microstates of black holes do not have a horizon ; the state ends in a quantum mess of string theory sources just outside the place where the horizon would have been . for simple microstates",
    "we have seen that hawking radiation emerges from the ergoregion in the geometry ; the rate of this radiation was exactly what was expected from this microstate .",
    "but there is no information loss , since the other member of the produced pair does not fall through a horizon ; instead it sits in the ergoregion , where it influences the production of future quanta .",
    "this is exactly the behavior required for an information carrying evaporation process .",
    "equivalently , we can probe the fuzzball with low energy quanta and discover its state .",
    "for example , quanta sent onto the ergoregion will lead to an enhanced stimulated emission from the ergoregion , so we can find the ergoregion spectrum . in short , we have a situation similar to that envisaged in the ` membrane paradigm ' @xcite , but the degrees of freedom at the horizon are _ real _ @xcite .",
    "we depict this in fig.[ftwoq ] .",
    "if we can not go ` through the horizon ' , then is there any significance to the traditional black hole geometry where we can continue past the horizon and fall into a singularity ?",
    "in @xcite it was argued that there is a way to understand the extended schwarzschild black hole geometry as an auxiliary spacetime which can be used to reproduce an approximation to appropriate correlators in the fuzzball solution .",
    "we describe this conjecture below . but first we need to describe a few background steps , for which we briefly summarize some earlier results .",
    "the fully extended schwarzschild geometry is depicted in fig.[fmal](a ) .",
    "this geometry has two asymptotic infinities , rather than the single infinity that we normally have in our world .",
    "israel @xcite postulated that we should think of the two sides of this penrose digram as describing two copies of our gravitational physics , in the same way that we take two copies of a field theory when using the ` real time formalism ' to study finite temperature dynamics .",
    "maldacena @xcite studied the dual cft description of the eternal hole in ads space .",
    "this time there are two asymptotically ads boundaries , and we should associate a cft with each boundary . using israel s connection to the real time formalism , maldacena arrived at the conclusion that the cft state describing the eternal hole is an _ entangled _ state of the form _",
    "i c_i |e_i_l|e_i_r [ pone ] just as we have been doing in the above sections .",
    "if we compute an expectation value of an operator @xmath32 in the r sector , then we will find an ensemble average over @xmath33 states , as before .",
    "but now consider a dynamical question .",
    "suppose we start with a spin on the r side , which is hopping leftwards towards @xmath34 .",
    "if the r and l sectors were totally decoupled , then the spin could never enter the l region .",
    "but for the system in fig.[fspin2](a ) we see that the two sectors are _ coupled_. the full hamiltonian has the form h = h_l+h_r+h_int where @xmath35 involve only l and r variables respectively , but @xmath36 couples these degrees of freedom .",
    "this coupling arises from the link on the lattice that joins the two spins closest to @xmath34 on the l and r sides .",
    "but if we return to our gravitational system , we see no such coupling .",
    "the states @xmath33 are fuzzballs that end smoothly ; there is no place to ` go through ' and link up with some other fuzzball in the l sector .",
    "but if there is no link to the l sector , then how do we imagine any approximation where we do invoke a spacetime that continues past the horizon ?    to see the essential idea that we will propose ,",
    "let us return to our lattice of spins and cut the link between the l and r sectors ( fig.[fspin2](b ) ) .",
    "now the hamiltonian has the form h = h_l+h_r and there is indeed no interaction between the l and r sectors .",
    "in this situation a spin starting in the r sector and heading towards @xmath34 will bounce back and return to larger @xmath37 values .",
    "in particular there are no degrees of freedom to ` hold ' the spin near @xmath34 for large times .",
    "a black hole , on the other hand , has a very large entropy concentrated in fuzzball states just outside @xmath2 . to mimic these degrees of freedom , we modify our spin model as shown in fig.[fspin3](a ) .",
    "the l and r sectors are still uncoupled . but",
    "a spin coming in towards @xmath34 from the r sector can move into a set of degrees of freedom placed near @xmath34 .",
    "this ` reservoir ' of states is large but finite .",
    "with this situation , the spin coming in from the r region towards @xmath34 does not immediately return back to larger @xmath37 .",
    "but it _ will _ eventually return ; after it reaches the bottom of the vertically drawn set of spins , it will bounce back up and return to the r region @xmath38 .",
    "this situation therefore mimics hawking radiation from the fuzzball ; incoming quanta are trapped for large times by the fuzzball degrees of freedom near @xmath2 , but since the number of degrees of freedom is finite , the information in the infalling quanta is eventually returned to infinity by radiation from the fuzzball surface .",
    "we imagine a similar reservoir of states for the l sector , as shown in the figure .",
    "now let us see how with this situation we can mimic the motion of a spin from the r sector to the l sector . the ground state ( [ pone ] ) of a typical system has a very particular relation between the l and r states .",
    "when we take a spin excitation in the r sector , we will again take a state that is carefully correlated with the state in the l sector .",
    "if the spin starts @xmath39 units to the right of @xmath34 in the r sector , then in the l sector we place a spin that in @xmath39 units deep in the _ reservoir _ set of states ( fig.[fspin3](b ) ) .",
    "the spin in the r sector starts at position a , and hops over to position b. it can not continue further left , but it travels down into the reservoir to position c. in the l sector , we had placed a spin in the reservoir at position d. this spin moves up to position e , and out left to position f.    note that the position of the spin at d is chosen such that it appears at e at just the correct time to mimic a spin that would have hopped over from position b. thus even though the r and l sectors are disconnected , we have managed to create a state which mimics hopping of a spin from the r to the l sector .",
    "the point of course is that it is not the same spin that moved from the r side to the l side , the spin on the r side was caught by the reservoir on the r side , and the reservoir on the l side spit out a spin at just the right moment so that it seemed that the spin continued its motion past @xmath34 .",
    "now let ask if we can do the same trick with gravity , where the reservoir of states will be the fuzzball degrees of freedom at the horizon .",
    "we have noted that the @xmath40 limit of the eternal black hole gives minkowski space ; let us work with this limit to make the equations below simpler .",
    "then the black hole exterior becomes rindler space .",
    "we choose coordinates @xmath41 for minkowski space .",
    "the picture we have is depicted in fig.[ffuzz1 ] .",
    "the boundary of the fuzzball is at a constant position trajectory just outside the horizon .",
    "we wish to consider a particle falling onto the fuzzball surface .",
    "the particle gets absorbed into the fuzzball degrees of freedom , but we wish to have another fuzzball surface , disconnected from the first , from which we can emit another particle .",
    "we wish to choose the location of this second surface ( and the time of emission ) such that the trajectory in the initial space and trajectory in the second space make up two segments of a straight line trajectory in minkowski spacetime .        to be more explicit , let us consider the spacetime diagram for such a construction , depicted in fig.[ffuzz3](a ) .",
    "let @xmath42 denote the proper time along the trajectory of the infalling particle .",
    "we let @xmath43 at the point where the particle meets the surface of the actual fuzzball . in the embedding minkowski spacetime",
    ", the particle would have continued for a proper time @xmath44 further before reaching the horizon @xmath45 . to make our construction symmetrical between the actual fuzzball and the auxiliary fuzzball , we allow an additional proper time @xmath44 to elapse along this trajectory . at this spacetime position",
    "we imagine placing the second ( auxiliary ) fuzzball surface .",
    "we choose the state of this auxiliary fuzzball such that a particle will be reemitted from it at the appropriate time and continue along the required particle trajectory in minkowski space .    to summarize , we wish to consider a straight line trajectory in minkowski space which crosses a rindler horizon .",
    "we break up this motion into two parts : a part in the right rindler wedge where the particle gets absorbed by a fuzzball surface , and a part in the forward rindler wedge where a second fuzzball surface reemits a similar particle , creating the illusion of continuous motion across the horizon . in the section",
    "below , we examine in a little more detail the location of the second fuzzball surface and the region of spacetime it creates .",
    "in this section we will argue that the surface of the auxiliary fuzzball that we use to recreate the motion past the horizon is a hyperbola in the forward rindler quadrant ( fig.[ffuzz3](b ) ) . to do this , we will consider a family of infalling particles , all hitting the fuzzball surface with the same relative velocity but at different times .",
    "for each such infall trajectory , we will locate the spacetime point @xmath41 in minkowski space where we must place the auxiliary fuzzball surface in order to recreate the continuation of the infalling trajectory .",
    "the set of points @xmath41 thus found ( one for each infalling trajectory ) will form a hyperbola in the forward rindler wedge .",
    "thus the recreated evolution will be in this forward rindler wedge .    in minkowski",
    "coordinates @xmath46 the actual fuzzball surface is given by a curve in the right rindler wedge t= ,  x= here @xmath15 is a small parameter giving the distance of the fuzzball surface from the horizon , and @xmath47 marks proper time along the fuzzball surface .",
    "the 4-velocity of a point on the fuzzball surface is ( we suppress variables transverse to @xmath41 ) u^t = dtd= ,  u^x = dxd= ,  -(u^t)^2+(u^x)^2=-1 now we wish to consider a particle falling onto this fuzzball surface .",
    "this particle will be travelling in a straight line in minkowski space ; in the corresponding black hole problem this would be a geodesic naturally described in kruskal coordinates .",
    "in minkowski space the trajectory of the infalling particle has 4-velocity v^t= ,  v^x= ,  ^2-^2=1 [ ptwo ] we write = ,  = where @xmath48 is a constant for the trajectory .",
    "we have @xmath49 since the particle is coming in from the right .",
    "let the proper time along the fuzzball surface at the point of impact be @xmath50 .",
    "the strength of the impact is described by ( u^a - v^a)^2=4 ^ 2_c-2 we write -f and hold @xmath51 fixed for all infalling trajectories ; thus they will all hit the fuzzball surface with the same impact .",
    "note that we impact the fuzzball surface from the right ; this corresponds to @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath42 be the proper time along the infalling particle trajectory ( [ ptwo ] ) .",
    "we chose the origin of @xmath42 so that @xmath43 at the moment of collision with the fuzzball surface .",
    "then the wordline of the infalling particle is t=",
    "+t_c ,  x=    + x_c [ pthree ] where t_c= ,  x_c= are the minkowski coordinates of the point of collision with the fuzzball surface .",
    "the horizon is at @xmath45 .",
    "the value of @xmath42 when the particle trajectory crosses the horizon is given by setting @xmath45 in ( [ pthree ] ) ; this gives =e^-(_c-)=e^-f this quantity @xmath44 gives the proper time that would have elapsed on the particle trajectory if it were to move from the point of collision outside the horizon to the horizon itself .",
    "we mark off another segment of proper length @xmath44 on the trajectory so that we are now ` equally far ' from the horizon on the other side of the horizon .",
    "this later point had the value =2=2e^-f for the proper time along the worldline . using ( [ pthree ] ) we find the minkowski coordinates @xmath53 of this final point t_f=2e^-f+t_c ,  x_f=2e^-f+x_c or more explicitly t_f=2e^-f(_c - f ) + ,  x_f=2e^-f(_c - f)+ finally we wish to examine the set of points @xmath53 that are obtained for different choices of the collision point @xmath54 on the fuzzball surface .",
    "we find the relation t_f^2-x_f^2=^2[1 + 2 e^-2f ] so the points that recreate the other side of the horizon lie along a spacelike hyperbola , and the quanta emitted from these points cover the forward rindler wedge ( fig.[ffuzz3](b ) ) .",
    "we have placed a set of auxiliary fuzzballs in a hyperbola in the forward wedge of rindler space ( fig.[ffuzz3](b ) ) .",
    "the particle trajectories emerging from these auxiliary fuzzballs travel in this forward wedge .",
    "this recreates motion in the forward wedge , but at this point we should ask : can we create such motion for an arbitrarily long time ?    consider the statistical model of fig.[fspin3](b ) .",
    "we have mimicked the motion past @xmath34 by putting an appropriate set of spins in the reservoir on the left ( l ) side .",
    "this reservoir is large , but finite .",
    "if it was 10 lattice sites deep , for instance , then we can set initial conditions so that we get any desired evolution for upto 10 time steps of hopping .",
    "but we can not mimic the evolution for longer than that .",
    "returning to the gravity problem , we see that we have two different situations :    \\(i ) the case where the entropy of the fuzzball is infinite .",
    "this is the case for rindler space , or for the hyperbolic black hole @xcite .",
    "in this case we have an infinite number of degrees of freedom , and can reconstruct the trajectories in the forward wedge with arbitrary accuracy .",
    "we can therefore expect that we can follow these trajectories for infinite time .",
    "\\(ii ) the case where the entropy of the fuzzball is finite .",
    "this is the case for the black hole , or for de sitter space . in this case",
    "we can reconstruct the trajectory only to some approximation , and therefore expect that we can only follow these trajectories for a finite time .",
    "interestingly , in these cases we note that the spacetime geometry of the forward wedge terminates in a singularity after some time , with this time increasing with the number of degrees of freedom present in the fuzzball ( bekenstein entropy ) .",
    "these observations suggest a fundamental origin of the usual singularity theorems of general relativity . once we make a closed trapped surface , the geodesics inside the surface must terminate in a singularity after a finite proper time .",
    "we now see that in the picture of complementarity that we have developed with auxiliary fuzzballs , the occurrence of such singularities may be a direct consequence of the finiteness of the number of degrees of freedom present in the fuzzball .",
    "one question that arises immediately in any discussion of complementarity is the following .",
    "if we can emit the information of an infalling quantum to infinity , and also have a copy of it fall past the horizon , then have not performed quantum ` cloning ' which is impossible on grounds of quantum mechanical linearity ?    to see how this issue gets bypassed in our construction , consider the statistical model of fig.[fspin3](b ) .",
    "the spin at a travels down to point c. but another copy of the spin placed at d emerges and travels to f. there is of course nothing wrong with duplication in this fashion : we have _ started _ with two copies of the spin , one at point a and one at point d. we have not taken one copy of the spin and required it to split into two copies  that would be cloning and is impossible .    in short ,",
    "if we make our auxiliary fuzzball to have a state that is carefully crafted to reflect the physics in the right rindler wedge , then we are not cloning , and there is no problem .",
    "any time two copies of a space are entangled , as in ( [ split ] ) , there is a precise correlation between the states of the two copies , but this _ not _ cloning .",
    "all we have done is extended such a map to states excited above the vacuum , and thus obtained a dynamics that continues past the horizon in the manner depicted in fig.[ffuzz3](b ) .",
    "the question that we could still ask is : _ why _ should we try to make such an extension ?",
    "should we not just say that the dynamics of the infalling particle ended at the fuzzball surface when it got absorbed into the fuzzball degrees of freedom ?",
    "for the black hole , we could indeed say this and stop ; having modified the dynamics at the horizon by order unity we have resolved the information paradox .",
    "but we have used fuzzballs in a second way  in the context of building spacetime by entanglement following the proposal of van raamsdonk @xcite .",
    "if we wish to have an entanglement relation like fig.[fn7 ] , then we need to be sure that all states in gravity are fuzzballs like fig.[fmal2](b ) and it is not the case that some states have _ horizons _",
    "like fig.[fmal2](a ) .",
    "assuming that all states are fuzzballs , we find that we can break up spacetime at _ any _ place into a complete set of fuzzballs ; this is just like partitioning minkowski space into its rindler sectors around an arbitrary location .",
    "in this situation we must find a way to reconstruct the full spacetime from just one rindler wedge , and this is where the continuation of spacetime using the auxiliary fuzzball comes in .",
    "in the early days of fuzzballs a question that was commonly asked was the following .",
    "if the spacetime ends at the horizon , then are we saying we go ` splat ' at the horizon ?",
    "if so , then how can we reconcile this with any picture where we expect to fall smoothly through the horizon ?",
    "complementarity seeks to achieve both these outcomes , but there was no way to realize complementarity in ordinary gravity .",
    "but now that we have seen a way to realize a kind of complementarity through fuzzballs , let us step back and ask more generally how one can go ` splat ' and yet be ` unchanged ' in another description . to illustrate the general notion we take a simple example : that of ads / cft duality",
    ".     passes smoothly into the ads interior .",
    "( b ) the ads region is replaced by the d1d5 brane cft .",
    "the graviton gets converted into a pair of vibrations on these branes moving in opposite directions , but all the information of the graviton is preserved . ]    in fig.[fads](a ) we have the geometry generated by a bound state of d1 and d5 branes .",
    "the geometry at infinity is minkowski space compactified on @xmath55 . near the branes",
    "there is a ` neck ' , and then an ads region .",
    "a graviton with indices in the torus is a scalar in ads ; let us take this graviton to be @xmath56 for concreteness where @xmath57 are the direction on @xmath58 .    in fig.[fads](b )",
    "we depict the picture where we use the open string description of the d - branes ; the open strings give vibrations of the branes which form the dual cft @xcite . the graviton @xmath56 hits the d1d5 brane state , getting converted to open string excitations on these branes . at leading order in the coupling , @xmath56 brakes into a pair of vibrations in the @xmath59 and @xmath60 directions .",
    "one can say that the graviton has gone ` splat ' to such an extent that it has decomposed into two parts .",
    "but in the description of fig.[fads](a ) the graviton has passed deep into the ads region , without distortion .",
    "how can the graviton go splat , and yet in some sense ` feel no change ' ?",
    "the reason is not hard to find .",
    "what has happened is that the hilbert space of states of the graviton @xmath56 has mapped faithfully into the hilbert space of vibrations @xmath61 of the d1-d5 brane system @xcite .",
    "if we map vectors from one space to another without changing dot products between vectors , then there is no alteration to the dynamics , though the physical realization of the system may look completely different .",
    "the fact that the map is faithful ( or close to faithful ) is due to the fact that the number of degrees of freedom in the d1d5 system is large , and we get ` fermi - golden rule ' absorption , which is insensitive to the precise energy levels ; it depends only on the density of states and the average coupling .",
    "( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion of absorption . )",
    "we can look more explicitly at how dynamics is encoded in these two descriptions @xcite .",
    "suppose we throw in a graviton @xmath56 , and a little while later , a graviton @xmath62 .",
    "the first graviton breaks into @xmath63 and these open string excitations start to separate from each other ( each moving at the speed of light ) along the @xmath64 direction shared by the d1 and d5 branes .",
    "the second graviton breaks into excitations @xmath65 , and these start to separate in a similar manner . in the gravity description of fig.[fads](a ) , we can say that the system consisting of the two gravitons is ` undistorted ' as long we maintain the separation between the gravitons . in the cft description",
    "we can recover the value of this separation by looking at the separation between @xmath63 and subtracting the separation between @xmath65 .",
    "thus the two gravitons have gone ` splat ' on the d1d5 branes , and yet managed to preserve all the structure that corresponds to their being ` undisturbed ' .",
    "let us see what we can and can not borrow from this ads / cft example for our fuzzball dynamics .",
    "the idea that we can go ` splat ' in one description , and yet continue smoothly in another description , is similar in the two cases .",
    "the difference is that in the fuzzball case we have real degrees of freedom at the fuzball surface that encode the data of the fuzzball .",
    "this is depicted in fig.[fnf](a ) , where the details of the jagged line carry this data .",
    "the emerging radiation thus carries the information of the fuzzball .",
    "when high energy quanta hit the fuzzball ( shown by the ingoing arrow in fig.[fnf](a ) ) , we can absorb their data in the collective modes of the fuzzball in a manner similar to that in the ads / cft duality example , and then construct an auxiliary spacetime as described above to continue the motion to an ` interior ' region .",
    "but it is important to note that we can not just take an analog of ads / cft and solve the information problem .",
    "that would be analogous to fig.[fnf](b ) , where we have no real degrees of freedom at the horizon , and try to capture the physics behind the rindler horizon with a dual cft placed at the rindler horizon .",
    "in that case the information does not come out in the hawking radiation .",
    "consider minkowski space divided into its four rindler quadrants . consider a free scalar field @xmath66 on this space , and",
    "let us see how we would compute the 2-point function g(x , x)=_m0 | t[(x)(x)]|0_m where both points @xmath67 are in the right rindler wedge .",
    "we further assume that @xmath67 are both very close to the rindler horizon , but not close to each other ( fig.[fads2 ] ) .",
    "we can compute @xmath68 in two ways .",
    "first , we can do the computation using only the states of the right rindler wedge . writing    _ m0|t[(x)(x)]|0_m&=&c^2_i , je^-e_i2e^-e_j2_le_i|e_j_l _",
    "re_i|t[(x)(x)]|e_j_r&=&c^2_i e^-e_i_re_i|t[(x)(x)]|e_i_r [ qwe1w ] to evaluate the above correlator , we can expand @xmath69 in rindler modes ( t_r , x_r)=_where @xmath70 are rindler coordinates . since the points @xmath67 have been taken to be well separated , the contribution to the correlator is from low energy modes .",
    "but since the points @xmath71 are close to the rindler horizon , the rindler states @xmath33 will be highly populated with these low energy quanta .",
    "the expectation value of the number operator @xmath72 for quanta with energy @xmath73 in a typical state @xmath74 is _",
    "re_i|n_|e_i_r ( the last approximation is for energies low compared to the rindler temperature ) .",
    "we can thus compute the correlator @xmath68 using states that are at high temperature .",
    "but there is a second way to compute the same correlator .",
    "we can expand @xmath66 in minkowski coordinates = _ k [ 1e^ikx - ita_k + 1e^-ikx+ita_k^ ] [ aone ] now the computation is much simpler ; we just insert ( [ aone ] ) in @xmath75|0\\rangle_m$ ] and obtain the result .",
    "this time we see no high temperature states ; instead we see just vacuum states .",
    "all this was of course elementary ; we can compute in rindler coordinates or in minkowski coordinates , and will get the same result each time .",
    "the point we wish to note is the following .",
    "in the rindler computation , we use a large number of degrees of freedom concentrated near the rindler horizon ; this is indicated by the grey band in fig.[fads2](a ) .",
    "the minkowski computation is not confined to such a band ; if we think in terms of path integrals , the paths summed over cross over the rindler horizon as shown in fig.[fads2](b ) .    now think of the same situation but with the gravitational field in place of the scalar field .",
    "the rindler states are just the fuzzball states discussed above .",
    "we are computing the correlator of two operators near the horizon . in one computation",
    "we use many degrees of freedom  the fuzzball states  near the horizon , and in the other we use the whole space but with no degrees of freedom visible near the horizon .",
    "the situation resembles what we see in ads / cft duality .",
    "the cft computation involves many degrees of freedom at the boundary .",
    "the gravity computation uses the interior of this boundary but not any degrees of freedom at the boundary itself .",
    "what is different from usual ads / cft is that both the descriptions we are comparing are in _ gravity _ itself : we can either use the full set of fuzzball degrees of freedom near the horizon surface , or the smooth spacetime past this surface .",
    "thus we have a gravity - gravity duality .",
    "there is one fact that we have not been careful about above .",
    "consider the rindler computation . because we took the points @xmath67 to be well separated , we got a contribution from near the horizon , but we will also in general get a contribution from paths that wander away from the horizon into the right rindler wedge .",
    "thus we can not really say that the rindler computation is confined to a surface near the horizon . to force the particle paths to stay confined near the horizon ,",
    "let us imagine a potential that pushes quanta to the left ( i.e. negative @xmath37 ) .",
    "this is depicted in fig.[fads3](a ) .",
    "now we will indeed have a computation that is confined to a lower dimension surface in spacetime .",
    "the computation using minkowski variables also involves particle paths that do not venture far into the region @xmath38 ; this is depicted in fig.[fads3](b ) .",
    "now we do have a close analog of ads / cft duality , but with both sides of the duality in gravitational variables .",
    "we can now ask if the fuzzball degrees of freedom can be interpreted as an effective cft ; in that case we would indeed have obtained an ads / cft type map from gravity alone .",
    "the natural candidate for the scale factor in such a cft would be the distance from the rindler horizon ; we have taken our points @xmath67 close to this horizon , but the precise distance from the horizon determines the rindler temperature we see in the rindler computation , and the value of this local temperature resembles the local scale factor .",
    "the potential of the kind indicated in fig.[fads3 ] arises in particular if we have ads space ; the gravitational field draws quanta to smaller @xmath25 values , which we take to be towards the direction @xmath76 in the figure .    if we do not have the kind of potential indicated in fig.[fads3 ] , then we have a somewhat different situation with our ` flat space holography '",
    ". we can compute correlators in the analog of rindler variables , or in the analog of minkowski variables , and the equality of these two is our ` duality ' .",
    "but the rindler computation ( using fuzzballs ) will typically use the whole right rindler wedge , and the minkowski computation will use the full minkowski region .",
    "our story on holography has taken many twists and turns , so it might be helpful to summarize it here :    \\(a ) we noted that the idea of holography that originated from black holes and the idea that is embodied in gauge - gravity duality are somewhat different . in black holes",
    "the boundary surface has a fixed location ( @xmath2 ) and the surface area gives the entropy ( [ one ] ) . in ads",
    "/ cft the boundary surface can be moved to any location in the ads region , and the area of this boundary does not give the entropy contained within .",
    "\\(b ) the traditional black hole has a horizon where physics is ` normal ' in a ` good slicing ' ( fig.[fdiss](a ) ) .",
    "the hawking computation showed that this situation leads to information loss / remnants , since pairs produced at the horizon lead to an ever increasing entanglement between the inside and the outside of the hole .",
    "it was believed by many people that small corrections to hawking s leading order computation could remove this entanglement , so we may still be able to preserve the notion of a regular horizon while getting information out in hawking radiation .",
    "but in @xcite it was shown , using subadditivity of quantum entropy , that this hope is _ false _ ; small corrections ( order @xmath77 ) to hawking s leading order computation can reduce the entanglement only by a small amount : < 2[fourq ] thus the horizon _ can not _ be a normal place for low energy physics if information is to come out in the hawking radiation .",
    "a corollary of this this theorem is that ads / cft duality can not by itself say anything about the information problem ; if we have a black hole with traditional horizon ( like the ads - schwarzschild hole ) then small quantum gravity effects can not lead to information recovery .",
    "the example of matrix models shows that if we define our gravity theory as the dual of a cft , then in general _ we will not get black holes_. thus the consequence of ( [ fourq ] ) is to tell us that the only way to resolve the information paradox is to find a source for order unity corrections to low energy physics at the horizon .",
    "\\(c ) people had looked for deformations of black holes in the past , but the metric of the hole had appeared to be stubbornly unique : this failure to find alternative solutions for given quantum numbers was encoded in the statement ` black holes have no hair ' . at first string theory",
    "does not seem to help ; if stringy effects are manifested only near the planck scale , then they would not affect hawking s argument .",
    "but in @xcite it was shown the phenomenon of ` fractionation ' gives bound states in string theory a size that grows with the number of branes in the state and with the string coupling , in such a way that the size of the bound state wavefunctional is always order horizon size .",
    "further progress along this direction is achieved by taking specific bound states and constructing their gravitational solution at the coupling where the black hole is expected .",
    "we find that a horizon does _ not _ form ; instead we get a fuzzball where the gravitational solution ends just outside the place where the horizon would have been , in a set of string theory sources ( kk monopoles , fluxes , branes , etc . ) .",
    "such solutions are termed fuzzballs , and they give a completely different picture ( fig,[fdiss](b ) ) for the states of the black hole .",
    "\\(d ) for the information problem , we need to examine the process by which hawking radiation is emitted from these fuzzballs . since there is no horizon , we do not find the ` pair creation from vacuum ' process that led to hawking s puzzle . for a set of simple nonextremal microstates",
    "it was found that emission occurs from the _ ergoregions _ in the geometry , and the rate of this emission is _ exactly _ the rate expected for hawking emission from these microstates .",
    "it is crucial that different microstates have differently placed ergoregions , and the emission is thus dependent on the microstate .",
    "this situation should be contrasted with other attempts at the information problem which seek to keep the regular horizon of fig.[fdiss](a ) .",
    "in many of these approaches one attempts to get the information out by invoking the ` high temperature degrees of freedom ' that are manifested in the schwarzschild coordinate frame .",
    "it is important to note that such a manifestation of high temperature can not get the information out ; it is simply a reflection of the failure of the schwarzschild coordinates at the horizon .",
    "what we find in the fuzzball construction is _ genuine _ degrees of freedom at the horizon .",
    "we can not obtain these genuine degrees of freedom without the full structure of string theory , which allows us to end the manifold outside the horizon by ` pinching off ' the compact directions into kk monopoles , and supporting the monopoles by branes / fluxes .",
    "\\(e ) finally , we may ask if there is any meaning at all to the traditional black hole geometry , given that all microstates end without horizon .",
    "we have argued that for the purposes of an infalling observer , we can construct an auxiliary spacetime where the infalling trajectory can be continued past a horizon .",
    "the notion of such a continuation is related to the idea of van raamsdonk @xcite of building spacetime by ` entanglement '",
    ". this construction looks like a version of complementarity , but it is different in a crucial way .",
    "we do not break up of the original black hole spacetime into different regions across a smooth horizon ; instead the spacetime ends outside the horizon in real degrees of freedom , and the continuation is only useful for describing infalling observers for a limited time using auxiliary degrees of freedom .",

    "<S> the idea of holography in gravity arose from the fact that the entropy of black holes is given by their surface area . </S>",
    "<S> the holography encountered in gauge / gravity duality has no such relation however ; the boundary surface can be placed at an arbitrary location in ads space and its area does not give the entropy of the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the essential issues are also different between the two cases : in black holes we get hawking radiation from the ` holographic surface ' which leads to the information issue , while in gauge / gravity duality there is no such radiation from the boundary surface . to resolve the information paradox we need to show that there are real degrees of freedom at the horizon of the hole ; this is achieved by the fuzzball construction . while the fuzzball has no interior to the horizon , we argue that an auxiliary spacetime can be constructed to continue the collective dynamics of fuzzball for times of order the crossing time ; this is an analogue of ` complementarity ' . </S>"
