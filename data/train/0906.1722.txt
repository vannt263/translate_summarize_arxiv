    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a general presentation of models and mathematical problems . in this introduction ,",
    "we start with the simplest accelerated frenkel - kontorova model where there is only one type of particle ( see eq .  ) .",
    "we then explain how to deal with @xmath0 types of particles ( see eq .  ) .",
    "we finally present the general case , namely systems of odes of the following form ( for a fixed @xmath1 ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the position of the particle @xmath4 at the time @xmath5 . here , @xmath6 is the mass of the particle and @xmath7 is the force acting on the particle @xmath8 , which will be made precise later .",
    "remark the presence of the damping term @xmath9 on the left hand side of the equation .",
    "if the mass @xmath6 is assumed to be small enough , then this system is monotone .",
    "we will make such an assumption and the monotonicity of the system is fundamental in our analysis .",
    "we recall that the case of fully overdamped dynamics , i.e. for @xmath10 , has already been treated in @xcite ( for only one type of particles ) .",
    "several results are related to our analysis .",
    "for instance in @xcite , homogenization results are obtained for monotone systems of hamilton - jacobi equations .",
    "notice that they obtain a system at the limit while we will obtain a single equation .",
    "techniques from dynamical systems are also used to study systems of odes ; see for instance @xcite and references therein .",
    "the classical frenkel - kontorova model describes a chain of classical particles evolving in a one dimensional space , coupled with their neighbours and subjected to a periodic potential . if @xmath5 denotes time and @xmath11 denotes the position of the particle @xmath12 , one of the simplest fk models is given by the following dynamics @xmath13 where @xmath6 denotes the mass of the particle",
    ", @xmath14 is a constant driving force which can make the whole `` train of particles '' move and the term @xmath15 describes the force created by a periodic potential whose period is assumed to be @xmath16 . notice that in the previous equation , we set to one physical constants in front of the elastic and the exterior forces ( friction and periodic potential ) . the goal of our work is to describe what is the macroscopic behaviour of the solution @xmath17 of as the number of particles per length unit goes to infinity .",
    "as mentioned above , the particular case where @xmath10 is referred to as the fully overdamped one and has been studied in @xcite .",
    "we would like next to give the flavour of our main results .",
    "in order to do so , let us assume that at initial time , particles satisfy @xmath18 for some @xmath19 and some lipschitz continuous function @xmath20 which satisfies the following assumption    * * initial gradient bounded from above and below * @xmath21 for some fixed @xmath22",
    ".    such an assumption can be interpreted by saying that at initial time , the number of particles per length unit lies in @xmath23 .",
    "it is then natural to ask what is the macroscopic behaviour of the solution @xmath17 of as @xmath24 goes to zero , _",
    "i.e. _ as the number of particles per length unit goes to infinity .",
    "to this end , we define the following function which describes the rescaled positions of the particles @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the floor integer part . one of our main results states that the limiting dynamics as @xmath24 goes to @xmath27 of is determined by a first order hamilton - jacobi equation of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a continuous function to be determined . more precisely , we have the following homogenization result    [ th:0 ] there exists a critical value @xmath30 such that for all @xmath310 , m_0^c]$ ] and all @xmath32 , there exists a continuous function @xmath33 such that , under assumption , the function @xmath34 converges locally uniformly towards the unique viscosity solution @xmath35 of .",
    "the critical mass @xmath30 is made precise in assumption ( a3 ) below .",
    "we now present the case of systems with @xmath0 types of particles .",
    "let us start with the typical problem we have in mind .",
    "let @xmath36 be some integer and let us consider a sequence of real numbers @xmath37 such that @xmath38 it is then natural to consider the generalized fk model with @xmath0 different types of particles that stay ordered on the real line .",
    "then , instead of satisfying , we can assume that @xmath39 satisfies for @xmath40 and @xmath4 @xmath41    such a model is sketched on figure [ f2 ] . as we shall see it , we can prove the same kind of homogenization results as theorem [ th:0 ] .    as we mentioned it before",
    ", it is fundamental in our analysis to deal with monotone systems of odes .",
    "inspired of the work of baesens and mackay @xcite and of hu , qin and zheng @xcite , we introduce for all @xmath4 the following function @xmath42 using this new function , the system of odes can be rewritten in the following form : for @xmath40 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 we point out that , in compare with @xcite , our proof of the monotonicity of the system is simpler .    it is convenient to introduce the following notation @xmath45    it would be also possible to consider more generally : @xmath46 with @xmath47 . in order to simplify here the presentation , we choose @xmath48 .",

    "the reader can be surprised by the fact that we obtain , at the limit , only one equation to describe the evolution of the system .",
