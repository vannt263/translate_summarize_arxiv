    "the parametrix technique for solving parabolic partial differential equations ( pdes ) is a classical method in order to expand the fundamental solution of such an equation in terms of a basic function known as the parametrix .",
    "this is the parallel of the taylor expansion of a smooth function in terms of polynomials .",
    "the concept of order of the polynomial in the classical taylor expansion is replaced by multiple integrals whose order increases as the expansion becomes more accurate .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to many equations and various situations .",
    "its success is due to its flexibility as it can be applied to a wide variety of pdes .",
    "it has been successfully extended to other situations for theoretical goals ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors consider the parametrix as an analytical method for approximations for continuous diffusions .",
    "these analytical approximations may be used as deterministic approximations and are highly accurate in the cases where the sum converges rapidly . in general , higher order integrals are difficult to compute and , therefore , this becomes a limitation of the method .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to introduce a general probabilistic interpretation of the parametrix method based on semigroups , which not only reexpresses the arguments of the method in probabilistic terms , but also to introduce an alternative method of simulation with no approximation error .",
    "this leads to the natural emergence of the difference between the generators of the process and its parametrix in the same manner as the concept of derivative appears in the classical taylor expansion .",
    "let us explain the above statement in detail .",
    "the first step in the monte carlo approach for approximating the solution of the parabolic partial differential equation @xmath0 is to construct the euler scheme which approximates the continuous diffusion process with infinitesimal operator @xmath1 . to fix the ideas , consider the diffusion process @xmath2 solution of the following stochastic differential equation ( sde ) : @xmath3 , x_0=x_0 , \\label{eq:1.1}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a multidimensional brownian motion and @xmath5 are smooth functions .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 $ ] the semigroup associated to this diffusion process . the infinitesimal generator associated to @xmath7",
    "is defined for @xmath8 as @xmath9 by the feynman ",
    "kac formula , one knows that @xmath10 is the unique solution to @xmath11 satisfying the initial condition @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the goal is to approximate @xmath13 first and then the expectation in @xmath14 $ ] using the law of large numbers which leads to the monte carlo method .",
    "now , we describe some stochastic approximation methods for @xmath13 . given a partition of @xmath15 $ ] , @xmath16 , the euler scheme associated to this time grid is defined as @xmath17 @xmath18 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & { } + b\\bigl(x_{t_{k}}^{\\pi } ( x)\\bigr ) ( t_{k+1}-t_k).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is well known ( see @xcite ) that @xmath19 is an approximation scheme of @xmath13 of order one .",
    "that is , there exists a constant @xmath20 such that @xmath21-\\mathbb{e } \\bigl[f\\bigl(x_{t}^{\\pi}(x)\\bigr)\\bigr]\\bigr{\\vert}\\nonumber \\\\[-8pt ] \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & \\qquad\\leq c_{f}(x)\\max\\{t_{i+1}-t_i;i=0,\\ldots , n-1\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath22 measurable and bounded ( see @xcite ) and under strong regularity assumptions on the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "roughly speaking , the parametrix method is a deterministic method with the following intuitive background : in short time the diffusion @xmath25 is close to the diffusion with coefficients `` frozen '' in the starting point @xmath26 .",
    "so one may replace the operator @xmath1 by the operator @xmath27 defined as @xmath28 and one may replace the semigroup @xmath29 by the semigoup @xmath30 associated to @xmath27 . clearly , this is the same idea as the one which leads to the construction of the euler scheme ( [ int3 ] ) .",
    "in fact , notice that the generator of the one step ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) euler scheme @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 .    the goal of the present article is to give a probabilistic representation formula based on the parametrix method .",
    "this formula will lead to simulation procedures for @xmath34 $ ] with no approximation error which are based on the weighted sample average of euler schemes with random partition points given by the jump times of an independent poisson process .",
    "in fact , the first probabilistic representation formula ( forward formula ) we intend to prove is the following : @xmath35=e^{t } \\mathbb{e } \\biggl[f\\bigl(x_{t}^{\\pi}\\bigr)\\prod _ { k=0}^{j_{t}-1}\\theta_{\\tau_{k+1}-\\tau_k } \\bigl(x_{\\tau _ { k}}^{\\pi},x_{\\tau_{k+1}}^{\\pi}\\bigr ) \\biggr].\\ ] ] here , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , are the jump times of a poisson process @xmath38\\}$ ] of parameter one and @xmath39 is a continuous time markov process which satisfies @xmath40 in the particular case discussed above , then @xmath41 corresponds in fact to an euler scheme with random partition points .",
    "@xmath42 is a weight function to be described later .    before discussing the nature of the above probabilistic representation formula ,",
    "let us remark that a similar formula is available for one - dimensional diffusion processes ( see @xcite ) which is strongly based on explicit formulas that one may obtain using the lamperti formula .",
    "although many elements may be common between these two formulations , the one presented here is different in nature .    in order to motivate the above formula ( [ eq : esf ] ) ,",
    "let us give the following basic heuristic argument that leads to the forward parametrix method : @xmath43 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & = & \\int _ 0^tp^x_{t - s } \\bigl(l - l^{x}\\bigr)p_sf(x)\\,ds.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we suppose that @xmath44 .",
    "the above expression is already an equivalent of a taylor expansion of order one where the notion of first - order derivative is being replaced by @xmath45 .",
    "its iteration will lead to higher order taylor expansions .",
    "another way of looking at this is to consider ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) as a volterra equation in @xmath46 .",
    "this will be our point of view here .",
    "in fact , if @xmath47 is considered as the time variable and considering ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) as an equation , one sees , after an application of the integration by parts on the diffferential operator @xmath48 , that @xmath49\\}$ ] for @xmath50 can also be considered as a solution of the following volterra type linear equation : @xmath51 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & = & p_t^xf(x)+\\int_0^t \\int\\theta _ { t - s}(x , y_1)p_{t - s}^x(x , y_1)p_sf(y_1)\\,dy_1\\,ds.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we have used the function @xmath52 , defined as @xmath53 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & \\qquad=\\frac{1}2\\sum_{i , j } \\partial_{i , j}\\bigl ( \\bigl(a^{i , j}(\\cdot)-a^{i , j}(z ) \\bigr)p^z_{t - s}(x,\\cdot)\\bigr ) ( y_1)\\\\ & & \\qquad\\quad{}-\\sum _ i\\partial _ i\\bigl ( \\bigl(b^i(\\cdot)-b^i(z)\\bigr)p^z_{t - s}(x , \\cdot)\\bigr ) ( y_1 ) \\bigg|_{z = x}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) can be iterated in @xmath54 in order to obtain a series expansion of the solution which is the equivalent of the taylor expansion of @xmath54 .",
    "we may note that the second term in this expansion for @xmath55 can be rewritten using the euler scheme with partition points @xmath56 as @xmath57 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & \\qquad = \\int_0^t\\mathbb{e}\\bigl[f \\bigl(x_t^{\\pi}(x)\\bigr)\\theta_{t - s } \\bigl(x , x_{t - s}^{\\pi } ( x)\\bigr)\\bigr]\\,ds.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the first step toward the construction of what we call the forward parametrix method . will denote the integrating variables in the order given by the corresponding euler scheme .",
    "similar rule will apply with the times @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "for example , we will have that @xmath60 in ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) . ]",
    "it requires the regularity of the coefficients and it is based on the usual euler scheme for the sde ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) .",
    "note that ( [ eq:2.11 ] ) will be associated with the term @xmath61 in ( [ eq : esf ] ) .",
    "in fact , if there is only one jump of the poisson process @xmath62 in the interval @xmath15 $ ] , then the distribution of the jump is uniform in the interval @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "this leads to the probabilistic interpretation of the time integral in ( [ eq:2.11 ] ) .",
    "let us now discuss an alternative to the above method which requires less regularity conditions on the coefficients of ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) .",
    "this method will be called the backward parametrix method and it is obtained by duality arguments as follows .",
    "that is , consider for two functions @xmath63 the pairing @xmath64 .",
    "then we will use the approximating semigroup @xmath65 . a  similar heuristic argument",
    "gives @xmath66 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & = & \\int_0^t\\int\\hat\\theta _ { t - s}(y_1,y)p_{t - s}^y(y_1,y)p^*_sg(y_1)\\,dy_1\\,ds.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in this case the operator @xmath67 is applied to the density function @xmath68 with the coefficients frozen at @xmath69 , therefore , no derivative of the coefficients is needed in this approach .",
    "in fact , @xmath70 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & \\qquad= \\bigl(l - l^z\\bigr)p_{t - s}^z ( \\cdot , y ) ( y_1 ) |_{z = y } \\\\ & & \\qquad= \\biggl\\{\\frac{1}2 \\sum_{i , j } \\bigl(a^{i , j}(y_1)-a^{i , j}(z)\\bigr ) \\partial_{i , j } \\nonumber \\\\[-8pt ] \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & \\hspace*{32pt}\\qquad{}+\\sum_i\\bigl(b^i(y_1)-b^i(z ) \\bigr)\\partial _ i \\biggr\\ } p^z_t(\\cdot , y ) ( y_1 ) \\bigg|_{z = y}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as before , we can obtain a probabilistic representation . in this case , one has to be careful with the time direction .",
    "in fact , due to the symmetry of the density function @xmath71 one interprets it as the density of the euler scheme at @xmath72 started at @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the sign of the drift has to be changed leading to what we call the backward parametrix method . in the particular case",
    "that @xmath22 is a density function , it will be interpreted as a `` backward running '' euler scheme from @xmath73 to @xmath74 with random initial point with density @xmath22 .",
    "the test function @xmath75 is replaced by a dirac delta at the initial point of the diffusion @xmath76 .",
    "see section  [ sec : back ] for precise statements .",
    "therefore , the behavior of forward and backward methods are different .",
    "in fact , the forward method applies when the coefficients are regular . in many applied situations",
    ", one may have coefficients which are just h \" older continuous and , therefore , the forward method does not apply . in that case , one may apply the backward method which demands less regularity . for this reason , the treatment of the forward method and the backward method",
    "are essentially different and they are treated separately .",
    "issues related to simulation will be discussed in another article .",
    "our article is structured as follows : in section  [ sec:2 ] , we give the notation used throughout the paper . in section",

    "the first corresponds to the continuous diffusion with uniformly elliptic diffusion coefficient .",
    "we see in section  [ sec:6.1 ] that in the forward approach we need the coefficients to be smooth .",
    "while in section  [ sec:6.2 ] , we show that in order for the backward approach to be applicable , we only require the coefficients to be h \" older continuous . in section  [ sec : jumps ] , we also consider the case of a jump driven sde where the lvy measure is of stable type in a neighborhood of zero .",

    "the adjoint method we introduced here seems to allow for the analysis of the regularity of the density requiring hlder continuity of the coefficients through an explicit expression of the density .",
    "finally , the stochastic representation can be used for simulation purposes . in that case , the variance of the estimators explode due to the instability of the weight function @xmath52 in the forward method or @xmath780 in the backward method .",
    "in fact , the representations presented here have a theoretical infinite variance although the mean is finite . in that respect , the way that the poisson process and the exponential jump times appear maybe considered somewhat arbitrary .",
    "in fact , one can think of various other representations which may lead to variance reduction methods .",
    "preliminary simulations show that different interpretations of the time integrals in the parametrix method may lead to finite variance simulation methods .",
    "many of these issues will be taken up in future work .",
