    "the generation of quantum effects in nano - mechanical cavities with movable mirrors has been the subject of a great interest in recent years  @xcite .",
    "this interest stems from the possibility of the development of new practical techniques for cooling macroscopic objects to very low temperatures and for engineering of entangled states of macroscopic systems . with the recent progress in laser cooling techniques , fabrication of low - loss optical elements and high-@xmath0 mechanical resonators",
    ", it is now possible to prepare nanomechanical oscillators that can be controlled to a very hight precision and can even reach the quantum level of the oscillations  @xcite . in these systems , the vibrations of mechanical oscillators are induced by radiation pressure that creates a strong nonlinear coupling of the vibrational mode to radiation modes .",
    "most of these studies have been done on examples provided by cavity optomechanical systems with linear or ring cavities  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that a large radiation pressure can be generated in the cavity that in return may lead to entanglement between different components of the system . in particular ,",
    "stationary entanglement has been predicted between the cavity mode and a vibrating mirror  @xcite , between an atomic ensemble or a bose - einstein condensate located inside an optical cavity and the vibrating mirror of the cavity  @xcite , between two vibrating mirrors of a ring cavity  @xcite , between two dielectric membranes suspended inside a cavity  @xcite , and between a membrane and a trapped atom both located inside a cavity  @xcite .",
    "further studies have addressed interesting problems of entangling mechanical oscillators  @xcite , entangling optical and microwave cavity modes  @xcite , and the creation of a photon by a vibrating mirror  @xcite . in this connection",
    ", we should mention the most recent work on the generation of entanglement in pulsed cavity optomechanics  @xcite , and the work on the creation of entanglement between two oscillating mirrors through the coupling of the mirrors to an atomic system  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore coherence and correlation features of an optomechanical system composed of three bosonic modes realized with an one - dimensional optical lattice located inside a single - mode cavity with a movable mirror .",
    "we are particularly interested in the effect of the first - order correlation ( first - order interference ) on entanglement between two modes which is associated with second - order correlation functions .",
    "it is well known that in the parametric down - conversion , served as a typical source of entanglement , the signal and the idler beams are strongly entangled but always behave as mutually incoherent  @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion applies to the correlations between modes of the optomechanical system , where it was demonstrated that the cavity and mechanical modes play the same role as the signal and the idler of a nondegenerate parametric oscillator and the modes behave as mutually incoherent  @xcite .",
    "this seems to suggest that entanglement between two modes rules out the first - order coherence between them .",
    "we consider various situations where the modes of the optomechanical system can be made mutually coherent and to exhibit the first - order interference .",
    "this leads to an obvious question of to what extent of the first - order coherence could affect entanglement between the modes . to address this question , we use a polariton model of the optical lattice coupled to a single - mode cavity field and calculate various coherence and correlation functions of the optomechanical system .",
    "we show that the system is capable of generating a wide class of coherence and correlation effects , ranging from the first - order coherence , the anomalous autocorrelations and anomalous cross correlations between the modes . in a series of simple examples",
    "we show that the generation of the first - order coherence between two modes of the system is equally effective in destroying entanglement between these modes .",
    "we illustrate our considerations by examining two and three mode interactions . after establishing the connection between the generation of entanglement and the first - order coherence",
    ", we consider the problem of the creation of entanglement between two independent modes by coupling them to an intermediate mode .",
    "we show that the coupling of the modes to the intermediate mode by a parametric interaction results in no entanglement between the modes . we then consider a different coupling configuration and find that an entanglement can be generated between two independent modes if one of the modes is coupled to the intermediate mode by the parametric interaction and the other is coupled by the linear - mixing interaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] with the description of the model .",
    "we represent the finite size optical lattice that is located inside a single - mode cavity in terms of bloch - type waves called excitons , and diagonalize the interaction hamiltonian of the excitons plus the cavity mode to describe the system in terms of bright polaritons .",
    "we then proceed in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] to study the dynamics of the system in terms of the quantum langevin equations for relevant variables .",
    "we use the linearization approach to the equations of motion and arrive to a set of three couple differential equations for the fluctuation operators , which we solve for the steady - state .",
    "we apply the solution in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] to the calculation of the bipartite coherence and correlation functions of the polariton and the mechanical modes .",
    "we discuss the conditions for entanglement in terms of the squeezing fluctuations and the cauchy - schwartz inequality .",
    "the anomalous autocorrelation and cross correlation functions are introduced to discuss conditions for the violation of the cauchy - schwartz inequality .",
    "a possibility of generating a two - color entanglement is also discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we evaluate the first - order coherence and entanglement in the case of three coupled modes .",
    "two coupling configurations of two independent modes to the intermediate mode are discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] , we examine parameter ranges in which the predicted coherence and correlation effects could be observed with the current experiments . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec7 ] we summarize our results .",
    "[ sec2 ]    we consider a finite size one - dimensional optical lattice located inside a single - mode cavity with one fixed partially transmitting mirror and one movable perfectly reflecting mirror , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mirfig1 ] .",
    "the optical lattice is composed of  @xmath1 regularly spaced and non - overlapping sites located at positions @xmath2 , with total length @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the separation between the sites and @xmath5 is the cavity mode waist at the position of the lattice  @xcite .",
    "the lattice is formed by two counterpropagating laser beams entering the cavity from the sides and forming a standing wave in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the cavity mode .",
    "the cold atoms loaded on the optical lattice are confined in an array of microscopic trapping potentials , forming a mott - insulator - like medium with one atom per site  @xcite .",
    "the atoms in the optical lattice are modeled as two - level systems with ground state @xmath6 and excited state @xmath7 , separated by the transition frequency @xmath8 and connected by a transition dipole moment @xmath9 , which can be assumed to be real with no loss of generality . since the optical lattice is formed in the direction perpendicular to the cavity axis , the effect of the motion of the atoms ( center of mass motion ) on the coupling strength of the atoms to the cavity mode and on the radiation pressure on the movable mirror can be ignored .",
    "the situation would be different and the center of mass motion important if the optical lattice were generated along the cavity axis by the cavity mode  @xcite , or by a standing wave formed by running and reflected from the movable mirror laser beams  @xcite .",
    "the motion of the movable mirror is modeled as a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator of mass @xmath10 and resonant frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the cavity mode is driven by an external laser field which is treated classically in our calculations and is characterized by its frequency @xmath12 and amplitude @xmath13 .",
    "it has become common to consider the laser field as a source of the radiation pressure force on the movable mirror .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     figure  [ mirfig5 ] shows the logarithmic negativity @xmath14 for fixed @xmath15 and gradually increasing @xmath16 and @xmath17 . as in the case of two coupled modes",
    ", the logarithmic negativity is determined from the steady - state correlation matrix , which in the present case is a @xmath18 matrix derived by solving an equation that is formally identical with eq .",
    "( [ e61e ] ) , but with the drift matrix @xmath19 given by @xmath20 and with the diffusion matrix @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ mirfig5 ] that entanglement occurs for @xmath22 where it is present for all @xmath17 .",
    "the degree of the entanglement increases with  @xmath17 , the strength of the linear mixed process .",
    "note that the entanglement is reduced when @xmath17 is comparable to @xmath23 , and increases as @xmath17 departures from @xmath23 .",
    "we conclude this section that two independent modes may become entangled by a suitable coupling to an intermediate mode .",
    "the entanglement occurs when one of the modes couples to the intermediate mode by the parametric interaction process whereas the other couples by the linear - mixing interaction .",
    "[ sec6 ]    finally , we examine parameter ranges in which the predicted coherence and entanglement effects could be observed with the current experiments . as a check on the validity of the limitation to only the @xmath24 exciton",
    ", we evaluate the formula  ( [ e20 ] ) for @xmath25 using experimentally realistic parameters of an optical lattice composed of @xmath26rb atoms  @xcite . by taking @xmath27 sites , the cavity mode volume @xmath28 [ m@xmath29 , the atomic transition dipole moment @xmath30 [ cm ] of the hyperfine transition 5 @xmath31 5 @xmath32 in an @xmath26rb atom , and the cavity frequency @xmath33 on resonance with the first @xmath24 exciton mode that is comparable to the atomic transition frequency of @xmath34 [ hz ]",
    ", we obtain for the coupling strength of the first @xmath24 exciton , @xmath35 [ hz ] , and for the third @xmath36 exciton , @xmath37 [ hz ] that is one order smaller than the @xmath24 coupling strength .",
    "this simple estimation of the coupling strength shows that @xmath25 decays very fast with @xmath38 .",
    "thus , our theory can describe the single exciton system quite accurately .",
    "the stability condition for the three mode coupling case requires @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 . since @xmath42 [ hz ] and the typical coupling strengths @xmath43 [ hz ]",
    ", the inequality @xmath39 can be satisfied with the realistic experimental parameters .",
    "[ sec7 ]    in summary , we have presented an analytical study of coherence and correlation effects produced in a single - mode nano - mechanical cavity containing an optical lattice of regularly trapped atoms . the system considered is equivalent to a three - mode system composed of two polariton modes and one mechanical mode . we have shown that the system is capable of generating a wide class of coherence and correlation effects , ranging from the first - order coherence , the anomalous autocorrelations and anomalous cross correlations between the modes .",
    "we have been particularly interested in the relationship between the generation of entanglement and the first - order coherence in the system .",
    "the results show that the generation of the first - order coherence between two modes of the system is equally effective in destroying entanglement between these modes .",
    "there is no entanglement between the independent polariton modes when both modes are simultaneously coupled to the mechanical mode by the parametric ( squeezing - type ) interaction .",
    "there is no entanglement between the polaritons even if the oscillating mirror is damped by a squeezed vacuum field .",
    "the intermediate mechanical mode effectively creates the first - order coherence between the modes .",
    "finally , we have shown that in order to effectively entangle independent modes , in this system , one of the modes should be coupled to the intermediate mode by a parametric interaction but the other mode should be coupled by the linear - mixing ( beamsplitter - type ) interaction .",
