    "strong laser fields composed of waves with orthogonal polarizations are a useful resource for controlling strong - field phenomena , such as high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) and its applications , for example in the creation of attosecond pulses @xcite .",
    "they have also gained a great deal of attention as potential attosecond imaging tools .",
    "for instance , orthogonally polarized fields may be used to probe degenerate orbitals , molecules that are difficult to align , and also allow the reconstruction of molecular orbitals from a single - shot measurement @xcite .",
    "this control is possible due to the physical mechanism behind hhg @xcite , namely the laser - induced recombination of an electron with a bound state of its parent molecule .",
    "thereby , an electron is typically freed by tunnel ionization , acquires kinetic energy from the field while propagating in the continuum and , subsequently , releases this energy as high - frequency radiation if it recombines with its parent molecule .",
    "this means that the hhg spectrum contains information about the atom or molecule from which it was generated , such as vibrational motion @xcite , electron motion @xcite and electronic structure @xcite .",
    "this information can be used for example in the reconstruction of molecular orbitals @xcite .",
    "furthermore , orthogonally polarized fields provide extra degrees of freedom .",
    "this introduces an angle of ionization and recombination for the electron , and allows one to steer the electron propagation in the continuum .",
    "for instance , depending on the field parameters , the electron may return at a particular angle , which can be controlled @xcite and varies with the harmonic frequency @xcite .",
    "care must be taken , however , as there may be features that are not related to the target , but to the field itself .",
    "one option is to keep the wave along the minor polarization axis weak enough , so that these distortions are minimized @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a weak field limits the possibility of steering the electron trajectory .",
    "another option is to understand how a non - vanishing field ellipticity modifies the information in the hhg spectra .",
    "this can then be used either to disentangle the influence of the field , and thus probe the molecular target , or to understand the electron dynamics in the continuum .",
    "for instance , it may happen that features that are purely structural may acquire dynamic aspects if the field ellipticity is non - vanishing .",
    "a good example are the interference patterns related to electron recollision in different centers in the molecule . for linearly polarized fields , these patterns are well understood and have been studied since the early 2000s @xcite ( for reviews see , e.g. , @xcite and our recent publication @xcite ) , at least within the single - active electron , single - active orbital approximation . in this case , the aligned diatomic molecule acts like the microscopic counterpart of a double - slit experiment , and the interference maxima and minima depend only on the internuclear distance and the molecule orientation with regard to the field . a particularly good method for assessing this type of interference is the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) , which allows an intuitive interpretation of the problem in terms of electron orbits .",
    "for that reason , it has been widely employed in the study of molecules @xcite ) .",
    "the sfa , however , has serious limitations .",
    "apart from the gauge dependence and its influence on the structural interference @xcite , different forms of recombination dipole matrix element affect this condition @xcite .",
    "the most appropriate form to be used has raised considerable debate in the context of the tomographical reconstruction of molecular orbitals @xcite    if the field however is orthogonally polarized , the electron s angle of return is effectively incorporated in the two - center interference condition .",
    "this angle will depend on the orbit along which the electron comes back to its parent ion @xcite .",
    "hence , different orbits will have different start and return times , which are heavily dependent on the field parameters and the harmonic energy .",
    "for coherent superpositions of orbits , this will cause a blurring in structural interference conditions .",
    "the outcome of many studies show such effects , but do not relate them to the electron s angle of return @xcite . in previous work",
    ", we have analyzed these effects in detail @xcite , and shown that they are present in the hhg macroscopic response for carefully chosen propagation conditions @xcite .",
    "this provides a tool for determining the electron s return angle in an experimental setting .",
    "another well known structural feature is that , when a nodal plane is in alignment with the polarization of the field , there is a drop in hhg efficiency across the whole spectrum ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this suppression arises from the fact that nodal planes are areas of vanishing probability density in the wavefunction of a molecule . vanishing probability density means that neither ionization nor recombination can take place @xcite .",
    "further studies in @xcite compared the signals of nodal planes in isoelectronic homonuclear and heteronuclear diatomic molecules in hhg spectra . for the latter case",
    "the nodal planes were distorted into nodal surfaces .",
    "this caused the suppression in the spectrum to appear at different angles , in comparison to the homonuclear molecule .",
    "similar distortions appear in the hhg spectra calculated in @xcite for hhg in elliptically polarized fields , but they have not been analyzed .",
    "therein , the suppressions related to nodal planes appear to shift and bend if the ellipticity of the driving field is increased @xcite .",
    "our previous work @xcite indicates that the origin of these distortions lie on dynamic effects introduced by the electron s returning angle .",
    "this is an open question as previous publications that have addressed nodal - plane suppressions and elliptical fields @xcite have focused on ionization , but not recombination .",
    "they found that , although on their own nodal planes and elliptical field suppress ionization , the combination of both can in fact compensate for each other .",
    "this increases the hhg signal when the major polarization axis and the nodal plane are in alignment .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the influence of the driving - field ellipticity on the hhg suppression caused by nodal planes . using the equation for the effective shift of an returning electron presented in @xcite , we are able to predict where in the spectrum the nodal suppression will appear for a particular harmonic .",
    "because this shift is orbit - dependent , the alignment angle for which the nodal - plane suppression appear will vary across the hhg spectrum .",
    "these features are investigated in detail for @xmath0 in one- and two - color orthogonally polarized fields . in this work ,",
    "we employ the single - active electron , single - active orbital approximation and neglect core dynamics .",
    "the latter issue has been addressed in , for instance , @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ theory ] , we provide the necessary theoretical background .",

    "we neglect the motion of the nuclei and use the single active orbital approximation , which assumes that only the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) contributes to the dynamics .",

    "this is expected , as @xmath89 depends on @xmath13 and @xmath48 , which vary for the long and short orbits .",
    "in fact , the shift for the long orbit displaces the nodal - plane suppressions to the right , while for the short orbit this displacement is to the left .",
    "we also see that the displacement decreases for both orbits with increasingly higher harmonics . at the cutoff ,",

    "the real parts of the shifts vanish .",
    "consequently , the nodal - plane suppression will approach the position obtained for a linearly polarized field .",
    "the reason for this is that around the cut - off the electron is expected to return at a crossing of the electric field , i.e. , at a crest of the parallel vector potential [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) ] . at such times , both orbits experience a vanishing perpendicular vector potential , which translates into a vanishing shift around the cut - off . below the cut - off ,",
    "the short and long orbits are subjected to equal but opposite perpendicular momenta , which increase for decreasing harmonic frequency .",

    "the latter is strongly exaggerated for lower harmonics , and even meet the other shifted suppressions near the ionization threshold ( see dot - dashed lines in the picture ) .",

    "the length or velocity form of the sfa dipole matrix elements has been a cause of much debate . in the single - active electron , single - active orbital approximation , it is known that the velocity form is in superior in predicting structural interference minima , and provides the best agreement with the double - slit physical picture @xcite . however , for linearly polarized driving fields the spurious terms introduced by the length form are well understood and easy to eliminate .",
    "they are caused by the lack of orthogonality between the bound and continuum states that exists in the sfa @xcite , and are absent from the start in the expressions used in this paper [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : dipolelenght ] ) ] .    the results in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] to [ fig3 ] tell us that , although for a linearly polarized field the form of the dipole operator may not make much difference , to the nodal suppressions in the hhg spectrum for an elliptically polarized field it does .",
    "this is because in this type of field the returning electron can probe dynamics of the wavefunction that would previously be unreachable .",
    "this exposes other artifacts in both forms of the sfa dipole , which are more difficult to eliminate .",
    "nonetheless , the velocity form provides better results , if compared to the length form .      , and the individual contributions of the long [ panels ( c ) and ( d ) ] and short orbits [ panels ( e ) and ( f ) ] , respectively .",

    "the ellipticity is increased from @xmath71 = 0 to @xmath71 = 0.3 in increments of @xmath90= 0.05 .",
    "a lighter color indicates a higher ellipticity and a vanishing shift is indicated by a vertical black line .",
    "panel ( h ) provides a schematic representation of the major and minor components of the vector potential a(t ) for ellipticity @xmath71 = 0.3 and relative phase @xmath91 = -0.1 .",

    "all fields have been normalized to the vector potential amplitude a@xmath93 = e@xmath94 . ]    in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] the shift of the nodal - plane suppression is quite large , especially for lower harmonics . however , around the cutoff the shift vanishes .",
    "since , however , the long and the short orbit merge at the cutoff , this would be the best region to observe the shift if a coherent superposition of orbits is taken into consideration @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if one wishes to observe these shifts experimentally , it would be more convenient if they occurred for the whole harmonic range in the spectrum . in this section",
    "we will discuss field choices which are favorable to this behavior .    since the shifts are strongly dependent on the time delay between the parallel and perpendicular waves , choosing a different relative phase @xmath91 changes the behavior of the shift .",
    "an example is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , for which the parallel and perpendicular driving waves have a phase difference of @xmath118 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we show the sfa transition probabilities computed for this phase , using the whole dominant pair , the long and the short orbit [ first , second and third row , respectively ] . for comparison ,",
    "we include results in the length [ panels ( a ) , ( c ) and ( e ) ] and velocity [ panels ( b ) , ( d ) and ( f ) ] forms of the sfa . in contrast to what has been observed in the previous figures , the shifts are now present for the whole harmonic range , including the cutoff region .",
    "our results indicate that the shift would be easier to observe for the short orbit , as it is much larger in this case .",
    "this is convenient for experiments as the short orbit is much easier to isolate through phase matching @xcite .",
    "[ fig5](g ) , in which @xmath120 $ ] is plotted , is also markedly different from fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "for instance , for the long and short orbit , the residual shift at the cut - off is positive .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath121 is non - vanishing and positive at the cutoff return times [ see fig .  [ fig5](h ) ] .",
    "once more , we see a better overall agreement between the analytical condition and the velocity form of the sfa . for the coherent superposition of the two orbits [ figs .",
    "[ fig5](a ) and ( b ) ] , despite some blurring in the plateau and threshold harmonics , the shift can be seen very clearly at the cutoff .",
    "for all nodes , only the velocity form gives the correct shifts [ fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ] .     for o@xmath77 ( ionization potential @xmath780.2446 a.u . and internuclear separation @xmath79 a.u . ) .",
    "the parameters used are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , but with @xmath65 for the perpendicular wave , which is in phase ( @xmath122 ) with the parallel component of the laser field .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( c ) give the individual contributions to the hhg spectrum from the long and short orbit respectively , whilst ( b ) shows the coherent superposition of these orbits .",
    "the black dashed lines indicate the positions of the nodal - plane suppressions in the spectrum for a linearly polarized field , whilst the white short dashed and red curves give the calculated position of the suppression for the long and short orbit , respectively , for elliptically polarized fields . the harmonic yield is given in a logarithmic scale .",
    "the increase in the harmonic yields after the cutoff observed in panel ( a ) is related to a breakdown of the standard saddle - point approximation which occurs to the long orbits for this particular phase difference ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in panel",
    "( d ) we have plotted the real parts of the effective shifts @xmath89 as functions of the harmonic order computed for the long ( red dashed curves ) and short ( solid blue curves ) orbits in laser fields of increasing ellipticity and the same relative phase , intensity and frequency as in panels ( a),(b ) and ( c ) . the ellipticity is been increased from @xmath71 = 0 to @xmath71 = 0.3 in increments of @xmath90= 0.05 .",
    "a lighter color indicates a higher ellipticity and a vanishing shift is indicated by a horizontal black line . ]",
    "one should bear in mind , however , that for elliptically polarized fields the recollision probability of the electron decreases as @xmath71 increases , which may lead to low hhg efficiency . for two - color orthogonal fields , on the other hand , the electron has higher probability of returning to the parent molecule as the strength of the perpendicular field is increased .",
    "for this reason , it is useful to compare computations using these two types of field .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we present hhg spectra computed for two - color fields .",
    "we consider a coherent superposition of the two dominant orbits [ panel(b ) ] , together with the individual contributions @xmath86 from the long and short orbits [ panels ( a ) and ( c ) , respectively ] . we have taken the relative phase @xmath122 , which produces fairly large shifts for two - color fields .",
    "the figure shows that the shifts in the nodal - plane suppressions are much smaller than those obtained in the elliptically polarized case .",
    "for instance , for @xmath71 = 0.3 , an elliptical field may leads to shifts up to re[@xmath89 ] = 0.25 , while for a two - color field the effective shift reaches up to re[@xmath89 ] = 0.05 .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the effective shifts in fig .",
    "[ fig6](d ) with the elliptical - field examples in figs .  [ fig2](c ) and [ fig5](g ) . hence",
    ", a two - color field would be less suitable for finding the shift in an experimental setting , despite the higher probability of return .",
    "in this paper , we study high - order harmonic generation in aligned diatomic molecules in elliptical and two - color orthogonally polarized laser fields .",
    "our results show that , using fields of non - vanishing ellipticity , one may infer the angle with which an electron returns to its parent ion from hhg spectra , by relating it to distortions in the nodal - plane suppressions",
    ". while for linearly polarized fields these suppressions are well known and occur at fixed alignment angles throughout the spectra , if the fields are orthogonally polarized they are orbit- and harmonic - dependent",
    ". they can be controlled by changing the driving - field parameters , such as the relative phase , intensity and frequency ratios between the two orthogonal waves .",
    "we provide an analytic expression for this shift , which is checked against the strong - field approximation using the steepest descent method . as a testing ground ,",
    "we have employed the homo of o@xmath72 , which exhibits two orthogonal nodal planes and no two - center interference minimum for the parameter range of interest , in our computations .    within our model ,",
    "the suppressions in the spectra are caused by the recombination dipole matrix element in the sfa .",
    "the analytic condition works well for individual orbits if the nodal planes are constructed using atomic basis functions at different centers , but discrepancies arise for nodal planes in which basis functions at single centers are used .",
    "these discrepancies expose limitations in the recombination dipole matrix elements , which are overlooked for linearly polarized fields .",
    "in fact , we show that for specific alignment angles @xmath124 the suppressions in these matrix elements coincide with the nodal planes .",
    "however , this is not the complete picture and spurious structures arise for other angles . these effects occur both for the length and the velocity form of the dipole operator",
    ". however , while for the velocity form they lead to a light blurring around the analytical condition , in the length form they are very extreme and lead to exaggerated distortions .",
    "hence , the length form of the sfa should be avoided when mapping nodal planes using orthogonal fields .",
    "one should note , however , that , because the shifts are orbit dependent , they may be difficult to extract unless either the cutoff region or a particular return event can be singled out . for coherent superpositions of orbits",
    "these patterns are blurred as there are many possible return angles .",
    "this is a similar situation to that encountered in our previous publication @xcite , in which the angle of return was incorporated in the structural , two - center interference condition .",
    "this problem can however be solved through propagation , as the two dominant orbits phase match differently @xcite .",
    "this allows a high degree of control on which orbit is dominant in which spatial region @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "we proposed a method to single out shifts for one trajectory in and experimental setting .",
    "this involved using polarization gating @xcite and phase - matching conditions to remove the contributions to the hhg spectrum of one of the dominant trajectories .",
    "in particular the short orbit is very convenient for observing these effects , as it phase matches on axis , for which the hhg signal is strong .",
    "the same could be applied to the nodal - plane suppressions , for which there are two main advantages with regard to the shifted two - center interference condition .",
    "first , the distortions caused by the angle of return near nodal planes are in principle easier to identify as the suppressions are stronger .",
    "second , with the right choice of phase difference , this suppression can be shifted across the spectra .",
    "we have also found that elliptically polarized fields provide better conditions for observing the shifts experimentally , in comparison with otc fields .",
    "first , using an elliptically polarized field gives rise to a much larger shift .",
    "second , in @xcite we found that using a two - color orthogonal field caused the shift to flip sign every half cycle .",
    "this was because the parallel component @xmath125 of the vector potential would change sign every half cycle , but the perpendicular component @xmath121 would not , causing @xmath89 to change sign . in @xcite , we have avoided this problem by using a few - cycle pulse in which a specific cycle was dominant in the region of interest . for elliptical fields , however , there is no need to restrict ionization events to a single half cycle .",
    "hence , any pulse length can be employed .",
    "thus , the present work proposes a way to extract an electron s angle of return using nodal planes as tools , which is valid as long as the single - active electron and orbital approximation holds .",
    "this seems to be the case for the plateau , as there is evidence that structural effects are dominant in this region @xcite .",
