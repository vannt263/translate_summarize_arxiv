    "the study of translation invariant operators has played a decisive role in the development of euclidean harmonic analysis , as evidenced , for example , by the landmark paper @xcite by hrmander . a close connection between said translation invariant operators , the fourier transform , and distributions was uncovered , as such operators turned out to be fourier multiplier operators , or , what amounts to the same thing , convolution operators with suitable kernels .",
    "it did nt take long for the experts to seek new venues for their inquiries .",
    "one of the first was the important paper @xcite , where exciting non - euclidean phenomena were uncovered , in the setting of noncommutative harmonic analysis on a noncompact symmetric space .",
    "let us specialize to the rank one situation for the moment and define @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a certain constant associated with the symmetric space @xmath9 ( half the sum of positive roots , see section [ sec.jacobi ] ) .",
    "clerc and stein observed that an @xmath2-multiplier for the so - called spherical transform of a riemannian symmetric space of the noncompact type always has a holomorphic extension to the strip @xmath10 .",
    "several multiplier results followed the publication of @xcite and while we can not adequately recount the complete literature , let us at least mention @xcite ( the rank one case ) and @xcite for the general rank case ( where the strip @xmath10 is replaced by a tube domain @xmath11 over a certain cone in the dual of the lie algebra of the iwasawa - group @xmath12 in @xmath13 ) .",
    "more recent advances include @xcite , as well as @xcite .",
    "the latter establishes the results from @xcite in the context of chbli - trimche hypergroups ( which subsumes the spherical analysis on a rank one symmetric space , and more generally the jacobi analysis we are dealing with ) .",
    "it is well - known that an @xmath2-multiplier @xmath0 for the spherical transform on @xmath9 is determined by its boundary value on the edge on @xmath10 , and anker showed that if this boundary value satisfies a mihlin  hrmander condition of sufficiently high order , then the function is an @xmath2-multiplier .",
    "a multiplier result with less restrictive assumptions on the multiplier was obtained in @xcite ( and generalized to damek ",
    "ricci spaces in @xcite ) , and it is the purpose of the present paper to establish a ` spherical ' counterpart to both papers in the context of jacobi analysis",
    ". giulini et.al . observed that there exists a function @xmath5 , holomorphic and non - vanishing in a neighborhood of @xmath14 such that @xmath0 is still a multiplier if merely the nontangential boundary value of @xmath15 satisfies mihlin  hrmander conditions , so a class of multipliers _",
    "larger _ than the one considered by anker is thereby allowed .",
    "additional remarks are to be found in the introduction and section 2 of @xcite .",
    "in essence @xmath0 is allowed to be less regular at infinity , in particular be non - integrable .",
    "this extension was not investigated in @xcite but our results generalize to that setting .",
    "the precise formulation is as follows .",

    "here we adhere to the following notation and terminology : denote by @xmath18 the space of euclidean multipliers and by @xmath22 the space of jacobi multipliers .",
    "the _ multiplier norm _ of a function @xmath0 is by convention the operator norm of @xmath23 acting on @xmath24 , and similarly for the jacobi multipliers .",
    "these choices of norm turn @xmath18 and @xmath22 into banach spaces .",
    "let @xmath25 ( the significance of this measure is explained in section  [ sec.jacobi ] ) and denote by @xmath26 the space of all linear operators that map boundedly from @xmath27 to @xmath28 and commute with ( left ) translation .",
    "the relevant translation is introduced in equation below .",
    "we write @xmath29 instead of @xmath30 , whereas the euclidean analogue shall always be denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "it is standard that every operator @xmath32 has the form @xmath33 for a unique , suitable function @xmath34 , and where @xmath35 is a suitable convolution ( see equation  ) . by a slight abuse of terminology",
    "we say that a function @xmath34 belongs to @xmath26 if the associated convolution operator @xmath36 is @xmath37 bounded , hence in @xmath26 .",
    "the proof will follow closely the approach in @xcite and @xcite with one crucial difference ( and several smaller technical ones ) .",
    "we can not use the herz restriction principle , as we do not have any natural subgroups to which we restrict multipliers . in the present setup transference",
    "is the proper replacement , as was also utilized in both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the transference result is from @xcite and it must be pointed out that the proof of the transference theorem is much more difficult than the version used in @xcite , where group - invariance of the convolution kernel may be exploited .",
    "an important realization is that the use of the fig - talamanca ",
    "herz algebra @xmath38 in @xcite is still permissible in the jacobi setting , once we have transferred the analysis of the jacobi multipliers to an euclidean setting .",

    "estimates involving the density @xmath41 also tend to become more complicated .    a word on notation : error terms are always denoted by @xmath42 or @xmath43 , sometimes with indices , like @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this is not to imply that the different terms are somehow related , rather it is a matter of notational convenience .",
    "the notation @xmath46 is used as shorthand for an estimate of the form @xmath47 for some constant @xmath20 ; this constant @xmath20 might change from line to line .",
    "we write out the actual constants if they are important for the conclusion .",

    "it is thereby clear that @xmath71 is analytic for all @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath73 , there exists a unique solution @xmath74 to the same equation satisfying @xmath75 as @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is therefore also analytic for @xmath72 .    in analogy with the case of symmetric spaces ,",
