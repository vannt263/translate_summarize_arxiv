    "gas dynamical processes are believed to play an important role in the evolution of astrophysical systems on all length scales . smoothed particle hydrodynamics  ( sph ) is a powerful gridless particle method to solve complex fluid - dynamical problems .",
    "sph has a number of attractive features such as its low numerical diffusion in comparison to grid based methods .",
    "an adequate scenario for sph application is the unbound astrophysical problems , especially on the shock propagation  ( see , e.g. , liu & liu 2003 ) . in this way",
    ", the basic principles of the sph is written in this paper and the simulation of isothermal and adiabatic shocks are applied to test the ability of this numerical simulation to produce known analytic solutions .",
    "the program is written in fortran and is highly portable .",
    "this package supports only calculations for isothermal and adiabatic shock waves .",
    "it is possible to change ( to complete ) the program for a wide variety of applications ranging from astrophysics to fluid mechanics .",
    "the program is written in modular form , in the hope that it will provide a useful tool .",
    "i ask only that :    * if you publish results obtained using some parts of this program , please consider acknowledging the source of the package . *",
    "if you discover any errors in the program or documentation , please promptly communicate the to the author .",
    "an extremely important problem is the behavior of gases subjected to compression waves .",
    "this happens very often in the cases of astrophysical interests .",
    "for example , a small region of gas suddenly heated by the liberation of energy will expand into its surroundings .",
    "the surroundings will be pushed and compressed .",
    "conservation of mass , momentum , and energy across a shock front is given by the rankine - hugoniot conditions  ( dyson & williams 1997 ) @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 where the equation of state , @xmath3 , is used . in adiabatic case , we have @xmath4 , and for isothermal shocks , we will set @xmath5",
    ".    we would interested to consider the collision of two gas sheets with velocities @xmath6 in the rest frame of the laboratory . in this reference frame",
    ", the post - shock will be at rest and the pre - shock velocity is given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the shock front velocity .",

    "the smoothed particle hdrodynamics was invented to simulate nonaxisymmetric phenomena in astrophysics  ( lucy 1977 , gingold & monaghan 1977 ) . in this method , fluid is represented by @xmath16 discrete but extended / smoothed particles ( i.e. lagrangian sample points ) .",
    "the particles are overlapping , so that all the physical quantities involved can be treated as continues functions both in space and time .",
    "overlapping is represented by the kernel function , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the mean smoothing length of two particles @xmath19 and @xmath12 . the continuity , momentum and energy equation of particle @xmath19 are  ( monaghan 1992 ) @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the artificial viscosity between particles @xmath19 and @xmath12 , where @xmath25 is an average density , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the artificial coefficients , and @xmath28 is defined as its usual form @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "the chosen physical scales for length and time are @xmath38=3.0 \\times 10^{16 } m$ ] and @xmath39=3.0 \\times 10^{13 } s$ ] , respectively , so the velocity unit is approximately @xmath40 .",

    "there is considered two equal one dimensional sheets with extension @xmath43 $ ] , which have initial uniform density and temperature of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "particles with a positive x - coordinate are given an initial negative velocity of mach 5 , and those with a negative x - coordinate are given a mach 5 velocity in the opposite direction .",
