    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) play an important role in the life - cycle of dust in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "as snr shock waves sweep up interstellar material they heat the gas and dust , and they destroy a significant fraction of the grains , whereby refractory elements are released back into the gas phase .",
    "the shock - heated dust emits strongly at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths and is the major contributor to the total ir flux from remnants @xcite .",
    "the ir wavelength regime also contains a number of collisionally excited lines that are emitted by radiative shocks .",
    "these lines provide diagnostics for the gas - phase elemental abundances , and a comparison of refractory and non - refractory species can yield a measurement of the efficiency of grain destruction . thus , ir observations of snr shocks are crucial for studying the dust destruction process in shocks , and useful for studying the shock properties .",
    "most snrs in the galaxy are highly extincted and they can not be detected at ultraviolet or even optical wavelengths , and in those cases the ir emission offers the only way to study the radiative shocks .",
    "the cygnus loop , a middle - aged remnant , is an ideal object for the study of snr shocks .",
    "it is bright and it is nearby , so the emitting regions can be studied at high spatial resolution .",
    "it is located away from the galactic mid - plane and the foreground extinction is low , and is therefore observable in the ultraviolet and far - ultraviolet wavelength regimes .",
    "the cygnus loop exhibits a classical shell morphology at all wavelengths . in the ir , this is clearly seen in images obtained by the _ infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) _ @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out an analysis of the _ iras _",
    "data , where they decomposed the ir emission into two components , one associated with the x - ray limb of the remnant and the other with the bright optical regions .",
    "the two components correspond to non - radiative and radiative shocks , respectively .",
    "@xcite concluded that the component associated with the x - ray limb was due to emission from thermal dust .",
    "for the component associated with the optical regions , they estimated that between 10% and 100% of the emission in the broad band _ iras _",
    "images could be due to ir line emission , as opposed to dust continuum emission .",
    "these bright optical regions in the cygnus loop provide the opportunity to study the ir emission lines of a radiative shock running into atomic gas .",
    "most ir spectra of snrs to date pertain to dust emission @xcite , shocks in dense molecular clouds @xcite , or shocks in sn ejecta @xcite . by observing the interaction regions in the cygnus loop",
    ", we can study the speeds , compositions and swept - up column densities of moderate speed ( 100200 km s@xmath1  ) shock waves in interstellar regions .    in this paper , we focus on spectra of the well - studied `` xa '' region , obtained with the _ spitzer space telescope ( spitzer)_. the xa region is an indentation in the x - ray shell along the southeast perimeter of the cygnus loop .",
    "it was so named by @xcite who showed that it was an interaction region between the blast wave and a large cloud . @xcite",
    "obtained narrowband [ ] @xmath43426 images of the cygnus loop and in the xa region they identified a `` boundary shock '' - a long [ ]  filament with very little associated h@xmath5 emission . @xcite analyzed optical and ultraviolet data of the xa region and suggested that it was a protrusion on the surface of a much larger cloud . in their picture , the boundary shock is the one traveling through the cavity wall , while a slower shock is being driven into the tip of the finger , and results in bright optical and x - ray emission .",
    "based on spectra obtained with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ , @xcite showed that shocks with velocities spanning the range 120200 km s@xmath1  are present in the xa region and that they are effective at liberating silicon from grains .",
    "they also showed that the boundary shock has a velocity of @xmath6 km s@xmath1 .",

    "the extraction was performed on only one of the two nod positions .",
    "the background was subtracted , but there was no interactive removal of bad pixels . due to the remaining bad pixels ,",
    "the resulting spectra were noisier than the ones extracted using smart , but the line positions and fluxes in the two spectra matched extremely well . in this paper , we use only the spectra that were extracted using smart .",

    "the two positions selected for observation sample different shock interactions .",
    "the edge is the shock at the outer perimeter of the remnant . the [ ]  emission is strong , but the post - shock material has not yet recombined and therefore the h@xmath5 emission is undetected ( figure[fimages ] ) . the cusp is a region of complex morphology at the tip of a cloud protrusion , and both in [ ]  and in h@xmath5 emission line images .",
    "the edge spectrum contains only [ ]  and [ ]  lines , both of which are high ionization species .",
    "by contrast , the cusp spectrum is rich in lines , and includes emission from high and low ionization species , such as [ ] , [ ] , [ ]  and [ ] .",
    "spectra in the 22.526.5@xmath0 m  range are plotted for both locations in figure  [ fspec2327 ] , and the ir spectrum of the cusp is shown in figure  [ fcuspspecir ] .",
    "the line strengths in each of the spectra were measured using both a simple integration under the curve and gaussian fitting ; the two measurements are consistent to within the statistical errors , which we estimate to be about 5% for the strong lines and about 15% for the weak lines . in the edge sh spectrum the intensity of [ ] 14.33@xmath0 m  is @xmath9erg s@xmath1 @xmath3 arcsec@xmath10 . in the lh spectrum , the intensity of [ ]",

    "the high resolution modes of the irs are not optimal for detecting low - level continuum emission . in order to check for a possible contribution from the dust continuum , we compared the mips 24@xmath0mimage flux from each of the lh apertures ( after subtracting the flux from the background aperture ) with the fluxes from the irs spectra convolved with the mips 24@xmath0 m  filter response curve .",
    "we find that for both the edge and the cusp , the irs value was about 80% of the mips value .",

    "the shock models were calculated using the code originally described by @xcite with updates described in @xcite .",

    "in addition , at the temperatures where and are found in collisionally ionized plasmas , the contributions of excitation by proton collisions and of cascades from excitations to higher levels can be important .",

    "corrected for interstellar extinction , using e@xmath41=0.08 towards the cygnus loop @xcite , r@xmath42 , and the prescription of @xcite implemented in the idl astronomy library of routines , the ratio is @xmath43 .",
    "( note that we have used e@xmath41=0.16 for the cusp region  this difference will be discussed further in  5.2 , below . )",
    "the edge shock does not fill the long - high aperture , as is evident from the [ ]  image shown in fig .",

    "we find that the required values of o / ne are 8.9 and 6.3 for the lower and higher swept - up columns .",
    "the [ ]  emissivity is sensitive to the shock velocity around the 180 km s@xmath1  region , with faster shocks producing brighter [ ] emission .",
    "the shock velocity is well constrained to be 180 km s@xmath1by the ]  to ]  ratio in the fuv spectrum @xcite . the observed ]  emission",
    "would not be produced by slower shocks .",
    "therefore , we performed the calculation described above only for a faster , 190 km s@xmath1 , shock , and found that o / ne in the range 9.1 to 13.2 are required .",
    "our choice of the oxygen to neon abundance ratio for the original model was based on its success in reproducing the fuv line strengths @xcite .",
    "however , updates to the atomic rates ( see  5 , above ) have resulted in a revision of the ratio of abundances .",
    "furthermore , the forbidden optical and ir lines are not susceptible to uncertainties due to resonance scattering , and therefore the results presented here are more robust than those from the earlier study .",
    "the abundance ratio o / ne=6.3 is close to the median value of 5.89 found for a sample of 10 galactic h  ii regions @xcite .",
    "the maximum value of the ratio was 8.9 in the sample .",
    "thus , the o / ne we find for the 180 km",
    "s@xmath1  shock are in the normal range for h  ii regions , while the high values found for the 190 km s@xmath1  shock are implausible .      to compare the observations of the cusp with theoretical models , we must apply a reddening correction and scale the fluxes from the different apertures to account for the variation in surface brightness within the larger apertures .",
    "the value for e@xmath41 obtained from the optical spectrum differs from the usual value for the cygnus loop (  4.2 ) . as a check",
    ", we extracted the flux in the [ ] 3425line in the region of the _ spitzer _  sh aperture from the image presented by @xcite and compared it with the [ ] 14.33@xmath0 m  flux , and the ratio agrees with the theoretical value and e@xmath22 .    the difference in the values of e@xmath41 derived from the balmer decrement and the [ ]  lines on the one hand , and from the [ ] optical and ir lines on the other is consistent with the idea that on average the balmer lines and low - ionization lines arise from deeper within the interaction region and the high - ionization lines from the outer , less extincted regions .",
    "the reddening , e@xmath22 is the normal foreground , and the excess is local .",
    "an extended component of high ionization emission has been observed in the xa region .",
    "_ fuse _ spectra presented by @xcite shows the presence widespread @xmath451032,1038 emission , and strong  emission , comparable in strength to the ] @xmath41400 line , was observed in the area by hut @xcite .",
    "these provide some evidence for a faster shock , or for a transition layer where cool gas evaporates to join the x - ray emitting plasma that envelopes the optical filaments .",
    "however , the 56  hut aperture encompasses a lot of material outside the region observed by the other instruments considered here , so there is no compelling evidence for a faster shock contributing specifically to the spectra we have observed .",
    "an alternative explanation of the discrepancy is that we have underestimated the error in the surface brightness measured from the narrowband image , both due to the calibration and due to the placement of the sh aperture fov on the image , and the result is consistent with the higher value of reddening .    faced with these possibly contradictory results , we calculated the corrected spectrum for both values of reddening , using the @xcite extinction function with r@xmath42 .",
    "after applying the reddening correction , we accounted for the large variations of intensity within the different apertures by scaling the fluxes to match theoretical intensity ratios",
    ". ideally intensity ratios that depend only on the atomic rates , and are therefore insensitive to the model should be used .",
    "the ratio of the two ir lines of [ ]  is one such ratio . to scale the lh aperture to the sh we use the [ ] 14.33@xmath0 m  to 24.32@xmath0 m  ratio=0.82",
    "this means multiplying the lh values by a factor of 1.90 , which is plausible because the average flux in the lh aperture is presumably lower than in the sh aperture , which was placed on the intensity peak as judged by the optical images .",
    "this scaling greatly improves the agreement of the [ ] 18.71@xmath0 m  to 33.47@xmath0 m  ratio .",
    "( we use the [ ]  ratio rather then the [ ]  ratio , because the latter depends on density in the range indicated by the [ ]  optical lines . )    for the optical and uv fluxes , the only ratios available have some temperature sensitivity , so the scaling is less certain . to scale the optical flux to the sh flux we use the [ ] @xmath453870,3968 to 15.56@xmath0 m  ratio of 3.87 .",
    "since that depends on the reddening correction , the scalings differ for the two reddenings chosen ; 1.0 for e@xmath22 and 0.70 for e@xmath23 .",
    "next , we scale the uv fluxes by using the ] 1665  to [ ] 5007  ratio of 0.52 .",
    "that results in multiplying the uv fluxes by 1.90 for e@xmath22 and 1.0 for e@xmath23 .",
    "the reddening - corrected [ ] @xmath43425 intensities were not scaled , because the flux was extracted from the region corresponding to the sh aperture .",
    "the uncertainty in the placement of the aperture on the image gives a 7% uncertainty , and @xcite quote a photometric uncertainty of 30% .",
    "finally , we normalized the relative fluxes to h@xmath46 , for comparison with the models .",
    "the scaling for the different apertures largely cancels out the difference in reddening correction , so that for the two values of e@xmath41 , the scaled , normalized relative fluxes differed by less than 20% for all lines except [ ] @xmath43425 . in table  [ tblflux ] along with the observed fluxes , we present the reddening corrected fluxes only for the case of e@xmath23 because of its better agreement with the model balmer decrement .      the line fluxes predicted by a set of shock models are presented in table  [ tblflux ] .",
    "we chose five models to illustrate the sensitivity to shock speed and density .",
    "these models use the following abundance set : h=12.00 ; he=10.93 ; c=8.52 ; n=7.96 ; o=8.70 ; ne=8.09 ; mg=7.52 ; si=7.60 ; s=7.20 ; ar=6.90 ; ca=6.30 ; fe=7.60 and ni=6.30 .",

    "the shock velocities , pre - shock densities and pre - shock magnetic fields used in these models are presented in table  [ tblshocks ] , along with values of the swept - up column densities and temperatures where the models were truncated .    *",
    "shock speed : * the range of shock speeds 145155 km s@xmath1  best reproduces the line fluxes from the wide range of ionization states that are observed .",
    "shocks that are outside this velocity range produce far too little or far too much of high ionization lines such as , , [ ] and [ ]  ( although the permitted lines are so strongly attenuated by resonance scattering in the shocked gas and in the ism that they only constrain the lower end of the range ) . the specific range was chosen to match the 1640  line under the assumption that helium is singly ionized in the pre - shock medium .",
    "* density and magnetic field : * the observed ratio of @xmath47 between the components of the [ ]  doublet (  4.2 ) implies an electron density in the emitting gas in the range 100250@xmath26 .",
    "the density in the [ ] zone depends upon the pre - shock density and on the maximum compression in the post - shock gas , which in turn depends on the driving pressure of the shock and on the pre - shock magnetic field and cosmic ray pressure .",
    "these non - thermal contributions to the pressure limit the compression of the gas as it cools from the post - shock temperature near 260,000 k to the [ ]  formation temperature near 10,000 k @xcite .",
    "the rather low values of the pre - shock magnetic field for most of the models were chosen in order to reach the observed density range with a pre - shock density and ram pressure comparable to those determined for other positions in the xa region .",
    "for the models shown , the predicted [ ]  doublet ratio agrees with the observed value for m145 , m150 and m155a . however , the predictions are too low for models m155b and m155c , indicating that the density is too high .",
    "on the other hand , observed ratio of [ ] 22.92@xmath0 m  to [ ] 25.98@xmath0 m  is about 0.4 , while the lower density models ( m145 , m150 and m155a ) predict ratios of about 0.1 .",
    "even the higher density models ( m155b and m155c ) only predict ratios of 0.2 , while their [ s ii ] doublet ratios are clearly at odds with the observed value .",
    "the lower densities are consistent with those derived at other shocks in the cygnus loop , including several positions in the xa region , while the [ ]  ratio would suggest a density of 2000@xmath26 , 10 to 20 times higher than found at other positions .",
    "the easiest explanation for the discrepancy is an error in atomic rates , but a physical explanation might be that the [ ]  arises from a separate region , such as a slow shock that is heavily reddened and therefore contributes little to the [ ]  lines .    *",
    "shock completeness : * the models in table  [ tblflux ] are cut off at swept - up columns log @xmath48 = 18.0 to 18.1 .",
    "the temperatures obtained at cut - off are between 7000 and 8000k ( table  [ tblshocks ] ) , which is required by the temperature of the [ ]  zone (  4.2 ) .",
    "although a somewhat larger range of cutoffs is allowable , too much of a deviation would lead to unacceptable values for line ratios such as [ ] /h@xmath49 and [ ] /h@xmath49 .",
    "for the densities and magnetic fields used , the gas has cooled for between 500 and 1000 years .",
    "a 400 km s@xmath1x - ray producing shock will travel ahead by the difference in velocities times that age , or about 100  in a thousand years , which is consistent with the position of the edge filament . the observed separation is 135 , which lies within the uncertainty in projection effects and the changing speeds of the shocks as they pass through regions of different density .",
    "the parameters in the shock model have been constrained largely by the uv and optical spectra .",
    "if we disregard the lines strongly affected by resonance scattering , and [ ] @xmath43425 , for which the measurement and scaling is discrepant compared to the other lines , then the shock model predictions match the observations to within 50% , except for ] @xmath41750 and [ ] @xmath47138 , and in most cases to within 25% .",
    "reducing the rather uncertain abundance of ar by a factor of about two would bring the [ ]  predictions into agreement with the observed value , without affecting any other line strengths .    in fig .",
    "[ fmodobs ] , the ratio of the flux predicted by model m150 to the observed , dereddened value is plotted against wavelength for the lines listed in table  [ tblflux ] .",
    "the top , middle and bottom plots show the uv , optical and ir lines , respectively . it should be noted that no distinction is made between strong and weak lines in the plots .",
    "so , for instance , the match between models and observation for the weak [ ]  lines in the ir spectrum is actually much better than the plot seems to imply , as can be seen by examining table  [ tblflux ] .",
    "we now turn to an examination of the ir lines , focusing on models m145 , m150 and m155a , since the other two ( m155b and m155c ) do not predict the observed optical [ ]  doublet ratio .",
    "the [ ]  lines are most sensitive to the shock velocity , and are best matched by the 155 km s@xmath1  shock .",
    "all models predict [ ]  fluxes that are higher than the observation  a factor of 1.3 for the 145 km s@xmath1shock and 2.0 for the 155 km s@xmath1  shock .",
    "the models reproduce the correct [ ]  line fluxes , with the 150 km s@xmath1  model providing the best match .",
    "in contrast , the models consistently predict only about half the observed [ ]  flux .    the [ ]  fluxes predicted by the model are significantly higher than the observed value . reducing the si abundance by a factor of about 2.5 , as expected from depletion onto grains , would bring them into agreement . however , the line fluxes predicted by the models are also sensitive to the column density cut - off , since the [ ] emission would extend far into the cooling zone .",
    "the ratios among the [ ]  lines predicted by the models are in agreement with the observed values , but the absolute fluxes are higher . as with silicon , the match between models and observation would be improved for the [ ]  lines with fe abundances reduced by a factor of about two .",
    "the models correctly predict the [ ] line fluxes , and therefore too low a ratio between [ ]  and [ ]  line strengths .",
    "the ratio is sensitive to the photoionization rate of fe@xmath50 , the recombination rate of fe@xmath51 , and especially to the charge transfer rates , which we have taken from @xcite as well as to the cutoff column density .",
    "the models assumed solar abundances for si and fe , while those elements should be almost entirely depleted onto dust grains in the ism .",
    "reductions by factors of 2.5 and 2 , respectively , still imply that about 4050% of these elements have been returned to the gas phase .",
    "the ratios of the uv lines of c iii ] and si iii ] to the o iii ] line also indicate only modest depletion .",
    "this efficient liberation of refractory elements from grains is a little surprising , since only about 2040% of the silicon and carbon are returned to the gas phase at a swept - up column of @xmath52  @xmath3 in the faster x - ray producing shock in the ne cygnus loop studied by @xcite .",
    "the sputtering rates are greatly reduced at the lower temperatures in 150 km s@xmath1  shocks , but grain - grain collisions shatter the dust particles , producing small grains that are more vulnerable to sputtering .",
    "@xcite find that 10% to 30% of the mass of graphite and silicates in grains is returned to the gas phase for shock speeds below 150 km s@xmath1 , so the spectra imply a higher dust destruction efficiency .",
    "however , the behavior of grains in high speed collisions is uncertain .",
    "the pair of lines [ ]  and [ ]  present an interesting puzzle , which may have some important consequences for our understanding of the xa region .",
    "separately considered , the model predictions are in fairly good agreement with the observations .",
    "however , the [ ] to [ ]  flux ratio is always less than 1 . to match the predicted flux ratio of about 1.3",
    ", the models would need to be truncated at unacceptably low values of swept - up column density .",
    "the observed flux ratio can be explained if an additional source of photoionization is invoked .",
    "the extra photoionization would also be helpful in explaining the strength of the [ ]  line and possibly the [ ] to [ ]  flux ratio as well .",
    "the driving pressures of the shocks m145 , m150 , m155a , m155b and m155c , n@xmath53 , are @xmath54@xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59@xmath26 ( km s@xmath1)@xmath60 , respectively .",
    "these values are 3 to 10 times higher than the driving pressure found for the edge shock , @xmath61 @xmath26(km",
    "s@xmath1)@xmath60 , by @xcite . the pressure derived is proportional to the pre - shock density , which in turn is proportional to the assumed distance to the cygnus loop .",
    "@xcite assumed 540  pc @xcite , but the upper limit to the distance , 640  pc @xcite , or an even greater value , is supported by proper motion measurements of the non - radiative shocks in the ne cygnus loop @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the reported errors on the density allow it to be about 30% higher . however , even if the driving pressure for the edge shock is 2 times the value reported by @xcite , that for the cusp is higher by a factor between 1.5 and 5 .    this may not be a problem since some pressure variations within the xa region due to the interaction of dense clouds are likely .",
    "we note that if the cosmic ray population in the galaxy were simply compressed in the shock , it could provide a substantial fraction of the pressure support in the [ ]  emitting region for densities ( and therefore compression ratios ) at the upper end of the range allowed by the [ ]  line ratio .",
    "however , that assumes that the cosmic rays do not diffuse away during the cooling process .",
    "the comparison of the cusp spectrum , from 1240  to 35@xmath0mwith models of radiative shocks , shown in table  [ tblflux ] illustrates both the usefulness of the models and their limitations .",
    "there are many ways in which the models can be wrong .",
    "they assume steady flow as the gas cools until it reaches a sharp cutoff column density .",
    "that assumption can be violated by thermal instability in the cooling region @xcite , but that instability becomes strong at speeds above 150 km s@xmath1 , and it takes more than one cooling time to develop .",
    "it is also violated if the density , and therefore shock speed , varies significantly over the distance in which the shock sweeps up the observed column , in this case about 0.1 pc , and that is very likely at the edge of a cloud . in that case",
    "the derived shock speed , which is determined by the highest ionization states observed , is near the current shock speed , while lower ionization species may have passed through a faster shock earlier in its evolution .",
    "other weaknesses of the simple model include the possibility of mixing with the high temperature gas that produces x - rays , the possible effects of thermal conduction , the neglect of dust and the gradual liberation of refractory elements , the uncertainties in atomic rates and the approximate treatment of radiative transfer .",
    "weaknesses in the comparison to observations include the reddening correction uncertainty , and the scaling for the different apertures of the different instruments .",
    "we note that a single shock model could not be expected to match all the line intensities even if the apertures used in the different observations covered exactly the same area on the sky , because the echelle spectrum shown by @xcite shows that there are two separate shocks along the line of sight , redshifted and blueshifted by about 30 km s@xmath1 .    in spite of all the limitations described above , a simple model of a 145155 km s@xmath1  shock is a reasonable explanation for the observations , since it matches all the observed lines to within a factor of 2 ( except ] , where the discrepancy is slightly higher ) and most to within about 25% .",
    "although the match between observations and model predictions is reasonable , the agreement could be improved with some tweaking of model parameters , particularly elemental abundances and cutoff column densities .",
    "however , the parameter changes would probably lie within the uncertainties .",
    "the fact that such a simple model comes close to matching the observations may result from the fact that to first order it is simply conservation of energy in gas that cools radiatively from the shock temperature .",
    "the set of ir lines detected in the cusp spectra are useful diagnostics of snr shocks .",
    "this is particularly true of the lines from the singly and doubly ionized species , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] and [ ] , all of which can be produced in shocks with speeds as low as 80 km s@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "we compare the ir line fluxes from the cusp region with those measured in other snrs . in table",
    "[ tblsnrs ] we have assembled measurements from the published literature .",

    "[ tblsnrs ] we have arranged the remnants in order of increasing surface brightness of the sum of these two lines . according to this measure , the cygnus loop xa region is the faintest of the sample .",

    "the ratio of [ ] 15.56@xmath0 m  to [ ] 12.81@xmath0 m  in the xa region is 1.3 , which is the highest value among all the remnants .",
    "the ratio is 1.2 in 3c396 , 0.9 in rcw 103 , and lies between 0.1 and 0.5 for all other remnants .",
    "shocks with velocities in the 80120 km s@xmath1  range produce [ ]  to [ ]  ratios between 0.1 and 0.3 when the pre - shock medium is in photoionization equilibrium , and between 0.5 and 0.9 when it is completely ionized @xcite .",
    "we have explained the higher than predicted ratio in the cusp spectrum by invoking an incomplete , @xmath62 km s@xmath1  shock .",
    "however , an alternative explanation is that faster shocks in the vicinity as well as the hot x - ray emitting plasma provide photoionizing radiation that increases the [ ]  to [ ]  flux ratio above the values expected for only shock excitation .    the [ ]",

    "the [ ]  and [ ]  zones in the post - shock flow are nearly co - extensive and therefore the relative abundances of ne and s influence the flux ratio of [ ] 15.56@xmath0 m  and [ ] 18.71@xmath0 m .",
    "the ionization potential of s@xmath51 ( 34.83ev ) is lower than that of ne@xmath50 ( 40.96ev ) and therefore photoionization can also play a role in determining the flux ratio of [ ]  to [ ] . this trend is detected in the sample of remnants .",
    "for the three objects with the lowest [ ]  to [ ]  ratios , i.e. @xmath63 , the [ ] to [ ]  ratios lie between 0.5 and 1.4 .",
    "for all the remaining objects , except one , where the [ ]  to [ ]  ratio span the range 0.21.3 , the [ ]  to [ ]  ratios lie between 2.4 and 4.4 .",

    "the ratio [ ] 10.51@xmath0mto [ ] 18.71@xmath0 m  is about 0.06 , which is much lower than for the xa region , where the ratio is about 0.4 .",
    "overall , we conclude that the other spectra listed in table 4 pertain to slower shocks , than the one at the cusp , probably because the bright regions chosen for observation are shocks in denser clouds .",
    "the cygnus loop xa region provides a rich set of shock excited emission lines across a broad wavelength range .",
