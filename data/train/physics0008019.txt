    "the concept of quantum coherence and interference plays an important role in resonant nonlinear optics and spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "coherent coupling of laser radiation with multilevel quantum schemes has been used to manipulate energy level populations , nonlinear - optical response , refraction and absorption of a resonance medium @xcite .",
    "much attention has been shown to four - wave mixing ( fwm ) processes with maximal coherence on a raman transition @xcite based on the effect of coherence population trapping ( cpt ) @xcite , which allows a dramatic increase of conversion efficiency . in far - from - degenerate schemes , substantial doppler broadening of the resonant quantum transitions gives rise to inhomogeneous coupling of the driving fields with the atoms in different velocity intervals . therefore , under relatively low intensities , only a small fraction of the atoms can be concurrently coupled with both the fields driving the raman transition and , as a consequence , the cpt conditions can not be fulfilled for the entire thermal velocity interval . this fundamental limitation in resonant nonlinear optics of gases substantially reduces the efficiency of the corresponding processes .",
    "the common methods of doppler - free ( df ) nonlinear spectroscopy entail ladder energy level schemes and equal frequency counter - propagating beams .",
    "this usually leads to large detunings from the intermediate resonance and consequently a decrease of the nonlinear susceptibility . besides that",
    ", the method can not be applied to fwm processes in ladder schemes , due to the phase - matching requirements , and in raman - type schemes due to the difference in frequencies of the coupled fields .",
    "the technique , allowing one to overcome this obstacle by compensating for doppler frequency shifts with light - induced ac - stark shifts and thus enabling one to couple a wide velocity interval concurrently , has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "this was developed in further publications @xcite and most recently in publications @xcite addressing fwm under conditions where cpt is not possible . related effects in the absorption index",
    "were also investigated recently @xcite .",
    "we further mean cpt as the process where two driving fields form nearly equal velocity - averaged populations of the levels at raman transitions , while the velocity - averaged population of the intermediate state is much less .",
    "along with this absorption and amplification indices for the couple fields reach minimum . on the other hand coherence in the raman transition , which is origin of fwm ,",
    "approaches maximum .",
    "that allows one to accomplish a maximum of the conversion efficiency .",
    "the conditions to achieve cpt may differ from those required for the df raman - type resonance .",

    "<S> new feasibity of coherent quantum control of four - wave mixing processes in a resonant doppler - broadened medium are studied . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a technique which enables one to enhance the quantum efficiency of nonlinear optical conversion . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , it allows one to decrease the required intensities of the fundamental beams compared to those necessary in the approach based on coherent population trapping . </S>",
    "<S> the major outcomes of the analysis are illustrated with numerical simulation addressed within a practical medium . </S>"
