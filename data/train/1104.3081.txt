    "simulating the evolution of many - body quantum systems on classical computers is a complex task , which is believed to be intrinsically beyond the capabilities of classical computation @xcite . while in the classical case the number of degrees of freedom scales linearly with the particle number the computational complexity in treating interacting many - particle quantum systems increases drastically due to an exponential growth of the hilbert space dimension .",
    "one way to overcome this difficulty is to mimic the behavior of the quantum system of interest in an analogue physical system whose degrees of freedom are well accessible and controllable @xcite .",
    "initializing this system in a desired quantum state and measuring its properties after a given time is then effectively equivalent to having performed a simulation of the quantum evolution .",
    "such quantum simulators are currently developed for several physical platforms ( see @xcite for a recent overview ) , ranging from atomic systems @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , implementations based on nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , to photonic devices @xcite .    one paradigmatic system for the simulation of many - body quantum physics are gases of ultracold alkali atoms trapped in optical lattices , where the underlying hamiltonian parameters such as the hopping rate or onsite interaction strength energies of atoms can be controlled and tuned externally ( see fig .

    "while the afore - mentioned ultracold atoms in optical lattices typically realize bosonic or fermionic hubbard - type hamiltonians with short - range interactions , trapped ions for instance naturally offer the possibility to study interacting spin models . in general , it is difficult to use analogue quantum simulators for the study of many - body systems with interactions , that differ considerably from the natural , physically present ( one- and two - body ) interactions underlying the quantum simulator . for the simulation of exotic models involving certain constraints and higher - order interactions ,",

    "the central building block of our simulator is a mesoscopic rydberg gate which relies on electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) and the strong and long - ranged interaction of neutral atoms excited to rydberg states @xcite .",

    "furthermore , we make use of a rydberg state @xmath23 in each ensemble atom that is coupled to the intermediate @xmath22 state with a laser of rabi frequency @xmath21 . the external laser fields are chosen such that there is a large detuning @xmath24 from the @xmath22 level , such that this state is only virtually populated . however , the hyperfine ground states and the rydberg state are in two - photon resonance .    with this setup",
    "the gate operation is performed by a sequence of three laser pulses that is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse2 ] : we start by applying a @xmath25 pulse on the control atom which transforms its qubit state @xmath26 to @xmath27 . in the next step",

    "note that during the second laser pulse ( raman transfer ) @xmath21 and therefore also @xmath34 are time - dependent functions .",
    "the interaction term @xmath35 is in fact state - dependent and accounts for the state of the control atom : in an ideal situation we have @xmath36 for the control atom in @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse]a ) while for the control atom in @xmath18 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : pulse]b ) we have a dominant rydberg interaction , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "the antisymmetric state @xmath38 is a zero energy eigenstate of the hamiltonian .",
    "this dark state will thus be unaffected by the dynamics .",
    "let us now look at the situation in which the control atom is in state @xmath10 ( fig .",

    "[ fig : pulse2 ] have no effect .",

    "the ensemble is hence effectively transparent for the raman laser .",
    "imperfections of this adiabatic passage arise from landau - zener transitions to the non - zero energy eigenstate @xcite .    in the case of the control atom starting in @xmath11",
    "the first @xmath25-pulse will effectuate a transfer to the rydberg state @xmath18 and the strong interaction between the rydberg levels @xmath35 will change the outcome of the raman laser sequence . for the sake of simplicity we assume @xmath37 . here",
    "the rydberg levels of the ensemble atoms will not take part in the dynamics as they are far off - resonant ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse]b ) . here",
    "the time evolution of the ensemble atoms follows the hamiltonian @xmath46 .",
    "then , by choosing the pulse shape of @xmath20 ( @xmath47 ) such that @xmath48 the system will undergo the transformation ( or raman transfer ) @xmath49 expressing this transformation in the original states @xmath12 and @xmath13 results in @xmath50 which is the desired operation up to a trivial phase factor , which can be corrected by choosing suitable phases of the laser fields . finally , the second @xmath25-pulse de - excites the control atom .",
    "combining the two scenarios outlined above establishes a way to control a not operation on the qubit states of the ensemble atoms conditioned on the state of the control atom , effectively realizing the cnot@xmath14 gate ( [ eq : cnot ] ) . in the next subsections we will make extensive use of this gate when implementing digital quantum simulation schemes for spin models ( with many - body interactions ) .",
    "before we proceed , however , we want to briefly discuss issues relevant to the experimental implementation .",
    "first of all , we have neglected in our considerations the interaction among ensemble atoms .",
    "this is in general unjustified since the ensemble atoms are in the course of the gate sequence excited to rydberg states which strongly interact . in a situation in which the control atom is initially in @xmath11 and hence is excited to a rydberg state this does not constitute a major problem since the rydberg state of the ensemble atoms is shifted far out of resonance and therefore is not excited . in the opposite situation ( control atom in state @xmath10 ) the ensemble - ensemble interaction is however expected to modify the working of the gate considerably .",
    "indeed , one finds that in this case the state of the ensemble atoms can no longer be described by a tensor product of dark states @xcite .",
    "instead one finds that the initial state , e.g. @xmath51 is written as a sum of dark and  grey  states which acquire a dynamical phase shift ( with respect to the dark states ) that in the limit of infinite ensemble - ensemble interaction is proportional to @xmath52 $ ] @xcite . in order to keep the fidelity of the gate high this shift has to be kept small",
    "this means the higher the number of qubits that are to be entangled , the smaller the ratio @xmath32 .",
    "however , at the same time the raman transfer has to be carried out at a time much shorter than the lifetime of the atomic rydberg states , that is typically on the order of @xmath53s .",
    "this requires a very strong coupling and also strong raman lasers .",
    "one can show that the gate as presented here can implement an entangling operation on a timescale of @xmath54s . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have explicitly shown that fidelities @xmath55 can be achieved for @xmath56 ensemble atoms located at a distance @xmath57 m from the control atom .",
    "the main limitation to the fidelity is given by the available laser power . in order to achieve high fidelities also for a larger number of ensemble atoms one has to ensure @xmath58 .",
    "this choice suppresses deteriorating effects caused by the interaction among ensemble atoms excited to rydberg states @xcite .",
    "further consequence that arises from gate imperfections on the desired quantum simulation are analyzed towards the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : kitaev ] .      in the following",
    ", we will use the mesoscopic rydberg gate as building block for the digital quantum simulation @xcite of spin hamiltonians .",
    "we will at first discuss kitaev s toric code whose hamiltonian contains many - body interaction . despite the seemingly complicated structure this model is rather simple to implement as its hamiltonian contains no non - commuting parts .",
    "the second example concerns the two - dimensional heisenberg model and as a third example we discuss the digital simulation of lattice fermions .",
    "the latter can be mapped onto an effective spin hamiltonian with six - body interaction terms .      in kitaev s toric code model ,",

    "this model is paradigmatic for a whole class of so - called stabilizer codes @xcite .",

    "the index @xmath62 labels the plaquettes / stars and the four @xmath63-operators act on the spins located at the corners of the corresponding square ( see fig . [",
    "fig : storic ] ) .",
    "besides its initially envisioned use as a quantum memory , this model has recently received considerable attention in the context of quantum simulation @xcite .     and star terms @xmath64 . ]",
    "the operators @xmath65 and @xmath64 are stabilizer operators with eigenvalues @xmath66 .",
    "the model can be solved exactly , as all plaquette and star terms of the hamiltonian mutually commute .",
    "the global ground state @xmath67 is at the same time the ground state of each of the operators @xmath65 and @xmath64 : @xmath68 for all plaquettes and stars , respectively . for periodic boundary conditions on a torus",
    "the stabilizers satisfy the relations @xmath69 and @xmath70 . for a system of @xmath9 atoms",
    "there are @xmath71 independent stabilizers .",
    "consequently , the ground state manifold of the system will be four - fold degenerate .",
    "for an experimentally more accessible situation of flat two - dimensional lattice structures , the number of holes in the 2d lattice determines the ground state degeneracy .",
    "excitations of the toric code hamiltonian can be of two types : violations of the stabilizer constraints of either @xmath65 operators (  magnetic charges \" ) or @xmath72 terms (  electric charges \" ) .",
    "they have an energy gap of @xmath73 as every violation will affect two stars or plaquettes , respectively .",
    "in the following we will illustrate these excitations for the magnetic charges , but due to the symmetry of the hamiltonian the situation is identical for the electric charges .    flipping",
    "a single spin will create two magnetic charges located on adjacent plaquettes , see fig .",
    "[ fig : charges ] . by flipping a different spin on one of the adjacent",
    "plaquettes the excitations are effectively moved .",
    "the excitations are no longer quasi - local , but must be described by a string operator involving the path along which the charge has been moved . by flipping several spins",
    "we also may move a magnetic charge around an electric charge ; due to the non - commutativity of @xmath74 and @xmath75 the state will eventually pick up a phase of @xmath25 . this behavior shows that the quasiparticles describing magnetic or electric charges neither have bosonic nor fermionic character as in both cases one would expect to recover the identity once the particle had been returned to its initial position . hence , one calls such particles with exotic statistics `` anyons '' related to their potential to pick up `` any '' phase under particle exchange . while the realizations of systems exhibiting anyonic excitations is interesting in itself ,",
    "the anyon dynamics has direct consequences on the ground state cooling discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : cool ] .        since the stabilizer operators @xmath65 and @xmath64 mutually commute no trotter errors occur and the time - evolution operator for a time step @xmath5 is exactly given by @xmath76 and we need to focus only on the case of a single plaquette or star .",
    "the extension to the entire lattice then follows naturally from iterating over all plaquettes and stars .",
    "note that it is possible to parallelize many of these operations by partitioning the system into a few sublattices of piecewise independent atoms .    during each timestep of the digital simulation",
    "we want the dynamics of the plaquette to be governed by the time evolution operator @xmath77 . in the regime of single site addressability , selecting a single plaquette is achieved by focusing the laser pulses which are required for the gate only on the atoms participating in the dynamics of this plaquette . in ref .",
    "@xcite a simulation scheme was suggested where additional ancillary  control \" atoms were used to effectively mediate four - body interactions between the four plaquette spins .",
    "here , we propose an alternative approach which works without ancillary atoms . instead one of the four plaquette atoms ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : storic ] ) will take the role of the control atom @xmath78 .",
    "this situation requires a focussing of the raman and control lasers exclusively on the remaining three atoms of the plaquette .",
    "this can either be achieved by an appropriate shaping of these laser beams or alternatively by addressing the three atoms sequentially between the excitation and deexcitation of the control atom .",
    "we can then decompose @xmath79 as @xmath80 where @xmath81 describes the mesoscopic rydberg gate , @xmath82 and the single qubit rotation @xmath83 imprints a phase of @xmath84 onto the control atom .",

    "the actual configuration of the spins is not important . in the first step of the gate sequence ( [ eq : kitaev_gate ] )",
    "the information of the state of three plaquette atoms is mapped on the control atom .",
    "now the control atom is manipulated , i.e. a state - dependent rotation is carried out and the initial mapping is reversed .",
    "the timescale of this process is essentially set by the speed of the mesoscopic rydberg gate as single qubit rotations can be carried out quickly and reliably .",
    "using experimentally realistic parameters , we find an effective interaction strength that can be on the order of several hundred khz @xcite .",
    "let us now briefly investigate the effects of imperfections on the quantum simulator . as mentioned above , a possible error source is the residual rydberg interaction between the ensemble atoms during the mesoscopic gate , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion . in the presence of such a coherent error",
    "we can write the mesoscopic gate as @xmath89 here , we have factored out the dependence on the imprinted phase @xmath90 to allow for a consistent expansion . the perfect gate @xmath81 then follows in the limit @xmath91 , with the hermitian operator @xmath92 acting on the entire plaquette except for the control atom . expanding @xmath93 up to first order in @xmath90 we obtain @xmath94 which corresponds to the coherent dynamics under the modified hamiltonian @xmath95 .",

    "this can be done , e.g , by starting in the lower left corner , moving to the lower right corner , go up one site , move to the left , and so on until the entire lattice has been scanned over .",
    "then , the presence of a fermion on site @xmath104 corresponds to the presence of a down spin .",
    "conversely , an empty site in the fermionic picture translates into a spin up particle .",
    "note that for spin @xmath113 fermions , one has to replace each fermion by two spin @xmath113 particles to encode all four possible combinations on each site .",
    "let us now look at how the operators in the fermi - hubbard hamiltonian transform . clearly , the on - site interaction results in interactions of the form @xmath122 .",
    "on the other hand , the hopping terms become @xmath123 with the string operator @xmath124 acting on the sites between @xmath104 and @xmath125 .",
    "if we consider hopping in the horizontal direction , we see that within our enumeration scheme the string operators drop out and the resulting spin operators remain local . however , this is not true in the vertical direction .",
    "there , we are left with non - vanishing string operators that run across the entire width of the lattice and consequently describe a highly nonlocal interaction .",
    "this obstacle can be overcome by introducing auxiliary degrees of freedom as shown in ref .",
    "such degrees of freedom are constituted by a fermion field @xmath126 that is prepared in the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath127 with the mutually commuting projectors @xmath128 and @xmath129 partitioning the lattice into directed graphs , see fig .",
    "[ fig : aux ] .",
    "the ground state of @xmath130 is given by the condition @xmath131 for all @xmath132 . by replacing the vertical hoppings in the fermi - hubbard hamiltonian by @xmath133 it",
    "is possible to turn them into local spin operators when the jordan - wigner transformation is applied .",
    "the price one has to pay for this decoupling is that the resulting hamiltonian contains six - body interactions @xcite . including all degrees of freedom",
    ", the hamiltonian is of the form    @xmath134    where we have moved to a two - dimensional notation for the lattice .",
    "are defined . ]    for an experimental realization one needs to implement four spin @xmath113 particles on every site of the original fermionic model .",
    "this could be realized either by stacking up the square lattice in four layers or by being able to address all particles per site individually , e.g. , by choosing different hyperfine states .",
    "note that the six - body interactions can again be mapped on the familiar @xmath135 form by applying local @xmath85 rotations on the spins involving @xmath136 . as an example , let us demonstrate the digital simulation of the fermion hopping term @xmath137 , which transform into @xmath138 the two terms @xmath139 and @xmath140 can be implemented sequentially according to the suzuki - trotter formula eq .",
    "( [ eq : trotter ] ) .",
    "the time - evolution according to @xmath139 can be simulated by the gate sequence @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the hadamard gate , which interchanges @xmath86 and @xmath75 and the phase shift @xmath143 relates the duration of each timestep @xmath5 to the coupling constant @xmath6 . the term @xmath140 can be implemented analogously , by including local gates interchanging @xmath74 and @xmath144 on the sites @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "while the experimental requirements for the implementations of non - commuting three - body and six - body interaction terms is certainly challenging , this example illustrates the principle power of a digital quantum simulator . by using",
    "specially tailored many - body gates it might be possible to group several terms of the hamiltonian together and thus reduce the number of required gate operations .",
    "so far , we have discussed the coherent simulation of spin and fermion lattice models .",
    "what we have left aside is the preparation of the initial state for this simulated dynamics .",
    "typically , one is not interested in dynamics of arbitrary initial states , but rather in the behavior of a certain class of states , often those with low energy with respect to the simulated hamiltonian .",
    "one possibility would be to adiabatically follow the ground state from an experimentally accessible initial state ; for example , in analog simulation of lattice models with cold atoms , the system is first cooled to quantum degeneracy , with the lattice being ramped up adiabatically afterwards . here , we follow a different route : we engineer the interaction with a dissipative environment in such a way that the resulting dynamics cools the system into the many - body ground state of the hamiltonian of interest @xcite .",
    "with such a dissipative element the dynamics is no longer unitary , but can be described by a quantum master equation for the system density operator @xmath147 , which is of the form @xmath148+\\sum_i\\gamma_i \\left(c_i\\rho c_i^{\\dagger}-\\frac{1}{2}{\\left\\{c_i^{\\dagger}c_i,\\rho\\right\\}}\\right),\\ ] ] and where the rates @xmath149 control the strength of the dissipation .",
    "the goal is then to engineer the jump operators @xmath150 in such a way that the only stationary states of the master equation correspond to the groun dstates of the hamiltonian of interest .",
    "note that this hamiltonian does not necessarily correspond to the hamiltonian @xmath151 generating the coherent dynamics in the master equation .",
    "in fact , we will study the case of purely dissipative dynamics with @xmath152 in the following .",
    "let us focus again on the toric code whose coherent simulation was already discussed sec .",
    "[ sec : kitaev ] .",
    "in contrast to the implementation of the coherent dynamics we will no longer use one of the atoms of each plaquette or star as the control particle . instead , we add control atoms to the interstitial spaces of our lattice as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : tcc ] . in our cooling scheme these control atoms will be optically pumped , and therefore provide the coupling to the dissipative environment needed for our quantum state preparation .     state . ]    as demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : kitaev ] the global ground state of the toric code is at the same time the ground state of each plaquette or star .",
    "kitaev s toric code falls into the class of frustration - free hamiltonians , where the energy of each term can be minimized independently .",
    "we can therefore perform the cooling to the ground state of each plaquette or star . as in the coherent case we first focus on the case of a single plaquette @xmath65 . here",
    "the local hamiltonian is given by @xmath153 with the spectrum of @xmath65 constituted by two eightfold degenerate sectors with eigenvalues @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "it is therefore convenient to denote the states by @xmath156 , where @xmath66 refers to the eigenvalue of @xmath65 and @xmath157 labels the different states within the degenerate manifold .",
    "the preparation of the ground state sector can be achieved by pumping the plaquette into any superposition or mixture of @xmath154 eigenstates .",
    "this is realized by choosing a four - body quantum jump operator of the form @xmath158 where @xmath159 acts on an arbitrary spin @xmath104 of the four plaquette spins . to understand the action of this jump operator , it is instructive to split it into two parts .",
    "first , the `` interrogation '' part @xmath160 checks whether the system is already in the correct eigenstate .",
    "applied to any @xmath154 eigenstate ( @xmath161 ) the jump operator vanishes and the ground state manifold is left unchanged . however , for @xmath162 the second `` pump '' part @xmath136 flips the sign of @xmath65 and consequently transforms any state @xmath163 of the excited state manifold directly to the corresponding state @xmath164 in the ground state manifold .",
    "the implementation of this jump operator in terms of a gate sequence essentially follows this picture .",
    "the auxiliary control atom is initially prepared in the state @xmath165 .",
    "then , the many - body eigenstate of @xmath166 is mapped onto the control atom by the gate sequence @xmath167 where @xmath168 is a local @xmath85 rotation acting on the control atom and @xmath81 is the mesoscopic rydberg gate ( [ eq : cnot ] ) . the mapping @xmath169 can be described as @xmath170 after this mapping we can therefore conditionally manipulate the many - body states of the plaquette by a conditional operation based on the state of the control atom .",
    "we perform a controlled spin flip onto one of the four system spins , given by @xmath171 here , the angle @xmath172 controls the probability with which a spin flip from the @xmath155 to the @xmath154 eigenspace is realized ( see below ) .",
    "the two - qubit gate @xmath173 can be implemented based on the mesocopic rydberg gate .",
    "finally , we reverse the mapping by applying the inverse gate sequence @xmath174 .",
    "then , we find that the control atom remains in the @xmath11 state every time @xmath175 induces a spin flip , i.e.  in general it remains entangled with the four plaquette spins .",
    "consequently , before using the control atom for the next cooling step , optical pumping to the @xmath10 state is required to reinitialize the control atom in @xmath10 such that it factors out from the dynamics of the plaquette spins .",
    "it is this dissipative element that provides the necessary ingredient that allows one to remove entropy from the system . for @xmath107 we can perform an expansion of the dynamical map describing the evolution of the density operator @xmath147 , i.e. , @xmath176 with the jump operators",
    "@xmath177 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jump ] ) and the cooling rate @xmath178 .",

    "compared to the simulation timestep @xmath5 , essentially all anyons are removed from the system and the ground state energy @xmath193 is reached asymptotically . by increasing the phase shift @xmath172 per timestep",
    ", the cooling efficiency can be enhanced .",
    "each data point corresponds to an average over 1,000 realizations.,title=\"fig : \" ]    as demonstrated before , this discussion can be generalized to the entire lattice system , with the jump operators for the site terms @xmath64 being given by @xmath194 .",
    "the cooling process can then be understood in the anyon picture as follows : each spin flip incoherently moves an anyon to an adjacent plaquette or site , see fig .",
    "[ fig : charges ] , and whenever two anyons of the same type meet , they are annihilated and their energy is removed from the system . for larger values of @xmath172 the dynamics",
    "is given by a discrete version of the quantum master equation with the cooling being even more efficient .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : numtc ] , the most efficient preparation of the ground state occurs for @xmath106 . for this value of @xmath172 , a dissipative move of an anyon to",
    "an adjacent plaquette takes place with unit probability .",
    "the above analysis for ground state cooling of the toric code can be extended to a large class of interesting models . in general",
    ", one can design jump operators , where any ground state of a frustration free hamiltonian is the unique dark state . with a suitable choice",
    ", one would expect the cooling of any initial state into the ground state of the frustration free hamiltonian in analogy to the toric code discussed above .",
    "an example for a spin liquid phase at the roskhar - kievelson point has been discussed in @xcite . an important question for the experimental realization is the efficiency of such ground state cooling : within quantum information theory , the efficient cooling requires that the time evolution of an arbitrary initial state approaches the ground state exponentially with a characteristic cooling rate , which scales polynomially in the system size .",
    "so far it has been demonstrated that an important subclass of frustration free hamiltonians , namely stabilizer states , can be cooled efficiently @xcite .",
    "however , it remains an open question whether the ground state of a general frustration free hamiltonian can be prepared efficiently with dissipative techniques .",
    "the toric code discussed above represents an example of a stabilizer state , which exhibits abelian topological order .",
    "however , a stabilizer formulation can also be derived for large classes of states exhibiting non - abelian topological order : an important example are the string net condensates @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the dissipative ground state cooling illustrated for the toric code above allows one also to efficiently prepare ground states with highly non - abelian topological order .",
    "these can serve as the building block for a topological quantum computer .",
    "in this work we aimed at discussing the implementation of a digital quantum simulation architecture using rydberg atoms in optical lattices .",
    "our goal was furthermore to outline schemes for the simulation of coherent and dissipative dynamics corresponding to ( many - body ) spin models .",
    "recently , these concepts for the digital simulation of open - system dynamics have been extended to systems of trapped ions @xcite . in a remarkable experiment @xcite",
    ", a combination of single- and multi - qubit ( entangling ) gates and optical pumping has been used to simulate coherent four - body spin interactions and dissipative four - qubit stabilizer pumping , thereby demonstrating in a minimal system of one plaquette the elementary building blocks required for future large - scale simulations of kitaev s toric code and related models .",
    "while the underlying physical interactions of this trapped ions simulator naturally differ from the van - der - waals interaction between rydberg atoms , the current experiments demonstrate the experimental feasibility of the digital approach to quantum simulation of open - system dynamics in interacting many - body systems .",
    "furthermore , they clearly illustrate the generic effect of how errors in the employed gates , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : kitaev ] , affect the actual simulated dynamics , and suggest that , ultimately , in future large - scale fault - tolerant quantum simulation quantum error correction techniques might have to be incorporated .    for the rydberg simulator architecture described in the present work , in principle",
    "all individual building blocks have been experimentally demonstrated individually : the first entangling rydberg gates have been recently realized in the laboratory for two atoms held in optical tweezers @xcite .",
    "important next steps will be to improve these rydberg entangling operations and to incorporate them in larger optical trap arrays and / or optical lattices , where mott insulator states involving many lattice sites can be prepared with high accuracy and single - site addressability has become available . in combination with the development of efficient multi - atom entangling rydberg gates as the one reviewed here @xcite this appears to be a promising route towards large - scale quantum simulations of many - body spin models , which lie beyond the cope of classical simulation capabilities .",
