    "recently there has been much interest in hard exclusive reactions .",
    "this followed from the proof of factorization by collins _",
    "@xcite for exclusive lepto - production .",
    "the proof guarantees that under certain conditions , the exclusive amplitude can be factorized into a hard term calculable from qcd and a soft term that ideally should be universal .",
    "this latter contribution has typically been parameterized by generalized parton distributions or gpds  @xcite .",
    "this is analogous to the case of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , where inclusive cross sections can be parameterized in terms of universal parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) that are related to quark probabilities in the nucleon .",
    "the only difference is that in hard exclusive processes the amplitude typically requires an integral over the gpds .    from duality we know that it is in principle possible to use any channel to describe the scattering amplitude .",
    "in dis it is known that the @xmath1-channel representation is generally the most efficient way to characterize these reactions .",
    "the only exception to this occurs at very small bjorken @xmath2 . except in this small-@xmath3 regime",
    ", dis amplitudes can be related to the intrinsic quark structure of the nucleon . at",
    "very small @xmath3 , amplitudes associated with @xmath0-channel processes will become important ; as @xmath2 the structure function evolves to represent ladders of partons originating from @xmath0-channel meson exchanges , and regge exchange makes an important contribution in this regime .",
    "once it was realized that regge exchange may play a significant role in exclusive electroproduction , attempts have been made to incorporate regge effects using analogies with dis , _",
    "i.e _ to restrict regge contributions in exclusive electroproduction reactions to low-@xmath4 so that scaling is not otherwise modified @xcite",
    ". it had not been proven that regge contributions should only contribute to exclusive amplitudes in this domain .",
    "we will investigate the question of whether regge effects should be substantial in hard exclusive processes and if so , in what kinematic regime they will be important .",
    "rather surprisingly , we find that , at high energies when @xmath5 is large and @xmath0 small , regge effects will be significant .",
    "this implies that in this region , hard exclusive processes will be more sensitive to the structure of exchanged mesons than they are to the intrinsic quark structure of the nucleon .",
    "we first investigated this question by examining hard exclusive processes in a @xmath0-channel formalism , as was reported in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "consider a general hard exclusive amplitude a^*(q ) + n(p ) b(q ) + n(p )  .",

    "[ eq : tjred ]     @xmath0-channel meson contribution to the hadronic tensor for exclusive lepto - production .",
    "the amplitude is summed over all spins @xmath18 that can contribute , and depends on the product of the residue functions @xmath30 at the upper and lower vertices.,width=288 ]    the key question is how the upper residue function depends on the large variables ( @xmath5 and @xmath31 in the case of inclusive processes , and @xmath5 for the exclusive amplitudes ) .",
    "it is well known that for kinematics relevant to inclusive scattering , the upper residue function behaves as @xmath32 , _ modulo _ logarithmic corrections , so that the amplitude scales , @xmath33 , as expected  @xcite . summing over all spins leads to the regge behavior , @xmath34 . in the small @xmath2 limit in dis ,",
    "the leading regge trajectory with @xmath35 will dominate the behavior of the hadronic tensor , while all daughter trajectories with @xmath36 are subleading at very small @xmath3 . for finite @xmath37 ,",
    "however , daughter regge trajectories are no longer suppressed , and as a result the regge description becomes ineffective while the @xmath1-channel parton model description becomes natural .",
    "the situation is quite different for exclusive electroproduction .",
    "this can be shown by writing the contribution of a @xmath0-channel spin @xmath18 exchange in terms of the two - current correlation in the exchanged meson .",
    "this can be expanded in terms of a covariant bethe - salpeter amplitude for the exchanged meson , represented in terms of the spectral density @xmath38 .",
    "the spectral density is related to the parton distribution amplitude in a meson and can in principle be constrained from electromagnetic data  @xcite and qcd asymptotics  @xcite . in the bjorken limit , using the feynman parametrization for the quark propagators and ignoring small terms we showed that the upper vertex function could be written @xcite ^u_jn & = & _ -1 ^ 1 dx d^2 g_jn(x,^2 ) _ 0 ^ 1 d  .",
    "+ [ eq : beta ] for inclusive amplitudes when @xmath39 , the @xmath3 disappears from the denominator and the integration over @xmath40 is dominated by @xmath41 . as a result ,",
    "the entire integral is of order @xmath42 , as we argued earlier .    for exclusive amplitudes however where @xmath43 , the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta ] ) is dominated by the region @xmath44 , and finite @xmath40 .",
    "the endpoint behavior of the distribution amplitudes @xmath45 is spin independent , and for leading - twist amplitudes @xmath46 .",
    "this leads to a @xmath18-independent suppression of the upper vertex with @xmath5 , @xmath47 _ independent of the spin of the exchanged meson_. upon summing over all spins from a single trajectory one finds that for small @xmath0 the hadronic tensor is proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "thus , in the bjorken limit exclusive lepto - production should be dominated by a single leading regge trajectory for all @xmath37 , and not just for @xmath2 . in this regime",
    "hard exclusive processes probe the nucleon s meson cloud rather than its intrinsic quark properties .",
    "since this result was rather surprising , we repeated the derivation of hard exclusive amplitudes in an @xmath1-channel framework @xcite , where we analyzed the `` handbag '' diagrams used in extracting gpds .",
    "we obtained the same results , namely that in the region of high energy and small @xmath0 , regge effects will make sizeable contributions to hard exclusive amplitudes .",
    "we showed that the dvcs formalism is ill - defined in the presence of regge behavior in the parton - nucleon amplitude . this has the following consequences for hard exclusive processes .    1 .",
    "the breakdown of collinear factorization in these processes means that the soft amplitudes are not universal , but are process - dependent amplitudes that we call regge exclusive amplitudes .",
    "2 .   the validity of qcd factorization for exclusive lepto - production will require , in addition to a hard scale @xmath5 , a sizeable value of @xmath0 .",
    "3 .   in the region of small @xmath0",
    "regge effects will make substantial contributions to dvcs and exclusive meson lepto - production .",
    "4 .   exclusive lepto - production processes will show violation of qcd scaling arguments .",
    "these scaling violations will persist regardless of the magnitude of @xmath5 , in contradiction to expectations of qcd scaling .",
    "5 .   in the region of small",
    "@xmath0 hard exclusive amplitudes will exhibit a @xmath5 behavior @xmath48 characteristic of hadronic regge amplitudes .",
    "these amplitudes should be well approximated by the contribution from the leading regge trajectory .",
    "recently a hall a collaboration at jefferson laboratory has carried out a test of scaling in dvcs reactions @xcite .",
    "the data appear to be in very good agreement with the @xmath5-independent dvcs amplitude predicted by qcd @xcite , however the available @xmath5 window is quite small , from @xmath49 and within the published experimental errors one can not rule out a power - like dependence of the amplitude , @xmath50 , with @xmath40 as large as 0.25 .",
    "even more surprising , `` standard '' regge - exchange models have proved successful in describing a variety of differential cross sections @xcite , in the kinematic range where scaling would be expected based on comparisons with dis .",
    "our calculations show that the success of the regge picture is to be expected , and is not accidental .",
    "a recent experimental analysis of @xmath51 electroproduction at jefferson laboratory  @xcite showed that their data was in good agreement with predictions from standard regge phenomenology , while showing large uncertainties with analyses based on models of gpds  @xcite .",
    "though our results were derived in the bjorken limit with @xmath52 , the jlab data corresponds to energies of a few gev and values up to @xmath53 . in fig .",
    "[ datos2 ] we compare our predictions with exclusive meson electroproduction data .",
    "qcd scaling arguments predict that the reduced @xmath54 cross section should fall off at fixed @xmath4 as @xmath55 .",
    "we predict a behavior @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "fitting @xmath54 data from hermes  @xcite in the range @xmath58 gives @xmath59 .",
    "similarly for @xmath51 electroproduction cross section from the clas collaboration  @xcite we find @xmath60 for the range @xmath61 .",
    "we see that for both dvcs and exclusive meson electroproduction , not only are scaling violations observed , but the additional @xmath5 dependence is softer than predicted by scaling , and is in agreement with our predicted factor of @xmath62 where @xmath63 . at this point",
    "it is difficult to compare the regge exponents @xmath40 obtained from the fit with total cross - section data , since the electroproduction data corresponds to different values of @xmath0 .",
    "this issue warrants further phenomenological study .     a simple fit to some meson electroproduction data ; @xmath54 results from hermes ( squares ,  @xcite ) , and @xmath51 ( circles ,  @xcite ) results from the clas collaboration at jefferson lab . in the case of @xmath54 production",
    "the cross section reduced by the photon flux is plotted in arbitrary units.,width=240 ]    in conclusion , we have shown that the regge nature of parton - nucleon amplitudes generates divergences in gpds at low @xmath0 . in this region",
    "we predict sizeable effects due to scattering from the meson cloud in the nucleon , while at sufficiently large @xmath0 the dominant effect will come from scattering of quarks in the nucleon .",
    "an important remaining question is how one can disentangle scattering off the meson cloud from effects of nucleon tomography .",
