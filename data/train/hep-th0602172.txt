    "the idea that we live in more than the observed @xmath0 dimensions has been of huge interest ever since it was first suggested by kaluza and klein in the 1920s @xcite .",
    "they studied a five - dimensional gravitational theory in a model with an extra _ compact _ dimension .",
    "the effective four dimensional theory then contains @xmath0 dimensional gravity as well as the electromagnetic fields and a scalar field . in a similar way",
    ", some ( super)string theories contain solutions in which extra dimensions ( required for the consistency of those string theories ) are all compact @xcite ( superstring theories have @xmath1 extra compact dimensions ) .",
    "the size of these compact dimensions is of the order of the planck length @xmath2 .",
    "an example is the calabi - yau space in heterotic string theory whose properties determine the low energy effective field theory .",
    "other models , which were discussed extensively in recent years are so - called brane world scenarios @xcite which assume that the standard model ( sm ) fields are confined to a @xmath3-brane ( a @xmath4 dimensional submanifold ) which is embedded in a higher dimensional space - time .",
    "some of the extra dimensions need now be _ non - compact_.    since gravity is a property of space - time itself , a model which describes appropriately the well - tested newton s law should localise gravity well enough to the @xmath3-brane .",
    "this was achieved in @xcite by placing a @xmath3-brane into @xmath5 dimensions with the @xmath5th dimension being infinite . for the localisation of gravity in this model ,",
    "the brane tension has to be fine - tuned to the negative bulk cosmological constant .",
    "recently , the localisation of gravity on different topological defects has been discussed @xcite .",
    "this includes domain walls @xcite , nielsen - olesen strings @xcite , and magnetic monopoles @xcite in @xmath5 , @xmath1 and @xmath6 space - time dimensions , respectively .",
    "it was found @xcite that gravity - localising ( so - called `` warped '' ) solutions are possible if certain relations between the defect s tensions hold .",
    "while in the case of domain walls and strings , gravity can only be localised when the bulk cosmological constant is negative , for magnetic monopoles the gravity - localisation is possible for both signs of the cosmological constant .",
    "brane world models including higher dimensional topological defects have recently also been discussed without bulk cosmological constant and from another point of view .",
    "7-dimensional brane worlds with a monopole ( global and local ) residing in the three extra dimensions have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the emphasis was put on the analysis of the localisation of the singularities in the 7-dimensional space - times .",
    "inflating branes were studied , i.e. branes with a positive 4-dimensional cosmological constant and it was shown that the singularity can be removed from the space - time .    in this paper we study the model of @xcite for inflating branes . for completeness we also study the case of a positive bulk cosmological constant and",
    "determine the pattern of solutions .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : in section ii , we present the 6 dimensional einstein - abelian - higgs ( eah ) model , we give the equations of motion and present special analytic solutions for trivial matter fields . in section iii",
    ", we present our numerical results .",
    "we give our conclusions in section iv .",
    "we have the following @xmath1-dimensional action @xcite : @xmath7 where the standard gravity action reads @xmath8 @xmath9 is the bulk cosmological constant , @xmath10 is the fundamental gravity scale with @xmath11 and @xmath12 the determinant of the @xmath1-dimensional metric .    the action @xmath13 for the einstein  abelian - higgs ( eah ) string is given in analogy to the 4-dimensional case @xcite by :    @xmath14    with the covariant derivative @xmath15 and the field strength @xmath16 of the u(1 ) gauge potential @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the vacuum expectation value of the complex valued higgs field @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the self - coupling constant of the higgs field .",
    "the ansatz for the @xmath1-dimensional metric reads : @xmath21 -d\\rho^2- l^2(\\rho)d\\theta^2   \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 $ ] are the coordinates associated with the extra dimensions , while @xmath24 , @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 $ ] are the 4-dimensional coordinates .",
    "@xmath27 is the 4-dimensional cosmological constant .",
    "the 4-dimensional metric satisfies the 4-dimensional einstein equations : @xmath28 the space - time has four killing vectors : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . here",
    "we have replaced the 4-dimensional flat minkowski brane by an inflating brane whose 4-dimensional metric is given by the de sitter metric .",
    "note that we are using static coordinates here .",
    "the 4-dimensional curvature scalar associated with this inflating brane is then @xmath33 .",
    "the motivation to use an inflating brane comes from the observationally confirmed assumption that out universe has a small positive cosmological constant .    for the gauge and higgs field , we have @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the vorticity of the string , which throughout this paper we choose @xmath36 .      introducing the following dimensionless coordinate @xmath37 and the dimensionless function @xmath38 : @xmath39 the set of equations depends only on the following dimensionless coupling constants : @xmath40 the gravitational equations then read : @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    the euler - lagrange equations for the matter fields read : @xmath44 and @xmath45 the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath37 .",
    "the equations ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] ) can be combined to obtain the following two differential equations for the two unknown metric functions : @xmath46 and @xmath47      in the following we will discuss the 4-dimensional effective action arising in the limit @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the case where the matter fields are equal to their vacuum values is of interest to understand the asymptotic behaviour of the system in the generic case .",
    "many publications have dealt with this , e.g. @xcite , since in contrast to the generic case analytic results are available .",
    "note that from ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) it follows that @xmath50 unless @xmath51 is constant .    due to the ansatz we use for the metric , a dimensional reduction of the gravity action ( [ action_gravity ] ) can be performed . for this purpose notice that we can write the 6-dimensional ricci scalar @xmath52 according to : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the 4-dimensional ricci scalar associated with the metric on the brane .",
    "using the fact that @xmath55 , @xmath56 constant , we obtain the following 4-dimensional effective action :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 and at first order , taking into account the fact that the matter fields are localized and will not influence the asymptotic form , we can define an effective coupling constant according to @xmath59 where @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "@xmath61 is then the radius of the 2-dimensional transverse space .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath62 can be approximated by its value in absence of matter fields which can be evaluated exactly to be @xmath63 .",
    "explicit solutions can be constructed for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "these are by themselves of interest , of course , but are also interesting for the generic solutions since we would expect that the metric fields take the form presented below far away from the core of the string .",
    "a similar analysis has been done for global defects in @xcite .      for @xmath65",
    "the system admits two different types of solutions @xcite : @xmath66 and @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 are arbitrary constants . by analogy to the 4-dimensional case , we refer to these solutions as to the `` string '' ( s ) and `` melvin '' ( m ) branches , respectively .",
    "note that the only difference to the 4-dimensional case are the powers in ( [ sol2 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath71 the explicit solutions read :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 are arbitrary parameters and @xmath76 .",
    "these solutions are periodic in the metric functions . in the 4-dimensional analogue ,",
    "i.e. nielsen - olesen strings in de sitter space , periodic solutions also appear for trivial matter fields @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that the string and melvin solutions ( [ sol1 ] ) , ( [ sol2 ] ) can be obtained from these solutions for special choices of the free parameters and specific limits ( for @xmath77 ) of the trigonometric solution .",
    "the solutions for @xmath78 are given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 are arbitrary constants .",
    "in the case @xmath83 the solution for @xmath84 , @xmath38 can be written in terms of quadratures as follows : @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 are integration constants and @xmath88 is arbitrary .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath84 is involved .",
    "it depends on elliptic functions if @xmath89 , in the case @xmath64 , the integration can be done by an elementary change of variable and leads to the expressions above . in the particular case @xmath65 and with @xmath90",
    "we find @xmath91 this latter solution corresponds to a cigar - type solution ( in the extra dimensions ) and we find that for @xmath92 the solutions are also of this type , however can not be given in an explicit form .",
    "`` cigar - type '' refers to the fact that @xmath93 .",
    "consequently , the circumference of a circle in the two extra dimensions becomes independent of the bulk radius @xmath22 .",
    "an analogue solution in @xmath6 dimensions with monopoles residing in the three extra dimensions has been found previously in @xcite . in the case",
    "@xmath71 , @xmath94 and @xmath90 we find @xmath95 again , the metric functions are periodic .",
    "the periodicity of string - like solutions in de sitter space seems to be a generic feature - independent of the number of space - time dimensions or of the type of brane present .",
    "we require regularity at the origin @xmath96 which leads to the boundary conditions : @xmath97 along with @xcite , we assume the matter fields to approach their usual asymptotic value far from the string core ( i.e. for @xmath98 )  : @xmath99      close to the origin @xmath96 , the functions have the following behaviour : @xmath100 for @xmath64 the behaviour found in @xcite is recovered .    for @xmath101",
    ", the matter functions tend to their asymptotic values @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "the metric functions thus tend asymptotically to the special solutions described above .",
    "following the investigations in @xcite , we here mainly aim at a classification of the generic solutions available in the system .",
    "we solve the system of ordinary differential equations subject to the above boundary conditions numerically .",
    "the system depends on three independent coupling constants @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "we here fix @xmath107 , corresponding to the self dual case in flat space , and we will in the following describe the pattern of solutions in the @xmath105-@xmath106 plane . results for the 4-dimensional gravitating string @xcite make us believe that the pattern of solutions for @xmath108 is qualitatively similar . for vorticity @xmath109 , the situation might change ( see @xcite ) , however , we do nt discuss this case here .",
    "as will become evident , the presence of two cosmological constants leads to a rather complicated pattern of solutions .",
    "the different types of solutions available are summarized is the summary section .",
    "their interconnection is illustrated in fig.[fig11 ] .",
    "the case @xmath65 was studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "we review the main results here to fit it into the overall pattern of solutions .",
    "the pattern of solution in the @xmath105-@xmath106-plane is given in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "for @xmath65 and @xmath110 two branches of solutions exist , with an asymptotic behaviour of the metric functions given by ( [ sol1 ] ) and ( [ sol2 ] ) . referring to their counterparts in a four - dimensional space - time @xcite we denote these two families of solutions as the `` string '' and `` melvin '' branches , respectively .",
    "the terminology used e.g. in @xcite will be used throughout the rest of the paper .    specifically for @xmath107 , we have @xmath111 and @xmath112 , @xmath113 . at @xmath114",
    "the two solutions coincide and @xmath115 . when the parameter @xmath105 is increased to values larger than @xmath116 the string and melvin solutions get progressively deformed into closed solutions with zeros of the metric functions . for @xmath117 indeed , the the string branch smoothly evolves into the so called inverted string branch ( again using the terminology of @xcite ) .",
    "the inverted string solutions are characterized by the fact that the slope of the function @xmath118 is constant and negative , @xmath118 therefore crosses zero at some finite value of @xmath37 , say @xmath119 . on the other hand",
    ", the melvin branch evolves into the kasner branch , a configuration for which the function @xmath51 develops a zero at some finite value of @xmath120 while @xmath118 becomes infinite for @xmath121 .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath122 these solutions have the behaviour @xmath123 , @xmath124 . the transition between melvin solutions ( for @xmath110 ) and",
    "kasner solutions ( for @xmath117 ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    for negative @xmath106 and @xmath110 ,",
    "the string and melvin solutions are still present and merge into a single solution at some critical value of @xmath106 . for @xmath125 and @xmath117",
    ", we have the zero @xmath126 of the inverted string solution increasing with decreasing @xmath106 .",
    "it reaches infinity for the exponentially decreasing solution , the so - called `` warped '' solution that localises gravity on the brane @xcite .",
    "if the cosmological constant is further decreased the solution becomes of kasner - type .      up to now",
    "static branes have only been discussed in an asymptotically flat or anti - de sitter bulk . here",
    ", we also consider the case of static branes in a de sitter bulk .",
    "first , we examine the evolution of the string and melvin solutions for @xmath71 . for all solution constructed with @xmath71",
    ", we were able to recover the behaviour ( [ vacuumtri ] ) asymptotically .",
    "this evolution is illustrated in fig.[fig3 ] and fig.[fig4 ] for @xmath128 respectively for the string and melvin solutions .",
    "here , we show the metric functions @xmath84 , @xmath38 for @xmath89 and @xmath129 . for @xmath71",
    "we find a solution with the metric function @xmath51 possessing a zero at some finite @xmath37 , say @xmath130 . at the same time",
    "these solutions tend to the string solutions in the limit @xmath77 . following the convention used in the @xmath65-case",
    ", we refer to these solutions as of `` kasner''-type .",
    "the second type of solutions that we find has metric functions behaving for @xmath132 as @xmath133 these tend to the melvin solutions in the limit @xmath134 and we will refer to them as of `` inverted string''-type .    for fixed @xmath71 and increasing @xmath105",
    "we find that both kasner and inverted string solutions exist for all values of @xmath105 .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig.[fig5 ] where the values of the parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 ( defined in eq.([vacuumtri ] ) ) are plotted as functions of @xmath105 .      here",
    ", we discuss inflating branes ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "again , we fix @xmath135 .",
    "since observational evidence points to a positive cosmological constant in our universe ( which is represented by the inflating 3-brane ) we restrict to @xmath94 here .",
    "the pattern of solutions can largely be characterized by the integration constant @xmath87 appearing in ( [ quadrature ] ) .",
    "first , we have constructed solutions corresponding to deformations of the string solutions residing in the extra dimensions .",
    "we present the profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] for @xmath136 and for comparison for @xmath64 .",
    "obviously , the presence of an inflating brane ( @xmath137 ) changes the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath84 , @xmath38 drastically in comparison to a minkowski brane .",
    "@xmath51 now behaves lineary far from the core of the string , while @xmath118 tends to a constant .",
    "the solutions approach asymptotically ( [ quadrature ] ) .",
    "the space - time is thus cigar - like .",
    "this can be explained as follows  : in the case @xmath138 the equations are self dual , in particular the equation determining the function @xmath84 on the string branch is @xmath139 ( the combination of the energy momentum tensor vanishes identically for @xmath107 and for the string like solution ) .",
    "the value of @xmath87 compatible with the boundary condition turns out to be @xmath140 , since we are interested is small values of @xmath141 , the integral ( [ quadrature ] ) can be reasonably approximated by ( [ kappasol ] ) , in complete agreement with our numerical results .",
    "the parameters @xmath142 and @xmath87 appearing in ( [ quadrature ] ) can be determined numerically .",
    "it turns out that for the cigar - like solutions we always have @xmath143 , while @xmath142 is positive . for a fixed value of @xmath141 and varying @xmath105",
    ", we find that @xmath144 for a critical , @xmath141-dependent value of @xmath105 , @xmath145 . at the same time @xmath146 for @xmath147 .",
    "this is shown for three different values of @xmath141 in fig.[fig7 ] and fig.[fig8 ] . in the limit @xmath147",
    ", the diameter of the cigar tends to zero and the cigar - like solutions cease to exist .",
    "we have also studied solutions corresponding to deformations of the melvin solutions .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath148 melvin solution is smoothly deformed for @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath87 is always positive and tends exponentially to zero as function of @xmath105 . for @xmath117",
    "we find that the solutions have a zero of the metric function @xmath38 at some @xmath105- and @xmath141-dependent value of @xmath37 .",
    "the solutions are thus of inverted string - type .",
    "we present the pattern of solutions in the @xmath105-@xmath141-plane in fig.[fig9 ] .",
    "we have limited our analysis here to @xmath149 . for @xmath150 ,",
    "the numerical analysis becomes very unreliable , that is why we do nt report our results here .",
    "fixing @xmath105 , e.g. to @xmath151 , the inverted string solutions ( available for @xmath71 , @xmath64 ) gets smoothly deformed for @xmath94 .",
    "the constant @xmath87 is positive for all solutions . for fixed @xmath141 and @xmath77 the melvin solution",
    "is approached .    the kasner solutions ( for @xmath152 )",
    "get deformed and the functions @xmath84 , @xmath38 become periodic in @xmath37 asymptotically .",
    "these are deformations of the periodic solution ( [ trigonometric ] ) with @xmath92 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig10 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath87 for these solutions is negative .",
    "the function @xmath84 oscillates around a mean value given by @xmath153 and stays strictly positive , the solution is therefore regular .",
    "the period of the solution depends weakly on @xmath141 . in the limit ,",
    "@xmath77 the periodic solutions tend to the cigar - like solutions .",
    "as mentioned above , we notice that the values of the constants @xmath141 and @xmath106 can be chosen in such a way that @xmath154 becomes arbitrarily small .",
    "this seems compatible with the domain of parameters leading to periodic solutions .",
    "the corresponding planck mass determined through ( [ plmas ] ) can therefore be made arbitrarily large .",
    "a sketch of the pattern of the solutions is proposed in fig.[fig11 ] .",
    "the fact that we obtain periodic solutions constitutes a natural framework to define finite volume brane world models . with view to the discussion on the effective 4-dimensional action",
    ", we could imagine to put branes with `` large '' effective gravitational coupling at @xmath155 , @xmath156 , where @xmath157 corresponds to the position of the maxima of @xmath51 .",
    "correspondingly , branes with `` small '' effective gravitational coupling could be put at @xmath158 , @xmath159 , where @xmath160 are the positions of the minima of @xmath51 . though there is no `` warping '' in the sense of randall and sundrum @xcite",
    ", nevertheless gravity looks stronger on the branes positioned at the maxima of @xmath51 in contrast to gravity on the branes positioned at the minima .",
    "note that at the positions of these branes , the metric function @xmath118 vanishes , i.e. @xmath161 . thus the cylindrical geometry of the extra dimensional space shrinks to a point and the whole space - time geometry becomes effectively 5-dimensional .",
    "we have studied static as well as inflating brane solutions in a 6-dimensional brane world scenario with an abelian string residing in the two extra dimensions .",
    "the pattern of the solutions is very rich , leading to many different types of behaviours of the gravitating fields ( depending on the values of @xmath105 , @xmath141 and @xmath106 ) outside the core of te string .",
    "we find it convenient to summarize the possiblilites as follows    * string solutions ( s ) with @xmath162 , @xmath163 for @xmath164 , * melvin solutions ( m ) with @xmath165 , @xmath166 for @xmath164 , * inverted string solutions ( is ) with @xmath167 , @xmath168 at some finite value of @xmath37 ( @xmath169 for some intermediate value of @xmath130 ) , * kasner solutions ( k ) with @xmath170 , @xmath163 at some finite value of @xmath37 , * cigar - type solutions ( c ) with @xmath171 , @xmath172 for @xmath173 , * periodic solutions ( per ) with @xmath84 , @xmath38 periodic in the bulk coordinate @xmath37 .      evaluating the different curvature invariants of the metric we find that the kasner and inverted string solutions possess a physical singularity at the value of @xmath37 at which the function @xmath84 vanishes .",
    "note that this excludes the inverted string solutions for static branes in an asymptotically flat bulk , where @xmath84 possesses no zero .",
    "these solutions were shown to be regular @xcite .",
    "all the other space - times are without physical singularities .",
    "if the symmetry breaking scale is below a critical below ( given by the higher - dimensional planck scale ) corresponding to @xmath110 , the space - time containing a static brane is singularity - free for an asymptotically flat or anti - de - sitter bulk , however has singularities for an asymptotically de sitter bulk ( positive bulk cosmological constant ) .",
    "inflating branes lead to a cigar - like universe for vanishing bulk cosmological constant at a symmetry breaking scale below a specific value that depends on the value of the brane cosmological constant .",
    "next to these , also melvin solutions exist , which again are singularity - free .",
    "if the symmetry breaking scale is above a critical value , the space - time is singular for static branes in an asymptotically flat bulk ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "if we replace the static brane by an inflating brane , the space - time still possesses a singularity .",
    "equally , the introduction of a positive cosmological constant does nt remove the singularity of the space - time .",
    "if both the bulk cosmological constant and the brane cosmological constant are non - vanishing , regular space - times are possible , namely periodic solutions with non - vanishing minima of the metric functions .",
    "these appear if in the space - time with @xmath71 ( kasner solutions ) the static brane is replaced by an inflating brane .",
    "if one puts branes at the respective minima and maxima of these periodic solutions , a hierarchy between the effective 4-dimensional gravitational coupling is possible .    as a final remark",
    "let us relate our periodic solutions to recently investigated solutions in higher dimensional space - times , namely `` non - uniform black strings '' ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , referring to fig.1 of @xcite , the solution in the extra dimension could be continued periodically by gluing several copies of the solution .",
    "the structure in the extra dimension then becomes kind of periodic .",
    "the crucial difference , of course , is that in the present paper we do nt have black holes extended into extra dimensions , but an inflating brane ( the 3-brane ) with two extra dimensions .",
    "however , again , we find a periodicity of the solution in the extra dimension , in our case in the @xmath37-direction .",
    "the periodic solutions presented here could thus be seen as `` non - uniform de sitter - vacuua '' .",
