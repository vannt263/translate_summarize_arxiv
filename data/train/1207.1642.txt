    "recently , the observations of high redshift type ia supernovae and the surveys of clusters of galaxies @xcite@xcite reveal the universe accelerating expansion and that the density of matter is very much less than the critical density .",
    "also the observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies indicate that the universe is flat and the total energy density is very close to the critical one @xcite .",
    "the above observational data properly complete each other and point out that the dark energy ( de ) is the dominant component of the present universe which occupies about @xmath1 of the energy of our universe , while dark matter ( dm ) occupies @xmath2 , and the usual baryonic matter about @xmath3 .",
    "there are prominent candidates for de such as the cosmological constant @xcite , a dynamically evolving scalar field ( like quintessence ) @xcite or phantom ( field with negative energy ) @xcite that explain the cosmic accelerating expansion .",
    "meanwhile , the accelerating expansion of universe can also be described through modified gravity @xcite , brane cosmology and so on @xcite@xcite .    to explain the early and late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "it is most often the case that such fields interact with matter ; directly due to a matter lagrangian coupling , indirectly through a coupling to the ricci scalar or as the result of quantum loop corrections @xcite@xcite .",
    "if the scalar field self - interactions are negligible , then the experimental bounds on such a field are very strong ; requiring it to either couple to matter much more weakly than gravity does , or to be very heavy @xcite@xcite . in some models , coupling of the scalar field to matter should be tuned to extremely too small values in order not to be conflict with the equivalence principal @xcite . in the proposed models , the scalar field couples to matter with gravitational strength , in harmony with general expectations from string theory @xcite@xcite .",
    "then , the scalar field is permitted to couple to matter much more strongly than gravity does , and yet still satisfies the current experimental and observational constraints .",
    "the cosmological value of such a field evolves over hubble time - scales and could potentially cause the late - time acceleration of our universe @xcite .",
    "the crucial feature that these models possess are that the mass of the scalar field depends on the local background matter density . while the idea of a density - dependent mass term is not new @xcite@xcite , the work presented in @xcite is novel in that the scalar field can couple directly to matter with gravitational strength .",
    "since the scalar field mimics the background ( radiation / matter ) matter field , subdominant for most of the evolution history except at late times when it becomes dominant , it may be regarded as a cosmological tracker field @xcite .    in this paper , we study the detailed evolution of a cosmological model that an scalar field nonminimally coupled to the matter lagrangian .",
    "we assume frw cosmological model with open , closed and open background geometries . in sec .",
    "2 , we present the model in terms of dimensionless dynamical variables . in sec . 3 , by best - fitting the model with the most recent observational data , the type ia supernovea ( sne ia)for distance modulus and applying @xmath4 method ,",

    "we summarize our results in section 6 .",
    "in this section we consider an action of gravity in the presence of a scalar field nonminimally coupled to the matter lagrangian , @xmath5\\sqrt{-g}dx^{4},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is ricci scalar , @xmath7 is the newtonian constant gravity and @xmath8 is the scalar field with a potential @xmath9 . unlike the usual einstein - hilbert action",
    ", the matter lagrangian @xmath10 is modified as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is an analytic function of the scalar field .",
    "this last term in lagrangian brings about the nonminimal interaction between the matter and scalar field .",
    "the variation of action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the metric tensor components in frw cosmology yields the field equations , @xmath13 @xmath14 where we put @xmath15 and assume a perfect fluid with @xmath16 . in the above equations , for flat , closed and open models of the universe , @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "we also assumed that he energy density @xmath17 stands for the contribution from the cold dark matter to the energy density , @xmath18 .",
    "also variation of the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the scalar field @xmath19 provides the wave equation for the scalar field as @xmath20 where prime indicated differentiation with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "one can easily find that both components -the scalar field @xmath19 and the coupling @xmath12 with cdm , @xmath21- do not conserve separately but that they interact through a term @xmath22 according to @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the energy exchange term derived from the model .",
    "we also define the ratio between the energy densities as @xmath26 .    in the following we present the structure of the dynamical system by introducing the dimensionless variables : @xmath27 where `` @xmath28 '' means coupling of the scalar function @xmath29 with matter field .",
    "we consider that both scalar function and scalar potential behave exponentially as @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are dimensionless constants characterizing the slope of potential @xmath9 and @xmath12 .",
