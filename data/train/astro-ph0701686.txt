    "ht ]     .,width=302 ]    measurements of magnetic intensity in the interstellar atomic hydrogen reveal that the magnetic intensity is about 6@xmath0 g ( troland & heiles 1986 , heiles 1987 , heiles & troland 2005 ) .",
    "this indicates that the magnetic energy overcomes the thermal energy by a factor of a few .",
    "since the density in hi varies over at least 2 orders of magnitude , the question arises of how the gas can condense so strongly in spite of a strong magnetic field without the help of gravity which is negligible in hi .",
    "moreover , the magnetic intensity is observed to be nearly independent of the gas density .",
    "more generally knowing the effect of the magnetic field on the development of the thermal instability is of great relevance for hi . here",
    "we present some results obtained either analytically or by the mean of 1d numerical simulations to answer these questions . in the second section ,",
    "we consider the case of an initially uniform magnetic field and identify precisely a mechanism which permits naturally the condensation to proceed along the field lines . in section 3",
    ", we investigate the effects of circularly polarized alfvn waves on thermal instability .",
    "section 4 concludes the paper .",
    "dynamical motions such as shocks ( koyama & inutsuka 2000 ) or converging flows ( hennebelle & prault 1999 ) have been proposed to be an efficient way of triggering thermal instability . here",
    "we study how an initially uniform magnetic field making an angle @xmath1 with the initial velocity field affects the condensation process .",
    "figure 1 shows the results of a 1d numerical simulation .",
    "the configuration being symmetrical with respect to y - axis , only half of the solution is displayed .",
    "the arrows display the velocity field whereas the thick solid line is the magnetic field line at the current time step .",
    "the thin solid line is the initial magnetic field line .",
    "three timesteps are displayed .",
    "first panel shows that the converging flow has bended the field lines therefore increasing the magnetic pressure .",
    "this has the effect to slow down the gas and tends to stop the condensation .",
    "however in the same way , magnetic tension has generated a transverse flow .",
    "second panel reveals that the transverse flow has significantly unbended the magnetic field lines and therefore decreases the magnetic pressure . as a consequence",
    "the condensation can proceed along the field line as shown in third panel .",
    "figure 2 shows the condensation threshold for various values of the angle @xmath1 and the magnetic intensity for 2 different values of the initial velocity field .",
    "when the magnetic intensity is small , @xmath1 decreases rapidly when @xmath2 increases .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the magnetic pressure being stronger .",
    "however for intermediate values of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 g ) , @xmath1 does not decreases anymore when @xmath2 increases and for strong values of @xmath2 , @xmath1 increases with @xmath2 .",
    "this behaviour is a direct consequence of the magnetic tension which tends to unbend the field lines . indeed when the field is strong so that the magnetic energy dominates the kinematic one , the gas is constraint to flow along the field lines .",
    "an important consequence of this mechanism is that no correlation between the magnetic intensity and the density is expected in hi .",
    "this result first obtained in 1d by hennebelle & prault ( 2000 ) ( see also passot & vzquez - semadeni 2003 ) has been confirmed in 3d simulations by de avillez & breitschwerdt ( 2005 ) .",
    "since magnetic and kinematical energies are roughly comparable in the hi , one expects magnetic field fluctuations to be important .",
    "we have therefore explored analytically and numerically the influence of alfvn waves on thermal instability ( hennebelle & passot 2006 ) . in particular an exact stability analysis of a non - linear",
    "circularly polarized alfvn wave , of wavelength @xmath4 , propagating in a thermally unstable medium has been worked out .",
    "the conclusions of this analysis are i ) wavelengths larger than @xmath4 are generally stabilized against thermal instability by the alfvn wave , ii ) wavelengths slightly smaller than @xmath4 are generally destabilized and even more prone to thermal instability .",
    "this is a consequence of the parametric instability studied by goldstein ( 1978 ) .",
    "iii ) the wavelengths much smaller than @xmath4 are not affected by the alfvn wave . in order to confirm these results and to explore the non linear regime ,",
    "we have performed 1d numerical simulations .",
    "we setup a density perturbation into a thermally unstable gas that we let evolve .",
    "left panel of figure 3 shows that the perturbation has condensed and formed a cnm structure .",
    "when an alfvn wave is added , right panel of figure 3 shows that the evolution is drastically different . instead of one ,",
    "about 10 small structures of cnm have formed .",
    "this is because as shown by the analytical calculations , the waves have triggered the growth of smaller wavelengths .",
    "this mechanism together with turbulence ( audit & hennebelle 2005 ) is likely to play an important rle in the formation of the small scale cnm structures recently observed by braun & kanekar ( 2005 ) and stanimirovi & heiles ( 2005 )"
