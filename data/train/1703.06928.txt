    "one of the most remarkable properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the color confinement phenomenon that makes hadrons to be built out of color singlets of quarks .",
    "the simplest way to build a color neutral baryon ( half - integer spin ) state is out of three quarks ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , qcd tells us that there are other ways to build color neutral baryons , for example : hybrid baryons with gluonic components ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ,  ) , pentaquarks ( @xmath5 ) , heptaquarks ( @xmath6 ) and so on . finding complete multiplets of baryons beyond the @xmath2 picture is one of the main goals of hadron spectroscopy and will provide insight on the dynamics of qcd in the hadronic energy regime .",
    "the recent discovery of two structures compatible with pentaquark states in the @xmath7 decay by lhcb  @xcite together with the observation of a compatible structure in @xmath8  @xcite , has triggered a lot of research activities aimed to explain them . each signal has been associated to a pentaquark candidate , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with opposite parity assignments , and one state having spin @xmath11 and the other @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 signal is less apparent and the properties of this state ( mass and width ) could depend on the amplitude analysis performed , especially for the @xmath13 background  @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath10 signal is very narrow and its mass and width are not expected to change by refinements in the amplitude analysis .",
    "hence , its study has been the focus of many research groups .",
    "several explanations for this signal have been proposed : a kinematical effect  @xcite , a molecular state  @xcite and a compact qcd ( pentaquark ) state  @xcite .",
    "one of the best approaches to gain insight on the nature of @xmath10 consists on detecting the state in a different reaction . in",
    "@xcite it was proposed to use @xmath14 photoproduction . from the lhcb @xmath15 decay data we know that the @xmath10 state couples strongly to the @xmath14 , and the photon energy can be tuned to excite this particular state .",
    "this experiment has just been approved to run at hall c in jefferson lab  @xcite and results are expected in the next years .",
    "hence , as a first step it is necessary to develop the amplitudes that will be needed to provide realistic predictions for the planning of the experiment and later to analyze the experimental data . in the next section we sketch the main features of the @xmath16 photoproduction model that we developed with these purposes in mind . the detailed description of the model and the corresponding results can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the differential cross section for the @xmath17 reaction can be written @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the incoming momentum , @xmath20 is the outgoing momentum , @xmath21 is the scattering angle , @xmath22 is the standard mandelstam variable , @xmath23 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the @xmath16 , outgoing proton , photon and incoming proton helicities respectively .",
    "all the kinematical variables are defined in the center of mass reference system .",
    "the amplitude @xmath28 is constructed as the addition of two pieces : ( i ) the pentaquark resonance as a breit  wigner amplitude @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the @xmath10 mass , width and helicity respectively , @xmath33 is the invariant mass , @xmath34 stands for the strong vertex @xmath35 , and @xmath36 stands for the electromagnetic vertex @xmath37 ; and ( ii ) a nonresonant background described through an affective pomeron exchange that is constrained by existing high - energy data  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the standard mandelstam variable , @xmath40 is the minimum @xmath39 for a given @xmath22 , @xmath41 is the hadron physics scale , @xmath42 is the pomeron regge trajectory whose parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 are fitted to the data , and @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are also fitted to the data .",
    "the electromagnetic vertex can be related to the helicity amplitudes @xmath48 and @xmath49 through @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the nucleon mass and @xmath52 is the momentum @xmath19 evaluated at the resonance mass @xmath30 .",
    "we do not know the helicity amplitudes of the pentaquark , hence , we need to make assumptions to describe this piece of the model .",
    "we assume the electromagnetic and strong vertices to be related by vector meson dominance @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the @xmath16 mass and decay constant respectively , and @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the wigner @xmath58-functions with @xmath59 the resonance spin , and @xmath60 are the helicity couplings .",
    "we assume the three helicity couplings to be equal , @xmath61 .",
    "hence the partial decay width @xmath62 reads @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the @xmath65 branching ratio and @xmath66 the @xmath20 momentum at the resonance peak . since there are no data in the resonance peak region we can only determine an upper limit for @xmath64 within a certain confidence level ( cl ) to ensure compatibility with the available data .",
    "we fit the available data on the @xmath17 reaction for @xmath67 @xcite and we compute the uncertainties in the parameters up to 68% and 95% cl using the bootstrap technique @xcite .",
    "we also incorporate the uncertainty of the pentaquark mass and width through a monte carlo . in this way we can propagate exactly the experimental uncertainties to our predictions .",
    "figure  [ fig : dxs ] shows the differential cross section @xmath68 at @xmath69 in the pentaquark energy region for the @xmath70 and @xmath71 spin - parity assignments .",
    "the pentaquark peak is very pronounced , which implies that , if the lhcb signal is a true resonance and does not couple too weakly to the photon ( as expected from vector meson dominance ) , it will be visible in the proposed photoproduction experiment at jefferson lab  @xcite .",
    "we found that data allow for the existence of a pentaquark whose @xmath72 branching ratio has to be below 30% for @xmath73 and below 17% for @xmath74 at a 95% cl .",
    "the values of the parameters , their uncertainties , and the full extent of the analysis can be found in  @xcite .",
    "peak region at @xmath69 for the @xmath75 ( left plot ) and the @xmath76 ( right plot ) spin - parity assignments . ]     peak region at @xmath69 for the @xmath75 ( left plot ) and the @xmath76 ( right plot ) spin - parity assignments . ]",
    "the signals found in the @xmath7 decay by the lhcb collaboration  @xcite indicate the possible existence of a hidden charm pentaquark with a mass of @xmath77 .",
    "one of the most promising ways to independently confirm the pentaquark nature of the signal consists on trying to photoproduce the state using the @xmath78 reaction . the recent approval by jefferson lab s pac44 of this very experiment at hall c  @xcite and the development of photoproduction models to analize the data  @xcite make us believe that in the near future we will get a clear answer .",
    "the codes for the model in  @xcite can be downloaded and run online from the joint physics analysis center ( jpac ) web page  @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath10 state is also detected in @xmath16 photoproduction , it would likely be a compact state .",
    "then , new experiments aimed to hunt the other members of this hidden - charm pentaquark multiplet can begin  @xcite as well as experiments to map the @xmath79 dependence of the pentaquark electromagnetic form factor and provide insight into its internal structure .",
