    "charge density waves ( cdw ) have been a subject of considerable interest in condensed matter physics for many decades.@xcite originally expected and observed in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , cdw formation was found also in many 2d materials where the ordered state remains metallic in most of the cases . occasionally , the cdw phase is in close proximity to other phases such as superconductivity.@xcite    the rare - earth tritellurides@xcite @xmath5te@xmath0 are excellent model systems for systematic studies of the underlying physics for the wide range of tunable parameters such as transition temperature @xmath6 , fermi surface shape , @xmath7-axis coupling , anisotropic or weak versus strong electron - phonon coupling.@xcite these compounds have an orthorhombic crystal structure ( @xmath8 space group ) commonly thought of as being weakly orthorhombic , i.e. tetragonal with a 2-fold reduced symmetry due the very subtle difference of the in - plane crystal axes.@xcite for the layered quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) material with the reduced tetragonal symmetry , the cdw ground state can either be bidirectional ( checkerboard ) or unidirectional ( stripes).@xcite high resolution x - ray diffraction,@xcite angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes)@xcite and femtosecond pump - probe spectroscopy@xcite showed that lighter rare - earth tritellurides ( i.e. @xmath9 ) host an unidirectional incommensurate cdw well above room temperature . for the heavy rare - earth tritellurides ( i.e. @xmath10 )",

    "the absorbed laser power ranged from 1 to 2mw to keep the local heating below 5k in the @xmath13-sized focus .",
    "the spectra were measured with a resolution of 2.5@xmath14 at low energy and 20@xmath14 at high energy .",

    "the absence of the q or q@xmath32 peaks on the main diagonal in fig .",

    "the absence of the 2q@xmath32 peak off the main diagonals in figs .",
    "[ fig_4 ] ( c ) and [ fig_4 ] ( d ) is a consequence of applying fourier transform to the images scanned over a small area and , off course , a consequence of low signal - to - noise ratio , rather than a consequence of the modification of the carrier density modulation .",
    "it is , therefore , natural to assume that only carrier density modulation , lattice features and , as explained , their interplay have an impact on the formation of the image in figs . [ fig_4 ] ( a ) and [ fig_4 ] ( b ) , and that the effect of the convolution of the surface with a",
    " bad  tip can be ruled out .",
    "having in mind that the fourier images in figs .",
    "[ fig_4 ] ( c ) and [ fig_4 ] ( d ) have the same periodic components , one can conjecture that different motifs observed in the topography and current images originate from the different intensities of the fourier peaks .",
    "in fact , the strong cdw stripe motif in the topography image is due to the fact that the q peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] ( c ) have higher intensity than the a peaks .",
    "oppositely , the current image does not have strong cdw stripe motif because the q peaks have significantly lower intensity than the rest of the peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] ( d ) . on the other hand , the shapes in fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] ( a ) and the n and v shapes in fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] ( b ) are mainly determined by the intensity of the q@xmath32 , a and a@xmath32 peaks .",
    "the  modulation  features on the side diagonals of the fourier images may exist due to both carrier density modulation and structural modulation ( rearrangement ) of the te sheet atoms .",
    "if we were to assume that there is no structural modulation , than the intensity of the aforementioned peaks would be determined by the strength of the tunneling signal from the carrier density modulation components with the corresponding periodicity .",
    "if the structural modulation is considered without the carrier density modulation , than the intensity of the related peaks would be determined by the magnitude of the atom displacements .",
    "larger displacements would yield fourier peaks with high intensity , but would also introduce asymmetry in the intensity of the  modulation  peaks across the side diagonal .",
    "such asymmetry is seen as unequal intensity of the q@xmath32 peaks on the side diagonals in figs .",
    "[ fig_4 ] ( c ) and [ fig_4 ] ( d )",
    ". similar asymmetry of the q@xmath32 peak intensities can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ( b ) .",
    "the q@xmath32 peaks on side diagonals in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ( b ) are , however , weaker in comparison to a and q peaks , which is why the corresponding topography looks like a square te lattice to which the carrier density modulation and its components are added .",
    "therefore , the structural modulation seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] ( b ) most probably exists also in figs .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ( b ) and [ fig_4 ] ( a ) but it is masked by contribution of the other periodic components included in the formation on these images .    finally , further examination of fourier images in figs .",
    "[ fig_3 ] ( a ) , [ fig_4 ] ( c ) and [ fig_4 ] ( d ) indicates the existence of higher order harmonics ( marked by red rectangles in the mentioned figures ) which appear to be located at the positions corresponding to the linear combinations of the lattice and the modulation wavevectors .",
    "hence , one could speculate that these higher order harmonics might be an indication of a structural modulation occurring in the te sheets . however , the intensity of these peaks is very low , especially in figs .",
    "[ fig_3 ] ( a ) and [ fig_4 ] ( c ) , and comparable to the noise level .",
    "unfortunately , we find that takeing larger scans than those shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_4 ] ( a ) and [ fig_4 ] ( b ) does not improve signal - to - noise ratio for the higher harmonics at room temperature , but rather leads to an unstable operation in which the topography and the current images change their appearance after a certain time of scanning .",
    "this leaves the existence of higher harmonics as an open question .",
    "the formation of energy gaps is a general characteristic of the cdw systems . in these systems a broken symmetry ground state ( cdw state )",
    "is stabilized via electron - electron or electron - phonon interactions or both , by creating electron - hole pairs with the ordering vector selected as explained in section [ s3_2 ] .",
    "this , in turn , leads to the energy gap formation in the regions of the fermi surface connected by the preselected ordering vector , thus , lowering the energy of the system . for @xmath5te@xmath0 family",

    "the averaging procedure was done due to the spatial variation on @xmath52 curves at random points , including ones above and in between the te sheet atoms .",
    "the asymmetry of the @xmath53 curve originates from the fact that , apart from the in - plane @xmath26 and @xmath27 orbitals , the @xmath28 orbitals are probed as well.@xcite removal of electrons from @xmath28 , which occurs at negative voltages , is more favourable than the adding of electrons at positive voltages since the @xmath28 orbitals are below the fermi level .",
    "therefore , the conductance , i.e. @xmath53 , will be higher for negative than for positive voltages and , consequently , the @xmath53 curve would be asymmetric .",
    "this type of @xmath53 asymmetry is common among systems exhibiting cdw.@xcite the v - shaped @xmath53 curve with a depressed dos inside the gap and a finite conductance at zero bias suggest a partially gapped fermi surface , as it was noted before .",
    "the v - shape becomes apparent after magnification of the @xmath53 inside the gap ( see the lower inset in fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] ) .",
    "the spatial variation of @xmath52 curves , in the upper inset , is probably the reason why the average @xmath53 exhibits subtle kinks marked by ( red ) stars in fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] .",
    "for each kink in the @xmath53 curve one can observe a slope in the corresponding @xmath55 curve which , indeed , corroborates that the kinks exist .",
    "these variations are likely due to involvement of the tip states , due some other effect such as zero bias anomaly , @xcite or even maybe due to the existence of the shadow gaps in cete@xmath0.@xcite similar structures can be observed in ref . .",
    "unfortunately , we can not claim with certainty what they represent nor determine their origin .",
    "exceptions are the two features at @xmath56ev and @xmath57ev , additionally marked by dashed lines , which correspond to the most prominent slopes of @xmath55 and which seem to be present in the most of the measurements . in fact , they represent the bands edges rising above and below the fermi level , and , therefore , correspond to the cdw gap which originates from hybridization between original and shadow bands .",

    "[ fig_5 ] ) in that the energy observed by light scattering is approximately a factor of two smaller than expected from tunneling . speculatively , one may associate the second maximum found in the @xmath67-polarized raman spectra with a hidden transition having a marginally different ordering wave vector and a slightly lower minimum of the free energy , as suggested in refs .  . however , the selection rules are more indicative of an ordering wave vector orthogonal to the first one ( see gapped @xmath68 spectrum _ versus _ peaked @xmath67 spectrum in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : raman ] ) and argue otherwise .",
    "hence , the maximum at @xmath73 can not be explained .",
    "scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy were used for an investigation of the cdw state in cete@xmath0 .",
    "the data was acquired at room temperature . using raman spectroscopy we confirmed that cete@xmath0 is in the cdw state at room temperature .",
    "the stm topography images clearly show the presence of the cdw modulation .",
    "this fact is supported by spectroscopy curves , which indicate that cdw band gap has a value of @xmath74ev and are in good agrement with gap value of @xmath75ev obtained from raman measurements .",
    "the analysis of the fourier transform images showed two main peaks along the direction of the cdw .",
    "one representing the dominant cdw modulation wavevector , located at @xmath2 , and the other one , @xmath76 , interpreted as a consequence of the wavevector mixing effect .",
    "the other peaks , which are not related to the te sheet atoms and ce subsurface atoms are related both to the mixing effect and possible structural modulations of the te sheet atoms .",
    "the current images indicate periodic patterns of te sheet atoms grouped in n and v shapes , which were not previously observed by stm .",
