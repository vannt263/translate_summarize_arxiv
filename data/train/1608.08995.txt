    "the behavioral ecology of all organisms is influenced by the energetic state of individuals , which directly influences how they invest reserves in uncertain environments .",
    "such behaviors are generally manifested as tradeoffs between investing in somatic maintenance and growth , or allocating energy towards reproduction  @xcite .",
    "the timing of these behaviors responds to selective pressure , as the choice of the investment impacts future fitness  @xcite .",
    "the influence of resource limitation on an organism s ability to maintain its nutritional stores may lead to repeated delays or shifts in reproduction over the course of an organism s life .    the balance between ( a ) somatic growth and maintenance , and ( b ) reproduction depends on resource availability  @xcite .",
    "for example , reindeer invest less in calves born after harsh winters ( when the mother s energetic state is depleted ) than in calves born after moderate winters  @xcite .",
    "many bird species invest differently in broods during periods of resource scarcity compared to normal periods  @xcite , sometimes delaying or even foregoing reproduction for a breeding season  @xcite .",
    "even freshwater and marine zooplankton have been observed to avoid reproduction under nutritional stress  @xcite , and those that do reproduce have lower survival rates  @xcite .",
    "organisms may also separate maintenance and growth from reproduction over space and time : many salmonids , birds , and some mammals return to migratory breeding grounds to reproduce after one or multiple seasons in resource - rich environments where they accumulate nutritional reserves  @xcite .",
    "physiology also plays an important role in regulating reproductive expenditures during periods of resource limitation .",
    "the data collected thus far has shown that diverse mammals ( 47 species in 10 families ) exhibit delayed implantation , whereby females postpone fetal development ( blastocyst implantation ) until nutritional reserves can be accumulated  @xcite .",
    "many other many species ( including humans ) suffer irregular menstrual cycling and higher abortion rates during periods of nutritional stress  @xcite . in the extreme case of unicellular organisms ,",
    "nutrition is unavoidably linked to reproduction because the nutritional state of the cell regulates all aspects of the cell cycle @xcite .",
    "the existence of so many independently evolved mechanisms across such a diverse suite of organisms highlights the importance and universality of the fundamental tradeoff between somatic and reproductive investment .",
    "however the general dynamic implications of these constraints are unknown .    though straightforward conceptually , incorporating the energetic dynamics of individuals  @xcite into a population - level framework  @xcite presents numerous mathematical obstacles  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach involves modeling the macroscale relations that guide somatic versus reproductive investment in a consumer - resource system .",
    "for example , macroscale lotka - volterra models assume that the growth rate of the consumer population depends on resource density , thus _ implicitly _ incorporating the requirement of resource availability for reproduction  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we adopt an alternative approach in which we _ explicitly _ account for resource limitation and the subsequent effects of starvation .",
    "namely , only individuals with sufficient energetic reserves can reproduce .",
    "such a constraint leads to reproductive time lags due to some members of the population going hungry and then recovering .",
    "additionally , we incorporate the idea that reproduction is strongly constrained allometrically @xcite , and is not generally linearly related to resource density .",
    "as we shall show , these constraints influence the ensuing population dynamics in dramatic ways .",
    "we begin by defining a minimal nutritional state - structured population model ( nsm ) , where the consumer population is partitioned into two states : ( a ) an energetically replete ( full ) state @xmath2 , where the consumer reproduces at a constant rate @xmath3 and does not die from starvation , and ( b ) an energetically deficient ( hungry ) state @xmath4 , where the consumer does not reproduce but dies by starvation at rate @xmath5 .",
    "the underlying resource @xmath6 evolves by logistic growth with an intrinsic growth rate @xmath7 and a carrying capacity equal to one .",
    "consumers transition from the full state @xmath2 to the hungry state @xmath4 at a rate @xmath8the starvation rate  and also in proportion to the absence of resources @xmath9 .",
    "conversely , consumers recover from state @xmath4 to state @xmath2 at rate @xmath10 and in proportion to @xmath6 .",
    "resources are also eaten by the consumers  at rate @xmath10 by hungry consumers and at rate @xmath11 by full consumers .",
    "this inequality accounts for hungry consumers requiring more resources to replace lost body tissue .",
    "the nsm represents a fundamental extension of the idealized starving random walk model of foraging , which focuses on resource depletion , to include reproduction and resource replenishment  @xcite .        in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "in which the consumers and resources are perfectly mixed , their densities evolve according to the rate equations @xmath12 notice that the total consumer density @xmath13 evolves according to @xmath14 .",
    "this resembles the equation of motion for the predator density in the classic lotka - volterra model  @xcite , except that the resource density does not appear in the growth term . as discussed above ,",
    "the attributes of reproduction and mortality have been explicitly apportioned to the full and hungry consumers , respectively , so that the growth in the total density is decoupled from the resource density .",
    "equation   has three fixed points : two trivial fixed points at @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and one non - trivial , internal fixed point at @xmath17 the stability of this fixed point is determined by the jacobian matrix @xmath18 , where each matrix element @xmath19 when evaluated at the internal fixed point , and @xmath20 is the vector @xmath21 .",
    "the parameters in eq .",
    "are such that the real part of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath22 is negative , so that the system is stable with respect to small perturbations from the fixed point . because this fixed point is unique , it is the global attractor for all population trajectories for any initial condition where the resource and consumer densities are both nonzero .    from eq .",
    ", an obvious constraint on the nsm is that the reproduction rate @xmath3 must be less than the starvation rate @xmath8 , so that @xmath23 is positive .",
    "in fact , when the resource density @xmath24 , the rate equation for @xmath2 gives exponential growth of @xmath2 for @xmath25 . the condition @xmath26 represents a transcritical ( tc ) bifurcation  @xcite that demarcates the physical regime from the unphysical regime where @xmath2 would grow exponentially with time .",
    "the biological implication of the constraint @xmath27 has a simple interpretation  the rate at which a macroscopic organism loses mass due to lack of resources is generally much faster than the rate of reproduction . as we will discuss below",
    ", this inequality is a natural consequence of allometric constraints  @xcite for organisms within empirically observed body size ranges .    in the physical regime of @xmath27 , the fixed point",
    "may either be a stable node or a limit cycle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fp ] ) . in continuous - time systems , a limit cycle arises when a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues crosses the imaginary axis to attain positive real parts  @xcite .",
    "this hopf bifurcation is defined by @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the sylvester matrix , which is composed of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the jacobian matrix  @xcite . as",
    "the system parameters are tuned to be within the stable regime but close to the hopf bifurcation , the amplitude of the transient but decaying cycles become large . given that ecological systems are constantly being perturbed  @xcite ,",
    "the onset of transient cycles , even though they decay with time in the mean - field description , can increase the extinction risk  @xcite .",
    "thus the distance of a system from the hopf bifurcation provides a measure of its persistence .    when the starvation rate @xmath30 , a substantial fraction of the consumers are driven to the hungry non - reproducing state .",
    "because reproduction is inhibited , there is a low steady - state consumer density and a high steady - state resource density .",
    "however , if @xmath31 from above , the population is overloaded with energetically - replete ( reproducing ) individuals , thereby promoting oscillations between the consumer and resource densities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fp ] ) .    whereas the relation between consumer growth rate @xmath3 and the starvation rate @xmath8 defines an absolute bound of biological feasibility ",
    "the tc bifurcation@xmath8 also determines the sensitivity of the consumer population to changes in resource density . when @xmath30 , the steady - state population density is small , thereby increasing the risk of stochastic extinction . on the other hand , as @xmath8 decreases ,",
    "the system will ultimately be poised either near the tc or the hopf bifurcation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fp ] ) .",
    "if the recovery rate @xmath10 is sufficiently small , the tc bifurcation is reached and the resource eventually is eliminated .",

    "since only certain tissues can be digested for energy ( for example the brain can not be degraded to fuel metabolism ) , we define the rates for starvation , death , and recovery by the timescales required to reach , or return from , specific fractions of the replete - state mass ( fig . [",

    "we define @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the fraction of replete - state mass where reproduction ceases .",

    "it should be noted that more complicated ontogenetic models explicitly handle storage @xcite , whereas this feature is implicitly covered by the body fat scaling in our framework .    to determine the starvation rate , @xmath8 , we are interested in the time required for an organism to go from a mature adult that reproduces at rate @xmath3 , to a reduced - mass hungry state where reproduction is impossible . for starving individuals",
    "we assume that an organism must meet its maintenance requirements using the digestion of existing mass as the sole energy source .",
    "this assumption implies the following simple metabolic balance @xmath76 or @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the amount of energy stored in a unit of existing body mass which differs from @xmath46 , the energy required to synthesis a unit of biomass @xcite .",

    "investigating other classes of organisms would simply involve altering the metabolic exponents and scalings associate with @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , we emphasize that our allometric equations describe mean relationships , and do not account for the ( sometimes considerable ) variance associated with individual species .",

    "statistically significant support for the existence of population cycles among mammals is predominantly based on time series for small mammals  @xcite , in agreement with our predictions of more pronounced transient dynamics , given how close these points are to the hopf bifurcation .",
    "on the other hand , the longer gestational times and the increased difficulty in measurements , precludes obtaining similar - quality data for larger organisms .",
    "within our model , higher rates of starvation result in a larger flux of the population to the hungry state . in this state reproduction",

    "we therefore examine the competing effects of cyclic dynamics vs.  changes in steady state density on extinction risk as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath10 . to this end , we computed the probability of extinction , where we define extinction as a population trajectory falling below one tenth of the allometrically constrained steady state at any time between @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",

    "this result if remarkable because it illustrates that the steady state values of the nsm combined with the derived timescales naturally give rise to the energy equivalence result .",

    "we contend that the nsm provides a mechanistic understanding of the energetic dynamics that give rise to both observed limitations on mammalian body size as well as the observed trend towards larger body size over evolutionary time .",
    "the nsm predicts that the steady state resource density @xmath122 decreases with increasing body size of the consumer population ( fig .",

    "it is important to note the exponent , because it not only defines several scalings in our framework but also the value of the metabolic normalization constant , @xmath148 , given a set of data . for mammals the metabolic normalization",
    "constant has been reported to vary between @xmath149 ( w g@xmath150 ) and @xmath151 ( w g@xmath150 ) @xcite , where the former value represents basal metabolic rate and the latter represents the field metabolic rate .",
    "we employ the field metabolic rate for our nsm model which is appropriate for active mammals ( table 1 ) .",
    "the energy to synthesize a unit of biomass , @xmath46 , has been reported to vary between @xmath152 to @xmath153 ( j g@xmath154 ) ( e.g. @xcite ) in mammals with a mean value across many taxonomic groups of @xmath155 ( j g@xmath154 ) @xcite .",
    "the unit energy available during starvation , @xmath156 , could range between @xmath157 ( j g@xmath154 ) , the return of the total energy stored during ontogeny @xcite to a biochemical upper bound of @xmath158 ( j g@xmath154 ) for the energetics of palmitate @xcite .",
    "for our calculations we use the measured value for bulk tissues of @xmath157 which assumes that the energy stored during ontogeny is returned during starvation @xcite .    for the scaling of body composition",
    "it has been shown that fat mass follows @xmath68 , with measured relationships following @xmath159 @xcite , @xmath160 @xcite , and @xmath161 @xcite .",
    "we use the values from @xcite which falls in the middle of this range .",
    "similarly , the muscle mass follows @xmath86 with @xmath162 and @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "the final parameters that we must consider connect the resource growth rate to the total metabolic rate of an organism .",
    "that is , we are interested in the relative rates of resource recovery and consumption by the total population . from @xcite the total resource use of a population with an individual body size of @xmath33 is given by @xmath164 ( w m@xmath165 ) .",
    "considering an energy density of @xmath166 ( j g@xmath154 ) of grass @xcite and an npp between and @xmath167 and @xmath168 ( g s@xmath154 m@xmath165 ) would give a range of resource rates between @xmath169 and @xmath170 ( w m@xmath165 ) .",
    "this gives a ratio of total resource consumption to supply rates between @xmath171 and @xmath172 , and we used a value of @xmath173 in our calculations and simulations .",
    "if an invading subset of the resident population of mass @xmath33 has an altered mass @xmath174 where @xmath133 varies between @xmath175 $ ] ( @xmath176 denotes a leaner invader ; @xmath135 denotes an invader with more endogenous reserves ) , the invading population will have the following modified rates : @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 . because we are assuming that the invading population is only modifying its endogenous energetic stores , we assume that the proportion of body mass that is non - adipose tissue remains the same as the resident population .",
    "this assumption leads to the following modified timescales :          m.  e. moses , c.  hou , w.  h. woodruff , g.  b. west , j.  c. nekola , w.  zuo , and j.  h. brown , `` revisiting a model of ontogenetic growth : estimating model parameters from theory and data , '' _",
