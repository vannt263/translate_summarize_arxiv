    "@xmath6 , @xmath9 , and @xmath8 can be measured from the light curve . a common way to measure @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "is by comparing the stellar spectrum to stellar atmosphere models , allowing to derive the stellar parameters ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , [ fe / h ] ) used to obtain the stellar mass and radius .",
    "@xmath4 can also be measured more precisely , and without the use of models , with interferometry , or with transit fitting ( in the case of high precision light curves ) .",
    "improving the precision on observational planet masses and radii is important for both planet structure and planet formation models .",
    "the internal structure of a planet can be studied by comparing its mass and radius to model predictions of planets with different composition .",
    "determining planet structure is important to derive observational statistics on planet types , which can then be compared to the predictions of planet formation models .",
    "@xcite show that to determinate the composition of sub - uranus planets , error bars of 2% on the planet parameters are required .",
    "the current uncertainties on planet masses and radii are of the order of 10% .",
    "improving these measurements is thus vital to help confirm the models .      the uncertainties on the planet mass , radius , and inclination depend on the uncertainties on the host star mass and radius , on the uncertainties on the transit parameters ( @xmath6 , total transit duration ) , and on the uncertainties on the radial velocity measurements .",
    "for large planets ( @xmath13jupiter ) , the uncertainties on the planet mass and radius are mainly due to the uncertainties on the stellar parameters . for sub - uranus planets around active stars ,",
    "the uncertainties on the planet mass and radius can be dominated by the uncertainties on the transit parameters .",
    "active stars shows intrinsic flux variations due to temporal evolution and rotational modulation of structures on their surface ( stellar spots , plages , granulation ) .",
    "intrinsic stellar variations can have amplitudes much greater than transits , and thus , can hinder transit detection .",
    "these variations occur at a lower frequency ( longer time length ) than transit events ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , fig . 3.2 ) ) .",

    "we tested the effect of @xcite pre - detection filter on the transit signal of 20 simulated light - curves , produced for the corot blind test exercise 2 ( bt2 , @xcite ) .",
    "the three main components in these light - curves are the stellar variability , the transit signal , and the instrumental noise .",

    "miss - estimating the transit depth and duration leads to a miss - estimation of the planet radius , and orbital inclination ( used to derive the planet mass ) .",

    "+ we estimate the stellar variability by applying @xcite pre - detection filter .",
    "we subtract the estimation from the original light curve , phase - fold the result , and bin it to reduce the random noise .",

    "the best estimation of the transit signal is the original light curve minus the last estimation of the stellar variability ( after 3 - 4 iterations ) .",
    "we have applied the iterative stellar variability filter described in section [ secimp ] , on 20 corot bt2 light - curves with transits .",
    "iterating on the estimation of the stellar variability , and using the additional knowledge on the orbital period , appears to successfully better recover the original transit shape ( compare bottom of figure [ fig2 ] with _ bottom plot _ of figure [ fig1]b ) . on average , light curves filtered with the iterative filter gives a better estimation of the transit depth by 15% and of the transit duration by 10% , than when filtered with @xcite pre - detection filter .",
    "+ the iterative filter has also been found efficient in reconstructing shallow transits that had become un - detectable after pre - detection stellar variability filtering .",
    "another use for the iterative filter could thus be to confirm borderline transit detections in active stars .",
    "based on 20 simulated corot light curves from the bt2 light curve sample , we have shown that @xcite pre - detection filter , used to remove stellar variability prior to transit detection , deforms the transit depth by 20% and the transit duration by 15% . to circumvent this ,",
