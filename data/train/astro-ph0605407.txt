    "among gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , `` optically dark '' bursts are known as grbs without accompanying optical transients . from lack of a precise location",
    "being usually determined by its optical afterglow , it is generally difficult to search out its corresponding host galaxy",
    ". hence there are only a few hosts found to date by radio counterparts for this kind of bursts , and detailed studies such as their morphology or taxonomy are very premature .",
    "why are these grbs `` optically dark '' ?",
    "the answer is still unclear .",
    "their optical counterparts might have decayed much rapidly than others , and/or could be hidden behind heavily absorbing matters .",
    "some works suggest that those are associated with dusty molecular clouds along the line of sight @xcite or distant grbs with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in soft x - ray band , measuring the absorptions in spectra of prompt emissions and/or afterglows from grbs could provide us important information about the environments around sources .",
    "actually some authors reported time - variable absorptions in spectra of some grb prompt emissions and afterglows .",
    "one of the interesting properties of grb970828 is a time - variable absorption in the spectra of the afterglow , which could be due to circum - burst medium @xcite .",
    "similar absorption in the afterglows were also reported by @xcite and @xcite .    for prompt emissions ,",
    "time - variable absorptions were reported for grb980329 @xcite , grb990705 @xcite and grb010222 @xcite .",
    "optical counterparts were found for these bursts , in contrast to the case for grb970828 .",
    "@xcite suggested that a time - variable absorption in the spectra of grb980329 was due to the internal shock accompanied by the expanding fireball . for grb990705 ,",
    "an absorption feature in the prompt emission might be explained by a photoelectric absorption by a medium at z=0.86 @xcite .",
    "we report here constant absorptions throughout the prompt emission and the afterglow of grb051022 observed respectively by hete-2 and swift .",
    "we also present the localization and the spectral properties of grb051022 .",
    "we discuss output energies of the burst and an evidence for an intervening dense medium along the line of sight .",
    "the gamma - ray burst grb051022 was detected with the three scientific instruments aboard hete-2 , the wide - field x - ray monitor ( wxm ; 2 - 25 kev ; @xcite ) , soft x - ray camera ( sxc ; 0.5 - 10 kev ; @xcite ) and french gamma telescope ( fregate : 6 - 400 kev ; @xcite ) , at 13:07:58 on 22 october 2005 @xcite .",
    "the location of grb051022 was determined immediately by the flight wxm and sxc localization system .",
    "the gcn notices reporting the position were sent out 45 seconds after the onset based on the wxm flight localization , and 119 seconds after the onset based on the sxc flight localization .",
    "the wxm location was a circle centered at @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( j2000 ) with a radius of @xmath8 ( 90 % confidence region ) by the ground analysis of the data .",
    "the brightness of grb051022 was sufficient in soft x - rays to determine the position with an error radius down to @xmath9 using the sxc data independently of the wxm localization .",
    "unfortunately the sxc data was partially lost due to the dropout of internet connection to the ground station at cayenne .",
    "the sxc localization was made by the ground analysis and resulted in a circle centered at @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( j2000 ) ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) with a radius of @xmath14 ( 90 % confidence region ) .",
    "the inter - planetary network ( ipn ) also reported its position @xcite constrained on an annulus centered at @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( j2000 ) with a radius of 46.4533@xmath170.0684 degrees ( the quoted error is 3@xmath18 confidence region ) .",
    "the sxc error circle was just encompassed in this annulus position .",
    "the swift xrt instrument began observing 3.5 hours after the trigger the field of grb051022 based on the hete-2 localization , and detected a bright unknown fading x - ray source @xcite , just @xmath19 away from the center of the sxc error circle .",
    "the xrt located it with an accuracy of @xmath20 and the chandra narrowed later its error region down to @xmath21 @xcite , where the vla observation at 8.5ghz discovered a bright radio source @xcite .",
    "the probable host galaxy was reported by several groups @xcite , and the optical spectroscopic observation using the 200-inch hale telescope at palomar observatory detected a strong line at 6736 @xmath22 which corresponds to o@xmath23 3727 @xmath22 and determined a redshift @xmath0 @xcite .    using the data of swift xrt instrument , spectral analyses of x - ray afterglow were performed ( @xcite , ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported the absorption @xmath24 @xmath2 which is greater than the galactic value in the direction to the burst .",
    "the light curve of x - ray afterglow presented a break at t@xmath25 days , and the jet opening angles were estimated @xcite if this break was due to the sideway expansion ; @xmath26 degrees for the hete-2 spectral parameters @xcite and @xmath27 degrees for the konus - wind spectral parameters @xcite .      unfortunately , because of the dropout of internet connection to our ground station at cayenne at the trigger time , we lost the time tagged photon data of the fregate .",
    "the spectral and temporal analyses of the fregate are performed using the 5.24 s resolution data from this reason .",
    "the upper five panels in figure [ lc_par ] show the time history of grb051022 in five energy bands , where @xmath28 shows the trigger time which corresponds to 13:07:58 on 22 october 2005 ut . the event consists of multiple pulses and has a rather long duration @xmath29 s in the 2@xmath3025 kev energy band and @xmath31 s in the 30@xmath30400 kev energy band .      in our analysis",
    ", we use the following models : power - law ( pl ) , power - law times exponential cutoff ( ple ) and band function ( grbm ; @xcite ) . the wxm and the fregate were pointed to around @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( j2000 ) ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) when the grb was observed .",
    "the fregate has larger field - of - view of 70 degrees than that of the wxm , and we found many mildly bright soft sources at that time within the fregate field - of - view but outside the wxm consulting the asm / rxte database .",
    "the spectrum of fregate shows somewhat larger counts near its lower energy end than those from the wxm in the same band .",
    "this could be due to contamination from the soft sources mentioned above . to avoid this discrepancy only in the lower end of energy band of the fregate",
    ", we employ data above 40 kev up to 400 kev for joint fits and find very good agreement in continuum spectra with the wxm and the fregate .",
    "first of all , we analyze the average spectrum of the prompt emission using the total duration t @xmath36 21@xmath30220 s. for background we employ data during t @xmath36 231@xmath30341 s. their time regions are indicated in figure [ lc_par ] .",
    "any unabsorbed model does not provide an acceptable fit to the data .",
    "we find a deficit of photons in the spectrum using unabsorbed grbm model in lower energy band below 4 kev ( see panel ( b ) of figure [ spectra ] ) .",
    "the galactic value of absorption in the direction of the burst is @xmath37 @xmath2 @xcite , which is negligible for this fit .",
    "then , we adopt an absorption as a free parameter and fit the data .",
    "the fit is clearly improved ( see panel ( c ) of figure [ spectra ] ) and the most favorable model is the absorbed grbm with @xmath38 @xmath36 @xmath39 @xmath2 . using the absorbed grbm model , we find @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 kev , and fluences @xmath43 @xmath36 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 ( 2@xmath3030 kev ) and @xmath47 @xmath36 @xmath48 @xmath45 @xmath46 ( 30@xmath30400 kev ) .",
    "the quoted errors correspond to the 90 % confidence region for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and the 68 % confidence region for @xmath43 and @xmath47 .",
    "thus the ratio of fluences is log(@xmath43/@xmath47 ) @xmath36 @xmath300.786 , and grb051022 is classified into the `` classical '' hard grb in the hete-2 sample @xcite .    in previous studies for grbs ,",
    "the absorption appeared only in a part of a prompt emission and/or afterglow @xcite .",
    "then we perform the time resolved spectral analyses for 10 time intervals to investigate a time variation of the absorption , and summarize the results in table [ spec_tb ] .",
    "the bottom three panels in figure [ lc_par ] show the time variation of these spectral parameters . in all time intervals ,",
    "we adopt the absorbed ple model because reliable @xmath51 can not be obtained from these fittings with grbm model .",
    "the quoted errors correspond to the 90 % confidence region for @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath52 , and the 68 % confidence region for @xmath43 and @xmath47 .    from the spectral variation , the initial pulse ( t @xmath36 21.0@xmath3036.7 s )",
    "is hard and accompanied by a soft pulse ( t @xmath36 36.7@xmath3057.7 s ) . during the later long phase ( t @xmath36 57.7@xmath30220 s )",
    ", the spectrum shows a softening trend .",
    "these are consistent with the general view of the time variation of grb spectra .",
    "the most remarkable result is that @xmath38 is significantly needed and seems constant in all the time intervals contrary to the results from the previous studies",
    ". then we perform spectral fitting by assuming the absorption fixed to the value obtained by the analysis of the average spectrum and get acceptable fits for all intervals ( see @xmath53 in table [ spec_tb ] ) . in conclusion , @xmath38 does not seem to have a significant evolution .",
    "using the measured redshift @xmath54 @xcite , the luminosity distance is given by @xmath55 cm ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 km s@xmath59 mpc@xmath59 ) .",
    "@xmath60 turns out to be @xmath61 ergs by integrating the best - fit time integrated spectrum in the observer frame over the energy ranging from @xmath62 kev to @xmath63 mev ( @xcite , ; @xcite ) .",
    "we also find the peak energy of @xmath64 spectrum in the source frame @xmath65 kev .",
    "these values are lying on @xmath66 relation @xcite .    in the standard view , the fireball is collimated @xcite and the collimation corrected energies are concentrated around @xmath67 ergs @xcite .",
    "this scenario is believed to appear as the achromatic break in observed afterglow light curve @xcite .",
    "the break time of the light curve @xmath68 days was reported using the x - ray afterglow observations @xcite .",
    "if this is due to the jet break , the jet opening angle @xmath69 @xcite turns out to be @xmath70 deg assuming @xmath71 @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is a proton number density around the grb site and @xmath75 is an energy conversion efficiency .",
    "then , we estimate the collimation corrected energy @xmath76 @xcite scaling @xmath60 by ( 1@xmath77 ) and find @xmath78 ergs .",
    "this value is lying on @xmath79 relation @xcite .",
    "thus the jet break at 2.9 days seems plausible .",
    "the follow - up observations of x - ray afterglow were performed by the swift xrt instrument from 16:35:54 on 22 october 2005 @xcite . using the three orbits of xrt data",
    ", we performed spectral analyses of the afterglow , and found @xmath80 @xmath2 and @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "these values are consistent with that previously reported by @xcite .",
    "we also found a constant absorption during the xrt observation .",
    "the absorption derived by the swift xrt observation is fully consistent with those obtained from the early hete-2 observation of the prompt emission . in earlier studies",
    ", it was reported that the absorption varied in time @xcite and therefore it was interpreted as an absorption by the circum - burst dusty medium in the very vicinity of internal shocks .",
    "in contrast , our analyses present the constant absorption throughout the prompt emission and the afterglow",
    ". it might be due to the intervening medium along the line of sight which is in the outside of external shocks ; i.e. a molecular cloud in the host galaxy .",
    "the large absorption would cause the extinctions of the afterglow emission .",
    "if the intervening medium is located somewhere in the middle between the source and our galaxy , the absorption should be at least @xmath38 @xmath83 @xmath39 @xmath2 .",
    "we find the visual extinction at minimum @xmath84 mag using the relationship @xmath85 @xmath86 found by @xcite .",
    "then we estimate the extinctions for other wavelengths at minimum using the extinction curves found by @xcite ; @xmath87 mag , @xmath88 mag , @xmath89 mag , @xmath90 mag , @xmath91 mag , @xmath92 mag , @xmath93 mag and @xmath94 mag .",
    "these large extinctions could explain the fact that no optical afterglow was found despite the prompt and deep search @xcite .",
    "the most extreme case is that the intervening medium is located in the very vicinity of the host galaxy of grb051022 .",
    "the absorption should be scaled by @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath1 @xmath2 and the extinctions are @xmath3 mag , @xmath96 mag , @xmath97 mag , @xmath98 mag , @xmath99 mag , @xmath100 mag , @xmath101 mag , @xmath102 mag and @xmath103 mag at maximum",
    ". if this is the case , no detection of any optical transient would be quite reasonable .",
    "considering that no optical afterglow is found despite a prompt deep search of afterglow down to @xmath104 mag @xcite , grb051022 is very similar to grb970828 which is one of the important grbs for which no optical afterglow was found despite a prompt deep search down to @xmath105 mag @xcite .",
    "@xcite reports that the radio afterglow of grb970828 is located between two bright sources ( a and b in figure 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "they suggest that there might be a dust lane intersecting a single galaxy or it might be a merging system of three components ( a , b and c in figure 3 of @xcite ) . the star formation rates ( sfr ) are reported by the authors as sfr@xmath1061.2 @xmath107 yr@xmath59 for component a and sfr@xmath1060.3 @xmath107 yr@xmath59 for b.    the absorption for grb970828 using the brightness of x - ray and radio afterglow was @xmath108 @xmath2 in the source frame , therefore a dusty molecular cloud is one possible interpretation @xcite .",
    "meantime @xcite shows a time - variable absorption with @xmath109 @xmath2 in the source frame based on the spectral analyses of the x - ray afterglow .",
    "therefore the most probable interpretation is that the absorption could be dominantly due to the medium near the grb site @xcite .    for grb051022 , several authors report , based on the optical and ir observations , the most probable candidate of its host galaxy @xcite at the location consistent with those of the burst ( sxc ) , the x - ray afterglow ( xrt ) , and the radio transient ( vla ) .",
    "from these images , the host galaxy ( i.e. , galaxy `` b '' in the above references ) seems roundly extended at least @xmath110 in radius , which corresponds to be about 7kpc at @xmath111 , greater than the typical size of a galactic bulge .",
    "therefore it would not be an `` edge - on '' spiral galaxy .",
    "there is also a report that this galaxy is blue with sfr of more than 20 @xmath107 yr@xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the value is far larger than that for grb970828 .",
    "this large sfr could be consistent with a dusty molecular cloud in the galaxy .",
    "in addition , grb051022 shows the constant absorption in the soft x - ray band throughout the prompt emission and the afterglow .",
    "this sharply contrasts with the previous results @xcite .",
    "the absorption for grb051022 is evaluated to be @xmath1 @xmath2 , which is larger than that of grb970828 .",
    "our results favor an interpretation that the absorbing medium is outside the external shock at @xmath112 cm and could be a dusty molecular cloud .",
    "we would like to thank the hete-2 members for their support .",
    "we acknowledge the use of public data from the swift data archive . the hete-2 mission is supported in the us by nasa contract nasw-4690 ; in japan in part by the ministry of education , culture , sports , science , and technology grant - in - aid 14079102 ; and in france by cnes contract 793 - 01 - 8479 .",
