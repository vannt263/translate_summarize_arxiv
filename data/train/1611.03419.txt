    "figure  [ fig : compare_columns]a gives the fraction of the cross section that forms an unbroken column for different structures , orientations and void fractions . to derive the cross section of unbroken columns , the three - dimensional distribution of solid fraction of the void material",
    "is projected in a direction parallel to the columns , yielding the two - dimensional distribution of material .",
    "this two - dimensional distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : compare_columns]c , d , f , g for bcc at different void fractions and different directions of projection . for interpretation",
    ", they can be thought of as idealised x - ray photographies of the structure .",
    "the share of the area that equals 1 in the two - dimensional distribution represents the cross sectional area of an unbroken column in the direction of projection . in case of a body centred cubic arrangement",
    "this cross - sectional area behaves similar to the young s modulus . for void fractions below @xmath129 the larger area",
    "is oriented in direction .",
    "above @xmath130 the orientation contains stronger columns .",
    "the value of @xmath130 coincides with the void fraction at which the elastic behaviour of bcc switches . at @xmath131",
    "the straight columns in direction completely disappear .",

    "white colour corresponds to values of 1 and marks unbroken columns . ]",
    "the extremal values of the poisson ratio and their dependence on the angle @xmath100 is shown in figure  [ fig : nu_max_min ] and  [ fig : nu_winkel_kombi ] , respectively .",
    "the latter is performed for a void fraction of @xmath134 and @xmath82 .",
    "the poisson ratio also shows a switching of behaviour at @xmath128 .",
    "again , bcc with high void fraction behaves qualitatively similar to sc , with high values of @xmath116 and low values of @xmath117 .",
    "again , this can be explained with the orientation of columns in the void material . for high void fraction , columns are oriented along the cubic axes ( similar to sc ) .",
    "stress along the cubic axes is supported by these columns , yielding low relaxation in the perpendicular direction .",
    "stress diagonal to the column direction , e.g. along the direction , is distributed to the and column , which causes folding of the structure in direction , as sketched in figure  [ fig : sc_kombi1]b .",
    "this results in high values of @xmath116 but even lower values of @xmath117 .",
    "bcc at low void fractions behaves completely different .",
    "the strongest columns are oriented in , , , and direction .",
    "stress along the direction , hence , is distributed on the columns in and .",
    "this causes a folding of the structure in direction , yielding high values of @xmath117 but low values of @xmath116 .      in order to compare fcc and hcp in a direct way ,",
    "the hexagonal orientation of fcc , here called fcch , is considered .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : rve ] , the rve of fcch is bounded by planes in ( 1 0 0 ) , ( 0 1 -1 ) and ( 1 1 1 ) orientation .",
    "the two void arrangements , fcch and hcp , have a very similar structure .",
    "the voids are placed in layers of hexagonal ordering .",
    "these layers are stacked in different sequences , shown in figure  [ fig : hcp_fcc_column ] .",
    "+ for both structures , the dependence of the young s modulus on the void fraction an on the direction is shown in figure  [ fig : e_max_min ] and figure  [ fig : e_winkel_kombi ] .",
    "the hcp arrangement shows a clear maximum in the direction .",
    "this effect is similar as observed with the simple cubic arrangement . in this direction ,",
    "the structure of the interstitial material contains a straight column , marked c in figure  [ fig : hcp_fcc_column]b , which supports the load very efficiently .",
    "hcp also contains broken side - columns a that contribute only slightly to the young s modulus in direction .",
    "+ fcch shows four maxima in the , , and direction , which is consistent with its cubic symmetry . in these directions ,",
    "the fcch structure contains columns that are broken in every third layer , marked b in figure  [ fig : hcp_fcc_column]a . as a result ,",
    "the maximal young s moduli for fcch are a bit smaller than the maximum for hcp . to support load along these broken columns , the load has to be transferred between the columns .",
    "this is done by shearing the material sheets between the columns . for higher void fraction ,",
    "the material sheets become very thin so that load transfer between the broken columns causes stronger shearing deformation . supporting the load along the unbroken column c of hcp",
    "does not rely on shearing of material sheets .",
    "therefore , the maximum young s modulus of fcch decreases faster than the maximum of hcp with increasing void fraction , as shown in figure  [ fig : e_max_min ] .",
    "+     fcch shows broken columns b while hcp shows unbroken columns c and broken side - columns a. ]        the young s modulus of hcp appears to be symmetric around the axis while for fcch it shows cubic symmetry .",
    "however , in the ( 0 0 0 1 ) and ( 1 1 1 ) plane , respectively , the young s moduli of hcp and fcc are isotropic ( figure  [ fig : e_winkel_kombi ] ) .",
    "the isotropy of fcch and hcp in the basal plane can be related to crystal symmetry as illustrated in figure  [ fig : symm ] .",
    "macroscopic properties such as elastic moduli must conform to the external symmetry of the crystal . in the case of hcp , this includes a six - fold rotation about the axis , perpendicular to the hexagonal layers . a well known theorem states that this is sufficient to ensure that the stiffness tensor ( which is fourth rank ) is transversely isotropic  @xcite , precisely the property exhibited in the calculations ( figure  [ fig : e_winkel_kombi ] ) . also equation  ( [ eq : cazzani ] ) derived by cazzani  @xcite reflects this isotropy , yielding a dependence of the young s modulus on @xmath135 .",
    "+ in the case of fcch , transverse isotropy is not observed , but at least young s modulus is isotropic for imposed strain in the ( 1 1 1 ) plane ( and also in the ( -1 1 1 ) , ( 1 -1 1 ) , and ( 1 1 -1 ) plane ) as observed in figure  [ fig : e_winkel_kombi ] . for fcc",
    "there is indeed no six - fold rotation included in its point group . instead , the axes , , and correspond to a three - fold symmetry around the axis . three - fold symmetry is not sufficient to ensure isotropy .",
    "including a reflection at the plane three - fold symmetry is transformed into six - fold symmetry .",
    "the reflection - based six - fold symmetry implies isotropy only if the direction of strain is not changed by the reflection .",
    "apart from the axis itself , the only directions for strain which are not altered by this reflection are those which lie in the reflection plane .",
    "hence , a limited isotropy holds for directions of strain within such a reflection plane only , as observed .",
    "+ figure  [ fig : hcp_fcch_iso ] shows the dependence of the young s modulus on the angle @xmath100 for @xmath136 .",
    "perfect isotropy is not reproduced by the numerical method .",
    "the fluctuations are below 0.2 % which is in line with the numerical uncertainty of the method .",
    "additionally , fcch and hcp exhibit different values for the young s modulus in the basal plane .",
    "this is surprising , since both structures consist of layers of hexagonally arranged voids .",
    "the difference in the young s modulus between fcch and hcp parallel to these layers equals about @xmath89 for increased numerical resolution @xmath137 .",
    "since the numerical uncertainty for the increased resolution was found to be smaller than @xmath80 , the difference in the young s modulus is definitely physical .",
    "the interstitial material of both void structures consist of the same type of hexagonal layers , but the way the layers are stacked and connected is different .",
    "this might cause a tiny difference in the transversal relaxation during deformation .    .",
    "with increasing numerical resolution @xmath64 the young s modulus becomes more isotropic .",
    "a small difference of 1 % remains even for very high resolution .",
    "note the small range of the vertical axis . ]",
    "+ the extremal values of the poisson ratio and its dependence on the angle @xmath100 are shown in figure  [ fig : nu_max_min ] and  [ fig : nu_winkel_kombi ] , respectively , for a void fraction of @xmath72 . the ( 0 0 0 1 ) and ( 1 1 1 ) planes are isotropic in terms of the poisson ratio .",
    "but there is a difference in the values between both structures , supporting the idea of a difference in the young s modulus between the ( 0 0 0 1 ) and ( 1 1 1 ) plane . for fcch",
    "the poisson ratio @xmath117 is higher than for hcp .",
    "this means , that under strain orthogonal to the direction fcch relaxes more along the direction than hcp along the direction .",
    "consequently , fcch is softer in the ( 1 1 1 ) plane than hcp in the ( 0 0 0 1 ) plane .",
    "still , both planes are isotropic in terms of the poisson ratio .",
    "we have recently published a more detailed study on the relations of the elastic parameters of hcp and fcc void material and their scaling behaviour  @xcite .      in case of random void arrangement",
    "the mean young s modulus , averaged over 45 different , randomly generated rves is shown in figure  [ fig : e_max_min ] for different void fractions .",
    "the mean young s modulus is relatively low , compared to periodic structures .",
    "the reason is that in random packing column - like structures do not exist .",
    "maximum and minimum young s modulus for a given void fraction are derived by calculating the extremal values of each rve separately and averaging them over all 45 corresponding rves .",
    "note , that the extremal values depend on the numbers of voids within an rve . a higher number of voids causes an averaging effect , yielding less prominent extremal values . for an infinite number of voids random",
    "packing is isotropic .",
    "however , the extremal values give an estimation of the local variation of the mechanical properties in random packing . as an example",
    ", figure  [ fig : e_winkel_kombi ] shows the dependence of the young s modulus on the direction at @xmath138 for one arbitrarily selected rve . even though only 30 voids are considered , the variations are small , below @xmath139 , and no distinct anisotropy is evident . the poisson ratio of random void packing is shown in figure  [ fig : nu_max_min ] . since random packing should be isotropic in the limit of an infinite sample , the definition of the orthonormal basis @xmath109 is arbitrary .",
    "however , for comparison with the other structures the same algorithm is used .",
    "again , the variation of @xmath140 is a measure for the local anisotropy of random packing .",
    "it is below @xmath139 in the present case .",
    "+ computation of overlapping voids was not possible for random packing with the present method , because one has to define the boundaries of the rve with sufficient distance to the void surfaces to create a suitable fe mesh .",
    "with increasing void diameter , possible positions for these boundaries become less available .",
    "the research question at the start of this investigation was whether a particular arrangement of spherical voids in a regular lattice would yield more advantageous properties than others , so that the fabrication process should target such an arrangement .",
    "having achieved a level of uncertainty of 0.2 % , the present study provides very sound data for the linear elastic properties of a number of such void materials .",
    "these are reported and a detailed comparison is undertaken .",
    "the result is that for given solid fraction , the variation of direction - averaged values among the structures is small . in this situation",
    "one may seek to extract useful structure - independent rules .",
    "for example , this study gives a fitting curve for the mean young s modulus , averaged over all directions , that represents quite well a wide range of void fractions and different void arrangements .",
    "+ the present study is confined to linear elasticity , but extension to non - linear behaviour of the interstitial material will be interesting to investigate .",
    "non - linear behaviour is expected to be much more sensitive to the void organisation , resulting , e.g. , from buckling phenomena  @xcite .",
    "another important aspect is the growth and coalescence of voids , leading to material failure  @xcite which might also be sensitive to the void organization . +",
    "the dominant structural feature of these void materials consists of the necks confined between three or four voids , which narrow to zero thickness as rigidity - loss is approached .",
    "these necks or columns have been used throughout this study to explain elastic behaviour of different void materials . in an associated study  @xcite a beam model",
    "is proposed which takes into account the topology of the network of necks in hcp and fcc void material and derives a scaling theory for the elastic behaviour close to rigidity - loss .",
    "the simple beam model shows very good agreement with the detailed fe simulation in the present paper .",
    "a notable feature of the present results is the occurrence of poisson ratios that lie outside the well known bonds for isotropic materials .",
    "this is also reproduced and well explained with the beam model .",
    "+ the present study is motivated by the elastic properties of solid foams . in case of monodisperse bubbles",
    "shaped boundaries  @xcite or electromagnetic fields  @xcite could create regularly arranged bubble crystals .",
    "however , the investigated geometries differ substantially from solid foam . close to a gas fraction corresponding to touching bubbles",
    "the bubbles would remain approximately spherical , justifying the approach of spherical voids . with increasing gas fraction , bubbles in a foam deform . seeking a state of minimum surface energy they form thin",
    ", flat lamellas between neighbouring bubbles and elongated plateau borders confined between three bubbles .",
    "these plateau borders correspond to the necks or columns , mentioned above , but show a substantially different geometry  @xcite .",
    "this presumably yields a different elastic behaviour which is less sensitive to the solid fraction .",
    "gibson and ashby  @xcite modelled an open - cell foam structure to consist of a network of straight beams with no necks but constant beam thickness .",
    "they found the young s modulus to scale with the square of the void fraction while necks give a scaling to the power of 3.5 , as shown in our other study  @xcite .",
    "the realistic scaling presumably lies somewhere between these extreme approximations . + for computations of more realistic foams at very high gas fractions , one could use the surface evolver  @xcite to find realistic geometries .",
    "subsequently , one may apply fe simulations similar to the present work , in order to extract the elastic behaviour of these foams .",
    "however , it is expected that the qualitative behaviour is similar . for these extensions",
    "the present study provides valuable reference data which clarify the physical properties and may also serve as validation data for further assessments .",
