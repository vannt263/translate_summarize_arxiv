    "the nature of dark matter is one of the fundamental problems of physics and cosmology . weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , i.e.  particles with weakly interacting cross sections and masses in the gev10  tev range , are among the best motivated candidates for dark matter .",
    "of particular interest is a low mass region , @xmath1 gev , suggested by data from three direct dark matter experiments : dama  @xcite , cogent  @xcite and cresst - ii   @xcite .",
    "dama and cogent report annual modulations with the expected characteristics of a wimp signal  @xcite .",
    "cresst - ii observes an excess of events above their known background , excess which may be interpreted as due to dark matter wimps .",
    "stringent upper limits have been placed on dark matter wimps by other direct detection experiments .",
    "the most stringent limits in the region of @xmath1  gev wimps come from the xenon10  @xcite , xenon100  @xcite , simple  @xcite , and cdms experiments  @xcite .",
    "all but one of these limits result from an upper bound on the total unmodulated event rate .",
    "the exception is a recent result by the cdms collaboration  @xcite , which has searched for an annual modulation in their data and , not finding it , has placed a stringent upper limit on its amplitude .",
    "here we compare the above measurements and upper limits in a halo - model independent fashion .",
    "we concentrate on light wimps with spin independent ( si ) interactions , and extend the halo - independent method of fox , liu , and weiner @xcite , later extensively employed in  @xcite , by including energy resolution , efficiency , and form factors with arbitrary energy dependence .",
    "the use of constant efficiencies and form factors over bins constituted a limitation of earlier versions of the method . in our form",
    ", the method can be used by any experiment to present their own results in a way that would allow for an immediate comparison between experiments in a halo - independent manner .",
    "fox , liu , and weiner @xcite presented their method for differential and total rates .",
    "statistical analyses usually use rates integrated over energy intervals , e.g. when computing maximum gap limits .",
    "when integrating the differential rates over energy bins , the energy dependence of efficiencies and form factors within each bin must be taken into account .",
    "fox , liu , and weiner  @xcite took efficiencies and form factors constant over the bin . for binned rates",
    ", they evaluated them at the central energy of each bin .",
    "for the total rate , they evaluated them at the energies that minimize or maximize the ratio of the rates to be compared , depending on whether one is considering a putative signal or a constraint .",
    "they also included the energy resolution of dama by smearing with a gaussian distribution but the details of this procedure are not spelled out in their paper . having to use constant efficiencies and form factors lead frandsen et al .",
    "@xcite to assume that each bin is sufficiently small so that these quantities do not vary significantly within a single bin .",
    "this is a particularly limiting restriction in analyzing the cresst ii data due to the onset of detector module thresholds .",
    "our method overcomes all of these limitations .",

    "isospin - violating couplings @xmath28 have been considered as a possibility to weaken the upper bounds obtained with heavier target elements , which being richer in neutrons than lighter elements , have their couplings to wimps suppressed for @xmath29@xcite .",

    "this was done extensively in  @xcite , separately for @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "since the @xmath7-@xmath31 relation depends explicitly on the wimp mass @xmath2 , this procedure can be carried out only by fixing @xmath2 ( except when @xmath2 is much smaller than the masses of all nuclei involved , in which case the combination @xmath35 becomes independent of @xmath2 ) .",
    "however most experiments do not measure the recoil energy @xmath7 directly , but rather a detected energy @xmath36 subject to measurement uncertainties and fluctuations .",

    "<S> we extend the halo - independent method of fox , liu , and weiner to include energy resolution and efficiency with arbitrary energy dependence , making it more suitable for experiments to use in presenting their results . </S>",
    "<S> then we compare measurements and upper limits on the direct detection of low mass ( @xmath0 gev ) weakly interacting massive particles with spin - independent interactions , including the upper limit on the annual modulation amplitude from the cdms collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> we find that isospin - symmetric couplings are severely constrained both by xenon100 and cdms bounds , and that isospin - violating couplings are still possible at the lowest energies , while the tension of the higher energy cogent bins with the cdms modulation constraint remains . </S>",
    "<S> we find the cresst ii signal is not compatible with the modulation signals of dama and cogent . </S>"
