    "the possibility to interpret dark energy in terms of an ultra - light pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson field is at the center of an exciting debate stretching over the last decade , see e.g. frieman1995,kim2002,wilczek2004,hall2005,kaloper2005,barbieri:2005gj .",

    "the present paper is the very first stage in a long - term program exploring the implications of su(2)@xmath29u(1)@xmath27 , see also @xcite .",
    "the authors are well aware of the fact that this program may lead to the falsification of the postulate su(2)@xmath29u(1)@xmath27 .",
    "mounting evidence for its correctness is , however , provided by two - loop calculations of thermodynamical quantities in the deconfining phase of su(2 ) yang - mills theory , see @xcite , making a further pursuit of this program worthwhile .",
    "for the reader s convenience , let us put the results of ref.hofmann2005 into perspective with other approaches to yang - mills thermodynamics .",
    "first of all , it is important to note that ref .",
    "@xcite considers the case of pure thermodynamics only , that is , the absence of external ( static or dynamic ) sources which would upset the spatial homogeneity of the system . as a consequence",
    ", the approach in hofmann2005 has nothing to say about the spatial string tension in the deconfining phase .",
    "the spatial string tension , introducing a distance scale @xmath34 into the system , can , however , be easily extracted in lattice simulations of the spatial wilson loop @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that static sources can be treated adiabatically based on the approach of @xcite by assuming a position dependence of temperature , but this is the subject of future research . in the absence of sources ,",
    "a situation that is of relevance for physics on cosmological length scales , refs.@xcite give a detailed and reliable account of su(2 ) and su(3 ) yang - mills thermodynamics .",
    "lattice simulations for su(3 ) , using the differential method brown1988,deng1988 , which is adopted to finite lattice sizes , yield quantitative agreement with the result for the entropy density ( an infrared safe quantity ) obtained in ref.@xcite . the results for the pressure and the energy density ( infrared sensitive ) agree qualitatively with those obtained in @xcite .",
    "that is , in contrast to the integral method , which assumes the infinite - volume limit on a finite - size lattice , the pressure is negative shortly above the critical temperature in the deconfining phase , and there is a power - like fast approach to the stefan - boltzmann limit for @xmath35 .",
    "both phenomena are observed in the approach of @xcite , but numerically the results differ in the vicinity of the phase boundary - function would be the cause of the _ apparent _ problems with the differential method . ] . by virtue of the trace",
    "anomaly the gluon condensate , up to a factor weakly depending on temperature ( @xmath36-function over fundamental coupling @xmath37 ) , coincides with the trace of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath38 . neglecting the masses and interactions of the excitations , which is an excellent approximation at high temperatures as far as the excitation s equation of state",
    "is concerned , we have @xmath39 . in @xcite the temperature dependence of the su(2 ) gluon condensate was investigated on the lattice , and , indeed a linear rise of the gluon condensate with temperature was observed .",
    "notice the conceptual and technical differences of @xcite to the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) approach @xcite .",
    "the latter derives a nonlocal theory for interacting soft and ultrasoft modes .",
    "while the htl approach , in a highly impressive way technically , integrates perturbative ultraviolet fluctuations into effective vertices it can not shed light on the stabilization of the infrared physics associated with nonperturbative fluctuations residing in the magnetic sector of the theory .",
    "the derivation of the phase @xmath40 in @xcite , however , invokes these nonperturbative , magnetic correlations .",
    "an impressive machinery has been developed within the renormalization - group flow approach to yang - mills thermodynamics both in the imaginary @xcite and the real - time approach @xcite the latter making important observations concerning the ( nonperturbative ) temperature dependence of the thermal gluon mass .",
    "interesting results for the nonperturbative temperature dependence of the fundamental gauge coupling in quantum chromodynamics were obtained in @xcite . however , to the best of the authors knowledge , no decisive nonperturbative calculation ( fully considering the magnetic sector ) of the thermodynamical pressure or related quantities has yet been performed within this approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , we briefly recall some basic nonperturbative results obtained in @xcite for su(2 ) yang - mills thermodynamics .",
    "then we discuss the viability of our scenario when confronting it with particle - physics experiments and cosmological observations .",
    "subsequently , we consider for a spatially flat universe the evolution of the cosmological scale factor @xmath41 and of the axion - field @xmath42 from the time of decoupling @xmath43 ( corresponding to @xmath44 ) up to the present .",
    "we then investigate the future evolution of the universe up to the point when the transition between the deconfining and the preconfining phase of su(2)@xmath28 will take place and the photon will acquire a meissner mass .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions and an outlook on future research .",
    "in @xcite a nonperturbative approach for su(2)/su(3 ) yang - mills thermodynamics is developed . for the sake of brevity we recall only some of the results relevant for the present study .",
    "analytical expressions are reported in the appendix .    _ deconfining ( electric ) phase : _    at high @xmath45 it is shown in @xcite that an inert adjoint higgs field @xmath46 emerges upon spatial coarse - graining over topological defects .",
    "the modulus of the higgs field is ( nonperturbatively ) temperature dependent with @xmath47 ( here @xmath48 denotes the yang - mills scale as defined in the deconfining phase hofmann2005 ) ; furthermore , the field @xmath49 induces a dynamical gauge symmetry breaking su(2)@xmath50 u(1 ) : two of the three gauge bosons become massive ( denoted by @xmath51 ) , while the third one remains massless ( denoted by @xmath52 ) .",

    "for @xmath58 the @xmath51 bosons acquire an infinite mass , @xmath59 .",
    "thus they do no longer ( weakly ) screen the propagation of the massless excitation @xmath52 .",
    "plots for the energy - density and for the pressure as functions of the dimensionless temperature @xmath60 are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .    in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "a jump in the energy density at the critical value @xmath61 is seen .",
