    "the electronic structure of few layer graphene@xcite systems consists of pairs of bands which cross , or narrowly avoid crossing , near the fermi level .",
    "because the number of band pairs depends in an interesting way on the stacking arrangement , and because both semi - metallic and semi - conducting behaviors occur , this family of two - dimensional materials provides an attractive playground for the study of electron interaction effects in systems@xcite with approximate fermi points .",
    "for example , interactions lead to a marginal fermi liquid behavior in neutral single layer graphene,@xcite and to broken - symmetry ordered states in bilayers .",
    "@xcite    the recent surge of interest in abc stacked trilayer graphene @xcite motivates theoretical studies of the electron interaction induced instabilities that are expected when these structures are weakly disordered .",
    "instabilities are favored in abc trilayers by extremely flat crossing@xcite of a single - pair of bands at the neutral system fermi level , and by exchange energy frustration associated with mometum - space textures in the valence band wavefunctions.@xcite in the trilayer case the competition between competing broken symmetry states is massaged by weak remote neighbor hopping processes that reshape the bands at energies within @xmath1 mev of the crossing point .",
    "@xcite this energy scale should be compared to the @xmath2 mev scale of analogous processes in bilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "the remote hopping processes are therefore more likely to play a prominent role in determining how the system responds to electron - electron interactions in the trilayer case .",
    "the broken symmetry states that have been discussed in the bilayer graphene literature can broadly be classified either as gapped phases with broken layer inversion symmetry , @xcite or as gapless nematic states that lower rotational symmetry .",
    "@xcite although the two types of states in principle should have clear experimental signatures , it has not yet been possible@xcite to achieve a universally accepted consensus on the character of the ground state because of the complicating role of residual disorder . studies of abc stacked trilayer graphene could prove to be more unambiguous because its bands are flatter and interaction effects correspondingly stronger , while disorder strengths should be comparable .",
    "in this paper we present a study of the competition between gapful and gapless states in abc stacked trilayer graphene , including the effects of weak remote - hopping processes which can dominate band dispersion very close to the band - crossing ( dirac ) point .",
    "our study is based on a six - band @xmath0-orbital tight - binding model , combined with long - range coulomb interactions treated using a hartree - fock mean - field - theory .",
    "the quasiparticle band - structures of both gapped and gapless states are reshaped when interactions are included .",
    "we find that gapped phases are favored over a wide range of the hopping - parameter model space . in mean - field theory",
    "the energy difference between gapped and gapless states is typically smaller than @xmath3 ev per carbon atom .",
    "the small condensation energy reflects the fact that only single - electron states close to the band crossing points participate in ordering .",
    "the strength of the direct hopping process between low - energy sites on the outer layers of the trilayer , @xmath4 , plays an especially important role in determining the character of the ground state .",
    "we describe abc trilayer graphene using a lattice model hamiltonian with one atomic @xmath5 orbital per carbon site .",
    "we label the six sublattice sites illustrated in fig .",
    "1(a ) _ a _ , _ b _ , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ; the @xmath10 and @xmath9 sites avoid near - neighbor inter - layer coupling and for this reason are _ low - energy sites _ which are dominantly occupied by electrons close to the band crossing points . with this convention ,",
    "the six band tight - binding model hamiltonian of abc trilayer graphene is : @xmath11 where @xmath12 with @xmath13 using the same triangular lattice vector convention as in ref .",
    "the global minus sign in front of the hamiltonian means that @xmath0-bonding bands have lower energy than anti - bonding bands when the @xmath14 parameters are positive . in most of our calculations",
    "we have used graphite hopping parameter values which are similar to those in ref .",
    "[ ] : @xmath15 ev , @xmath16 ev , @xmath17 ev , @xmath18 ev .",
    "we specifically address the importance of the signs of the remote @xmath4 and @xmath19 hopping parameters .",
    "the near - neighbor intralayer and interlayer hopping processes @xmath20 and @xmath21 are responsible for broad features of the band structure , while the @xmath4 and @xmath19 parameters have their main impact close to the band - crossing points .",
    "this model qualitatively reproduces the _ ab initio _ band structure in ref .",
    "[ ] , in particular capturing the orientation of the triangle formed by the three band - crossing points close to the brillouin - zone corner .",
    "we have ignored the abc trilayer @xmath22 and @xmath23 processes that break particle - hole symmetry , and other small onsite terms that are often introduced in models of graphite , because they do not visibly alter the low energy features of the bands in abc trilayer graphene .    using a model similar to",
    "that used previously for bilayer graphene,@xcite .",
    "we have also examined the influence of a term in the hamiltonian that is intended to capture the influence on low - energy states of an interlayer relative - translation strain .",
    "we write @xmath24 , introducing a damping factor which makes the term small away from the brillouin - zone corners , where this form for the strain hamiltonian becomes inaccurate , by setting @xmath25 .    because there is some confusion in the literature on the signs of the remote hopping processes ,",
    "we have also considered other sign choices for @xmath4 and @xmath19 . as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) direct hopping @xmath4 between the low energy sites @xmath10 , @xmath26 gives rise to three fermi points at the vertices of a triangle centered on the brillouin - zone corner .",
    "the trigonal warping ( @xmath19 ) process which connect the @xmath10 , @xmath7 and @xmath27 , @xmath9 sites is also responsible for a trigonal distortion that leads to four fermi points near k , as in bilayer graphene .",
    "each one of the three fermi points contribute to a phase winding of @xmath28 for a total @xmath29 phase winding along paths that encircle all three points , as expected in abc trilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "( we use the term fermi point to refer to a band crossing that is tied to the fermi level of a neutral abc trilayer . the band crossing points are exactly at the fermi level because we have neglected particle - hole symmetry breaking terms in the band structure model . )",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath19 terms break circular symmetry near the dirac point by splitting a single fermi point with cubic band dispersion into multiple fermi points with linear dispersion .",
    "the orientations of the triangular distortion due to @xmath4 and @xmath19 are opposite when both hopping parameters have the same sign .",
    "first principles band structure calculations suggest that @xmath4 dominates over @xmath19 and determines the shape of the bands near the dirac point .",
    "( note that @xmath4 has a much greater influence on the two low - energy states than @xmath19 for a given numerical value because it couples them directly , whereas @xmath19 acts virtually via high - energy states . ) when both terms are present simultaneously and have the same sign the band structure can have a a hybrid shape ; for some parameters values the bands consist of two intertwined triangles with opposite orientations that can exhibit up to nine dirac cones .",
    "the additional parameter , @xmath30 couples @xmath10 , @xmath7 and @xmath6 , @xmath9 , like the @xmath19 term , but without an accompanying factor @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath30 term qualitatively describes a band deformation that lower the crystal rotational symmetry , and is similar to the model used to mimic a small layer - sliding structural deformation in bilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "this term is also useful to seed lowered rotational symmetry gapless states in our hartree - fock calculations .",
    "electron - electron interaction effects are treated in an unrestricted hartree - fock approximation @xcite which allows symmetries to be broken : @xmath32 c^{\\dag}_{{\\bf k } \\lambda } c_{{\\bf k } \\lambda }    \\nonumber   \\\\",

    "we used an effective dielectric constant @xmath48 in our calculations , partly to account for dielectric screening by surrounding material and partly to account for the well known tendency of hartree - fock approximation , which neglects screening , to overestimate exchange interaction effects.@xcite the present implementation of the lattice model hartree - fock mean - field theory follows closely the method described in refs .",
    "[ ] for single and bilayer graphene which also used a momentum space representation of the coulomb interaction .",
    "one difference in the present implementation is that we sample the full brillouin zone without taking advantage of the symmetry of the crystal in order to allow for the possibility of broken rotational symmetry nematic phases . because of the greater importance of states near the dirac point we have sampled momentum space non - uniformly ; for k - points closer than @xmath49 to the dirac point ( where @xmath13 is the triangular lattice constant of graphene ) we have used a sampling density corresponding to 2304 @xmath50 2304 points in the entire brillouin zone . outside this region",
    "we used a matched but coarser sampling with density corresponding to 18 @xmath50 18 points in the brillouin zone . for a given sampling density , the hartree - fock equations are solved iteratively and converged to @xmath51 ev per carbon atom in total energy .     term",
    "note that the gapless solutions restore the rotational symmetry of the crystal lattice that was broken by the @xmath30 term , indicating that nematic order is not stable at the mean - field level in the trilayer case .",

    "intervalley exchange , normally neglected in continuum models , makes a substantial contribution to the energy difference between laf and anomalous hall states . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the remote hopping terms introduce a triangular distortion in the shape of the bands near the fermi energy , but do not greatly influence gapped state properties .",
    "these distortions will have important consequences for the electronic properties of doped abc trilayers .",
    "it is noteworthy that the gapless phase within the minimal model develops a three fermi point structure due to electron interactions alone , although it does not lower rotational symmetry .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath64 terms also plays a role in determining the orientation of the triangular deformation the bands undergo near the dirac points in the gapless state .    motivated by uncertainty in the values of the remote hopping process parameters",
    ", we have performed self - consistent calculations over a range of values of the @xmath4 , @xmath19 and @xmath30 parameters .",
    "the dependence of the energy difference between the interaction driven gapped and gapless states on model parameters is summarized in fig .",
    "we find that the gapped phase almost always has a lower total energy than the gapless phase .",
    "however , as expected , when the remote hopping processes are stronger , the difference in the total energy between the gapped and gapless phases become smaller .",
    "3 shows that the occurrence of the gapped phase relies on the principal intra and interlayer processes whose strength is defined by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and by the flatness of the crossing between conduction and valence bands that their dominance implies .",
    "we have used hartree - fock mean - field - theory calculation to demonstrate that electron interactions can lead to ordered phases in abc trilayer graphene , provided that the strengths of remote hopping process in this two - dimensional crystal are close to current estimates . in abc trilayers , bands near the dirac point",
    "are strongly influenced by the @xmath4 parameter over energy scales of @xmath1 mev , compared to the @xmath2 mev scale over which analogous processes play a role in ab bilayers .",
    "the physics of their interplay with interactions is therefore less likely to be distorted by disorder .",
    "remote hopping processes in abc trilayers can be important in fixing the shape of the energy bands near the fermi level .",
    "we have shown that the gapped broken symmetry phases are nevertheless preferred energetically over gapless states for a wide range of remote hopping parameters .",
    "we find that our gapless solutions do not lower the crystal symmetry , although they do generally lead to the formation of a triple dirac point at the vertices of an equilateral triangle .",
    "the nematic phase that would break the triangular crystal symmetry is not stable .",
    "when remote hopping processes are included the location of the dirac points is fixed by the @xmath4 process .",
    "there are three distinct gapped states which have very similar energies . among these the anomalous hall and spin hall ( ah and sh ) states",
    "have the same energy within mean - field theory , whereas the layer antiferromagnet state is distinct and is favored by inter - valley exchange because electrons with the same spin state have the same sense of layer polarization .",
    "we find that the difference in total energy between laf and ah / sh is two orders of magnitude smaller than the condensation energy of either state .",
    "these states should therefore , in our view , be considered as close cousins .",
    "it seems likely that real samples are likely to be found in configurations in which several phases are present separated by domain walls .",
    "an external magnetic field which favors anomalous hall states , at least at finite carrier densities , likely can be used to manipulate the domain structure .    using the hartree - fock approximation and reducing interaction strengths by a factor of @xmath65",
    ", we find that abc trilayer graphene has a substantial interaction driven gap of the order of @xmath66 mev .",
    "the size of the gap is sensitive to the choice we have made for the @xmath67 parameter , which we have chosen to mimic exchange interaction renormalization parameters that are used in _ ab initio _ hybrid - density - functional calculations .",
    "band structure effects can reduce the size of the gap , substantially so when @xmath4 is assigned a negative value . for favorable parameters the gaps we find are approximately twice as large as than those predicted values for bilayer graphene using corresponding approximations .",
    "the theoretical gaps are therefore very much larger than initial estimates of a spontaneous band gap from abc trilayer experiments which suggest a value @xmath68 mev .",
    "@xcite the discrepancy is certainly due in part to disorder and inhomogeneity which reduces the gaps of experimental systems below ideal values , but could also reflect a theoretical overestimate .",
    "we note in this connection that abc trilayer graphene samples generally have poorer quality than bilayers",
    ". this difference could be due to lower effectiveness of the current annealing procedure routinely applied to suspended graphene single or multilayer samples .",
    "future experimental work may establish a higher lower bound for the trilayer graphene gap .",
