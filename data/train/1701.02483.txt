    "in this paper , we propose sampling methods for fixed and random sample sizes .",
    "we will more particularly focus on the spacings that are the difference of population ranks between two successive selected units .",
    "we propose a large set of new methods that allows to control the spacings and thus the joint inclusion probabilities of population units in the sample .",
    "these methods are useful in that they allow to make less ( or more ) likely the selection of neighboring units . indeed , when the variable of interest takes similar values on neighboring units , spreading the sample improves estimations because the selection of similar units , that do not bring a lot of new information , is avoided .",
    "a sampling design is a probability distribution on all the finite subsets of a population .",
    "it can be implemented by means of sampling algorithms .",
    "several very different sampling algorithms can implement the same sampling designs .",
    "examples are given in @xcite where a large number of algorithms is given for designs like simple random sampling ( srs ) with and without replacement or maximum entropy sampling designs .",
    "algorithms such that the decision of selecting or not a unit into the sample is taken for each population unit successively according to the order of the population sampling frame are called `` sequential '' or `` one - pass '' algorithms",
    ". these algorithms are particularly useful when the population list is dynamic , like on a production chain or in real time sampling applications .",
    "systematic sampling is one of the most usual sampling designs .",
    "it has been studied among others by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "one advantage of systematic sampling is that it spreads the sample very well over the population , thus allowing to get precise estimators for totals and averages in the case of `` auto - correlated '' interest variables .",
    "indeed , it can be shown to be an optimal design in this case under some conditions @xcite",
    ". however , it presents the important drawback that lots of units couples have null joint inclusion probabilities .",
    "this makes impossible an unbiased estimation of the estimators variance .",
    "this drawback has led to a quest for other sampling designs that would not share it while retaining good estimation properties .",
    "@xcite proposed the deville - systematic method , also called ordered pivotal method by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite proposed a moving stratification algorithm that avoids the selection of neighboring units . @xcite and",
    "@xcite also proposed a method that allows to control joint - inclusion probabilities .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed to use determinantal point processes that are known for their repulsiveness property ( see for example * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this last method however requires to work with a huge matrix .",
    "we advocate the use of point processes with simple specifications , motivated by usual sampling designs : the systematic design has deterministic spacings between selected units , the bernoulli sampling design ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has geometrically distributed spacings , and circular spacings of the simple random sampling design follow a negative hypergeometric distribution ( see * ? ? ?",
