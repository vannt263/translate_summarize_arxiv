    "the chemical potential represents an important thermodynamic information for any system , in particular for liquids , where the possibility of combining different substances for forming optimal mixtures is strictly related to knowledge of the chemical potential of each component in the mixture environment . in this perspective",
    ", molecular simulation represents a powerful tool for predicting the chemical potential of complex molecular systems .",
    "popular , well established methodologies in molecular dynamics ( md ) are widom particle insertion ( ipm ) @xcite and thermodynamic integration ( ti ) @xcite .",
    "ipm is computationally very demanding often beyond a reasonable limit even in presence of large computational resources , but upon convergence , is rather accurate .",
    "ti is computationally convenient but specifically designed to calculate the chemical potential and thus it may not be optimal for employing md for studying other properties .",
    "in fact ti requires artificial modification of the atomistic interactions ( see appendix ) .",
    "recently we have suggested that the chemical potential could be calculated by employing the adaptive resolution simulation method in its grand canonical - like formulation ( gc - adress ) @xcite .",
    "adress was originally designed to interface regions of space at different levels of molecular resolution within one simulation set up .",
    "this allows for large and efficient multiscale simulations where the high resolution region is restricted to a small portion of space and the rest of the system is at coarser level .",
    "the recent version of the method , gc - adress , given its theoretical framework , should automatically calculate the chemical potential during the process of initial equilibration : in this work we prove that this is indeed the case and report results for the chemical potential for various liquids and mixtures of particular relevance in ( bio)-chemistry and material science .",
    "we compare our results with those from full atomistic ti and find a satisfactory agreement .",
    "this agreement allows us to conclude that every time a multiscale gc - adress is performed , @xmath0 is automatically calculated for each liquid component and implicitly confirm that the basic thermodynamics of the system is well described by the method .",
    "moreover , in recent work adress has been merged with the martini force field @xcite . in this context",
    ", the possibility of checking the consistency of a quantity like the chemical potential can be used as a further argument for the validity of the method in applications to large systems of biological interest .",
    "below we provide the basic technical ingredients of gc - adress which are relevant for the calculation of the chemical potential , more specific details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the original idea of adress is based on a simple intuitive physical principle :    * divide the space in three regions , one with atomistic resolution ( at ) and one with coarse - grained ( spherical ) resolution ( cg ) interfaced by a smaller region with an hybrid treatment , which is usually called transition region or hybrid region . *",
    "couple the molecules in the different regions through a spatial interpolation formula on the forces : @xmath1{{\\textbf{\\textit{f}}}}^{{{\\textrm{cg}}}}_{i , j }   \\label{eqforce}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 indicates two molecules , @xmath4 is the force derived from the atomistic force field and @xmath5 from the corresponding coarse - grained potential , @xmath6 is the center of mass ( com ) position of the molecule and @xmath7 is an interpolating function which smoothly goes from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ( or vice versa ) in the transition region ( @xmath10 ) where the lower resolution is then slowly transformed ( according to @xmath7 ) in the high resolution ( or vice versa ) , as illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "* in the transition region a thermodynamic force acting on the com of each molecule and a locally acting thermostat are added to assure the overall thermodynamic equilibrium at a given temperature .",
    "the thermodynamic force is defined in such a way that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the target pressure of the atomistic system ( region ) , @xmath13 is the pressure of the coarse - grained model , @xmath14 is the target molecular density of the atomistic system ( region )  @xcite .",
    "an additional locally acting thermostat is added to take care of the loss / gain of energy in the transition region .    , where the switching function @xmath15 ( in green ) is defined , and the region on the left , is the high resolution region ( atomistic ) . it must be noticed that differently from the original adress , in gc - adress the range of definition of @xmath15 is extended of an amount of @xmath16 .",
    "the extension of this additional region is equal to the cut - off radius of the atomistic interactions and @xmath15 takes the constant value of @xmath9 .",
    "the consequence is that molecules in the atomistic region interact with the rest of the system always and only via well defined atomistic interactions .",
    "this characteristic , in turn , allows to write an exact hamiltonian for the atomistic region and thus treat the system in a grand - canonical fashion ( see eq.12 of ref.@xcite),scaledwidth=47.5% ]    .",
    "[ fig1 ]    in @xcite we have defined necessary conditions in @xmath10 such that the spatial probability distribution of the full - atomistic reference system was reproduced up to a certain ( desired ) order in the atomistic region of the adaptive system .",
    "we have defined the @xmath17th order of a spatial ( configurational ) probability distribution of @xmath18 molecules , @xmath19 , as : @xmath20 the first order , often mentioned in this work , corresponds to the molecular number density @xmath21 .",
    "moreover we have shown that , because of the necessary conditions , the accuracy in the atomistic region is independent of the accuracy of the coarse - grained model , thus , in the coarse - grained region , one can use a generic liquid of spheres",
    "whose only requirement is that it has the same molecular density of the reference system . in the simulation set up ,",
    "@xmath22 is calculated via an iterative procedure using the molecular number density in @xmath10 .",
    "the iterative scheme consists of calculating @xmath23 ( @xmath24 the isothermal compressibility ) , and the thermodynamic force is considered converged when the target density @xmath14 is reached in @xmath10 . as a result",
    ", @xmath25 , acting in @xmath10 , assures that there are no artificial density variations across the system , thus it allows to accurately reproduce the first order of the probability distribution in the atomistic region .",
    "higher orders can be systematically achieved by imposing in @xmath10 a corrective force .",
    "for example , the com - com radial distribution function correction for the second order  @xcite .",
    "next it was proved that indeed the target grand canonical distribution , that is the probability distribution of a subsystem ( of the size of the atomistic region in gc - adress ) in a large full atomistic simulation is accurately reproduced .",
    "a large number of tests were performed and the reproduction by gc - adress of the probability distribution was numerically proved up to ( at least ) the third order , more than sufficient in md simulations . within this framework",
    "it was finally shown that the sum of work of @xmath25 and that of the thermostat corresponds to the difference in chemical potential between the atomistic and coarse - grained resolution ; this subject is treated in the next section .",
    "in ref .  @xcite it has been shown that the chemical potential of the atomistic and coarse - grained resolution are related by the following formula : @xmath26 with @xmath27 the chemical potential of the coarse - grained system ( in gc - adress this corresponds to a liquid of generic spheres ) , @xmath28 the chemical potential of the atomistic system , @xmath29 the work of the thermodynamic force in the transition region , @xmath30 the work / heat provided by the thermostat in order to slowly equilibrate the inserted / removed degrees of freedom in the transition region .",
    "@xmath30 is composed by two parts , one , called @xmath31 , which compensates the dissipation of energy due to the non - conservative interactions in @xmath10 , and another , @xmath32 , which is related to the equilibration of the reinserted / removed degrees of freedom ( rotational and vibrational ) . while the determination of @xmath32 is not required for our final aim ( that is the calculation of the excess chemical potential , as explained later on ) , the calculation of @xmath31 is very relevant .",
    "however this calculation is not straightforward and we have proposed to introduce an auxiliary hamiltonian approach where the coarse - grained and atomistic potential are interpolated , and not the forces as in the original adress .",
    "next , we impose that the hamiltonian system must have the same thermodynamic equilibrium of the original force - based gc - adress system ; this is done by introducing a thermodynamic force in the auxiliary hamiltonian approach , which , at the target temperature , keeps the density of particles across the system as in gc - adress . in the auxiliary hamiltonian approach",
    "we have the same equilibrium as the original adaptive ( and full atomistic ) system and the difference between the work of the original thermodynamic force and the work of the thermodynamic force calculated in the hamiltonian approach gives @xmath31 ( further details about this point are given in the appendix  [ app : tmp2 ] ) .",
    "moreover we have proven numerically , for the case of liquid water , that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the atomistic and coarse - grained potential . it must be noticed that the auxiliary hamiltonian approach shall not be considered a hamiltonian approach to adaptive resolution simulation . in fact , as discussed in ref.@xcite the equilibrium",
    "is imposed artificially and _ per se _ does not have any physical meaning ( for more details , see discussion in the appendix  [ app : tmp2 ] ) . in the next section of this work",
    "we show analytically that the formula above is exact ( at least ) at the first order w.r.t .",
    "the probability distribution of the system as defined in eq.[order ] .",
    "the result above implies that @xmath30 can be calculated in a straightforward way during the initial equilibration within in the standard gc - adress code .",
    "it must be noticed that , within the adress scheme , an approach similar to the auxiliary hamiltonian has been recently proposed and applied to liquids and mixtures ( of toy models so far ) by potestio _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite where such an approach is commented ) . at this point according to , if one knows @xmath27 , then gc - adress can automatically provide @xmath28 .",
    "however we need to do one step more , in fact the quantity of interest is not the total chemical potential , but the excess chemical potential @xmath36 which corresponds to the expression of where the kinetic ( ideal gas ) part is subtracted . regarding the kinetic part",
    ", one can notice that the contribution coming from the com is the same for the coarse - grained and for the atomistic molecules , thus it is automatically removed in the calculation of .",
    "the kinetic part of @xmath28 due to the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom corresponds in our case to @xmath32 and in principle can be calculated by hand ( chemical potential of an isolated molecules ) .",
    "however such a calculation may become rather tedious for large and/or complex molecules but in our case it is actually not required .",
    "in fact the gromacs implementation of adress considers the removed degrees of freedom as phantom variables but thermally equilibrate them anyway  @xcite .",
    "thus the heat provided by the thermostat for the rotational and vibrational part is the same in the atomistic and coarse - graining molecules and is automatically removed in the difference .",
    "finally , the calculation of @xmath37 can be done with standard methods , ti or ipm , which for simple spherical molecules , like those of the coarse - grained system , requires a negligible computational cost . in conclusion",
    ", we have the final expression : @xmath38",
    "in this section we derive analytically the equivalence : @xmath39 and define its conceptual limitations .",
    "we consider a potential coupling between the atomistic and coarse - grained resolution , that is the spatial interpolation of the atomistic and coarse - grained potential , as done instead for the forces in the standard adress : @xmath40    u^{{\\textrm{cg}}}_{i , j},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the atomistic and coarse - grained interaction potential between molecule @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , defined by @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 denotes the atom indices of the corresponding molecule .",
    "the com of the molecule is defined as : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the mass of atom @xmath44 of molecule @xmath2 .",
    "the potential interpolation   provides an auxiliary hamiltonian to the adress system , and the corresponding intermolecular force is given by : @xmath48    { \\textbf{\\textit{f}}}_{i , j}^{{\\textrm{cg}}}-    \\nabla_{{\\textbf{\\textit{r } } } } w({\\textbf{\\textit{r}}}_i ) w({\\textbf{\\textit{r}}}_j )    ( u^{{\\textrm{{at}}}}_{i , j } - u^{{\\textrm{cg}}}_{i , j}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we refer to the adress simulation using potential scheme   as auxiliary hamiltonian adress , and all properties of this approach will be added a superscript `` h '' .",
    "we define the force of changing representation by @xmath49    we use the same notation as in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic variables for the atomistic and coarse - grained regions are denoted by @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the transition region is an infinitely thin filter ( that is a much smaller region than the atomistic and coarse - grained region ) that allows molecules to change resolution as they cross it .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath18 are the total volume and total number of molecules of the system . in this work ,",
    "we adopt the same assumptions as those listed in sec.iii.c of ref .",

    ", @xmath54 provides the balance of the grand potential or equivalently @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the work of the thermodynamic force @xmath54 .",
    "+ instead when we consider the auxiliary hamiltonian approach , the third term on the r.h.s .  of eq .   is not symmetric w.r.t molecules @xmath2 and @xmath3 , therefore , the newton s action - reaction law ( momentum conservation ) does not hold anymore . as a consequence ,",

    "@xmath71 is the linear dimension of the transition region along @xmath61 . since the resolution changes only along @xmath61 , the two one - particle forces depend only on @xmath61 , and only have the component along @xmath61",
    "this can be easily generalized to changing resolution in any direction , i.e. , replacing @xmath61 by @xmath72 .",

    "we have checked that the conservation holds for systems without electrostatics ( methane , ethane , propane ) , thus for such systems the procedure is straightforward . instead , for systems with electrostatic interactions , even for full atomistic simulations , due to the fact that the force fields are designed for employing the reaction field method ,",
