    "the prevalence of structure in the halo of the milky way ( mw ) , with orbital debris reaching out to its farthest extent , is a relatively recent discovery that gives visible testament to the assembly history of our galaxy .",
    "our knowledge of this structure is due primarily to large - area / all - sky , multiband photometric surveys such as sdss , and more recently panstarrs and the dark energy survey ( des ) , to name a few . adding to the traditional eleven dwarf spheroidal galaxy satellites of the mw known since the mid - twentieth century , tens of more have been discovered along with distant globular clusters and various tidal streams and features ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ascertaining the properties of these star systems , their relation to our galaxy and to one another , provides the most detailed and accurate picture of galaxy - formation on small scales where tensions with current cosmological models exist .",
    "one such property of these star systems that too often remains unmeasured is their tangential velocities , or absolute proper motions .",
    "these motions are critical to deciphering the dynamical aspects of the assembly process of the mw . because of the needed astrometric precision",
    ", most proper - motion studies of distant satellites have made use of the hubble space telescope ( @xmath4 ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* review ) , and much is expected in the not - too - distant future from the ongoing esa space mission , gaia . here",
    "we introduce a first result from a new , ground - based program that instead uses archival images taken with wide - field imagers with appropriate scale ( @xmath5/pixel ) mated to large ( 4 to 8 m class ) telescopes .",
    "archives now include images separated by as much as 10 years , that are sufficiently deep ( to @xmath6 ) and wide ( tens of arcmin ) .",
    "such images include tens of thousands of background galaxies that can be used to anchor the measured proper motions to an inertial reference system .",
    "there are a number of reasons to undertake such a program .",
    "first , it is complementary to @xmath4 and gaia",
    ". it is often the case that @xmath4 will not have first - epoch observations appropriate to determine proper motions for the newly discovered ultra faint dwarf galaxies and remote globular clusters , while gaia s limiting magnitude of @xmath7 will not reach the main sequence of these rather sparse systems .",
    "second , most existing and planned ( e.g. , lsst ) wide - field , deep imaging surveys have yet to have their astrometric potential properly exploited , in the context of providing large numbers of scientifically useful proper motions . tapping this potential requires an astrometric modeling of the detector and telescope system , and here we lay the groundwork with one such methodology .",
    "third , the shear number of galaxies and stars per unit area and magnitude in these deep , wide - field images is somewhat novel in this type of work ( and represents a precursor to lsst ) .",
    "these numbers allow us to explore various sources of systematic errors , and better understand the limitations of our proper - motion measurement .",
    "fourth , there is an interesting by - product of this type of wide and deep proper - motion study : finding fast - moving , faint objects as candidate cool dwarfs and white dwarfs .",
    "we present here a test - case study in the field of the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( dsph ) using images taken with the subaru prime focus camera , suprime - cam @xcite . the data span three epochs with time baselines of 4.4 and 7 years , and cover a total of 0.2 square degrees to a limiting magnitude of @xmath8 .",
    "the resulting proper - motion measurement for draco indicates a rather eccentric orbit with a pericenter of @xmath3 kpc , and currently having just passed its apocenter . within uncertainties ,",
    "draco s orbit is marginally consistent with membership to the vast polar structure described by @xcite , although it shows a poorer alignment with this structure than what the recent @xmath4 proper - motion measurement indicates ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p15 ) .",
    "we have searched the subaru mitaka okayama kiso archive system ( smoka ) , @xcite for observations taken with the suprime - cam @xcite centered on the draco dwarf galaxy .",
    "we found data taken in 2001 , 2004 , 2005 and 2008 .",
    "the 2004 data set was very shallow and of poor quality , therefore we have discarded it from further analysis .",
    "the data sets to be used in our proper - motion study ( i.e. , those with considerable overlap ) total 94 individual exposures .",
    "the characteristics of these exposures  date , filter , exposure time ( in seconds ) , and number of frames per data set  are listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "eventually , due to proper - motion determination limits , we used only 85 exposures for the final proper motion catalog .",
    ".observation log [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < \" , ]     these objects do not appear in the simbad database , or the johnston list of brown dwarfs database . while bdc1 is in the allwise source catalogue @xcite with clear detections in bands @xmath9 and @xmath10 , bdc2 does not appear in this catalogue . for bdc1 , the allwise magnitudes of @xmath11 and @xmath12 suggest that the object has a spectral type between m6 and l2 @xcite . using the absolute magnitude calibration from @xcite , we infer a distance of between 95 and 48 pc , based on these two spectral types , respectively . given the high proper motion with respect to stars of similar color , we think it more likely to be closer to the cooler spectral type , and thus nearer the lower end of that distance range .",
    "the galactic coordinates imply a geometry in which the line - of - sight velocity translates into rotational velocity about the galaxy , and in which the proper motion along galactic latitude is mostly projected onto the @xmath13 component . if we adopt a heliocentric radial velocity of 0 km  s@xmath2 ( i.e. , the star is moving about the galaxy much like the sun ) , then the vertical velocity is @xmath14 km  s@xmath2 for the lesser distance and @xmath15 km  s@xmath2 for the greater distance .",
    "both scenarios are thus compatible with membership to the thin disk , although at the greater distance , one must also consider the old disk , which has a higher velocity dispersion than the younger populations in the thin disk .",
    "the second candidate , bdc2 , is somewhat redder and , as such , is a stronger brown - dwarf candidate ; its color implying a temperature cooler than that of a typical l2 dwarf .",
    "it is also relatively faint , at @xmath16 .",
    "only two or three current brown - dwarf studies , taken in the ir with cfht and subaru telescopes , reach magnitudes fainter that this @xcite . thus we see great potential for deep , subaru - based proper - motion studies in discovering brown dwarf candidates .",
    "we have used a large set of deep images taken with suprime - cam on the subaru 8-m telescope to measure the absolute proper motion of the draco dsph galaxy .",
    "the data comprise two- and three - epoch determinations with a time baseline of 4.4 and 7 years . while the exposures reach a limiting magnitude of @xmath17 , we limit the proper - motion study to @xmath18 .",
    "the area coverage of the entire catalog is 0.2 square degrees ; that used for the determination of the proper motion of draco is 0.148 square degrees . importantly ,",
    "the images provide thousands of background galaxies and draco members with which we perform unprecedentedly detailed tests to explore systematic errors in the proper motions .",
    "we obtain an absolute proper motion of high precision , comparable to that of a recent 2-year baseline @xmath4 determination .",
    "our result disagrees with the @xmath4 measurement in @xmath19 , at the @xmath20 level .",
    "while we discuss possible sources of error , we can not identify a cause for this discrepancy . because of this difference in motion , the orbit determined here is significantly different from that based on the @xmath4 measurement .",
    "our subaru - based orbit is less energetic , and thus more disruptive than the @xmath4 one .",
    "our orbit with a pericentric passage of @xmath3 kpc suggests a scenario in which tides may , in part , account for the increasing line - of - sight velocity dispersion in the outer regions of draco @xcite .    we have also searched for brown - dwarf stars in our catalogue and find two likely candidates , based on their large proper motions and red colors .",
    "the full set of proper motions derived in this study is availabe upon request to the first author .",
    "this work was funded , in part , by the nasa connecticut space grant college consortium matched with equal funds from southern connecticut state university .",
    "it makes use of data collected at the subaru telescope and obtained from the smoka , which is operated by the astronomy data center , national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee whose suggestions helped improve this manuscript .",
