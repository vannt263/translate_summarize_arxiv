    "this result also follows from cauchy s theorem in the complex squared energy plane , together with the assumption of quark - hadron duality , to wit .",
    "given a green function @xmath21 , e.g. @xmath22 , and an analytic function @xmath23 , cauchy s theorem leads to @xmath24 where the discontinuity across the real axis involves the hadronic sector , and the contour integral requires asymptotic information if the integration radius @xmath25 is large enough . according to quark - hadron ( global ) duality @xmath21 is assumed to be given by the qcd operator product expansion ( ope ) . a warning about this assumption",
    "was first raised long ago in @xcite , and is now referred to as potential duality violations associated with the qcd behaviour on or close to the positive real axis .",
    "tests of the wsr were performed @xcite-@xcite using experimental data on @xmath26-decays from the argus collaboration at desy @xcite , and later @xcite from the aleph collaboration @xcite .",
    "both determinations led to a better saturation of the wsr if an integral kernel , e.g. a non - trivial @xmath23 in eq.(7 ) , was introduced , e.g. such that @xmath27 .",
    "this was interpreted in @xcite as a possible signal of duality violations , on account of a considerably improved saturation of the wsr obtained with a _ pinched _",
    "kernel @xcite , @xcite @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath29\\nonumber \\\\ [ .3 cm ] & = & 2\\ ;   f_\\pi^2 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this paper we discuss the extension of the wsr to finite temperature , which requires reliable information on the thermal behaviour of the hadronic spectral functions .",
    "this information is available from results obtained from finite energy qcd sum rules ( fesr ) at finite @xmath30 in the vector @xcite and independently in the axial - vector channel @xcite .",
    "starting with the hadronic vector spectral function , in the analysis of @xcite it was parametrized by a breit - wigner form @xmath31 where the upper index ( + ) specifies the time - like region ( @xmath32 ) , and all parameters depend on the temperature , and are normalized at @xmath0 as follows @xcite : @xmath33 , @xmath34 gev , and @xmath35 gev .",
    "this parametrization was then used in the first three fesr @xmath36 & - & \\frac{s_0^n}{n } \\left[1+{\\mathcal{o}}(\\alpha_s)\\right ] \\;\\ ; ( n=1,2,\\cdots ) \\;,\\label{fesr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the leading order vacuum condensates in the chiral limit are the dimension @xmath37 gluon condensate and the dimension @xmath38 four - quark condensate .",
    "the fesr were then used to determine @xmath39 , i.e. the onset of pqcd , and to check that the resulting dimension @xmath37 and @xmath38 vacuum condensates were in agreement with independent determinations from data analyses .",
    "alternative parametrizations were also considered but found to lead to similar results .        extending this analysis to finite temperature gave the following results @xmath40 with @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44}\\;,\\ ] ] @xmath45 where @xmath46 , allowed to vary in the range @xmath47 , and finally @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "+ turning to the axial - vector hadronic resonance parametrization , a fit was made to the aleph data on @xmath26-decay in order to use as the @xmath0 normalization .",
    "as in the vector channel , the first three fesr were employed to determine @xmath25 and to check consistency of the results for the dimension @xmath51 condensates .",

    "the finite temperature results for @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 can be written generically as @xmath65 where the various coefficients are given in table i. the @xmath5 mass hardly changes with temperature , so that it was kept constant .",
    "this behaviour can be ascribed to the very large width of the @xmath5 resonance .",
    "it should be noticed the ( different ) way the leptonic decay constants enter their respective spectral functions . however , the full @xmath30-dependence of these functions is the result of the aggregate behaviour of all their parameters .",
    "this @xmath30-dependence is consistent with a quark deconfinement scenario in both channels .",
    "+ the parametrization of the spectral function in the vector channel was later used to predict the dimuon production spectrum in heavy ion collisions at high energies @xcite .",
    "excellent agreement was obtained after comparing with data on in - in collision around the @xmath4-meson peak from the na60 collaboration @xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows the experimental data and the prediction using the vector spectral function from @xcite , as reproduced here in eqs.(9 ) , ( 11)-(14 ) .",
    "+ it should be clear from figs . ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) that the vector spectral function evolves with increasing @xmath30 independently of the axial - vector one .",
    "the latter involves , in addition to the @xmath5 resonance , the pion pole given by @xmath66 .",
    "this contribution vanishes at @xmath6 , signaling chiral - symmetry restoration , i.e. a transition from a nambu - goldstone to a wigner - weyl realization of chiral @xmath7 symmetry",
    ". it should be recalled that the thermal quark condensate from lattice qcd has been used as input to the fesr in the axial - vector channel in @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite the @xmath30-dependence of the ratio@xmath67 follows closely that of @xmath68 , vanishing at the same temperature within the accuracy of the method .",
    "this independent and clearly very different approach to @xmath6 exhibited by the thermal spectral functions does not suggest any potential chiral mixing .",
    "ccccc + parameter & @xmath5 & @xmath69 & @xmath70 & @xmath71 + @xmath61 & - 28.5 & -0.6689 & 35.60 & 3.93 + @xmath62 & - 0.2924 & - 0.7557 & 73.43 & 11.08 + @xmath63 & - 19.34 & 14.27 & 7.716 & 6.153 + @xmath64&2.323 & 1.207 & 20.24 & 7.869 +            in the qcd sector the pqcd spectral functions for both @xmath32 ( _ annihilation _ ) and @xmath72 ( _ scattering _ ) , as well as the dimension @xmath37 gluon condensate are chiral symmetric , thus not contributing to eq.(6 ) . in the hadronic sector for @xmath72 ( _ scattering _ )",
    "there is an asymmetric contribution from pion loops , which in the vector channel at leading order is @xcite @xmath73      & = & \\frac{t^2}{9 } \\ ; \\delta(s ) \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the bose thermal function .",
    "the corresponding contribution in the axial - vector channel is a higher order two - loop effect , which is traditionally neglected .",
    "starting at @xmath0 and using the results from the three fesr obtained in @xcite-@xcite , i.e. @xmath75 and the parametrizations eq.(9 ) and eqs.(15)-(17 ) , the wsr , eq.(6 ) , and the pinched wsr , eq.(8 ) , are satisfied to better than 1% .",
    "the corresponding results at finite @xmath30 are shown in fig . 4 for the first wsr , @xmath76 , eq.(6 ) , and in fig . 5 for the pinched wsr , @xmath77 , eq .",
    "the solid ( dash ) lines correspond to the left ( right ) hand sides of the sum rules . clearly , the upper limit of integration in the wsr , i.e. @xmath61 , is not strictly chiral - symmetric , as seen from eqs.(11 ) and ( 18 ) .",
    "the divergence between the left and the right hand sides of the wsr at high @xmath30 is due to the asymmetric hadronic _ scattering _ term present in the vector spectral function , but loop suppressed in the axial - vector channel .",
    "the importance of this term is short lived , as it must disappear at @xmath6 , since there would be no longer pions in the medium . in any case , since the source of this contribution is fully understood , it should not be interpreted as an invalidation of the thermal wsr . + as indicated in figs .",
    "4 - 5 the wsr are very well satisfied up to @xmath78 .",
    "the source of the departure between the left hand side of the wsr and its right hand side , i.e. @xmath79 , or alternatively the thermal quark condensate @xmath80 , is well understood .",
    "it is due to the two - pion loop contribution to the vector spectral function , growing like @xmath3 , but disappearing at @xmath6 .",
    "if this contribution would have been chiral symmetric , then it would have canceled out and the wsr would have been fully satisfied up to @xmath6 .",
    "+ the results for the behaviour of the wsr in the full temperature range can be interpreted as follows .",
    "first of all , at @xmath0 the wsr make the highly non - trivial statement that the integrated difference between the vector and the axial - vector ( including the pion ) spectral functions vanishes .",
    "these functions could not be more different , i.e. the vector correlator has no pole , and the ground state resonance is narrow , while the axial - vector involves a pole and a very broad resonance almost twice as heavy .",
    "next , there is no a - priori reason for the wsr to be satisfied at finite temperature .",
    "their original derivation was done in the context of current algebra and chiral @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "today we reinterpret them in the framework of qcd , which does exhibit this chiral symmetry in the limit of vanishing light quark masses . in principle , an extension to finite @xmath30 could lead to more than one scenario , including one in which the sum rules are not satisfied at all , except at @xmath6 where they must be trivially satisfied .",
    "the results obtained from thermal qcd fesr @xcite-@xcite clearly indicate that the vector spectral function evolves with @xmath30 independently of the axial - vector spectral function .",
    "while both disappear at @xmath6 , they do so following their own distinctive thermal evolution .",
    "in other words , there is no a - priori relation between these two channels , unless one were to demand it .",
    "given the successful saturation of the wsr there seems to be no reason to justify such a demand .",
    "the behaviour of the spectral function parameters points to deconfinement , as the onset of pqcd , @xmath61 , and the resonance couplings decrease , while the widths increase substantially with increasing @xmath30 .",
    "this results in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 resonances becoming progressively broader , with decreasing couplings to their respective currents . at the same time , the pion decay constant / quark condensate decreases with increasing @xmath30 , vanishing at @xmath2 .",
    "the thermal behaviour of the hadron mass is irrelevant in the context of the approach to deconfinement .",
    "in fact , the mass only specifies the position of the real part of the resonance green function in the complex squared energy @xmath81-plane .",
    "its moving upwards or downwards with temperature is no indication of a deconfinement phase transition .",
    "it is the imaginary part of the green function , i.e. the hadronic width , the relevant parameter in this context .",
    "its considerable increase with increasing temperature thus serves as a phenomenological signal for deconfinement .",
    "+ alternative analyses of the thermal wsr have been performed recently @xcite , with somewhat different emphasis , e.g. in connection with potential chiral mixing .",
