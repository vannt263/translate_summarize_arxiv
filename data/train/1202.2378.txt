    "in the quest to understand the production of the heaviest elements in the universe , several invaluable datasets for testing nucleosynthesis models are available , including the isotopic and elemental abundance patterns found in meteorites , the solar photosphere , and metal - poor halo stars . all elements heavier than the iron group",
