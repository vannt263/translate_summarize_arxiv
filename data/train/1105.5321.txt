    "in this paper we discuss two models . the first model is a minijet model@xcite .",
    "the second is a glasma flux tube model ( gftm)@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner :    sec .",
    "1 is the introduction and review of models .",
    "2 discuss two particle angular correlation in the two models .",
    "3 discuss baryon and anti - baryon formation in both models .",
    "sec . 4 demonstrates how the ridge is formed by flux tubes when a jet trigger is added to the gftm . sec .",
    "5 treats the so - called mach cone effect by analyzing three particle angular correlations in the two models .",
    "6 presents the summary and discussion .",
    "the analysis of angular correlations led to unanticipated structure in the final state of p - p and au - au collisions , subsequently identified with parton fragmentation in the form of minijets[3 - 7 ] .",
    "two - component analysis of p - p and au - au spectra revealed a corresponding hard component , a minimum - bias fragment distribution associated with minijets , suggesting that jet phenomena extend down to 0.1 gev / c@xcite . from a given p - p or au - au collisions particles",
    "are produced with three kinematic variables ( @xmath4,@xmath5,@xmath6 ) .",
    "the @xmath6 spectra provide information about parton fragmentation , but the fragmentation process is more accessible on a logarithmic momentum variable .",
    "the dominant hadron ( pion ) is ultrarelativistic at 1 gev / c , and a relativistic kinematic variable is a reasonable alternative .",
    "transverse rapidity in a longitudinally comoving frame near midrapidity @xmath4=0 is defined by    @xmath7/m_0),\\ ] ]    with @xmath8 a hadron mass and @xmath9 = @xmath10 + @xmath11 .",
    "if one integrates over @xmath5 the event multiplicity ( @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 , the 1d density on @xmath4 ) can be written for p - p collision in a two component model as    @xmath15    @xmath16 is a levy distribution on @xmath17 which represents soft processes and @xmath18 is a gaussian on @xmath19 which represents hard processes .",
    "the soft process has no @xmath5 dependence but does have a gaussian correlation in the longitudinal direction(@xmath4 ) .",
    "this correlation can be expressed in a two particle way as @xmath20 which is the difference of the psuedorapidity .",
    "@xmath21.\\ ] ]    the hard process arise from a scattering of two partons thus minijets are formed .",
    "each minijet fragments along its parton axis and generates a 2d correlation @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24exp[-\\delta \\eta^2/2\\sigma_{\\eta}^2].\\ ] ]    since for every minijet fragmenting leading to a peak at @xmath25 = @xmath26 , there is its scattered partner in the backward direction @xmath25 = @xmath27 .",
    "the backward scattered minijet will range over many psuedorapidity values , therefore its correlation with the fragmentation of the near side minijet will have a broad @xmath28 width . in this condition",
    "simple momentum conservation is good enough and that is a @xmath29 term .",
    "the two - component model of hadron production in a - a collisions assumes that the soft component is proportional to the participant pair number ( linear superposition of n - n collisions ) , and the hard component is proportional to the number of n - n binary collisions ( parton scattering)@xcite .",
    "any deviations from the model are specific to a - a collisions and may reveal properties of an a - a medium . in terms of mean participant path length @xmath30 = 2@xmath31/@xmath32 the @xmath6-integrated",
    "a - a hadron density on @xmath4 is    @xmath33    by analogy with eg .",
    "( 2 ) a - a density as a function of centrality parameter @xmath30 becomes    @xmath34    in the above equation @xmath35 = @xmath36 and @xmath37 = @xmath38 which is p - p scattering or nucleon - nucleon scattering .",
    "we also can define for the hard density for a - a collisions in terms of @xmath30 as @xmath39 = @xmath40 . the density 2/@xmath32 1/2@xmath41 1/@xmath19 @xmath42/@xmath43@xmath44 for pions as a function of @xmath19 at @xmath0=200 gev for p - p , au - au , and @xmath37 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "we see from the above equation the @xmath35 is universal and scales with the participant pairs .",
    "this means we can extract @xmath45 from the density measured in p - p and au - au at @xmath0=200 gev from figure 1 giving us figure 2 .",
    "finally the ratio @xmath46/@xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) is plotted in figure 3 . in the au - au central collision ( 0 - 12% ) at a @xmath19 value of 2 ( @xmath6=0.5 gev / c ) there is 5 times as many pions coming from minijet fragmentation as there is in a n - n collision .",
    "this implies a large increase in correlated pion fragments and should show up as an increased in two particle angular correlations .",
    "we will see this in sec . 2 where we show these angular correlations and discuss the number of particles in the minijets .",
    "the common measurement of parton energy loss is expressed as a nuclear modification factor @xmath48 .",
    "the hard - component ratio @xmath49 measured over @xmath19 ( @xmath6 ) provides similar information .",
    "note that @xmath19 = 5 ( @xmath6=10 gev / c ) @xmath49 = 0.2 which is the same value calculated for @xmath48 .",
    "this value is considered caused by jet quenching as partons are absorbed by the opaque medium .",
    "however in the minijet picture suggests that no partons are lost in a - a collisions . their manifestation ( in spectrum structure and correlations )",
    "is simply redistributed within the fragment momentum distribution , and the fragment number increases .",
    "a high-@xmath6 triggered jet yield may be reduced by a factor of five within a particular @xmath6 range , but additional fragments emerge elsewhere , still with jet - like correlation structure@xcite .",
    "a glasma flux tube model ( gftm)@xcite that had been developed considers that the wavefunctions of the incoming projectiles , form sheets of color glass condensates ( cgc)@xcite that at high energies collide , interact , and evolve into high intensity color electric and magnetic fields .",
    "this collection of primordial fields is the glasma@xcite , and initially it is composed of only rapidity independent longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields .",
    "an essential feature of the glasma is that the fields are localized in the transverse space of the collision zone with a size of 1/@xmath50 .",
    "@xmath50 is the saturation momentum of partons in the nuclear wavefunction .",
    "these longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields generate topological chern - simons charge@xcite which becomes a source for particle production .",
    "the transverse space is filled with flux tubes of large longitudinal extent but small transverse size @xmath1@xmath51 .",
    "particle production from a flux tube is a poisson process , since the flux tube is a coherent state .",
    "the flux tubes at the center of the transverse plane interact with each other through plasma instabilities@xcite and create a locally thermalized system , where partons emitted from these flux tubes locally equilibrate .",
    "a hydro system with transverse flow builds causing a radially flowing blast wave@xcite .",
    "the flux tubes that are near the surface of the fireball get the largest radial flow and are emitted from the surface .",
    "@xmath50 is around 1 gev / c thus the transverse size of the flux tube is about 1/4fm .",
    "the flux tubes near the surface are initially at a radius @xmath15fm .",
    "the @xmath5 angle wedge of the flux tube is @xmath11/20 radians or @xmath1@xmath52 .",
    "thus the flux tube initially has a narrow range in @xmath5 .",
    "the width in @xmath28 correlation of particles results from the independent longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields that created the glasma flux tubes . in this paper",
    "we relate particle production from the surface flux tube to a related model parton bubble model(pbm)@xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that for central au - au collisions at @xmath0=200 the pbm is a good approximation to the gftm surface flux tube formation .",
    "the flux tubes on the surface turn out to be on the average 12 in number .",
    "they form an approximate ring about the center of the collision see figure 4 .",
    "the twelve tube ring creates the average behavior of tube survival near the surface of the expanding fire ball of the blast wave .",
    "the final state surface tubes that emit the final state particles at kinetic freezeout are given by the pbm .",
    "one should note that the blast wave surface is moving at its maximum velocity at freezeout ( 3c/4 ) .",
    "the space momentum correlation of the blast wave provides us with a strong angular correlation signal .",
    "pythia fragmentation functions@xcite were used for the tube fragmentation that generate the final state particles emitted from the tube .",
    "the initial transverse size of a flux tube @xmath11/4fm has expanded to the size of @xmath12fm at kinetic freezeout .",
    "many particles that come from the surface of the fireball will have a @xmath6 greater than 0.8 gev / c .",
    "the final state tube size and the hanbury - brown and twiss ( hbt ) observations@xcite of pions that have a momentum range greater than 0.8 gev / c are consistent both being @xmath12fm .",
    "a single parton using pythia forms a jet with the parton having a fixed @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "for central events each of the twelve tubes have 3 - 4 partons per tube each at a fixed @xmath5 for a given tube .",
    "the @xmath6 distribution of the partons is similar to pqcd but has a suppression at high @xmath6 like the data .",
    "the 3 - 4 partons in the tube which shower using pythia all have a different @xmath4 values but all have the same @xmath5 ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "the pbm explained the high precision au - au central ( 0 - 10% ) collisions at @xmath53 200 gev@xcite(the highest rhic energy ) .",
    "we utilize a two particle correlation function in the two dimensional ( 2-d ) space where @xmath5 is the azimuthal angle of a particle measured in a clockwise direction about the beam .",
    "@xmath20 which is the difference of the psuedorapidity of the pair of particles ] of @xmath25 versus @xmath28 .",
    "the 2-d total correlation function is defined as :    @xmath54    where s(@xmath55 ) is the number of pairs at the corresponding values of @xmath55 coming from the same event , after we have summed over all the events .",
    "m(@xmath55 ) is the number of pairs at the corresponding values of @xmath55 coming from the mixed events , after we have summed over all our created mixed events .",
    "a mixed event pair has each of the two particles chosen from a different event .",
    "we make on the order of ten times the number of mixed events as real events .",
    "we rescale the number of pairs in the mixed events to be equal to the number of pairs in the real events .",
    "this procedure implies a binning in order to deal with finite statistics .",
    "the division by m(@xmath55 ) for experimental data essentially removes or drastically reduces acceptance and instrumental effects . if the mixed pair distribution was the same as the real pair distribution c(@xmath55 )",
    "should have unit value for all of the binned @xmath55 . in the correlations used in this paper we select particles independent of its charge .",
    "the correlation of this type is called a charge independent ( ci ) correlation .",
    "this difference correlation function has the defined property that it only depends on the differences of the azimuthal angle ( @xmath25 ) and the beam angle ( @xmath28 ) for the two particle pair .",
    "thus the two dimensional difference correlation distribution for each tube or minijet which is part of c(@xmath55 ) is similar for each of the objects and will image on top of each other .",
    "we further divide the data ( see table i ) into @xmath6 ranges ( bins ) .    .the",
    "@xmath6 bins and the number of charged particles per bin with @xmath56 @xmath57 1.0 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the surface gftm we have thermalization and hydro flow for the soft particles , while all the two particle angular correlations come from the tubes on the surface .",
    "the charge particle spectrum of the gftm is given by a blastwave model and the direct tube fragmentation is only 20% of this spectrum .",
    "the initial anisotropic azimuthal distribution of flux tubes is transported to the final state leaving its pattern on the ring of final state flux tubes on the surface .",
    "this final state anisotropic flow pattern can be decomposed in a fourier series ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , ... ) .",
    "these coefficients have been measure@xcite and have been found to be important in central au - au collisions .",
    "we will come back to these terms later on when we consider three particle angular correlations .",
    "it was shown above that charged particle production differ between p - p and au - au at @xmath53 200 .",
    "high @xmath6 charged particles in au - au are suppressed compared to p - p for @xmath6 @xmath61 2.0 gev / c ( @xmath19 @xmath61 3.33 for pions ) .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath49 for pions which has a suppression starting at @xmath19 = 3.0 ( @xmath6 = 1.5 gev / c ) . this shift between suppression of charged particle at @xmath6 @xmath61 2.0",
    "gev / c and suppression of pions at @xmath6 = 1.5 gev / c is made up by an enhancement of baryons@xcite .",
    "proton @xmath49 ( see figure 12 ) which is the most numerous baryon shows an enhancement starting at @xmath6 @xmath61 1.5 .",
    "this enhancement continues to @xmath6 = 4.0 ( @xmath19 = 4.0 ) is calculated using a pion mass . ] . finally at @xmath6=10.0 gev / c ( @xmath19 = 5.0 ) @xmath49 = 0.2 which is the same value as pions .",
    "there is no _ a priori model for the proton hard component .",
    "the excess in the proton hard component _ appears anomalous , but may be simply explained in terms of parton energy loss@xcite . _ _",
    "we have shown previously that inside the tube there are three to four partons with differing longitudinal momenta all at the same @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath6 distribution of the partons inside the tube is similar to pqcd but has a suppression in the high @xmath6 region like the data .",
    "the partons which are mainly gluons shower into more gluons which then fragment into quarks and anti - quarks which overlap in space and time with other quarks and anti - quarks from other partons .",
    "this leads to an enhance possibility for pairs of quarks from two different fragmenting partons to form a di - quark , since the recombining partons are localized together in a small volume .",
    "the same process will happen for pairs of anti - quarks forming a di - anti - quark .",
    "this recombination process becomes an important possibility in the gftm compared to regular jet fragmentation .",
    "since the quarks which overlap have similar phase space , the momentum of the di - quark is approximately twice the momentum of the quarks , but has approximately the same velocity .",
    "when mesons are formed quarks pick up anti - quarks with similar phase space from fragmenting gluons to form a color singlet state .",
    "thus the meson has approximately twice the momentum of the quark and anti - quark of which it is made . when the di - quark picks up a quark and forms a color singlet it will have approximately three times the momentum of one of the three quarks it is made from .",
    "thus we expect a @xmath6 spectrum scaling when we compare mesons to baryons .",
    "figure 12 shows the ratio protons plus anti - protons to charged particles as a function of @xmath6 for particles in our simulated central au - au collisions . in figure 12",
    "we also plot the ratio from central au - au rhic data@xcite .",
    "these experimental results agree well ( considering the errors ) with the gftm predictions for all charged particles .",
    "the background particles which came from hijing@xcite have the same ratios observed in p - p collisions , while particles coming from our tube have a much larger ratio .",
    "in heavy ion collisions at rhic there has been observed a phenomenon called the ridge which has many different explanations[28 - 35 ] .",
    "the ridge is a long range charged particle correlation in @xmath28 ( very flat ) , while the @xmath25 correlation is approximately jet - like ( a narrow gaussian ) .",
    "there also appears with the ridge a jet - like charged - particle - pair correlation which is symmetric in @xmath28 and @xmath25 such that the peak of the jet - like correlation is at @xmath28 = 0 and @xmath25 = 0 .",
    "the @xmath25 correlation of the jet and the ridge are approximately the same and smoothly blend into each other .",
    "the ridge correlation is generated when one triggers on an intermediate @xmath6 range charged particle and then forms pairs between that trigger particle and each of all other intermediate charged particles with a smaller @xmath6 down to some lower limit .",
    "triggered angular correlation data showing the ridge was presented at quark matter 2006@xcite .",
    "figure 14 shows the experimental @xmath25 vs. @xmath28 ci correlation for the 0 - 10% central au - au collisions at @xmath53 200 gev requiring one trigger particle @xmath6 between 3.0 and 4.0 gev / c and an associated particle @xmath6 above 2.0 gev / c .",
    "the yield is corrected for the finite @xmath28 pair acceptance .        in this paper",
    "we will investigate whether the gftm can account for the ridge once we add a jet trigger to gftm generator@xcite .",
    "however this trigger will also select jets which previously could be neglected because there was such strong quenching[37 - 39 ] of jets in central collisions when a jet trigger had not been used .",
    "we use hijing@xcite to determine the number of expected jets .",
    "we have already shown that our final state particles come from hadrons at or near the fireball surface .",
    "we reduce the number of jets by 80% which corresponds to the estimate that only the parton interactions on or near the surface are not quenched away , and thus at kinetic freezeout fragment into hadrons which enter the detector .",
    "this 80% reduction is consistent with single @xmath62 suppression observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we find for the reduced hijing jets that 4% of the au - au central events ( 0 - 5% ) centrality at @xmath53 200 have a charged particle with a @xmath6 between 3.0 and 4.0 gev / c with at least one other charged particle with its @xmath6 greater than 2.0 gev / c coming from the same jet . with the addition of the quenched jets to the generator , we then form two - charged - particle correlations between one - charged - particle with a @xmath6 between 3.0 to 4.0 gev / c and another charged - particle whose @xmath6 is greater than 2.0 gev / c .",
    "the results of these correlations are shown in figure 15 .",
    "we can compare the two figures , if we realize that the away - side ridge has around 420,000 pairs in figure 14 while in figure 14 the away - side ridge has a correlation of around 0.995 .",
    "if we multiply the correlation scale of figure 14 by 422,111 in order to achieve the number of pairs seen in figure 13 , the away - side ridge would be at 420,000 and the peak would be at 465,000 .",
    "this would make a good agreement between the two figures .",
    "we know in our monte carlo which particles come from tubes which would be particles form the ridge .",
    "the correlation formed by the ridge particles is generated almost entirely by particles emitted by the same tube .",
    "thus we can predict the shape and the yield of the ridge for the above @xmath6 trigger selection and lower cut , by plotting only the correlation coming from pairs of particles that are emitted by the same tube ( see figure 15 ) .",
    "in ref.@xcite it was assumed that the ridge yield was flat across the acceptance while in figure 14 we see that this is not the case .",
    "therefore our ridge yield is 35% larger than estimated in ref.@xcite .",
    "finally we can plot the jet yield that we had put into our monte carlo .",
    "the jet yield is plotted in figure 16 where we subtracted the tubes and the background particles from figure 14 .",
    "the phobos detector select triggered charged tracks with @xmath6 @xmath61 2.5gev / c within an acceptance of 0 @xmath57 @xmath63 @xmath57 1.5 .",
    "associated charge particles that escape the beam pipe are detected in a range @xmath64 @xmath57 3.0 .",
    "the ci correlation is shown in figure 17@xcite .",
    "the near - side structure is more closely examined by integrating over @xmath65 @xmath57 1 and is plotted in figure 18 as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "pythia simulation for p - p events is also shown .",
    "bands around the data points represent the uncertainty from flow subtraction .",
    "the error on the zyam procedure is shown as a gray band at zero .",
    "all systematics uncertainties are 90% confidence level .",
    "we generate using our above gftm the two - charged - particle correlations between one - charged - particle with a @xmath6 between greater than 2.5 gev / c which has an @xmath64 @xmath57 0.75 and another charged - particle whose @xmath6 is greater than 7 mev / c in a range @xmath64 @xmath57 3.0 .",
    "the results of this correlation is shown in figure 20 .",
    "we see that the triggered correlation is vary similar to the phobos results . in order to make a comparison we integrate the near - side structure over @xmath65 @xmath57 1 and plot it as a smooth curve in figure 21 as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "we also again plot the phobos points on the same plot .",
    "the long range correlation over @xmath28 produced by the gftm is possible and does not violate causality , since the glasma flux tubes are generated early in the collision . the radial flow which develops at a later time pushes the surface tubes outward in the same @xmath5 direction because the flow is purely radial . in order to achieve such an effect in minijet fragmentation",
    "one would have to have fragmentation moving faster than the speed of light .",
    "it was reported by the phenix collaboration@xcite that the shape of the away - side @xmath25 distributions for non - peripheral collisions are not consistent with purely stochastic broadening of the peripheral au - au away - side . the broadening and possible change in shape of the away - side jet",
    "are suggestive of a mach cone@xcite .",
    "the mach cone effect depended on the trigger particles and the associated particles used in the two particle angular correlations .",
    "the mach cone shape is not present if one triggers on 5 - 10 gev / c particles and also use hard associated particles greater than 3 gev / c@xcite .",
    "the away - side broadening in the two - particle depends on the @xmath59 subtraction and the method of smearing the away - side dijet component and momentum conservation .",
    "one needs to go beyond two particle correlations in order to learn more .",
    "a three particle azimuthal angle correlation should reveal very clear pattern for the mach cone compared to other two particle method .",
    "the star collaboration@xcite has made such correlation studies and does find a structure some what like a mach cone . however the trigger dependence as seen in ref.@xcite and the measurement of the conical emission angle to be independent of the associated particle @xmath6 in ref.@xcite is not consistent with a mach cone .",
    "the similarity of the mach cone and the ridge is very interesting to consider and makes one consider that they are the same effect . in the last section we showed that flux tubes can explain the ridge , thus they should explain the mach cone .",
    "one would not expect the minijet model will give a mach cone like correlation .",
    "we saw at the end of sec .",
    "2 that final state anisotropic flow pattern can be decomposed in a fourier series ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , ... ) . when one triggers on a particle coming from a flux tube , the other flux tubes contribute the components of the anisotropic flow pattern . in figure 22",
    "we show two such tube arrangements . in order to make contact with the data and show the difference between the minijet model and gftm we will define a trigger particle and a reference particle(s ) .",
    "we choose a @xmath6 of greater than 1.1 gev / c for the trigger and less than this value for the reference .",
    "the two particle correlation for this trigger and reference for the minijet model and the gftm are equal to each other .",
    "we define a three particle correlation using the azimuthal angle between a trigger particle 1 and a reference particle 2 ( @xmath66 ) and for the third particle the azimuthal angle between a trigger particle 1 and a reference particle 3(@xmath67 ) .",
    "the two particle correlation of the two models are the same and the three particle correlation is nearly the same . in order to obtain the true three particle effect we must remove the two particle correlation from the raw three particle correlation .",
    "this removal gives the so - called three particle cumulant .",
    "figure 22 and figure 23 shows the three particle cumulant for @xmath66 vs. @xmath67 for the minijet model and the gftm .",
    "the minijet model figure 22 shows only diagonal away - side response coming from the underlying dijet nature of the minijets .",
    "the gftm figure 23 also shows the diagonal away - side response of momentum conservation , however @xmath60 configurations of figure 21 gives an off - diagonal island at @xmath66 @xmath1 @xmath68 , @xmath67 @xmath1 @xmath69 or vice versa .",
    "let us look at the reported star data@xcite in order to address this off - diagonal effect . in figure 24",
    "we show the raw three particle results from star where ( a ) is the raw two particle correlation ( points ) .",
    "they also show in ( a ) the background formed from mixed events with flow modulation added - in ( solid ) .",
    "the background subtracted two particle correlation is shown as an inset in ( a ) where the double hump mach cone effect is clear . in figure 24(b ) the star raw three particle correlation is shown which required one trigger particle 3.0 @xmath57 @xmath6 @xmath57 4.0 gev / c and other reference particles 2 and 3 with 1.0 @xmath57 @xmath6 @xmath57 2.0 gev / c .",
    "an off - diagonal island does appear at @xmath66 @xmath1 2.3 , @xmath67 @xmath1 4.0 radians or vice versa .",
    "this is the same values as the island which occurs in the gftm and is the off - diagonal excess that is claimed to be the mach cone . like the ridge effect the mach cone seems to be the left overs of the initial state flux tube arrangements related to the fluctuations in the third harmonic .",
    "higher order harmonic fluctuations become less likely to survive to the final state .",
    "in this article we have made a comparison between two very different models for central au - au collisions .",
    "both models are successful at describing the the spectrum of particles produced and the two particle angular correlations observed in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the first model is a minijet model which assumes that around @xmath150 minijets are produced in back - to - back pairs and has an altered fragmentation function from that of vacuum fragmentation .",
    "it also assumes that the fragments are transparent and escape the collision zone and are then detected .",
    "the second model is a glasma flux tube model which leads to longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields confined in flux tubes on the surface of a radial expanding fireball driven by interacting flux tubes near the center of the fireball through plasma instabilities .",
    "this internal fireball becomes an opaque hydro fluid which pushes the surface flux tubes outward .",
    "around @xmath112 surface flux tubes remain and fragment with @xmath11/2 the produced particles escaping the collision zone and are detected .",
    "we expand our comparison to other phenomenon of the central collisions .",
    "we considered in sec . 3 baryon and anti - baryon formation in both models .",
    "there was no _ a priori reason for the excess in the minijet model , while in the glasma flux tube model(gftm ) recombination of quarks into di - quarks and anti - quark into anti - di - quarks leads to a natural excess of baryon and anti - baryon formation in this model .",
    "_    the formation of the ridge phenomena is discussed in sec .",
    "4 . in order to achieve a long range correlation effect in minijet fragmentation one would have to have fragmentation moving faster than the speed of light .",
    "the gftm however can have a long range correlation over @xmath28 since the glasma flux tubes are generated early in the collision .",
    "the radial flow which develops at a later time pushes the surface tubes outward in the same @xmath5 direction because the flow is purely radial .",
    "thus a long range @xmath28 last to the final state of the collision .",
    "a very good comparison was achieved between data and gftm .",
    "5 treats the so - called mach cone effect by analyzing three particle angular correlations in the two models . the minijet model and the gftm",
    "have the same two particle angular correlations but when the three particle azimuthal angular correlations are compared the two models differ .",
    "the minijet model shows only diagonal away - side response coming from the underlying dijet nature of the minijets , while gftm also shows a diagonal away - side response it also shows an off - diagonal island . like the ridge effect the mach cone seems to be left over from the initial state flux tube arrangements related to the fluctuations in the third harmonic(@xmath60 ) .",
    "this off - diagonal island excess is seen in the data and is claimed to be the mach cone .",
    "relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) collisions are conventionally described in terms of two major themes : hydrodynamic evolution of a thermal bulk medium and energy loss of energetic partons in that medium through gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "the minijet model is not consistent with is standard view .",
    "the glasma flux tube model generates a fireball which becomes an opaque hydro fluid that is consistent with conventional ideas .",
    "even though both models can obtain the same spectrum of particles and the same two particle angular correlations , it is only the gftm that can tie all together .",
