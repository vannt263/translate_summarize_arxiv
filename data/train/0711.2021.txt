    "the fundamental understanding of dynamically arrested states is a major challenge of contemporary statistical physics and materials science @xcite .",
    "model experimental colloidal suspensions , whose dynamics has been the subject of study on its own right @xcite , have played an essential role in the study of dynamic arrest phenomena , providing experimental realizations in finely - controlled systems and conditions @xcite . thus , it is an experimental fact that by changing a macroscopic control parameter such as the volume fraction , or by tuning the effective inter - particle interactions , one may drive the system from the region of equilibrium ( ergodic ) states to the region of dynamically arrested ( non - ergodic ) states .",
    "first - principles models and theories that predict and describe these transitions thus constitute an essential aspect of the fundamental understanding of these phenomena .",
    "the mode coupling theory ( mct ) of the ideal glass transition @xcite is perhaps the most comprehensive theory of this sort , some of whose predictions have found beautiful experimental confirmation @xcite . many issues , however , still remain to be understood , and this has prompted the proposal of extended versions of this theory @xcite , or the development of alternative approaches @xcite .    in this context , in recent work",
    "a new first - principles theory of dynamic arrest has been proposed @xcite which is essentially the application of the self - consistent generalized langevin equation ( scgle ) theory of colloid dynamics @xcite to the analysis of dynamic arrest phenomena in colloidal systems .",
    "the scgle theory was originally devised to describe the tracer and collective diffusion properties of colloidal dispersions in the short- and intermediate - times regimes .",
    "its self - consistent character , however , introduces a non - linear dynamic feedback , leading to the prediction of dynamic arrest in these systems , similar to that exhibited by the mode coupling ( mc ) theory of the ideal glass transition . the resulting theory of dynamic arrest in colloidal dispersions was applied in recent work to describe the glass transition in three mono - disperse experimental systems with specific ( hard - sphere , screened electrostatic , and depletion ) inter - particle effective forces @xcite , with the same quantitative predictive power as conventional mct , but with a smaller degree of difficulty in its application @xcite .",
    "the present paper introduces the multi - component extension of the scgle theory of colloid dynamics @xcite as a new alternative first - principles theory of dynamic arrest in colloidal mixtures .",
    "colloidal mixtures offer a richer variety of possible dynamic arrest scenarios @xcite .",
    "these include , for example , the possibility that the particles of one species become arrested , while the particles of the other species continue to diffuse through the disordered matrix of the arrested particles .",
    "in fact , an important prediction of the multi - component extension of mct @xcite was precisely the existence of these mixed states @xcite .",
    "later studies of dynamic arrest in mixtures @xcite have been based on mct not because it is the ultimate and definitive theory , but because it was virtually the only first - principles theory of dynamic arrest available that had a high level of predictive capability .",
    "however , relevant issues remain that have not been resolved by its application .",
    "for example , although the one - component version of mct predicts the existence of repulsive glasses in a hard - sphere system , and its melting upon the addition of a small amount of smaller particles ( depletion forces ) , followed by the reentrance to a new kind of ( attractive ) glass @xcite , no reentrance seems to be predicted by the two - component version of mct @xcite .",
    "issues like this merit the development of alternative approaches to the description of dynamic arrest phenomena in mixtures , particularly if they are independent from conventional mct .",
    "although the scgle theory presented here has several features in common with mct , such as its use of exact memory function expressions for the concentration - concentration time - correlation functions , in the scgle theory the derivations , approximations and argumentation are conceived and based on a totally different fundamental and conceptual framework @xcite .",
    "besides presenting the scgle theory of dynamic arrest in colloid mixtures , in the present paper we illustrate the scenarios predicted by this theory in the simplest conditions , namely , in its application to model binary mixtures . for two such systems , a repulsive yukawa mixture and a hard - sphere mixture , we numerically solve the full self consistent system of dynamic equations for the so - called propagators ( or green s functions ) of the self and collective intermediate scattering functions .",
    "we illustrate in this manner the two possible dynamic arrest patterns possible in a binary colloidal mixture , namely , the simultaneous and the sequential arrest of the two species . in the latter case",
    ", we discuss the hybrid or partially - arrested states in which one species is dynamically arrested while the other species remains ergodic .    determining the location of the ergodic ",
    "non - ergodic transitions and calculating the non - ergodic parameters may be done by solving the self - consistent system of equation or , more simply , by finding the long - time asymptotic stationary (  fixed - point \" ) solutions of the self - consistent system of equations .",
    "here we also address this issue , and report the derivation of a strikingly simple and general result which takes the form of a system of coupled equations for the localization length of the particles of each species . solving this system of equations leads to the unambiguous identification of",
    "which species is arrested ( finite localization length ) and which species remains ergodic ( infinite localization length ) . as a result , we are able to draw the entire ergodic  non - ergodic phase diagram of the binary hard - sphere mixture , which is one of the main specific contributions of this work .",
    "the present paper starts with a brief summary of the scgle theory of the dynamics of colloidal mixtures .",
    "this theory was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and tested there through its comparison with the short- and intermediate - time results of brownian dynamics computer simulations for a model colloidal mixture interacting through screened coulomb pair interactions .",
    "that original version of the scgle theory required as an input not only the partial static structure factors , but also other equilibrium static structural information associated with the exact short - time conditions that this initial version of the theory aimed at incorporating . as it has been shown more recently @xcite , however , a simplified version of the scgle theory , in which this exact short - time information is neglected , happens to be equally accurate , particularly in the long - time regime and with respect to the predicted dynamic arrest scenarios .",
    "thus , we shall refer to this simplified version simply as the scgle theory , which we review in the following section .",
    "although our main interest here is in the description of dynamic arrest phenomena , in section iii we start our discussion by reviewing the predictive capability of this simplified theory in the short- and intermediate - time regimes of the model binary yukawa mixture studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in one of the fully ergodic states considered in that work .",
    "we then proceed to illustrate the dynamic arrest scenarios predicted by this theory , by taking as the initial reference the same repulsive yukawa mixture , and increase the intensity of the repulsion parameter ( a process that amounts to effectively lowering the temperature ) , until reaching a transition to a dynamically arrested state .",
    "this turns out to be a transition from a fully ergodic to a fully arrested state in which both species are simultaneously arrested . in the second of our illustrative examples , in section",
    "iv we consider a hard - sphere model colloidal mixture , whose state parameters are the size disparity and the concentration of the two species . here",
    "we present an example of a transition to a partially arrested state , in which the large particles become arrested and the smaller particles continue to diffuse in the disordered matrix formed by the arrested species . in section",
    "v we derive the equations for the non - ergodic parameters of the system , and illustrate its use in the context of the hard - sphere binary mixture by determining its entire dynamic - arrest phase diagram .",
    "the main conclusions of this paper are finally summarized in section vi .",
    "in this section we summarize the main elements of the self- consistent theory of the dynamics of colloidal mixtures presented in refs .  @xcite . for a colloidal mixture with @xmath0 species ,",
    "the dynamic properties can be described in terms of the relaxation of the fluctuations @xmath1 of the local concentration @xmath2 of colloidal particles of species @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) around its bulk equilibrium value @xmath5 .",

    "let us denote the _ matrix _ with elements @xmath14 ( @xmath21 ) by @xmath22 or simply by @xmath23 , and similarly for @xmath24 .",
    "these matrices have the initial values @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the identity matrix , @xmath28 , and the elements of the matrix @xmath29 are the partial static structure factors , @xmath30 .",
    "the matrix of intermediate scattering functions may also be normalized by its initial value , to define the _ collective propagator _",
    "matrix @xmath31 , which is such that @xmath32 . in a similar manner",
    ", we define the _ self propagator _ matrix as @xmath33 , normalized to @xmath34 .",
    "the multi - component version of the scgle theory starts with the exact time - evolution equation that governs the relaxation of the fourier transform ( ft ) @xmath35 of the fluctuations of the local concentration of species @xmath3 .",
    "this equation also governs the relaxation of the partial intermediate scattering functions @xmath14 , and can be written as an exact expression for the laplace transform ( lt ) @xmath36 of the matrix @xmath23 , namely @xcite ,    @xmath37    where the elements of the matrix @xmath38 are given by @xmath39 , with @xmath40 being the diffusion coefficient of species @xmath3 in the absence of interactions .",

    "the corresponding result for the `` self '' component , @xmath46 , of the matrix @xmath36 reads    @xmath47    where the matrix @xmath48 is the corresponding irreducible memory function .",
    "the second ingredient of the scgle theory is the intuitive notion that collective and self dynamics may be connected in a simple manner .",
    "vineyard s approximation , in which @xmath49 is approximated by @xmath50 , is a rather primitive implementation of this idea .",
    "the scgle theory incorporates the same notion , but implemented at the level of the irreducible memory functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 , namely ,    @xmath53    which we shall simply refer as the vineyard - like approximation .",
    "let us mention that in the original proposal of the multi - component version of the scgle theory @xcite the difference @xmath54 $ ] was approximated not by zero , as in this equation , but by its exact (  single exponential \" ) short - time limit @xmath55 $ ] , given the fact that explicit expressions exist @xcite for the short - time limits @xmath56 and @xmath57 of the irreducible memory functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 in terms of equilibrium static structural properties of the system , which are considered known .",
    "more recently , however , it was found @xcite that an equally accurate but much simpler approximation results if the difference @xmath54 $ ] is approximated by zero , as in eq .",
    "( [ vineyard ] ) , thus eliminating the need to determine the short - time memory functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the third ingredient of the scgle theory was suggested @xcite as the interpolation of @xmath52 between its two exact limits at small and large wave - vectors , by means of a phenomenological but universal interpolation device .",
    "we know that the @xmath57 is also the exact large-@xmath58 limit of @xmath52 , whereas the small-@xmath58 limit is the so - called time - dependent friction function matrix @xmath59 .",

    "the final ingredient of the scgle theory is an approximate but general result for this property , which , as explained below , was derived as an application of the gle formalism @xcite to tracer diffusion phenomena .",

    "finally , let us mention that eqs .",
    "( [ fdz ] ) and ( [ fsdz ] ) are exact results , and that eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) derives from the exact result just referred to .",
    "hence , it should not be a surprise that the same results are employed by other theories ; in fact , these equations also appear in the formulation of mct .",
    "the difference lies , of course , in the way we relate them and use them ; in this sense , the distinctive elements of our theory are then the vineyard - like approximation in eq .",
    "( [ vineyard ] ) and the factorization approximation in eq .",
    "( [ interpolation ] ) .",
    "the set of coupled equations ( [ fdz])-([5 ] ) constitutes the self - consistent generalized langevin equation theory of the dynamics of colloidal mixtures , and has to be solved numerically . for this , equations ( [ fdz ] ) and ( [ fsdz ] ) are first laplace - inverted , and written as a set of coupled integro - differential equations involving functions of @xmath58 and @xmath13 .",
    "these functions are then discretized in a mesh of points large enough to ensure independence of the solution with respect to the size of the mesh .",

    "@xcite , and illustrates the fact that the present _ simplified _ scgle theory also provides an excellent description of the relaxation of concentration fluctuations in colloidal suspensions in the short- and intermediate - time regimes illustrated in the figure .",
    "we notice that the largest departures of the theoretical results from the simulation data appear only at the short times illustrated by the time @xmath112 , but the agreement improves at longer times , as illustrated by the time @xmath113 .",
    "the main message of this figure is that the present self - consistent theory of colloid dynamics provides an adequate description of the dynamic properties of a simple idealized mixture also in the short- and intermediate - time regimes , even though it does not satisfy the exact short - time conditions built in the original proposal of this theory @xcite . with this confidence ,",
    "let us now explore the long - time regime under conditions typical of the vicinity of a transition to dynamically arrested states .    for this",
    ", let us take the conditions of the middle column of fig . 1 as a reference , and",
    "let us keep the parameters @xmath114 and @xmath91 fixed ( @xmath115 and @xmath98 ) while we increase the coupling parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 in an identical proportion , to mimic a process of lowering the temperature .",
    "thus , let us write @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) , with @xmath118 and @xmath119 , and increase @xmath120 from its unit value in fig . 1 until a transition of dynamic arrest is encountered .",
    "in this case , we do not run computer simulations to provide the input partial static structure factors needed in the self - consistent scheme .",
    "instead , we resort to an approximate liquid state theory , namely , the solution of the ornstein - zernike integral equation within the hyper - netted - chain ( hnc ) approximation @xcite . in doing this we only loose quantitative precision , but no qualitative accuracy .",
    "in fact , the hnc approximation will yield the same scenario , but at effective values of the coupling parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 larger than the actual ones .",
    "for example , the fitting curves for the partial static structure factors in the middle column of fig .",
    "1 were obtained using the hnc approximation with effective coupling parameters given by @xmath116 with @xmath121 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] we present the results of the scgle theory for the diagonal elements @xmath122 of the collective propagator matrix @xmath49 as a function of time for fixed wave - vector @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the position of the main peak of the corresponding static structure factor @xmath64 .",
    "this figure illustrates the fact that as we lower the temperature starting from the reference state ( @xmath125 ) the system reaches eventually a transition to an arrested state .",
    "this occurs for @xmath126 , and @xmath127 , i.e. , for @xmath128 , and this is a transition from a fully ergodic to a fully arrested state , i.e. , both species become simultaneously arrested .",
    "this is evidenced by the fact that below this threshold condition , exemplified in the figure by the case @xmath129 , both propagators decay to zero , whereas above this condition , exemplified by the case @xmath130 , they decay to a finite non - ergodic value .",
    "thus , the non - ergodic parameters jump discontinuously at the transition , from zero in the ergodic side , to finite values in the glass side .",
    "exactly the same behavior is exhibited by the self - diffusion propagators @xmath131 and @xmath132 , not included in the present illustration .",
    "let us stress that this process of increasing @xmath89 and @xmath90 keeping @xmath91 fixed is a mathematical , rather than physical , exercise ; the practicable experimental manner to increase @xmath89 and @xmath90 would be to increase the particle s electric charge ( or to lower the dielectric constant of the solvent ) , which in reality would also increase the screening parameter @xmath91 . here",
    ", however , we use this exercise only to illustrate the pattern of dynamic arrest transition in colloidal mixtures in which the particles of both species become localized simultaneously .",
    "similar calculations can be carried out for other regions of the parameter space ( @xmath133 ) , but this scanning and its results in terms of other possible regions that exhibit interesting dynamic behavior constitutes an independent issue , beyond our current objective of introducing our scgle theory of dynamic arrest in mixtures and illustrating its use .",
    "we can mention , however , that in other regions of this state space the theory predicts also the other pattern of dynamic arrest , which we now illustrate in the context of a simpler system , namely , the hard - sphere colloidal mixture .",
    "let us now consider the binary hard spheres model dispersion , i.e. , the uncharged version of the previous system in which we now allow for hard - sphere size disparity .",
    "thus , we consider two species of particles of hard core diameters @xmath134 and @xmath135 , present at concentrations @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "we use as dimensionless control parameters the size asymmetry @xmath138 and either the two volume fractions @xmath105 and @xmath139 ( with @xmath140 ) , or the total packing fraction @xmath141 together with the molar fraction of the smaller species , @xmath142 .",
    "this system serves to illustrate some features associated precisely with the size disparity . as discussed in more detail below",
    ", one expects that for mild asymmetries the only possible mode of dynamic arrest for all volume fractions and all molar fractions is that in which both species are arrested simultaneously .",
    "it is only in the regime of disparate sizes that one expects a richer scenario , including the second mode of dynamic arrest , in which the large particles are first arrested while the other species continues to diffuse , followed by a second transition at a higher total volume fraction in which the smaller particles are finally localized inside the pores of the matrix formed by the previously arrested particles .",
    "thus , there must be a threshold asymmetry @xmath143 beyond which this might occur .",
    "one also expects , however , that even in the regime of considerable size disparities but for conditions corresponding to a few large particles in a see of smaller ones , the only mode of dynamic arrest continues to be the mode of simultaneous dynamic arrest of the two species , since in this case the arrest of the small particles implies the arrest of the few large ones .",
    "we call this the _  chancaquilla \" _ limit @xcite , in reference to one of the many names of a rather universal sweet prepared by the vitrification of liquid molasses in which nuts or raisins are previously dispersed .",
    "clearly , the dynamic arrest of the supporting molasses implies the arrest of the nuts dispersed in it .",
    "hence , for large size asymmetries we expect to find both modes of dynamic arrest located in the neighborhood of the opposite composition limits , @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "in fact , this is exactly the scenario predicted by our theory .",
    "we illustrate this with the scgle results obtained using the percus - yevick @xcite structure factors as the static input , for a size asymmetry @xmath146 .",
    "let us calculate the collective and self propagator matrices @xmath49 and @xmath50 at increasing total volume fractions @xmath147 starting in the ergodic regime , crossing the dynamic arrest transition line , and ending inside the regime of arrested states .",
    "if this is done in the neighborhood of the @xmath145 axis , say for @xmath148 , the scenario would be essentially that described by the _ chancaquilla _",
    "mechanism involving the simultaneous dynamic arrest of both species , with similar results to those discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] for the yukawa mixture .",
    "the other mode of dynamic arrest is observed in the opposite regime , where the small particles are a minority , exemplified by the molar fraction @xmath149 .",
    "this case is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] , which presents the evolution of the relaxation of the diagonal elements of the collective and self propagator matrices @xmath49 and @xmath50 as we increase the total volume fraction @xmath147 at fixed molar fraction @xmath149 , starting in the ergodic regime .",
    "we find that , rather than passing directly from the fully ergodic region to the region of fully arrested states , as in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] , one first passes through an intermediate region of hybrid states , in which only the big particles are arrested but the small particles continue to diffuse .",
    "thus , at a volume fraction @xmath150 , the system passes from the fully ergodic region to the region @xmath151 of hybrid states , with @xmath152 being the location of the second transition consisting of the localization of the small particles in the pores of the random matrix of big particles . in the present example",
    "this occurs at @xmath153 .",
    "let us mention that in all these cases one observes that the diagonal collective diffusion propagator @xmath122 behave in qualitatively identical manner to the corresponding self diffusion propagator @xmath154 in the sense that either both relax to zero or both exhibit dynamic arrest ( i.e. , decay to a finite value ) .",
    "one does not encounter a situation in which , for example,@xmath155 decays to a finite value while @xmath156 decays to zero .",
    "this indicates that at the level of the diagonal propagators , self and collective diffusion provide consistent descriptions of the pattern of relaxation .",
    "thus , we may identify the fully ergodic states by the fact that all the elements of the ( self and collective ) propagators decay to zero , whereas the fully non - ergodic states can be identified by the decay of _ all _ the propagators to finite asymptotic values ( identified with the non - ergodic parameters @xmath157 and @xmath158 ) .",
    "the results for @xmath159 in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] are representative of fully ergodic states , whereas those for @xmath160 illustrate fully arrested states .",
    "hybrid states are characterized by a mixed behavior , in which the diagonal propagators @xmath155 and @xmath131 associated to the mobile species , decay to zero , while the diagonal propagators @xmath161 and @xmath132 , associated to the large particles , exhibit arrested behavior .",
    "these conditions are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] by the results corresponding to @xmath162 .",
    "the relaxation of the crossed collective propagators @xmath163 and @xmath164 , not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] , do deserve some discussion , particularly in connection with mixed states .",
    "first , one must have in mind that , although the matrices @xmath22 and @xmath165 are symmetric , their product @xmath166 in general is not ; thus , in general , @xmath167 .",
    "second , since the initial value @xmath168 of the propagator matrix is the unit matrix , the initial value of the off - diagonal collective propagators @xmath163 and @xmath164 must vanish .",
    "third , the off - diagonal collective propagators are not necessarily positive .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.3p ] , which exhibits the time - relaxation of the four collective propagators @xmath169 for the same mixed state included in fig .",

    "we observe that both , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , are negative , and that @xmath163 relaxes to a finite non - ergodic asymptotic value , while @xmath164 is always much smaller and relaxes to zero .",

    "since @xmath164 is small and relaxes to zero , we find that the collective correlator @xmath176 is virtually identical to the collective propagator @xmath161 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.3p ] .",
    "in contrast , although the propagator @xmath155 does decay to zero , the diagonal collective correlator @xmath177 exhibits dynamic arrest due to its linear dependence on @xmath163 which , as illustrated in the figure , relaxes to a non - zero value .",
    "this observation may be relevant when describing the hybrid states above .",
    "for example , the description in terms of correlators has been employed in recent work @xcite , where the situation illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.3p ] arises , leading to the notion that collective diffusion in mixtures is intrinsically different from self - diffusion .",
    "our results indicate , however , that this apparent difference is just the result of the normalization convention employed in the definition of the correlators , and that if the same information were displayed in terms of the elements of the propagator matrices , no mixing of relaxation modes would occur that suggest this notion .",
    "we should stress that the _ self _ correlators , defined as @xmath178 , are identical to the self propagators @xmath179 , and hence correctly describe the fact that only the small particles diffuse and the large particles are arrested .",
    "finally , let us mention that distinguishing the three dynamic states above ( fully ergodic , fully non - ergodic , and hybrid states ) with only the information of the type in figs .",
    "[ fig.3 ] and [ fig.3p ] is not a simple matter .",
    "the reason is that the non - ergodic parameters of the propagators associated with the localization of the small spheres do not jump discontinuously from zero to a finite appreciable value at @xmath152 .",
    "instead , they increase continuously from a value of zero right at this transition , and hence , attain finite but very small values in the close neighborhood of the transition .",
    "in the following section , however , we shall derive a simpler procedure to precisely locate these transitions and to evaluate the non - ergodic parameters in the ( partially or totally ) arrested states .",
    "with the information just presented , one may choose to analyze the detailed time - dependence of the propagators , and discuss the various regimes of the relaxation processes described by these functions at specific points in the state space .",
    "alternatively , one can discuss more global properties , such as the general topology of the ergodic - nonergodic phase diagram of the system , just like one does in equilibrium statistical thermodynamics .",
    "in fact , the ergodic - nonergodic phase diagram should be an important complement to conventional equilibrium phase diagrams in terms of practical applications .",

    "the reason for this expectation is that this regime must contain the extreme case corresponding to the degenerate limit @xmath216 . from the point of view of their interactions , in this limit the particles of both species are actually indistinguishable ( @xmath217 ) , thus being in fact a mono - disperse system , whose particles have been classified only artificially as belonging to either of these two species . we expect , then , that for any molar fraction @xmath218 , the system will be arrested at the total volume fraction @xmath219 at which a mono - disperse system would be arrested .",

    "we identified and illustrated the two possible patterns of dynamic arrest in a binary colloidal mixture , namely , the simultaneous and the sequential arrest of the two species .",

    "[ fig.3 ] , here the system may be driven from the region of fully ergodic states ( @xmath246 ) to the region of mixed states ( finite @xmath211 and @xmath247 ) in which the large particles are arrested and the small ones diffuse through the voids left by the large species . in this transition",
    "@xmath211 jumps discontinuously from its infinite value in the fully non - ergodic region to a finite value in the region of mixed states , whereas @xmath210 retains its infinite value .",
    "finally , there is a transition from this region of mixed states to the region of fully ergodic states in which also the small particles are localized ( finite values of both , @xmath210 and @xmath211 ) .",
    "this latter transition is characterized by a continuous change in the values of both order parameters @xmath210 and @xmath211 , although the latter changes continuously from its infinite value inside the region of mixed states and right at the transition , to finite values inside the fully non - ergodic region .    locating the transitions just described",
    "may be done by numerically solving the full self - consistent system of equation , as done in figs .",
    "[ fig.2 ] and [ fig.3 ] , or by directly determining the non - ergodic parameters , which play the role of order parameters of the transition .",

    "we must say that some of the features of the scgle results thus determined were in fact discovered and discussed in the pioneering work of refs .",

    "the main contribution of the present work is the proposal of a new theoretical approach that allows the determination of the entire dynamic phase diagram of simple model colloidal mixtures .",
    "thus , the second important contribution involves the simplest of such models , namely , the hard - sphere binary mixture , for which we outlined the entire dynamic arrest phase diagram . in this context",
    "we discussed the regime of mild size asymmetries , in which we reported the first apparent difference with the results of mct , namely , the fact that the scgle theory does not predict the s - shaped transitions predicted by gtze and voigtmann @xcite on the basis of mct . for more severe size disparities we also illustrated the main features of the scgle predictions , including the precise location of the region of mixed states , and its emergence for size disparities beyond a threshold asymmetry @xmath248 .",
    "these results do not have yet a mct counterpart to compare with .",
    "in this paper we also discussed the fact that other properties besides @xmath210 and @xmath211 could be employed as order parameters to classify the various dynamic phases in a mixture .",
    "for example , one can use the diagonal elements of the non - ergodic parameters associated with the self or the collective propagator matrices , which also determine unambiguously the various possible states .",
    "although not central to the main subject of this paper , we also explained that the use as order parameters of collective _ correlators _ , defined as the partial intermediate scattering functions divided by their initial value , may lead to a confusing description of the hybrid states in which one species is arrested and the other remains ergodic .    in summary , we have presented a theory for dynamic arrest phenomena in colloidal mixtures that offers some advantages over the extension to mixtures of conventional mct .",
    "first , it derives from a simpler conceptual formalism , which might allow possible generalizations and extensions .",
    "second , the resulting equations are much simpler to solve in practice than the corresponding equations of mct .",
    "in fact , the determination of ( ergodic  non - ergodic ) phase diagrams , such as that discussed in the previous section , is considerably simplified in the present case through the use of the results for the non - ergodic parameters @xmath201 in eq .",

    "thus , many important issues regarding the dynamics and the ( ergodic  non - ergodic ) phase behavior of colloidal mixtures may be discussed with the assistance of the scgle theory just presented .",
