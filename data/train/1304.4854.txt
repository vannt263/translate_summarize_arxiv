    "real - life networks are of finite size , loopy and display heavy correlations .",
    "this complexity represents a challenge from several points of view : first it is computationally expensive when attempting to investigate the network topology and to simulate dynamical systems upon it ; moreover it becomes rapidly intractable analytically and one is obliged to make assumptions in order to simplify the picture and perform calculations .",
    "if this effort is crucial to practically afford problems , it also embeds a deeper question : facing the network complexity and their omnipresence in real world , it is fundamental to make the distinction between the essential variables which are able to catch the topology main features and those details which are unessential for a minimal though complete description .",
    "one of those very fruitful simplifications is _ sparseness _ , i.e. the networks considered have in general a few links per vertex while the network size tends to infinity .",
    "more precisely , a network is _ sparse _ if @xmath12 when @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the average degree .",
    "this basic hypothesis leads to a crucial consequence : locally , the network can be approximated by a tree , which means the absence of _ finite loops , _ i.e. finite closed paths , among the vertices .",
    "sparseness and the local tree - likeness proved essential to analytical studies of dynamical systems on networks : we cite , focusing just on small - world networks , studies on the ising model @xcite , percolation @xcite and , more recently , on the kuramoto model ( for a more complete overview , see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the advantage in terms of numerical computation is evident : in general , both numerical studies investigating the network topology @xcite and critical phenomena on networks @xcite exploit the assumption of sparseness in its strongest form , taking the degree as constant .",
    "nevertheless , increasing the links density , networks exist which are still sparse , fulfilling the aforementioned condition but they can not no longer ensure the tree - likeness because of the heavy presence of loops .",
    "it could be argued hence that the links density could play a non negligible role both on the topological properties of those networks and on dynamical models defined upon them .",
    "indeed it is the case of the @xmath0-rotors model on regular one - dimensional chains : we show that the passage between a sparse network in the sense of @xmath15 and a dense one ( @xmath16 ) implies the emergence of a new metastable state for which the thermodynamic order parameter does not relax at equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the links density hence triggers a non trivial effect on the thermodynamic behavior of the @xmath0 model , which by itself is known for possessing a rich phenomenology investigated in several numerical studies @xcite on 2 and 3-d lattices .",
    "in particular , we would like to recall , as an example among many others , that the two dimensional case with nearest neighbors coupling is characterized by the famous berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless phase transition @xcite , which implies the correlation function to switch from a power law decay at low temperatures to an exponential one in the high temperatures regime . in the mean field limit , the @xmath0 model , called the hamiltonian mean field ( hfm ) model in this case , displays as well a wide variety of behaviors this complexity being strongly entangled with the lack of additivity . among its peculiarities we cite the presence of a second order phase transition of the magnetization @xcite and , even more noteworthy , the presence of non equilibrium quasi - stationary states of diverging duration in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "more recently , those models have been challenged to face more complex network topologies : for instance , studies exist concerning the hmf model on random graphs @xcite where , varying the links density , a second order phase transition of the global magnetization is recovered for every density value in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "furthermore , studies of the @xmath0 model on small world networks @xcite proved that this lattice topology supports as well complex thermodynamical responses of the model : a mean field transition of the order parameter is retrieved and its critical energy seems to depend on the network parameters . +",
    "the present work inscribes itself on this line as we will focus , on first instance , on regular networks and then we will shuffle this regular topology with the introduction of a controlled amount of randomness . the first part of the paper being on regular networks , we detail the analytical calculations presented in @xcite showing that tuning the link density allows to pass from a short - range regime to a long - range one .",
    "the analytical approach is preceded in sec .",
    "[ sec : thermodynamic - behaviour regular ] by the results of numerical simulations which are as well more extensively illustrated than in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we show that it exists between those two regimes a peculiar metastable state characterized by huge fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "we then address , in the second part of the paper , small - world networks using the watts - strogatz model @xcite aiming to shed light on the interplay between the link density and the injection of randomness in the network . in his regime",
    "we first investigate , acting on the links density @xmath7 and on the rewiring probability @xmath10 , the crossover from the regular lattice to the small - network topology . in sec.[sec : thermodynamic - behaviour ] we consider the dynamics of the @xmath0-rotors model on small - world networks and we show how the emergence of global coherence , via a mean field phase transition of the order parameter , strongly depends on the topological conditions fixed by @xmath10 and @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , we discuss in the last part how this influence turns out to be _ quantitative _ , affecting the critical energy @xmath9 at which the phase transition occurs .",
    "the @xmath0-rotors model describes a set of @xmath17 spins interacting pairwise : each spin is fixed on the sites of a one dimensional ring and it is assigned with two canonically conjugated variables @xmath18 , @xmath19 $ ] being a rotation angle .",
    "the @xmath0 hamiltonian reads @xcite : @xmath20 + where @xmath21 is the matrix encoding the spins connections : @xmath22 we take @xmath23 , so that we are in the ferromagnetic case and in the following @xmath24 as well as the lattice spacing .",
    "finally the @xmath25 factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential hmf ] ) ensures that the energy is an extensive quantity .",
    "@xmath14 is referred to as the _ degree _ and , to control the density of links in the network , we define it as : @xmath26 practically , we take the integer part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : degree ] ) since , once fixed @xmath7 and @xmath17 , @xmath14 is in general non integer .",
    "since we assign @xmath14 links per spin and we set periodic boundary conditions , the system is translationally invariant .",
    "the dynamics are given by the set of hamilton equations : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , represents the neighbors of rotor @xmath29 .",
    "a global parameter , the magnetization is defined by @xmath30 in order to have an insight on the macroscopic behavior : we expect finite values of @xmath31 to indicate the emergence of a coherent inhomogeneous state , while a vanishing magnetization signals the absence of long - range order .",
    "we first study the response of the total equilibrium magnetization @xmath31 to the change of the underlying network via the @xmath7 parameter .",
    "practically , for each @xmath7 , we perform simulations within the microcanonical ensemble , by direct numerical integration of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eq dynamics ] ) with the fifth order optimal symplectic integrator described in @xcite . the initial conditions of angles and momenta are picked from a gaussian distributions with identical variance ( which corresponds to a low temperature setting ) and , to check the numerical integration , we monitor the conservation of the two constants of motion preserved by the dynamics : the energy @xmath32 and the total angular momentum @xmath33 , which we have set without loss of generality to @xmath34 .",
    "finally the time step is @xmath35 and we average the thermodynamic quantities over time only when the system has reached the equilibrium .",
    "the regular network that we take into account is a one - dimensional chain of @xmath17 spins ( rotors ) with periodic boundary conditions for which each spin is connected to its @xmath14 nearest neighbors . by tuning the parameter @xmath7 , @xmath36 we act on the links density of the network . for @xmath37",
    "the spins are connected to their nearest neighbors , while for @xmath38 the network is fully coupled .",
    "heuristically , changing the value of @xmath7 corresponds to change the _ range _ of interaction of each spin .",
    "then two limit behaviors naturally emerge from this approach : the first is @xmath391 in which we expect the system to behave progressively like a one dimensional short range system with the existence of a continuous symmetry group , and so without any phase transition . on the other side",
    ", the @xmath40 limit leads to the mean field regime and we expect the hmf transition of the magnetization to appear above a specific threshold of degree .",
    "we find this boundary value for @xmath41 so that the two aforementioned limits translate more precisely in two intervals @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "practically , for each @xmath7 value , we monitor the average magnetization @xmath42 ( the bar indicates the temporal mean ) for different sizes @xmath17 and for every energy density @xmath43 in the physical range .",
    "the temporal mean is computed on the second half on the simulations : we start with the gaussian initial conditions described in sec . [",
    "sec : the - xy - rotors - model ] and we simulate the dynamics , calculating the magnetization at each time step .",
    "when the system reaches a stationary state for the magnetization , we take the temporal mean as the equilibrium value .",
    "we start our analysis with the @xmath3 interval .",
    "the simulations are displayed    ( a)(a ) equilibrium magnetization versus energy density for @xmath44 and different sizes .",
    "the error bars are of the size of the dots ; ( b ) residual magnetization for @xmath44 at @xmath45 versus the system size.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] + ( b)(a ) equilibrium magnetization versus energy density for @xmath44 and different sizes .",
    "the error bars are of the size of the dots ; ( b ) residual magnetization for @xmath44 at @xmath45 versus the system size.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    in figs .",
    "[ fig : low gamma]a - b and as mentioned the magnetization smoothly vanishes with the energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : low gamma]a ) .",
    "we have to recall that for low energies , the magnetization can be non - zero as a finite size effect , so the results displayed should depend on the system size .",
    "this is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig : low gamma ] , where the trend for the magnetization to vanish with increasing the size is exhibited . to check with even larger sizes , we consider in fig .",
    "[ fig : low gamma]b the magnetization for a small energy density @xmath45 and several sizes .",
    "the results clearly point out that the magnetization vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "when looking at relaxation scales , we found that larger sizes took more time to relax to equilibrium .",
    "so typically in our simulations we take as final time @xmath46 for sizes up to @xmath47 and for @xmath48  @xmath49 .",
    "given these numerical results , we conclude that in the @xmath3 interval , the system is short - ranged and the mermin - wagner theorem applies imposing the order parameter to vanish .",
    "nevertheless , if long - range order is not possible , quasi long - range could still entail an infinite order phase transition of the correlation function , like in the two dimensional @xmath0 model with nearest neighbors interactions .",
    "we recall that this particular type of critical phenomenon , first detected by berezinskii , kosterlitz and thouless @xcite , is characterized by two different types of decay of the correlation function with distance : a power law or an exponential decay , respectively for low and high temperatures . in order to look for such possibility we computed the correlation function @xmath50})\\:,\\ ] ] for every @xmath51 in the considered range .",
    "the results shown in fig . [ fig : correlations 1.25 ]     for @xmath44 and @xmath52.[fig : correlations 1.25],width=302 ]    indicate that the decay behavior is also exponential for low energies , demonstrating the absence of the aforementioned phase transition .",
    "this could have been anticipated from the fact that finite size effects on the magnetization even though present were small , but possible tricky effects of the boundary conditions could come into play , so it was worthwhile checking .    to summarize our result ,",
    "we can conclude that , for @xmath3 , the spin degree is still too low for the system to show long - range or quasi long - range .",
    "interestingly , the short range behavior is still at play even for configurations like @xmath53 where each spin is under the influence of quite an important neighborhood since @xmath54 in this case .",
    "taking now in account the symmetric interval @xmath4 , the spins are connected enough to allow a coherent state to emerge : in fig . [ fig : various gamma ]     and different @xmath7 .",
    "for @xmath55 the error bars are of the size of the dots . [",
    "fig : various gamma],width=302 ]    the magnetization undergoes a second order phase transition at @xmath56 which is well described by the hmf analytical curve .",
    "again , around the delicate zone of the phase transition , finite size effects induce a shift between the theoretical prediction of the hmf and the simulations , but they can be smoothed down increasing the size .",
    "we recall that this phenomenon is also present for the full coupling @xmath57 . as a consequence",
    "we then find that even with a degree remarkably inferior ( e.g. for @xmath58 ) than the full coupling condition , each spin possesses enough connections to trigger the global behavior of the system and give a finite magnetization ( at low energies ) .",
    "of course , in both the intervals @xmath59 , the equilibrium magnetization is still affected by fluctuations because of the finite size effects . to monitor these we measured the magnetization variance @xmath60 and we show in fig .  [ fig : variance 1.5 ] that it scales with the system size like @xmath61",

    "( [ eq : scaling sigma ] ) and coherent with in the @xmath75 regimes , is substituted by a flat behavior increasing @xmath17 ( see the results in fig .  [",

    "it is worth noticing that the influence the system size can be retrieved not in the fluctuations amplitude but in the typical fluctuation time scale . in figs .",
    "[ fig : fluctuations]c - d , it becomes obvious that fluctuations appear to slow down with the system size .",
    "this time - scale dependence on the size is reminiscent of out of equilibrium behavior in systems with long range interactions , namely the lifetime of the quasi stationary states ( qss ) @xcite and further investigations are ongoing to shed light on this effect and on its potential analogy with the hmf results .",
    "heuristically , for @xmath64 it is like the if each spin does not possess enough connections to create a global order and establish the mean field but , nevertheless , the degree is sufficiently high ( @xmath41 corresponds to @xmath76 ) to avoid the vanishing of the order parameter in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the resulting behavior is reminiscent of a bistable regime oscillating between the @xmath77 configuration and the mean field value , which corresponds to a finite magnetization , we thus may expect some kind of intermittent behavior . in fine , the flatness of the variance suggests moreover that we observe a state with infinite susceptibility @xmath78 considering its canonical definition @xmath79 to conclude our analysis in symmetry with the @xmath59 cases , we looked for a signature of this non trivial state in the correlation function but the fluctuations heavily affect it too so that it oscillates without showing a proper scaling .",
    "the numerical investigations illustrated point out that the degree triggers the shift from the pure one dimensional topology to the mean field frame .",
    "we now tackle this issue analytically aiming to retrieve the influence of the topology , encoded in the adjacency matrix @xmath21 ( eq .  ( [ eq : adiacency matrix ] ) ) , in the thermodynamic properties .",
    "we thus compute the magnetization in the low energy regime and check if the correct behavior is recovered , namely a zero magnetization for @xmath3 and a finite value for @xmath4 . at low energies we have a clear separation between the magnetization values , with @xmath77 and the mean field one , in which as @xmath80 . in this limit , due to the ferromagnetic coupling it is natural to assume the differences @xmath81 are small when @xmath82 so that the connected spins are mostly aligned in order to minimize the free energy .",
    "we can hence develop the hamiltonian at the leading order : @xmath83 so that our system reduces to a collection of oscillators connected by @xmath21 .",
    "we then choose to represent the spin field as a superposition of modes , following the recipe given in refs @xcite : @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : representation ] ) , we sum over @xmath17 modes so that the change of variables is linear and we observe that , given the periodic boundary conditions , it just corresponds to perform a discrete fourier transform .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath85 are , in our approach , the information carriers of the temporal behavior , hence the representation of the momenta @xmath86 is related to the one of the angles via the first hamilton equation @xmath87 .",
    "the phases @xmath88 are randomly distributed on the circle to ensure that the momenta @xmath86 are gaussian distributed in the limit @xmath13 as theoretically predicted for the microcanonical ensemble . following the approach described in @xcite ,",
    "if we consider different sets of phases @xmath89 labeled by @xmath90 we can interpret each set as a realization of the system , i.e. a trajectory in the phase space .",

    "regarding fig .",
    "[ fig : log dependence]b , we do not expect the results to be valid near @xmath41 .",
    "indeed a precise estimation of @xmath11 proves to be very delicate since it relies in its turn on the determination of the critical energy of the transition which is intrinsically a hard task .",
    "moreover the simulations are performed with finite size systems , so the measured @xmath11 is influenced by finite size effects .",
    "then we actually have @xmath179 and this dependence on @xmath17 can entail a finite value even for @xmath41 .",
    "we also have to mention that we average on a finite number of network realizations , which may affect as well the results .",
    "an interesting path to follow in order to avoid this effects and refine our estimations could be the use of finite - size scaling techniques .",
    "moreover , since previous results exist in the canonical ensemble @xcite , this analysis would be of interest in our approach because we deal with the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "it would then be possible to compare the characteristics of the phase transition in the two ensembles and shed light on their equivalence .",
    "proceeding in our analysis , we recall that for the regular network a metastable state was found for @xmath63 in which the order parameter is affected by heavy fluctuations , suggesting that the system oscillates between low magnetization values , proper of the @xmath3 regime , and the mean field value of the @xmath4 case .",
    "we can notice that , after the introduction of randomness , we do not observe this metastable state for @xmath41 or any other value of @xmath7 .",
    "in fact now a small ( eventually vanishing ) @xmath10 is enough to generate a phase transition .",
    "it therefore exists an interplay between the `` quantitative '' parameter @xmath7 and the `` qualitative '' parameter @xmath10 ; nevertheless those parameters , as anticipated in sec .",
    "[ sec : the - model ] , are not equivalent when dealing with their influence on the thermodynamic behavior of the @xmath0-model .",
    "this duality is so far not complete since it was not possible to retrieve the metastable state in the @xmath3 regime acting exclusively on the @xmath10 parameter . in this sense ,",
    "the randomness is `` regularizing '' the thermodynamic behavior : the rewired network supports either the behavior of a regular lattice either , once the small - world regime is reached , gives rise to the phase transition of the magnetization .",
    "summarizing , we can say that the noise created by the rewiring stabilizes the passage between the two regimes and destroys the delicate metastable state which arose in the regular lattice .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the influence on the critical behavior of the @xmath0-rotors model of two different network topologies , the regular lattice and small world network . in sec .  [",
    "sec : thermodynamic - behaviour regular ] , we introduced the parameter @xmath7 which allows to tune the number of links from the linear chain to the full coupling configuration .",
    "we identified two main parameter regions : the first for @xmath3 in which the model has a one dimensional behavior and thus it does not display long - range or quasi long - range order as shown by numerical simulations . on the contrary , in the second region @xmath180 , the spin degree is sufficiently high to lead to the emergence of a coherent state : we thus observe a mean field phase transition of the magnetization , identical to the one of the hmf model .",
    "more interestingly , we show numerical and analytical evidence of an unstable state at the threshold between the two regions , for @xmath6 . in this peculiar state ,",
    "the magnetization is affected by fluctuations which seem to be size independent and , furthermore , this state does not reach equilibrium on the timescales considered .",
    "we then calculated analytically an approximated expression for the magnetization , obtained in the low temperatures regime , which demonstrates the topological critical nature of @xmath6 .",
    "this expression retrieves correctly the two behaviors aforementioned and , since it contains the spectrum of the adjacency matrix , it points out that the _ topological _ origin of the three different phases shown by the simulations . we have then studied the role of the links density on the topology of small - world networks and its effect on the @xmath0-rotors model dynamics .",
    "we have focused , in sec .",
    "[ sec : the - model ] , on the crossover to the small - world regime tuning the @xmath7 parameter .",
    "we show by numerical simulations that @xmath143 has the scaling in eq .",

    "hence the links density , governed by @xmath7 , turns out to be crucial to enhance the crossover between the `` large - world '' regime and the small - world one cooperating with the rewiring probability @xmath10 in the creation of long - range connections .",
