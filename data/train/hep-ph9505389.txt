    "it will be possible to directly measure the triple boson vertices ( tbv ) at future high energy @xmath7 colliders like the cern large electron positron collider ii ( lepii ) @xcite and the next linear collider ( nlc ) @xcite .",
    "these gauge boson self - couplings are a key prediction of the non - abelian @xmath8 electroweak theory and , as yet , are only loosely constrained by indirect loop contributions and measurements of the @xmath9 , and @xmath10 processes . both the d0 and cdf collaborations have now looked for @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite , and @xmath10 @xcite production in the data from the 1a run ( 1992 - 93 ) .",
    "present 95 % cl experimental limits are @xmath13 ( cdf ) and @xmath14 ( d0 ) from @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( cdf ) and @xmath17 ( d0 ) from @xmath18 .",
    "two analyses of recent cleo data @xcite on the process b@xmath19 determine consistent limits of @xmath20 @xcite and @xmath21 @xcite . while these experimental bounds are compatible with the standard model ( sm ) , they are still too weak to be considered a precision test of the theory .    the couplings of the w to the neutral gauge bosons @xmath3 and z can be described in general by an effective lagrangian with seven parameters .",
    "a standard parametrization of the vertices is @xcite @xmath22 where v represents either the photon or z field and the overall couplings are @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "of the seven coupling parameters , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 parametrize @xmath1 respecting effective lagrangian terms ; their tree - level standard model values are @xmath27    most previous work on anomalous tbv contributions has concentrated on these @xmath1-even couplings @xcite .",
    "for a recent review see @xcite . predicted detection bounds on these couplings at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and an nlc with @xmath28 center of mass energy of 500 gev or greater are at the percent level and better when a variety of processes is considered .",
    "this degree of sensitivity should be sufficient to measure the tbv at the level of standard model loop corrections @xcite and certain extensions to the sm @xcite .",
    "the couplings @xmath29 , and @xmath4 parametrize vertex contributions that violate @xmath1 invariance .",
    "since @xmath1 violation was first discovered in the neutral @xmath30 system , a satisfactory explanation of its origin has been lacking . within the @xmath8 framework of the sm",
    ", @xmath1 violation occurs via the kobayashi - maskawa phase in the ckm matrix .",
    "since the ckm matrix lies in the quark sector , a @xmath1 violating contribution to a leptonic process will appear to first order at the two - loop level in the sm ; these @xmath1-odd couplings are therefore zero at tree and one - loop level .",
    "one - loop effects are however possible in extensions to the sm ; they manifest themselves in non - zero @xmath29 , and @xmath4 of the order of 10@xmath31 or smaller due to the loop suppression @xcite .",
    "such an explicitly @xmath1 violating contribution to the ww@xmath3 vertex is strongly constrained by neutron electric dipole measurements to be less than @xmath32 @xcite ; the su(2 ) symmetry then implies that a wwz contribution should be similar in magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , because these experimental constraints on a @xmath1 violating contribution to the tbv are indirect , they are no substitute for a direct search .",
    "we have previously considered the purely leptonic processes @xmath33 with all possible charged lepton combinations in the final state as candidates for measuring the triple boson vertex .",
    "the details of that examination are given in @xcite .",
    "detection limits for the @xmath1-even couplings @xmath2 , achievable through measurement of the total cross - section at energies of 500 gev and 1 tev were there determined . at @xmath34 = 500 gev , we found @xmath35 and at @xmath34 = 1 tev , @xmath36 where the parentheses indicate which of the charged lepton combinations provide these tightest bounds .    in this paper",
    ", we extend our consideration of the processes of eq.([proc ] ) .",
    "the paper consists of two parts . in the first",
    ", we discuss means by which the above limits on the @xmath1-even couplings @xmath2 might be improved .",
    "we discuss in section [ pol ] the advantages offered by accessing the helicity information through a polarized beam facility and present in section [ even ] the improved limits achievable through the restriction of certain angular variables phase space . in the second part of the paper , we examine the potential for detection of non - standard values for the @xmath1-odd couplings @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "we present in section [ detlim ] our results for detection limits on the couplings @xmath5 and @xmath4 , derived from both total and differential cross - section analyses . in section [ asym ]",
    "we consider the possibility of asymmetries in certain @xmath1 odd variables as providing more sensitive indicators of @xmath1 violation than does the cross - section .",
    "we summarize in section [ con ] .",
    "in the energy ranges of lep and higher , in contrast with the left - right symmetric physics of the qed dominated lower energies , helicity effects are expected to be important .",
    "these polarization effects might prove useful in the measurement of the triple boson vertices ww@xmath3 and wwz .",
    "the possibility of using polarized @xmath28 beams to access the helicity information in a measurement of the tbv has been examined previously @xcite . at lepii energies ,",
    "polarized beams are not expected to provide a substantial gain in sensitivity , but might help to disentangle different anomalous contributions @xcite . at higher energies ,",
    "significantly improved limits on the couplings could be achieved with initial beam polarization @xcite .",
    "individual helicity amplitudes for a given process can differ in their dependence , both in form and magnitude , on the triple boson vertices .",
    "the contributions of different helicity amplitudes to the total cross - section can therefore provide constraints on @xmath37 and @xmath38 that are complementary to those obtained from the total cross - section .",
    "for instance , the @xmath39 channel has contributions from only the @xmath40 and @xmath41 helicity amplitudes .",
    "our convention is to list the helicities of the four charged fermions as @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath40 amplitude involves the neutrino exchange diagram of w - pair production , the @xmath41 amplitude does not .",
    "this diagram dominates the @xmath40 amplitude as well as the total cross - section but unfortunately does not contain the trilinear couplings .",
    "the neutrino exchange diagram can therefore be thought of as a @xmath43-independent `` background '' to the contributions of the triple boson vertex containing diagrams .",
    "the @xmath41 amplitude , and resulting cross - section , is free of the large @xmath43-independent contribution of this diagram , and has therefore a relatively greater sensitivity to deviations @xmath44 . without the dominant t - channel neutrino contribution however ,",
    "the cross - section @xmath45 is much smaller than that of @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , with consequently poorer statistical sensitivity .",
    "it therefore requires analysis to determine whether the improved sensitivity to @xmath44 of @xmath45 will be sufficient to counter the loss of statistics , and ultimately provide more stringent limits .    to illustrate the scale of the possible improvements in the detection limits for the deviations @xmath44",
    ", we examine the individual helicity amplitude contributions to the total cross - section for the @xmath48 channel at @xmath34 = 500 gev .",
    "the @xmath48 channel is chosen because , with only two helicity amplitudes contributing , it provides the simplest demonstration of the principle .",
    "the other final state configurations present complications due to the larger number of contributing helicity amplitudes . without the ability to measure the polarization of the final state fermions , what would actually be measured are the four different possible combinations of initial polarizations , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , some of which would be sums over separate helicity amplitudes .    as before ,",
    "we explore the sensitivity of the cross - sections to variations in @xmath37 and @xmath51 , but now also determine the percentage contribution of each helicity state to the total cross - section .",
    "we convert these percentages into effective component cross - sections , from which helicity detection limits on @xmath37 and @xmath51 can be determined . for reference ,",
    "the standard model total cross - section for the @xmath48 process at @xmath52 gev , including also the charge conjugate channel @xmath53 , is @xmath54=0.0684 pb . the individual helicity state contributions to this total are determined to be , @xmath55=0.0676 pb and @xmath56=0.0008 pb .    we show the results of the analysis in fig .",
    "1 . the concentric solid lines are the @xmath57 contours for the @xmath40 helicity state ; the `` disk '' they define is very similar to that of the total cross - section .",
    "the four parallel diagonal dotted lines are the @xmath57 contours corresponding to the @xmath41 amplitude .",
    "this distinctive form is a consequence of the cancellations that occur between the photon and z contributions to the @xmath41 amplitude for equal pairings of @xmath37 and @xmath51 .",
    "the sm feynman rules for the couplings of @xmath3 and z to massive leptons , plus the different coupling strengths of the two triple boson vertices @xmath3ww and zww , ensure that the @xmath58-dependence of the @xmath41 amplitude can be schematically written as @xmath59    thus , for equal values of non - standard @xmath37 and @xmath51 and @xmath60 , the different contributions of the photon and z bosons will nearly cancel .",
    "neither the @xmath40 disk region or the @xmath41 bands independently offer significantly tighter constraints on @xmath37 and @xmath51 than did the unpolarized cross - section ; the intersection of the former with the latter does however severely restrict the allowed domain .",
    "what had been a relatively large set of @xmath61 pairings statistically indistinguishable from the standard model prediction is reduced to a significantly smaller union of two separate regions .",
    "polarization measurements could therefore , in the specific case of the @xmath48 final state , provide significantly tighter constraints on @xmath37 and @xmath51 than would the unpolarized cross - section .",
    "for instance , if we vary the couplings individually , keeping the other at its sm value , we determine limits @xmath62 which are a significant improvement on the bounds achievable from the unpolarized analysis .    for large center - of - mass energies , the cancellation between the photon and z terms when @xmath63 results in a @xmath41 helicity amplitude contribution of less than about @xmath64 of the total cross - section .",
    "when @xmath65 however , this amplitude can contribute a much larger portion of the total , the above cancellation being destroyed .",
    "a small percentage contribution of @xmath41 to the total cross - section is therefore characteristic of equal values for @xmath37 and @xmath51 and thus provides a characteristic `` signature '' of such pairings .",
    "more than merely helping to distinguish between the cases of equal or unequal @xmath37 and @xmath51 , the relative contribution of the @xmath41 amplitude could potentially serve as a characteristic `` fingerprint '' of a particular region of the @xmath61 grid .",
    "a measurement of a non - standard cross - section can , in general , be attributed to any of an infinite set of pairings of @xmath37 and @xmath51 , these points lying on a contour of constant cross - section . although indistinguishable by a simple measurement of total cross - section , these pairings will , in general , have very different characteristic helicity contributions .",
    "thus , once a cross - section measurement had indicated a non - standard @xmath61 pairing , the relative contributions of the helicity amplitudes to the total cross - section could differentiate between the sets of possible pairings responsible .",
    "similar analyses were performed for the other final state lepton pairings .",
    "the bounds from the other helicity amplitudes that contribute to these more complicated processes were generally seen to be too loose to provide any further constraint on the couplings .      in this section",
    ", we examine the results of making various phase space cuts .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "2 the distributions for the angular variable @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 is the angle between the outgoing lepton and the incoming positron ) for the @xmath68 process at @xmath52 gev .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the standard model values , the dashed line to @xmath69 , and the dotted line to @xmath70 .",
    "the strong peak in the distribution at @xmath71 is a consequence of the t - channel neutrino exchange diagram of w pair production .",
    "this behaviour is repeated for the three other processes with different final state lepton configurations , but is less marked . there , the many extra diagrams beyond w pair production dilute the effect of the t - channel neutrino diagram .    for non - standard pairings of @xmath37 and @xmath51 ,",
    "these angular distributions are generally somewhat enhanced in the regions of phase space away from this peak .",
    "since the t - channel neutrino exchange diagram does not contain the triple boson vertex , the peak is relatively insensitive to the vertex couplings .",
    "this localization of the @xmath58 sensitivity to the `` non - peak '' regions of the @xmath72 phase space suggests the potential for maximizing the @xmath58 sensitivity by cutting on these variables to exclude the large non - sensitive peak contributions , and isolate the @xmath58 dependent plateau regions .",
    "because , by making such a cut , we lose a significant portion of our total cross - section , we must distinguish between improving the _ physical _ sensitivity , as a percentage deviation from the sm total cross - section , and the _ experimental _ sensitivity , defined as the potential for detection of anomalous couplings .",
    "the angular variables are not unique in their localization of sensitivity to @xmath43 .",
    "another potential observable is @xmath73 , the invariant mass of the outgoing charged lepton - antilepton pair .",
    "the sensitivity to non - standard @xmath2 is located predominantly in the middle region of the @xmath74 distribution for the @xmath48 process at @xmath52 gev .",
    "a cut such as 30 gev @xmath75 gev would exclude the @xmath58-insensitive contributions from the extreme low and high invariant mass regions of phase space .",
    "we can therefore consider making combined cuts , both an angular and invariant mass cut , in hopes of improving sensitivity .    to simplify matters",
    ", we restrict our study to the case @xmath76 . any limits derived with the angular cuts in place ,",
    "although more constraining than those obtained by making no assumptions about the relationship between @xmath77 and @xmath38 , will still demonstrate the scale of the improvements in sensitivity possible .",
    "in table i , for the @xmath78 channel at @xmath79 gev , we show the @xmath80 limits achievable for different combinations of angular and invariant mass cuts .",
    "experimental beam - pipe detection limitations motivated our `` weak '' angular cut of @xmath81 ; this cut itself removes a significant portion of the peak region of phase space . a `` strong '' cut @xmath82 was chosen so as to minimize the contribution of the non - sensitive peak , whilst maximizing the total cross - section .",
    "the choices of @xmath83 and @xmath84 were taken as representing the extremes of optimizing the two opposing requirements , @xmath84 maximizes statistics and @xmath83 excludes essentially all of the peak contribution .",
    "we see that making a cut on the variables can significantly improve the limits for @xmath85 , but has little effect for @xmath86 .",
    "also , the most restrictive combined cut of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , despite a sizable decrease in cross - section , gives the tightest constraint on @xmath85 ( but not for @xmath89 .",
    "it seems that the improvement in physical sensitivity more than compensates for the loss of statistics .",
    "the other channels , @xmath90 , and @xmath7 , because of the extra complexity due to the additional diagrams , do not as cleanly provide the possibility of sensitivity enhancing cuts .",
    "the additional @xmath2 dependent diagrams can contribute to the very regions of phase space that we previously considered excluding ; a cut to exclude these regions of phase space can therefore be counter productive , with consequently no significant improvement in achievable coupling limits .",
    "the bounds quoted in table i are for a center of mass energy of 500 gev .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath91 is generally more evenly distributed over the available phase space at the higher energy of 1 tev .",
    "although the effect of the neutrino propagator is enhanced at higher energies , the contribution of this diagram becomes less significant as @xmath92 .",
    "there is therefore less motivation for excluding these angular regions to improve the limits on the @xmath58 couplings .",
    "we now extend our investigation to consider @xmath1-odd couplings . the @xmath1 violating form factors @xmath93 , and @xmath94",
    "can , depending on the model and the kinematics , have both real and imaginary parts .",
    "the effects of the two different possibilities can be separated by examining the consequences of the @xmath95 theorem and the unitarity condition .",
    "the @xmath95 theorem postulates the invariance @xmath96 where @xmath97 represents the state @xmath98 transformed by @xmath95 .",
    "it is very difficult to directly check this symmetry because it requires the interchange of initial and final states .",
    "it is more convenient to define a pseudo time reversal transformation , @xmath99 , that transforms the kinematic observables of the initial and final state , as does @xmath100 , but does not interchange the initial and final states .    in the born approximation , unitarity of the s - matrix",
    "implies that the transition matrix , @xmath101 , is hermitian .",
    "thus , in the born approximation @xmath101 satisfies @xmath102 and so , with a hermitian transition matrix , the @xmath95 theorem reduces to @xmath103 the @xmath95 theorem therefore provides a check on the hermiticity of the transition matrix @xmath101 .",
    "non - hermiticity of @xmath101 , which is due to contributions beyond born in which intermediate states can be on - shell , will manifest itself in violations of @xmath104 .",
    "we approximate our full four lepton production processes by w pair production for the purpose of discussion .",
    "if we define @xmath105 as the tree level sm contribution to the transition matrix ( with basis ( -,0,+ ) , the helicities of the w s ) and @xmath106 as the deviation due to the @xmath1 violating couplings , @xmath106 can be compactly expressed as @xcite @xmath107\\ ] ] the coefficients in the above are @xmath108 and @xmath109 .    under the @xmath104 transformation",
    ", we must have @xmath110 which requires @xmath93 , and @xmath94 to be real .",
    "an imaginary component of the coupling parameters will break the @xmath104 symmetry , and so parametrizes the non - hermiticity of the transition matrix , the hallmark of beyond born final state interactions .",
    "such effects are small in a weakly coupled theory such as the sm , and so in what follows we concentrate on the case where all form factors are real .",
    "of the three @xmath1-odd couplings , @xmath111 and @xmath94 are @xmath112-even and @xmath113-odd , @xmath114 is @xmath113-even and @xmath112-odd .",
    "thus a non - zero @xmath115 is forbidden by electromagnetic gauge invariance . with @xmath116 , the existence of a non - zero @xmath117",
    "would imply that the w boson interactions intrinsically violate the su(2 ) weak - isospin symmetry .",
    "there is , however , good empirical evidence for the validity of this symmetry .",
    "accordingly , we assume also that @xmath118 and restrict ourselves to the couplings @xmath119 , and @xmath120 in the following sections . also , in the analysis of these @xmath1-odd couplings , we restrict the @xmath1-even couplings to their sm values , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "we determine detection limits on @xmath5 and @xmath4 at two center - of - mass energies , 500 gev and 1 tev .",
    "for each of the four different types of four lepton channels , at each of the two energies , we fit parabolas to the dependence of the total cross - section on each of the couplings @xmath123 , and @xmath120 .",
    "the standard model cross - section @xmath54 , multiplied by our assumed integrated luminosity of 50 fb@xmath124 , determines the expected number of events n , about which we assume a normal distribution . the detection limits , representing the magnitude of anomalous coupling required to give a @xmath80 deviation in the number of events , are listed below in tables ii and iii .",
    "the constraints on @xmath5 from table ii are quite loose compared to the predicted bounds on the @xmath1-even @xmath2 .",
    "the limits on @xmath2 approach the few percent level at the higher energy of @xmath125 tev .",
    "the difference in sensitivity between the @xmath1-even and @xmath1-odd couplings can be attributed in part to the relative phase between the @xmath1-odd and sm contributions .",
    "this phase difference ensures that interference between the two is minimal ; thus the @xmath1-odd couplings contribute predominantly to first order quadratically , whereas the contributions of the non - standard @xmath1-even couplings can interfere with the standard model amplitude .",
    "the @xmath4 terms also contribute to first order dominantly quadratically ; they however have a much better high energy behaviour .",
    "they rise with energy like @xmath126 , and not @xmath34 , as do the @xmath111 terms .",
    "the limits on @xmath4 , as listed in table iii , are consequently much tighter than those for @xmath5 , table ii . indeed ,",
    "some of the limits on @xmath4 from the different channels are of the same scale as predicted for these couplings by the various `` beyond - standard '' models @xcite , specifically , those from the @xmath48 process at 1 tev .",
    "also , they approach the level of precision predicted necessary by neutron electric dipole moment measurements .",
    "of course , these limits for @xmath4 are dependent on the choice of the scaling parameter for the @xmath4 term in eq .",
    "[ lag ] ( we chose @xmath127 ) . a choice of @xmath128 tev , reflecting the scale of possible `` new '' physics , sometimes suggested as being more appropriate , would weaken the bounds on @xmath4 by 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "the sensitivity to the @xmath1-odd couplings shows the same phase space localization as was demonstrated for the @xmath1-even couplings , with the regions of least sensitivity contributing a large portion of the total cross - section . we can account for both the high and low sensitivity regions , and do so in a manner which optimizes both statistics and sensitivity , through a @xmath130 @xcite or maximum likelihood analysis @xcite .",
    "we present briefly the basic principles of the two analyses and the scale of the limits achievable with them .    to demonstrate the principle of the @xmath130 analysis , we consider a distribution where the sensitivity to @xmath5 and @xmath4 is small where the differential cross - section is large , and large where the differential cross - section is small ( such as the angular variable @xmath131 ) .",
    "we divide the phase space into bins , the choice of number and size of the bins roughly determined by the regions of different sensitivity .",
    "we then define our @xmath130 test variable as a sum over these bins @xmath132\\ ] ] where @xmath133 and @xmath134 and @xmath54 are the anomalous and standard cross - sections , respectively .",
    "@xmath135 combines both statistical and systematic errors for the particular bin . @xmath136    where the cross - section is large , the sensitivity , and",
    "consequently the `` variance '' @xmath137 , is small .",
    "however , if @xmath138 is large , then the statistics should be improved , and @xmath135 will also be small .",
    "conversely , for regions where the sensitivity is large ; so also will @xmath135 be , due to the poorer statistics . by summing over these different regions ,",
    "@xmath139 gives a more accurate estimate of the deviation of the non - standard cross - section from the standard .",

    "3 the @xmath155 contour ( corresponding to a @xmath80 significance level ) in @xmath156 and @xmath157 for the @xmath158 process at @xmath34 of 500 gev .",
    "we extract limits from this contour of @xmath159 which are a significant improvement on the constraints achievable from a simple total cross - section measurement .",
    "similarly , the limits for the other parameters and other processes were generally improved by approximately @xmath160 relative to the total cross - section limits through such an analysis .",
    "a more intuitive means of identifying a @xmath1-violating contribution is , rather than looking for non - standard effects in cross - sections , to search directly for evidence of the breaking of the symmetry .",
    "even a small amount of @xmath1 violation in the triple boson vertex could in principle produce clear experimental signatures .",
    "these signatures could consist of asymmetries , for instance , in the numbers of events between two @xmath1-conjugate states . as an example ,",
    "in the process @xmath161 , a difference between the numbers of @xmath162 bosons emitted in the `` forward '' direction , and the number of @xmath163 bosons in the `` backward '' direction , as it distinguishes between these @xmath1-conjugate states , would indicate the breaking of @xmath1 .",
    "different types of observable asymmetries have been suggested as possible indicators of @xmath1-violation @xcite ; these include width asymmetries , partial rate asymmetries such as energy and angular asymmetries , and @xmath1-odd correlations .",
    "we search for non - zero asymmetries in certain measurable observables as evidence for a @xmath1-violating contribution to the tbv .",

    "non - zero values for these helicity asymmetries combine to produce a non - zero value for the total cross - section ; it is therefore possible for large oppositely signed asymmetries in the helicities to combine to give a smaller net asymmetry in the total cross - section .    for @xmath5 and @xmath4 equal to 1 , we show in table iv the asymmetries @xmath176 in the total cross - section for the lepton channels @xmath177 , and @xmath28 .",

    "we also considered asymmetries in the @xmath1-odd , @xmath104-even variable @xmath183 @xcite where @xmath184 is the vector momentum of the incoming electron , @xmath185 that of the outgoing lepton , and @xmath186 that of the outgoing antilepton .",
    "the results were similar to those for the variable @xmath172 .",
    "for an asymmetry in the total cross - section to be measurable , we require that the number of asymmetrical events @xmath187 exceed the fluctuations about the total number of events .",
    "thus our significance requirement for these asymmetries is : @xmath188 if we take a typical value for the cross - section of @xmath189 pb , and with our assumed integrated luminosity of 50 fb@xmath124 , this significance level is approximately 1.5 % . from this quick calculation , it seems that an asymmetry in the total cross - section will most likely be below the statistical significance level , and therefore unresolvable .",
    "the situation is even less encouraging if , instead of @xmath190 , we explore the expected asymmetries for more realistic magnitudes for the anomalous couplings , ie . @xmath5 and @xmath4 at their detection limits .",
    "although it appears that any asymmetry in total cross - section will be below the level of statistical significance , asymmetries in the helicity amplitudes that contribute to the total cross - section might be detectable .",
    "an asymmetry in the total cross - section is a result of a combination of asymmetries in the contributing helicity amplitudes , each weighted by their appropriate helicity cross - sections . since the different helicity amplitudes have contributions from different tbv diagrams , with consequently different sensitivity to anomalous couplings , the asymmetries in these helicity amplitudes can differ in magnitude and sign . in principle",
    "therefore , large but opposing asymmetries can cancel each other to produce a smaller resultant asymmetry in the total cross - section .",
    "we demonstrate this idea by considering the `` differential asymmetries '' .",
    "we define this differential asymmetry @xmath191 as @xmath192 and consider both total and helicity distributions .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "4 the distributions in @xmath193(s ) for the @xmath48 channel at @xmath52 gev for non - standard @xmath194 .",
    "as was previously mentioned , we use the @xmath48 channel to approximate the @xmath10 process .",
    "we show also the approximate statistical error bars about the sm expectation of @xmath193(s)=0 , calculated from the differential cross - section @xmath195 . for sm couplings",
    ", @xmath191 vanishes for each helicity individually .",
    "we see that while the asymmetry in the total cross - section , as it is bounded by the error bars , would be below the statistical significance level and so unresolvable ; that in the @xmath40 helicity amplitude might however be measurable",
    ". a polarized beam facility , by separately generating the different helicity components , might be able to measure these helicity asymmetries and so access this phenomena .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the sensitivity to the wwv coupling parameters through measurement of the processes @xmath196 at center - of - mass energies of 500 gev and 1 tev .",
    "the limits on the @xmath1-even coupling @xmath2 are of the order of @xmath64 at the higher energy , with slightly looser bounds achievable at the lower energy",
    ". these bounds might be significantly improved at a polarized beam facility . because the individual helicity amplitudes can have very different dependence on the tbv , in form and magnitude",
    ", the limits obtainable from an analysis of an individual helicity amplitude can be complementary to those from the other helicities and from a total cross - section analysis .",
    "consequently , combining the limits from the different helicity amplitudes can , for certain of the four lepton final state configurations , significantly tighten the constraints on the anomalous couplings .",
    "smaller improvements are also possible through suitably cutting on the phase space of certain experimental variables .",
    "the sensitivity to anomalous couplings is not always evenly distributed over these variable s distributions ; a cut to isolate the regions of high sensitivity and exclude those of low sensitivity can improve the achievable tbv bounds .",
    "these improvements can be of the order of a factor of two for the @xmath48 process at the lower energy .",
    "the limits on the @xmath1-odd coupling @xmath4 , especially at the higher energy , approach the level of precision predicted necessary by neutron electric dipole moment measurements ; the limits on the @xmath1-odd variable @xmath5 are much looser .",
    "these limits can be improved by accounting for the uneven localization of tbv sensitivity in certain experimental variables through a @xmath197 analysis or a maximum likelihood fit .",
    "an explicitly @xmath1-violating vertex contribution is unlikely to produce measurable asymmetries in the total cross - section .",
    "asymmetries in certain @xmath1-odd variables might however be measurable in the component helicity amplitudes ; a polarized beam facility would be required for this measurement .",
