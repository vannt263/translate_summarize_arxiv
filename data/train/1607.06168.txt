    "traditionally network science has focused on static networks , whose links offer permanent connections between their nodes . yet , it is increasingly recognized that most natural and social systems are best described as _ temporal _ networks , acknowledging that their links exist only intermittently .",
    "for example , within cellular metabolic networks @xcite , the links correspond to brief chemical reactions ; in social networks @xcite friendship links are inferred from face - to - face or digital communications of short duration .",
    "such temporality @xcite has profound effects on most dynamical processes taking place on networks @xcite , slowing down synchronization and the diffusion of innovative information @xcite , impeding exploration and navigation @xcite , and raising barriers to accessibility @xcite . while in static networks",
    "such signal - carrying paths are permanently available , in temporal systems complete instantaneous paths between the inputs and the rest of the nodes are not guaranteed , potentially degrading our ability to control a system .",
    "a temporal network is an ordered sequence of @xmath0 separate networks on the same set of @xmath1 nodes ( fig .",
    "[ fig_main_1]a and  [ fig_main_1]b ) , with each such _ snapshot _",
    "@xmath2 characterized by a ( weighted ) adjacency matrix @xmath3 for a duration @xmath4 . as we aim to uncover the role of the changing network topology , rather than the effect of specific dynamics , we consider that in each snapshot the system is governed by the canonical linear time - invariant dynamics , @xmath5 valid over the time interval @xmath6 , where the @xmath7 is the _ switching time _ between snapshots @xmath8 and @xmath2",
    "; @xmath9 represents the state of each node @xmath10 at time @xmath11 , like the concentration of metabolite @xmath10 within a cell ; the input matrix @xmath12 identifies the set of driver nodes through which we attempt to control the system using @xmath13 independent control inputs @xmath14 , like manipulating the input concentration of @xmath13 metabolites . to avoid conferring an unfair advantage to temporal networks",
    ", we use the same set of driver nodes across all snapshots , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_main_1]c ) , and we assume that we have no control over the order of the snapshots , nor over the timings of the topology changes , hence our influence on the system is confined to the control inputs @xcite . although the dynamics eq .  ( [ temporaldynamics ] ) within each snapshot is linear , the switching process makes the overall dynamics nonlinear @xcite . indeed , temporal networks with dynamics described by eq .",
    "( [ temporaldynamics ] ) are a special case of switched systems @xcite , which can exhibit exotic collective behavior absent in linear systems like multiple limit cycles , chaos , and the zeno - like phenomenon @xcite .",
    "to understand why temporal networks are easier to control than static networks , consider the static three - node network of fig .",
    "[ fig_main_1]d , which is uncontrollable by any single driver node .",
    "indeed , we can only steer the network within a two - dimensional subspace of the three - dimensional state space ( fig .",
    "[ fig_main_1]d ) . yet , the temporal version of the same network  in which the two links are non - simultaneously active_is _ controllable by the top node ( fig .  [ fig_main_1]f ) , as each snapshot of the temporal network an _ independent _ two - dimensional controllable space , making the full three - dimensional state space accessible .    to generalize these concepts to an arbitrary temporal network ,",
    "consider a system initially at @xmath16 .",
    "by considering all possible trajectories from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , we can write the controllable space ( see si ) as @xmath19 here @xmath20 denotes the controllable space of snapshot @xmath2 , where @xmath21 is the column space of @xmath22 .",
    "hence , a temporal network of @xmath1 nodes is controllable if and only if @xmath23 meaning that we can steer the system to an arbitrary state of the state space @xmath24 . for a static network ,",
    "whose snapshots are identical (  @xmath25 ) , eq .",
    "( [ theorm01 ] ) reduces to the classic kalman rank condition @xcite for controllability .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ controllableset_main ] ) , the controllable space grows as the network structure changes , allowing us to determine the number of snapshots @xmath26 that must elapse before a temporal network becomes fully controllable . for comparison",
    ", we also calculate the number of snapshots @xmath27 we must _ aggregate _ in order to obtain a controllable static network ( see si ) under the same sequence of snapshots and set of driver nodes .",
    "[ fig_main_1]c , which shows a temporal network four snapshots , none of which is individually controllable using the top node as the sole driver node . according to eq .",
    "( [ theorm01 ] ) the temporal sequence becomes controllable at the second snapshot , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath28 ( fig .  [ fig_main_1]f ) .",
    "in contrast , we must aggregate @xmath29 snapshots to obtain a controllable static network ( fig .",
    "[ fig_main_1]d , e ) .",
    "the difference between @xmath27 and @xmath26 captures the relative control benefits of a dense ( but fixed ) network topology versus a relatively sparse ( but time - varying ) topology , respectively . while there is no theoretical guarantee that @xmath26 is always less than @xmath27 , as we show next , we find that real temporal networks reach controllability much faster than their static counterparts . here",
    "`` faster '' refers to the number of snapshots we need to reach full controllability .",
    "hence the time to control ( embodied in @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) is distinct from @xmath30 , representing the time a system needs to reach its final state @xcite .    to demonstrate the practical relevance of our finding",
    ", we explore an empirical communication dataset collected by the sociopatterns collaboration , capturing face - to - face conversations between the attendees of a conference @xcite ; an ecological network , capturing antenna - body interactions between ants @xcite ; a biological network capturing the temporal dynamics of protein - protein interactions @xcite ; and a technological network recording data packet exchanges in an emulated mobile ad - hoc network .",
    "the aggregation window @xmath31 ( over which we condense interactions into snapshots ) offers an inverse measure of temporality : for small @xmath31 , we obtain a large number of sparse , disjoint snapshots , while for large @xmath31 we approach a single snapshot corresponding to the full static network ( fig .",
    "[ fig_main_1]a and  [ fig_main_1]b ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_main_2 ] shows @xmath26 and @xmath27 for different time windows @xmath31 , indicating that the number of snapshots required to control a temporal network @xmath26 is always less than that for its static counterpart , @xmath27 .",
    "the higher the temporality ( smaller @xmath31 ) , the more pronounced the advantage of temporal networks .",
    "for example , for the face - to - face interactions at @xmath32 the temporal networks reach controllability after only @xmath33 time steps ( 19.72 hours ) , while we must aggregate @xmath34 snapshots over two days to obtain a static network that is controllable . to see to",
    "what extent these gains in controllability depend on the topology of the underlying snapshots , or on the inter - event characteristics of the temporal patterns , we calculate @xmath26 and @xmath27 for randomized versions of the empirical data , using null models that permute the overall network structure , the relative time orderings of the edges , or both @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "we find that @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_main_2 ] ) , indicating that the observed advantage is independent of how the network changes in time .",
    "in other words , temporality alone is sufficient to improve controllability .",
    "our ability to control a system is determined not only by the time it takes to reach controllability , but also by the amount of effort ( energy ) required to reach a particular final state .",
    "we develop a formalism ( see si ) to calculate the minimum input energy @xmath36 required to drive a temporal network from an initial state @xmath37 to final state @xmath38 , obtaining @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the difference vector between the desired final state @xmath38 and the natural final state that the system reaches without control inputs , and the @xmath41 matrix @xmath42 encodes the energy structure of the temporal network . for identical snapshots",
    "@xmath42 reduces to the controllability gramian @xmath43 and eq .",
    "( [ retemp ] ) provides the control energy of a static network ( see si ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_main_3 ] compares the control energy eq .",
    "( [ retemp ] ) of a typical synthetic temporal network as well as the technological network with its static counterpart for various aggregation times @xmath31 ( see si ) . in both cases",
    "we find that the average control energy of a temporal network is many orders of magnitude smaller than that of the corresponding static network . the effect is particularly pronounced for small @xmath31 : for @xmath44 the energy difference between the static and temporal network exceeds @xmath45 orders of magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig_main_3]a , b ) . in other words ,",
    "high temporality , corresponding to rapid changes in the network topology , offers remarkable energy savings .",
    "for example , the energy required to control the technological network of fig .",
    "[ fig_main_2]d drops by 274 orders of magnitude when the true temporal nature of the network is taken into account ( fig .",
    "[ fig_main_3]d ) . in both temporal and static networks",
    "we can reduce the control energy by using more driver nodes @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig_main_3]b ) .",
    "yet the gap between the temporal and static network persists until _ all _ nodes are directly controlled ( fig .",
    "[ fig_main_3]c , e ) .",
    "finally , a direct comparison of the control energy distributions for static vs. temporal networks reveals only a small overlap in certain regimes ( fig .",
    "[ fig_main_3 ] , insets ) .",
    "this indicates that the _ worst_-case control direction in a temporal network is often better than the _",
    "best _ case control direction in its static counterpart .    the extreme energy savings characterizing temporal networks arise from the fact that there are orders of magnitude differences in the energy required to move in different directions in the state space @xcite . in a static network ,",
    "if we must travel in an energetically costly direction , we have no choice but to spend the required energy to `` push '' against the system s dynamics .",
    "by contrast , in a temporal network we can exploit the changing topology to avoid these expensive directions .",
    "much like navigating a sailboat , it is easier to travel in a particular direction if we exploit the shifts in the wind direction ( the vector field of the network dynamics ) : we raise the sails when the wind helps us and pull them back when it works against us . in other words ,",
    "we only push towards the desired final state when the topology renders the energy cost acceptable , and pause when the topology makes the cost prohibitive .        for a single snapshot @xmath172 ( or equivalently , a static network ) , the minimum energy for controlling the system from @xmath37 at @xmath173",
    "to @xmath38 at @xmath30 corresponds to the unique input of the form @xmath174 , where @xmath175 and @xmath176 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath177 is a constant vector determined by @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath173 , and the system s dynamics .    according to the principle of optimality ,",
    "if @xmath59 is the energy - optimal input to control a temporal network , then the energy accumulated over each snapshot must also be minimal for the control sub - problem of traveling between the states at the beginning and end of that snapshot .",
    "hence we we can write the candidate energy optimal control signals for a temporal network as @xmath178 based on the above , the solution for the temporal network is @xmath179    using the following notations @xmath180   \\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\int_{0}^{\\tau_m}{\\mathrm{e}}^{{\\mathbf{a}}_{m } \\tau } { \\mathbf{b}}_{m}{\\mathbf{b}}_{m}^\\textrm{t } { \\mathrm{e}}^{{\\mathbf{a}}^\\textrm{t}_{m } \\tau } \\mathrm{d } \\tau = { \\mathbf{w}}_{m}[0 , \\tau_m ] , \\\\ \\nonumber \\textbf{\\textrm{c } } & = &   \\left(\\textbf{\\textrm{c}}^{\\textrm{t}}_{1},\\textbf{\\textrm{c}}^{\\textrm{t}}_{2},\\cdots,\\textrm{\\textbf{c}}^{\\textrm{t}}_{m } \\right ) ^ { \\textrm{t } } , \\\\ \\nonumber \\textbf{\\textrm{h } } & = & \\left ( { \\mathrm{e}}^{{\\mathbf{a}}_{m}\\tau_m } \\cdots { \\mathrm{e}}^{{\\mathbf{a}}_{2}\\tau_2 } { \\mathbf{w}}_{1 } , \\cdots,{\\mathrm{e}}^{{\\mathbf{a}}_{m}\\tau_m } \\cdots { \\mathrm{e}}^{{\\mathbf{a}}_{{m+1}}\\tau_{m+1 } } { \\mathbf{w}}_{m } , \\cdots,{\\mathbf{w}}_{m } \\right )   = { \\mathbf{s}}{\\mathbf{w } } , \\\\ { \\mathbf{s } } & = &   \\left({\\mathrm{e}}^{{\\mathbf{a}}_{m}\\tau_m } \\cdots { \\mathrm{e}}^{{\\mathbf{a}}_{2}\\tau_2 } , \\cdots,{\\mathrm{e}}^{{\\mathbf{a}}_{m}\\tau_m } \\cdots { \\mathrm{e}}^{{\\mathbf{a}}_{{m+1}}\\tau_{m+1 } } , \\cdots,\\textrm{\\textbf{i}}_n \\right ) \\\\ \\nonumber   & = &   \\left (   \\prod_{l = m}^2 { \\mathrm{e}}^{{\\mathbf{a}}_{l}\\tau_l } , \\cdots ,   \\prod_{l = m}^{m+1 } { \\mathrm{e}}^{{\\mathbf{a}}_{l}\\tau_l }   , \\cdots,\\textrm{\\textbf{i}}_n \\right ) ,   \\label{es }   \\\\ \\nonumber   { \\mathbf{w } } & = & \\text{diag}({\\mathbf{w}}_{1},{\\mathbf{w}}_{2},\\cdots,{\\mathbf{w}}_{m}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can write ( [ solutionforteme ] ) as @xmath181 .",

    "hereafter , we refer to the minimum control energy @xmath235 as simply the _ control energy _ @xmath236",
    ".    for controllability in the case @xmath16 , above results reduce to @xmath237 and @xmath238      when all snapshots are identical ( @xmath239 ) , our results reduce to the case for static networks . indeed , for static networks , the quadratic programming ( [ quadraticprogrammingsi ] ) becomes @xmath240 if the system is controllable , @xmath241 is nonsingular , and so there is a unique solution @xmath242 .",
    "hence , the optimal solution from above quadratic programming determines the optimal input as @xmath243 by which we have @xmath244 where @xmath245 .",
    "the result for @xmath246 is same as that given in @xcite .",
    "as @xmath247 for @xmath248 , we have @xmath249 thus the energy for controlling temporal networks ( [ minietemp ] ) reduces to the result for static networks ( [ restatic ] ) .",
    "real systems often obey constraints that forbid the states of the nodes from taking arbitrary values .",
    "for instance , the generator frequencies in the power grid can only vary within a narrow range around their normal operating point , without inducing failures , and metabolite concentrations @xcite within a cell must always be non - negative .",
    "these limitations mean that the control trajectories can not wander arbitrarily far into the state space , but must exhibit a high degree of _ locality _ @xcite .    to test the degree of locality in temporal networks",
    ", we calculate the length of each control trajectory using @xmath46 , where the energy - optimal trajectory for temporal networks as they move from @xmath37 to @xmath38 follows @xmath47{\\mathbf{c}}^*_m\\ ] ] for @xmath6 , where @xmath48 $ ] is the gramian matrix of snapshot @xmath2 , and @xmath49 is a constant vector of dimension @xmath1 ( see si ) .",
    "in general , @xmath50 depends on the initial state @xmath37 and the state space distance @xmath51 between the origin and destination points ( fig .",
    "[ fig_main_4]b ) . for @xmath52 , in both static and temporal networks , @xmath50 increases linearly with @xmath53 ( see fig .  [ fig_main_4]b and figs .",
    "s13 , s14 , s16 ) . yet , for any @xmath53 the optimal control trajectories in temporal networks are about five orders of magnitude shorter than in their static counterparts ( fig .",
    "[ fig_main_4]b ) .",
    "the difference is particularly remarkable in real systems : for the technological network the temporal trajectory is @xmath54 orders of magnitude shorter than for the corresponding static network ( fig .",
    "[ fig_main_4]c ) .",
    "indeed , it is known that in static networks @xmath50 can be large even when @xmath53 approaches zero , implying static control generally demands highly non - local control trajectories @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we find that the dynamical flexibility offered by temporality allows @xmath55 not to have to wander far into phase space as it moves from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "the sailing analogy helps once again to understand this difference : travel against the prevailing wind is possible , but we must use complicated zig  zagging maneuvers to reach our destination .",
    "if , however , the wind occasionally changes directions , a strategic use of the sails allows us to travel more directly to our destination .",
    "previous studies have shown that static networks , even if they theoretically satisfy the controllability conditions , can be difficult to control in practice .",
    "for example , networks with heterogeneous degree distributions , ubiquitous in natural systems , require a high fraction of the nodes to be directly controlled @xcite . making matters worse",
    ", the prohibitive energetic cost of some trajectories leads to an unavoidable tradeoff between the number of driver nodes and the time to control , and the nonlocality of the available control trajectories @xcite further strains the controllability of static systems .",
    "how do we reconcile this practical difficulty of control with the observation that in order to perform their proper functions , real natural and technological systems must have the ability to drive themselves to ( and keep themselves in ) desired states ?",
    "temporal networks appear to be a promising solution to this conundrum .",
    "when we aim to control a network that periodically changes its structure , we observe _ simultaneous _ reductions in all relevant control metrics , from time to control to control energy and trajectory lengths , the effect size surpassing many orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , our results suggest a hitherto unappreciated role for temporality , which has traditionally been viewed as an impediment for network dynamics . by exploiting the best parts of the dynamics of each subsnapshot",
    ", we can therefore enjoy the `` best of all worlds . ''    finally , the temporal networks we explored are inherently nonlinear systems .",
    "consistent with previous finding that nonlinearity can help control dynamical systems , from driving systems to desired attractors @xcite to chaos control @xcite , our results indicate that nonlinearity induced by temporality can be an asset , rather than an obstacle .",
