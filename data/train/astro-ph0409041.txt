    "tracing and understanding the history of cosmic star formation and the growth of the cosmic stellar mass density are currently the objects of major observational efforts ( e.g. , dickinson et al .",
    "2003 ; fontana et al . 2003 ; rudnick et al .",
    "2003 ) , yet much remains to be done before reaching fully satisfactorily conclusions .",
    "obtaining a complete census of the populations of high - redshift galaxies , and their physical characterization ( stellar mass and star - formation rate , sfr ) is necessary to observationally map the processes that lead to galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "this requires direct spectroscopic identification ( e.g. , fontana et al .",
    "2004 ; glazebrook et al .",
    "2004 ) , but building large samples of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at high redshift is a time consuming process .",
    "this is especially true for magnitude - limited samples , as high-@xmath1 galaxies represent a small fraction of the galaxy counts at faint magnitudes in the optical and infrared bands .",
    "therefore , techniques for pre - selecting high redshift targets are required to focus the spectroscopic multiplex capability on the interesting objects .",
    "photometric redshifts from deep multicolor datasets offer an alternative to massive spectroscopic efforts ( e.g. bolzonella et al .",
    "2002 ; firth et al . 2002 ; poli et al .",
    "2003 ) , but the results may suffer from biases that are difficult to quantify , and their accuracy depends critically on the quality of the photometry and the colors and redshifts of the objects .",
    "an efficient alternative to either photometric redshifts or magnitude limited surveys is offered by simpler single or two - color criteria , then followed by targeted spectroscopy .",
    "the best known example is the dropout technique for selecting lyman - break galaxies ( lbg , steidel et al . 1996 ; 2003 ) from their @xmath24 rest - frame uv colors , which opened the research field on normal star - forming galaxies at @xmath25 .",
    "recently , the same technique has been extended to work at lower redshifts @xmath26 ( erb et al .",
    "2003 ; adelberger et al . 2004 ) and large samples of uv - selected objects have been spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath18 ( steidel et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "star forming galaxies can be selected as lbgs only if they are uv bright ( i.e. actively star forming ) and not heavily reddened by dust .",
    "currently , the best possible alternatives to find dust - enshrouded high redshift star - forming objects include detecting them from their far - ir or sub - mm emission due to cold dust ( franceschini et al .",
    "2001 ; smail et al .",
    "2002 ; champan et al .",
    "2003 ) , observing the emission at x - ray or radio wavelengths that are not extincted by dust ( e.g. , norman et al . 2004",
    "; haarsma et al .",
    "2000 ) , and selecting very red objects in near - infrared samples that are less affected by dust extinction ( cimatti et al . 2002a , 2003 ) .    besides targeting star - forming galaxies ,",
    "color criteria have also been used to search for passively evolving galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "a simple criterion is the one used for extremely red objects ( ero ) , selected according to their very red optical to near - ir colors , e.g. @xmath27 or @xmath28 ( thompson et al 1999 ; daddi et al .",
    "2000a ; 2000b ; firth et al .",
    "2002 ; roche et al . 2002 ; 2003 ; miyazaki et al . 2003",
    "; mccarthy 2004 ) .",
    "spectroscopy showed that eros include both old passive galaxies at @xmath29 and dusty star - forming systems at similar redshifts ( cimatti et al . 2002a , 2003 ; yan et al .",
    "the bulk of eros , however , is made of galaxies at redshifts @xmath30 with only a small fraction being at @xmath31 , a crucial redshift range for the evolution of galaxies . in order to identify old stellar systems at @xmath18 or beyond , color criteria based on @xmath32 and @xmath2 imaging",
    "have been proposed ( e.g. , pozzetti & mannucci 2000 ; totani et al .",
    "2001 ; franx et al .",
    "2003 ; saracco et al .",
    "2004 ) . as confirmed by van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , objects with red spectral energy distributions at @xmath31 , can be selected requiring very red colors @xmath33 ( vega scale ) .",
    "although the selection of objects with extremely red colors has been quite successful , one could expect that moderately old , or moderately reddened , objects exist at high redshift that would be missed by both the  red - color \" techniques and by the uv techniques .",
    "in addition , it appears unsatisfactory to use so many different color criteria in order to build representative samples of galaxies as a function of redshifts , as the physical relations between these different classes remain unknown , and the selection biases not fully understood .",
    "the recently completed k20 survey ( cimatti et al .",
    "2002a , b , c ; daddi et al .",
    "2002 ; pozzetti et al . 2003 ; fontana et al . 2004 )",
    "has reached an unprecedented spectroscopic completeness ( @xmath34 ) for a sample of @xmath9 galaxies . in particular , for one of the two k20 fields ( included in the cdf - s / goods - s field ) the recent deep observations ( daddi et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter d04 ; cimatti et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ; vanzella et al .",
    "2004 ) allowed to reach a spectroscopic completeness of @xmath35 .",
    "this includes the presence of a significant fraction of high redshift , @xmath36 , galaxies ( redshift desert coverage ) .    in this paper",
    "we take advantage of the k20 spectroscopic sample to define a simple two - color criterion based on the @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath2-band photometry which , with a minimal contamination from lower redshift galaxies , is capable of identifying the full range of high - redshift @xmath36 galaxies in our @xmath2-selected sample , including both actively star - forming ( d04 ) and old passive objects ( cimatti et al . 2004 ) , and to distinguish between the two classes .",
    "for galaxies identified with this criterion ( at least to @xmath37 ) it is found that a @xmath2-band selection is close to a galaxy stellar - mass selection , while a @xmath2-selected sample of star - forming galaxies allows to reach completeness down to a given star - formation rate limit almost independently of dust reddening .",
    "therefore , the technique offers a powerful tool to explore with the minimum possible biases the histories of cosmic star - formation and cosmic stellar - mass build - up at @xmath18 .",
    "we discuss in detail to which extent the cosmic stellar - mass and star - formation rate density can be estimated with the properties of galaxies in the proposed two - color diagram .",

    "an exception is the hierarchical model by granato et al ( 2004 ) based on the assumption of a coeval growth of qsos and spheroids , which succeeds in producing the high space density of near - ir bright @xmath19 galaxies ( see also silva et al .",
    "however , in its current realization this model predicts that the @xmath36 tail of @xmath2-selected galaxies is predominantly populated by passively - evolving spheroids ( see fig . 8 in silva",
    "et al . 2004 ) , at variance with the observed prevalence of vigorous starbursts .",
    "the recent @xmath189cdm hydrodynamical simulations by nagamine et al . ( 2004 ) appear instead quite successful in reproducing the space density of @xmath275 massive galaxies at @xmath19 , as observed in the k20 survey , at least in two out of three of its different realizations . in one of their three simulation sets",
    "the authors also recover 2 galaxies with old stellar populations and red @xmath276 colors , consistent with the colors of passive spheroids at @xmath36 found in k20 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lbg_z2 ] ) and well matching to the k20 space density of passive sources when accounting for the different volumes .",
    "it is not clear instead if these models can reproduce the observed high density of vigorous starbursts with sfr@xmath270 yr@xmath42 , as observed in our survey .    as recently pointed out by cimatti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and grazebrook et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , in the traditional semianalytic models the formation of massive spheroids appears to be delayed to much too low redshifts . on the other hand , the granato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) models appear to move in the right direction , by pushing the formation to higher redshift with strong bursts of star - formation , then quenched by strong agn activity . however ,",
    "in doing so they may exceed somewhat , as compared to our findings they appear to underpredict the number of starbursting galaxies still present at @xmath127 .",
    "the present results , and an application of the @xmath8 selection to substantially larger samples , may help in further tuning theoretical models toward a more realistic description of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "@xmath277 we have introduced a new criterion for selecting galaxies within the redshift range @xmath278 which is based on the @xmath8 photometry and allows to identify both active star - forming as well as passively - evolving galaxies , and to distinguish between the two classes .",
    "the criterion has been tested empirically  using the spectroscopic redshifts and spectral types from the k20 survey ( @xmath9 ) including 32 @xmath36 objects out of 504 with a spectroscopic redshift  and justified by simulations showing that active and passive synthetic stellar populations actually follow this selection criterion and are correctly identified .",
    "albeit smaller in size , other spectroscopic samples such as the gdds and photometric redshift of faint galaxies from the goods samples ( as currently available ) confirm that the criterion is effective in selecting galaxies in the mentioned redshift range and also for limiting @xmath2-band magnitudes somewhat fainter than @xmath37 .",
    "we have shown that this @xmath8 criterion provides a very efficient way of selecting galaxies at @xmath105 , that is not biased against passive galaxies and star forming galaxies that are highly reddened .    @xmath277 the classification of @xmath9 , @xmath36 galaxies as actively star forming or passive was then complemented by hst / acs morphologies from the goods database , showing that indeed the spectral and morphological classifications are generally consistent : star - forming galaxies show clumpy , asymmetric morphologies typical of starbursts and mergers , while passive galaxies show symmetric surface brightness distribution in general typical of early - type galaxies .",
    "@xmath277 it is shown that the @xmath8 photometry can be used to estimate the internal reddening for the k20 galaxies classified as star - forming , and their intrinsic luminosity at 1500  .",
    "this allows an estimate of their dust - extinction corrected sfrs .",
    "the x - ray and radio luminosities of these galaxies provide sfr estimates in very good agreement with the ones from the de - reddened 1500   luminosity .",
    "@xmath277 a significant population of @xmath19 galaxies with @xmath9 , average sfr@xmath279 @xmath39 yr@xmath42 , and median reddening @xmath16 is uncovered as a result , with a high volume density of @xmath13 mpc@xmath14 and sky density of @xmath280 arcmin@xmath12 .",
    "these vigorous starbursts produce a sfrd of @xmath281 @xmath39 yr@xmath42 mpc@xmath14 , representing a sizeable fraction of the total sfrd at @xmath19 as currently estimated .",
    "@xmath277 for @xmath8-selected galaxies at @xmath278 the stellar mass derived from their redshift and multicolor photometry is tightly correlated to the observed @xmath2-band magnitude ( with a @xmath282 dispersion of @xmath283 ) , at least down to @xmath37 .    @xmath277 the @xmath8 selection and the above correlations ( @xmath8 vs. @xmath125 and @xmath8 vs. stellar mass ) provide a fairly accurate and economic method that might be statistically applied to the very large samples of galaxies coming from the current or imminent wide - area surveys and/or for galaxy samples beyond the present spectroscopic capabilities .    @xmath277 a comparison with the uv - selected galaxies at @xmath284 ( steidel et al .",
    "2004 ) , including those at the same @xmath2 limit , shows that @xmath8-selected star - forming galaxies have typically higher reddening and sfrs . among our @xmath9 sample ,",
    "the galaxies satisfying the ugr selection criterion contribute roughly @xmath285% of the sfrd at @xmath127 produced by the whole k20 sample . on the other hand the surface density of the steidel et al .",
    "uv - selected galaxies down to @xmath286 is @xmath250 times higher than that of @xmath9 star - forming galaxies in the same redshift range , and their contribution to the sfrd at @xmath127 is a factor @xmath287 higher than that of the @xmath9 , @xmath8-selected galaxies .",
    "@xmath277 the @xmath8 galaxies at @xmath127 are characterized by a much higher sfr ( by a factor @xmath288 on average ) compared to dusty , star - forming eros ( @xmath27 ) at @xmath30 , and @xmath9 .",
    "we conclude that these vigorous starbursts at @xmath127 are of a different nature compared to highly reddened @xmath30 galaxies .",
    "@xmath277 a @xmath8 analysis of the infrared - selected galaxies with @xmath33 ( franx et al .",
    "2003 ) detected within the k20 survey shows that those with @xmath31 are likely to be reddened star - forming objects , rather than passively evolving galaxies .",

    "@xmath277 @xmath8- and submm / mm - selected galaxies appear to share properties such as the redshift distribution , high sfrs and high masses , but the former ones have higher space density while the latter ones have higher sfrs .",
    "an interesting hypothesis is that submm / mm selected star - forming galaxies might represent extreme subsets of @xmath8 galaxies , at least when lying at @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath277 being based on the rest - frame shape of the spectra of starburst and passive galaxies , the @xmath8 criterion can be modified to select the same kinds of galaxies within a higher redshift range . in this mood ,",
    "we propose a @xmath22 criterion to select galaxies within the range @xmath229 , which would complement the @xmath8 selection of @xmath26 galaxies . with uniquely deep @xmath223-band ( @xmath291 m ) data that is becoming available from the spitzer space telescope , this criterion should allow a selection of massive galaxies at @xmath292 that may efficiently complement the traditional lbg selection .",
    "@xmath277 the high masses , sfrs , and metallicities of the bright @xmath8-selected galaxies at @xmath127 , together with a hint for a strong clustering of them , qualify these galaxies as possible precursors of @xmath30 passively evolving eros and @xmath20 early - type galaxies .",
    "a @xmath256 test indicates that the space density of these galaxies may increase with redshift in the range @xmath278 .",
    "current theoretical simulations of hierarchical galaxy formation generally fail to account simultaneously for the space density of both passively evolving and star - forming galaxies at @xmath19 .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations can reproduce our observations better than semyanalitical models .",
    "some of the above conclusions may be affected by cosmic variance , given the relatively small size of the explored field . to cope with this limitation",
    "a project is underway to cull @xmath8-selected galaxies over a @xmath293 arcmin@xmath46 field , @xmath193 times larger than the full k20 survey area , by combining @xmath2-band data from eso telescopes with optical data from suprimecam at the subaru telescope ( kong et al . in preparation ) , and to follow them up spectroscopically with vimos at the vlt .",
    "the validity of the @xmath8 selection at faint @xmath94 magnitudes will be further tested in great detail with a planned vlt / fors2 survey ( gmass project ) targeting among others @xmath8 selected galaxies fainter than @xmath37 .",
