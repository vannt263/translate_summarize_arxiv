    "this is the strategy that we have used in the present paper in order to explore the discovery potential of lhc as far as light neutralinos are concerned .",

    "we limited our discussion to the case in which the gluino is heavier than the squark ; for definiteness , we have set the su(3 ) gaugino mass at the representative value @xmath9 = 2 tev and the squark soft - mass at the value @xmath221 = 1 tev .",
