    "vertical two - phase flows of thin liquid films sheared by a counter - current gas are prototypical for many technical applications , such as absorption and distillation ( using structured packing ) , evaporation and condensation . in these applications , not only mass and heat transfer but also operational limits",
    "are closely linked to the prevailing hydrodynamics .",
    "the flow in the two phases , in turn , is largely determined by the interactions between gas and liquid at its interface .",
    "although gas - sheared liquid films have been part of active research on fundamental and practical level for several decades , the rich interfacial dynamics are still not fully understood .",
    "these rich dynamics emerge as the liquid interface becomes unstable , leading to the development of waves . depending on the flow rates",
    ", these waves can form highly complex structures , which may give rise to wave break - up , ligament formation and droplet entrainment .",
    "one of the first to investigate a channel flow with two superimposed fluid layers from a theoretical point was yih  @xcite , who used asymptotic expansion to solve the orr - sommerfeld eigenvalue problem associated with the temporal linear stability in the long wavelength limit for equal densities and layer thicknesses .",
    "he found that viscosity stratification alone can cause interfacial instability at arbitrarily small reynolds numbers , which is also referred to as yih mechanism .",
    "yiantsios  @xcite extended the linear stability analysis by accounting for short waves as well as effects due to surface tension and gravity .",
    "they observed that , depending on the choice of parameters , the flow is receptive to a short - wave instability at low reynolds numbers and , moreover , to a shear mode instability ( tollmien - schlichting mechanism ) for sufficiently large reynolds numbers . to classify the various types of instabilities arising in parallel two - phase flow , boomkamp _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analysed by which mechanism energy is transferred from the primary flow to growing disturbances , thereby verifying that both the yih and shear mode are important routes to interfacial instability .",
    "in fact , a combination of these two mechanisms , also referred to as internal mode , represents a further possible route .",
    "an established method to obtain the full spectrum of eigenvalues in the orr - sommerfeld problem is the chebyshev collocation method  @xcite .",
    "this method can also be used to determine whether the interface is convectively or absolutely unstable  @xcite , a characteristic that is of importance for the operation of processes utilizing shear flows .",
    "an extensive review on the analysis of spatially developing flows can be found in reference  @xcite .",
    "linear stability analysis is an effective and proven technique to gain valuable insight in the genesis of interfacial instability .",
    "however , its validity is limited to disturbances with infinitesimal amplitude .",
    "as these disturbances grow , nonlinear effects become important and have to be taken into account . due to the complexity of nonlinear stability",
    "only few general theories exist  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , a variety of modelling techniques have been proposed to describe the development of the interfacial waves up to finite amplitude .",
    "some of these techniques impose _ a priori _ assumptions about the wave dynamics under investigation , like long - wave or lubrication approximation , resulting in model equations such as the kuramoto - sivashinsky equation or depth - averaged integral equations .",
    "a large number of studies on the nonlinear dynamics of interfacial flows are based on these kind of models  @xcite .",
    "however , given that their range of applicability is generally not known in advance , they may at times be prone to ambiguous results  @xcite .",
    "this is especially the case for fairly `` punishing '' flow regimes , involving large pressure fluctuations and potentially large - amplitude waves , for which there is a major necessity to gain fundamental understanding . on the other hand , weakly nonlinear theories based on either the stuart - landau or the ginzburg - landau equations dispense with assumptions that can not be confirmed a priori and are capable of matching experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "such `` pure '' weakly nonlinear theories are therefore appropriate to complement direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the full navier - stokes equations , which , in turn , are guided by basic orr - sommerfeld ( os ) analysis , to study interfacial instability in a rigorous manner .    the aforementioned techniques have helped to shed light on the genesis and development of interfacial instability in shear flows and a good understanding of the mechanisms at play has been gained . however , a substantial amount of the available literature is dedicated to horizontal flows or flows down an inclined plane .",
    "flow dynamics specific to a vertical configuration have not received as much attention even though the same methods are applicable .",
    "phenomena related to this configuration , such as partial liquid flow reversal due to counter - current gas ( flooding ) , influence the design , optimization as well as operation of technical processes to a great extent and have hitherto mainly been investigated experimentally . we therefore try to help elucidate the rich dynamics of vertical counter - current gas - liquid flows from a more theoretical standpoint using the ( semi-)analytical methods and simulation techniques described above .    in this work",
    "we consider the laminar - laminar case only , although the ideas and results contained herein can be extended to turbulent gas streams .",
    "the most accurate methodology appropriate for such an enhanced level of complexity is full - scale dns , which is the target of future work .",
    "however , short of full - scale dns , a quasi - laminar model may be assumed for the linear stability of the two - phase flow  @xcite or , alternatively , a weighted residual integral boundary layer method ( wribl ) model  @xcite , which also models nonlinear interfacial waves .",
    "these approaches both have their own advantages and shortcomings , and the aim of future work will be to confirm these reduced - dimensional modelling approaches with evidence from accurate dns , towards which the present work is an initial contribution .",

    "mode competition and mode coalescence between the multiple unstable modes hindered the mapping of convective and absolute instability in the respective parameter space .",
    "for such systems , linearized dns  @xcite may allow for more conclusive results .    to assess the development of interfacial waves up to finite amplitudes",
    ", we perform direct numerical simulations for parameters within the established flow regimes of the low - density - ratio case , using a level set method based solver that has been developed in - house .",
    "these simulations show excellent agreement with linear theory during the stage of exponential wave growth and confirm the determined flow patterns .",
    "the simulations also show saturation of the waves once nonlinear effects become important .",
    "a fourier analysis reveals that the growth of the higher harmonics of the interfacial waves is coupled to that of the fundamental in a fashion which is consistent with weakly nonlinear theory .",
    "the growth of the first harmonic also agrees well with the stuart - landau model , thus underpinning the weakly nonlinear nature of the instability and , moreover , suggesting the existence of a supercritical bifurcation . regarding high - density - contrast conditions ,",
    "the dynamics of the ( short - wave ) interfacial mode appear to be similar to those observed under low density ratio .",
    "however , direct numerical simulations suggest that the emergence of an additional ( long - wave ) shear mode triggers a secondary instability , which leads to a chaotic wave train showing signs of imminent wave overturning .    in summary , the combination of generic complementary ( semi-)analytical and numerical methods presented herein yields a comprehensive and convincing characterization of interfacial instability in vertical counter - current gas - liquid flows .",
    "we are therefore confident that this rigorous methodology can be employed to further elucidate the dynamics of parallel shear flows in a wide range of technically relevant parameter regimes , such as flows with high viscosity contrast or non - steady gas flow . beyond that",
