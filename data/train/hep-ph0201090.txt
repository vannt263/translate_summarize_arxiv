    "present evidence for neutrino masses and mixings can be summarized as : 1 ) the atmospheric @xmath4ev@xmath5 is associated with a mixing , @xmath6 , near to maximal @xcite ; 2 ) the solar @xmath7 prefers the lma - msw solution @xcite ; chooz reactor data @xcite give severe limits for @xmath8 . in this contribution we are going to discuss that contrary to a wide spread belief , earth effects on the propagation of atmospheric neutrinos can become observable @xcite even if @xmath8 is small , but non - vanishing .",
    "this fact would allow to determine the sign of @xmath3 @xcite . for baselines",
    "@xmath9 smaller than the earth diameter , appropiate for atmospheric neutrinos , @xmath10 , so that we will neglect the ( 1,2)-oscillating phase in vacuum against the ( 2,3)-one .",
    "this is a very good aproximation , unless the high @xmath7-region of the lma solution turns out to be the solution to the solar problem . in that case",
    "we should take into account corrections of order @xmath11 ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the correspondence between the determination of the sign of @xmath3 and the observation of the earth effects in a transition involving @xmath12 .",
    "the change expected in the neutrino spectrum and mixing due to matter effects is pointed out .",
    "section 3 studies the observability of the msw - resonance , with a positive conclusion for baselines @xmath13 7000 km , and its impact on the survival probability , @xmath14 .",
    "section 4 gives an analysis of the matter - induced cpt - odd asymmetry , together with the realistic charge - asymmetry expected for atmospheric neutrinos . in section 5",
    "we present some conclusions .",
    "current analyses leave us with two alternatives for the spectrum of the three active neutrino species , either hierarchical or degenerate .",
    "the effective neutrino potential due to the charged current interaction of @xmath12 with the electrons in the medium is @xcite @xmath15 , so that the effective hamiltonian , in the extreme relativistic limit , is given by @xcite    @xmath16    in going from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , there are matter - induced cp- and cpt- odd effects associated with the change @xmath19 .",
    "the additional change u @xmath20 u@xmath21 is inoperative in the limit of ( [ h ] ) .",
    "the effects we are going to discuss depend on the interference between the different flavors and on the relative sign between @xmath22 and @xmath3 . as a consequence , an experimental distinction between the propagation of @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( the sign of @xmath22 ) will determine the sign of @xmath3 .",
    "an appreciable interference will be present if and only if there are appreciable matter effects . for atmospheric neutrinos",
    ", one needs the `` connecting '' mixing @xmath23 between the @xmath12-flavor and the @xmath24 mass eigenstate to show up .",
    "for small @xmath25 @xcite , even if the effects on the spectrum are expected to be small with respect to the decoupling of the @xmath12-flavour in matter , there could be a substantial mixing of @xmath12 with @xmath26 if one is near to a situation of level - crossing .",
    "this would lead to a resonant msw behaviour @xcite .",
    "@xmath27    but still @xmath28 , i.  e. , the @xmath12 has no overlap with the lowest mass eigenstate in matter .",
    "this vanishing mixing in matter is responsible for the absence of fundamental cp - violating effects , even if there are three non - degenerate mass eigenstates in matter . in vacuum ,",
    "the absence of genuine cp - odd probabilities was due to the degeneracy @xmath29 .",
    "the step from vanishing @xmath30 in vacuum to the vanishing mixing @xmath31 in matter was termed a `` transmutation '' @xcite .",
    "for atmospheric @xmath1 neutrinos , matter effects in the survival probability @xmath32 would be minute unless the resonance shows up .",
    "the resonance is not apparent even at @xmath9 = 3000 km , appropiate for neutrino factories @xcite .",
    "is there a way out ?",
    "again , a non - vanishing connecting mixing @xmath33 provides the solution .",
    "along with it , there is a resonance width which , when discussed in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath34 , is given by    @xmath35    one discovers that the oscillating phase on the resonance is non - vanishing , but given by the @xmath9-dependent relation    @xmath36    if @xmath37 , with optimal @xmath9 , @xmath38 , defined by @xmath39 , the resonance does not affect the oscillation probability . on the contrary , around @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , the resonance becomes apparent and @xmath38 is independent of @xmath42 , which determines the resonant energy .",
    "for @xmath43 , the maximum mixing is accompanied by maximum oscillating factor .    under these conditions ,",
    "all channels would see the resonant effect .",
    "contrary to non - resonant matter effects , the resonance only affects the ( anti)neutrino channels if @xmath44 .",
    "as discussed in section 3 , matter effects distinguish neutrinos from antineutrinos .",
    "it is convenient to present them in terms of cp - odd ( for appearance channels ) and cpt - odd ( for the survival probabilities ) asymmetries . in the limit @xmath45",
    ", there is no room for genuine cp violation .",
    "the interaction with matter will generate an asymmetry effect , however , which is not connected with the vacuum propagation .    for @xmath1 and @xmath46 , one has    , for different values of @xmath47 . from up to down : @xmath48 = 0.005 , 0.01 , 0.05 , 0.10 , 0.16 and @xmath49 as",
    "all the plots are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis when @xmath50 .",
    "lower panel : charge - asymmetry , a , for @xmath47 = 0.05 ( dashed line ) and 0.16 ( solid line ) .",
    "the lower plots correspond to @xmath51 and the upper ones to @xmath50 . for both panels , @xmath52 km , @xmath53 = 1 and @xmath54 ev@xmath5 .",
    "[ asym],width=377 ]    @xmath55    and it is represented in fig . [ asym ] as function of the energy for a baseline of @xmath52 km and different values of @xmath56 . around the resonance ,",
    "@xmath57 presents a plateau with non - vanishing appreciable values ( depending on @xmath56 ) .",
    "the big asymmetries at 6 and 20 gev correspond to low probabilities and they are not of interest . the negative ( positive ) asymmetry in the plateau is obtained for @xmath58 .",
    "obviously , it is symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis when changing the sign of @xmath3 . as we have seen above , the optimal baseline is inversely proportional to the @xmath59 mixing .    for atmospheric neutrinos",
    ", @xmath57 can not be separated out and the @xmath60 flux also contributes to the detection of @xmath61 .",
    "taking into account the cc cross - sections in the detector ,    @xmath62 \\\\[2ex ] n(\\mu^+;e ) = \\sigma_{cc}(\\overline{\\nu}_{\\mu } ) \\ ; \\left [ \\phi^o ( \\overline{\\nu}_{\\mu};e ) \\ ; p(\\overline{\\nu}_{\\mu } \\rightarrow \\overline{\\nu}_{\\mu } ) + \\phi^o ( \\overline{\\nu}_e;e ) \\ ; p(\\overline{\\nu}_e \\rightarrow \\overline{\\nu}_{\\mu } ) \\right ] \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) are the muon and electron ( anti ) neutrino fluxes , respectively , calculated from @xcite . as in the important energy range ,",
    "both cross - sections are , to good aproximation , linear with the energy , one can build an asymmetry which eliminates what is induced by @xmath67 in the form    @xmath68    in ( [ a ] ) there is still some asymmetry generated by the atmospheric neutrino fluxes .",
    "contrary to @xmath57 , the value of the muon - charge asymmetry is not symmetric with respect to the abscisa axis when changing the sign of @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "[ asym ] we give the values of a for two values of @xmath69 .",
    "there is again an appreciable separation between the cases of positive and negative @xmath3 .",
    "in the limit of @xmath70 , the main conclusions of this study are : i ) the medium effects , which discriminate between neutrino and antineutrino propagation determine the sign of the atmospheric @xmath3 ; ii ) for @xmath71 , electron neutrinos decouple from neutrino mixing in matter and have a definite effective mass in matter ; iii ) for @xmath33 , electron neutrinos mix with the third mass eigenstate neutrino and take part in the atmospheric neutrino oscillations ; iv ) electron neutrinos do not mix with the first mass eigenstate in matter , avoiding the generation of genuine cp - violating effects ; v ) non - resonant medium effects are already apparent in the sub - sominant channel @xmath72 for baselines @xmath73 km , in both the mixing and the oscillation phase - shift ; vi ) the observation of matter effects in the @xmath1-survival probability requires the action of the msw resonance , with baselines longer than @xmath74 km ; vii ) the optimal baseline depends on the value of @xmath25 , but the effects are much cleaner in the region of the longest baselines without entering the earth core @xcite ( nadir angles @xmath75 ) .",
    "the corresponding muon - charge asymmetry shows an appreciable separation for the two possible signs of @xmath3 .",
