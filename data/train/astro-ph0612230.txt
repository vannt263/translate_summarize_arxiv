    "benzene is the smallest aromatic molecule , and is presumed to be a basic building block in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "pahs have been observed in protostellar disks around both low - mass t tauri @xcite and intermediate - mass herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars @xcite .",
    "the number of detections in t tauri - type disks is low , although this is to be expected since the incident uv radiation field is several orders of magnitude smaller than in haebe stars .",
    "models indicate that the pah emission comes from surface layers @xcite , leading to speculation as to whether pahs form in these high uv environments or elsewhere .",
    "both pahs and benzene are also seen in protoplanetary nebulae ( ppne )  pahs in the circumstellar tori and in the bipolar outflows @xcite , and benzene in the torus around @xcite",
    ". however , the processes that form benzene depend on the environment , with different pathways dominating in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , in ppne , in planetary atmospheres @xcite and , as we shall show , in protostellar disks . in this letter",
    "we consider the formation of benzene in a protostellar disk , and the implications this has for pah formation .",
    "the gas - phase synthesis of benzene proceeds via different reaction pathways in different environments , depending on physical and chemical conditions .",
    "one pervading condition for high abundances of benzene is that of high density ( @xmath310@xmath4@xmath5 ) .",
    "several reaction schemes have been suggested for benzene formation :    [ [ the - interstellar - medium ] ] the interstellar medium + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a reaction scheme for the gas - phase formation of benzene was proposed by @xcite following the measurement and calculation of new rates for radiative association reactions .",
    "the formation pathway for benzene they suggested is thus : @xmath6 and variations of the above ( for instance , c@xmath7h@xmath1 may replace c@xmath7h@xmath7 in reaction  [ c6h5form ] ) .",
    "this produces moderate amounts ( @xmath810@xmath9 , with respect to h@xmath7 ) of benzene in a dense ( 10@xmath10@xmath5 ) interstellar cloud model .",
    "[ [ protoplanetary - nebulae ] ] protoplanetary nebulae + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    @xcite applied the above reaction scheme to the dense torus ( @xmath1110@xmath4@xmath5 ) around the protoplanetary nebula .",
    "is rich in hydrocarbons , and benzene has been detected in infra - red spectra of this object @xcite . in the highly ionising environment around c@xmath2h@xmath12 is formed more efficiently via reactions of various ions with acetylene : @xmath13 followed by reactions  [ c6h5form][c6h6form ] .",
    "the models of @xcite produced a fractional abundance of benzene of @xmath810@xmath14 , in good agreement with observations .",
    "the protostellar disk model we use will be described more fully in a forthcoming publication , @xcite .",
    "we use a density and dust temperature profile based on that of @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : denstemp ] ) .",
    "this is a flared accretion disk model , with a maximum dust grain size of 0.25@xmath15 m , similar to the size of interstellar dust .",
    "the disk has a mass accretion rate of @xmath16=10@xmath17m@xmath18yr@xmath19 and a surface density of @xmath20=100g@xmath21 at 1au , whilst the central star has the following properties : @xmath22=0.7m@xmath18 , @xmath23=4000k and @xmath24=2r@xmath18 . using these profiles , we calculate uv photon fluxes throughout the disk with the ray - tracing component of the model of @xcite . this calculates the uv field due to the central star and the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) and also includes radiation scattering effects . at 10au",
    "we assume that the uv field due to the central star is 50,000 times the isrf , in accordance with the observations of @xcite . despite the differing spectral shapes of the isrf and a typical t tauri stellar field , with strong emission lines dominating the t tauri spectrum @xcite , the formation of benzene in the very dense and well - shielded region we consider is not critically dependent on our choice of stellar uv field .    given gas densities , dust temperatures and uv photon fluxes at each point on our grid16au ( radial@xmath25vertical ) grid with spacings of 0.5au@xmath250.02au to model the very inner region of the disk . ]",
    ", we are then able to solve the heating and cooling balance of the gas in a similar manner to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the gas temperature can be underestimated by up to two orders of magnitude if it is assumed to be equal to the dust temperature throughout the disk , although this is less critical for the optically thick midplane region where benzene forms .",
    "figure  [ fig : denstemp ] shows the range of gas temperatures within the inner 3au of the disk ( the benzene formation region ) .",
    "we use a subset of the extensive umist rate99 gas - phase chemical network @xcite , augmenting it with gas - grain interactions ( freezeout , thermal desorption ) and grain surface reactions so that our reaction set comprises approximately 2400 reactions amongst 200 species .",
    "we include species with more carbon atoms than benzene to ensure that chain - lengthening does not result in a spurious build - up of benzene .",
    "we have selected reactions which are valid in the region 10500k ; this upper limit is exceeded in the upper regions of the disk where temperatures can reach @xmath810,000k , although at such high temperatures molecules are destroyed .",
    "hence we concentrate on the portions of the disk closer to the midplane , less than 2 scaleheights .",
    "the model follows the passage of a parcel of gas as it flows inwards from the outer regions of the disk ( @xmath2635au ) , and as such it traces a period in the evolutionary history of the disk . at the outer edge of the disk",
    "the parcel has the composition of a million - year old molecular cloud .",
    "the parcel then accretes onto the central star over a period of approximately 200000 years .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the choice of initial abundances has relevatively little effect on the chemistry of most species .",
    "we find that benzene formation in a protostellar disk is efficient within 3au of the central star , and fractional abundances of @xmath810@xmath14 are achieved inside a radius of 2au ( fig .",
    "[ fig : benzdist ] ) .",
    "the most efficient formation mechanism for benzene in this region is due to the reaction between c@xmath1h@xmath2 and its ion , c@xmath1h@xmath27 , for which the rate has been measured to within @xmath2825% in the laboratory ( @xmath29=7.48@xmath2510@xmath30@xmath31s@xmath19 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) h@xmath2 ; however , the experimental data for reaction  ( [ eq : benzform ] ) was obtained using allene , rather than methylacetylene ( ch@xmath1cch ) or cyclopropene ( _ _ c-__c@xmath1h@xmath2 ) ] .",
    "this is followed by neutralisation of the resulting _ _ c-__c@xmath0h@xmath32 ion in collisions with dust grains : @xmath33 where _",
    "g _ signifies a species adsorbed onto a grain surface .    in this reaction scheme",
    ", the adsorption energy of benzene becomes an important factor in determining the amount of gaseous benzene .",
    "estimates of this vary wildly : comparison of similar species in table  4 of @xcite leads to a value of 4730k , which agrees well with the experiment of @xcite using a graphite surface ( 4752k ) . if one takes the approach of @xcite , and adds the adsorption energy of acetylene to four times the adsorption energy of carbon and four times the adsorption energy of hydrogen , one arrives at the value of 7587k .",
    "this figure lies in the upper range of an experiment on a graphite surface by @xcite . to quantify the effects of these different adsorption energies , we ran one model with a low binding energy of 4750k , and one model with a higher binding energy of 7580k",
    ". results show a significant decrease in the extent of the gas - phase benzene distribution with the higher binding energy , as to be expected , with little change in the peak fractional abundance .",
    "the inner , midplane regions of our disk model are very dense ( reaching @xmath810@xmath34@xmath5 ) , possibly dense enough for three - body ( termolecular ) reactions to have an effect on the chemistry . in order to investigate the effect on benzene production in particular",
    ", we ran a third model including a representative three - body reaction : @xmath35 where two propargyl radicals collide with m , a third molecule .",
    "this has been shown to be a very efficient formation mechanism for benzene when densities are high ; see the discussion of @xcite .",
    "we have adopted a rate coefficient from chemical models of the saturnian atmosphere : @xmath36 @xcite where k@xmath37 , the high pressure limit to the reaction rate , was taken to be 1.66@xmath2510@xmath38@xmath39s@xmath19 and k@xmath40 , the low pressure limit , 1@xmath2510@xmath41@xmath31s@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "inclusion of this reaction in the model did not result in a significant change in the abundance of gas - phase benzene , despite the presence of large fractional abundances of c@xmath1h@xmath1 in dense regions . even adopting the faster rates for k@xmath37 and k@xmath40 from @xcite ( 1.2@xmath2510@xmath30@xmath31s@xmath19 and 6.0@xmath2510@xmath42@xmath39s@xmath19 , respectively ) had little overall effect .",
    "the region in which benzene is abundant in our model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : benzdist ] ) is also rich in other organic molecules : high densities mean fast collision timescales with other molecules and with dust grains , and also protection from the strong stellar uv field in this region .",
    "these prime conditions for the growth of organic molecules may allow molecules to grow beyond the single aromatic ring of benzene into pahs , either by substitution of hydrogen by acetylene in the ring @xcite , or by the dimerisation of benzene ( a@xmath43 ) with successive phenyl rings to produce naphthalene ( a@xmath7 ) , phenanthrene ( a@xmath1 ) , pyrene ( a@xmath2 ) and successively large pah molecules @xcite .",
    "benzene itself is unlikely to persist through to the formation of planets : calculations show that benzene has a timescale for uv destruction in the diffuse solar system of only hundreds of years @xcite , meaning that the benzene seen on jupiter , saturn and titan is unlikely to be primordial .    in order for pahs to form",
    ", the constituents must be present in a region warm enough for ring closure to occur .",
    "pahs only seem to form efficiently at temperatures in the region of 9001100k @xcite and not greater .",
    "production may be possible , too , at lower temperatures ( 700900k ) given a high pressure @xcite .",
    "the region of benzene production is at a temperature of a few hundred degrees , and sits just below a region of sufficiently high temperature for pah formation .",
    "invoking vertical mixing here could raise benzene and other organics into the higher temperature region , as well as push newly - formed pahs into the surface layers of the disk , where they are observed . mixing timescales at a few au are fast enough ( @xmath8625yr ;",
    "* ) to dredge material from the midplane to surface layers within the lifetime of a t tauri disk ( @xmath810@xmath44yr ) .    for pahs to subsist in the solar system , the rate of growth of the pah must be greater than the rate of photodissociation .",
    "however , once a pah reaches 30 - 40 carbon atoms in size , it is effectively safe from photodissociation since at this size the infrared radiative rate of the pah dominates the photodissociation rate . in the ism , a benzene molecule is destroyed ( by removal of an acetylene molecule ) at a rate of 1.5@xmath2510@xmath30s@xmath19 , giving a lifetime of around 200 years . the growth time ( accretion of an acetylene molecule )",
    "is given by @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "inserting typical values for the abundance of acetylene in the inner part of the disk , @xmath46=10@xmath47 , and the reaction rate for accretion of acetylene , @xmath48=10@xmath49s@xmath19 , gives a necessary density of 1.5@xmath2510@xmath50@xmath5 for pah growth from benzene .",
    "this tallies with the low abundances of benzene in ( low density ) interstellar cloud models ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : diffenvs ] ) and the lack of a detection of benzene in the ism .",
    "however , these conditions _ are _ met within the inner regions of a protostellar disk , as has been shown in our chemical model ( which also includes destruction of benzene by reactions with ions ) . in fact , the strength of the uv field drops below the interstellar level for much of the midplane region , and will remain at that level for much of the transition towards a debris disk . assuming a pah of 40 carbon atoms forms solely through the addition of acetylene to a benzene ring , a pah could be produced from a benzene molecule on a timescale of approximately fifty years at a density of 10@xmath51@xmath5 . even though the actual route to pah formation is likely to be different ,",
    "this estimate does give a representative timescale and show that pah production from benzene could possibly be prolific in this type of environment .",
    "we will consider the formation of larger aromatics in a future paper .",
    "having ascertained that benzene can survive for an amount of time long enough for pahs to form from it , the question arises , do pahs form in similar regions to which benzene forms ?",
    "the answer to this is unclear , since the supporting observational evidence is sparse .",
    "of the three detections of pahs in t tauri - type disks @xcite , all three disks are thought to have inner dust holes ( from sed models ) .",
    "thus it may just be a selection effect that pah emission is only detected from the upper layers of disks because of the presence of these dust holes : otherwise the continuum emission swamps any possible pah emission feature originating from deeper in the disk .",
    "further observations are necessary to confirm the correlation between the presence of benzene and pahs .",
    "this research was conducted at the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
