    "in particular , graphene , a two dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb structure of carbon , has been an active field of research.@xcite because of unique symmetry , electron and hole bands of graphene show linear band crossing at the fermi level@xcite resulting in a massless dirac fermion like behavior of charge carriers . as a result , klein paradox ,",
    "an interesting result of quantum electrodynamics was expected to be observed in graphene.@xcite moreover , it was shown that half - integer quantization of hall conductance@xcite can be observed in graphene .",
    "unusual electronic and magnetic properties of graphene , such as high carrier mobility , ambipolar effect , have promised variety of applications .",
    "in addition to some early works on crystalline order in planar structures,@xcite possibility of very large one - atom - thick two dimensional ( 2d ) crystals with intrinsic ripples is reported theoretically@xcite and experimentally.@xcite not only extended 2d graphene sheets but also quasi - one - dimensional graphene ribbons with armchair or zigzag edges have shown unusual electronic,@xcite magnetic@xcite and quantum transport properties.@xcite    all these experimental and theoretical studies on graphene created significant interest in one - atom - thick honeycomb lattices of other group iv elements and compounds of iii - v and ii - vi group elements .",
    "recently , the boron - nitride ( bn ) honeycomb sheet was reported as a stable ionic monolayer.@xcite bn has the same planar structure as graphene with a nearest neighbor distance of 1.45  .",
    "however , its ionic character causes a gap opening at the k - point .",
    "thus , instead of being a semimetal , bn honeycomb structure is a wide band gap insulator with an energy gap of 4.64 ev .",
    "soon after its synthesis , several studies on nanosheets @xcite and nanoribbons@xcite of bn have been reported .",
    "hexagonal monolayer of zinc oxide ( zno ) is a ii - vi metal - oxide analogue of graphene and bn .",
    "previously , works on nanostructures of zno such as nanosheets,@xcite nanobelts,@xcite nanotubes,@xcite nanowires@xcite and nanoribbons@xcite were reported and recently the synthesis of zno bilayer honeycomb structure was also achieved.@xcite in contrast to graphene , zno nanoribbons have ferromagnetic order in their ground state due to electronic states at the zigzag edges dominated by oxygen atoms.@xcite    two dimensional sic honeycomb sheet is another group iv binary compound displaying interesting properties . while the infinite periodic 2d form of sic is a semiconductor with 2.55 ev band gap , and its zigzag nanoribbons are magnetic metals , the armchair ribbons are nonmagnetic semiconductors.@xcite half - metallicity is also predicted for narrow sic zigzag nanoribbons without any chemical decoration or applied external field . furthermore , functionalization of sic single sheets upon formation of various types of vacancies and adatom decoration was also predicted.@xcite     is the distances between these two planes .",

    "buckled honeycomb structure of si was pointed out even in some earlier studies.@xcite surprisingly , in spite of their puckered geometrical structure , si and ge monolayers have electronic band structures which are similar to graphene . as a result ,",
    "linear crossing of @xmath2- and @xmath3-bands at k- and k-points of the hexagonal bz attributes a massless dirac fermion character to the charge carriers .",
    "quasi 1d honeycomb structures , namely nanoribbons of si and ge , also show interesting electronic and magnetic properties depending on their width and orientation .",
    "successful realization of single crystal silicon monolayer structures@xcite through chemical exfoliation shows that 2d silicon monolayers with their low resistivity and extremely thin structures can be quite promising for nanoelectronics .

    "we hope that the predictions of our work will guide further experimental studies towards the synthesis of new materials having honeycomb structure",
    ". the present work , which considers a total of 26 elemental and binary compounds in 2d honeycomb structure and reveals whether they are stable , is an extension to our preliminary work on si and ge puckered honeycomb structures .",

    "the stable local minima of the born - oppenheimer surface for each structure is shown with a dashed line separately.,width=321 ]    graphene has a 2d hexagonal lattice in which c atoms are arranged to form a planar ( pl ) honeycomb structure as shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "accordingly , it has a six fold rotation axis , @xmath13 at the center of the hexagon , which is perpendicular to the atomic plane .",
    "hexagonal lattice has a two - atom basis in the primitive unit cell , corresponding to a- and b - sublattices .",
    "that is three alternating atoms of each hexagon belong to one of the two sublattices . in graphene planar geometry",
    "is assured by the formation of strong @xmath2-bonding between two nearest neighbor @xmath14-orbitals perpendicular to the graphene plane .",
    "the resulting @xmath2- and @xmath3-bands determine also relevant electronic properties .",
    "in addition , there are strong yet flexible , covalent @xmath15-bonds derived from the planar hybrid @xmath16 orbitals between adjacent c atoms .",
    "nearest c atoms are separated by 1.42   and the magnitude of the hexagonal bravais lattice vector is 2.46   .",
    "briefly , the planar @xmath16 hybridization and perpendicular @xmath14 orbitals underlie planar geometry , unusual mechanical strength and electronic structure of graphene .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the variation of the total energy with respect to the lattice constant @xmath17 of the 2d hexagonal bravais lattice .",
    "we see that c and bn stayed planar and have a single minimum .",
    "the situation with si , ge and gaas is different , since they have two other minima corresponding to low buckled ( lb ) and high buckled ( hb ) geometries in addition to planar geometry .",
    "in fact , the total energies corresponding to the minimum of the planar geometry are already higher than those of lb and hb geometries . in buckled geometries , while atoms of a - sublattice are rising , those of b - sublattice are lowered . at the end atoms of a- and b - sublattices lie in different planes having a buckling distance , @xmath18 as shown in fig .",
    "the value of @xmath18 in hb geometry is high and is in the ranges of @xmath19 2.5 , but it is low in lb geometry and ranges between 0.4 and 0.7 .",
    "we note that two minima corresponding to hb and lb geometries in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are seperated by a significant energy barrier . as we discuss in subsection iii.b the minimum of hb",
    "is not actually a local minimum on born - oppenheimer surface .",
    "the six - fold rotation symmetry of graphene is broken as a result of buckling and changes to the three - fold rotation symmetry @xmath20 .",
    "the similar symmetry breaking takes place also in group iii - v compounds having pl honeycomb structures .    in concluding this discussion",
    ", we point out that even if the calculated total energy has a minimum relative to a specific structural parameter , this may not correspond to a local minimum .",
    "then it remains to answer which of these minima in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] corresponds to a local minima on the born - oppenheimer surface . at this point ,",
    "reliable tests for stability of structure have to be performed .",
    "analysis of phonon modes provides a reliable test for a structure optimized conjugate gradient method .",
    "if there is an instability related with a phonon mode with * k * in bz , the square of frequency , @xmath21(*k * ) obtained from the dynamical matrix becomes negative implying an imaginary frequency .",
    "phonon calculations are performed by taking into account the interactions in ( 7x7x1 ) large supercells consisting of 98 atoms .",
    "for all the infinite 2d honeycomb structures there are three acoustical ( a ) and three optical ( o ) modes . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we present the calculated dispersions of phonon modes of various honeycomb structures ; namely group iv elements and their binary compounds , as well as group iii - v compounds . according to these results some materials , for example sn can not be stable in the honeycomb structure .",
    "none of the honeycomb structures are stable in the hb geometry .",
    "only 22 honeycomb structures studied in this paper display @xmath21(*k * ) dispersions , which confirm their stability either in pl or in lb geometry .",
    "well known linear behavior of phonon dispersions of la and ta branches and quadratic behavior of za branch around @xmath22-point also exist for all 2d lattices . among these , the la and ta phonon branches are heat carrying modes .",
    "however , it was shown that bending branch za makes negligible contribution to thermal conductivity.@xcite note that only the za branch gets imaginary frequencies for * k * wave vectors in the vicinity of @xmath22-point in bz .",
    "while this indicates the structural instability for infinitely large periodic structures , it can be taken also as evidence that an infinitely large 2d hexagonal lattice can be stabilized by defects or ripples with large wave length .",
    "our analysis for such systems treated in ( @xmath23 ) supercells showed the existence of ripples . clearly , finite patches of such structures can become stable .",
    "this argument has been confirmed by our calculation of vibration modes of finite size patches .",
    "in our earlier paper@xcite we found that za mode of 2d periodic ge honeycomb gets imaginary frequencies near @xmath22-point of bz .",
    "this situation has been interpreted as the instability against long wavelength transversal waves , which can be stabilized by rippling or by limiting the size of ge sheets .",
    "an extensive analysis of phonon modes in the present study revealed that the extent of the region of imaginary frequencies around the @xmath22-point also depends on the mesh size used in the calculations . decreasing the mesh size may lead to the decreasing of their particular zone .",
    "therefore , a tedious analysis of the right mesh size is required to determine whether or not the imaginary frequency zone of za mode is an artifact of the mesh size .",
    "we performed this analysis of mesh size for ge - lb structure and found an optimum fine mesh size where imaginary frequencies of za mode disappeared .",
    "we also note that since the interatomic forces related with za modes decay rapidly , the numerical inaccuracy in calculating forces due to the transversal displacement of distant atoms may give rise to difficulties in the treatment of za modes .",
    "briefly , caution has to be exercised in deciding whether the imaginary frequencies of za modes is an artifact of numerical calculations . of course , if the presence of imaginary frequencies near the @xmath22-point is a reality , the instability of infinite and 2d periodic structures can be stabilized by finite size or large wavelength ripplings .    calculated phonon dispersion of graphene is in good agreement with previous lda results and",
    "also with reported experimental data.@xcite around 1600 @xmath24 , lo and to eigenmodes are degenerate at @xmath22 point .",
    "in - plane ta and la eigenmodes have linear dispersion around the @xmath22 point .",
    "as it is mentioned in earlier works on 2d structures , out - of - plane za eigenmode have quadratic phonon dispersion in the vicinity of @xmath22-point . here , the calculated value for out - of - plane optical eigenmode zo is around 900 @xmath24 .",
    "existence of strong electron - phonon coupling in to eigenmode at the @xmath25-point and @xmath26 modes at @xmath22 -point is the reason of the kohn anomaly at these points .",
    "therefore , scattering by phonon with the energies that corresponds to these modes can cause noticeable decrease in transmission spectrum.@xcite since force constant decreases with increasing atomic number or row number in the periodic table , calculated vibration frequencies exhibit the same trend .    as a result of symmetry in honeycomb structures of group iv elements ( such as graphene , si and ge ) , zo and",
    "to branches cross at @xmath25 point .",
    "we also note that the zo branch of a binary compound comprising at least one element from the first row falls in the frequency range of acoustical vibration modes . by comparing the phonon dispersions of inn , inp , inas and insb samples",
    ", it is seen that zo mode have increasing tendency to move apart from the la and ta modes with increasing nearest neighbor distance .",
    "however , in all the samples containing first row elements , zo mode is located between the la and ta modes .",
    "these characteristic trends of zo mode exists for all the 2d honeycomb structures .      according to analysis of stability based on the calculated phonon modes , structures which do not contain first row elements occur in lb ( puckered ) structure corresponding to a local minimum in born - oppenheimer surface . through puckering the character of the bonding changes .",
    "different hybrid orbitals underlie the different allotrophic forms of c atom .",
    "while the bonding of diamond structure is achieved by tetrahedrally coordinated , directional @xmath27 hybrid orbitals , @xmath28 and @xmath29 hybrid orbitals make the bonding in graphene and cumulene ( monatomic chain of carbon atoms ) , respectively . in forming hybrid orbitals",
    "one of two valence @xmath30 states is excited to @xmath31 state , whereby a promotion energy is implemented to the system .",
    "however , by @xmath30 and @xmath31 hybridization the hybrid orbitals yield the maximum overlap between adjacent c - c atoms and hence the strongest possible bonding .",
    "this way , the promotion energy is compensated and the system attains cohesion . in @xmath27 hybrid combination one @xmath30 orbital is combined with @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 orbitals to form four orbitals directed from the central c atom towards its four nearest neighbors in tetrahedral directions .",
    "the angle between these bonds is @xmath35 . in @xmath16",
    "one @xmath30 is hybridized with @xmath36 and @xmath37 orbitals to make three planar @xmath16 which are directed from the central c atom at the corners of the hexagons to its three nearest neighbors . for the cumulene @xmath30 orbital",
    "is hybridized with @xmath14 orbital along the chain axis . in this respect ,",
    "the strengths ( i.e. self - energy ) of these hybrid orbitals decreases with increasing number of @xmath31-type orbitals in the combination ; namely @xmath38 is strongest whereas @xmath27 is least strongest . as for the the distance of c - c bonds , it is shortest in cumulene ( 1.29 ) , but longest in diamond ( 1.53  )",
    "in addition to these hybrid orbitals , dangling @xmath31 orbitals make also @xmath2-bonding between two c atoms .",
    "the @xmath2-bonding between two adjacent c atoms in graphene and cumulene assures the planarity and linearity , respectively . in fig.[fig4 ] the charge density of the @xmath2-bonds between neighboring c atoms explains how the stable planar geometry is maintained .",
    "as the bond distance between two nearest neighbor atoms increases the overlap of the @xmath14 orbitals decreases .",
    "this , in turn , decreases the strength of the @xmath2-bond .",
    "this is the situation in the honeycomb structures of si , where the si - si bond distance ( 2.34  ) increased by 92% relative to that of the c - c bond . as a result of weaker @xmath2 bonds in si",
    "can not maintain the stability of the planar geometry , and the structure attains the stability through puckering , where three alternating atoms of a hexagon raises as the remaining three is lowered . at the end the structure is buckled by @xmath18 . through buckling the @xmath16 hybrid orbital is dehybridized and @xmath30 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 orbitals are then combined with @xmath14 to form @xmath27 hybrid orbitals .",
    "while three @xmath27 hybrid orbitals form covalent bonds with three nearest neighbor atoms , one @xmath27 orbital directed upwards perpendicular to the atomic plane form a weak bond with the adjacent @xmath27 orbital directed downwards . eventually , a puckered si honeycomb structure is reminiscent of graphane@xcite with alternating c atoms saturated with hydrogen atoms from different sites .",
    "briefly , puckering occurs as a result of weakening of @xmath2-bonds , whereby the structure regains its stability through tetrahedrally coordinated @xmath27-like bonding .",
    "puckering may be explained in terms of jahn - teller theorem@xcite predicting that an unequal population of degenerate orbitals in a molecule leads to a geometric distortion .",
    "this way the degeneracy is removed and the total energy is lowered .",

    ", the @xmath2-@xmath2 bonding is weakened due to the increasing bond length .",
    "the structure is stabilized by puckering where @xmath16 hybrid orbitals are slightly dehybridized to form @xmath27-like orbitals .",
    "this situation is depicted for si honeycomb structure .",
    "increasing charge density is plotted with colors from yellow ( light ) to red ( dark ) .",
    ", width=321 ]    as shown in table [ table ] , 11 out of 22 honeycomb structures prefer planar geometry , the rest is puckered to regain stability .",
    "there are interesting examples for planar and puckered ring structures : besides bn , planar @xmath39 molecule and well known @xmath40 boric acid planar crystals are other examples for boron including materials .",
    "@xmath41 rings such as @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 have also puckered structures with a crown shape.@xcite another example is planar cyclobutadiene ( @xmath45 ) ; the well known molecule was shown that it lowers its energy when it has puckered ( butterfly ) structure for its positive dianion ( @xmath46 ) . additionally , it was shown before@xcite that puckered shape of cyclooctatetraene @xmath47 takes planar shape for its negative dianion @xmath48 . for the phosphazenes ( @xmath49 ) , while @xmath50 is planar @xmath51 and @xmath52 have buckled shapes@xcite and thus the rule regarding the compounds including first row elements is still valid .",
    "having discussed the general aspects , we now concentrate on the optimized atomic structure and corresponding electronic properties of stable honeycomb structures .",
    "calculated values of atomic and electronic structural parameters are given in table [ table ] .",
    "one notes that 11 structure having planar geometry has at least one constituent from the first row elements of the periodic table ; namely c , b and n. since the radii of these atoms are relatively small , their presence as one of the constituents assures that the bond length is small enough to keep strong @xmath2-bonding .",
    "this explains how the radius of constituent atoms enters as a crucial ingredient in the structure .",
    "the rest of the honeycomb structures in table [ table ] including si and ge are puckered to have lb geometry .",
    "finally , we note that calculated results given in table [ table ] display interesting trends depending on the radius of constituent elements or their row number in the periodic table .",
    "for example , the bond strength or cohesive energy @xmath53 of a honeycomb structure gets weaker as the atomic radii or the row number of the constituent elements increase .",
    "also band gap @xmath54 and lattice constant @xmath17 show similar trends .",
    "honeycomb structure with @xmath16 bonding underlies the unusual mechanical properties providing very high in - plane strength , but transversal flexibility .",
    "we note that graphene and its rolled up forms , carbon nanotubes are among the strongest and stiffest materials yet discovered in terms of tensile strength and elastic modulus .",
    "we investigated the mechanical properties of 22 stable honeycomb structures listed in table [ table ] .",
    "we focused on the harmonic range of the elastic deformation , where the structure responded to strain @xmath55 linearly .",
    "we pulled the rectangular unit cell in @xmath56- and @xmath57-directions in various amounts and generated a mesh of data corresponding to the strains in @xmath56 and @xmath57 directions versus strain energy defined as @xmath58 ; namely , the total energy at a given strain @xmath55 minus the total energy at zero strain . the data is fitted to a two - dimensional quadratic polynomial expressed by    @xmath59    where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the small strains along @xmath56- and @xmath57-directions in the harmonic region .",
    "owing to the isotropy of the honeycomb structure @xmath62 .",
    "the same equation can be obtained from elastic tensor@xcite in terms of elastic stiffness constants , namely @xmath63 ; @xmath64 .",

    "heterostructures of elemental and compound semiconductors generating a 2d electron gas and devices produced therefrom have been an active field of study in device physics in the past decades .",
    "it is expected that the heterostructure of armchair nanoribbons of gan and aln can constitute a 1d analog .",
    "when periodically repeated , this heterostructure can form superlattices behaving as multiple quantum wells or quantum dots .",
    "earlier similar effects have been investigated for the heterostructures of graphene nanoribbons with different widths.@xcite    superlattices of armchair honeycomb nanoribbon structures can be constructed according to the width and repeat periodicity of the constituent segments .",
    "we can label gan / aln superlattices as gan / aln(@xmath91,@xmath92;@xmath93,@xmath94 ) . here ,",
    "@xmath93 and @xmath94 specify the length of segments in terms of the numbers of the unitcells of constituent nanoribbons .",
    "also @xmath91 and @xmath92 specify the width in terms of the number of dimer lines in the primitive unit cell of constituent nanoribbons . by varying the @xmath95 and @xmath30 , we can construct variety of superlattice structures . as a proof of concept",
    ", we consider a superlattice ganaln(10,10;4,4 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . in the same figure we also presented the electronic band structure of constituent gan and aln nanoribbons . upon construction ,",
    "the atomic structure is fully optimized .",
    "resulting energy band structure and charge density isosurfaces are presented in the same figure .        the highest valence band and the lowest conduction band states are flat and they are identified as _ confined _ states . as a result , one can deduce a type - i ( normal ) band alignment since states are confined to the gan part of heterostructure .",
    "one notes that the bandgap of the superlattice in momentum space is different from those of constituent nanoribbons and can also expect that the superlattice band gap in momentum space gets larger as the extension of gan and aln sides increases .",
    "similar confined states can be obtained by constructing aln core and gan shell structures , where electrons are expected to be confined in the core region .",
    "in view of the exceptional electronic , magnetic and mechanical properties of recently synthesized graphene , questions have been raised whether well - known materials in micro and optoelectronic industry can attain similar honeycomb structures .",
    "it is hoped that unusual properties can be attained from these structures .",
    "the present paper examined a large number of materials , group iv elements , binary compounds of these elements , as well as a large number of group iii - v compounds to reveal whether they may form 2d honeycomb structure . for several decades",
    "the bulk crystals of these materials have dominated micro and optoelectronic industry . based on ab - initio structure optimization and calculations of phonon modes we are able to determine 22 honeycomb structure , which can be stable in a local minimum on the born - oppenheimer surface as either 2d infinite periodic crystals or finite size flakes ( patches ) .",
    "our calculations reveal that group iv elements , si and ge , and binary compounds sic , gec , snc , snsi , snge and sige have stable honeycomb structures .",
    "however , while sic , gec , snc are planar like graphene and bn , si , ge , snsi , snge and sige are buckled ( or puckered ) for stabilization .",
    "we also find that all iii - v compounds containing first row elements b , c or n have planar stable structures .",
    "however , the binary compounds formed from the combination of al , ga , in and p , as , sb are found to be stable in low buckled structure .    for honeycomb structures which were deduced to stable , an extensive analysis have been carried out to determine their atomic structure , elastic and electronic properties . while si and ge are semimetallic and linear band crossing at the fermi level like graphene , all the binary compounds are found to be semiconductors .",
    "interestingly , these honeycomb materials exhibit interesting trends regarding cohesive energy , band gap , effective charge , in - plane stiffness , poisson s ratio depending on the row numbers of their constituent elements or their radius .",
    "interestingly , we deduced a relation between in - plane stiffness and cohesive energy among all honeycomb structures studied in this work .",
    "these materials in honeycomb structure have a variety of band gaps .",
    "even more remarkable is that the nanoribbon forms of these materials provide diverse properties depending on not only their constituents , but also their chirality and width .",
    "all these properties are expected to offer number of applications .",
    "therefore , the studies related with their functionalization by vacancy defects or adatoms , their mechanical and spintronic properties , their heterostructures and core - shell structures will open a new field of research .",
    "we hope that the findings in this work will promote the research aiming at the synthesis of these materials .",
