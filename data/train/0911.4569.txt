    "7  aql ( hd  174532 , sao  142696 , hip  92501 ) is a @xmath0  scuti variable discovered in a systematic search and characterization of new variables in preparation for the corot mission [ 1 ] and was selected as the main target of the stephi xii multisite campaign in 2003 . in this campaign",
    "8  aql ( hd  174589 , sao  142706 , hip  92524 ) was used as the only comparison star because there are no other bright stars in the field - of - view ( fov ) of the 4-channel photometer used in the stephi network .",
    "although no check comparison star was implemented in that campaign , by carefully analyzing the derived light curves , differential and non - differential , it was demonstrated that 8 aql is a new @xmath0 scuti variable .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the amplitude spectrum of both stars are not superposed .",
    "three and seven frequency peaks were unambiguously detected with a 99 % confidence level in 8 aql and 7 aql respectively and a possible identification of the observed modes in terms of radial order was performed [ 2 ] .",
    "ccd photometric observations of 7 aql and 8 aql were reported in [ 3 ] .    in the present paper , preliminary result of new photoelectric photometric observations of 7 aql and 8 aql are reported .",
    "the observations were carried out on the nights of june 21 , 22 , 23 , 28 , 30 and july 07 and 08 at the observatorio astrnomico nacional - san pedro mrtir ( oan - spm ) , baja california , mexico . the 1.5-m telescope with the six - channel strmgren spectrophotometer was implemented .",
    "the observing routine consisted of five 10 s of integration of the star from which five 10 s of integration of the sky was subtracted .",
    "two comparison constant stars were observed as well .",
    "the stars were observed for about 51 hr during the whole campaign ( see table 1 ) .       this work has received financial support from the unam under grants papiit in108106 and in114309 .",
    "special thanks are given to the technical staff and night assistant of the san pedro mrtir observatory .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database operated at cds , strasbourg ( france ) .",
