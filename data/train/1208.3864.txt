    "the nonlinear behavior of langmuir waves ( lws ) is a much - studied problem in basic plasma physics from the 1950s to the present . in this paper , we focus on nonlinearity due to electron trapping in the lw potential well .",
    "this intrinsically kinetic effect has motivated theoretical work such as nonlinear equilibrium or bernstein - greene - kruskal ( bgk ) modes @xcite , landau damping reduction @xcite , nonlinear frequency shift @xcite , and the sideband instability @xcite .",
    "important applications of trapping occur in lws driven by coherent ( e.g. , laser ) light , including the laser plasma accelerator @xcite and stimulated raman scattering ( srs ) @xcite .",
    "the latter allows the prospect of laser pulse compression to ultra - high amplitudes ( the backward raman amplifier ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , srs is an important risk to icf @xcite , both due to loss of laser energy and the production of energetic ( or `` hot '' ) electrons that can pre - heat the fuel .",
    "ignition experiments at the national ignition facility ( nif ) @xcite have shown substantial stimulated raman backscatter ( srbs ) from the inner cones of laser beams @xcite .",
    "the current study is prompted primarily by srs - driven lw s .",
    "much recent work has focused on nonlinear kinetic aspects of srs , including `` inflation '' due to landau damping reduction @xcite , saturation by sideband instability @xcite , and lw self - focusing in multi - d particle - in - cell simulations @xcite , vlasov simulations @xcite , and theory @xcite .",
    "one goal is to find reduced descriptions , such as envelope equations , that approximately incorporate kinetic effects @xcite .",
    "our aim is to provide theoretical estimates for when electron trapping nonlinearity is important in lw dynamics .",
    "these allow for self - consistency checks - or invalidations - of linear calculations of lw amplitudes .",
    "this work is therefore not primarily intended to study nonlinear lw dynamics , although we do present vlasov simulations to quantify the onset of trapping in the presence of convective transverse loss .",
    "we consider a single , quasi - monochromatic wave with electron number density fluctuation @xmath8 , and slowly - varying , unitless amplitude @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the background electron density .",
    "we refer to an electron as `` trapped '' if it is within the phase - space island centered about the phase velocity @xmath11 and bounded by the separatrix in the instantaneous wave amplitude , regardless of how long it has been there .",
    "the dielectric response of the plasma depends on the distribution function , and therefore manifests trapping effects only after enough time has passed for the ( typically space - averaged ) distribution to be distorted .",
    "we call such a distribution trapped or flattened , since trapping produces a plateau in the space - averaged distribution centered at @xmath12 .",
    "deeply - trapped electrons have an angular frequency @xmath13 ( @xmath14 defines the plasma frequency in si units ) , known as the bounce frequency , corresponding to a bounce period @xmath15 . in our language ,",
    "an electron is trapped instantaneously , but a distribution becomes trapped over a time @xmath16 . for a process that detraps electrons at a rate @xmath0 , the unitless `` bounce number '' @xmath2 measures how many bounce orbits a trapped electron completes before being detrapped .",
    "our estimates stem from the assumption that nonlinear trapping effects are significant when @xmath4 is roughly unity .",
    "trapping nonlinearity develops continuously with wave amplitude , and is not an instability with a hard threshold .",
    "vlasov simulations presented in sec .  [ s : loki ] of driven lws with a finite transverse profile demonstrate this .",
    "in addition , transit - time damping calculations @xcite show the reduction in landau damping varies continuously with @xmath4 and obtains a 2x reduction for @xmath5 .",
    "bounce number estimates are qualitative and demonstrate basic parameter scalings .",
    "the quantitative role of trapping depends on the specific application .",
    "we consider two detrapping processes : convective loss and coulomb collisions . for a lw of finite spatial extent ,",
    "electrons enter and leave the wave from the surrounding plasma ( assumed here to be in thermal equilibrium , i.e.  maxwellian ) .",
    "trapping will only be effective if these electrons complete a bounce orbit before transiting the wave .",
    "we find the detrapping rate for both longitudinal end loss , which can be important in finite - domain 1d kinetic simulations , and for transverse side loss in 2d and 3d . to quantify the effect of trapping in a lw with finite transverse extent , we perform 2d-2v simulations with the parallel vlasov code loki@xcite of a lw driven by an external field with a smooth transverse profile .",
    "our results are in qualitative agreement with sec .",
    "iv of ref .. that work considered a free lw excited by a driver of finite duration , while we consider a driver that remains on .",
    "we present a unified calculation of collisional detrapping due to electron - ion and electron - electron collisions , including both pitch - angle scattering and parallel slowing down and diffusion .",
    "this relies on the fact that ( see the appendix ) the distribution in the trapping region can be fourier decomposed into modes @xmath17 $ ] for @xmath18 , and the diffusion rate of mode @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "after a short time , only electrons in the fundamental @xmath21 mode remain trapped .",
    "the collisional detrapping rate scales as @xmath22 , since the trapping width in velocity increases with wave amplitude . we discuss two ways to compare the relative importance of detrapping by side loss and collisions , which is complicated by their different scaling with @xmath23 .",
    "our calculations are applied to icf plasma conditions , particularly lw s driven by stimulated raman backscatter ( srbs ) on the nif . transverse side loss out of laser speckles in a phase - plate - smoothed beam is generally a more effective detrapping process than collisions .",
    "the threshold @xmath23 for trapping to overcome side loss decreases with density and increases with temperature , while the collisional threshold decreases with density and slightly increases with temperature . for conditions typical of backscatter on nif ignition experiments , namely @xmath24=2 kev and @xmath25 with @xmath26 the critical density for laser light of wavelength 351 nm , a reflectivity of @xmath27 w @xmath28 produces linear langmuir waves above the side loss threshold .",
    "such values are likely to occur in intense speckles .",
    "we also show that smoothing by spectral dispersion ( ssd ) @xcite is ineffective at detrapping in nif - relevant conditions .",

    "this section presents our overall framework for estimating the trapping threshold , and lays out some definitions .",
    "consider the trapped electrons in a lw field , attempting to undergo bounce orbits .",
    "there is a time - dependent condition for trapping to distort the distribution significantly , even in the absence of any detrapping process .",
    "for instance , if a lw is suddenly excited in a maxwellian plasma , electrons execute bounce orbits according to what we call the dynamic bounce number @xmath29 the time dependence of @xmath30 allows for a slowly - varying wave amplitude @xmath31 .",
    "vlasov simulations presented in sec.[s : loki ] show that trapping starts to significantly affect the dielectric response when @xmath32 .",
    "that is , it takes a finite time for the distribution to reflect trapping .",
    "the early works of morales and oneil @xcite indicate such behavior , where the damping rate and frequency shift evolve over several bounce periods until approaching steady values as the system reaches a bernstein - greene - kruskal ( bgk ) state @xcite .    to estimate the threshold for trapping to overcome a detrapping process , we assume the wave has been present long enough that @xmath33 .",
    "the distribution has had enough time to become flattened , to the extent the detrapping process allows . for flattening to occur ,",
    "an appreciable fraction of trapped electrons must remain so for about a bounce period before being detrapped .",
    "we are interested in the number of electrons in the trapping region , and how long they stay there .",

    "at @xmath42 we take the electron distribution to be maxwellian .",
    "the fact that only some electrons in the trapping region lie within the separatrix ( depending on their initial phase @xmath45 ) is not relevant , since all the detrapping processes considered here are insensitive to the electron s phase in the wave .",
    "that is , the rate at which electrons leave the trapping region is independent of @xmath45 .",
    "the detrapping rate @xmath0 is defined by assuming exponential decay for the trapped fraction : @xmath46 .",
    "we allow for several independent detrapping processes to occur simultaneously , in that the overall detrapping rate @xmath47 is the sum of the rates @xmath48 for each @xmath49th process considered separately .",

    "@xmath0 is independent of @xmath50 for exponential decay .",
    "we set @xmath53 in what follows .",
    "given the approximate nature of our calculation , further refinement of @xmath0 has little value .",
    "in the literature , detrapping processes are sometimes approximated by a 1d kinetic equation with a bhatnagar - gross - krook relaxation ( or simply a krook ) operator @xcite : @xmath54}f=\\nu_k\\cdot(nf_0/n_0-f).\\ ] ] the linear electron susceptibility @xmath55 for this kinetic equation is @xmath56}^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the plasma dispersion function @xcite .",
    "the krook operator relaxes the electron distribution function @xmath59 to an equilibrium @xmath60 , and locally conserves number density @xmath61 .",
    "the above operator does not conserve momentum or energy , although it can easily be generalized to do so . in a 1d-1v system ,",
    "a krook operator can mimic detrapping by transverse convective loss ( a higher space - dimension effect ) or coulomb collisions ( a higher velocity - dimension effect ) , such as in ref .. any perturbation from @xmath60 decays exponentially at the rate @xmath62 , so @xmath63 for such an operator .",
    "this is especially useful for a detrapping process which has @xmath0 independent of wave amplitude ; this is the case for convective loss but not for collisions ( as shown below ) .",
    "srs simulations with a 1d vlasov code and krook operator , and its suppression of kinetic inflation , are presented in ref .. in this paper , we do not use a krook operator to model detrapping , although we do use one in our 2d vlasov simulations to make them effectively finite in the transverse direction ( a purely numerical purpose ) , and to include collisional lw damping in our application to icf conditions in sec .",
