    "observations of precession of neutron stars probe the manner in which the stellar crust is coupled to the liquid interior",
    ". stairs , lyne & shemar ( 2000 ) recently presented strong evidence for precession of an isolated neutron star at a period of @xmath0 d , 500 d or 250 d , with correlated variations in the pulse duration .",
    "the wobble angle of the precession is inferred to be @xmath1 ( link & epstein 2001 ) .",
    "less compelling evidence for precession is seen from other neutron stars .",
    "quasi - periodic timing residuals are exhibited by psr b1642 - 03 ( shabanova , lyne & urama 2001 ) , in association with roughly cyclical changes in pulse duration ( cordes 1993 ) .",
    "quasi - periodic timing residuals are seen in the crab ( lyne , pritchard & smith 1988 ; ade  2001 ) and vela pulsars ( deshpande & mcculloch 1996 ) , though associated changes in pulse duration are not seen .",
    "the 35-d periodicity seen in the accreting system her x-1 ( tannanbaum  1972 ) has been interpreted as precession by many authors ( , brecher 1972 ; trmper  1986 ; ade , galii & calvani , 1997 ; shakura , postnov & prokhorov 1998 ) .",
    "the fluid of the neutron star inner crust is expected to form a neutron superfluid threaded by vortices . above a fluid density of @xmath2 g @xmath3 ,",
    "an attractive vortex - nucleus interaction could pin vortices to the lattice .",
    "vortex pinning in the crust has been a key ingredient in models of the spin jumps , _ glitches _ , observed in many radio pulsars ( , lyne , shemar & smith 2000 ) . in all candidate precessing neutron stars ,",
    "the putative precession is of long period , months to years , which is in dramatic conflict with the notion of vortex pinning in the neutron star s inner crust .",
    "as demonstrated by shaham ( 1977 ) , vortex pinning exerts a large torque on the crust that causes the star to precess with a period @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the moment of inertia of the pinned superfluid , @xmath6 is the spin period and @xmath7 is the moment of inertia of the solid crust and any component coupled to it over a timescale @xmath8 . if pinning occurs through most of the inner crust ( as assumed in many models of glitches ) , @xmath5 constitutes about 1% of the entire star .",
    "though the coupling of the solid to the core is not well - known , @xmath7 can not exceed the star s total moment of inertia , so the precession period is _ at most _",
    "@xmath9 spin periods . hence",
    ", if the long - period periodic behavior seen in the precession candidates really represents precession , _ the crustal vortices can not be pinned . _ in this paper we present a resolution to this puzzle .",
    "we show that vortices initially pinned to the inner crust would probably be unpinned by the forces exerted on them by a crust set into precession . in the absence of precession",
    ", vortices could still pin to the inner crust with sufficient strength to account for giant pulsar glitches .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the dynamics of precession with pinning . in section 3",
    "we calculate the magnus forces on a pinned vortex in a precessing neutron star , and show that the magnus force per unit length is @xmath10 dyne @xmath11 throughout most of the crust of psr b1828 - 11 , nearly two orders of magnitude larger than the minimum force on pinned vortices in vela just prior to a giant glitch .",
    "thus , if we assume that the force / length @xmath12 required to unpin a superfluid vortex is in the range @xmath13 dyne @xmath11 , a consistent picture emerges for psr b1828 - 11 ( and the other long - period precession candidates mentioned above ) : _ the precessional motion itself unpins the vortices and keeps them unpinned_. in section 4 we show that this interpretation makes sense theoretically ; we estimate the force / length required to unpin a vortex in the crust , and find @xmath14 dyne @xmath11 .",
    "we summarize our findings in section 5 .",
    "the problem of precession of the neutron star crust with a pinned superfluid has been studied by shaham ( 1977 ) , alpar & pines ( 1985 ) , sedrakian , wasserman & cordes ( 1999 ) and jones & andersson ( 2001 ) .",
    "we revisit the problem here to emphasize key results for later use .",
    "first , we briefly discuss the role that dissipative coupling between the core liquid and solid would play in precession .",
    "precession creates time - dependent velocity differences between the crust and liquid that vary over the star s spin period .",
    "if the coupling time @xmath15 between the crust and the core liquid is much longer than the crust s spin period @xmath6 , the precession will damp over @xmath16 precession periods ( sedrakian , wasserman & cordes 1999 ) .",
    "coupling of the solid to the core liquid is not well understood .",
    "magnetic stresses allow angular momentum exchange between the solid and the charged components of the core ( abney , epstein & olinto 1996 ; mendell 1998 ) , though this process is not by itself dissipative .",
    "if the core magnetic field , of average strength @xmath17 , is confined to superconducting flux tubes , the crossing time for alfvn type waves through the core is @xmath18 s for a density of @xmath19 g @xmath3 .",
    "the effective coupling time between the crust and core charges can not be less than @xmath20 .",
    "the coupling time between the neutron component of the core and the charges could exceed @xmath21 rotation periods ( alpar & sauls 1988 ) . hence , the timescale @xmath15 for the _ entire _ core to achieve corotation with the solid could exceed many rotation periods .",
    "the core might therefore be effectively _ decoupled _ from the solid as the star precesses , with the crust precessing almost as if the core were not there .",
    "given the uncertainties , we will consider two regimes : complete decoupling of the core liquid from the solid , and the opposite regime of perfect coupling .",
    "to study the precessional dynamics , we approximate the crust s inertia tensor as the sum of a spherical piece , a centrifugal bulge that follows the instantaneous angular velocity of the crust and a deformation bulge aligned with the principal axis of the crust ( alpar & pines 1985 ) : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the moment of inertia of the crust ( plus any components tightly coupled to it ) when non - rotating and spherical , @xmath24 is the unit tensor , @xmath25 is a unit vector along the crust angular velocity @xmath26 , @xmath27 is a unit vector along the crust s principal axis of inertia , @xmath28 is the increase in oblateness about @xmath26 due to rotation and @xmath29 is the _ deformation _ contribution due to rigidity of the crust .",
    "we assume @xmath30 and @xmath31 . for simplicity , we take the crust superfluid to be perfectly pinned along @xmath27 .",
    "the total angular momentum of the crust plus pinned superfluid is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the magnitude of angular momentum in the pinned superfluid . for free precession @xmath34",
    "is conserved , with @xmath34 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 all spanning a plane ( see fig .",
    "the _ wobble angle _",
    "@xmath35 between @xmath27 and @xmath34 is a constant of the motion .",
    "the precessional motion in the inertial frame can be seen by decomposing @xmath26 as ( see , , andersson & jones 2001 ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a unit vector along @xmath34 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are euler angles and overdots denote time differentiation . for small wobble angle",
    ", the motion is given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the precession is a superposition of two motions : 1 ) a fast wobble of @xmath27 about @xmath37 , with a constant angle @xmath35 between the axes , and , 2 ) a retrograde rotation about @xmath27 . in the body frame",
    ", both @xmath34 and @xmath26 rotate about @xmath27 at frequency @xmath42 , the body - frame precession frequency . for an emission beam axis fixed in the star and inclined with respect to @xmath27 , modulation at frequency @xmath42",
    "is observed .    for insignificant pinning ( @xmath43 )",
    ", the body - frame precession frequency reduces to the classic elastic - body result : @xmath44 .",
    "however , for significant pinning ( @xmath45 ) , the precession is much faster , @xmath46 , as originally shown by shaham ( 1977 ) . taking @xmath47 , where @xmath5 is the moment of inertia of the pinned superfluid and @xmath48 is the magnitude of its angular velocity , @xmath49 . if the entire crust superfluid is pinned and @xmath23 is the moment of inertia of the solid only , @xmath50 is @xmath51 for most equations of state , giving extremely fast precession with @xmath52 . if pinning is imperfect , but vortices move with respect to the lattice against a strong drag force , the precessional dynamics resembles that for perfect pinning ( sedrakian , wasserman & cordes 1999 ) .",
    "the angle @xmath53 between @xmath26 and @xmath34 , is also a constant of the motion ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . for @xmath35 and @xmath53 both small ,",
    "these two angles are related by @xmath54 for insignificant pinning ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath53 is @xmath55 . for significant pinning ( @xmath45 ) ,",
    "if the core is decoupled from the solid , @xmath33 can be @xmath57 , and @xmath53 can exceed @xmath35 .",
    "if the entire inner crust superfluid is pinned , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the moment of inertia of the crust superfluid and @xmath60 is the moment of inertia of the lattice . for most equations of state , @xmath61 is about @xmath62 in this case , giving @xmath63 . on the other hand , if the crust and core are tightly coupled , @xmath64 .",
    "we have seen that significant vortex pinning produces a precession frequency that is orders of magnitude faster than the periodicities observed in psr b1828 - 11 and other candidate precessing pulsars .",
    "we now study the stability of the pinned state in a precessing star . when making estimates , we take @xmath12 ( the maximum pinning force / length that the crustal nuclei can exert on the pinned superfluid vortices ) to be constant through the crust .",
    "we begin by estimating @xmath12 from the angular momentum requirements of giant glitches in pulsars . the standard explanation for giant glitches  that they represent transfer of angular momentum from the more rapidly rotating inner crust superfluid to the crust via catastrophic unpinning ( anderson & itoh 1975 )  yields a lower limit for @xmath12 . as the stellar crust slows under electromagnetic torque , vortex pinning fixes the angular velocity of the crust superfluid .",
    "as the velocity difference grows , a magnus force develops on the pinned vortices . if the crust and superfluid are rotating about the same axis ( and therefore not precessing ) the force per unit length of vortex is @xmath65 , where @xmath66 g @xmath3 is the superfluid density , @xmath67 is the quantum of circulation ( @xmath68 is the neutron mass ) , @xmath69 is the distance of the vortex line from the rotation axis and @xmath70 is the angular velocity lag between the crust and the pinned superfluid ( see eq .",
    "[ magnus ] below ) . for a critical value @xmath71",
    ", vortices can not remain pinned .",
    "the corresponding lag velocity is @xmath72 . treating the crust as a thin shell of constant density , the excess angular momentum stored in the pinned superfluid",
    "( moment of inertia @xmath5 ) is @xmath73 .",
    "suppose that in a glitch some or all of the excess angular momentum is delivered to the crust ; the crust suffers a spin - up of @xmath74 , where @xmath7 is the moment of inertia of the crust plus any part of the star tightly coupled to it over timescales much shorter than the timespan of glitch observations .",
    "the glitch magnitude is as much as @xmath75 yielding the following lower limit for the force on pinned vortices just prior to a giant glitch : @xmath76 here @xmath77 rad s@xmath78 for the vela pulsar and @xmath79 is typically observed .",
    "analyses of glitches in vela and other pulsars show that @xmath80 ( link , epstein & lattimer 1999 ) ; we have taken @xmath81 as a fiducial value .",
    "if glitches relax @xmath82 to nearly zero , the above lower limit is an estimate for @xmath12 . by comparison ,",
    "the maximum amount by which the magnus force can increase between glitches is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the crust s spindown rate and @xmath85 is the average time interval between glitches . for vela , @xmath86 dyne @xmath11 .",
    "we now compare @xmath87 dyne @xmath11 , which is sufficient to explain giant glitches , to the magnus forces on vortices in a precessing neutron star .",
    "define a cartesian coordinate system @xmath88 fixed in the crust and centered on the star , and let @xmath89 be the corresponding basis vectors .",

    "the angular velocity of the crust is then @xmath96 , where @xmath97 .",
    "the instantaneous magnus force per unit length of vortex as a function of position in the star is @xmath98 for @xmath99 rad s@xmath78 ( psr b1828 - 11 ) , the inferred @xmath100 of 3@xmath101 and a density @xmath102 g @xmath3 , @xmath103 exceeds @xmath104 dyne @xmath11 at @xmath105 , a factor of @xmath9 larger than the minimum force on vortices before a giant glitch in vela .",
    "a vortex segment must unpin if @xmath106 , or , @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the stellar radius . for @xmath109 and @xmath99 rad s@xmath78 ( psr b1828 - 11 ) , @xmath110 dyne @xmath11 and @xmath102 g @xmath11 ,",
    "@xmath111 is @xmath112 ; only vortex segments in a region of height @xmath113 are not unpinned directly by the magnus force ( see fig .",
    "we next consider whether the vortex array can be in static equilibrium with respect to the crust when only a portion of the array is pinned very near the equatorial plane .",
    "we find that the magnus force on the unpinned segments exerts a torque about @xmath114 which leads to further unpinning .",
    "as vortex segments unpin at @xmath115 , the angle between @xmath93 and @xmath25 will assume a new value @xmath116 .",
    "the value of @xmath117 will depend on how much pinning there is initially , but it will not become less than @xmath35 ( corresponding to @xmath33 becoming effectively zero ; recall discussion following eq .",
    "[ thetap ] ) .",
    "the precession frequency will also be less than before , as there is less pinned vorticity to exert torque on the crust .",
    "if the vortex segments are to remain anchored at @xmath118 , the vortex array must bend under the magnus force exerted on unpinned segments .",
    "the extent to which vortices can bend is determined by their self - energy or _ tension _ , which arises primarily from the kinetic energy of the flow about them .",
    "for a single vortex , the tension is @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the vortex core dimension and @xmath121 is the characteristic wavenumber of the bend in the vortex and @xmath122 ( sonin 1987 ) .",
    "this tension , which is @xmath123 dyne , has a negligible effect on the dynamics if the vortex is bending over macroscopic dimensions .",
    "however , if a bundle of vortex lines bends , the effective tension per vortex is enormous .",
    "a bundle of @xmath124 vortices has @xmath124 times the circulation of a single vortex , and hence @xmath125 times the tension : @xmath126 .",
    "the effective tension per vortex is @xmath127 .",
    "we estimate the angle @xmath128 through which the vortex array can bend by taking the pinning at @xmath129 to be infinitely strong , and seek a new static configuration of a vortex line with tension @xmath130 under the magnus force .",
    "we will find that @xmath131 , so we approximate the magnus force in the new equilibrium as unchanged by the small displacement of the line away from its original pinning axis .",
    "let @xmath132 denote the displacement of a section of a vortex from its original pinning position along @xmath93 .",
    "in static equilibrium , the shape of the vortex in the region @xmath115 is given by @xmath133 let a vortex follow @xmath93 in the region @xmath134 , so that @xmath135 .",
    "integrating eq .",
    "( [ equil ] ) once gives the angle between a section of vortex and @xmath93 of @xmath136 .",
    "the number @xmath124 of vortices that must bend is @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the vortex areal density and @xmath139 is the thickness of the pinning region ( approximately the thickness of the inner crust ) . the longest vortices that pass through the region @xmath140 plane in the inner crust extend to a height @xmath141 .",
    "evaluating @xmath128 at @xmath142 gives @xmath143 .",
    "taking a bending wavenumber @xmath144 gives @xmath145 .",
    "hence , the vortex array is far too stiff to bend over an angle @xmath146 .",
    "this means that the unpinned segments are prevented by tension from assuming a new static configuration in which the magnus force is small _ unless _ further unpinning occurs at @xmath134 .",
    "we now show that further unpinning is likely .",
    "we treat individual vortices as infinitely stiff _ when the entire vortex array is bending_. the magnus force on a vortex exerts a torque about @xmath114 . a segment can remain pinned and in static equilibrium with respect to the crust only if pinning forces in the region @xmath147 can exert a compensating torque .",

    ", we obtain @xmath160 m. pinning in this outermost region of the crust probably can not occur at all , but if it does , the moment of inertia of the pinned superfluid in this small region would be too small to significantly affect the spin dynamics of the star . if the core is tightly - coupled to the crust , @xmath161 is smaller by a factor of @xmath51 .",
    "our estimate for @xmath12 applies in the regions of the crust where pinning is expected to be strongest ; hence vortex unpinning is likely to be more effective almost everywhere else in the crust .",
    "vortex pinning is even more difficult to sustain for precessing stars with higher spin rates .",
    "the pinning strength @xmath12 can be considerably larger than @xmath19 dyne @xmath11 without affecting our conclusions .",
    "for example , a pinning strength as large as @xmath162 dyne @xmath11 gives @xmath163 ( assuming core decoupling ) , again probably preventing significant pinning .",
    "we conclude that @xmath12 in the range @xmath164 dyne @xmath11 is sufficient to explain giant glitches in young pulsars such as vela , but insufficient to sustain vortex pinning in psr b1828 - 11 .",
    "the vortex - nucleus interaction arises from the density dependence of the superfluid gap .",
    "the details of this interaction are uncertain . in the densest regions of the inner crust , where most of the liquid moment of inertia resides , the interaction energy of a vortex segment with a nucleus is estimated to be @xmath165 mev ( alpar 1977 ; epstein & baym 1988 ; pizzochero , viverit & broglia 1997 ) .",
    "the length scale of the interaction is comparable to the pairing coherence length @xmath166 fm , giving an interaction force of @xmath167 dyne per nucleus . above a density @xmath168 g @xmath3",
    ", the vortex - nucleus interaction energy falls rapidly with density and the vortex core dimension @xmath120 increases .",
    "the mass - averaged pinning force is thus smaller than @xmath169 dyne ; we will take @xmath170 dyne as a fiducial value .",
    "below a density of @xmath171 g @xmath3 , the vortex - nucleus interaction becomes repulsive . here",
    "vortices could pin to the interstices of the lattice , but too weakly to play a significant role in the rotational dynamics of neutron stars .",
    "the degree to which vortices pin to the lattice nuclei is a complex problem , but fortunately one where terrestrial analogs can provide guidance .",
    "the pinning of elastic `` strings '' to attractive potentials is a subject of current interest in condensed matter physics , arising , e.g. , in the pinning of magnetic vortices to lattice defects in type ii superconductors .",
    "we follow the general reasoning of blatter et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and danna et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to obtain a rough estimate of @xmath12 for our problem .",
    "our estimate effectively treats the crust as an amorphous solid with random pinning sites .",
    "this description of the solid is appropriate according to recent calculations by jones ( 1998b , 2001 ) , though we believe our pinning estimate to be roughly correct for a regular lattice as long as the vortex does not closely follow one of the lattice basis vectors . in this context , it is important to realize that pinning arises only because the vortex can bend .",
    "if the tension @xmath172 were infinite , the forces on the vortex by nearby nuclei would cancel on average ( jones 1991 , 1998a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the vortex tension @xmath172 were small compared to @xmath173 , the vortex would minimize its energy by adjusting its shape so as to intersect as many pinning nuclei as possible . in this case",
    "the spacing between pinned nuclei would equal the lattice spacing @xmath174 ( @xmath175 fm ) , and the pinning force per unit length @xmath12 would be approximately @xmath176 dyne @xmath11 . for superfluid vortices in the ns crust , typically @xmath177 ,",
    "so vortices bend rather little , and @xmath12 is considerably below @xmath178 , as we now estimate .",
    "the are essentially five physical parameters that together determine @xmath12 : the vortex tension @xmath172 , the pinning force per nucleus @xmath173 , the vortex radius @xmath120 , the nuclear radius @xmath179 and the typical nuclear separation @xmath180 .",
    "the tension of a single vortex is @xmath181 where @xmath121 is the bending wavenumber . for @xmath182",
    ", we expect the value of @xmath179 to be unimportant . while @xmath120 and @xmath179 are comparable in the denser regions of the crust ( pizzochero , viverit & broglia 1997 ) , in the rough estimate we make below we treat the nuclei as points .",
    "we take as fiducial values : @xmath183 dynes , @xmath184 fm , and @xmath185 fm .",
    "if @xmath172 were infinite , so that the vortex could not bend toward nuclei , the typical distance between nuclei along the vortex from random overlaps would be @xmath186 . for finite @xmath172 , the vortex can bend to intersect extra nuclei , but does so only on sufficiently long length scales , due to competition between the attractive nuclear potentials and the elastic energy of the deforming vortex .",
    "call these extra nuclei ( that the vortex intersects due to bending ) the `` pinning nuclei '' .",
    "the pinning nuclei can bend the vortex over a _ pinning correlation length _ @xmath187 .",

    "for @xmath188 of order @xmath120 or greater , the distance @xmath187 between successive pinning nuclei is of order @xmath189 .",
    "the gain in binding energy due to each pinning nucleus is of order @xmath190 , while the energy cost of bending is @xmath191 .",
    "bending to intersect an extra nucleus becomes energetically favorable when these two energies are comparable , giving a pinning correlation length of @xmath192 to calculate the vortex tension , we take the bending wavenumber to be @xmath193 . for a superfluid mass density of @xmath102 g @xmath3 and the fiducial values given above , we solve eqs .",
    "[ [ t ] ] and [ [ lp ] ] simultaneously and find @xmath194",
    ". the binding energy / length of the bent vortex is @xmath195 . the maximum magnus force / length that the vortex can withstand before unpinning is thus @xmath196 , which for our fiducial parameters is @xmath197 dyne @xmath11 .",

    "the above pinning estimate , though crude , shows that such pinning strengths are theoretically sensible .",
    "in the most convincing example of pulsar free precession , psr b1828 - 11 , we have shown that vortex pinning is unstable for a reasonable pinning strength and wobble angle : the magnus force on pinned vortices is sufficient to unpin all of the vortices of the inner crust . in support of this conclusion , we obtained in section 4 a theoretical estimate of the maximum pinning force / length @xmath12 .",
