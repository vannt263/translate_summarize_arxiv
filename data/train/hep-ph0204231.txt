    "over the past few years there has been an enormous interest in models with extra dimensions beyond the 3 + 1 dimensions of the standard model .",
    "such extra dimensions can be large if the gauge fields of the standard model are constrained to a 3 + 1 dimensional brane in the higher dimensional bulk space .",
    "this idea is particularly interesting because it may be connected with a low quantum gravity scale , perhaps only slightly above the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking . in refs .",
    "@xcite such a model was proposed in which the standard model brane is embedded in a bulk space of dimension @xmath0 which is toroidally compactified . because gravity is allowed to propagate in the full bulk space it will look weaker to an observer confined to the brane . by gauss law",
    "the effective four - dimensional planck scale , @xmath1 , can be related to the true 4+@xmath0 dimensional energy scale of gravity , @xmath2 , by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the common radius of all the extra dimensions .",
    "if @xmath4 is sufficiently large @xmath2 can be as small as the electroweak scale .",
    "effectively gravity is weak because the field lines leak into the extra dimensions .",
    "one of the most interesting features of these models is the presence of a tower of new modes for particles propagating in the bulk .",
    "the momentum of particles propagating in extra dimensions is discretised because the extra dimensions are compact .",
    "to an observer on the brane this effectively looks like a tower of new states ( kaluza - klein ) for each bulk particle , with a 4d mass related to the extra dimensional momentum .",
    "the energy spacing between these states is then in general of order @xmath5 which can be very small .    for the graviton",
    "this property has been used to put tight constraints on the possible radii of the extra dimensions .",
    "however , any particle which is a singlet in the standard model could in principle propagate in the bulk .",
    "examples of this are sterile neutrinos and axions .    some authors , for example , have investigated the possibility that right handed neutrinos might propagate in the extra dimensions and that their resultant suppressed couplings to the usual left handed neutrinos could account for the low scale of neutrino masses  @xcite . other authors  @xcite have studied the constraints on such models due to experiment and observation . an alternate approach  @xcite , corresponding to the conventional see - saw mechanism , has also been investigated by some authors . in this approach a higgs singlet , which carries no standard model gauge quantum numbers ,",
    "is allowed to propagate in the extra dimensions and give mass to right handed neutrinos which , for simplicity , are assumed to live on the brane .",
    "recently in ref .",
    "@xcite a model was studied in which the lepton number is spontaneously broken and the associated goldstone boson ( the  majoron \" ) is present ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "this model was used to compute the decay rate for the intermediate vector boson @xmath6 to two neutrinos and the majoron ( denoted by @xmath7 ) or one of its  kaluza - klein \" excitations  @xcite . using the accurately known value of the @xmath6 width  @xcite bounds on the dimensionless coupling of the two neutrinos to the majoron were obtained allowing for any number of extra dimensions and any intrinsic mass scale ( see also @xcite ) . the related neutrinoless double beta decay process @xmath8 has already been treated in a model of the present type  @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of supernova constraints in the 3 @xmath9 1 dimensional theory has very recently been given in  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we use this model  @xcite to compute processes of astrophysical interest .",
    "we first see that when compact extra dimensions are present new processes become relevant and can heavily affect supernovae dynamics .",
    "we then show that supernovae constraints on the dimensionless couplings are by many order of magnitude more stringent than the accelerators bounds .",
    "our findings seem to discourage unnatural see - saw models of neutrino masses still allowed by accelerator bounds .",
    "we summarize in section ii the majoron model extended to the extra - dimensional brane - world . in section iii",
    "we briefly review the accelerator constraints .",
    "the supernovae constraints are presented in section iv . in the concluding section",
    "v we also discuss the possibility of the extra - dimensional majorons to be source of dark matter .",
    "in the original majoron model of chikashige , mohapatra and peccei  @xcite the lepton number associated with massive majorana neutrinos is spontaneously broken . here , the notations of ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath10 and the extra dimensional case will be followed , respectively .",
    "in addition to the usual higgs doublet @xmath11 which has lepton number @xmath12 equal to zero , the model contains an electrically neutral complex singlet field @xmath13 it is required that the higgs potential constructed from @xmath14 and @xmath15 conserves lepton number .",
    "the vacuum expectation values are : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fermi constant and @xmath18 ( whose non - zero value violates lepton number ) sets a new scale in the theory .",
    "the three light physical two component neutrinos @xmath19 acquire majorana masses @xmath20 which are of order @xmath21 with @xmath22 according to the a standard  see - saw mechanism \"  @xcite @xmath23 represents the  dirac - type \" coupling constants for the bare light neutrinos while the @xmath24 matrix @xmath25 represents the majorana type coupling constants for the bare heavy ( or  right handed \" ) neutrinos . assuming the heavy scale @xmath26 to be substantially larger than the energy in play in the following we focus our attention only on the light neutrinos .",
    "the coupling of the majoron @xmath7 , identified as @xmath27 , to the physical neutrino fields @xmath28 in @xmath10 dimensions is : @xmath29 it turns out  @xcite that the coupling constants have the expansion : @xmath30 where the leading term is diagonal in generation space .",
    "it is convenient to express this leading term using four component ordinary dirac spinors @xmath31 in a @xmath32 diagonal representation of the dirac matrices the relevant lagrangian term reads : @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the charge conjugation matrix of the dirac theory",
    ".    the generalization of the present model to the case where the field @xmath14 propagates in @xmath0 extra dimensions has been carried out in detail in ref .  @xcite .",
    "these extra dimensions , denoted as @xmath35 with @xmath36 , are assumed to be toroidally compactified with a radius @xmath37 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that all the radii @xmath37 are equal to the same value @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath38 continues to carry the  engineering dimension \" one as it would in @xmath10 dimensional space - time and via a fourier expansion with respect to the compactified coordinates we have : @xmath39 where @xmath40^{-\\frac{\\delta}{2}}}$ ] and @xmath2 represents the intrinsic scale of the new theory .",
    "each general kaluza - klein field receives a mass squared increment @xmath41 the zero - mass majoron @xmath42 corresponds to the previously studied @xmath10 massless majoron .",
    "the fields @xmath43 are expected to receive a substantial increment from the pure higgs sector of the theory  @xcite and will be neglected in the following .",
    "the intrinsic scale @xmath2 and the compactification radius @xmath4 can be related to each other when assuming in the  brane \" model the graviton to propagate in the full @xmath44 dimensional space - time .",
    "then the ordinary form of newtons gravitation law is only an approximation valid at distances much greater than @xmath4 .",
    "the newtonian gravitational constant ( inverse square of the planck mass @xmath1 ) is obtained   as a phenomenological parameter from @xmath45 considering @xmath1 as an experimental input ( and approximating @xmath46 ) , shows via ( [ planck ] ) that @xmath2 is the only free parameter introduced to describe the extra dimensional aspect of the present simple theory when @xmath0 is fixed .",
    "we expect @xmath47 to be very roughly of the order unity and @xmath48 of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "finally the yukawa interactions of the majoron and its kaluza - klein excitations with the light neutrinos are described by ( c.f .",
    "( [ lj2 ] ) ) : @xmath49 to leading order in the neutrino masses , @xmath50 with @xmath51 the vacuum expectation value @xmath52 ( unless unnatural fine tuning is considered ) is very roughly of the order of @xmath2 , leading @xmath53 to be naturally of the order of @xmath54 regardless of the number of extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "clearly the exact value of this universal coupling crucially depends on the unknown dynamics behind the spontaneous breaking of the lepton number  @xcite .",
    "in  @xcite it has been shown that the accurately known value of the z width can provide information about the coupling of two neutrinos to the majoron . both the @xmath10 dimensional case and the case in which one adopts a  brane \" world picture with the majoron free to experience the extra dimensions have been studied .",
    "bounds on the dimensionless coupling constants were obtained , allowing for any number of extra dimensions and any intrinsic mass scale .",
    "if the uncertainty of the @xmath6 s invisible width @xmath55  gev is roughly taken as an indication of the maximum allowed value for the total width into a majoron and two neutrinos the following bounds on @xmath56 were obtained in  @xcite for @xmath57 : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 for @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "these are much stronger bounds than the one obtained for the model in @xmath10 space - time dimensions which is @xmath62 .",
    "if a technically natural see - saw model is adopted , the predicted coupling constants are far below these upper bounds . in addition , for this natural model , the effect of extra dimensions is to decrease the predicted partial z width , the increase due to many kaluza - klein excitations being compensated by the decrease of their common coupling constant .",
    "we shall see in the following that constraints from supernovae are much more stringent than the ones above .",
    "_ supernova cooling  _ the proto - neutron stars created by core - collapse supernovae are born with core temperatures of 30 - 50 mev .",
    "the main cooling mechanism for these stars is thermal surface emission of neutrinos on a timescale of a few seconds .",
    "the total energy emitted is the order a few @xmath63 erg , with roughly equal amounts in all flavours of neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "this emission has been observed from sn1987a by kamiokande  @xcite , imb  @xcite and baksan  @xcite , all observing @xmath64 events .",
    "the results from sn1987a are compatible with theoretical supernova models and therefore put a constraint on any non - standard cooling mechanism carrying away too much energy , and since majorons from the kk - tower will be produced in the supernova and carry away energy 1987a data can be used to constrain @xmath53 .",
    "this has been done several times in the literature for the 3 + 1 dimensional majoron models  @xcite . for these models ,",
    "only a relatively small band in parameter space is excluded for the following reason : for large @xmath53 the majorons are tightly coupled inside the neutron star , and only escape via surface emission , like neutrinos",
    ". therefore they can not carry away most of the energy and supernovae do not yield significant constraints . on the other hand , for small @xmath53 the majorons",
    "do escape freely , but they are not produced in significant numbers .",
    "the end result is that a band of roughly @xmath65 is excluded  @xcite .    for the @xmath66 models the situation is different because each kk - mode is very weakly coupled .",
    "therefore we are always in the limit where majorons escape freely once they are produced , and do not need to worry about possible surface emission .",
    "a fairly robust constraint on such `` bulk emission '' is the one proposed by raffelt  @xcite , that the emissivity of the neutron star medium should be @xmath67    in the 3 + 1 dimensional case where majorons are strictly massless the neutrino pair annihilation @xmath68 is not allowed kinematically and the most important processes are @xmath69 and @xmath70 . however , in the present case , most of the emitted majorons have mass of order @xmath71 , and the simple pair - annihilation is by far the most important process . the squared and spin - averaged matrix element for this process ( per single kaluza - klein excitation ) is @xmath72 the emissivity per volume of the medium is then @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the thermal distributions of the incoming neutrinos , @xmath76 . doing the integral gives @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a bessel function .",
    "however , we also need to sum over the kk - tower in order to obtain the total emissivity @xmath79 using the rough equality @xmath80 , @xmath81 , this can be translated into a bound on @xmath53 and @xmath2 which is @xmath82 with the following values for @xmath83 @xmath84 in the above , @xmath85 . in all figures we use @xmath86 .",
    "the bounds are shown in fig .  1 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "however , from considerations of graviton emission , strong bounds on @xmath2 already exist  @xcite .",
    "the most recent , and most restrictive , limits are those from ref .  @xcite .",
    "these are shown as the thicker lines in the left part of the figure .",
    "values of @xmath2 in this range are already excluded from graviton emission arguments  @xcite",
    ".    _ old neutron star excess heating  _ when considering graviton emission a much stronger bound on @xmath2 can be obtained by considering the decays of kk - gravitons produced in supernovae .",
    "gravitons have a significant branching ratio into photons and the decays therefore produce gamma rays .",
    "all cosmological supernovae have therefore by the present produced a diffuse cosmic gamma background . comparing this with observations of the diffuse gamma background by the egret instrument  @xcite yields a bound on @xmath2 significantly stronger than found from the supernova cooling argument  @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the tightest constraint comes from observations of old , isolated neutron stars .",
    "most of the kk - modes emitted from the proto - neutron star have masses of order @xmath87 and therefore also relatively low velocities .",
    "this again means that a large fraction ( roughly one half ) of the kk - modes have velocities lower than the escape velocity , and that neutron stars retain a halo of kk - modes with a typical radius of 2 - 3 @xmath88 .",
    "when these gravitons decay they heat the neutron star and can lead to excess surface emission from old neutron stars .",
    "this argument applies equally to kk - gravitons and majorons . for gravitons",
    "it was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to put an extremely strong limit on @xmath2 , @xmath89 tev @xmath90 , 70 tev @xmath91 .",
    "the kk - majorons only decay into neutrinos and not photons . however , the typical energy of the emitted neutrinos is 50 - 100 mev , and the neutron star is not transparent to neutrinos of such high energy .",
    "therefore the neutrinos hitting the neutron star surface will heat it just like photons do .",
    "the surface luminosity of the neutron star at late times should therefore reach a constant level corresponding to the energy deposited by decay neutrinos .",
    "this luminosity is given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the fraction of the total supernova energy emitted in majorons , @xmath94 is the fraction of the emitted majorons remaining bound to the neutron star , taken to be @xmath95 , @xmath96 is the total sn energy , taken to be @xmath97 erg , @xmath98 is the average majoron decay rate , and @xmath99 is the typical radius of the majoron halo , taken to be 2 @xmath88 .",
    "the decay rate for non - relativistic majorons is given by @xmath100 @xmath93 is a function of @xmath2 and @xmath53 , and can be found from the above cooling bound .",
    "the cooling bound , to a good approximation , corresponds to half the total energy being emitted in majorons ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "for gravitons the strongest bound comes from the neutron star psr j0953 + 0755  @xcite , which is the oldest neutron star for which the thermal surface temperature has been measured .",
    "its total surface luminosity is estimated to be @xmath102  @xcite . for majorons",
    "this neutron star also yields a strong constraint on @xmath53 which is roughly @xmath103 with the following values for @xmath104 @xmath105 in all cases this bound is significantly stronger than the cooling bound , just as it is for gravitons .",
    "the bounds are summarized in fig .",
    "however , there is a limit to the applicability of the bound .",
    "the age of the neutron star psr j0953 + 0755 is estimated to be @xmath106 yr  @xcite . if the majorons decay faster than this , they will have vanished already and can not act as a heating source . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : decay ] ) one finds a lifetime of @xmath107 giving a rough upper limit on @xmath53 of @xmath108 , above which the limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : heating ] ) does not apply .     from the supernova cooling bound , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cooling ] ) , for various @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "the bottom curve is for @xmath109 , the middle for @xmath110 , and the top for @xmath111 .",
    "the thick lines at low @xmath2 correspond to the excluded region of @xmath2 from graviton effects . ]     from the neutron star heating bound , eq .",
    "( [ eq : heating ] ) , for various @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",

    "the thick lines at low @xmath2 correspond to the excluded region of @xmath2 from graviton effects .",
    "the horizontal line corresponds to the upper limit of applicability of the neutron star heating limit . ]",
    "another possible problem is that majorons could be reabsorbed when they pass through the neutron star on a timescale much shorter than the age of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "the most relevant process for reabsorption is inverse bremsstrahlung , @xmath112 which is induced via the electroweak interactions @xcite .",
    "since the majoron is a pseudo - scalar one can estimate the rate for this process in the same way as for axions @xcite .",
    "the result is that reabsorption only happens on a timescale much longer than the lifetime of the neutron star psr j0953 + 0755 .",
    "by the same neutrino pair annihilation process as in supernovae , majorons are also produced in the early universe .",
    "this means that in principle one might obtain non - trivial bounds on @xmath53 from considering cosmological production of majorons . for gravitons such considerations",
    "lead to extremely stringent bounds on @xmath2 and the maximum temperature , @xmath113 , of the radiation dominated epoch after inflation  @xcite .",
    "if the fundamental scale @xmath2 is close to 1 tev then the reheating temperature needs to be extremely low , typically in the mev regime .",
    "however , there is a lower limit to how low @xmath113 can be without disturbing big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "detailed calculations have shown that this limit is roughly @xmath114 mev  @xcite .",
    "the number density of majorons in the universe can be found by solving the integrated boltzmann equation @xmath115 which applies to a single majoron mode with mass @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath117 is the number density of the single majoron mode @xmath7 and @xmath118 is the hubble parameter . by summing over all kk - modes of the majoron in the same way as it was done for gravitons in refs .",
    "@xcite , one finds a present day density of @xmath119 requiring that this density is smaller than the critical density , @xmath120 , then yields an upper bound on @xmath53 as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath113 .",
    "however , there is again a limit to the applicability of the bound because for large @xmath53 the majorons will have decayed by the present . for the decay rate given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : decay ] ) and the requirement that @xmath121 one finds @xmath122 assuming that the typical majoron mass is @xmath123 , a fairly good approximation . in fig .",
    "3 we show the contours of @xmath53 corresponding to critical density .",
    "also shown is the lower bound on @xmath2 as a function of @xmath113 from considering the decay of gravitons produced in the early universe . from this argument anything to the left of the thick grey lines in the figure",
    "is excluded .",
    "the limits used are the ones from ref .",
    "@xcite which are the most restrictive cosmological limits , combined with the limits from ref .",
    "@xcite which for low @xmath113 can be more restrictive .",
    "finally , we also show the upper bound on @xmath53 from the above equation . in the case where the line from the graviton bound is to the right of the decay lifetime bound , majorons can not possibly contribute to critical density .",
    "this is seen to be the case for both @xmath109 and @xmath111 , and indeed for all values of @xmath0 from 2 to 6 .",
    "therefore the conclusion is that no non - trivial bound on @xmath53 comes from cosmology , and further that majorons can not contribute the dark matter of the universe  @xcite .",
    "already , gravitons are excluded as a dark matter candidate because if they were to contribute critical density the photons produced by their decay would have been clearly visible .     which corresponds to @xmath124 .",
    "the upper panel is for @xmath109 and the lower for @xmath111 .",
    "the thick line to the right is the lower bound on @xmath2 coming from considering graviton emission .",
    "the thick vertical line to the left correponds to the maximum @xmath53 for which majorons live longer than the age of the universe.,title=\"fig : \" ]   which corresponds to @xmath124 .",
