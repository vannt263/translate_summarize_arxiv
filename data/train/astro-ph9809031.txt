    "until recently there were no convincing observations of brown dwarfs ( bds ) , but this situation has dramatically changed in only a few years . currently , observations of several dozen bds have been reported .",
    "these formerly elusive objects have been unambigously identified in the pleiades ( rebolo , zapatero osorio & martn 1995 ; basri , marcy & graham @xcite ; rebolo et al . 1996",
    "; zapatero - osorio et al . 1997 ; stauffer , schultz & kirkpatrick 1998 ) , @xmath4oph ( luhman , liebert & rieke 1997 ) , as well as in the field ( ruiz , leggett & allard 1997 ; delfosse et al . 1997 ; tinney 1998 ; liebert et al . 1998 ) and as companions to stars ( nakajima et al .",
    "1995 ; rebolo et al .",
    "optical spectra of the coolest bd candidates have shown that they have properties different to those that characterize m - type stars , in particular they do not show prominent tio bands ( kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1998 ; tinney et al . 1998 ) .",
    "thus , it has been proposed to use the term `` l - type '' for stars and bds that are too cool to be classified as m - type ( martn et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "searches for bds in the pleiades open cluster have been particularly fruitful because this cluster offers an ideal combination of young age , nearby distance , high metallicity , low reddening , richness ( over 800 proper motion members ) and compactness .",
    "three recent deep ccd surveys have provided over 50 photometric pleiades bd candidates .",
    "the itp ( international time project ) ccd survey has covered 1  deg@xmath5 in the cluster core using @xmath6 filters and reaching a completeness limit of @xmath721.2 ( zapatero osorio et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "the other two new surveys have been presented by bouvier et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and festin ( 1998 ) .",
    "the luminosity and mass functions inferred from these deep searches suggest that the number of bds in the pleiades could be of order of a few hundred ( zapatero osorio et al .",
    "1997 ; martn , zapatero osorio & rebolo 1998 ; bouvier et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the number density of bds could be similar to that of stars , but they probably do not contribute a significant amount of mass to the cluster .",
    "one of the most important open questions about the imf is whether there is a minimum mass for fragmentation of molecular clouds .",
    "it is important to characterize the properties of the faintest bd candidates discovered by the deep surveys in the pleiades in order to guide the search for even lower mass objects .",
    "l - type objects in young open clusters are especially interesting because they represent very low - mass brown dwarfs .",
    "the most secure pleiades bds are those with kinematic information that supports cluster membership and lithium detections that confirm their substellar status .",
    "the faintest of these bds are teide  1 and calar  3 ( @xmath0=18.8 ) , which have spectral types of m8 ( martn , rebolo & zapatero osorio 1996 ) and masses of 0.055@xmath80.015  m@xmath3 ( rebolo et al .",
    "fainter pleiades bd candidates have been reported by the different surveys cited above . the coolest and faintest bd candidates with published spectra are piz  1 ( @xmath0=19.64 ; @xmath1m9 ; 0.048@xmath80.015  m@xmath3 ; cossburn et al .",
    "1997 ) and roque  4 ( @xmath0=19.75 ; m9 ; 0.045@xmath80.015  m@xmath3 ; zapatero osorio et al . 1997 ) .",
    "we expect that fainter pleiades bd candidates should be cooler , and thus they should extend the substellar spectral sequence into the new l spectral class . in this letter",
    "we report low - resolution spectroscopic observations of three bd candidates identified by the itp team ( zapatero osorio et al .",
    "two of them have very late m spectral types , and the faintest of the three is indeed the first l - type object identified in the pleiades cluster .",

    "we observed roque  25 on november 3 , 1997 , using the lris spectrograph attached to the cassegrain focus of the keck  ii telescope .",
    "the 600/7500 grating with a slit width of 1.5 arcseconds and a binning of 2x2 pixels provided a resolution of fwhm@xmath16.1   , and a spectral range 634.3891.2  nm .",
    "the total integration time was 6600  s. we also obtained one 1600  s exposure of roque  12 in the same night .",

    "the data of roque  25 were somewhat affected by passing clouds .",
    "the telluric water bands are stronger than in the spectra of other targets .",
    "no flux standard was observed in this run because we had to close the telescope due to bad weather .",
    "additional observations of roque  25 were obtained in service time on december 17 , 1997 , with lris at the keck  ii telescope .",
    "the instrumental configuration was slightly different than in the november observations .",
    "the 600/5000 grating and a 1.0 arcsecond slit were used .",

    "lii 670.8  nm was detected in kelu  1 , confirming the detection of ruiz et al .",
    "the spectra of the pleiades objects were quite noisy in the lithium region .",

    "the pew of lii among pleiades bds are observed to range between 0.5 and 2.5  (basri et al .",
    "1996 ; rebolo et al . 1996 ; martn et al . 1998",
    "; stauffer et al . 1998 ) .",
    "our lii pew upper limits are higher than the expected pew for pleiades bds because of the low - resolution and poor s / n ratio of our data in the lithium region .",
    "hence , our non detections do not imply that these objects have depleted any lithium .",
    "the detection of lii in roque  12 , roque  5 and roque  25 should be pursued because it would be a final confirmation of their substellar status .",
    "the position of our program objects in a color - magnitude diagram is presented in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "note that the theoretical isochrone for an age of 120  myr provided by baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) provides a fairly good match to the observed cluster sequence .",
    "it is expected that for temperatures cooler than about 2500  k ( i@xmath11-k@xmath123.5 ) the effects of dust become important ( tsuji , ohnaka & aoki 1996 ; jones & tsuji 1997 ) .",
    "the baraffe et al .",
    "models use theoretical atmospheres that do not include dust opacities ( allard et al .",
    "thus , the agreement between models and observations for the coolest pleiades bds should improve when dust is incorporated into the models .",
    "the pleiades bd sequence is slightly more luminous than the field dwarf sequence as expected from the young age of the cluster ( 120  myr ) as determined from the lithium substellar boundary ( basri et al .",
    "1996 ; martn et al . 1998",
    "; stauffer et al . 1998 ) . in figure  2 ,",
    "the sequence of field m - dwarfs shifted to the pleiades distance ( 127  pc ) and mean reddening ( a@xmath13=0.12 ) is represented with a solid line .",
    "the field dwarfs bri  0021 - 0214 and gd  165b are plotted as open squares",
    ". these objects could be very low - mass ( vlm ) stars or bds depending on their age , which is still unknown .",
    "kelu  1 and the denis/2mass objects do not have known parallaxes yet , and can not be compared with the pleiades sequence as it can be done with the previous two field dwarfs ( tinney , reid & mould 1995 ) .",
    "the location of roque  12 , roque  5 and roque  25 in figure  [ fig2 ] indicate substellar masses of about 0.060 , 0.045 and 0.035  m@xmath3 .",
    "the effects of dust may lead to slightly lower masses according to preliminary computations communicated by i. baraffe .",
    "we should point out that our mass estimates depend on the choice of evolutionary tracks and the conversion between observables and theoretical parameters .",
    "we have used the color - temperature scale that is produced by the theoretical models . in order to test the dependability of our results ,",
    "we have used other theoretical tracks and empirical color - temperature scales with the constraint that they should provide a good fit to the pleiades sequence .",
    "we found that the tracks of burrows et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997 ) lead to lower masses for roque  5 and 25 .",
    "thus , our mass estimates based on the baraffe et al . ( 1998 ) models are probably conservative .    we have estimated the probability that roque  25 could be a contaminating field object ( and not a pleiades member ) using the number density of early - l objects ( like kelu  1 and gd  165b ) found in the denis mini - survey ( delfosse et al .",
    "the number density of these objects is 0.010.005 pc@xmath14 in the solar vicinity .",
    "the number density of m8m9 dwarfs is about 4 times lower ( @xmath10.0024 pc@xmath14 , kirkpatrick et al .",
    "an object like kelu  1 would appear to lie on the bd pleiades sequence shown in fig .  3 if it were at a distance of @xmath190 pc . since the the completeness limit of the 1 deg  @xmath5 itp survey was i@xmath121 , the probability to find one field object like kelu  1 at a distance of 90@xmath85 pc is in the range 25%10% .",
    "moreover , there were 4 objects occupying the same region as roque  25 in the @xmath15 diagram of zapatero osorio et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . hence , the probability that roque  25 is a field object rather than a pleiades member is less than 6% .",
    "we argue below that our spectroscopic observations support indeed that roque  25 belongs to the cluster .    for roque  12 ,",
    "we obtain a heliocentric radial velocity of + 9@xmath16  km s@xmath17 in the reference frame of the star vb10 ( v@xmath18=+35  km s@xmath17 ) , consistent with cluster membership ( martn et al . 1998 ; stauffer et al . 1998 ) .",
    "our spectra of roque  5 and 25 do not not allow us to obtain precise radial velocities because of their low s / n ratio .",
    "another membership criterion is to consider gravity sensitive spectral indicators .",
    "pleiades bds should be typically younger than field vlm stars and bds , and consequently they should have larger radii and lower gravities .",
    "martn et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found that teide  1 and calar  3 have slightly weaker nai doublet ( 818.3  nm , 819.5  nm ) and stronger vo bands than field stars of similar spectral type .",
    "luhman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) reported that the nai lines are much weaker in an extremely young m8.5 bd belonging to the @xmath4oph star - forming association than in field m8m9 stars . in",
    "l - type objects the nai ir doublet becomes very weak because it is not a resonance line . in roque  25",
    ", the nai lines are not detected .",
    "the absorption feature at @xmath1820  nm is probably due to a telluric h@xmath19o band ( figure  1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "l - type objects develop extremely broad ki resonance doublets ( 766.5  nm , 766.9  nm ; martn et al .",
    "1997 ; tinney et al .",
    "spectral synthesis calculations ( pavlenko 1997 ; haushchildt 1998 ) show that the breath and strength of the ki doublet is very sensitive to gravity and temperature .",
    "the ki lines become narrower and weaker for lower gravity and/or higher temperature .",
    "we have found that the ki doublet in roque  25 is indeed weaker and narrower than in the field vlm star bri  0021 - 0214 .",
    "the pews measured with respect to the pseudocontinuum at @xmath1780  nm are given in table  1 .",
    "due the large breath of the two ki lines , their wings are blended and hence we measured the pew of the whole doublet . the spectrum of roque  25 is quite similar to that of the bd kelu  1 ( ruiz et al .",
    "1997 ) , as might be expected from their similar @xmath20 colors ( table  1 ) . however , some differences are clear ( figure  1 ) .",
    "roque  25 has weaker ki doublet and stronger vo bands .",
    "we conclude that roque  25 must have lower gravity than bri  0021 - 0214 and kelu  1 and hence it is a younger , lower mass object .",
    "thus , the gravity sensitive features in the spectrum of roque  25 strongly support its membership to the young pleiades cluster .",
    "the optical spectrum of roque  25 is characterized by the following features : i ) the lack of strong molecular absorption bandheads in the range 640  nm760  nm , in particular , the strong tio bands starting at 705.0  nm that are conspicuous in roque  12 and can still be seen in roque  5 , are absent or extremely weak in roque  25 ; ii )",
    "the molecular systems of cah , crh and feh become as strong or stronger than the systems of tio and vo ; iii ) the atomic lines of ki and csi that are very strong in l - type objects ( ruiz et al . 1997 ; martn et al . 1997 ; tinney et al . 1997 , 1998 ) are weaker in roque  25 . using the models of baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the photometry of zapatero osorio et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we infer t@xmath22350  k and 2050  k for roque  5 and roque  25 , respectively .",
    "the transition from m to l has to take place at a temperature slightly below that of roque  5 .",
    "pleiades bds with t@xmath21 intermediate between roque  5 and 25 should exist ( the itp , not and cfht surveys have revealed a few candidates ) , and we expect that they will have a spectral type around l0 and t@xmath22200  k. the temperature of roque  25 estimated from the evolutionary models is warmer than the t@xmath21 of 1900  k obtained by ruiz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for kelu  1 , consistent with the bluer i - k color of roque  25 ( table  1 ) .",
    "consequently , roque  25 should be assigned a slightly earlier l - type subclass than kelu  1 .",
    "the calibration of the l - type temperature scale will have to await systematic observations of a large number of l - type objects and a good understanding of their atmospheres .",
    "we emphasize that the pleiades bds are very useful for calibrating the l - type class because the differences along the cluster spectral sequence should depend on mass and t@xmath21 , with age and metallicity being approximately constant ( this is by no means the case for field objects ) .",
    "the chromospheric activity diminishes with decreasing mass along the pleiades sequence .",
    "roque  5 and 25 do not show strong h@xmath10 emission , consistent with the trend of decreasing chromospheric activity for decreasing temperature observed among pleiades vlm members ( zapatero osorio et al .",
    "the same tendency is also present among field very late - m dwarfs ( basri & marcy 1995 ) .",
    "l - type field dwarfs do not usually have strong h@xmath10 emission ( martn et al . 1997 ; tinney et al . 1998 ) , although some exceptions do exist ( liebert et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the lack of strong h@xmath10 emission in roque  25 indicates that l - type objects are not very active even when they are quite young .    in this work",
    "the pleiades spectral sequence has been extended from the coolest m - types ( roque  4 , roque  5 , piz  1 ) , to the beginning of the l - type class ( roque  25 ) .",
    "we have found that roque  25 has photometric and spectroscopic properties supporting that it is a pleiades l - type brown dwarf .",
    "the discovery of roque  25 indicates that the cluster imf extends to masses as low as @xmath10.035  m@xmath3 .",
    "very deep surveys should address the problem of whether there is a lower mass cutoff of the imf .",
    "the minimum mass for bd - formation could be close to the deuterium burning mass limit ( @xmath10.012  m@xmath3 ; cf .",
    "burrows et al .",
    "1997 ) , as suggested by estimates of the minimum fragmentation scale of molecular clouds .",
    "the large @xmath20 color of roque  25 indicates that near - ir large format cameras or mosaics would be advantageous to extend the pleiades bd sequence to extremely low - mass objects .",
    "future surveys should be sensitive to late l - type objects like those found in the field ( delfosse et al .",
    "1997 ; liebert et al . 1998",
    "; kirkpatrick et al . 1998 ) .",
    "l - type objects in the pleiades would generally be less massive than their field counterparts because they are younger .",

    "<S> we classify roque  25 as an early l - type brown dwarf . using current theoretical evolutionary tracks we estimate that the transition from m - type to l - type in the pleiades ( age@xmath1120  myr ) takes place at t@xmath22200  k or m@xmath10.04m@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> roque  25 is a benchmark brown dwarf in the pleiades because it is the first known one that belongs to the l - type class . </S>",
    "<S> it provides evidence that the imf extends down to about 0.035m@xmath3 , and serves as a guide for future deep searches for even less massive young brown dwarfs .    </S>",
