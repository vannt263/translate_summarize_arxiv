    "plasma heating is essential for reaching appropriate fusion temperatures in tokamak plasmas , but as a side effect global modes can become unstable by converting particle kinetic energy into collective kinetic energy .",
    "the energetic particle ( ep ) population produced in the process of heating together with the alpha particles produced in fusion reactions are important actors in this chain , driving plasma oscillations unstable via resonant wave - particle interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "the plasma instabilities such as alfvn eigenmodes ( ae ) can redistribute the ep population making the plasma heating less effective , and leading to additional loads on the walls  @xcite .",
    "typically , tokamak plasmas are turbulent plasmas .",
    "thereby , turbulence adds one more level of difficulty to the ep - redistribution problem , where wave - wave nonlinear interaction of turbulent and zonal modes with ae competes with wave - particle nonlinear saturation mechanisms of ae . for these reasons ,",
    "it is important to have a proper selfconsistent theoretical framework to understand the aes instability threshold in present tokamaks and predict it in future fusion reactors .",
    "nemorb  @xcite is the project of development of an electromagnetic , multi - species version of the nonlinear gyrokinetic particle - in - cell ( pic ) code orb5  @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian formulation that is used , is based on the gyrokinetic gk vlasov - maxwell equations of sugama , brizard and hahm  @xcite . due to the method of derivation of the gk vlasov - maxwell equations from a discretized lagrangian",
    ", the symmetry properties of the starting lagrangian are passed to the vlasov - maxwell equations , and the conservation theorem for the energy is automatically satisfied  @xcite . as a consequence , this model can be adopted in principle for rigorous nonlinear electromagnetic simulations of global instabilities in the presence of ep and turbulence , where all nonlinearities are treated on the same footing in a self - consistent way . furthermore , a pic formulation offers a fine discretization in v - space `` for free '' , which is crucial for studying the wave - particle interaction in the narrow layers around the resonances in phase - space .    when trying to solve the vlasov - maxwell set of equations in a @xmath0 formulation with a @xmath1 pic method , one faces a numerical problem called `` cancellation problem ''  @xcite .",
    "this arises in particular in the numerical resolution of the ampre s equation , i.e. in the equation for the vector potential .",
    "one term of this equation , namely the current integral , has to be calculated with a discretization in terms of macro - particles , i.e. markers , whereas the other terms are calculated directly as analytic integrals in phase - space ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) . due to fact that the statistical error affects only the term discretized with markers , the balance between these terms is not satisfied , and the result is a numerical error which can be orders of magnitude higher than the desired signal .",
    "a brute - force solution to the cancellation problem is the drastic increase in the number of markers , which in turn would make electromagnetic pic simulations unpractical .",
    "a smart solution has been proposed as a split of the adiabatic and nonadiabatic parts of the electron distribution function , where only the physically relevant one , i.e. the nonadiabatic part , is discretized with markers , whereas the adiabatic part ( which is dominant in absolute value ) can be calculated directly by means of an adjustable control variate  @xcite .",
    "this scheme has been found to greatly mitigate the cancellation problem , making electromagnetic pic simulations feasible , with a reasonable number of markers .",
    "recently , the control - variate scheme has been implemented also in nemorb  @xcite , making the investigation of the dynamics of shear alfvn waves ( saw ) possible , for linear and nonlinear simulations .",
    "furthermore , a split of the vector potential into symplectic and hamiltonian parts can be performed , and only the hamiltonian part has to be calculated selfconsistently with the vlasov - maxwell system of equations , whereas the symplectic part can be evaluated with alternative methods ( for example by imposing the ideal mhd ohm s law , which is valid for incompressible saw to the leading order )  @xcite .",
    "this new `` pullback '' scheme , which further helps in strongly mitigating the cancellation problem , is also considered as one of the next numerical improvements to be done in nemorb .",
    "nemorb has been recently verified and benchmarked in electrostatic mode for linear dynamics of global instabilities driven by ep  @xcite , but a detailed verification and investigation of the linear dynamics of alfvn instabilities has not yet been done with this code .",
    "this is a necessary step in the direction of performing a trustable study of the richer nonlinear dynamics of alfvn modes in the presence of turbulence and zonal flows . in this paper , we firstly describe a verification and benchmark effort of nemorb on alfvn instabilities driven by ep .",
    "secondly , we investigate the effect of the continuum on the radial structure of alfvn modes , finding that the radial symmetry is broken , when the mode frequency lies outside the continuum gaps .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in section  [ sec : model ] we describe the model equations of nemorb and derive the local dispersion relation of saw , which constitutes the continuous spectrum .",
    "the continuous spectrum is the frequency , varying continuously in space , where alfvn instabilities are damped due to continuum damping  @xcite . generally speaking",
    ", the continuous spectrum does not exist in pure kinetic theory .",
    "but there exists a nearly dense spectrum of modes that behaves as a continuum when one considers their cumulative impact on a given oscillation , with assigned frequency and wave - vector  @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the derivation of the continuum in the incompressible ideal mhd limit , by neglecting the effect of the ep .",
