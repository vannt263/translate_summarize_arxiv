    "consider a fiber bundle  @xmath11 with fibers @xmath12 , where @xmath13 are closed oriented surfaces of genus @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "it is an elementary fact that euler characteristic multiply for fiber bundles i.e. euler characteristic of total space is the product of euler characteristics of base and fiber .",
    "it was proved by chern et al .",
    "@xcite that the multiplicative formula holds for signature if the fundamental group of base acts trivially on the cohomology ring of fiber .",
    "later , atiyah @xcite and independently kodaira @xcite gave examples of surface bundles over surfaces with non - zero signature thus implying multiplication formula does not hold for signature in general .",
    "recently , many examples of surface bundles with non - zero signature were constructed ( see e.g @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) .    in this paper we present a new construction of surface bundles with non - zero signature .",
    "our construction uses a recent result of fintushel - stern on lefschetz fibration structure on knot surgered elliptic surfaces @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the author would like to thank ronald stern for many helpfull discussions and encouragment .",
    "first we recall the definition of lefschetz fibrations @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 be a compact , connected , oriented smooth four manifold and @xmath18 be a compact , oriented , smooth 2-manifold . a smooth map @xmath19 is called a lefschetz fibration",
    "if @xmath20 is surjective and for each critical point @xmath21 of @xmath20 there is a local complex coordinate chart @xmath22 on @xmath17 around @xmath21 and @xmath23 on @xmath24 around @xmath25 compatible with the orientation , and such that @xmath26 .",
    "it follows from the sard s theorem that @xmath20 will be a smooth fiber bundle away from finitely many critical points @xmath27 .",
    "the genus of the regular @xmath18 fiber is defined to be the genus of the lefschetz fibration .",
    "if a fiber passes through critical point set @xmath27 then it is called a singular fiber .",
    "a singular fiber can be described by its monodromy , an element of the mapping class group @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the genus of lefschetz fibration .",
    "this element is a right handed dehn twist along a simple closed curve on @xmath18 , called vanishing cycle .",
    "if this curve is a nonseparating curve , then the singular fiber is called nonseparating , otherwise it is called separating . in this paper",
    "we will only consider lefschetz fibrations over @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 and @xmath32 be two genus @xmath29 lefschetz fibrations .",
    "they are called equivalent if they have the same number of singular fibers and the fibers are all of nonseparating type",
    ".    the following gluing technique of two lefschetz fibrations will be used in our construction of surface bundles .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the generalization of the statement below .",
    "if @xmath31 and @xmath33 are two equivalent genus @xmath29 lefschetz fibrations with @xmath34 number of singular fibers , then their difference @xmath35 is a surface bundle of genus @xmath29 over the surface @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 and @xmath38 are two equivalent lefschetz fibrations over @xmath30 .",
    "denote the critical values of these fibrations as @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "fix an orientation and the fiber - preserving diffeomorphism @xmath41 between the boundaries of tubular neighborhoods of the fibers with the same index .",
    "next glue @xmath42 to @xmath43 using the diffeomorphisms @xmath41 @xmath44 and denote the resulting manifold as @xmath45 . by reversing the orientation on @xmath38 ,",
    "the gluing map becomes orientation - reversing and the manifold @xmath35 obtains a natural orientation .",
    "notice that @xmath45 will be @xmath46 bundle without any singular fiber and with base @xmath18 . by simple computation @xmath47 and by novikov additivity @xmath48 .",
    "to construct our surface bundles with non - zero signature we will use the family of knot surgered homotopty elliptic surfaces @xmath49 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a family of knot surgered elliptic surfaces @xmath49 are constructed by knot surgery from simply connected , minimally elliptic surface @xmath50 without multiple fibers and of holomorphic euler characteristic @xmath51 . if @xmath52 is a nontrivial fibered knot , then @xmath16 admits symplectic structure .",
    "first , recall that elliptic surface @xmath50 can be discribed as the double branched cover of @xmath53 where branch set @xmath54 is the union of four disjoint copies of @xmath55 and @xmath56 disjoint copies of @xmath57 .",
    "the branch cover has @xmath58 singular points corresponding to number of intersection of horizontal and vertical lines in the branch set @xmath54 . after desingularizing the above singular manifold , one obtains @xmath50 .",
    "the horizontal and vertical fibrations of @xmath53 pull back to give fibrations of @xmath50 over @xmath59 .",
    "a generic fiber of the vertical fibration is the double cover of @xmath60 , branched over @xmath9 points .",
    "thus a generic fiber will be a torus and the fibration is an elliptic fibration on @xmath50 . the generic fiber of the horizontal fibration is the double cover of @xmath60 , branched over @xmath56 points , which is a genus @xmath61 fibration on @xmath50 .",
    "this fibration has @xmath9 singular fibers which corresponds to preimages of the four copies of @xmath62 s in the branch set together with the spheres of self - intersection @xmath63 comming from the desingularization . notice that the generic fiber of the horizontal fibration @xmath64 intersects a generic fiber @xmath65 of the elliptic fibration in two points .",
    "let @xmath52 be a fibered knot of genus @xmath29 , and @xmath65 be a generic torus fiber @xmath65 of @xmath50 .",
    "then the knot surgererd elliptic surface is a manifold @xmath66 where each normal @xmath67-disk to @xmath65 is replaced by a fiber of the fibration of @xmath68 over @xmath69@xcite . since @xmath65 intersects each generic horizontal fiber twice , a horizontal fibration @xmath70 will be of genus @xmath71 .",
    "+ below we state two theorems of fintushel - stern that we use in section 4 .",
    "+    @xcite if @xmath52 is a fibered knot whose fiber has genus @xmath29 , then @xmath16 admits a locally holomorphic fibration ( over @xmath59 ) of genus @xmath71 which has exactly four singular fibers .",

    "@xcite for @xmath72 , the genus @xmath71 lefschetz fibrations , described above , on the manifolds @xmath16 have irreducible singular fibers .",
    "the number of the singular fiberes of this lefschetz fibration can be computed by formula @xmath73 , where @xmath34 is the number of the singular fibers and @xmath65 is a regular fiber .",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath45 be closed , oriented , smooth 4-manifolds containing a smoothly embedded surface @xmath18 of genus @xmath74 .",
    "assume @xmath18 represents a homology of infinite order and has self - intersection zero , so that there exist a tubular neighborhood , say @xmath75 in @xmath17 and @xmath45 .",
    "using an orientation - reversing , fiber - preserving diffeomorphism @xmath76 we can glue @xmath77 and @xmath78 along @xmath79 using map @xmath80 . this new oriented smooth manifold @xmath81 called the fiber sum of @xmath17 and @xmath45 along @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath45 be closed , oriented , smooth 4-manifolds containing an embedded surface @xmath18 of square zero",
    ". then @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath29 is genus of surface @xmath18 and @xmath84 .",

    "in this section we describe our construction of surface bundles .",
    "the main result is summarized by the following theorem .      in @xcite gurtas",
    "presented the positive dehn twist expression for a new set of involutions in the mapping class group @xmath96 of a compact , closed , oriented 2-dimensional surface @xmath97 by gluing the horizontal involution on a surface @xmath98 and the vertical involution on a surface @xmath99 , where @xmath14 is even .",
    "let @xmath100 be the horizontal involution on the surface @xmath97 as given in figure 1 . according to gurtas @xcite the involution @xmath100",
    "can be expressed as a product of positive dehn twists .",
    "let @xmath101 denote the total space of the lefschetz fibration defined by the word @xmath102 in the mapping class group @xmath96 .",
    "the manifold @xmath101 has a genus @xmath103 lefschetz fibration over @xmath30 with @xmath104 singular fiberes and the vanishing cycles all are about nonseperating curves @xcite .",
    "the euler characteristic of the @xmath9 manifold @xmath105 can be computed using the following formula @xmath106 . according to the @xcite @xmath107 . using the formulas @xmath87 , @xmath88",
    ", we have  @xmath108 and  @xmath109 .",
    "the family of manifolds @xmath101 will be the first building block in our construction of surface bundles with non - zero signature .",
    "these manifolds lie on @xmath110 lines , lines parallel to @xmath111 ( see figure 2 , 3 )",
    ".    the second building block in our construction will be the family of knot surgered elliptic surfaces @xmath16 which were discussed in section 2 .",
    "according to theorem 2.2 , these manifolds have lefschetz fibrations over @xmath60 with nonseparating vanishing cycles .",
    "choose the manifold @xmath37 from the first family which is on some line from the family @xmath112 .",
    "notice that the manifolds that lie on lines @xmath113 have euler characteristic equal to @xmath114 . by choosing the suitable values for @xmath115 and @xmath14",

    "denote the @xmath118 of the 4-manifold @xmath37 as @xmath119 ( see figure 3 ) . using theorem 2.1",
    ", we can increase the genus of the fiber by performing knot surgery .",
    "thus we can obtain a manifold of the form @xmath120 with a lefschetz fibration of the same genus as of @xmath37 . notice that these lefschetz fibrations will be equivalent , i.e. have the same genus and an equal number of nonseparating singular fibers .",
    "next we glue @xmath37 and @xmath38 using lemma 2.1 to get our surface bundles over surfaces .",

    "notice that by interchanging @xmath37 and @xmath38 , one can also obtain the surface bundles with signature @xmath124 .    to find such pairs of manifolds @xmath37 and @xmath38 , one needs to look for the common solutions of the system of equations  @xmath125 ,  @xmath126 ( where @xmath115 , @xmath117 , @xmath29 , and @xmath14 all are positive integers ) .    from the above system of equations it follows that the manifolds @xmath37 and @xmath38 lie at lattice points @xmath127 and @xmath128",
