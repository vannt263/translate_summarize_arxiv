    "<S> , we have @xmath15 with @xmath16 and the dissipation strength @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent @xmath18 is responsible for different bath with super - ohmic bath @xmath191 , ohmic bath @xmath201 and sub - ohmic bath @xmath211 .    </S>",
    "<S> the local field @xmath4 introduces asymmetry in the model , which was considered to be less important than the tunneling @xmath5 and thereby sometimes neglected for convenience of treatments . </S>",
    "<S> for the ohmic dissipation , it was mentioned @xcite that the sbm has a delocalized and a localized zero temperature phase , separated by a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition in the case of @xmath22 . in the delocalized phase , </S>",
    "<S> realized at small dissipation strength @xmath17 , the non - degenerate ground state behaves like a damped tunneling particle . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for large @xmath17 , the dissipation leads to a localization of the particle in one of the two @xmath2 eigenstates , implying a doubly degenerate ground state . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , intensive studies have recently been paid on the sub - ohmic dissipation , which also demonstrated the qpt between localized and delocalized phases @xcite . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the qpt could also happen in the absence of the local field ( @xmath22 ) @xcite from a non - degenerate ground state with zero magnetization below a critical coupling to a twofold - degenerate ground state with finite magnetization for a coupling larger than the critical value . </S>",
    "<S> the qpt has been found so far by different numerical studies , such as numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) technique @xcite , quantum monte carlo @xcite , the exact diagonalization @xcite , the density matrix renormalization group approach @xcite , and variational matrix product state approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> analytical studies , such as unitary transformation method @xcite , were also employed . </S>",
    "<S> the latest work by variational method also showed the appearance of the qpt between delocalization and localization @xcite in the case of @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> concentrating on the sbm without the local field , we argue in the present work no possibility with the qpt happening between the localized and delocalized phases in above dissipative cases , opposite to previous results . </S>",
    "<S> the main behavior of the model could be characterized by the parity keeping or breaking , rather than the qpt , owned by the ground state in the variation of some characteristic parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable feature of our treatment is the analytical investigation , which is independent of the bath type , the degrees of freedom of the bath and the calculation precision . </S>",
    "<S> the key step of our treatment is the decomposition of the special sbm hamiltonians in such case into two decoupled sub - hamiltonians , and the key point is the focus on the parity of the ground state of the model . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the significant changes regarding the ground state of the model , if can be called qpt , happen only when the parity breaks down , corresponding to appearance of the local field . </S>",
    "<S> our investigation of the magnetization analytically indicates that the qpt discussed previously by different numerical studies is due to unreasonable treatment of the ground state and/or of the infrared divergence inherently existing in the spectral functions for ohmic and sub - ohmic dissipations .    </S>",
    "<S> we get started from the special sbm with zero local field . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , we denote the hamiltonian @xmath23 by @xmath24 with @xmath25 and introduce a parity operator @xmath26 to commute with @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath27=0 $ ] . moreover , by introducing a unitary transformation @xmath28 we may diagonalize @xmath24 to be two decoupled sub - hamiltonians , @xmath29 where @xmath30 , \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> since no local unitary transformation can change the eigenvalues , the ground state of @xmath24 should be the lower one of the ground states of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    for the eigensolutions @xmath34 and @xmath35 </S>",
    "<S> , it is easy to prove that the eigenfunctions are , respectively , of even - parity and odd - parity with respect to the parity operator @xmath2 since @xmath36 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , @xmath38 is actually the parity operator of @xmath24 after the unitary transformation @xmath39 has been performed , which means that @xmath24 also consists of two sub - hamiltonians with the eigenfunctions of even - parity and odd - parity , respectively , with respect to the parity operator @xmath40 .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath52 where @xmath53 is given by @xcite @xmath54 with @xmath55}(-1)^{j}\\frac{\\sqrt{m_{k}!n_{k}!}(2q_{k})^{m_{k}+n_{k}-2j}}{(m_{k}-j)!(n_{k}-j)!j!}.\\ ] ] so the prefactor @xmath56 , relevant to @xmath53 and the tunneling terms , plays a crucial role in the sbm and should be non - zero . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise the sbm in our case is physically meaningless due to neither local field nor tunneling involved . </S>",

    "<S> the solutions of @xmath41 and @xmath33 by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) yield @xmath57 thus the lowest eigenenergies for the even- and odd - parity states are , respectively , @xmath58 it is intuitive to reach degeneracy by setting @xmath59 , which is , however , physically meaningless in our case . </S>",
    "<S> for any non - vanishing value of @xmath5 , we show a rigorous proof in appendix that there is no possibility of @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , a physically meaningful solution of the sbm in our case requires no degeneracy for the ground states of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which implies no qpt happening , in terms of the viewpoints in @xcite , no matter how to change the characteristic parameters and which bath is considered .    </S>",
    "<S> our results also mean that the ground state of @xmath24 is surely of a certain parity , and any employed state with mixed parity ( e.g. , the superposition of the ground states of @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) is definitely not the ground state of the model . in this sense , it is not a surprise that qpt was found in @xcite using a presumed ground state which , due to mixture of odd- and even - parity , is actually not for the ground state of the model . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , our result could be obtained more simply by calculating the magnetization @xmath63 . without losing generality </S>",
    "<S> , we assume the eigenfunction of @xmath31 with the two sub - eigensolutions correlated , i.e. , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 are the ground states , respectively , of @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> so the magnetization of the hamiltonian @xmath24 is @xmath67 if @xmath68 or @xmath69 with @xmath70 , which corresponds to even - parity case or odd - parity case , the magnetization @xmath71 is absolutely zero , which implies no qpt happening . </S>",
    "<S> the finite value of @xmath71 occurs only in the case of the superposition of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which , according to our discussion above , is not the ground state of the model .    besides the incorrect employment of the state as the ground state @xcite , the main reason for obtaining the qpt in previous literatures @xcite is the unreasonable treatment of the infrared divergence existing in the spectral functions for ohmic and sub - ohmic dissipations , which induced the degeneracy of the ground states in the low frequency domain . to clarify this point </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate below the potential infrared divergence in the treatments using the bath mode with continuous and discretized spectra , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the nrg is taken as an example to show that the prediction of the qpt in previous studies is completely due to divergent expansion in the infrared limit .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath76 is a small quantity regarding the frequency difference from @xmath77 . in the case of the infrared limit , i.e. , @xmath78 , we have @xmath79 if @xmath80 , which leads to @xmath81 ( see eq . ( 8) ) and thereby @xmath82 from eq . ( 10 ) . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> with calculation approaching the low frequency domain , the nrg gives a significant change from non - degeneracy to degeneracy , which was called qpt . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we see from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 7 ) that the tunneling terms are vanishing with the calculation approaching the infrared limit , which reduces @xmath24 to be @xmath83 commuting with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the localization , sometimes also called the frozen spin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it means that , once the system falls into a well - polarized state of the spin , the magnetization will remain unchanged in the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , it is the infrared divergence that wrongly predicts the qpt happening from the delocalization to the localization as the infrared limit is approached .    </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 12 ) presents the relationship between the prefactor and the dissipation strength @xmath17 , from which we see no possibility to have a finite value of @xmath17 as the critical number for the qpt . </S>",
    "<S> the degeneracy of the ground states occurs only in the case of @xmath84 , i.e. , a physically meaningless case . on the other hand , considering eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 7 ) , we may find that the infrared divergence also yields the parity operator @xmath85 to be zero . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the correct understanding of the parity variation could be reached only after we have eliminated the influence from the infrared divergence . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , the parity of the ground state of the model will explicitly break down as long as we introduce the non - zero local field into @xmath24 , which brings about a significant change in the magnetization as a function of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we prefer to call this phenomenon as parity breaking , instead of the qpt .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ]   in the calculation by nrg , where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 ( @xmath89 in inset ) . , </S>",
    "<S> title=\"fig:\",width=259 ]    _ for treatment with the bath mode of discretized spectrum : _ by means of the nrg logarithmic discretization parameter @xmath90 defined in @xcite , we have @xmath91 , where @xmath92 with @xmath93 a large number required by the method @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath94 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> so @xmath79 in the case of @xmath95 and @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> as an example , we show in fig . 1 the distribution of @xmath96 with respect to the mode - number @xmath93 for different @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the divergence leads to @xmath82 in the case of ohmic and sub - ohmic dissipations , from which the qpt was predicted in previous studies .    </S>",
    "<S> our work not only indicates for the first time that the parity keeping and breaking , rather the qpt , can fully characterize the behavior in the sbm , but also helps to understand a fact that the qpt had only been found by previous numerics in the sub - ohmic and the ohmic cases , instead of in the super - ohmic case , which is because the infrared divergence never happens in the super - ohmic case , e.g , @xmath97 for @xmath98 in the case of the continuous bath - mode spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , our investigation above has clearly shown that , whatever the bath - mode spectrum is , no qpt would happen if the local field is absent in the sbm .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , we have presented analytical treatments to show reliably the impossibility of the qpt in the sbm without the local field . </S>",
    "<S> since our treatments are independent of the bath type , the degrees of freedom of the bath and the calculation precision , we argue that the previous conclusions drawn for the qpt happening in the ohmic and sub - ohmic sbm need more serious reexamination . </S>",
    "<S> the parity discovered in the present work is strongly relevant to the configuration of the model and the parity breaking can significantly change the dynamics of the model . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the sbm has wide application ranging from the electron transfer in biomolecules @xcite to the entanglement in quantum information science @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefor , we believe that our study is of general interest and would be helpful for our deeper understanding of the weird phenomena in open quantum systems .    this work is supported by national fundamental research program of china ( grant no . </S>",
