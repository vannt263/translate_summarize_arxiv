    "discovery of fe - based superconductors ( febs ) in 2008 with the maximal @xmath3 of 55k gave rise to the debates on the origin of the superconducting state .",
    "febs can be broadly divided into the two classes , pnictides and chalcogenides  @xcite .",
    "since conductivity is provided by the feas layer , the discussion of physics in terms of quasi two - dimensional system in most cases gives reasonable results  @xcite .",
    "fe @xmath4-orbitals form the fermi surface ( fs ) that excluding the cases of extreme hole and electron dopings consists of two hole sheets around the @xmath5 point and two electron sheets around the @xmath6 point in the 2-fe brillouin zone ( bz ) . in the 1-fe bz",
    ", latter corresponds to the electron sheets around the @xmath7 and @xmath8 points .",
    "nesting between these two groups of sheets is the driving force for the spin - density wave ( sdw ) long - range magnetism in the undoped febs .",
    "upon doping the sdw state is destroyed but the residual scattering with the wave vector @xmath9 connecting hole and electron pockets naturally leads to the enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "@xmath9 is equal to @xmath10 in the 2-fe bz and to @xmath7 or @xmath8 in the 1-fe bz",
    ".    different mechanisms of cooper pairs formation result in distinct superconducting gap symmetry and structure  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the rpa - sf ( random - phase approximation spin fluctuation ) approach gives the extended @xmath0-wave gap that changes sign between hole and electron fermi surface sheets ( @xmath11 state ) as the main instability for the wide range of doping concentrations  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "orbital fluctuations promote the order parameter to have the sign - preserving @xmath2 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "thus , probing the gap structure can help in elucidating the underlying mechanism .",
    "in this respect , inelastic neutron scattering is a powerful tool since the measured dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath12 in the superconducting state carries information about the gap structure .    for the local interactions ( hubbard and hund s exchange )",
    ", @xmath13 can be obtained in the rpa from the bare electron - hole bubble @xmath14 by summing up a series of ladder diagrams to give @xmath15^{-1 } \\chi_0(\\mathbf{q},\\omega ) , \\label{eq : chi_s_sol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are interaction and unit matrices in orbital or band space , and all other quantities are matrices as well .",
    "scattering between nearly nested hole and electron fermi surfaces in febs produce a peak in the normal state magnetic susceptibility at or near @xmath18 . for the uniform @xmath0-wave gap , @xmath19 and there is no resonance peak . for the @xmath1 order parameter as well as for an extended non - uniform @xmath0-wave symmetry",
    ", @xmath9 connects fermi sheets with the different signs of gaps .",
    "this fulfills the resonance condition for the interband susceptibility , and the spin resonance peak is formed at a frequency @xmath20 below @xmath21 .",
    "the existence of the spin resonance in febs was predicted theoretically @xcite and subsequently discovered experimentally with many reports of well - defined spin resonances in all systems , see  @xcite .",
    "since there are always some amount of disorder even in the crystals of a very good quality , it is necessary to study the evolution of the spin response with increasing amount of disorder .",
    "here we do this within two models for the band structure ",
    "one is the simple four - band model in the 2-fe bz  @xcite and the other one is the three - orbital model in the 1-fe bz  @xcite with the spin - orbit coupling  @xcite . the effect of disorder on the spin susceptibility is incorporated via the static born approximation for the quasiparticle self - energy due to the impurity scattering .",
    "we study the spin response in the superconducting state of febs within the tight - binding models for the two - dimensional iron layer .",
    "some basic information can be gained from the four - band model of ref .",
    "@xcite , that is able to reproduce the fs obtained via band structure calculations .",
    "it has the following single - electron hamiltonian @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the annihilation operator of the @xmath4-electron with momentum @xmath24 , spin @xmath25 , and band index @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the on - site single - electron energies , @xmath28 is the electronic dispersion that yields hole pockets centered around the @xmath29 point , and @xmath30 is the dispersion that results in the electron pockets around the @xmath31 point . using the abbreviation @xmath32 we choose the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 for the @xmath35 and @xmath36 bands , respectively , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the @xmath39 and @xmath40 bands , correspondingly ( all values are in ev ) .",
    "the matrix elements of the bare spin susceptibility in the multiband system has the form : @xmath41 , \\label{eq : bare_chi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are matsubara frequencies , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the normal and anomalous ( superconducting ) green s functions , respectively .",
    "physical spin susceptibility @xmath46 obtained by calculating matrix elements @xmath47 via equation  ( [ eq : chi_s_sol ] ) with the interaction matrix @xmath48 .",
    "we assume here the effective hubbard interaction parameters to be @xmath49 and @xmath50 in order to stay in the paramagnetic phase  @xcite .",
    "we consider the magnetic susceptibility in the superconducting state assuming the @xmath1 state with @xmath51 , where @xmath52 was chosen to be @xmath53mev .",
    "the model described above lack for the orbital content of the bands .",
    "now we introduce the additional level of complexity by considering the three - orbital model in the 1-fe bz  @xcite . by introducing the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction to it  @xcite ,",
    "it is possible to explain the observed anisotropy of the spin resonance peak in ni - doped ba-122  @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath54 and @xmath55 components of the spin susceptibility are different thus breaking the spin - rotational invariance @xmath56 .",
    "this model comes from the three @xmath57 @xmath4-orbitals .",
    "the @xmath58 and @xmath59 components are hybridized and form two electron - like fs pockets around @xmath7 and @xmath8 points , and one hole - like pocket around @xmath5 point .",
    "the @xmath60 orbital is considered to be decoupled from them and form an outer hole pocket around @xmath29 point .",
    "latter differs from some popular orbital models for febs  @xcite .",
    "however , according to arpes data  @xcite and the dft calculations for highly doped systems  @xcite and undoped 122 , 1111 , and 111 materials  @xcite , @xmath60 orbital contribution to the fermi surface near @xmath29 point is quite large in the 2-fe brillouin zone .",
    "this situation is simulated by introducing the @xmath60 hole pocket near @xmath29 point in the three - orbital model .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is one - electron part with @xmath63 being the annihilation operator of a particle with momentum @xmath24 , spin @xmath25 and orbital index @xmath64 .",
    "keeping in mind the similarity of @xmath65 to the sr@xmath66ruo@xmath67 case , for simplicity we consider only the @xmath68-component of the so interaction , which affects @xmath58 and @xmath59 bands only  @xcite .",
    "the matrix of the full hamiltonian @xmath69 has the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 to reproduce the topology of the fs in pnictides , we choose the following parameters ( in ev ) : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 . as in the case of sr@xmath66ruo@xmath67 , eigenvalues of @xmath83 do not depend on the spin @xmath25 , therefore , spin - up and spin - down states are still degenerate in spite of the so interaction .",
    "components of the physical spin susceptibility @xmath84 are calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi_s_sol ] ) with the interaction matrix @xmath16 from ref .  @xcite .",
    "we choose the following values for the interaction parameters : spin - orbit coupling constant @xmath85mev , intraorbital hubbard @xmath86ev , hund s @xmath87ev , interorbital @xmath88 , and pair - hopping term @xmath89 . in the superconducting state",
    "we assume either the @xmath2 state with @xmath90 or the @xmath1 state with @xmath91 , where @xmath92mev .",
    "as were shown recently  @xcite , the multiband superconductors may demonstrate behavior much more complicated than originally expected from the abrikosov - gorkov theory  @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath93 transition may take place for the sizeable intraband attraction in the two - band @xmath1 model with the nonmagnetic impurities  @xcite .",
    "discussion of such effects are well beyond the scope of the present study since it requires a self - consistent solution of the frequency and gap equations within the strong - coupling @xmath94-matrix approximation . here",
    "we use a simple static born approximation for the quasiparticle self - energy to see the basic effects of nonmagnetic disorder on the spin resonance .",
    "that is , the multiple scattering on the same impurity results in the following self - energy : @xmath95 with @xmath96 being the quasiparticle lifetime ( see , e.g. the so - called first born approximation in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . calculating",
    "the exact momentum dependence of the quasiparticle lifetime is again the separate complicated task that would require realistic multiorbital models with proper orbital - to - bands contribution similar to what was done for the calculation of the transport coefficients in ref .",
    "this is again beyond the scope of the present work , so , neglecting the momentum dependence of @xmath96 , we set @xmath97 , where we treat the impurity scattering rate @xmath29 as a parameter .",
    "first , we consider the spin response in the four - band model .",
    "the result of the analytical continuation ( @xmath98 with @xmath99 ) is show in fig .",
    "[ fig : imchi4band ] for the set of impurity scattering rates @xmath29 . in the case of small @xmath29",
    ", the spin resonance peak is clearly seen below the energy of @xmath100 . with increasing @xmath29",
    "it becomes broader and almost vanishes once @xmath29 becomes comparable to @xmath52 .",
    "we can trace the energy of the spin resonance @xmath20 as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "value of @xmath20 is determined as the maximum of @xmath101 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : imchi4band ] . clearly , @xmath20 shifts to higher frequencies with increasing disorder .",
    "with @xmath102 in the 2-fe bz for the four - band model in the @xmath1 state ( main panel ) and the spin resonance frequency @xmath20 determined as the maximum of @xmath101 ( inset ) for different values of the impurity scattering rate @xmath29 .",
    "the spin resonance below @xmath103 becomes much broader with increasing @xmath29 and effectively disappears for @xmath104 .",
    "[ fig : imchi4band ] ]    these findings are in good agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite where the band model was simpler then used here but the vertex corrections in the particle - hole bubble due to the impurity scattering were included . in particular , for the same reduction of the resonance peak height we see similar broadening of the peak and small changes in the resonance frequency .",
    "such agreement imply that the vertex corrections do not play a crucial role in the low - energy spin response while they are known to be important for the proper calculation of the transport coefficients . on the other hand , compared to ref .",
    "@xcite , we go to larger values of the scattering rate and observe a nonlinear increase of the resonance frequency .     with @xmath105 in the 1-fe bz in the normal state , and for the @xmath2 and @xmath1 pairing symmetries . in the latter case",
    ", the resonance is clearly seen below @xmath103 .",
    "[ fig : imchi3orbso ] ]    now we switch to the three - orbital model .",
    "we calculated both @xmath106 and @xmath107 components of the spin susceptibility and confirmed that in the non - superconducting state @xmath108 at small frequencies , see fig .",
    "[ fig : imchi3orbso ] . for the @xmath1 superconductor",
    "we observe a well defined spin resonance and @xmath54 is again larger than @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , for the @xmath2 state the disparity between @xmath54 and @xmath55 is extremely small . with increasing impurity scattering rate the spin resonance peak broadens and its energy shifts to higher frequencies",
    "this is similar to the results in the four - band model so we conclude that the orbital character and the so coupling do not have much effect on the impurity - induced smearing of the spin resonance within the present approximation for the quasiparticle self - energy .",
    "note that the spin response in the @xmath1 state is still distinct from the one in the @xmath2 state even for a sizeable value of @xmath29 .",
    "this is important for the discussion of inelastic neutron data .",
    "since all real materials are prone to disorder the natural question arise : is it possible to distinguish between @xmath1 and @xmath2 states in the presence of non - magnetic impurities looking at the neutron data ? here we demonstrate that the answer is yes , spin responses would be quite different . and the other important difference comes from the negligible disparity of @xmath54 and @xmath55 components in the @xmath2 state , that contradicts results of the polarized neutron data  @xcite .",
    "we analysed the spin response in the superconducting state of febs in the presence of nonmagnetic disorder .",
    "the disorder was treated in the simple static born approximation thus giving only basic qualitative trends .",
    "average impurity scattering rate @xmath29 was considered as a parameter .",
    "for the small @xmath29 , the spin resonance peak is clearly observed below the energy of @xmath100 and with increasing @xmath29 it becomes broader and almost vanishes once @xmath29 becomes comparable to @xmath52 .",
    "the energy of the spin resonance @xmath20 ( determined as the maximum of the spin susceptibility ) shifts to higher frequencies with increasing disorder .",
    "the spin resonance peak gains anisotropy in the spin space due to the spin - orbit coupling , so for the @xmath1 superconductor @xmath54 is larger than @xmath55 . on the other hand , for the @xmath2 state",
