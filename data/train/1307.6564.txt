    "over the past 15 years , both theory and observations have shown that star formation and the growth of super - massive black holes in galaxies are fundamentally linked ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the physical mechanisms that drive the strong correlations of black hole mass ( @xmath3 ) with both the stellar bulge mass ( @xmath4 ) and stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath5 ) are not yet clearly understood .",
    "detailed observations of galaxies at cosmological distances play an essential part in the refinement of our theoretical and subsequent numerical models of galaxy evolution over cosmic time .",
    "high spatial resolution observations of galaxies with both starburst and agn characteristics are able to give a unique perspective of the interplay of these components .",
    "this is a particularly powerful probe of galaxy evolution at z@xmath62 , corresponding to the peak of quasar and star formation activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , detailed , high resolution studies of galaxies at this epoch are challenging as the imaging and 2d - spectral requirements are close to the limits of current instrumentation . to this end , many observations target gravitationally lensed sources which undergo a natural boost in flux and angular extent ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    lensing conserves surface brightness while increasing the apparent solid angle by a factor @xmath7 . for unresolved sources , this results in a factor @xmath8 increase in effective sensitivity for a fixed observing time .",
    "the above characteristics make ` cosmic telescopes ' powerful tools in high - redshift astrophysics _ provided that _ accurate lens models are derived .    although gravitational lensing is achromatic , different emission scales have differing magnification factors that can result in a distortion of the global spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "this has been referred to as ` differential ' lensing by some authors , however we suggest this is an inappropriate term since any extended source is differentially magnified due to the optics of the system .",
    "we use the term ` preferential lensing ' for the purposes of this work to convey the idea that different emission regions ( which dominate the global sed at different wavelengths ) have different magnification factors based on their position and size .",
    "therefore , preferential lensing at the very least avoids the confusion that arises between strong - lensing ` apparent chromacity ' and the magnification varying as a function of position for any narrowband image of a strongly - lensed system .",
    "the effects of preferential lensing are often ignored or not quantified in studies that use lensing as a comic telescope to investigate the background source , especially in the ( sub)millimetre regime where the spatial resolution is poor and/or multiple images are not detected and able to constrain the lens model .",
    "this paper presents first results of an extensive radio / mm observing programme to quantify this effect and the intrinsic starburst / agn energy contributions in the famous strongly lensed system iras fsc10214 + 47 ( iras  10214 hereafter ) .",
    "our aim is not the study of the lens galaxy but rather to use it as a ` cosmic telescope ' in order to investigate the background source iras  10214 .",
    "@xcite first identified iras  10214 as the highest redshift ( z @xmath6 2.3 ) source detected in the iras faint source catalogue . for a period of time in the early 1990s its apparent bolometric luminosity , @xmath9 , made it the most luminous object in the known universe .",
    "this enormous luminosity , 99  percent of which is radiated in the infrared , led to suggestions that this was a primeval galaxy in the process of formation @xcite .",
    "however spectroscopic and morphological arguments purported iras  10214 to be gravitationally lensed by a foreground galaxy at redshift z @xmath6 0.9 resulting in a total magnification between 50 - 100 at rest - frame optical / uv wavelengths ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , based on the arc - to - counter - image flux ratio .",
    "the lensing hypothesis was quite spectacularly confirmed by high resolution imaging with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "even after accounting for this high magnification factor , iras  10214 was , and still is , amongst the most luminous of the ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "spectro - polarimetry revealed the rest - frame ultraviolet to be @xmath628  percent polarised , as well as the presence of broad ultraviolet lines ( @xcite ) , providing strong evidence that this was the reflected light ( presumably off dust clouds associated with the narrow - line region ) from an obscured agn .",
    "the source model of iras 10214 could now conclusively include an active nucleus , however x - ray observations with both the chandra ( @xcite ) and xmm - newton ( @xcite ) space telescopes made low s / n detections , seemingly inconsistent with the powerful agn suggested by the luminous [ oiii]@xmath105007  line emission strength ( @xmath11 10@xmath12 w , @xcite ) .",
    "this lead to the suggestion that this is a compton thick object ( i.e. @xmath13 ) .",
    "the lower than expected x - ray luminosity could also be explained by preferential lensing of the scattering clouds ( i.e. the observable hot , ionised medium ) due to a suggested offset from the agn and as a result a larger magnification than that of the agn .",
    "however , @xcite use arguments ( that are re - investigated in @xcite ) about the smooth polarisation position angle variation along the emission arc in their _ hst _ ultraviolet map that limits this distance to @xmath6  40    100  pc in the source plane ( assuming @xmath7 = 50  100 ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the intrinsic quasar bolometric luminosity at this stage was clearly very large given the suggestions of preferential lensing and/or compton thick obscuration .",
    "multiple detections of a large reservoir of molecular gas ( @xmath14m@xmath15 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) supported suggestions that the far - infrared radiation originates from a massive starburst .",
    "conditions of the inter - stellar medium were probed with the detection of higher transition co lines ( 6 - 5 , 7 - 6 ) , as well as heavier atoms ( e.g. ci , @xcite ) and molecules found in the denser cores of star forming clouds ( e.g. hcn ( 1 - 0 ) , @xcite ) . despite this immense star - formation activity , mid - infrared _ spitzer",
    "_ spectroscopy did not reveal the strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission typical of ulirgs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this same _ spitzer _ spectrum showed a 9.7 @xmath7 m silicate feature in _ emission _ as opposed to the usual silicate absorption seen towards obscured agn .",
    "these attributes led @xcite to conclude that iras fsc10214 is unlike any ulirgs or agn in the local universe .",
    "they proposed that the agn is preferentially magnified and therefore masks the dominant starburst activity . from the very first publication on iras  10214 @xcite the question of the source of its enormous luminosity",
    "was highlighted : massive , dust - enshrouded star formation , or a buried active galactic nucleus ?",
    "clearly this remains an outstanding question in the case of iras  10214 as well as a major challenge to current galaxy evolution models .",
    "high resolution radio imaging , not obscured by dust , offers a unique perspective on this galaxy which has composite ( and in some cases counter - intuitive ) properties across the electromagnetic spectrum , which are summarised in  [ sec : overview ] .",
    "in addition , resolving the various components within iras  10214 and their respective scales will allow an estimate of the level of preferential lensing in the system and its effect on the global sed .",
    "this apparent sed distortion has been invoked in the explanation of the peculiar features of iras  10214 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but it is difficult to explore without a lens model that has well defined uncertainties .",
    "ironically , @xcite argued that the observed chromacity in source structure suggested that iras  10214 was _ not _ a lensed object .    in this , the first paper in a series , our scientific goal is to derive a lens model for the iras  10214 system with well - defined uncertainties ; and to use our spatially - resolved detections to derive magnification factors of each emission region probed .",
    "we wish to address the questions : can we decompose iras  10214 into different physical components with our resolved radio maps as well as our extended radio spectral coverage ?",
    "if so , is a particular emission region preferentially magnified leading to the peculiar features found by the above authors ? we include the _ hst _ rest - frame ultraviolet map in this analysis for two reasons : ( 1 ) to derive a lens model with well - defined uncertainty ; ( 2 ) this map is likely dominated by scattered quasar light meaning its source - plane and polarisation properties are valuable clues when addressing the above questions .",
    "a more detailed study of preferential lensing is necessary as gravitational lenses provide us with the deepest views of galaxy formation and evolution in the universe , and so any biases require investigation ( e.g. effect on selection functions and the resultant source counts at various wavelengths , inferred star formation rate from high - redshift lensed co detected galaxies , derived black hole masses of lensed sources , etc . ) .",
    "this is particularly relevant to the large sample of far - infrared selected , lensed galaxies discovered with the _ herschel space observatory _ ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , key to our understanding the fundamentally important population of ` sub - millimetre ' galaxies ( smgs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at @xmath16 , which are thought to be the progenitors of present day massive ellipticals .",
    "as new facilities come online in the next decade , the number of strongly - lensed systems will grow by orders of magnitude and so any systematic biases must be accounted for in detailed studies of individual systems .",
    "it will however become easier to do so with the superior sensitivity and angular resolution of forthcoming radio and millimetre facilities ( e.g. _ lofar , e - merlin , meerkat , jvla , e - evn , alma _ ) once fully commissioned and eventually with the _ square kilometre array ( ska)_.    this paper is structured as follows : in  2 we present the observations , including a deep _ hst _ f160w map as well as resolved _ merlin _ and _ vla _ radio maps . in ",

    "<S> this is the first paper in a series that present a multi - wavelength analysis of the archetype ultra - luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) iras  fsc10214 + 47 , a gravitationally lensed , starburst / agn at @xmath0 . here we present a new lens model and spatially - resolved radio data , as well as a deep _ hst _ f160w map . the lens modelling employs a bayesian markov chain monte carlo algorithm with extended - source , forward ray - tracing . using these high resolution _ </S>",
    "<S> hst _ , _ merlin _ and _ vla _ maps , the algorithm allows us to constrain the level of distortion to the continuum spectral energy distribution resulting from emission components with differing magnification factors , due to their size and proximity to the caustic . </S>",
    "<S> our lens model finds the narrow line region ( nlr ) , and by proxy the active nucleus , is preferentially magnified . </S>",
    "<S> this supports previous claims that preferential magnification could mask the expected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon spectral features in the _ spitzer _ mid - infrared spectrum which roughly trace the star - forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show the arc - to - counter - image flux ratio is not a good estimate of the magnification in this system , despite its common use in the iras  fsc10214 + 47 literature . </S>",
    "<S> our lens modelling suggests magnifications of @xmath1 for the _ hst _ f814w , _ merlin _  1.7  ghz and _ vla _  8  ghz maps , significantly lower than the canonical values of @xmath2 often used for this system . </S>",
    "<S> systematic errors such as the dark matter density slope and co - location of stellar and dark matter centroids dominate the uncertainties in the lens model at the 40 percent level .    </S>",
