    "the recent observational data from ia supernovae , the large scale structure and cosmic microwave background anisotropies confirm that the universe is undergoing a late - time acceleration @xcite .",
    "a unknown component , known as dark energy , is believed to be responsible for this accelerated expansion .",
    "cosmological observation suggest that the two - thirds of the the total energy of the universe is been occupied by this dark energy .",
    "remaining portion is almost occupied by dark matter with a little presence of baryonic matter @xcite .",
    "+ there are many candidates for dark energy and the simplest among them is a tiny positive cosmological constant with equation of state parameter @xmath3 . but the fine - tuning and the cosmological coincidence problem occur when we deal with the cosmological constant . hence we tend to look at the dynamic scalar field models whose equation of state parameter are not constant but evolve with the cosmic time .",
    "the modified gravity approach is a gravitational alternative to explain the accelerated expansion .",
    "these two approaches may compliment each other as shown by the works of many authors @xcite .",
    "+ holographic principle proposed by fischler and suskind @xcite is one of the important results of the recent investigations that arise exploring the quantum gravity theory or the string theory @xcite . depending on this holographic principle the nature of the dark energy in the context of quantum gravity is called the holographic dark energy ( hde ) .",
    "an enlargement relationship as proposed by _",
    "cohen et al _ @xcite between the infra - red ( ir ) and ultraviolet cut - offs due to the limitation set by the formation of a black - hole , which establishes an upper limit for the vacuum energy , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the hde density related to the uv cut - off , @xmath6 is the ir cut - off and @xmath7 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the hde may provide simultaneously natural solutions to both dark energy and cosmological problems @xcite .",
    "specially it can resolve the coincidence problem @xcite and the phantom crossing @xcite .",
    "besides the model has reasonable agreement with the astrophysical data of cmb , sneia and galaxy redshift surveys @xcite . on these accounts ,",
    "hde paradigm has been extended via different cut - offs @xcite and entropy corrections @xcite .",
    "the holographic scale l can be identified with the future event horizon [ 34 ] , the conformal age of the universe @xcite or the ricci scalar of the universe @xcite . specially the model taking the conformal age of the universe is also dubbed as new agegraphic dark energy model . a recent extension of this idea",
    "is @xmath1-type hde @xcite , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the parameters associated with the chosen ir cut - off @xmath10 a holographic dark energy model with a conformal - like age of the universe as the scale l @xcite is consistent with the history from the inflation to the current universe . in this sense ,",
    "all such scales are proposed at a phenomenological level . in analogy with the trend ,",
    "perhaps the direct physical motivation of proposing such characteristic scales for @xmath1-type holographic dark energy model is still obscure , but it generalized the theory with significant improvements and the parameters @xmath11 provide us more space in theory to fit the observational data . in particular , for some specific values of @xmath11 the equation of state can naturally evolve cross phantom divide even without introducing an interaction between dark energy and dark matter .",
    "also when @xmath11 take some specific value all the agegraphic - like dark energy models can be recovered .",
    "this construction is also applicable to the models with generalized future event horizon as the holographic size in the same spirit . for age - like holographic models , when @xmath12 it seems that dark energy has the same behavior as the dominant ingredient in the early epoches of the universe .",
    "which imply that dark energy might be unified with dark matter",
    ". however , we have to introduce some mechanism to make dark energy deviate from dark matter state , and eventually become dominant and be responsible for the acceleration of the universe . to achieve this",
    "we need some appropriate interactions between dark energy and dark matter .",
    "this model is always stable in the dark energy dominated era in newtonian gauge .",
    "the preliminary numerical analysis has indicated that this model fits with the observational data very well .",
    "the best - fit analysis in this reference indicates that this model with @xmath13 and small m is more favored including the cases of @xmath14 etc @xcite . + black - hole entropy ( bh ) @xmath15 plays an important role in the derivation of hde .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the area of the bh horizon .",
    "the bh entropy - area relation faces a modification in loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) due to thermal equilibrium fluctuation , quantum fluctuation or mass and charge fluctuations , in the form @xcite @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are dimensionless constants of unit order .",
    "wei @xcite has proposed the energy - density of the entropy - corrected hde with the help of this corrected entropy - area relation setup of lqg and obtained the energy density of the entropy - corrected hde .",
    "the application of the the ir cut - off @xmath21 here would be a interesting aspect to see .",
    "+ modification of the einstein s general theory of relativity is popular aspect to explain the the accelerated cosmic expansion .",
    "@xmath22 gravity @xcite , @xmath23 gravity @xcite , @xmath0 gravity @xcite , @xmath24 gravity , @xmath25 gravity are some popular modified gravity models . beside explaining cosmic expansion",
    "these theories are also helpful in explaining the unification of early - time inflation and late - time acceleration era and then the non - phantom to phantom phase and many more .",
    "there are many works in the literature on the correspondence between different kinds of hde and modified gravity @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have considered the correspondence of @xmath0 gravity ( where @xmath26 is the gauss - bonnet invariant ) with ordinary and entropy - corrected @xmath1-type hde in the light of power law of @xmath27 .",
    "+ the einstein s field equations in frw model in the background of @xmath0 gravity are discussed in section ii .",
    "our main aim is to discuss the correspondence of the well - accepted @xmath0 gravity theory with two dark energy models : @xmath1-type holographic dark energy [ @xmath1-type hde ] and entropy - corrected @xmath1-type holographic dark energy , which will be discussed in sections iia and iib .",
    "we have also discussed the classical stability issues in both models in section iii .",
    "finally , we draw some concluding remarks . +",
    "the action of @xmath0 is considered as @xcite @xmath28 where , @xmath0 is an arbitrary function of gauss - bonnet invariant @xmath26 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is lagrangian of the matter present in the universe .",
    "this action describes the einstein s gravity coupled with perfect fluid plus a gauss - bonnet @xmath31 term .",
    "we set the planck mass to unity .",
    "the field equations in flrw space - time with signature @xmath32 are @xmath33 @xmath34  where @xmath35 is the energy density contribution of @xmath0 , further @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the effective energy density and pressure respectively . here",
    "@xmath38 , @xmath39 , where the dot represents the time derivative .",
    "now , further calculation reveals that @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the matter density at redshift @xmath42 and @xmath43 is eos parameter of the matter field .",
    "+  in literature , there is no unique functional form of @xmath0 , but to study the evolution , a functional form of @xmath0 is required . now to reconstruct @xmath0 gravity model we are trying to consider two models ( i ) @xmath1-type hde model and ( ii ) entropy - corrected @xmath1-type hde model .      now to process to reconstruct @xmath0 gravity with @xmath1-type hde , we need the energy density , which is given by @xcite @xmath44 with @xmath45 constant and @xmath46 generalized ir cut - off defined as @xmath10  where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constants .",
    "this model mimics the general agegraphic dark energy models with some differences .",
    "the naive difference backs to the choice of appropriate cut - off of the model . also for some reasonable values of @xmath1",
    "this model crosses the phantom line @xmath3 .",
    "also the pair @xmath1 are arbitrary and at level of phenomenological the high energy models , need not to be integers .",
    "this model generates ordinary hde for @xmath47 .",
