    "one of the challenging problems in general relativity is to construct viable , traversable wormholes @xcite from curvature of spacetime and physically meaningful energy - momenta .",
    "most of the sources to support wormholes to date , unfortunately consists of exotic matter which violates the energy conditions @xcite .",
    "more recently , however , there are examples of thin - shell wormholes that resist against collapse when sourced entirely by physical ( normal ) matter satisfying the energy conditions @xcite . from this token",
    ", it has been observed that pure einstein s gravity consisting of einstein - hillbert ( eh ) action with familiar sources alone does nt suffice to satisfy the criteria required for normal matter .",
    "this leads automatically to taking into account the higher curvature corrections known as the lovelock hierarchy @xcite .",
    "most prominent term among such higher order corrections is the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term to modify the eh lagrangian .",
    "there is already a growing literature on einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egb ) gravity and wormhole constructions in such a theory .    in this paper",
    "we intend to fill a gap in this line of thought which concerns einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory amended with the gb term .",
    "more specifically , we wish to construct thin - shell wormholes that are supported by normal ( i.e. non - exotic ) matter . to this end , we first construct higher dimensional ( @xmath0 ) exact black hole solutions in eymgb theory .",
    "this we do by employing the higher dimensional wu - yang ansatz which has been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the distinctive point with this particular ansatz is that the ym invariant emerges with the same power , irrespective of the spacetime dimensionality . in this regard eym solution becomes simpler in comparison with the einstein - maxwell ( em ) solutions .",
    "this motivates us to seek for thin - shell wormholes by cutting / pasting method in eym theory .",
    "another point of utmost importance is the gb parameter ( @xmath3 ) , whose sign plays a crucial role in the positivity of energy of the system .",
    "although in string theory this parameter is chosen positive for some valid reasons , when it comes to the subject of wormholes our choice favors the negative values ( @xmath4 ) , for the gb parameter .",
    "one more item that we consider in detail in this study is to investigate the stability of such wormholes against linear perturbations when the pressure and energy density are linearly related .",
    "the exact solution to eymgb gravity that we shall employ in this paper were established before @xcite .",
    "our line element is chosen in the form 7 @xmath5 in which @xmath6 is the only metric function and @xmath7where@xmath8according to the higher dimensional wu - yang ansatz the ym potential is chosen as@xmath9where @xmath10 is the non - zero structure constants @xcite . by this choice",
    "the ym invariant @xmath11 reduces to a simple form@xmath12which yields the energy - momentum tensor@xmath13 , \\text { \\ and \\ } \\kappa = \\frac{d-6}{d-2}.\\]]accordingly , the field equations are ( without a cosmological term ) @xmath14where @xmath15@xmath3 is the gb parameter and gb lagrangian @xmath16 is given by @xmath17    the exact solutions which we shall use throughout this paper are @xcite @xmath18 in which @xmath19 with the gb parameter @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath20 stands for the usual adm mass of the black hole and @xmath21 is the ym charge .",
    "when compared with ref.s @xcite ( for @xmath1 ) and @xcite ( for @xmath2 ) the meaning of @xmath20 implies that @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "let us also add that in ref .",
    "@xcite we set @xmath24 through scaling . the crucial point in our solution",
    "is that the ym term under the square root has a fixed power @xmath25 for all d@xmath26  as it can be checked , the negative branch gives the correct limit of higher dimensional black hole solution in eym theory of gravity if @xmath27 and therefore in the sequel we only consider this specific case .",
    "we also notice that for negative @xmath3 there exists a curvature singularity at @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the smallest radius of which , for @xmath30 inside the square root is positive . for @xmath31",
    "although for @xmath32 there is no curvature singularity , for @xmath33 it depends on the value of the free parameters ( i.e. , @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath20 ) to result in a curvature singularity .    here , in order to explore the physical properties of the above solutions we investigate some essential thermodynamic quantities .",

    "to study the stability of the thin - shell wormhole , constructed above , we consider a radial perturbation of the radius of the throat @xmath116 after the linear perturbation we may consider a linear relation between the energy density and radial pressure , namely @xcite@xmath117here the constant @xmath114 is given by ( 36 ) and @xmath118 reads as@xmath119 \\right\\ } .\\]]the constant parameter @xmath120 for the wormhole supported by normal matter is related to the speed of sound . by considering ( 37 ) in ( 31 ) , one finds @xmath121 in which @xmath122 is the radius of the throat in static equilibrium wormhole and @xmath123 is the static energy density ( pressure ) on the thin - shell . by equating the latter expression and the one found by using einstein equation on the shell ( 28 )",
