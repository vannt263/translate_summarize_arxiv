    "frustration is a common feature of magnetic interactions on a pyrochlore lattice .",
    "it often has the consequence of introducing a large degree of degeneracy into the ground state .",
    "this might be relieved by weaker interactions with the result that long - range order sets in at temperatures much smaller than the overall energy scale set by the interactions which , itself , is typically correlated with the curie - weiss temperature . fluctuations alone can relieve the energetic degeneracy ( e.g. @xcite ) by a mechanism called order - by - disorder or even select states that do not lie within the ground state manifold @xcite .",
    "the suppression of the transition temperature compared to the characteristic energy scale of the interactions can result in quantum fluctuations being more important than thermal fluctuations in dictating the ordering .",
    "another possibility is that the degeneracy is not relieved in spite of weaker interactions or fluctuations so that spin liquids or states with unconventional long - range order emerge ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "the diversity of theoretical possibilities that arises as a consequence of magnetic frustration is paralleled by experiments which have brought many unusual materials to light . even among the heavy rare earth titanate pyrochlore magnets , one can find materials that have no conventional long - range order at the lowest temperatures explored - the spin ices ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , and the cooperative paramagnets tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite and yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , and materials which do exhibit conventional long - range order , but which are puzzling in their own right : gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite and er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we consider the latter material .",
    "er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , which has a curie - weiss temperature @xmath2 k @xcite , undergoes a zero - field transition at about @xmath3 k into a phase with ordering wavevector @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the magnetic structure has been characterized through an analysis of spherical neutron polarimetry data @xcite .",
    "there are six domains which can be represented by showing the spin configuration on a single tetrahedron .",
    "figure [ fig : etostates ] represents the spin orientation on a tetrahedral primitive unit cell for a @xmath4 ordered state ; two others are obtained by discrete global rotations and the remainder are time reverses of the first three .",
    "henceforth , we refer to these as @xmath5 states to conform to the notation used in @xcite and @xcite ; these states transform according to the magnetic two dimensional irreducible representation @xmath6 based on the octahedral point group @xmath7 of the pyrochlore lattice for which the spins are oriented perpendicular to the local @xmath8 directions .",
    "the crystal field is responsible for the local @xmath9 anisotropy , but the occurrence of discrete ordered states is not presently understood @xcite .",
    "one ordered domain ( @xmath5 state ) of er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the spins are in the easy planes perpendicular to the local @xmath8 directions .",
    "the other five possible ground state configurations are obtained by discrete rotations and time reversal.,width=188 ]    an inelastic neutron scattering scan for scattering along the @xmath10 $ ] direction has revealed a gapless or almost gapless mode in zero field at @xmath11 $ ] @xcite . as a magnetic field",
    "@xmath12 along @xmath13 $ ] increases from zero , one finds that the spectrum is gapped for fields around @xmath14 t and for strong fields @xmath15 t but that there is a regime in between where it is apparently gapless .",
    "it has been suggested , on this basis that there is a field - driven quantum phase transition in this material @xcite .    in connection with er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "an easy plane model , with classical spins constrained to lie in the local @xmath16 planes and interacting via isotropic exchange @xcite , has been studied .",
    "energetically , this model has an extensive ground state degeneracy but monte carlo simulations show that there is a thermally - driven order - by - disorder transition to the @xmath5 states .",
    "however , it is known that this can not be the complete solution to the problem of @xmath5 selection in er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "first of all , experimentally , the zero field transition is known to be continuous , whereas the simulations reveal a strong first order transition .",
    "another problem is that the er@xmath17 ions have a dipole moment that breaks the degeneracy associated with the isotropic exchange , leading to a different @xmath4 ordering to that seen in er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "finally , the heat capacity in the low temperature phase varies as @xmath18 whereas the model predicts a linear variation with temperature .",
    "this paper investigates the conditions under which the selection of @xmath5 states as ground states may be determined energetically and at the mean field level in the real compound .",
    "we reason as follows : regardless of the mechanism behind the observed ordering , a six - fold anisotropy must be present in the real system to select the discrete set of states . whether this anisotropy is generated `` energetically '' , `` entropically '' or `` dynamically '' via quantum fluctuations is most likely not a meaningful question from an experimental point of view because , in all likelihood , the experimental observables determined for a material exhibiting true order - by - disorder could be mimicked by an appropriate choice of interactions that uniquely select the ordered states .",
    "given that the only known order - by - disorder mechanism is problematic and that energetic selection can be studied , for example , within mean field theory , we adopt the latter approach .",
    "the question is then whether such interactions could be natural in er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 in the sense that they could be justified within a microscopic model .",
    "we investigate this issue in the following .",
    "in this section , we look at the problem of whether the most general nearest neighbour interactions , expressed in terms of the er@xmath17 angular momenta on a pyrochlore , can break the local xy spin rotation symmetry down to the observed ordered states of er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 without any single ion anisotropies .",
    "we show that , in fact , these interactions are not sufficient to select the required states .",
    "we start from the nearest neighbour exchange interactions allowed by symmetry on a pyrochlore lattice which can be found in @xcite and which we present here , in table [ table : exchange ] , with respect to four sets of local axes - one for each sublattice .",
    "the sum of the terms in each of the four columns of the table is a linear combination of bilinear operators that is invariant under the point group of the pyrochlore lattice @xmath7 .",
    "we denote the four invariants by @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "the isotropic exchange interaction , nearest neighbour dipole - dipole interaction , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are unit vectors connecting nearest neighbours , and the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction , @xmath23 @xcite , can be written as linear combinations of these invariants .",
    "for example , isotropic exchange @xmath24 .",
    "ordinarily the dipole - dipole interaction is long - ranged ; because we cut it off beyond nearest neighbours , which is not unreasonable for modelling a zero moment @xmath4 ordering , we refer to it as the pseudo - dipole interaction .",
    "we can express these exchange interactions in terms of bilinears that are the products of basis vectors of the point group .",
    "for er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , the irreducible representation that goes critical at the transition temperature is the two dimensional irreducible representation @xmath6 @xcite which has orthogonal basis vectors that we denote by @xmath25 and @xmath26 from which the order parameter can be constructed .",
    "these basis vectors are written explicitly in terms of @xmath27 components in equation [ eqn : epem ] in the appendix .",
    "one can show that these basis vectors appear in the symmetry allowed exchange interactions @xmath19 only in the combination @xmath28 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the crucial point of the argument is that this exchange term does _ not _ distinguish any directions in the easy planes of the four sublattices so , in the thermodynamic limit , one would expect a continuous symmetry breaking provided the coefficient of @xmath28 in the hamiltonian is negative .",
    "this situation is captured by a landau theory based on the @xmath6 irreducible representation to quartic order in the order parameter .",
    "the order parameter for er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 is the expectation value of @xmath29 for @xmath30 and then five other values related to the first by symmetry .",
    "these are minima of a landau theory to sixth order in the invariants of @xmath6 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the conclusion of this section is that nearest neighbour exchange interactions allowed by symmetry on a pyrochlore can not , in the absence of single ion anisotropies , break the symmetry uniquely down to the @xmath5 states . in the next section ,",
    "we explore a mechanism for the generation of sixth order terms in the landau theory for er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",

    "we mentioned in section [ sec : introduction ] that , with isotropic exchange interactions , the pyrochlore with xy anisotropy has an extensive ground state degeneracy @xcite , and that the discrete @xmath5 states belong to this continuous set of ground states .",
    "then , the inclusion of a six - fold anisotropy , with minima along the spin directions of the @xmath5 states , must break the degeneracy exclusively down to the six @xmath5 domains observed in er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "single ion anisotropies were omitted in the symmetry arguments of section [ section : symmetry ] . with classical spins ,",
    "the relevant single ion anisotropy is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is an angle in the local @xmath65 plane .",
    "this is proportional to the racah operator @xmath66 which appears in the crystal field hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "so , although the lowest crystal field doublet has almost perfect xy degeneracy , one might expect that the mixing of excited crystal field levels into the ground state induced by the interactions between the angular momenta could perhaps introduce a six - fold anisotropy of the correct modulation to break the symmetry energetically .",
    "this would fulfil the requirement that the hamiltonian be well - motivated from a microscopic point of view .",
    "we note , however , that recent inelastic neutron scattering experiments on er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite do not resolve a gap to spin excitations which should be present if the symmetry is broken in the ground state .",
    "however , as we point out below , one would expect this gap , if it exists , to be small .    to investigate whether the excited crystal field levels can introduce a six - fold anisotropy with the correct modulation , we have studied a microscopic hamiltonian @xmath67 where @xmath68 the greek indices are angular momentum components , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are sublattice indices ( ranging from @xmath71 to @xmath72 ) and @xmath73 is a primitive lattice vector with @xmath74 ; index @xmath75 runs over all magnetic ions .",
    "the crystal field parameters @xmath76 are rescaled from those of ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , and the choice of nearest neighbour exchange couplings @xmath77 is guided by the requirement that , in the phase diagrams to be presented below , the order of magnitude of the couplings should be consistent with the experimental curie - weiss temperature @xcite which we have fitted by computing the uniform susceptibility in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite , and in the paramagnetic phase , from the hamiltonian given above .",
    "we rewrite @xmath78 on a single tetrahedron as @xmath79 , hence constraining the elements of @xmath80 .",
    "to proceed , we carry out a mean - field decoupling of @xmath81 by writing it as @xmath82 and omitting the last term which quantifies the fluctuations .",
    "the angled brackets indicate a thermal average @xmath83 , and we have abbreviated @xmath84 by @xmath85 .    the original interacting problem is reduced to a single ion problem @xmath86 where @xmath87 is an effective magnetic field of the form @xmath88 .",
    "mean field solutions for a cubic unit cell and examination of the rpa susceptibility show that , for the parameters we have explored , the ordering wavevector is @xmath4 .",
    "so , for a qualitative investigation , we can , at this time , restrict our attention to a single tetrahedron .",
    "starting from random choices for the twelve expectation values @xmath89 , the hamiltonian is iterated to self - consistency for different couplings .",
    "we have found that the six @xmath5 domains are solutions to the mean field equations for some regions of parameter space .",

    "this result can be understood in terms of a mean field treatment of the quantum corrections to the hamiltonian obtained by projecting onto the space spanned by the ground state crystal field doublet ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
