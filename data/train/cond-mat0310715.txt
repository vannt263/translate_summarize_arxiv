    "a prominent feature of a superfluid is the way it behaves under rotation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to a normal fluid , that rotates like a rigid body at thermal equilibrium , the thermodynamically stable state of a superfluid at low enough frequency does not rotate . at higher frequencies ,",
    "a finite amount of angular momentum appears in the form of vortex filaments at which the superfluid density vanishes .",
    "the circulation of the velocity field flow evaluated on a closed contour that encircles the vortex is quantized @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the existence of a macroscopic wavefunction , whose phase changes by an integer multiple of @xmath2 around the vortex filaments .",
    "atomic bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite provide a reference system where the superfluid behaviour can be studied in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "a set of recent experiments has demonstrated @xcite the existence of vortices in atomic condensates .",
    "the rotational frequency at which the first vortex is nucleated has been shown to depend on parameters such as the trap geometry ( aspect ratio ) , the nature and the characteristic time of the stirring beam , the number of atoms in the trap and may therefore vary from one experiment to another .",
    "the ratio of this characteristic rotational frequency to the transverse harmonic trapping frequency varies in these experiments from @xmath3 @xcite to @xmath4@xcite .",
    "most of theoretical studies of vortex nucleation in atomic bec which preceded these experiments @xcite , determine the characteristic nucleation frequency of the first vortex from the criterion that the vortex - state becomes the minimum of the thermodynamic free energy of the system evaluated in the co - rotating frame .",
    "in @xcite the global as well as local stability of the vortex state is discussed within the framework of the bogoliubov theory @xcite . using the thomas - fermi approximation ,",
    "the thermodynamic characteristic frequency can be expressed @xcite in terms of the other system parameters .",
    "these works have been reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the characteristic rotational frequency of the vortex nucleation thus obtained is generally lower than the values observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the presence of a vortex in a static condensate is associated with an extra energy relative to the vortex free state .",
    "using the thomas - fermi approximation it can be shown that this energy is the highest when the vortex is located at the center of the trap and decreases monotonically as a function of the distance between the center of the vortex and the center of the trap @xcite .",
    "within thomas - fermi approximation ( without any boundary correction ) it can be shown that this energy vanishes at the boundary of the system .",
    "thus we can define the energy of a vortex - state @xmath5 as a function of the distance @xmath6 , namely the separation between the vortex and the center of the trap and @xmath7 has a maximum at @xmath8 . for an increasing rotational frequency this maximum is shifted from the center to the boundary of the system @xcite and at rotational frequencies higher than the thermodynamic characteristic frequency this leads to a surface energy barrier to the nucleation of a vortex .",
    "this explains why a vortex can not be nucleated in a trapped condensate even though the trap is rotated at the thermodynamic characteristic frequency .",
    "the characteristic frequency for the vortex nucleation can be determined if one knows under what condition and at what rotational frequency a state carrying finite angular momentum will be transferred from the surface to the bulk of the condensate by overcoming the surface energy barrier .",
    "theoretical studies in this direction have been done in @xcite .",
    "they are based on an analysis of the collective excitations localized at the surface of the condensate , namely the surface modes @xcite .",
    "these modes appear as shape deformations that carry a finite angular momentum about the axis of rotation @xcite and have no radial node . in a rotated condensate",
    "these surface modes are excited and this leads to the vortex nucleation .",
    "a generalization of the landau criterion @xcite allows to determine at what rotational frequency , the surface mode corresponding to a given angular momentum quantum number is excited and leads to the nucleation of a vortex .",
    "the characteristic nucleation determined in this way agrees with the value experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "vortices are also nucleated by exciting a particular surface mode through a controlled trap deformation @xcite and this problem has been theoretically studied in @xcite .    thus far theoretical studies of the problem of vortex nucleation in a trapped condensate has been conducted in the framework of interacting bosons using various approximation schemes .",
    "it is also known that the stable state of a set of non - interacting bosons in an axisymmetric harmonic trap does not have finite angular momentum along the @xmath9-direction for a rotational frequency less than the trap frequency .",
    "a finite amount of interaction makes vortex states energetically feasible at a lower rotational frequency . in this article",
    "we study the nucleation of a vortex from the surface to the bulk of a system by solving the one - particle schr@xmath0dinger equation with a set of non - local and chiral boundary conditions . to that purpose",
    "we start by discussing in section ii the role of boundary conditions in a many - body problem . in section iii , we review the problem of a trapped boson rotating at a given frequency in an infinite plane and briefly discuss the corresponding energy spectrum in a finite disc while applying dirichlet boundary conditions . in section ( iv )",
    "we introduce the chiral boundary conditions for rotating bosons in a disc and we show how the hilbert space splits into bulk and edge states .",
    "we subsequently analyze the nucleation mechanism , _",
    "i.e. _ the transfer of angular momentum form edge to bulk .",
    "the characteristic angular rotation is given in terms of the trap frequency at which the first and then successive vortices are nucleated in the bulk .",
    "the variation of the size of the bulk region with increasing rotation is discussed and its physical implication is pointed out .",
    "we start with the following hamiltonian corresponding to @xmath10 interacting bosons of mass @xmath11 h_mb=_i=1^n -_i^2 + _ i , j v(|_i-_j| ) - e_0 [ mbh]where @xmath12 is the ground state energy . except for some specific cases ,",
    "one does not know how to diagonalize this hamiltonian .",
    "therefore some approximation schemes must be defined whose purpose is to obtain an effective quadratic hamiltonian .",
    "we may consider , for instance , the feynman description @xcite that accounts for the excited states under the form ( _ 1 , , _ n)=f _ 0(_1 , , _",
    "n ) where @xmath13 is the exact but unknown ground state wavefunction such that @xmath14 , and we assume that @xmath15 .",
    "the writing of @xmath16 as a sum over one body terms is exact for the non - interacting problem . for the interacting case ,",
    "such a decomposition assumes that the interaction is adiabatically switched on .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath17 is obtained by minimizing the energy e = where @xmath18 .",
    "it can be shown that @xcite the effective energy @xmath19 can be written as e = -_0df^ ( ) ^2f ( ) where @xmath20 is the ground state density . to obtain the corresponding spectrum , we have to impose boundary conditions on @xmath21 .",
    "assuming translational invariance , feynman obtained that @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath23 is the structure factor . in a trapped condensate the translational invariance is broken by the presence of a confinement potential .",
    "the function @xmath21 is related to the order parameter @xmath24 .",
    "the choices for boundary conditions on the order parameter @xmath24 is broad as it depends on the nature of the confining potential and on the effective one body term generated by the interaction",
    ". it might be thus possible to take into account at least partly the effect of interactions by solving a linear schr@xmath0dinger like equation under suitable choices of boundary conditions .",
    "however in the absence of a specific relation between such boundary conditions and the effective interactions , these choices are generally guided by the nature of the problem .    in this paper",
    "we study the vortex nucleation in a confined geometry by solving a one - particle schr@xmath0dinger equation for the condensate wavefunction @xmath24 with a set of non - local and chiral boundary conditions .",
    "such boundary conditions have been proposed in order to deal with such non - linear problems @xcite .",
    "these boundary conditions are motivated by the following considerations .",
    "we know @xcite that the dispersion relation for the surface excitations determines the characteristic rotational frequency of vortex nucleation .",
    "the proposed boundary conditions are designed in order to provide a clear distinction between the bulk and edge states of a two dimensional rotating boson gas .",
    "the angular momentum quantum numbers of edge states as we shall see are higher than those of bulk states .",
    "vortices are then nucleated by transferring a state from the edge to the bulk hilbert spaces .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian of a trapped boson in a two dimensional domain rotating with a uniform angular frequency @xmath25 :    h=+m^2 r^2 -l_z [ hm1 ]    we define the vector potential    _ f= where @xmath26 .",

    "the centrifugal force just offsets the confinement and hence the bosonic system becomes unstable .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath30 and the eigenvalues @xmath31 of the hamiltonian for the infinite plane are characterized by two integer quantum numbers @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",

    "we consider now the problem of a trapped rotating boson in a disc of radius @xmath50 imposing dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the corresponding spectrum is derived in the same way as for the electron in a perpendicular magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the dirichlet boundary condition ( dbc ) @xmath51 , is according to ( [ rbwf ] )  @xmath52 where @xmath53 is equivalent to the magnetic flux .",
    "the energy spectrum is obtained from the zeroes of the confluent hypergeometric function @xmath54 , that can be separated into two classes according to the sign of the corresponding angular momentum . for @xmath55 ,",

    "1f_1(-,l+1 ; ) = 0 [ dirichlet1 ] with @xmath56 . for @xmath57",
    "the energy levels are given by _",
    "1f_1(-,-l+1 ; ) = 0 [ dirichlet2 ] it is important to notice that the equation @xmath58 has solutions only for @xmath59 and , in the interval @xmath60 , it has exactly @xmath61 real solutions .",
    "this eliminates the possibility of having for rotating bosons , a ground state given by the lowest landau level solution for which @xmath62 .",
    "0.751.0pc    0.751.0pc    the infinite plane solutions are reached asymptotically for large @xmath63 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "there is no difference in this spectrum between bulk and edge states . for @xmath42 , the state",
    "@xmath64 is always the ground state ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the energy levels become degenerate in angular momentum when @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and @xcite ) .",
    "therefore at zero temperature , no vortex can be nucleated at @xmath42 under the dbc .",
    "0.751.0pc    we have plotted the energy as a function of the angular momentum for a fixed @xmath67 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for the landau problem of a charged particle in a transverse magnetic field a similar plot , but in a different geometry and only for positive angular momentum states , has been used in @xcite in order to describe the role of the edge states in the quantum hall transport . in the present problem as well as in the landau problem",
    "there is no sharp difference between edge and bulk states under dbc .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions do not provide a way to separate edge from bulk excitations . as already pointed out ,",
    "such a separation is necessary for the description of the nucleation of a vortex .",
    "we therefore propose a set of non - local and chiral boundary conditions which are more suitable for the present problem .",
    "these boundary conditions are akin to the one introduced by atiyah , patodi and singer ( aps ) in their study of index theorems for dirac operators with boundaries @xcite .",
    "similar boundary conditions have also been applied to the landau problem on manifolds with boundaries @xcite .",
    "these boundary conditions split the hilbert space into a direct sum of two orthogonal , _ infinite dimensional _ spaces with positive and negative chirality on the boundary .",
    "the chirality is determined by the direction of the azimuthal velocity projected on the boundary .",
    "a vortex is nucleated as a result of the transfer of a state from the edge to the bulk .",
    "we have already noticed that for a given value of the angular momentum @xmath68 , the current flows with a different chirality in regions separated by a ring of radius @xmath69 .",
    "we define the bulk and the edge regions using this particular value of @xmath45 as a reference for a given angular momentum .",
    "the current associated to that particular angular momentum is respectively paramagnetic and diamagnetic in the bulk and at the edge .",
    "alternatively , we define the bulk and at the edge states for a disc of size @xmath50 so that bulk states have angular momentum @xmath70 whereas edge states have @xmath71",
    ".    the azimuthal velocity @xmath72 , projected on the boundary of the disc has eigenvalues given by ( r)=(l -b_r^2)=(l- _ ) where @xmath73 .",
    "the chiral boundary conditions are now defined in the following way :    for @xmath74 , namely for @xmath75    _ r _ l|_r=0 [ neumann ] ( for any @xmath76 and henceforth we shall drop the subscript @xmath76 in @xmath77 . )    for @xmath78 , namely for @xmath79    ( + + b_r)_l|_r = r= 0 [ spectral1 ]    for the first set of wavefunctions that accounts for the edge states we use neumann boundary conditions .",
    "we could have used as well dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "however unlike neumann boundary conditions they give an unphysical discontinuity @xcite .",
    "these wavefunctions are more and more localized towards the outer side of the system for an increasing rotation frequency . for states",
    "@xmath79 , that corresponds to wavefunctions localized well inside the disc , we impose the mixed boundary condition ( [ spectral1 ] ) .",
    "it is this separation in the dispersion relations of the edge states under the choice of cbc that mimics the effect of interactions . in the many - body theory of vortex nucleation this separation",
    "is achieved by solving the bogoliubov equations under various approximations @xcite and then by identifying the collective excitations localized at the surface of the condensate .      according to the chiral boundary conditions when @xmath67 is increased at a fixed @xmath63 , the sign of the eigenvalues @xmath80 changes from the positive to the negative .",
    "correspondingly the energy @xmath81 of a state with a given @xmath76 and @xmath68 changes .",
    "this change in energy describes how the corresponding state is transferred from the edge hilbert space to the bulk hilbert space at the point @xmath82 ( [ neumann ] ) .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig4 ] . for large @xmath67 ,",
    "the infinite plane solutions ( [ eigv ] ) are reached asymptotically .    0.751.0pc",
    "0.751.0pc    for an infinite system we have @xmath83 .",
    "therefore @xmath84 , for a given @xmath63 , is a linear function of @xmath68 with slope @xmath85 .",
    "when chiral boundary conditions are applied , this behaviour is approximately obeyed for the bulk states .",
    "but for the edge states the energy increases non - linearly with increasing angular momentum .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "this is also the case for dirichlet boundary conditions ( fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "there is however a quantitative difference and moreover the bulk and the edge states are now separated under these chiral boundary conditions . for a given @xmath76",
    "the spectrum is continuous at the point @xmath86 , but its derivative is not .",
    "this has been shown in fig.[fig5 ] for the first two values of @xmath76 .",
    "the derivation of the spectrum under these boundary conditions is provided in detail in the appendix . here",
    "we focus on the nucleation of vortices under these boundary conditions .",
    "0.751.0pc    0.751.0pc    the fig.[fig6 ] shows the effect of an increase of the rotational frequency on the spectrum under the choice of cbc .",
    "we have plotted the energies of the bulk and the edge states for four different values of the ratio @xmath63 . for each value ,",
    "the quantity @xmath87 is increased by unit steps from @xmath88 to @xmath89 and the corresponding bulk and edge energies are shown . under these conditions , the slope of the bulk energy levels increases while the slope of the edge energy levels goes down .",
    "the opposite behaviour is observed when , for a fixed @xmath90 , the ratio @xmath63 increases .",
    "therefore with increasing rotational frequency , states with higher angular momenta are transferred from the edge hilbert space to the bulk hilbert space . the @xmath68-th angular momentum state is nucleated in the bulk from the edge by changing @xmath90 from @xmath68 to @xmath91 .",
    "the plots that appear in fig.[fig6 ] represent solutions of the stationary schr@xmath0dinger equation under the choice of cbc at different values of @xmath25 and @xmath90 . to understand the nucleation of vortices in the condensate with these solutions we use the fact that a condensate is rotated only by nucleating a vortex .",
    "therefore in between nucleations of successive vortices , the radius of the condensate remains constant .",
    "this is in contrast to the rotation of a rigid body which flattens out continuously while increasing the rotational frequency .",
    "let us denote by @xmath92 , the characteristic frequency for nucleation of the first vortex .",
    "for a given @xmath93 , the radius of the condensate is @xmath50 and it corresponds to @xmath94 .",
    "the corresponding bulk and edge energy levels for @xmath95 are obtained from ( [ neumann ] ) and ( [ spectral1 ] ) .",
    "the condensate is therefore the bulk region that contains only the @xmath96 state . at @xmath97 , the first vortex is nucleated by transferring the @xmath98 state from the edge to the bulk so that @xmath90 changes from @xmath88 to @xmath99 .",
    "therefore the condensate is now defined as the bulk region of @xmath100 and it has a larger radius .",
    "the rotational flux transferred by nucleating a vortex is thus @xmath101 since this is the unit of @xmath90 . at @xmath102 , the edge states for @xmath95",
    "intersects the bulk states for @xmath100 .",
    "this is energetically favoured since at @xmath103 , the energy @xmath104 of any state with @xmath105 is less if @xmath100 rather than @xmath95 . in the corresponding many body description @xcite",
    ", vortices are nucleated when at higher rotational frequency , a surface energy barrier disappears .",
    "the reduction of the edge state energy with the nucleation of a vortex is qualitatively similar to the disappearance of the surface energy barrier .    the characteristic rotational frequency for the nucleation of the first vortex determined using chiral boundary conditions ( [ neumann],[spectral1 ] ) is between @xmath106 and @xmath107 as shown in fig.[fig7 ] where @xmath28 is the transverse trap frequency .",
    "we note that this characteristic nucleation frequency is close to the value @xmath108 that has been observed in one of the experiments on vortex nucleation @xcite .",
    "all these features can not be derived from either the infinite plane or from dbc .    to establish a parallel with the case of superconductors",
    "let us mention similar results obtained for the vortex nucleation in a mesoscopic superconducting disc @xcite .",
    "however in a neutral superfluid there is no maxwell - amp@xmath109re equation that can relate the current to the induced rotation .",
    "thus far we have discussed the nucleation of the first vortex . here",
    "we discuss the bulk and edge spectrum under cbc for @xmath110 .",
    "we consider the following two cases :    1 .",
    "for a further increase of @xmath25 beyond @xmath111 , the edge states corresponding to @xmath112 crosses the bulk states of @xmath113 for @xmath114 ( fig.[fig6 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding rotational frequencies @xmath115 are the nucleation frequencies of the @xmath68-th vortices .",
    "each of these vortices is nucleated by changing @xmath90 to @xmath116 and it carries one unit of angular momentum .",
    "characteristic rotational frequencies are presented in the table [ one - vortex ] .",
    "since the bulk and edge energy spectra under cbc is obtained by solving the stationary schr@xmath0dinger equation in a co - rotating frame , solutions at different values of @xmath25 can be related one to the other if the rotation is switched on adiabatically .",
    "such experiments @xcite have been performed in a deformed rotating trap where the cross - section of the rotating condensate is an ellipse in the plane of rotation . here",
    "we solve the schr@xmath0dinger equation in a circular domain .",
    "this makes the comparison with the experimental results rather difficult . the theoretical work @xcite used an approach different from ours , to explain the nucleation mechanism of the first vortex .",
    "it should also be noticed that the adiabatic nucleation of successive vortices has not yet been observed experimentally .",
    "for a recent theoretical work on this issue see @xcite .",
    "one of the limitations of our theoretical frame - work is that we are unable to determine the spatial arrangement of more than one vortex inside the condensate .",
    "+ ._nucleation frequencies of successive ( @xmath98 ) vortices .",
    "_ [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]    + around @xmath117 , the number of vortices nucleated in this way increases very fast . experimentally @xcite it has been observed that under sudden switch - on of the rotation at higher rotational frequencies more than one vortices are nucleated and the number of nucleated vortices is the largest ,",
    "( see for example fig . 3 in @xcite ) at @xmath118 .",
    "this is associated with a resonant quadrupolar excitation of angular momentum @xmath119 .",
    "the energy of this quadrupolar surface mode in units of the transverse trap frequency is determined within the classical hydrodynamic approximation that is very different from our approach .",
    "therefore although our findings qualitatively agree with these experimental observations , a quantitative comparison with both the experiments and the related theory is rather involved .",
    "a reason for that is the difference in the trap geometry in the two - dimensional plane which is elliptical in the experiment while circular in our case .",
    "another reason is the different theoretical approach that have been used to study the surface excitations in the many - body theory @xcite and our .",
    "the difference between the characteristic rotational frequencies in the above two cases ( table [ one - vortex ] and [ many - vortex ] ) thus shows that the nucleation frequency of a vortex in the condensate depends on the number of vortices already present .",
    "0.751.0pc    the radius of the condensate is changed when a vortex is nucleated .",
    "since a boson in the condensate has one more unit of angular momentum when a vortex is nucleated , its orbit has a larger radius .",
    "this explains why size of the condensate region increases with successive nucleations .",
    "when the @xmath68-th vortex with one unit of angular momentum is nucleated , the condensate region corresponds to @xmath113 .",
    "therefore at each @xmath115 , the radius of the condensate region is defined as r_c|_=_l = between the nucleations of the @xmath68-th and @xmath120-th vortex , the radius of the bulk region for @xmath112 decreases as @xmath121 and the corresponding edge region grows in size . in fig.[fig8 ] using the set of frequencies listed in table [ one - vortex ] we have plotted the condensate radius . in the same figure we have simultaneously plotted the radius of the bulk region for @xmath112 , in between the nucleation of the @xmath68-th and @xmath122-th vortices .",
    "this plot involves a set of disconnected lines and the corresponding differences with the condensate region show how the edge region grows between the nucleation of two successive vortices . with the increase of the number of vortices in the condensate",
    "these two plots get closer one to the other . in the limit of a large number of vortices , the average rotation approaches the rigid body value @xcite .",
