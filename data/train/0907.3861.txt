    "low energy equilibria for crystalline materials are typically characterized by localized defects that interact with their environment through long - range elastic fields .",

    "sufficient accuracy can be obtained by the use of continuum models , which facilitate the reduction of degrees of freedom .",
    "the accuracy of the atomistic model at the defect combined with the efficiency of a continuum model for the far field enables , in principle , the reliable simulation of systems that are inaccessible to pure atomistic or pure continuum models .",
    "typical test problems for atomistic - to - continuum coupling methods have been dislocation formation under an indenter , crack tip deformation , and deformation and fracture of grain boundaries  @xcite . in each of these problems ,",
    "the crystal deforms quasistatically until the equilibrium equations become singular , for example , when a dislocation is formed or moves or when a crack tip advances .",
    "depending of the nature of the singularity , the crystal will then typically undergo a dynamic process when further loaded .    the quasicontinuum ( qc ) approximation models the continuum region by using an energy density that exactly reproduces the lattice - based energy density at uniform strain ( the cauchy - born rule ) .",
    "several variants of the qc approximation have been proposed that differ in how the atomistic and continuum regions are coupled  @xcite .",

    "other coupling models are analyzed in  @xcite .    in @xcite , we have begun to investigate whether the qc method can reliably predict the formation of defects . the main ingredient to establish whether or not this is the case is a sharp analysis to predict under which conditions the qc method is `` stable . ''",
    "more precisely , we ask whether there exist `` stable '' solutions of the qc method _ up to a critical load_. we have begun to investigate this question in some depth for the most common energy - based qc formulations in @xcite . in the present paper , we present a corresponding sharp stability analysis for the force - based quasicontinuum ( qcf ) method  @xcite .",

    "the uniform configuration ceases to be stable when the applied tensile strain reaches a critical value ( fracture ) .",
    "for the atomistic model and for energy - based qc formulations , coercivity ( positivity ) of the second variation evaluated at the equilibrium solution provides the natural notion of stability .",
    "however , the qcf method , which we describe in sections [ sec : model : qcf ] and [ sec : proj_forces ] , leads to non - conservative equilibrium equations , and therefore , positivity of the linearized qcf operator may be an inappropriate notion of stability . indeed , we prove in section [ sec : no_coercivity ] that , generically , the linearized qcf operator is indefinite .    as a consequence , we consider two further notions of stability .",
    "first , we investigate for which choices of discrete function spaces ( that is , for which choices of topologies ) does the linearized qcf operator have an inverse that is bounded uniformly in the size of the atomistic system . in section [ sec : qcf_ana : opstab ] , we present several sharp stability results as well as interesting counterexamples .",
    "however , these operator stability results do not necessarily correspond to any physical notion of stability .",
    "hence , in section [ sec : qcf_ana : dynstab ] , we propose the notion of _ dynamical stability _ , which can be reduced to certain properties of the eigenvalues .",
    "a careful numerical study suggests that the spectrum of the linearized qcf operator and that of the linearized quasi - nonlocal qc operator ( qnl ) ( see @xcite and section [ sec : qnl ] ) are identical . combined with our previous results @xcite",
    ", this indicates that the qcf method is _ dynamically stable _ up to the critical load for fracture .",
    "we consider deformations from the reference lattice @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a scaling that we will fix below . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we admit only deformations which are periodic displacements from the uniform state @xmath2 , that is , we admit deformations from the space @xmath3 we call @xmath4 the _ macroscopic deformation gradient _ , and we set @xmath5 throughout . although the energies and forces are defined for general @xmath6-periodic displacements , we only admit those with zero mean , as is common for continuum problems with periodic boundary conditions , in order to obtain unique solutions to the equilibrium equations .",
    "we consider only nearest - neighbor and next - nearest neighbor pair interactions so that the _ potential energy per period _ of a deformation @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 and where @xmath10 is a lennard - jones type interaction potential :    1 .",

    "we assume that the atomistic system is subject to @xmath6-periodic external forces @xmath18 with zero mean , i.e. , @xmath19 , so that the _ total energy per period _ takes the form @xmath20    equilibria @xmath7 of the atomistic total energy are solutions to the equilibrium equations @xmath21 where the ( scaled ) atomistic forces @xmath22 are defined by @xmath23 and where @xmath24 is the space of linear functionals on @xmath25 we remark that the translational invariance of the atomistic energy implies that @xmath26 has zero mean , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the unit translation vector .",

    "if we define @xmath256 then @xmath257 the solution to the above system of equations is @xmath258 which clearly satisfies the bound @xmath259 for all @xmath260 .",
    "thus , we can estimate @xmath261 where the condition number of @xmath253 is defined as usual by @xmath262 hence , we see that , subject to the validity of conjecture [ samespec ] , the @xmath133 operator satisfies with constant @xmath263 . to make this stability independent of @xmath134 , we require that @xmath264 is bounded as @xmath147 .",

    "conjectures  [ samespec ] and [ uniformcond ] , supported by the results of the numerical experiments that we have presented in tables [ tbl : qcf_ana : conj_evals ] and [ tbl : qcf_ana : condv ] , imply that @xmath247 is indeed dynamically stable for @xmath268 with a stability constant that is uniform in @xmath134 .",
    "we propose that a sharp stability analysis of atomistic - to - continuum coupling methods is an essential ingredient for the evaluation of their predictive capability , as important as a sharp consistency analysis . in the present paper , we have established such a sharp stability analysis for the force - based qc method , for a simple one - dimensional model problem .",
    "we have analyzed three notions of stability :    1 .",

    "this result is based on the numerical observation that the spectra of the qcf and qnl operators coincide .",
    "positivity and dynamical stability are equivalent for energy - based methods , and under suitable conditions and choices of function spaces they imply operator stability .",
    "however , the fact that the qcf method is non - conservative and gives rise to non - normal operators , leads to a much richer mathematical structure .",
    "finally , we stress once again that , while the qcf method is possibly the simplest force - based multi - physics coupling scheme , we believe that similar observations can be made for other force - based hybrid methods , such as feat @xcite , cadd @xcite or _ brutal force mixing _ @xcite .",

    "even though the variational representations of the dirichlet case and the periodic case are the same , we can not translate the proof for inf - sup stability that we used in @xcite , as it required a matrix representation that is unavailable for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "instead , we will compute a fairly explicit characterization of @xmath285 to estimate its norm directly .",

    "the second inequality follows from a similar argument .",
    "corollary [ th : lqcfinv_and_l1invlqcf ] shows that we can bound the operator norm @xmath307 in terms of @xmath308 .",
    "the latter operator norm can be computed using the formula @xmath309 in the next lemma , we establish an explicit representation of @xmath310 which will subsequently allow us to construct upper and lower bounds for .",
