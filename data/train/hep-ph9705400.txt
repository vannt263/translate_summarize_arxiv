    "if one considers the standard model ( sm ) as an effective theory , its remarkable success when confronted with experiment suggests the possibility that the dynamics underlying the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking resides at the tev scale or above . in particular , in a scenario without a light higgs boson",
    "the corresponding strong dynamics might manifest itself only at very high energies as the ones to be probed by the lhc . in some cases , however , the new dynamics can produce sizeable quantum effects in low energy observables .",
    "in this letter we study the effects of a strongly coupled symmetry breaking sector in rare @xmath0 and kaon decays . in the context of effective field theories , we concentrate on non - decoupling effects induced by operators not contributing to oblique corrections or to shifts in the couplings of three gauge bosons .",
    "one of the remaining operators , which induces @xmath8 corrections in charged interactions , was recently considered in @xcite where its effects in @xmath9 and @xmath10 mixing were estimated . the logarithmic dependence on the high energy scale @xmath11 is used to obtain approximate bounds on the corresponding coefficient in the low energy expansion .",
    "we will show that the bounds from these observables still allow for the possibility of large effects in transitions involving flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , most notably rare @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays . in the absence of a light higgs boson the symmetry breaking sector",
    "is represented by a non - renormalizable effective lagrangian corresponding to the non - linear realization of the sigma model .",
    "the essential feature is the spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry @xmath12 . to leading order the interactions involving the goldstone bosons associated with this mechanism and the gauge fields are described by @xmath13 + \\frac{v^2}{4}{{\\rm tr}}\\left[d_\\mu u^\\dagger d^\\mu u\\right ] , \\label{lo}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 $ ] are the the @xmath16 and @xmath17 field strengths respectively , the electroweak scale is @xmath18  gev and the goldstone bosons enter through the matrices @xmath19 .",
    "the covariant derivative acting on @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 . to this order",
    "there are no free parameters once the gauge bosons masses are fixed .",
    "the dependence on the dynamics underlying the strong symmetry breaking sector appears at next to leading order . a complete set of operators at next to leading order includes one operator of dimension two and nineteen operators of dimension four @xcite . the effective lagrangian to next to leading order in the basis of ref",
    ".  @xcite is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a dimension two custodial symmetry violating term absent in the heavy higgs limit of the sm . if we restrict ourselves to cp invariant structures , there remain fifteen operators of dimension four .",
    "the coefficients of some of these operators are constrained by low energy observables .",
    "for instance precision electroweak observables constrain the coefficient of @xmath23 , which gives a contribution to @xmath24 .",
    "the combinations @xmath25 and @xmath26 contribute to @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 modify the triple gauge boson couplings and are probed at lepii at the few percent level @xcite .",
    "the remaining operators either contribute to oblique corrections to one loop only or do not contribute . to the last group",
    "belong @xmath33 and @xmath34 given that their contributions to the gauge boson two - point functions only affect the longitudinal piece of the propagators .",
    "of particular interest is the operator @xmath33 defined by @xcite @xmath35 ,   \\label{defo11}\\ ] ] with @xmath36 and the covariant derivative acting on @xmath37 defined by @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "the equations of motion for the @xmath39 field strength imply @xcite @xmath40 where the @xmath17 current is @xmath41 .",
    "the dominant effect appears in the quark sector due to the presence of terms proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "after the quark fields are rotated to the mass eigenstate basis , the operator @xmath33 can be written as @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 , the @xmath45 are cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements and the dots stand for terms suppressed by small fermion masses . simple inspection of this form of @xmath33 as a four - fermion operator makes clear where these corrections will appear .",
    "@xcite the effects of @xmath33 in @xmath9 and @xmath10 mixing were studied and found to be binding on the value of @xmath46 . there , it was concluded that the mixing limit is slightly more stringent then the one coming from @xmath9 , even when the former is plagued with theoretical uncertainties . more generally , transitions involving fcnc are likely to be more sensitive to effects of this kind . in what follows",
    "we show that @xmath33 gives a very distinct pattern of potentially large deviations from the sm in rare @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays .",
    "operators of this type are also present in scenarios with a light higgs boson . in this case",
    "the sm symmetry breaking sector is linearly realized .",
    "using naive dimensional analysis @xcite we conclude that the analogous operators generating non - oblique corrections and expressible as four - fermion interactions are of dimension eight or higher and therefore are suppressed by additional powers of @xmath47 .",
    "thus the effects we discuss in this paper are of no significance in the presence of a light higgs boson .    in the next section",
    "we compute the effects induced in rare @xmath0 and @xmath1 processes by the four - fermion operators contained in @xmath33 .",
    "additional contributions to these decays from the next - to - leading order effective lagrangian in ( [ lnlo ] ) could come in the form of anomalous triple gauge boson couplings .",
    "we do not consider these corrections here .",
    "moreover , we assume the coupling of the new physics to fermions to be small and therefore neglect contributions from induced anomalous couplings of fermions to gauge bosons @xcite , which in any case are constrained by the bounds on oblique corrections .",
    "we summarize and discuss the results in the last section .",
    "the four - fermion operator in ( [ ffo11 ] ) @xmath48 induces contributions to several fcnc processes when inserted in a top loop , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "among them are @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 transitions ( @xmath52 ) as well as the analogous vertices relevant for rare k decays .",
    "the insertion of this non - renormalizable interaction results in a logarithmically divergent amplitude when computed using dimensional regularization .",
    "the divergences are absorbed by suitable counterterms .",
    "we will estimate the size of the effects by computing the logarithmic dependence on the high energy scale @xmath11 . in principle",
    ", there could be finite effects coming from the counterterms .",
    "however , unless large cancellations occur , the logarithmic dependence should give a good approximation of the effects @xcite .",
    "we will come back to discuss this point later in the paper .",
    "we begin with the modification of the @xmath2 vertex .",
    "this can be generically written as @xmath53 the second term in ( [ bsgamma ] ) gives the on - shell amplitude whereas the term proportional to @xmath54 only contributes to the vertex when the photon is off - shell .",
    "the computation of the corresponding diagram in fig .  1  ( a ) gives @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the top quark electric charge .",
    "as it was mentioned before , the value of @xmath54 in ( [ offshell ] ) corresponds to the logarithmic @xmath11 dependence and does not include possible finite counterterm contributions .",
    "however it gives the correct dependence on the high energy scale @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the leading corrections to @xmath3 processes are therefore governed by @xmath54 . from ( [ bis0 ] )",
    "we conclude that the operator @xmath33 does not induce an effect in @xmath2 processes at the one loop level . however , next to leading order corrections induced by the strong interactions will give a non - zero value of @xmath0 .",
    "the need to go to two loops is characteristic of the mixing of four - quark operators with the electromagnetic dipole operator in ( [ bsgamma ] ) . a typical contribution of this type",
    "is shown in fig .  1  ( b ) .",
    "we compute this mixing after fierz rearranging ( [ rareo11 ] ) into a product of currents and evolving the corresponding coefficient from the scale @xmath11 down to @xmath57 , where the matching to the effective weak hamiltonian is made .",
    "the dependence with the high energy scale now enters through the factor @xmath58 , to be compared with ( [ offshell ] ) where there is no @xmath59 suppression .",
    "the effect of the resummation of these logarithms through the renormalization group equations is small .",
    "the renormalization group running from @xmath57 down to @xmath60 produces the mixing of the four - quark operator with the second term in ( [ bsgamma ] ) .",
    "this gives , approximately @xmath61 \\alpha_{11 } \\left(\\frac{m_t}{v}\\right)^2 , \\label{bsmall}\\ ] ] where we have neglected a @xmath62 effect from the running between @xmath11 and @xmath57 , we define @xmath63 and the coefficients @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be found in @xcite . as we will discuss below , this two - loop contribution results in a small effect in @xmath2 processes .",
    "next we consider the @xmath66 vertex .",
    "the operator ( [ rareo11 ] ) adds the contribution @xmath67 with @xmath68 the @xmath17 gauge coupling and @xmath69 the cosine of the weinberg angle .",
    "the additional factor of @xmath8 in ( [ bsz ] ) when compared to @xmath70 in ( [ bsgamma ] ) and ( [ offshell ] ) comes from the axial - vector coupling of the @xmath71 boson , which here gives the leading contribution .    at this point and before estimating the effects of @xmath33 in rare decays , we incorporate the constraints on the quantity @xmath72 , characterizing the new physics contributions .",
    "implicit in this procedure is the assumption that the contributions of finite counterterms do not change significantly the size of the contribution .",
    "furthermore , there are extensions of the sm where there are no finite counterterms at the scale @xmath11 .",
    "neglecting the counterterm contributions allows one to correlate the effects of the new dynamics in various observables , given that these are proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "the upper limit for @xmath73 that is obtained from the analysis of @xmath74 and @xmath10 mixing in @xcite corresponds to @xmath75 .",
    "a more conservative estimate using a higher value for @xmath76 @xcite and assuming a @xmath77 uncertainty in the value of @xmath78 yields @xmath79",
    ". a lower limit on @xmath73 can be derived by comparing the experimental value @xcite @xmath80 with the sm expectation of @xmath81 .",
    "noting that @xcite @xmath82 the @xmath83 c.l .",
    "lower limit is @xmath84 .",
    "this limit is largely driven by the fact that @xmath9 is larger that the sm prediction by about @xmath85 .",
    "for instance , had the central value of @xmath9 agreed with the sm , the @xmath83 c.l .",
    "lower limit would be @xmath86 .",
    "the induced vertices of eqns .",
    "( [ bsgamma ] ) and ( [ bsz ] ) translate into deviations from the sm predictions for @xmath0 decays governed by the @xmath2 and @xmath3 transitions .",
    "they can be expressed as shifts in the wilson coefficients in the weak effective hamiltonian @xmath87 with the operator basis defined in ref .",
    "@xcite . from eqn .",
    "( [ bsmall ] ) we see that there is a small shift in the coefficient @xmath88 of the electromagnetic dipole operator , @xmath89 .",
    "the renormalization group induced mixing of @xmath33 with @xmath90 translates into a shift for this coefficient of the order of @xmath91 .",
    "for instance , for a typical value of @xmath92 tev the bounds on @xmath73 discussed above give @xmath93 which gives a shift of at most @xmath94 in the coefficient @xmath95 determining the @xmath96 amplitude .",
    "the coefficient @xmath97 of the operator @xmath98 is affected almost exclusively by the shift in the off - shell photon vertex ( [ offshell ] ) given that the contribution to it from the @xmath71 exchange is proportional to @xmath99 .",
    "on the other hand , the induced vertex in ( [ bsz ] ) produces a significant shift in @xmath100 , the wilson coefficient corresponding to the operator @xmath101 .",
    "we make use of next - to - leading order qcd results for @xmath102 @xcite . on the other hand , the coefficient @xmath103 and",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "the entire analysis above is also valid for @xmath104 with the replacements @xmath105 and @xmath106 , given that we have neglected @xmath107 effects . in fig .  2 ( solid line ) we estimate the size of the effect in @xmath108 decays by plotting the ratio @xmath109 as a function of the quantity @xmath73 .",
    "we consider a range of values of @xmath73 compatible with the limits from @xmath9 and @xmath110 mixing as discussed above .",
    "we observe that for positive ( negative ) values of @xmath46 the branching ratio can be enhanced ( suppressed ) by up to a factor of about two .",
    "for instance , the sm prediction for the @xmath111 branching fraction is about @xmath112 .",
    "thus , the maximum enhancement in @xmath113 would take this mode to @xmath114 .",
    "however , it should be noted that the effect does not necessarily affect all _ exclusive _ branching ratios equally .",
    "for instance , the @xmath115 branching fraction follows @xmath113 , whereas this is not the case for @xmath116 , where the interplay of the various combinations of wilson coefficients with the helicity amplitudes gives a quantitatively different answer ( e.g. for @xmath117 the enhancement is @xmath118 , for @xmath119 the suppression is small ) . on the other hand , in these modes",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry for leptons is very sensitive to these type of changes in the wilson coefficients @xcite .",
    "current experimental upper limits on exclusive modes are already at the @xmath120 level @xcite and sensitivity to sm branching ratios will be achieved in the near future .",
    "the modification of the @xmath66 vertex ( [ bsz ] ) also induces an effect in @xmath4 processes . defining the ratio @xmath121 analogously to ( [ defrat ] ) and plotting it versus @xmath73 in fig .  2 ( dashed line ) we see that the effect of @xmath33 in these decays approximately follows @xmath113 .",
    "the sm expectation is @xmath122 .",
    "the current @xmath123 c.l .",
    "upper limit from lep @xcite is @xmath124 , which is still not constraining when compared with @xmath121 .",
    "the operator @xmath33 also induces corrections to the wilson coefficients of qcd penguin operators in the effective weak hamiltonian .",
    "for instance the modification of the @xmath5 vertex due to ( [ rareo11 ] ) is @xmath125 leading to shifts in the coefficients of the qcd penguin operators @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , but not affecting the gluonic dipole operator . in order to estimate the size of the effect we compute the branching fraction for the pure qcd penguin process @xmath130 .",
    "the ratio @xmath131 , defined analogously to ( [ defrat ] ) is plotted in fig .  2 ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "the deviation with respect to the sm is slightly reduced in this case when compared to the semileptonic cases .",
    "furthermore , the theoretical uncertainties associated with the observable exclusive modes are rather large and might obscure any new physics effects @xcite . in any case",
    ", we see the same correlation with the sign of @xmath73 as in @xmath113 and @xmath121 .",
    "finally , we turn to study the effects of the operator @xmath33 in the kaon system .",
    "these are induced by the last term in ( [ rareo11 ] ) .",
    "we focus on the semileptonic decays affected by the modification of the @xmath132 vertex , which allows us to concentrate on the theoretically cleaner modes . for the cp violating mode @xmath7 the ratio to the sm branching fraction , @xmath133 , is identical to @xmath121 and is therefore given by the dashed line in fig .  2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the equivalent ratio for the @xmath6 decay depends mildly on the cp violation parameters @xmath134 and @xmath135 as they appear in the wolfenstein parametrization @xcite of the ckm matrix , as well as on @xmath136 .",
    "the ratio @xmath137 is shown in fig .",
    "3 ( solid line ) as a function of @xmath73 .",
    "it can be seen that the pattern of deviation from the sm is very similar to that of the neutral mode as well as to the one observed in rare @xmath0 decays .",
    "the current experimental limit on the charged mode is @xmath138 @xcite whereas the sm predictions are in the vicinity of @xmath139 .",
    "thus it is likely that experiments in the near future will have sensitivity at the sm level .",
    "similar effects will be present in other decay modes , for instance @xmath140 , @xmath141 , etc.however , these decays are contaminated by potentially large long distance contributions @xcite .",
    "in a scenario without a light higgs boson the electroweak sector is non - linearly realized and most likely underlied by strong dynamics .",
    "we have studied the effects of such a scenario in rare @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays . these originate almost exclusively in one operator in the next - to - leading order effective lagrangian for the goldstone bosons , given that its effects are proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "the dependence on the high energy scale @xmath11 resulting from the insertion of the operator @xmath33 given in ( [ rareo11 ] ) in fcnc loops is given by the factor @xmath142 .",
    "we further assume this dependence to be the leading contribution to the amplitudes . in doing",
    "so we neglect possible finite contributions from counterterms coming from the matching at the scale @xmath11 .",
    "this allows us to correlate the effects in several observables .",
    "we have shown that , even after imposing the bounds on @xmath73 from @xmath9 and @xmath143 mixing , large effects on rare @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays remain , as can be seen in figs .  2 and  3 .",
    "a very distinct pattern of deviations from the sm emerges .",
    "positive values of @xmath73 give similar enhancements of up to a factor of almost two in @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath130 and other qcd gluonic penguin decays , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , whereas negative values of @xmath46 imply a similar suppression of up to a factor of two in all these processes .",
    "other modes , such as @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 , are similarly affected but we concentrated on those processes that are both theoretically clean and most accessible to present and future experiments .",
    "the effects of the operator @xmath33 in on - shell photon processes as @xmath2 , @xmath149 , etc .",
    "are only induced by the two - loop strong interaction mixing and are expected to be rather small when compared with those in the leptonic and semileptonic modes for the same values of the parameter @xmath73 .",
    "both the correlation among different processes as well as the size of the effects are well approximated by the logarithmic behavior as long as there are no large cancellations due to counterterms .",
    "moreover , in extensions of the sm where the new dynamics associated with the electroweak symmetry breaking does not couple appreciably to fermions , there will be no counterterms and the observed correlation among processes is not just an expected pattern but a quantitatively valid statement stemming from the calculation of the effects .",
    "this is consistent with our assumption of no anomalous couplings of fermions to gauge bosons .    regarding the size of the coefficient @xmath46 we note that , for a high energy scale of e.g. @xmath150  tev , its value is allowed to be @xmath151 .",
    "we have not made an attempt to estimate the size of this coefficient in extensions of the sm . in the scenario considered in this work ,",
    "the new dynamics is strongly coupled and the coefficients of the effective lagrangian can be large .    finally , we point out that this is one more example of deviations occurring at the same level in both rare @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays .",
    "this is characteristic of new physics entering in loop - induced fcnc as long as the new dynamics couples equally to all generations . in this way ,",
    "@xmath8 effects associated with the electroweak symmetry breaking affect similarly fcnc with external down - type quarks . therefore the experimental information from both types of processes is essential in disentangling the source of the effect in scenarios like the present one .",
    "experiments designed to achieve sensitivity to the sm branching fractions , such as leptonic and hadronic @xmath0 factories and high intensity kaon experiments can have interesting consequences for the physics at the high energy scale @xmath11 even when this can only be directly probed at the lhc .",
