    "the absolute calibration of iacts is usually obtained from the lab measurement of the efficiency and gain of each detector element ( light collecting mirrors , photo - detectors , electronics , etc . ) .",
    "the resulting calibration can be compared with muon arc images @xcite although complications may arise from the differences in the wavelength spectrum of the light from muons and from the gamma ray showers of interest .",
    "instrument performance is often monitored using relative calibration techniques @xcite .",
    "the availability of a calibrated fast pulsed light source in the the sky would make the absolute calibration of these telescopes more straightforward and reliable . using the work done for atmospheric fluorescence detectors of ultra high energy cosmic rays @xcite @xcite as a guide",
    ", we have obtained a preliminary absolute calibration of the veritas telescope 1 by measuring the rayleigh scattered light from a pulsed laser shot toward zenith .",
    "the technique relies on the fact that for a known laser pulse energy and atmospheric temperature and pressure , the amount of rayleigh scattered light reaching the telescope to be calibrated can be computed with high accuracy and compared with the signal amplitude actually recorded .",
    "the veritas experiment @xcite is an array of four 12 m telescopes under construction at kitt peak in southern arizona .",
    "each telescope camera consists of 499 @xmath0 spaced photo - multipliers arranged in a close packed hexagonal lattice covering a full field of view of @xmath1 .",
    "the first telescope to be constructed has been temporarily installed on the foothills of mt - hopkins at the base - camp of the whipple observatory @xcite .",
    "the calibration technique outlined above is complicated by fluctuating amounts of aerosols present in the atmosphere .",
    "because of mie scattering , aerosols increase the amount of light scattered off the laser beam .",
    "this is somewhat compensated by the correspondingly increased atmospheric attenuation from the laser to the telescopes . as a result",
    ", there is a specific distance between the laser and the telescope for which the effects of aerosol fluctuations cancel out .",
    "this distance depends on the details of the aerosol properties and has been shown to fall in the range of 3 to 5 km @xcite for horizontal observation .",
    "for the preliminary tests reported in this article , a nitrogen laser ( 337 nm ) pointed at zenith is installed 3.0  km away from the telescope .",
    "the telescope is pointed at the laser @xmath2 above the horizon and intercepts the laser when it reaches an altitude of @xmath3 above ground level .",
    "each laser pulse has a duration of 4 ns and an average energy of @xmath4 with a 2% standard deviation .",
    "the pulse remains within the field of view for @xmath5 and moves across one @xmath0 pixel in @xmath6 .",
    "the telescope is focused at infinity and the laser pulse produces a spot in the focal plane corresponding to @xmath7 . as a consequence , a given pixel can receive light from the laser pulse for as long as 60 ns .",
    "this also permits the laser flash to satisfy the trigger conditions , which require 3 pixels to exceed their threshold within @xmath8 .",
    "figure 1 shows the pixel map of one laser event . in these measurements we only recorded 124 samples ( 248 ns ) from the fadc which",
    "is why the laser beam image does not extend all across the entire field of view .",
    "the pulse width and relative timing are consistent with the geometrical considerations outlined above .",
    "the veritas system should allow the recording of signals for as long as @xmath9 , so modifications to the acquisition software will permit longer integrations to be made in subsequent measurements .",
    "a laser event image is shown on the left .",
    "each circle symbolizes one camera pixel the area of the grey disks indicate the time integrated signal from that pixel .",
    "the fadc traces are shown on the right for three pixels both in a real event ( solid line ) and in a simulated event ( dotted line ) .",

    "in order to analyze the data obtained with the telescope , we developed a detailed simulation of the experiment .",
    "the rayleigh scattered light @xcite is simulated according to the measured laser pulse energy ( @xmath10 ) , local temperature ( @xmath11 ) and pressure ( @xmath12 ) and taking into account the geometry of the setup .",
    "for this preliminary analysis , we have assumed the atmosphere to be locally isothermal . the telescope response to the flash of rayleigh",
    "scattered light was obtained by using the grisu simulation package @xcite . in the simulation , we positioned the laser to reproduce the event shown in figure 1 .",
    "we selected 39 channels for which we calculated the average pulse integral both from 29 real events and from 29 simulated events .",
    "the simulated events appeared to contain less signal than the real events by @xmath13 where the error is statistical only .",
    "this result can be verified on a pixel by pixel basis as in figure 2 .",
    "although this figure illustrates the accuracy of our simulations , it should not be used to obtain an absolute calibration for individual channels since the contents of each pixel depends strongly on the precise position of the laser beam image in the field .",
    "in fact , figure 2 results from optimizing the position of the simulated laser beam image to obtain the strongest correlation between simulated and real pixel contents .",
    "the resulting similarity of simulated and real data can be further verified by comparing pulse shapes as in figure 1 .",
    "the systematic error is dominated by the residual effects from mie scattering on aerosols .",
    "this is further complicated in our observation by the observing angle , which makes us sensitive to the aerosol vertical distribution .",
    "systematic limitations can be obtained experimentally and optimized by observing the night to night fluctuations and minimizing them by adjusting the distance from the laser to the telescope .     for each of the 39 selected pixels",
    "the averaged pulse integrals for 29 real events are shown as a function of the averaged pulse integrals for 29 simulated events .",

    "the first results of this absolute calibration method applied to an imaging cherenkov telescope are very promising .",
    "further improvement will come from the elimination of the image time truncation , which complicates the analysis .",
    "the local atmosphere model must be improved to allow for non - isothermal conditions .",
    "the effects of the distance from the laser to the telescope still have to be investigated for a better understanding of the systematics .",
