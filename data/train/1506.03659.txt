    "characterization of quatum processes represents an indispensable tool for testing , optimization , and benchmarking of quantum information processing devices .",
    "a complete characterization of a quantum device can be provided by quantum process tomography @xcite , but this technique becomes very time consuming with increasing complexity of the device , unless special procedure such as compressed sensing can be applied @xcite , because the number of parameters that need to be estimated scales exponentially with the number of qubits .    instead of full quantum tomography we may just attempt to obtain an indication how close we are to the target operation , as quantified by the quantum process fidelity .",
    "monte carlo sampling has been proposed for efficient estimation of fidelity of multiqubit states and operations with resources scaling polynomially with the estimation precision @xcite .",
    "yet another experimentally appealing option is represented by the hofmann bounds on quantum process fidelity @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "a lower and upper bound on fidelity with a unitary operation is determined from measurements of average output state fidelities for input states forming two mutually unbiased bases .",
    "this latter approach is particularly efficient for characterization of few - qubit operations and it can be used e.g. for preliminary benchmarking of a quantum device during its design and optimization before a more complete characterization is carried out at the optimal operating point . during recent years , the hofmann bound has been successfully utilized for experimental characterization of various two - qubit and three - qubit quantum gates @xcite .",
    "the hofmann bound was designated to provide bounds on quantum process fidelity with a deterministic unitary operation . here",
    "we generalize this technique and propose and investigate hofmann - like quantum process fidelity bounds for special kind of probabilistic quantum operations called quantum filters .",
    "quantum filters are completely positive trace decreasing maps that can be represented by a single kraus operator @xmath0 .",
    "quantum filters form an important tool in many branches of quantum information science and beyond and they find applications e.g. in quantum state engineering , entanglement distillation @xcite , or quantum state discrimination @xcite .    our derivation of the generalized hofmann bounds for quantum filters is based on operator inequalities that are at the heart of the original hofmann bound .",
    "in contrast to unitary operations , where measurement of state fidelities for two complementary bases is sufficient , in case of quantum filters one generally needs to perform an additional set of measurements , which essentially characterizes the performance of the filter in a basis of its eigenstates . the number of measurements can be kept the same as for unitary operations provided that one of the two input bases is formed by the right eigenstates of @xmath0 . in this case",
    "it can be also proved that the resulting lower and upper bounds on quantum process fidelity are tight in the sense that for a perfect filter the bounds are always equal to @xmath1 .",
    "the probabilistic and non - unitary nature of the quantum filters thus leads to a symmetry breaking and occurrence of a preferred set of probe input states .",
    "we explicitly consider two bases connected via fourier transform and also two @xmath2-qubit bases connected by hadamard transform on each qubit .    as an illustration",
    ", we theoretically investigate characterization of a two - qubit optical quantum filter formed by interference of two photons on a partially polarizing beam splitter followed by post - selection of detection of a single photon at each output port of the beam splitter .",
    "this filter is utilized in various linear optical quantum information processing devices such as linear optical quantum gates @xcite .",
    "we consider experimentally convenient choice of input probe states for which the required output state fidelities can be directly determined by product single - qubit measurements . we show that as a consequence of this basis choice the resulting upper and lower bounds are not tight .",
    "we numerically find the ultimate upper and lower bounds for the same data using the semidefinite programming approach . in this way",
    "we illustrate that for the considered quantum filter and the available data more stringent bounds can be obtained by more sophisticated processing of the data and we compare the two methods also for different choice of basis states .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : boundsforfilters ] we review the original hofmann bound on fidelity of a deterministic process with a fixed unitary process and we generalize this bound to quantum filters . in section [ sec : ppbs ] we study quantum filter formed by interference of two photons on a partially polarizing beam splitter and section [ sec : conclusions ] contains the conclusions .",
    "finally , the appendix contains a proof of an alternative lower bound for @xmath2-qubit filters and some technical derivations .",
    "in general any quantum operation can be represented using choi - jamiolkowski isomorphism @xcite by positive - semidefinite operators . in this way a quantum filter @xmath3 is represented by an operator @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 denotes a maximally entangled state and @xmath7 is an orthonormal basis of a @xmath8-dimensional hilbert space @xmath9 .",
    "fidelity between the actually implemented quantum operation @xmath10 and the ideal quantum filter @xmath11 can be defined via state fidelity between normalized choi operators @xcite , @xmath12 our aim is to propose a procedure that would lower and upper bound this fidelity based on measured state fidelities of output states with respect to the ideal output for several input states . to do this we first review the original hofmann bound for deterministic operations in @xmath8 dimensions @xcite and",
    "then we generalize it so that it will become applicable to non - unitary quantum filters .",
    "suppose @xmath7 , @xmath13 are two orthonormal bases of @xmath9 that are mutually related by discrete fourier transform , i.e. @xmath14 we denote by @xmath15 , @xmath16 the ideal output states of a unitary transformation @xmath17 .",
    "density matrices @xmath18 and @xmath19 of output states produced by the actually implemented operation @xmath10 from the input states @xmath20 , @xmath21 can be expressed as @xmath22 where the transposition is taken with respect to the basis @xmath20 used in the choi - jamiolkowski isomorphism .",
    "the average output state fidelities for the two sets of probe states are defined as follows @xmath23 the hofman lower bound on quantum process fidelity @xcite @xmath24 can be proved as follows . for deterministic transformations @xmath25 ,",
    "hence the bound ( [ eg : hfbound1 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath26 the validity of the inequality ( [ eq : hfboundtes ] ) would be guaranteed by showing the positive - semidefiniteness of an operator @xmath27 , where @xmath28 if @xmath29 then @xmath30 due to positivity of @xmath31 , which implies the inequality ( [ eq : hfboundtes ] ) .",
    "as we show in the appendix [ sec : positivityofr ] the operator @xmath32 can be rewritten ( in the term to term fashion ) as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an orthonormal basis of maximally entangled states in @xmath8 dimensions .    from the above equation it is clear that @xmath35 , which implies @xmath29 and this proves the original hofmann bound . in a similar fashion , the upper bounds on quantum process fidelity @xmath36",
    ", @xmath37 can be derived from the following two operator inequalities @xmath38    next , we will use the operator @xmath32 to derive lower and upper bound on the fidelity of quantum filters .",
    "let us multiply @xmath32 by @xmath39 from the left and by @xmath40 from the right .",
    "( [ eq : hfopr ] ) we obtain @xmath41 where the inequality follows from @xmath35 . by taking the trace with @xmath10 eq .",

    "read @xmath50 where @xmath51 , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the relative success probabilities of operation @xmath10 for input basis states @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . these relative probabilities",
    "satisfy @xmath54 .",
    "formula ( [ eq : krkineq2 ] ) generalizes the hofmann lower bound ( [ eg : hfbound1 ] ) to quantum filters and represents one of our main results .",
    "we can see that the fidelity of a quantum filter is lower bounded by an expression which contains two weighted sums of the output state fidelities @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which generalizes the average state fidelities @xmath57 and @xmath58 appearing in the original hofmann bound .",
    "the last term on the right - hand side of inequality ( [ eq : krkineq2 ] ) provides a generalization of the factor @xmath59 to quantum filters and depends both on the ideal filter @xmath0 and also on the actual operation @xmath10 through @xmath60 .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : krkineq1 ] ) that the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : krkineq2 ] ) should be performed only over those terms for which the overlap @xmath61 or @xmath62 is nonzero .",
    "this also ensures that the normalized output states ( [ efnormalized ] ) are well defined .    a most straightforward way to experimentally determine the output state fidelities and relative success probabilities @xmath63 and @xmath64 consists in measuring the output state @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) in a basis including the corresponding output state @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) produced by an ideal filter . for quantum filters @xmath67 and",
    "@xmath68 generally do not form a basis which means that a separate measurement basis must be set for each probe state .",
    "besides testing the unknown quantum transformation with @xmath69 input states @xmath7 , @xmath13 , we also need to determine the term @xmath70 by some measurements . to construct a suitable measurement , consider a singular value decomposition of @xmath0 , @xmath71 where the left and right eigenvectors @xmath72 , @xmath73 form two orthonormal bases and the non - negative singular values were chosen in the form @xmath74 to simplify subsequent formulas . as a consequence the positive - semidefinite operators @xmath75 , @xmath76 have the following spectral decompositions @xmath77 in principle , we can determine @xmath70 from suitable measurements on any @xmath8 input states forming an orthonormal basis ( e.g. vectors @xmath78 ) .",
    "let @xmath79 and @xmath80 denote the unnormalized and normalized output state corresponding to the input state @xmath78 , and similarly as before we define the relative success probability for this input state as @xmath81 .",
    "the term @xmath82 can then be expressed as @xmath83 the relative success probabilities @xmath84 as well as the overlaps of output states @xmath85 with @xmath72 can be determined by measuring each output state @xmath85 in the basis formed by the eigenstates @xmath72 .",
    "at this point it is useful to realize that the experimental effort can be kept the same as for @xmath0 being unitary at the price of a suitable choice of basis @xmath20 and consequently @xmath21 .",
    "thus , if we choose @xmath86 and also @xmath87 then @xmath88 and the data for input states @xmath20 measured after the filter in basis @xmath89 can be used to determine the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : krkineq2 ] ) , i.e. @xmath90 , @xmath91 @xmath92 .",
    "after some algebra we find that the lower bound now equals to @xmath93 where @xmath94 and we used the identity @xmath95 , which holds since the two bases @xmath20 and @xmath21 are related by quantum fourier transform .",
    "an important property of the lower bound is its tightness .",
    "especially , if the implemented transformation is the desired one , then fidelity @xmath96 and we want our lower bound to attain the value @xmath1 as well .",
    "if the implementation of the filter is perfect , then @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "if we insert these expressions into eq .",
    "( [ eq : krkineqfin ] ) then we get @xmath99 which confirms that the lower bound ( [ eq : krkineqfin ] ) is tight for any quantum filter @xmath0 .",
    "note that this tightness is achieved due to the special choice of the probe states , where @xmath20 coincide with the right eigenvectors of @xmath0 .",
    "for other choices of the probe states the lower bound ( [ eq : krkineq2 ] ) is generally not tight and can be strictly lower than @xmath1 even for a perfect filter .",
    "this should be contrasted with the original hofmann bound ( [ eg : hfbound1 ] ) which always attains value @xmath1 if the target unitary @xmath17 is implemented perfectly , irrespective of the choice of the two probe bases .",
    "the nonunitarity of the filter @xmath0 thus leads to a symmetry breaking and emergence of preferred states suitable for benchmarking of the filter .    in a very similar fashion as above also a pair of upper bounds can be derived @xmath100 if we start from inequalities @xmath101 that are equivalent to the inequalities ( [ upperinequalities ] ) .",
    "for the special choice of probe states @xmath86 the upper bounds simplify to @xmath102 similarly as the lower bound ( [ eq : krkineqfin ] ) , also the upper bounds ( [ eq : krkinequp ] ) are tight in the sense that they yield @xmath103 if the filter is implemented perfectly .    from the application point of view",
    ", the @xmath2-qubit systems whose hilbert space is endowed with tensor product structure and @xmath104 are particularly relevant . in this case",
    "a natural choice of @xmath20 could be the computational basis formed by tensor products of single - qubit states @xmath105 and @xmath106 . by its construction ,",
    "discrete quantum fourier transform of the @xmath2-qubit computational basis states leads to product @xmath2-qubit states @xmath21 .",
    "this is good for experiments , since preparation of product states is often much simpler than preparation of entangled states .",
    "unfortunately , for most quantum filters at least some ( ideal ) output quantum states for the above inputs are entangled .",
    "for that reason it might be useful to study also other pairs of input bases , which could be tested more easily .",
    "one such combination can be the computational basis and the hadamard basis formed by tensor products of states @xmath107 .",
    "as we show in the appendix  [ sec : altlb ] the above derived lower and upper bounds hold also for this latter setting .",
    "the hofmann bound ( [ eg : hfbound1 ] ) proved particularly useful for characterization of various linear optical quantum gates @xcite .",
    "as a case study , we therefore investigate here a characterization of a quantum filter acting on polarization state of two photons .",
    "the filtering is realized by interference of the photons on a partially polarizing beam splitter ( ppbs ) followed by postselection of events when a single photon is observed at each output port of the beam splitter . in the basis of vertical and horizontal polarizations",
    ", the resulting two - qubit quantum filter reads @xmath108 where @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , @xmath112 denote the amplitude transmittances and reflectances of ppbs for horizontal and vertical polarizations , respectively .",

    "ideal implementation of the filter is assumed , hence the true fidelity @xmath96 and is depicted by the blue dashed line .",
    "the gap between the two lines illustrates the tightness of the bound . ]",
    "we will investigate further only the case @xmath116 , since this element is often used in optical quantum information processing experiments and its fidelity should be assessed . in this case",
    "the filter becomes diagonal , @xmath117 .",
    "choosing @xmath118 as the computational basis in which the filter is diagonal would for probe states @xmath21 lead to measurements on output states in an entangled basis , which is problematic in many optical experimental setups .",
    "instead , we will introduce alternative probe states that require just preparations and measurements in product bases .",
    "the idea is to employ the following pair of bases , @xmath119 the choice of these probe states is motivated by previous experiments , where bounds on fidelity of a quantum controlled - not gate and controlled - z gate were determined @xcite .",
    "the two bases ( [ probestates ] ) are related via a hadamard transform on each qubit , @xmath120 , and this relation together with the factorized form of the basis states @xmath20 and @xmath21 ensures that the lower and upper fidelity bounds ( [ eq : krkineq2 ] ) and ( [ eq : krkinequp0 ] ) are applicable , c.f .",
    "also appendix b. the practical advantage of the probe states ( [ probestates ] ) is that the filter @xmath0 maps them on product states , @xmath121 where @xmath122     on the actual intensity transmittance @xmath115 of the ppbs for four different target transmittances @xmath123 ( a ) , @xmath124 ( b ) , @xmath125 ( c ) , and @xmath126 ( d ) .",
    "the true fidelity of the filter is depicted by blue dashed lines . ]",
    "since the filter @xmath0 is not diagonal in any of the two probe bases ( [ probestates ] ) , additional measurements are required to estimate the term @xmath127 .",
    "a natural choice is to employ the computational basis states as additional probes @xmath78 and measure the resulting output states in the computational basis .",
    "mathematically , we have @xmath128 and @xmath129 the above outlined procedure to test the unknown quantum filter requires @xmath130 product input states and each output state needs to be measured in a single product basis . for comparison",
    ", full quantum process tomography of a two - qubit quantum filter @xcite would typically involve about @xmath131 different combinations of input states and output measurements .",
    "thus , characterization of the filter via the generalized hofmann bounds requires much less resources .",
    "let us now discuss the tightness of the lower bound ( [ eq : krkineq2 ] ) for our choice of the filter and the probe states .",
    "a detailed analysis reveals that in the present case this bound is tight for the ideal quantum filter , i.e. equal to one , only if @xmath132 or @xmath133 , where @xmath115 .",
    "otherwise there is a gap , which is smaller than @xmath134 if the desired ppbs has @xmath135 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : tightness1 ] .",
    "we also considered the situation where the actual value of the transmittance @xmath136 differs from the desired one .",
    "the dependence of the lower bound on the actual value of @xmath136 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff1 ] for four different desired values of @xmath136 .",
    "the results indicate that the proposed lower bound works well for @xmath135 .",
    "however , for @xmath137 the bound quickly becomes too loose to be useful .",
    "this opens the question what are the best upper and lower bounds on fidelity given certain data from experiment .",
    "such a question can be precisely answered by semidefinite programming @xcite , since the fidelity and the constraints given by the measured data are linear in @xmath138 .",
    "thus , we might write @xmath139 where the matrices @xmath140 and parameters @xmath141 capture the linear constraints provided by the data . to make our formulation of these constraints sufficiently general ,",
    "consider a set of input probe states @xmath142 forming a basis , where each output state is measured in a generally different basis @xmath143 .",
    "let @xmath144 denote the measured frequencies which sample the theoretical probabilities @xmath145 using the identity @xmath146 we can express the set of constraints on @xmath147 imposed by the data @xmath144 as follows , @xmath148 in our present case , each probe basis @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath72 provides a set of @xmath149 linearly independent constraints .    to test the performance of this approach",
    ", we used it to find the best upper and lower bounds from the data that we generated for @xmath150 randomly chosen quantum operations @xmath10 that were constructed as a random mixture of an ideal quantum filter @xmath0 and some other randomly chosen filter @xmath151 .",
    "the optimization ( [ sdp ] ) was performed numerically with the use of cvx , a package for specifying and solving convex programs @xcite . for a given random quantum filter @xmath10",
    "we also compute the analytical lower and upper fidelity bounds according to our procedure and the true fidelity . in figure [",
    "fig : numresults ] we plot the obtained results as a function of the true fidelity , hence the graph of the true fidelity forms a straight line with a unit slope . for comparison , we consider probing with two sets of input states .",
    "the first set is specified by eq .",
    "( [ probestates ] ) and requires only product measurements on output states , but the analytical bounds are not tight .",
    "the second set of probe states is constructed such that it leads to a tight analytical bounds ( [ eq : krkineqfin ] ) and ( [ eq : krkinequp ] ) at the price of the requirement of measurements in entangled basis for some of the output states .",
    "interestingly , the approach based on semidefinite programming provides in both cases tight bounds , i.e. for ideal implementation of the filter the upper and lower bounds coincide and @xmath152 .",
    "in summary , we designed and analyzed bounds on quantum process fidelity @xmath114 of a specific type of nondeterministic operations called quantum filters . these operations are mathematically characterized as completely positive maps , which can be expressed by a single kraus operator @xmath0 .",
    "operationally they correspond to operations which succeed only with a limited probability that depends on the input state and they map any pure state again to pure state .",
    "the proposed bounds represent a generalization of the original hofmann bounds on fidelity of unitary transformations @xcite . for quantum filters ,",
    "the average state fidelities are replaced with specific weighted averages , and the lower bound contains also an additional term that depends both on the desired and the actual operation . as a consequence , in addition to determination of relative success rates and output state fidelities for two sets of input basis states ,",
    "further measurements are generally needed .",
    "nevertheless , we show that the number of input states and measurements can be kept the same as for unitary operations if one of the two input bases is formed by the right eigenstates of @xmath0",
    ". an important property of any bound is its tightness . in particular , for quantum process fidelity bounds we would like to have both the upper and lower bounds equal to one if the actual and the desired quantum transformation coincide , because in that case the fidelity is @xmath96 .",
    "we demonstrated that our bound is tight if one set of probe states is formed by right eigenstates of @xmath0 and the other by their quantum fourier transform or by their hadamard transform .",
    "the proposed bounds extend the toolbox of efficient methods of characterization of quantum operations @xcite and provide a method for quick checking of quality of quantum filters before their more comprehensive characterization , e.g. by quantum process tomography .",
    "as an illustration , we have theoretically investigated application of the proposed fidelity bounds to characterization of a specific two - qubit linear - optical quantum filter .",
    "this filter is implemented by two - photon interference on a partially polarizing beam splitter followed by conditioning on emergence of a single photon at each output port of the beam splitter , and it is often utilized in optical quantum information processing with polarization encoded qubits .",
    "we consider experimentally convenient choice of product input probe states for which the required output state fidelities can be directly determined by product single - qubit measurements .",
    "it turns out that the price to pay for this experimental convenience is that the resulting bounds are generally not tight .",
    "we compare our analytical bounds with ultimate lower and upper bounds that can be obtained from a given experimental data with the help of convex optimization .",
    "the experimental data represent a set of linear constraints and we numerically solve a so - called semidefinite program that among all quantum operations satisfying given linear constraints finds an operation with minimum and maximum overlap with the target quantum filter @xmath0 .",
    "we observe that the ultimate lower and upper fidelity bounds obtained in this way are tight , i.e. equal to one for perfect filters , even if the analytical ones are not . in this way",

    "<S> we find that it is particularly suitable to construct one of the probe basis from the right eigenstates of @xmath0 , because in this case the bounds are tight in the sense that if the actual filter coincides with the ideal one then both the lower and upper bounds are equal to one . </S>",
    "<S> we theoretically investigate application of these bounds to a two - qubit optical quantum filter formed by interference of two photons on a partially polarizing beam splitter . for experimentally convenient choice of factorized input states and measurements </S>",
    "<S> we study the tightness of the bounds . </S>",
    "<S> we show that more stringent bounds can be obtained by more sophisticated processing of the data using convex optimization and we compare our methods for different choice of the input probe states . </S>"
