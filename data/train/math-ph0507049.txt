    "our goal is to find the ground state energy of a low density gas of fermions interacting with short range pair potentials .",
    "earlier @xcite , the corresponding problem for bosons had been solved in the sense that the ` well known ' ancient formula @xmath6 in 3d was proved rigorously as an asymptotic formula for small @xmath5 in the thermodynamic limit . here , @xmath7 , where @xmath0 is the particle number",
    ", @xmath8 is the volume and @xmath1 is the scattering length of the pair potential .",
    "owing to the recent interest in low density , cold gases of fermionic atoms , the natural question arose : is a similar formula valid for spin-@xmath9 fermions ?",
    "of course there will be differences , which we can list as follows :    1 .",
    "we can expect that the interaction energy between pairs of fermions of the same spin vanishes to leading order in @xmath5 .",
    "the pauli principle ( antisymmetry ) implies that the wave function is tiny within the range of the pair potential .",
    "2 .   the interaction between pairs of fermions of opposite spin should be the same as for bosons .",
    "i.e. , we expect this energy to be @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the numbers of spin up and spin down particles , respectively .",
    "a major difference from the bosonic case is that the energy we are trying to compute is only the second order term in the density .",
    "the first order term is just the kinetic energy of the ideal fermi gas , which is @xmath13 .",
    "4 .   finding an upper bound to the energy in the fermionic case is more difficult than in the bosonic case .",
    "there , one uses the fact that it is _ not _ necessary to look for trial states in the bosonic ( symmetric ) sector because the bosonic energy agrees with the absolute minimum energy and , consequently , any variational state without symmetry restriction gives an upper bound to the bosonic ground state energy .",
    "the same is obviously not true for fermions , which means that we must rigorously enforce antisymmetry of our trial state .",
    "the third item gives rise to two problems that did not have to be faced in the bosonic case .",
    "the first is that we will have to be careful not to ` give up ' any low momentum kinetic energy in order to control the interaction potential .",
    "that kinetic energy is part of the main term in the energy and , therefore , has to be left intact . since the interaction range @xmath1 is very small compared to the fermi momentum , which is proportional to @xmath14 , there is hope that in the low density regime this decomposition of the kinetic energy into low and high density parts can be cleanly achieved .",
    "_ this is one of the main technical accomplishments of our work . _    the second main problem is closely related to this kinetic energy consideration .",
    "it is that the typical particle momentum is of the order of the fermi momentum , which is not zero .",
    "therefore , one could question whether the ` zero energy scattering length ' contains all the necessary information about the interaction . that it does so is a consequence of the good separation of momentum scales mentioned above , but proving this fact mathematically requires some thought .    in the next section",
    "we explain the problem and our results in more detail .",
    "the complete details can be found in @xcite and the present note can be regarded as a guide to the overall structure of @xcite .",
    "our model describes fermions interacting through a short range pair potential  @xmath15 .",
    "the * hamiltonian * ( in units in which @xmath16 ) is @xmath17 the nonnegative pair - potential , @xmath18 , is radial ( i.e. , depends only on @xmath19 ) and has finite range ( i.e. , has compact support ) .",
    "a favorite physical example is a hard core , @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 otherwise .",
    "we generalize the physical problem a little by treating higher spins than @xmath9 , since we let the hamiltonian @xmath23 act on the fermionic hilbert space with @xmath24 spin states .",
    "spin @xmath9 corresponds to @xmath25 .",
    "the particles are restricted to a box @xmath26 ^ 3 $ ] of volume @xmath27 .",
    "the hilbert space describing @xmath0 fermions with @xmath24-spin states in this box is @xmath28 we use dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "since the hamiltonian does not depend on the spin degrees of freedom , we may think of the system as consisting of @xmath24 species of spinless fermions .",
    "we are interested in the ground state energy @xmath29 in the thermodynamic limit , more precisely the energy per unit volume defined by @xmath30 this limit is known to exist by very general arguments dating back to the 50 s .",
    "[ thm : fermi ] for @xmath31 the minimum energy is achieved ( to the two leading orders in @xmath32 ) by having equal numbers of particles ( namely @xmath33 ) in each spin state .",
    "this energy is @xmath34 where the first term is the energy of a free fermi gas and the second term depends on the pair potential through its scattering length @xmath35 .    the * scattering length * @xmath35 of the spherically symmetric potential @xmath15 is defined as the constant such that the spherically symmetric zero - energy scattering solution @xmath36 satisfies @xmath37 for all @xmath38 outside the range of @xmath15 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : fermi ] is given in @xcite .",
    "* remarks : * ( i ) the relevant dimensionless parameter is @xmath39 .",
    "low density means that @xmath40 or that @xmath31 , when @xmath35 is kept fixed .",
    "\\(ii ) for a hard core potential @xmath35 is simply the hard core size .",
    "\\(iii ) from the definition of the scattering length we see , by an integration by parts , that @xmath41 heuristically , we may interpret this result as saying that for just one pair of particles in a large volume the energy is @xmath42 per particle or altogether @xmath43 .",
    "the number of `` interacting '' fermion pairs is @xmath44 .",
    "the interaction of identical fermions can be ignored for low density , as explained earlier .",
    "the low density energy asymptotics for bosons ( or even without any symmetry restrictions , i.e. , if @xmath45 ) was proved by lieb and yngvason in @xcite .",
    "some subsequent developments are in @xcite@xcite . for an up - to - date survey of rigorous results on the bose gas @xcite is recommended .    for @xmath31 @xmath46    note that the correlation term is the leading term here .    in 1957",
    "dyson @xcite proved the asymptotically correct upper bound .",
    "this is far from trivial since one can not use a simple product trial function , which would give infinity in the hard core case .",
    "dyson also gave a lower bound for bosons , which however was not asymptotically exact .",
    "dyson s lower bound relied on the following lemma , which , in fact , was also a key ingredient in the rigorous lower bound in @xcite .",
    "assume @xmath15 supported in @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 be the characteristic function of @xmath49 .",
    "then for any positive radial function @xmath50 supported in @xmath51 with @xmath52 we have the operator inequality @xmath53 \\geq a_v \\int u   |\\phi|^2 .\\ ] ]    dyson s lemma states that one may , as a lower bound , replace @xmath15 by a much softer potential @xmath54 with the property that @xmath55 .",
    "however , one has to use _ all _ of the kinetic energy to do this .    in the rigorous argument in @xcite",
    "only _ almost all _ the kinetic energy is used with the dyson lemma . the rest is used to carry through a perturbation argument .    as explained in the introduction we can not afford to give up even a fraction of the low momentum part of the kinetic energy in the fermionic case , since it is responsible for the leading free fermi term .",
    "we therefore need a generalization of dyson s lemma , which we describe below .",
    "lenz @xcite was the first to calculate the energy  ( [ star ] ) , using the heuristic pair argument given in remark ( iii ) after theorem  [ thm : fermi ] .",
    "bogoliubov @xcite did a perturbative expansion , but got @xmath56 instead of @xmath35 .",
    "he realized , of course , that this was meaningless ( e.g. for the hard core ) .",
    "as bogoliubov points out in his paper , landau realized the connection to the scattering length .",
    "namely , that @xmath56 is the first term in the born series for @xmath35 .",
    "see also @xcite",
    ".    using bogoliubov s method , the next term in the expansion beyond @xmath57 has been calculated to be @xmath58 an important open problem is to prove this formula rigorously . as in the leading term , this correction depends on @xmath15 only through the scattering length .",
    "* for fermions the correlation energy is a lower order effect . *",
    "the scattering length is related to the lowest energy of a pair of particles .",
    "the fermions can however not all be in low energy states .",
    "they must _ almost _ fill the free fermi sea .",
    "why does the scattering length still give the right answer ?",
    "* for fermions we can not give up even a fraction of the kinetic energy , since it is responsible for the leading free fermi term .",
    "the `` solution '' to the above problems is that the contributions to the two terms in the expansion come from different momentum regimes .",
    "the free fermi energy comes from momenta @xmath59 the contribution to the second term comes from momenta of order @xmath60 .",
    "recall @xmath61 .    * in finding a bosonic upper bound",
    "it is _ not _ necessary to look for trial states in the bosonic symmetry sector .",
    "the bosonic energy agrees with the absolute minimum . for fermions we must enforce antisymmetry of our trial state .",
    "the solution to the problem that we can not give up any fraction of the low momentum kinetic energy is to give up almost all the energy in the large momentum regime only .",
    "large here means momenta much greater than the fermi momentum .",
    "if we give up kinetic energy corresponding to momenta greater than the fermi momentum only , and in such a way that as a function of momentum the kinetic energy is still monotone , we do not affect the leading free fermi gas term .",
    "the following lemma , which allows us to do this , is the main technical advance in our work .",
    "assume @xmath15 to be supported in @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 be the characteristic function of @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath62 be a radial function , @xmath63 , such that the fourier transform @xmath64 is bounded and integrable .",
    "define @xmath65 then for any @xmath66 and any positive radial function @xmath50 supported in @xmath51 with @xmath52 we have the operator inequality @xmath67    @xmath68 is a parameter we shall choose such that @xmath69 .",
    "we will choose the function @xmath62 to be approximately the characteristic function for the set of momenta greater than the fermi momentum , which is proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "this corresponds to decomposing the kinetic energy into low and high momentum parts as shown in the figures below .",
    "to explain how the generalized dyson lemma is used to get a lower bound to the energy we consider , for simplicity , the case @xmath25 and write @xmath70 , @xmath71 for the coordinates of the two species of fermions .",
    "without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath72 .",
    "the reason is that the system is @xmath73 symmetric and every state of total spin @xmath74 can be rotated to a state of total @xmath75 .",
    "nevertheless we will keep the particle numbers arbitrary for the moment for pedagogical clarity .",
    "we first consider the @xmath76 particles as fixed . for a lower bound we may ignore the repulsion between like fermions since @xmath18 . from the generalized dyson lemma we obtain the following result .",
    "+ let @xmath77 be bigger than the range of the potential @xmath78 .",
    "if @xmath79 for all @xmath80 , then @xmath81    to use this we must ignore @xmath82-particles that are closer than @xmath83 apart .",
    "this can be controlled by the following a - priori bound .",
    "let @xmath84 be the number of @xmath82 s that are less than @xmath85 from their nearest neighbor . then for any fermionic wave function @xmath86 @xmath87 and @xmath88 is a constant .",
    "this lemma is an easy consequence of a theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5 ) relating nearest neighbor distance to kinetic energy .    for an approximate ground state",
    "@xmath89 we can assume @xmath90 .",
    "recall that we will choose @xmath91 , and thus @xmath92 .",
    "the soft potential can now be studied with the remaining low momentum kinetic energy .",
    "@xmath93,\\ ] ] where @xmath94 refers to the sum over the @xmath95 @xmath82-particles that are a distance greater than @xmath83 from their nearest neighbor .",
    "since we can ignore @xmath84 the sum of the @xmath11 lowest eigenvalues of the operator in @xmath96 $ ] is approximately @xmath97 we get a similar contribution when we consider the @xmath76 particles as movable and the @xmath98 particles as fixed .",
    "if we also use that @xmath52 the sum of the two contributions will be @xmath99 here we see again that the minimum occurs for @xmath72 , and is given by ( [ eq : main ] ) .",
    "for an upper bound we first construct a bijl - dingle - jastrow function for particles of the same spin : @xmath100 where @xmath101 if @xmath102 , @xmath103 if @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "the role of @xmath106 is to ensure that like fermions do not interact .",
    "next , we construct a bijl - dingle - jastrow function for particles of opposite spin : @xmath107 where @xmath108 ( which is not normalized , since it , like @xmath109 , satisfies @xmath110 as @xmath111 ) is chosen so that @xmath112 ( compare with ( [ square ] ) . ) the role of @xmath113 is to give the correct pair energy between different fermions .    finally , the trial state we shall use is @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a slater determinant of eigenfunctions @xmath116 of the dirichlet laplacian .",
    "the choice of this @xmath89 is quite obvious .",
    "the problem is that it is _ not normalized_. the normalization problem can be addressed with the aid of the following combinatorial lemma , for which we claim no originality .      *",
    "the norm of @xmath123 is given by @xmath124 .",
    "* for @xmath125 , the @xmath126-particle density of @xmath123 is given by @xmath127\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge [ \\phi(x_m ) ] \\left| \\frac      1{{\\mathcal m}}\\otimes \\cdots \\otimes \\frac 1{{\\mathcal m}}\\right| [ \\phi(x)]\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge [ \\phi(x_m ) ] \\right \\rangle\\,.\\ ] ]      we use this lemma , for fixed @xmath76 , with @xmath129 .",
    "the matrix @xmath120 in ( [ mmatrix ] ) then depends on @xmath76 and is denoted by @xmath130 .",
    "the following estimate shows that although the @xmath131 are not orthonormal , @xmath130 is close to @xmath132 if the separation between the @xmath76-particles is not too small .      note that if @xmath108 were identically @xmath137 , then @xmath120 would be equal to the identity .",
    "the proof of lemma  [ keylemma ] uses the poincar inequality to estimate the effect of the deviation of @xmath108 from @xmath137 on the integral in ( [ mmatrix ] ) .",
    "the assumption that @xmath133 in lemma  [ keylemma ] is satisfied since our trial function vanishes otherwise , thanks to the property of @xmath106 .",
    "lemma  [ keylemma ] is concerned only with the effect of @xmath113 on the norm of @xmath89 .",
    "the effect of @xmath106 on the norm of @xmath89 has to be controlled by different means . for this purpose",
    "we find it necessary to break space up into boxes ( whose size is large but independent of @xmath138 ) and confine the particles to these boxes , i.e. , regard particles in different boxes as independent .",
