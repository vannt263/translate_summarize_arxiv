    "mean field theory is a widely used method in statistical physics and quantum field theory , in particular for ground states characterized by condensates and spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "for example , mean field solutions of the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite or extensions of it are one of the main theoretical tools in nuclear physics .",
    "the recent discussion of color superconductivity at high but realistic baryon density is mainly based on this method @xcite .",
    "one out of many examples from statistical physics is a mean field description @xcite of antiferromagnetic and superconducting condensates in the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "quite generally , mean field theory ( mft ) seems to be well suited for systems with multifermion interactions and bosonic condensates .",
    "it is well known that mft has a basic ambiguity which is connected with the possibility to perform fierz transformations ( ft ) for the underlying local multifermion interaction .",
    "for example , in the hubbard model this ambiguity has a sizable influence on the results @xcite .",
    "the origin of this ambiguity becomes apparent already in the simplest njl - type model ( for only one fermion species ) with a chirally invariant pointlike four fermion interaction : @xmath1 \\\\\\nonumber & -&\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_{v}[(\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^{\\mu}\\psi)^2 ] -\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_{a}[(\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^{\\mu}\\gamma^{5}\\psi)^{2}]\\bigg\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this paper we concentrate on this model which is regularized by a sharp momentum cutoff @xmath2 .    due to the fierz identity @xmath3 + 2\\left[(\\bar{\\psi}\\psi)^{2}-(\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^{5}\\psi)^{2}\\right ] = 0\\ ] ] only two of the quartic couplings are independent and we write @xmath4 the parameter @xmath5 is redundant since it multiplies just the vanishing expression .",
    "no physical quantity can depend on @xmath5 in a full computation of the functional integral for the partition function and expectation values of field operators .",
    "the model is completely characterized by the two  physical  couplings @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we will see in sect .",
    "[ sec::mean ] that the mft results can strongly depend on @xmath5 , limiting their quantitative reliability .",
    "for example , the value of the critical coupling @xmath8 for the onset of a nonvanishing condensate @xmath9 depends on @xmath5 for fixed @xmath10 values in the first row of tabs .",
    "[ tab::crit ] , [ tab::crit2 ] ) .",

    "similarly , for given @xmath7 , @xmath6 the mean field value of the condensate @xmath13 in the phase with spontaneous symmetry breaking depends on @xmath5 .",
    "the origin of the mean field ambiguity is easy to understand : once the pointlike interaction has been  distributed  on the channels @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( with respective couplings @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) the interactions in the channels @xmath15 and @xmath16 do not influence .",
    "we note that the mf - ambiguity gets enhanced once we include , in addition , di - fermion channels @xmath20 and @xmath21 . ]",
    "the computation in the channel @xmath14 anymore  at least as long as the mean fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 do not yet get an expectation value .",
    "this distribution depends , however , on the parameter @xmath5 . it may sometimes be possible to develop from other considerations an educated guess what should be the distribution of the interaction on the various channels , thus limiting the range of  acceptable  @xmath5",
    "still , the spread of the results over the acceptable range of @xmath5 should be considered as a lower bound for the systematic uncertainty of a mft computation .",
    "depending on the other uncertainties the relative importance of this  fierz - ambiguity  may be more or less important .",
    "for the example of tab .",
    "[ tab::crit ] the fierz ambiguity of mft seems to be of the same size as the spread in the results between the different methods beyond mft . on the other hand , for the values used in tab .",
    "[ tab::crit2 ] the ambiguity for the range @xmath24 is so large that no quantitative statement is possible for mft unless @xmath5 can be restricted to a much smaller range .    a correct ",
    "guess  of @xmath5 is often difficult only depends on the total momentum of the bilinear @xmath25 and similar for the other channels . ] .",
    "one may therefore prefer to reduce the dependence on the unphysical parameter @xmath5 by computing in a more elaborate approximation .",
    "this situation is very similar to perturbative computations in quantum field theory : the results in a given order depend on the renormalization scheme and the renormalization scale @xmath26 .",
    "typically , the scheme dependence ( @xmath26-dependence ) gets reduced in higher orders .",
    "since the physical results can not depend on @xmath26 the residual @xmath26-dependence is often used as a guess for the remaining error  in fact it constitutes a lower bound for the systematic uncertainty in a given order of the perturbative expansion .    in this paper",
    "we want to investigate methods where mft appears as some type of first step in a more systematic expansion .",
    "we find indeed that for these methods the dependence on @xmath5 is reduced as compared to mft .",
    "for some approximations a residual @xmath5-dependence remains which should again be considered as a lower bound on the systematic uncertainties at this level .",
    "we will discuss methods based on the exact renormalization group equation for the effective average action @xcite or on schwinger - dyson equations @xcite . to improve the approximation we include additional diagrams similar to those needed at order @xmath27 in the @xmath27-expansion @xcite .    as a guidance , we first study in sect .",
    "[ sec::perturbation ] perturbation theory in the one - loop approximation . while the results are independent of @xmath5 , the validity of the perturbative calculation is limited to small coupling .",
    "in particular , the interesting phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) can not be seen .",
    "this shortcoming is improved substantially by the use of a non - perturbative flow equation for the scale - dependence of the effective average action @xmath28 @xcite . in this approach an infrared cutoff with scale @xmath29",
    "is introduced such that only fluctuations with momenta @xmath30 contribute effectively .",
    "the effective couplings therefore depend on the scale and their is governed by a renormalization group ( rg ) equation .",
    "for example , in a simple truncation @xmath28 takes the same form as the action , but the couplings become now scale dependent , i.e. @xmath31 etc .. in the limit @xmath32 the infrared cutoff is absent and all fluctuations are included . for @xmath32 the effective average action @xmath33 is the generating functional of the 1pi - greens functions of the full theory .",
    "the scale dependence of @xmath28 is described by an exact functional differential non - perturbative approximations to this exact equation involve a truncation of the general form of @xmath28 .",
    "the non - perturbative flow equations for the quartic couplings @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are solved in sect . [ sec::fermion ] . now",
    "the onset of ssb is signaled by a divergence of the quartic couplings @xmath37 .",
    "the fermionic flow equation yields results for the critical couplings which are independent of @xmath5 .",
    "unfortunately , in contrast to mft , one can not easily extend the investigation to the phase with ssb and compute , for example , the value of the order parameter or the fermion mass gap .",
    "this would require the inclusion of multifermion interactions in the flow ( e.g. eight fermion interactions ) , leading to high algebraic complexity .",
    "partial bosonization seems to be the ideal remedy to this difficulty @xcite . in the model",
    "is rewritten as an equivalent yukawa type model with scalars @xmath38 , vectors @xmath39 and axial vectors @xmath40 representing the corresponding fermion bilinears .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking can now be dealt with by computing the effective potential for @xmath38 and looking for a minimum at @xmath41 .",
    "for example , a term @xmath42 stands for an eight fermion interaction .",
    "unfortunately , partial bosonization brings back the  fierz ambiguity  of mft .",

    "[ tab::crit ] , [ tab::crit2 ] ) .",
    "the reason for the incompleteness at the one - loop level is the omission of quartic fermion couplings which are generated by the flow for @xmath46 . in @xcite",
