    "the dark halo of our galaxy may consist of wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) .",
    "direct detection experiments attempt to observe the nuclear recoil caused by these dark matter particles interacting with the nuclei of the detector .",
    "currently many such detectors are in operation worldwide , including cdms , cosme , cresst , dama , drift , edelweiss , elegant v , hdms , igex , lif / tokyo , losalamos , mibeta , rosebud , saclay , ukdmc , and zeplin",
    ". these detectors may be able to observe not only the general halo component but also streams of dark matter moving through our solar system .",
    "recently , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) surveys @xcite have traced the tidal stream of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( sgr ) more than @xmath2 around the sky .",
    "it is believed that this tidal stream is currently moving through the solar neighborhood , and that it contains dark matter in addition to stars . in this paper",
    "we investigate the possibility of detecting wimp dark matter in this stream via direct detection experiments .    the sagittarius galaxy , a dwarf spheroidal galaxy of roughly @xmath3 , is a satellite of our own much larger milky way galaxy , located inside the milky way , @xmath415 kpc behind the galactic center and @xmath46 kpc below the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "there are two streams of matter that extend outwards from the main body of the sgr galaxy .",
    "these streams , known as the leading and trailing tidal tails , are made of matter tidally pulled away from the sgr galaxy .",
    "the leading tail may be showering matter down upon the solar system @xcite .",
    "the flow is in the general direction orthogonal to the galactic plane and has a speed of roughly 300 km / s ( see discussion in  2 below ) .",
    "this speed is comparable to that of the relative speed of the sun and the wimps in the general dark halo .",
    "hence one can hope to detect the stream in direct detection experiments .",
    "the detectability depends on the density of dark matter in the stream .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio @xmath5 in the stream is unknown , but is plausibly at least as large as that in the sgr main body ; in fact , the @xmath5 in the stream may be significantly larger because the dark matter on the outskirts of the main body would be tidally stripped before the ( more centrally located ) stars .",
    "various determinations of the @xmath5 for the sgr main body give values in the range 25 to 100 ( see the discussion in @xcite and references therein ) . with our assumptions , we find a density of dark matter in the stream in the range 0.3 to 23% of the local dark halo density .",
    "if the dwarf does not contain dark matter or the stream does not pass through the solar neighborhood , then the contribution to the local dark matter density is zero .",
    "this additional flux of wimps from the stream shows up as a 0.323% increase in the rate of nuclear recoils at energies below a characteristic energy @xmath6 , the highest energy that wimps in the stream can impart to a target nucleus .",
    "hence , there is a step in the energy recoil spectrum ; the count rate in the detector is enhanced at low energies , but then returns to the normal value ( due to galactic halo wimps ) at all energies above the critical energy @xmath6 .",
    "this feature can be observed as a sharp decrease in the count rate above a characteristic energy that depends on the mass of the target nucleus , the mass of the wimp , and the speed of the stream relative to the detector .",
    "it is well known that the count rate in wimp detectors will experience an annual modulation @xcite as a result of the motion of the earth around the sun : the relative velocity of the detector with respect to the wimps depends on the time of year .",
    "we find that the count rate of wimps in the stream is a maximum on june 28 and a minimum on december 27 .",
    ", there is a small range of energy recoils in which the count signal has the same phase as the characteristic energy and so peaks in december . ]",
    "note that this modulation has a different phase than does the ordinary annual modulation of wimps in the galactic halo , which peaks on june 2 for high energy recoils ( and december 20 for low energy thresholds @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , we find that the value of the characteristic energy @xmath6 of the step in the energy recoil spectrum oscillates in time with a period of a year .",
    "the step location experiences an annual modulation exactly 180@xmath7 out of phase with that of the stream count rate . to give a number , for a 60 gev wimp detected in a ge-73 detector",
    ", the characteristic energy for the sgr stream varies between 25 and 35 kev .",
    "as we will show , this step feature in the energy recoil spectrum should be detectable at the three @xmath1 level in the cdms experiment using two kilograms of @xmath8ge and taking four years of data with 10 kev energy bins .    in 1994 and again in 2001 , the heat collaboration @xcite detected an excess of cosmic ray positrons .",
    "baltz et al .",
    "@xcite explored the possibility that this excess is due to the annihilation of neutralino dark matter in the galactic halo .",
    "they found that neutralino annihilation can produce enough positrons to make up the measured excess in the minimal supersymmetric standard model provided there is an additional enhancement to the signal due to dark matter clumps in the galactic halo .",
    "baltz et al",
    ".  found that , under current constraints on the mssm , the `` boost factor '' needs to be at least 30 in the signal .",
    "the sagittarius stream provides at most a 23% enhancement of the signal , and hence is unlikely to provide an explanation of the boost factor required for neutralino annihilation to explain the heat data . however , the uncertainties in the propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy are large and it may be possible that a smaller boost factor may suffice , so further studies are warranted .",
    "detection of this dark matter stream would be important also for our understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "the traditional assumption that the halo population of stars is old and well mixed has been seriously challenged by recent observations that the outer parts of the stellar halo contain tidal debris that is merging with the milky way even at the current epoch .",
    "recent n - body simulations of galaxy formation suggest that there may be dwarf satellites of the milky way that contain only dark matter and no stars .",
    "if dark matter can be detected in the sagittarius stream , then we could use dark matter detectors on earth to look for remnants of these dark companions of our milky way .",
    "the factors that affect dark matter direct detection experiments are the local dark matter density and velocity vector of material in the leading tail of the sgr dwarf galaxy that passes through the solar neighborhood .",
    "below , we estimate that the ( local ) sgr leading tail is moving with a velocity of 300@xmath990 km / s in the direction @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the north galactic pole , and @xmath12 is in the direction of the local disk stars motion ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "equivalently , the local motion of the sgr leading tail points in the direction @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the galactic longitude and @xmath16 is the galactic latitude .",
    "all velocities are measured with respect to the rest frame of the center of mass of the milky way galaxy .",
    "we will also find an estimated range for the local density of dark matter of : @xmath17 \\times 10 ^ 4   m_\\odot/{\\rm kpc}^3 = [ 0.001 , 0.07 ] \\ , { \\rm gev / cm^3 } , \\ ] ] which corresponds to ( 0.3 - 23)% of the local density of the isothermal galactic halo .",
    "the density calculation is highly uncertain , since ( 1 ) the stellar density is not well measured anywhere along the stream and has not been directly detected in the solar neighborhood , and ( 2 ) @xmath5 is highly uncertain in the sagittarius dwarf itself and is unmeasured in the tidal stream .",
    "models of the tidal disruption have not been developed or constrained by observations to the point that they usefully predict the local properties of coherent dark matter in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we will derive our estimates from empirical observations of the old populations of stars in the tidal stream .",
    "blue horizontal branch stars and main sequence turnoff stars are old enough that their populations are not likely to have significantly changed in the time since these stars were stripped from the dwarf galaxy .",
    "the important measurable quantities are ( 1 ) the number of stars observed in some portion of the tidal stream , ( 2 ) the volume of that portion of the tidal stream , ( 3 ) the relationship between number of observed stars of a particular type and total luminosity in stars , and ( 4 ) @xmath5 in the tidal stream .      the sgr dwarf galaxy is currently about 16 kpc from the galactic center , near its closest approach to the galactic center ( perigalacticon ) . as seen from the sun , sgr has a radial velocity of @xmath18 km / s and a tangential velocity of @xmath19 km / s @xcite .",
    "correcting for the solar motion as given in  3.2 , we derive a current velocity of @xmath20 km / s for the dwarf , in the reference frame of the galaxy center .",
    "stars in the leading tidal tail , which extends to near the solar position , were stripped from the side of the dwarf that is closer to the center of the milky way . at the time that the stars are stripped from the gravitational pull of the dwarf galaxy and released into the potential of the milky way",
    ", they have about the same orbital velocity as the dwarf galaxy itself ( we assume that the dwarf galaxy stars have no bulk rotation ) . due to their closer proximity to the galactic center",
    ", they have a lower gravitational potential energy , and therefore shorter orbital periods - thus creating the leading tail .",
    "stars in the trailing tail were stripped at larger distances from the center of the milky way .",
    "the higher orbital energy of these stars produces larger distances from the galactic center and longer orbital periods .",
    "the trailing tidal tail has been traced in two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) m giant stars through nearly @xmath21 of sky south of the galactic plane , to a maximum distance of @xmath450 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "the tidal tails lie on a plane that passes through the galactic center .",
    "the sun lies within a kiloparsec of that plane , and near the path of the leading sgr debris @xcite .",
    "the stars in the tidal tails must conserve both energy and angular momentum , in the absence of dynamical friction .",
    "since the stars in the trailing tail of sgr have an apogalacticon of 90 kpc or more , while the stars in the leading tail have an apogalacticon of only about 45 kpc @xcite , the trailing tail stars must have significantly higher energies than the stars in the leading tail .",
    "if most of the stars are stripped near the perigalacticon of the sagittarius dwarf , at 16 kpc from the center of the milky way , then the leading and trailing debris must have been stripped from parts of the sagittarius dwarf that differ in galactocentric distance by at least 10 kpc @xcite .",
    "it is sensible , therefore , that the perigalacticon of the stars in the leading tail could be 11 kpc or less .",
    "since the mass of the milky way is distributed throughout its volume and is not concentrated at the center , stars do not travel in closed orbits , but rather in rosette patterns .",
    "the angle between successive perigalacticon passages is less than 360@xmath7 .",
    "the sun is near the first expected perigalacticon passage of the leading tail , at about the right distance .",
    "since the tidal stream is approximately 6 kpc across , it is reasonable to suspect that the tidal steam passes through the solar position .",
    "majewski et al .",
    "@xcite show that stellar debris appears to be raining down on the solar position from approximately the direction of the north galactic pole .    without significant dissipative forces",
    ", the average speed of the tidal debris in the solar neighborhood ( which is at perigalacticon ) should be the same as the current speed of the sgr dwarf ( which is also at perigalacticon ) .",
    "the debris should travel approximately in the plane of the sgr dwarf tidal debris . if the debris is near perigalacticon , then its motion is approximately perpendicular to the line from the sun to the galactic center . from these three conditions ,",
    "we derive that the debris velocity is in the direction @xmath22 , where @xmath11 is the north galactic pole , and @xmath12 is in the direction of the local disk stars motion ( @xmath13 ) . in terms of galactic latitude @xmath16 and galactic longitude @xmath15 , this direction is equivalent to the direction @xmath14 .",
    "in this section we use simple parameters of the sgr dwarf tidal system to roughly estimate the sgr dwarf contribution to the local dark matter density . in the next section",
    "we will make more careful estimates of the parameters",
    ".    published estimates of the original total mass of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy are in the range @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "the lower number is within a factor of two of current estimates of the mass of the sgr dwarf , and the larger number is derived from the need to keep the dwarf intact for a hubble time @xcite .",
    "the width of the tidal stream in 2mass m stars is estimated to be 4 - 8 kpc @xcite .",
    "below , we will calculate a fwhm of 6 kpc from the data from the sdss @xcite .",
    "this width is of the order of the size of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "estimates of the _ current _ mass of the sgr dwarf galaxy are in the range @xmath25 \\times 10 ^ 8 m_\\odot , \\ ] ] possibly several orders of magnitude lower than the original mass of the sgr dwarf at its time of formation .",
    "the lower mass is the mass within the sgr dwarf tidal radius calculated by majewski et al .",
    "@xcite from the dispersion of the radial velocities of sgr dwarf stars .",
    "comparing their mass to the luminosity of the sgr , they derive a mass - to - light ratio @xmath5 of 25 - 29 in solar units .",
    "other authors have argued for @xmath5 as high as 100 @xcite ( four times as high ) based on the need to keep the sgr dwarf intact for a hubble time .",
    "this produces the upper end of the current mass range .",
    "given that the @xmath5 ratio is expected to be 25 or higher , calculations of the mass density in the sgr dwarf and tidal tails are essentially equal to the dark matter density .",
    "a typical disruption model @xcite assumes the current mass of the sgr dwarf is about @xmath3 , and that the dwarf lost about 2 - 3 times that mass in the last gigayear ( somewhat longer than an orbit ) .",
    "if this is spread out into a tidal stream 6 kpc in diameter and 250 kpc in length ( this is the length of the observed tidal stream in stars ) , then an estimate of the local dark matter density is : @xmath26 this is one percent of the estimated local dark matter density .",
    "we now explore the range of dark matter local dark matter densities that are consistent with our knowledge of the sagittarius system , assuming that the leading tidal tail passes through the solar neighborhood .    in order to calculate the local dark matter density from data",
    ", we would like to measure the local mass density of stars from the stream , and multiply by @xmath5 calculated for our position on the leading tidal tail . neither the local density of sgr stream stars , nor the local mass - to - light ratio in the stream , is known .",
    "instead , we can calculate the density of f / g turnoff stars at one location along the trailing tidal tail , tabulate the blue horizontal branch star density at several positions along the leading and trailing tidal streams , and estimate @xmath5 from the sgr dwarf itself . using these quantities , we estimate the dark matter density from the sgr tidal stream in the solar neighborhood .",
    "specifically , we wish to estimate @xmath27 , the dark matter density of the tail in the neighborhood of the sun , as the product of three quantities : @xmath28 ideally , one would like to measure all of these quantities in the tidal stream at the solar position .",
    "because none of these quantities are known at the solar position , each term will be estimated from other measurable portions of the sgr tidal stream .    to estimate the first term on the right hand side",
    ", we will measure",
    "the density of f / g turnoff stars in a portion of the trailing tidal tail 50 kpc from the sgr dwarf ( stripe 82 in the sdss ) .",
    "the density in this location is the best measured anywhere in the tidal tails . to obtain an estimate of the density at our location ,",
    "we extrapolate from measurements of blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars at three places along the tidal tails .",
    "we discover that the density of the stars in a piece of the leading tail 50 kpc from the sgr dwarf ( stripe 10 in the sdss ) is nearly a factor of two higher , giving us a larger range of possible dark matter densities at the solar position : @xmath29 . the second term on the right hand side of eq.([eq : product ] )",
    "is then @xmath30 .",
    "the third term is @xmath31 .",

    "first , we measure the stellar density of f / g turnoff stars in stripe 82 , @xmath35 , about 50 kpc from the sgr dwarf along the trailing tidal tail .",
    "figure 22 of newberg et al .",
    "@xcite shows the counts of f / g turnoff stars along the celestial equator . from that figure , one can estimate that in the sgr stream overdensity labeled s167 - 54 - 21.5 ( in red ) , there are 1000 stars per half - degree - wide bin at the peak .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the background star counts in that region of the sky , but it is between zero and 400 stars per half degree bin . the total width of the ( approximately triangular ) profile is 50 degrees , or 100 bins .",
    "thus , we estimate the total number of f / g sgr stream stars in this 2.5 degree - wide stripe is between 30,000 and 50,000 .    in order to calculate the stream density at this position , we need to know the volume represented by the piece of the stream we have sampled .",
    "the fwhm of the stream is about @xmath36 in the observed stripe of sky . at a distance of 29 kpc from the sun",
    ", this would imply a stream width of 13 kpc .",
    "[ note , however , that the celestial equator does not cut through the sagittarius stream perpendicular to its path across the sky .",

    "we estimate that the angle between the actual tidal stream and the projection of the tidal stream perpendicular to our line of sight is about @xmath39 at this position in the sky @xcite , so the distance along the stream in the plane of the celestial equator is @xmath40 kpc . in the @xmath41 wide stripe we sample 1.3 kpc perpendicular to the celestial equator .",

    "this is not well known , but we will estimate it from bhb star counts @xcite .",
    "it would be better if we could measure the number of f / g turnoff stars , as they a more stable indicator of stellar density .",
    "however , the only piece of the stream close enough to the sun that this quantity has been measured reliably is the stripe 82 data discussed above .",

    "stripes 29 and 82 cross the trailing tidal stream , and stripe 10 crosses the leading tidal tail . stripes 29 and 10 are near perigalacticon for the trailing and leading tidal tails , respectively .",
    "the last column gives the adjusted relative a star density for each piece .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     the annual modulation of the characteristic energy @xmath6 can in principle be used to identify the signal due to wimps in the sgr stream . in particular , the annual modulation is a useful tool to differentiate between an increase in the count rate due to wimps in the sgr stream at energies below @xmath6 , and an increase due to modifications of the velocity distribution of galactic halo wimps .",
    "these possibilities are difficult to distinguish by simply examining the shape of the recoil spectrum because of the finite energy resolution and the binning of data in recoil energy in a real experiment .",
    "for this tool to be effective , the energy resolution must of course be better than the difference between the maximum and minimum values of @xmath6 . as discussed in section 3.4 above",
    ", this difference corresponds to an energy resolution of 2 - 18% depending on the exact velocity of the sgr stream . for our reference case of @xmath45 km / sec in the direction @xmath14 ,",
    "the value of @xmath6 is modulated by 9% over the course of the year .",
    "as long as the uncertainty in energy due to the energy resolution is smaller than the energy shift in @xmath6 , one should be able to detect its annual modulation .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath6 are indeed in the range accessible to current and upcoming dark matter experiments .",
    "for example , the nai detector of the dama experiment @xcite has an energy threshold of 2 kev electron equivalent , which corresponds to 22 kev recoil energy for iodine ; since iodine is much heavier than sodium , wimp interactions with iodine dominate the count rate , and the conversion factor between kevee and kev is a factor of 11 for iodine .",
    "hence for wimp masses heavier than 50 gev , the step lies above the dama threshold energy , and dama can in principle detect it .",

    ", the annual modulation of the value of @xmath6 for this reference case is a 9.2% effect , and peaks at a different date than the standard annual modulation in the galactic halo ( which causes the count rate to peak on june 2 ) .",

    "figure 4 shows a section of figure 3 ( as defined in the captions ) and illustrates that the sgr stream clearly stands out above the galactic halo wimps .",
    "we can estimate the exposure needed to identify the sgr stream by considering binning directional data into cells in directional energy space of size 10 kev .",
    "the count rate per bin is approximately given by the rate in figures 3 and 4 multiplied by the volume of the cell ( @xmath60 kev@xmath61 ) .",

    "therefore drift has the capability of identifying wimps in the sgr stream .",
    "recent observations of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr ) indicate the existence of tidal streams of stars that pass through the solar neighborhood . if the mass - to - light ratio in the streams is at least comparable to that of the main body of the sgr galaxy , then one can detect the existence of dark matter in the streams . under the assumption that the stream passes through the solar position",
    ", the dark matter stream plausibly has a density @xmath0(0.3 - 23)% of the local density of our galactic halo .",
    "if dark matter consists of wimps , the extra contribution from the stream gives rise to a step - like feature in the energy recoil spectrum in direct dark matter detection , i.e. , an increase in the rate in detectors at energy recoils less than some critical value @xmath6 that depends on the target nucleus and on the time of year .",
    "the location of the step experiences an annual modulation that will be useful in identifying the existence of the stream . the count rate in the detector is also modulated annually , with a maximum on june 28 and minimum on december 27 except near the characteristic energy where the phase is opposite .",
    "in the cdms experiment , for our best estimate of stream velocity ( 300 km / sec ) and direction [ @xmath14 ] , the location of the step oscillates yearly between 25 and 35 kev , with a phase opposite to that of the count rate . with two kg of germanium",
    ", the stream should be detectable at three @xmath1 s in four years of data with 10 kev energy bins . planned large detectors like xenon , cryoarray and the directional detector drift may be able to identify the sgr stream .",
