    ".    as shown by the previous example , even with high enough order for the expansion so the influence of the remainder is insignificant , the interval evaluation of the taylor series computes very crude bounds on the exponential of an interval matrix .",
    "the reason of this bad behavior of the taylor series interval evaluation is the dependency loss between the different occurrences of variable that occurs during the interval evaluation of an expression ( cf .",
