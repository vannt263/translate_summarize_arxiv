    "explosive death of a star , supernova , is a dramatic cosmic event that occurs at the end of the evolutionary path of many stars .",
    "observational study of such events can tell us whether our theoretical understanding of stellar evolution is correct , and thus studies of supernovae have been actively pursued ever since modern astronomy has begun .    among various kinds of supernovae , sne ia",
    "are believed to be the thermonuclear explosion of carbon - oxygen ( c / o ) white dwarfs in close binary systems ( see maoz et al .",
    "2014 for a recent review on this subject ) .",
    "this scenario is supported by the energetics and the chemical composition of the ejecta , as well as the progenitor ages inferred from their host galaxy properties ( holye & fowler 1960 ; also see hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 ) .",
    "yet we have no direct observational evidence that can constrain their progenitor systems , such as the size of the exploding star and the nature of its companion .",
    "two progenitor systems are theorized .",
    "one is the single degenerate ( sd ) system where the companion star is a non - degenerate star with a radius of 0.1  100 @xmath9 depending on its mass and evolutionary stage .",
    "the other is the double degenerate ( dd ) system where two white dwarfs merge to produce a sn ia in a close binary system as a result of orbital angular momentum loss via gravitational wave radiation . in both cases , the size of the exploding white dwarf",
    "is expected to be small ( @xmath10 ) . however , in the sd system , if the white dwarf was a recurrent nova that acrretes hydrogen - rich material with a fairly high mass accretion rate ( @xmath11/yr ) , the radius of the envelope could be as large as 0.2 @xmath12 ( e.g. , hachisu & kato 2003 ) . in the dd scenario ,",
    "the radius of the shock breakout surface would be about 0.1 @xmath12 if a prompt detonation occurred as a result of the merger ( pakmor et al .",
    "2012 ; tanikawa et al .",
    "2015 ) , while in the case of a long - delayed ( @xmath13 yr ) explosion after the merger , the radius would be only about @xmath14 ( yoon et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the very early light curve within @xmath15 day of the explosion can constrain properties of the progenitor system such as the radius of the detonating star and the companion star ( nakar & sari 2010 ; piro et al .",
    "2010 ; kasen 2010 , hereafter , k10 ; rabinak & waxman 2011 , hereafter rw11 ; maeda et al .",
    "2014 ; kutsuna & shigeyama 2015 ) .",
    "this is because the luminosity from the shock - heated materials that immediately follows the shock breakout is proportional to the radius of the progenitor star for a given set of progenitor mass and the supernova explosion energy ( k10 ; piro et al .",
    "2010 ; rw11 ; rabinak et al . 2012 ; piro & nakar 2013 , 2014 ; pan et al .",
    "this phase has been shown to last for several hours or more , with the exact duration depending on the progenitor size ( rabinak et al .",
    "2012 ; piro & nakar 2013 ) .",
    "the emission is generally dim with @xmath16 ",
    "@xmath17 mag for a progenitor radius of @xmath18 ",
    "@xmath19 ( figure 3 ) , but it could be much brighter if a much larger star is involved ( @xmath20 mag for @xmath21 ; k10 ) .",

    "in general , studies involving early light curves of normal sne ia suggest small progenitor sizes . using sn 2011fe , nugent et al .",
    "( 2011 ) constrained the progenitor radius , @xmath1 , to be @xmath22 , while bloom et al .",
    "( 2012 ) suggested an even tighter constraint of @xmath23 based on a non - detection at 7.5 hours before the estimated first light time .",
    "similar attempts have been made using other sne ia with early light curves , giving the limits of @xmath24 ",

    "2015 ) suggest that a progenitor system with a scale of @xmath29 for sn 2014j . for iptf14atg , cao et al .",
    "( 2015 ) find an early uv light that is consistent with a system that has a large companion star ( several tens of @xmath12 ) .",
    "however , the sn studied in cao et al .",
    "( 2015 ) is an underluminous sn ia , a peculiar one .",
    "we also note a possible detection of a single progenitor system for sn 2012z , another underluminous sn ia ( type iax ) , in a pre - explosion image ( mccully et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "these results assumed that the explosion time of sne ia coincides with the first light time of the light curve that is dominated by the heating due to radioactive decay of @xmath30ni .",
    "however , the rise of the radioactively powered light curve is expected to start a few hours to a few days after the explosion depending on how deep the @xmath30ni layer is ( piro & nakar 2013 ) , while the uv / optical emission from shock - heated materials occurs almost immediately after the explosion ( e.g. , hflich & schaefer 2009 ) .",
    "hence , the previous constraints on sne ia progenitors have been put into question .",
    "this time gap between the thermonuclear explosion and the rise of the radioactively powered light curve has been called as  dark phase \" or  delay time \" which we note as @xmath31 for convenience .",
    "the analysis of the early spectra of sn 2011fe by mazzali et al .",
    "( 2014 ) led them to conclude that the actual explosion of sn 2011fe preceded about 1 day before the first light time estimated by nugent et al .",
    "the inclusion of the uncertainty in the duration of the dark phase weakens the limits on the progenitor star radius to @xmath32 for sn 2011fe ( piro & nakar 2014 ; mazzali et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the estimate of the explosion time and @xmath31 can be reduced by utilizing high cadence non - detection data going back to several days prior to the first light time .",
    "for example , mazzali et al . ( 2014 ) combined their estimate of the explosion time and the non - detection of sn 2011fe around that time , and put forward a constraint of @xmath33 .",
    "this , however , depends on the accuracy of the explosion time estimate again , and the constraint on @xmath1 could be weaker if the sn 2011fe explosion occurred even before their estimate . unfortunately , there is a general lack of high cadence data prior to the first detection of sne , so that a study similar to this is not possible for the majority of sne .",
    "ultimately , a direct detection of the emission from shock - heated cooling prior to the first light time can lead to a very tight constraint on both the explosion time and the progenitor property .",
    "sn 2015f was discovered by one of us ( monard ) in ngc 2442 on 2015 mar.09.789 ( ut ) in its early phase , and has been classified as a sn ia ( fraser et al .",
    "the data from our regular monitoring program , intensive monitoring survey of nearby galaxies ( imsng ) , of ngc 2442 show a pre - discovery detection at 2015 mar.08.46 .",
    "we have been monitoring ngc 2442 on a daily basis from 2014 december 14 , and the data reveal positive signals at mar.05.57 and mar.6.55 that we interpret as an emission from shock - heated materials as we show below . in this paper , we will make use of these high cadence data to place constraints on the sn ia progenitor size . in addition",

    "december 14 , @xmath34-band images of ngc 2442 have been taken once to three times every night at a @xmath351.5 hour interval ( weather permitting ) , using sbig st-10xme camera on lsgt which provides a field of view of @xmath36 and a pixel scale of @xmath37 .",

    ", we constructed a master reference image using the lsgt data taken during 2015 january to february under good weather conditions .",
    "the reference image was convolved with a gaussian profile and flux - scaled to match the seeing and the zero - point of each epoch image .",
    "and then , the reference image was subtracted to yield a difference image .",
    "some lsgt data had better seeing than the reference image . in such cases , we convolved the later epoch data to match the reference image resolution .",
    "the subtraction of the reference image removes ngc 2442 effectively , allowing us to see sn 2015f clearly .",
    "the photometry calibration was done using calibration stars from the data release 8 ( dr8 ) of the aavso photometric all - sky survey ( apass ; henden et al .",
    "2012 ) . the @xmath38 and @xmath39-band data were taken directly from apass values , and the @xmath34-band values of calibration stars were obtained by converting apass @xmath43 and @xmath44-band photometry to the johnson @xmath34-system using a sdss photometry transformation equation in the form of @xmath45 with a dispersion of @xmath46 mag .",
    "this procedure gives photometry zero - point for each epoch data , with a typical zero - point error of 0.02 mag .",
    "the photometry was done by running sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) on images before ( for calibration stars ) and after ( for sn 2015f ) the subtraction of the reference image .",
    "we used @xmath47 diameter aperture and applied an aperture correction that was derived from stars in the vicinity .",
    "the use of this size of aperture has an advantage of minimizing residual fluxes of extended features coming from an imperfect galaxy subtraction , if present .",
    "upper limits at 3@xmath48 are adopted for non - detections .",
    "the discovery image and subsequent images of sn 2015f were also taken with a sbig - st8-xme camera ( no filter ) on meade 12 or 14 inch rcx400 telescopes at the kleinkaroo observatory in south africa .",
    "stacked images of three to four 13 s frames were used to search for sne , and more than ten 13 s images were taken during the follow - up observation each night .",
    "the images were first calibrated with a standard reduction procedure of dark subtraction and flat - fielding and stacked to create a deeper image .",
    "an image of ngc 2442 taken before the sn detection was subtracted to create a difference image on which the photometry was performed in the same way as the lsgt data . for these data ,",
    "color transformation equations were derived using @xmath49 colors of stars in the ngc 2442 field to convert the clear magnitudes to @xmath34-band magnitudes .",
    "the transformation equation has the form of @xmath50 .",

    "for the @xmath49 color of the supernova , we first took the dereddened @xmath49 values of sn 2011fe at the same number of days from the @xmath55band maximum ( richmond & smith 2012 ) , and then reddened them using the galactic and internal ( host galaxy ) extinctions toward sn 2015f where the internal extinction comes from an analysis of the long term light curve fit ( section 3.1 ) .",

    ", the @xmath49 value estimated this way is 0.2 mag , which is in excellent agreement with the observed @xmath49 color of 0.2 mag for sn 2015f . taking into account of the fitting error for the transformation equation and the uncertainty in @xmath49 ( taken to be 0.1 mag ) , we get an uncertainty in the transformed @xmath34-band magnitude of 0.05  0.1 mag .",
    "note that @xmath49 color could be redder by 0.3 mag in the early phase , since sn 2442 is not exactly identical to sn 2011fe ( e.g. , yamanaka et al .",

    "the first two of these quantities , distance modulus and host galaxy extinction , play an important role in our analysis of the early light curves and constraining the progenitor size .",
    "importantly , prior to this work , the distance to ngc 2442 has been poorly known , with published distance values varying from 17 mpc ( tully 1988 ) to a more updated value of the distance modulus @xmath69 31.66@xmath70 ( @xmath71 mpc ) that is based on the group distance ( tully et al .",

    "we adopt the result of a single power - law fit for the following discussion , since it gives the best fit to our data . however , we should bear in mind that the first light time can be much smaller than the value inferred from the single power - law fit as was the case for sn 2013dy ( zheng et al .",
    "2013 ) and sn 2014j ( goobar et al . 2014 ) .    in the previous section",
    ", we mentioned that the uncertainty in @xmath49 color in the early light curve may cause a systematic offset of 0.03  0.07 mag through the transformation of clear magnitudes to @xmath34-band magnitude for the south african data .",
    "we find that the small offset in the photometry does not alter the fitting results much ( well within the error estimates ) .",
    "this is because that the lsgt data are the most constraining data for the light curve fitting , and that the small systematic offset does not exceed errors of the south african photometry data points .",
    "to search for possible precursor uv / optical emission from shock - heated materials , we analyzed all the imaging data before the first detection that go back to 2014 december 14 .",
    "the images taken at each night were stacked together to create a deeper image . through this process , we created stacked images at 40 epochs before the first detection .",
    "an aperture photometry with a @xmath47 diameter was performed at the position of sn 2015f in the difference images at each epoch .",
    "the result is presented in figure 4 .",
    "interestingly , we find that the measurements from two epochs , at 3 and 2 days before the first detection , show weak but positive signals at 2@xmath48 significance ( or @xmath115 ab mag ) .",
    "the significance of the combined signal from the two epochs is 3@xmath48 , and thus the formal probability of this being a true detection is 99.7% .",
    "however , we caution that any unrecognized instrumental effects could produce a spurious signal at this level . therefore , we varied our image reduction and analysis methods by choosing different sets of images to construct a reference image and performing additional flat - fielding using skyflats made from images of other targets observed during the same period .",
    "we also adopted various background annuli for the photometry .",
    "even after these changes , the signal persisted at a similar statistical significance .",
    "we checked the detector temperatures during the monitoring observation , and we find them to be stable over the course of the monitoring period , i.e. , no anomaly in the detector temperature during these two nights .",
    "sn 2015f was placed at different locations on the chip in each time it was observed , but no hot / warm pixels or other detector defects were found in these positions including the mar.05 and mar.06 data .",
    "spurious , non - astrophysical signals can potentially be identified by examining source fwhm values .",
    "the fwhm values of astrophysical sources should be similar to those of stars in the same image . as a test",
    ", we inserted artificial stars at random locations in the images with the same flux as our potential detection and the seeing fwhm values that match the stellar fwhm values ( @xmath41 and @xmath116 for mar.05 and mar.06 respectively ) .",
    "we find no significant difference between the injections and our detection in size or shape , although we caution that the test is not definitive in this case due to the low detection s / n .    given that no 2@xmath48 signal was detected over two consecutive nights in the other 38 consecutive epoch - pairs",
    ", we suggest that this is not a spurious signal .",
    "based on the 39 consecutive epoch - pair measurements , we set a conservative probability of 2.6% ( 1/39 ) for two consecutive 2@xmath48 detections occurring randomly at a particular time window .",
    "therefore , we consider that the probability of this signal being real is @xmath2 97.4% .    if the signal is due to the shock - heated cooling emission , the dark phase period corresponds to @xmath117 days .",
    "if the signal at @xmath118 days is due to a random coincidence , then the dark phase period would be @xmath119 days .",
    "dark phase periods have been noted for sn 2010jn ( @xmath31=1.0 day , hachinger et al .",
    "2013 ) , sn 2009ig ( @xmath120 day ; piro & nakar 2014 ) and sn 2011fe ( @xmath31 = 0.5 to 1.5 day ; mazzali et al .",
    "2014 ; piro & nakar 2014 ) , with respect to the first light time estimates from a single power - law or a @xmath121 light curve .",
    "therefore , the inferred dark period of @xmath122 days is reasonable , given the dark phase estimates for the other sne ia and theoretical expectations .    to constrain the progenitor property with this possible shock - heated cooling signal , we use analytic models of the bolometric light curve and the temperature curve by rw11 and k10 .",

    "( 3 ) describes the case with a viewing angle that gives nearly maximal observable signal of the shock - heated cooling emission (  optimal viewing angle `` ) .",
    "we define the ' ' common viewing angle \" as the angle that corresponds roughly to an 80 percentile of the viewing angle where the observed signal is 10% of the signal under the optimal viewing angle ( bloom et al . 2012 ) . to model the common viewing angle case , we simply scaled the optimal viewing angle prediction by a factor of 10 .",
    "these theoretical light curves are plotted in figure 3 for several different values of @xmath31 that range from 0.5 to 2.5 days , and for a range of @xmath1 values . in figure 4 ,",

    "we find that the observed signal can be explained with a variety of progenitor systems . with the rw11 model",
    ", a progenitor radius of @xmath147 fits the data well , which is consistent with a dd system that undergoes a prompt detonation ( pakmor et al .",
    "2012 ; tanikawa et al .",
    "2015 ) and a sd system where the white dwarf is a recurrent nova with rapid mass accretion of hydrogen - rich matter ( e.g. , hachisu & kato 2003 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "this result is inconsistent with a dd system with a long - delayed explosion ( yoon et al .",
    "2007 ) and with a sd system where the white dwarf radius is predicted as small as @xmath148 at the shock breakout ( hoflich et al .",
    "2009 ; yoon & langer 2004 ; woosley & kasen 2011 ) .",
    "for the k10 model , the result can be explained by a sd system with a companion star with @xmath149 ",

    "this result excludes cases where a companion star has @xmath153 like that of a subgiant of a red giant star .",
    "clearly , our constraints on @xmath1 depends critically on how significant the detected signal is . alternatively",
    ", we can take a more conservative approach of considering 3@xmath48 upper limits only to place a limit on @xmath1 . with the upper limits that extend to several days before the first detection",
    ", we can still provide a meaningful constraint on the progenitor system that is largely independent of @xmath31 .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , we calculated @xmath1 values for 3@xmath48 limits at epochs that follows an assumed explosion time .",
    "the smallest value among such @xmath1 values , is taken to be an upper limit on @xmath1 , @xmath154 .",
    "when @xmath155 , the light curve peak of the shock - heated cooling emission appears within 1 day of the explosion ( figure 4 ) , so @xmath154 is determined by a 3@xmath48 upper limit that is closest in time to the assumed explosion time in such a case .",
    "we also need to consider @xmath156 , the minimal radius that one can probe with a given set of time series observation .",
    "this is necessary since the shock - heated cooling emission can drop suddenly when the diffusion wave reaches material where the gas pressure dominates the radiation pressure ( rabinak et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "this limits the duration of the shock - heated cooling curve in such a way that the larger the progenitor is , the longer the duration becomes . for a given time @xmath157 since the explosion , the size of the progenitor for which the light curve drop suddenly at @xmath157 can be given as @xmath158 where @xmath159 is time in units of 4hr ( rw11 ; bloom et al .",
    "2012 ) . for one day cadence observation",

    ", we show @xmath161 , and @xmath162 as a function of the assumed explosion time for which the time of the first detection of the radioactively powered light curve is set to 0 . for @xmath154",
    ", we used the rw11 model ( the dashed line ) , and the k10 model for two cases  one for an optimal viewing angle to detect the shock - heated cooling emission ( the dotted line ) , and another for a much less optimal viewing angle that produces about 10% of the observed emission under an optimal viewing angle ( the dot - dashed line ) . at a given time",
    ", the larger value between @xmath154 and @xmath162 can be taken as the constraint on the progenitor size .",
    "the figure shows sawtooth - like curves for both @xmath163 and @xmath162 , which result from the cadence of our data points .",
    "the constraint on @xmath1 is the strongest when the explosion time is near our data points in such a way that the maximum of the light curve coincides with the epochs where the data were taken . as we noted earlier , the explosion time is most likely at between the first light time of a single power - law fit and a few days before it . in such cases ,",
    "we find that @xmath1 stays at @xmath164 for fluxes coming from a progenitor star ( rw11 ) or interaction with a companion star at an optimal viewing angle . for the k10 model with a less optimal viewing angle",
    ", we find that @xmath165 .",
    "if the explosion time falls between the first detection time and one day before it , then the constraint on the progenitor system becomes about 10 times weaker .",
    "these limits are in agreement with the inferred progenitor size from the possible shock - heated cooling emission as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the constraint of @xmath164 excludes many possible sn ia progenitors . as discussed in bloom et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , h - burning or he - burning ms stars with @xmath166 would have radii of @xmath167 and can be excluded .",
    "c - burning ms stars are expected to have @xmath168 ( boozer et al .",
    "1973 ) , and many such stars can be excluded when @xmath169 .",
    "a useful constraint on a companion star can be obtained too .",
    "our result suggests that the radius of a companion star should be @xmath170 even if the viewing angle is not in an optimal direction .",
    "this excludes red giant stars with 1 - 2 @xmath130 that would have radii @xmath171 .",
    "ms sub - giants with 5  6 @xmath130 would have radii @xmath172 , and they can be excluded too .",
    "ms stars with @xmath173 are consistent with our limit .",
    "in this paper , we presented the light curve of a sn ia , sn 2015f , between -84 and 41 days with respect to the first light time .",
    "our data caught the rise of sn 2015f at a daily cadence , providing an estimate of the first light time of 1.6 days before the first detection ( single power - law fit ) . through our light curve analysis",
    ", we determined the distance to ngc 2442 and sn 2015f to be @xmath8 mpc , and the reddening parameter of @xmath79 .",
    "more importantly , we detected a possible signal from shock - heated cooling emission at -3 and -2 days prior to the first detection of the radioactively powered light .",
    "additionally , we obtained upper limits for any precursor emission over 40 nights before the first detection .",
    "the possible detection of the shock - heated cooling emission places stringent limits on the sn 2015f progenitor , allowing a @xmath174 progenitor system ( such as in a prompt detonation of a dd system ) , or companion stars with @xmath175  @xmath176 in a sd system .",
    "on the other hand , the possible detection and the upper limits around and before the first light time exclude a very small progenitor with @xmath177 , large progenitors with @xmath178 or a very large companion star with @xmath179 , and these conclusions are largely independent on the exact time of the explosion time .",
    "the detected shock - heated cooling emission is at a level of @xmath180 mag at @xmath181 mpc and with various kinds of extinctions along the line of sight ( @xmath182 mag ) .",
    "this detection , although marginal ( @xmath2 97.4% ) , indicates that high cadence observation of sne ia is a very promising way to probe their progenitor systems that have been elusive in the previous searches .",
