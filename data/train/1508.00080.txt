    ", it is easy to analyze the existence and stability conditions of these states , and the basion of attraction for each state in the coexistence region can also be conveniently determined @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why we introduce the invariant manifold governed by low - dimensional dynamics .",
    "as we see , in the case with only finite oscillators , the ensemble order parameter plays the dominant role in revealing the key collective structure of the system .",
    "the price of the ensemble order parameter description is the error induced by the statistical independence assumption , whose validity can be checked by numerical results . in the next section",
    "we will see that when more than three fourier coefficients of the coupling function are nonzero , where the traditional order parameter scheme fails , one can still discuss the collective dynamics in terms of the ensemble order parameter approach .",

    "an interesting issue here is the reason why we set all the @xmath246 other than @xmath249 . to see this",
    ", we just substitute the relation @xmath250 into the odd part of eq .",

    "consider a coupling function with the first five nonzero fourier coefficients , as @xmath260 the corresponding equations of order parameters read now @xmath261 with @xmath46 , @xmath36 . in this case , if we suppose @xmath127 , then two different dynamical equations will be obtained @xmath262 hence we will have @xmath263 as the requirement of coincidence of these two equations .",
    "the relation of @xmath264 is broken by the conjugate terms and there is no way in finding out a separated solution as we did for eq .",

    ", we can obtain the dynamical equations for @xmath51 as @xmath271 which can be regarded as the main term of the dynamics eq .",
    "( [ e32 ] ) . from now on we call this approach _ dominating - term assumption_. we will further show that this approximation is pretty efficient in dealing with systems with complicated coupling functions .    let us take the system described by eq .",
    "( [ ea2 ] ) as an example . by considering higher terms",
    ", we have the dynamical equations @xmath272 where @xmath273 and @xmath274 , @xmath275 , @xmath276 with @xmath277 . by introducing the dominating - term assumption ,",

    "( [ e33 ] ) can be used to study the collective behaviors of the coupled oscillators , which can be regarded as a sort of approximate low - dimensional behaviors .",
    "the validity of the dominating - term assumption can be checked via numerical simulations . for the initial state chosen from the poisson kernel distribution , by using numerical simulation",
    ", we have the order parameter from the continuity equation of the phase density and the approximate manifold . in fig . [ fig:5](a ) the order parameter @xmath51 is plotted .",
    "it can be found that the result in terms of the dominating - term approximation coincides very well with numerical results . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5](b ) , the density of oscillators at a given time is also plotted , and the result shows that though the distribution is indeed no longer the poisson kernel distribution , it is instead close to it .",

    "( b ) distribution of phase variables getting form numerical simulation ( red ) and reconstituting poisson kernel with order parameter @xmath51 ( blue ) .",
    "the system considered as @xmath279,height=132 ]    according to numerical results , we can see that the dominating - term assumption works pretty well , and the system shows approximated low - dimensional behaviors . with the dynamical equations for the first order parameter eq .",
    "( [ e33 ] ) , we can do the study further to find the property of collective behaviors of the system , which will be discussed in detail in another paper .",
    "in this paper , we focused on the theoretical description of low - dimensional order - parameter dynamics of the collective behaviors in coupled phase oscillators .",
    "we have derived the closed form of dynamical equations for order parameters , from which we find the poisson kernel as an invariant manifold and the well - known oa ansatz .",
    "different from the traditional ott - antonsen ansatz and watanabe - strogatz s approach , our approach is suitable for systems of both finite and infinite , identical and nonidentical oscillators . in our approach , the scope of the oa ansatz is determined as two parts , i.e. , the limit of infinitely many oscillators and the condition that only the first three fourier coefficients of the coupling strength are nonzero .    by using our order parameter analysis , we also discussed two cases that go beyond the scope of the oa ansatz , i.e. , the case of a finite - size system and the case of coupled oscillator systems with more complicated coupling functions .",
    "we have discussed the reasons why the oa ansatz can not be used directly to these two cases and we further developed the approximation methods to deal with these difficulties with the oa ansatz .",
    "we developed two methods , namely the ensemble method and dominating - term assumption .",
    "it is shown that these schemes work pretty well , and their validity has been checked by the numerical simulations .",
    "for the case of a finite number of coupled oscillators , it is shown that the system is out of the domain of low - dimensional manifold of the coupled order parameter equations .",
    "hence , from the view of the geometry theory of manifolds , the finite size of system brings some fluctuations along the manifold which is introduced from initial states .",
    "if the dynamics of order parameter equations is not too complicated and the manifold satisfying @xmath127 can be used to describe the dynamics approximately , all the trajectories from different initial conditions around the poisson manifold will be described by the mechanism of this manifold approximately .",
    "this is the meaning of the ensemble method and the reason for why it works in some models .    in other case , with a more complicated coupling function ,",
    "the poisson manifold is not a solution of the dynamical system .",
    "however , for the infinitely many coupled equations for @xmath19 , except for few of them , the relation @xmath127 indeed reflects the symmetry of these order parameter equations .",
    "when we choose the initial states in this manifold , the evolution of the dynamics will certainly be influenced by the symmetry of it , which is described by @xmath127 approximately .",
    "the method with dominating - term assumption is indeed designed to show this effect , and consequently the system is simplified by it for some models .    in this paper , we have developed the order parameter analysis , with which we get the low - dimensional behaviors of coupled phase oscillators , such as the oa ansatz , the ensemble order parameter approach and the dominating - term approximation . however , to fully understand the low - dimensional collective behaviors we need a more comprehensive understanding of the poisson manifold and its relation with the dynamics of the system , which is still an open question .",
    "we believe that the order parameter analysis should be a powerful tool in helping to reveal the mechanism of low - dimensional collective behaviors .",
