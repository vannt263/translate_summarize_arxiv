    "full heusler alloys ( fha ) have drawn considerable attention of the researchers as some of them show shape memory alloy property . in this family",
    ", ni@xmath0mnga is the most studied prototype ferromagnetic shape memory alloy .",
    "it is reported that ni@xmath0mnga shows large magnetic field induced strain ( mfis ) as well as magnetoresistance effect ( mre ) , which makes ni@xmath0mnga a potential material to be used as sensors , actuators etc.@xcite however , the basic drawbacks of this material in terms of technological application are its brittleness and the low martensite transition temperature ( t@xmath1 which is 210 k)@xcite , because from the application point of view , it is mandatory that t@xmath1 should be above room temperature . in the literature ,",
    "it is reported that , for this type of fha systems , the t@xmath1 , curie temperature ( t@xmath2 ) as well as the inherent crystalline brittleness ( icb ) are highly dependent on the composition .",
    "hence , there is a vast amount of work searching for new heusler alloys with improved properties , which include low icb , as well as t@xmath1 and t@xmath2 above room teperature .",
    "this is important from the point of view of technological application , for example , as actuators , sensors etc.@xcite there are also some shape memory alloys found in the literature which are termed as high temperature shape memory alloys ( htsma ) , whose martensite transition temperature is above about 120@xmath3c ( i.e. 393 k ) and they find their application in engines of automobiles , turbines , airplanes etc.@xcite    there is another class of fhas which is seen to be half metallic in nature.@xcite in this kind of heusler alloys , density of states of either the majority or the minority spin vanishes at the fermi level and these materials have potential application as spintronic devices .",
    "generally , many of the co - based heusler alloys exhibit this behaviour , like , co@xmath0crga , co@xmath0mnga , co@xmath0mnsn.@xcite however , some metallic co - based materials , like , co@xmath0nbsn , co@xmath0niga are found to exhibit shape memory alloy property.@xcite hence , it may be worth probing if there are co - based heusler alloys which show both the properties i.e. shape memory property as well as high spin polarization at the fermi level .",
    "one such material , co@xmath0moga , has recently been predicted by us.@xcite    currently , co@xmath0niga and related alloys have gained interest among the researchers .",
    "some of these have been studied in detail theoretically@xcite as well as have already been prepared experimentally.@xcite interestingly , co@xmath0niga shows the shape memory alloy property as well as it possesses different ( inverse heusler alloy ) structure compared to many of the co - based systems , which are known to exhibit half - metallicity and have the conventional heusler alloy structure in their ground state .",
    "it is to be further noted that , the co - based materials possess reasonably high curie temperature .",
    "all these above - mentioned findings in the literature have motivated us to probe the co@xmath0niga - derived heusler alloy systems .",
    "it is to be further noted that , in a very recent work@xcite it has been shown that , substitution of ni by pt in case of ni@xmath0mnga reduces the inherent crystalline brittleness as well as it makes the tetragonal state more stable compared to its cubic phase . besides that , mario et al have observed an enhancement of t@xmath2 in case of co doping in the pt based systems.@xcite so , studying the literature@xcite , we can expect that , the effect of replacement of ni by pt on various physical properties of co@xmath0niga may turn out to be interesting both from fundamental as well as application points of view .",
    "furthermore , number of valence electrons of the system has been shown to play an important role in determining the properties of these alloy systems . in this work ,",
    "therefore , we have discussed the changes in the magnetic , electronic as well as mechanical properties of x@xmath0ptga as x is varied and the number of valence electrons of the x element , which is a first row transition metal atom ( tm ) , changes systematically ( x being cr , mn , fe , co ) . among these materials",
    "mn@xmath0ptga is already experimentally prepared and theoretically studied.@xcite it shows an inverse heusler alloy structure and possesses a ferrimagnetic configuration as is the case for mn@xmath0niga.@xcite we compare our calculated results with the data in the literature , wherever available . in what follows , first , we give a brief account of the method we used and then we present the results and discussion . in the end ,",
    "the results of this work are summarized and conclusions are drawn .",
    "the geometry optimization of all the materials have been carried out using vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp)@xcite where the projector augmented wave method ( paw)@xcite is implemented .",
    "for the exchange - correlation functional , generalized gradient approximation has been used over local density approximation.@xcite we have used the energy cut - off for plane wave expansion of 500  ev . the calculations of energies have been performed with a @xmath4 mesh of 15@xmath515@xmath515 for the cubic case and for the tetragonal phase also we have used similar kind of @xmath4 mesh .",
    "all the calculations have been carried out with the energy and the force tolerance were 10 @xmath6ev and 10 mev /  , respectively . for cubic crystals",
    "there are three independent elastic constants namely @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . to find these three independent constants we have applied three different kind of strains on the geometrically optimized cubic structure of the respective systems using vasp code .",
    "these strains are ( @xmath10 , @xmath10 , @xmath10 , 0 , 0 , 0)(@xmath11 ) , ( 0 , 0 , @xmath10@xmath12/(1- @xmath10@xmath12 ) , 0 , @xmath10)(@xmath13 ) and ( @xmath10 , @xmath10 , ( 1+@xmath10)@xmath14 - 1 , 0 , 0 , 0)(@xmath15 ) . the applied strain should be as small as possible ; in our case we have applied strain varying from 0.02 to -0.02 in steps of 0.005 .",
    "it is well known that , all - electron calculations are more reliable for the prediction of magnetic properties particularly for the systems containing first row transition elements .",
    "hence , we have carried out all electron spin polarized relativistic calculations on the optimized geometry for all the systems using full potential linearised augmented plane wave method ( fplapw).@xcite for exchange - correlation functional , generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite over local density approximation is used .",
    "an energy cut - off for plane wave expansion was used of about 16 ry ( @xmath16@xmath17 = 9.5 ) .",
    "the cut - off for charge density was g@xmath18=14 .",
    "the number of @xmath4 points in the self - consistent - field calculation is 8000 ( 256 ) in the cubic case , whereas for the tetragonal case the number is 8000 ( 635 ) in the reducible ( irreducible ) brillouin zone ( bz ) . to get detailed insight about the magnetic interaction between the constituent atoms ,",
    "we have used spin - polarized - relativistic korringa - kohn - rostoker method ( sprkkr ) as implemented in sprkkr package@xcite , which provides the heisenberg exchange coupling constants ( j@xmath19 ) . from j@xmath19",
    "we have calculated t@xmath2 following the approach of liechtenstein et al.@xcite the scf calculations have been carried out with the local density approximation as the exchange - correlation potential and a @xmath4 mesh of 21@xmath521@xmath521 in the bz were used and further an angular expansion upto @xmath20 was considered for each atom .",
    "_ geometry optimization _ - fhas in the cubic phases crystallize in two types of crystal structures , namely , conventional heusler alloy structure and inverse heusler alloy structure . in case of fha",
    "there are four fcc sublattices centered at ( 0.25 , 0.25 , 0.25 ) , ( 0.75 , 0.75 , 0.75 ) , ( 0.50 , 0.50 , 0.50 ) , ( 0.00 , 0.00 , 0.00 ) , which we label as a , b , c and d sublattices , respectively . in case of a conventional heusler alloy structure ( with a formula x@xmath0yz ) ,",
    "the x atom occupies the a and b sublattices , the y atom occupies the c sublattice and d sublattice is occupied by the z atom .",
    "this x@xmath0yz structure shows a fm@xmath21 m ( number 225 ) space group . on the other hand , in case of inverse heusler alloy structure ( with a formula xyxz ) , x atom occupies the a and c sublattices and they are termed as x2 and x1 , respectively , y atom occupies the b sublattice whereas the z atom occupies the d sublattice .",
    "this xyxz structure assumes a f@xmath223 m ( number 216 ) space group .",
    "full geometry optimization has been carried out for both the possibilities for all the materials .",
    "table  1 .",
    "comparison of formation energies between inverse and conventional heusler alloy structure with different magnetic configurations .",
    "lattice parameters after geometry optimization are also reported.ref . ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     cauchy pressure ( @xmath23 ) is defined as the difference between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the value of @xmath23 indicates the nature of bonding in a system.@xcite for all the systems studied here @xmath23 is found to be positive .",
    "pugh phenomenologically related the ratio between shear modulus and bulk modulus ( @xmath24/@xmath25 ) to the inherent crystalline brittleness of a material.@xcite in the estimation of shear modulus we have followed the formalism given by voigt@xcite(@xmath26 ) over given by reuss@xcite(@xmath27 ) .",
    "this is because @xmath27 is largely underestimated for the materials which show softening of @xmath28 ; the reason behind this has been discussed in detail in our previous work.@xcite if the ratio ( @xmath24/@xmath25 ) is greater than @xmath290.57 , the corresponding crystalline material is supposed to be inherently brittle .",
    "according to our calculations , co@xmath0ptga is predicted to possess the lowest inherent crystalline brittleness .",
    "the upper panel of figure 8 shows an inverse linear relationship between @xmath23 and @xmath24/@xmath25 (= @xmath26/@xmath25 ) . this inverse linear relationship between these two parameters",
    "is already reported in literature for a large number of systems.@xcite figure 8 ( a ) suggests that the icb of co@xmath0ptga is quite low with respect to that of ni@xmath0mnga .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 8 shows the variation of @xmath24/@xmath25 as a function of atomic number ( z ) of the x atom of x@xmath0ptga ( x = cr , mn , fe , co ) .",
    "it is to be noted that the value of @xmath24/@xmath25 is lowest for z = 27 , i.e. for co@xmath0ptga . in literature@xcite",
    "it has been mentioned that the materials with lower value of @xmath24 are likely to undergo shear deformation and become more prone to ductility instead of brittle fracture when strain is applied which leads to a higher inherent crystalline brittleness .",
    "versus @xmath26/@xmath25 plot : a linear fitting has been done , which shows an inverse linear relationship between them .",
    "ni@xmath0mnga is used as a reference material .",

    "al.@xcite have correlated the elastic constant @xmath7 of the cubic metallic as well as interametallic systems with the melting temperature by the following empirical relationship : @xmath31 calculated @xmath32@xmath33 values for all the systems ( table 4 ) are predicted to be sufficiently high for a possible application as sma even at high temperature , specifically for co@xmath0ptga , which is predicted to possess @xmath34 ( around 886 k ) well above the room temperature .",
    "from first - principles calculations , we study the electronic and magnetic properties of x@xmath0ptga ( x being cr , mn , fe , co ) heusler alloys .",
    "we predict a few new materials with pt being an essential ingredient . by comparing the energies of various types of magnetic configurations",
    ", we predict that cr@xmath0ptga and mn@xmath0ptga possess a ferrimagnetic configuration , whereas , fe@xmath0ptga and co@xmath0ptga possess a long - range ferromagneic ordering in their respective ground states .",
    "analysing the electronic , magnetic and mechanical properties of all these materials , we predict that , co@xmath0ptga , cr@xmath0ptga and fe@xmath0ptga are found to be three new full heusler alloy systems , which are likely to show the martensite transition . among these",
    "co@xmath0ptga is likely to possess the highest spin polarization at the fermi level for both the cubic and tetragonal phases .",
    "it also exhibits the lowest inherent crystalline brittleness as well as the highest martensite transition ( @xmath34 ) , melting temperature ( @xmath35 ) and curie temperature ( @xmath36 ) ; all of these well above the room temperature .",
