    "the sharp increase in the mean - square charge radius is observed in the odd mass @xmath0hg isotopes with respect to their even neighbors @xcite . a hint that a very different configuration may constitute the ground state of these nuclei was given by an isomer shift measurement of @xmath1hg @xcite , where they found an excited state of @xmath1hg which has a charge radius consistent with the charge radius of heavier neighbors .",
    "the sharp increase in the charge radius was interpreted as the transition from a nearly spherical to a deformed shape in the ground state of the odd mass @xmath0hg isotopes .",
    "frauendorf and pashkevich @xcite calculated the deformation energy of hg isotopes by means of strutinsky s shell correction method .",
    "they found that the light hg isotope has an oblate and prolate minimum of nearly the same depth at the respective deformations @xmath2 and 0.22 .",
    "they discussed a mechanism which causes the transition from a small oblate to a large prolate deformation in the odd mass @xmath0hg isotopes .",
    "they noticed that the neutron level density is very high in the almost spherical oblate minimum , whereas the neutron level density is low in the well deformed prolate minimum .",
    "they concluded that the loss of pairing energy due to the blocking of the fermi level by the odd neutron is larger in the oblate minimum than in the prolate one , which gives rise to the oblate - prolate transition in the ground state of these isotopes .",
    "as the prolate minimum corresponds to deformation twice as large as the oblate one , the sharp increase in the mean - square radius is observed in the odd - mass light hg isotopes .",
    "there are several mean field calculations of hg isotopes .",
    "however , all of them are limited to even isotopes @xcite . in order to see if the mechanism of frauendorf and pashkevich works well , we perform hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculations of hg isotopes with effective interactions siii @xcite , ski3 @xcite and sly4 @xcite .",
    "we calculate lipkin - nogami corrections @xcite to both mean field and pairing energies @xcite .",

    "the value of @xmath36 mev is assumed in the present study .",
    "the above formalism can be straightforwardly extended to the case of one quasi - particle state in odd mass nuclei .",
    "all the equation retain their form . only the density matrix @xmath37 and pairing tensor @xmath38",

    "in such a case , all 20 coupling constants in eq .",

    "the neutron level density is high in the oblate minimum , while it is low in the prolate minimum .",
    "because of the difference of level densities in the respective minima , it happens that neutrons in the oblate minimum are superconductive , whereas they are normal in the prolate minimum within the same isotope .",
    "the situation is extremely inconvenient because we want discuss the energy difference between the oblate and prolate minimum . besides , a sudden phase - transition from the normal to superconductive state or vice versa at certain neutron numbers may be unphysical and it may be due to the defect of the number non - conserving pairing scheme . in the present study we employ the approximate number - projection method of lipkin and nogami ( ln ) @xcite and",

    "the parameter @xmath58 is given by the particle number condition , whereas the parameter @xmath59 is held fixed during the variation and is determined after the variation from the additional condition , @xmath60 @xmath61 equation ( [ lam2 ] ) is calculated by the following density matrix and pairing tensor @xcite ; @xmath62 for an odd nucleus , the density matrix and pairing tensor of eqs .",

    "shape transition occurs only in the odd - mass isotopes as the result of a subtle balance between the time - even mean - field energy , the loss of pairing energy by the odd neutron and the time - odd mean - field energy .",

    "we have investigated the effect of time - odd mean - field terms on the hfb energy , first by using the time - odd coupling constants derived from the skyrme force parameters and second by switching on and off the coupling constants @xmath55 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "these coupling constants in @xmath47-representation @xcite are given in table [ param ] .",
    "they vary very much with different skyrme forces , e.g. , the coupling constant @xmath65 is 14 , 84 and 208 for the respective siii , ski3 and sly4 forces .",
    "the polarization energy depends strongly on the blocked level by an odd neutron .",
    "even the sign of energy changes with different choice of the blocked level . in the present study we simply choose as the blocked level the lowest quasi - particle state that is obtained from the hfbe calculation .",
    "mercury isotopes are very interesting because the shape of the ground state varies very much as the neutron number decreases from the closed shell .",
    "figure [ pes ] shows the deformation energy of even hg isotopes calculated by the constraint siii - hf method .",

    "the hf calculation ( white circle ) predicts prolate deformation in the ground state of all hg isotopes .",
    "the hfbe calculation ( black circle ) , the fully paired state without the blocking effect , predicts oblate deformation in the ground state of all hg isotopes .",
    "the shape changes due to the large gain of pairing energy in the oblate minimum because of the high level density as compared to the level density in the prolate minimum . in the siii - hfb calculation ( white square )",
    ", on the other hand , the shape of odd mass @xmath0hg isotopes returns to the prolate shape .",
    "this is because the loss of pairing energy due to the blocking by the odd neutron is also large in the oblate minimum than in the prolate one .",
    "the effect of the time - odd mean fields on the oblate - prolate transition is weak and a few tenths of the blocking effect .",
    "figure [ is ] shows the siii - hfb calculation of ( a ) the mean - square charge radius and ( b ) one - neutron separation energy of @xmath72hg isotopes .",
    "the sharp increase in the mean - square radius of the odd - mass @xmath0hg isotopes is very well explained by the calculation .",
    "the one - neutron separation energy is also well reproduced in the calculation .",
    "this is so because the depth of the pairing force has been adjusted to reproduce the observed separation energies .",
    "it is noted that the white circle in fig .",
    "[ is](b ) is a derived value from systematic trends @xcite and not an experiment .",
    "as is well known , a proper description of odd nuclei by mean field theory requires to break the time - reversal symmetry and introduces the time - odd components ( toc ) in the mean field .",
    "the effect of an odd neutron on the hfb energy is therefore twofold ; ( a ) the loss of pairing energy due to the blocking of the fermi level by the odd neutron , and ( b ) the time - odd mean - field energy arising from the blocked level .",
    "the time - odd mean fields have been studied both in the analysis of super - deformed rotational bands @xcite and the odd - even nuclear mass difference @xcite .    in order to see the blocking energy ( the loss of pairing energy ) and the polarization energy ( the time - odd mean - field energy ) separately , we define the blocking energy @xmath73 as the energy difference between @xmath74 with no toc and @xmath42 .",

    "the blocking energies are reversed in @xmath78hg because of the small deformation @xmath79 in the prolate minimum of this isotope and the level density in the minimum is high accordingly .    as mentioned in section 2.2 ,",
    "the @xmath80 and @xmath81 terms are free from the time - even parameterization .",
    "to investigate their effects on the hfb energy , we have further divided the polarization energy into contributions with ( i ) the full time - odd terms , ( ii ) the time - odd terms without @xmath51 , ( iii ) the time - odd terms without @xmath55 , and ( iv ) the time - odd terms without both @xmath51 and @xmath55 . in the following we assume simultaneous modifications of the isoscalar and isovector coupling constants of a given species .",
