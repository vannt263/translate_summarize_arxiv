    "another connection is via logarithmic potentials which are required for @xmath138 supergravity and are present in string theory motivated supergravity . and finally , the value of the positive cosmological constant in our models can be only explained with the reference to the string landscape .",
    "the mass of gravitino , @xmath3 , and the level of gravity waves , @xmath4 , are free parameters in our new cosmological models , to be determined by the future experiments .",
    "the progress in this direction was based on a better understanding of moduli stabilization and on the use of supergravity models with the universal spontaneous supersymmetry breaking via a fermionic goldstino multiplet .",
    "the reason for such universality is the following : the nilpotency condition @xmath69 for @xmath139 can be satisfied only if @xmath140 . in such case",
    "the sgoldstino is not a fundamental scalar anymore but is given by a bilinear combination of fermionic goldstino s divided by the value of the auxiliary field @xmath141 s= _ s _ s2 f_s  .",
    "there is no non - trivial solution if susy is unbroken and @xmath142 , i.e. only @xmath143 solve the equation @xmath69 . thus by requiring to have a fermion volkov - akulov goldstino nilpotent multiplet in supergravity theory we end up with the universal value of the supergravity potential at its minimum , with @xmath144 v = e^k ( |f_s |^2 - 3     our minimal supergravity models depend on two superfields ,",
    "one of them typically represented using either a poincare - disk variable @xmath76 , or a half - plane variable @xmath78 .",
    "a new variable @xmath49 which we used extensively in this paper describes the same geometry but in a killing adapted frame where the metric does not depend on the inflaton direction .",
    "we call @xmath49 a killing variable .",
    "we explained the relation between these three holomorphic variables in section  [ sect : killing ] .",
    "the canonically normalized inflaton in our models is @xmath84 .",
    "the inflaton partner scalar @xmath145 is supposed to vanish , which happens automatically during inflation in the models considered in this paper . in all our models in @xmath49-variables",
    "the inflaton shift - symmetric potential is @xmath146 + s \\bar{s}$ ] and the superpotential is @xmath147 .",
    "the nilpotent multiplet @xmath53 does not have fundamental scalars , it has only a fermionic goldstino .    in models with a canonical potential for",
    "the nilpotent multiplet @xmath148 stabilization of @xmath101 in all models presented in this paper does not require any additional stabilization terms , as long as @xmath149 . for smaller @xmath5 one can stabilize @xmath101 by adding a bisectional curvature term to the potential of the form ( in disk variables )",
    "thus , in presence of the nilpotent superfield @xmath53 the problem of stabilization of the direction orthogonal to the inflaton is solved during inflation as well as at the minimum of the potential .",
    "an unexpected benefit from the new tools for moduli stabilization during inflation was realized very recently .",
    "many examples of previously known supergravity models , compatible with current and future cosmological observations , can now easily describe dark energy via tiny de sitter vacua , and spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry . in this paper",
    "we provide examples of such generalizations of @xmath5-attractor models @xcite .",
    "these models interpolate between various polynomial models @xmath150 at very large @xmath5 and attractor line for @xmath151 , see figs . 1 , 2 . therefore they are flexible with regard to data on b - modes , @xmath4 .",
    "they provide a seamless natural fit to planck data . for these kinds of cosmological models",
    "we have shown that it is possible to break supersymmetry without an additional hidden sector , with a controllable parameter of supersymmetry breaking . with inflationary scale",
    "@xmath152 the scale of supersymmetry breaking can be @xmath153 , compatible with the discovery of supersymmetry at lhc . with @xmath154",
    "tev we will have equally good inflationary models , compatible with an absence of observed supersymmetry at lhc .",
    "in fact , such inflationary models are even easier to construct .    in this paper we developed two methods of constructing inflationary models with supersymmetry breaking and de sitter minimum .",
    "one is the reconstruction method in section  [ sect : reconstruction ] , which allows to take any desirable inflationary models , in particular our @xmath5-attractor models , and enhance them by susy breaking and a small cosmological constant .",
    "an advantage of this method , following @xcite , is that it is powerful and easy .",
    "it requires only a simple integration of a given function .",
    "thus one can obtain nearly arbitrary inflationary potentials , just as it was done in @xcite , so one can fit any set of observational data in the context of supergravity - based models of inflation .",
    "moreover , in all of these models one can introduce susy breaking of any magnitude without introducing extra scalars such as polonyi field .",
    "it can be done while preserving all desirable inflationary predictions .",
    "thus from the purely phenomenological point of view , the reconstruction method is a great tool offering us enormous flexibility .    on the other hand",
    ", this method does not use specific advantages of the cosmological attractors , including their geometric origin and stability of their predictions with respect to the change of the inflationary potential . in this sense , the method used for deriving the model described in section  [ sect : genmodels ] , as well as of some other similar models found earlier in @xcite , preserves the attractor features of the theory by construction , for all values of the susy breaking parameters and arbitrary cosmological constant .",
    "some of the features of these models ( the existence of a ds valley of a constant width and depth shown in fig .",
    "3 ) play an important role in solving the initial conditions problem for inflation in these models .",
    "the details of this analysis can be found in @xcite for @xmath5-attractor models with a minkowski minimum and unbroken susy .",
    "here we see that in generic models with de sitter exit and controllable susy breaking , initial condition problem for inflation is solved just as in the simpler case studied in @xcite .",
