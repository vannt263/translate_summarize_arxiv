    "in many problems of quantum mechanics it is important to know what happens to the wave function of a system as the bound state approaches the dissociation ( decay ) threshold . in particular , how does the size of the system in the ground state change as the system becomes loosely bound . among multiple examples of loosely bound systems in physics one could mention negative atomic and molecular ions @xcite , efimov states @xcite and halo nuclei @xcite , @xcite .    for a bound state of the system",
    "as it approaches the threshold there could be two possibilities .",
    "the first one is that the probability distribution given by this bound state spreads , meaning that the probability to find all particles together in the fixed bounded region of space goes to zero ( the size of the system goes to infinity ) .",
    "one observes such spreading in helium dimer @xcite or in halo nuclei like @xmath1he or @xmath2li , which are so loosely bound that two neutrons are about to leave the system and form dilute nuclear matter around the core nucleus ( @xmath3he and @xmath4li respectively ) @xcite .",
    "the second possibility is that the bound state does not spread and in this case it eventually becomes a _ bound state at the threshold _",
    "( the size of the system remains finite ) .",
    "this phenomenon is called the eigenvalue absorption .",
    "this is the case for doubly negative ions and proton halos @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recall , that for two particles interacting through spherically symmetric potentials with finite range @xmath5states always spread , while all states with non - zero angular momentum become bound @xcite .",
    "incidentally , it is natural to conjecture that the ground state of a multi - particle system with pair interactions of finite range ( @xmath6 for @xmath7 ) can not be bound at the threshold given that the particles are either bosons or distinguishable . for fermions with short - range interactions",
    "it is hard to say from general principles whether the ground state would spread or not .",
    "the physical approach in this case is to use some kind of shell model and to figure out if there is a centrifugal barrier , which prevents the wave function from spreading .    on the other hand , there are potentials , for which bound states do not spread at all and when approaching the continuum they give rise to bound states exactly at the threshold @xcite , @xcite . in particular , the physically important case of repulsive coulomb tail case belongs to this type ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "let us illustrate this situation by a simple example .",
    "consider the square well potential plus a repulsive coulomb tail , as in fig .  1 ( left ) , and imagine the ground state in this potential as it approaches the threshold .",
    "the probability distribution for this state would remain a confined wave packet regardless of how small is the binding energy . for zero binding energy",
    "there would be a bound state , which would have a falloff of the type @xmath8 .",
    "on the contrary , if we cut off the positive tail at some arbitrary distance @xmath9 , the ground state approaching the threshold would eventually spread when the binding energy is sufficiently small , _",
    "i.e. _ the probability to find the particle in some bounded region of space goes to zero with the binding energy .",
    "the state `` tunnels '' through the barrier .",
    "note that this change in the behavior does not depend on the value of @xmath9 , which could be as large as pleased , so this effect is solely due to the repulsive coulomb tail .",
    "this requires a special care in numerical calculations of loosely bound systems , because often in the calculations the potential becomes effectively cut off .    a rigorous proof of the eigenvalue absorption in the case of a general short - range potential plus a repulsive coulomb tail was given in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the approach presented in @xcite , based on the green s function expansion , is aimed specifically at the coulomb long - range part and does not allow generalizations , for example , to potentials having long - range parts of the form @xmath10 , which may arise in multipole expansions . here",
    ", we shall consider a more general two - body case .",
    "the analysis in @xcite illuminates the possibilities for various radially dependent long - range parts .",
    "however , the arguments given there are not rigorous .",
    "finally , we should mention , that the phenomenon of the ground state absorption was proved rigorously in @xcite for a three - body system with pure coulomb interactions and the infinitely massive core .",
    "this makes one conjecture that at the point of critical charge negative ions have bound states at the threshold , see the discussion in @xcite . in a forthcoming article",
    "we shall give the rigorous proof of this conjecture for distinguishable particles and bosons @xcite , see also the discussion concerning many - body systems in the last section .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we set the criterium for the eigenvalue absorption . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we derive useful upper bounds for the green s function .",
    "these bounds can also be used to control numerical solutions . in sec .",
    "[ mres ] we prove our main result saying that potentials decaying slower as @xmath11 give rise to bound states at the threshold .",

    "in nature we can make the bound state of the system approach the threshold by changing the number and the type of particles . in theory",
    "we reproduce this behavior changing continuously some parameters in the system .",
    "for example , in the case of ions diminishing the atomic charge @xmath12 down to the critical value @xmath13 makes the ground state approach the threshold @xcite . here , for parameter , changing which we force the states approach the threshold , we take the coupling constant of the interaction .    in our analysis",
    "we shall consider the hamiltonian of two particles @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the free hamiltonian ( we use the units where @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 is the interaction and @xmath19 is a coupling constant . by decreasing @xmath19 we can lift any bound state to the continuum . for convenience",
    "we shall consider only @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this is a large class of interactions , which allows singularities not worse than @xmath21 for @xmath22 . in this case",
    "@xmath23 is self - adjoint on the domain @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "however , one could extend our results to potentials having singularities of the type @xmath21 for @xmath25 .",
    "let us assume that there is a bound state having the energy @xmath26 for some value of the coupling constant @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath27 increases monotonously when @xmath19 decreases and eventually @xmath27 becomes zero for @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is called the critical coupling constant @xcite . in the following",
    "we show , using a simple example , how the wave function spreads in the case of exponentially decaying potentials . in this simple case the analyticity of the energy as a function of @xmath19 helps us to establish an upper bound on the wave function    [ th-1 ] if there exist @xmath30 such that @xmath31 and at @xmath28 there is no zero - energy bound state then the following upper bound holds for the bound state @xmath32 having the energy @xmath33 in the neighborhood of @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 is some constant .",
    "@xmath32 satisfies the integral equation @xmath37^{-1 } w \\psi$ ] , which could be rewritten as @xmath38 using @xmath31 and applying the schwarz inequality to eq .",
    "( [ lipsch ] ) gives us @xmath39^{1/2 } \\leq \\lambda \\left < \\psi | |w| | \\psi\\right>^{1/2 } \\frac{c ' e^{-\\sqrt{|e|}r}}{r}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is some constant and @xmath41 . on the other hand , recall @xcite that at @xmath42",
    "the energy @xmath27 is analytic and can be expanded into convergent power series @xmath43 , where @xmath44 ( @xmath45 because by condition there is no zero - energy bound state at @xmath42 ) .",
    "applying the hellman - feynman theorem @xmath46 gives us @xmath47 . because @xmath31 there must exist such constant @xmath48 that @xmath49 and thus by the uncertainty principle @xcite , @xcite @xmath50 for any @xmath51 .",
    "thus @xmath52 , which together with eq .",
    "( [ r2d2 ] ) proves the statement .",
    "as one can easily see , the function on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ psibound1 ] ) dominates the wave function and spreads as @xmath53 maintaining the constant norm independent of @xmath54 .",
    "the probability to find the particle in some fixed region of space goes to zero .",
    "now , let us consider potentials with positive tails . throughout the paper we shall assume for such potentials that @xmath55 for @xmath56 , _",
    "i.e. _ , that outside some sphere the positive part dominates .",
    "below we present a simple criterion , which tells us when bound states become bound states at the threshold . from the discussion above and from theorem  [ th-1 ] it is clear that the strategy could be proving that as @xmath57 bound states remain confined in some region of space , _ i.e. _ do not spread .",
    "one way to achieve this is to show that bound states are dominated by some fixed function @xmath58 .",
    "[ th1 ] let @xmath59 be a sequence of coupling constants and @xmath60 .",
    "the following is true ( a ) if for each @xmath59 there is a bound state @xmath61 with the energy @xmath62 such that @xmath63 , where @xmath58 and @xmath64 then there exists a normalized bound state at the threshold , that is @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "( b ) if for each @xmath59 there are @xmath67 orthogonal bound states @xmath68 with the energies @xmath69 such that @xmath70 , where @xmath58 and @xmath71 then there exist @xmath67 orthonormal bound states at the threshold .",
    "the proof of this theorem , which follows the method in @xcite , is given in the appendix .",
    "intuitively , this proposition is obvious .",
    "if the states do not spread they should finally form some bound state at the threshold .",
    "a similar theorem concerning many - body systems appeared in zhislin and zhizhenkova @xcite . there the authors proved that if a minimizing sequence for the energy functionals does not spread , then there exists a minimizer in @xmath72 .",
    "their result could be explained from practitioners point of view .",
    "imagine that the system has no bound states with negative energy .",
    "then , if the function minimizing the energy functional , does not go to zero as the number of basis functions increases , then there must exist a zero - energy bound state .    now let us see how the criterion in theorem  2 works .",
    "first , we separate positive and negative parts of the potential @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the equation for the bound states reads @xmath77 , where @xmath78 as @xmath79 .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath80 or equivalently @xmath81    the operator @xmath82 is an integral operator , whose kernel is positive and real @xcite .",
    "thus we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ bs2 ] ) as @xmath83 where because @xmath57 we have taken @xmath84 without loss of generality . if we show that the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ pre1 ] ) is bounded by some fixed square integrable function , then according to theorem  [ th1 ] we would have bound states at the threshold .",
    "the operator @xmath85 is an integral operator , and its kernel is the green s function having two arguments . because the function @xmath86 vanishes outside some sphere , the behavior of @xmath87 at infinity is determined by the asymptotic of the green s function when the integration argument is fixed within the sphere .",
    "thus to find the asymptotic we need to derive upper and lower bounds on the green s function .",
    "we introduce the function which would play the role of potential s tail : @xmath88    we are interested in the kernel of the integral operator @xmath89^{-1}$ ] for @xmath90 real , which we denote as @xmath91 .",

    "now , because @xmath94 are positive @xcite and the potential difference @xmath102 is non - negative , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eqxx ] ) must be non - negative and the statement is proved .",
    "there is another elucidating and more direct way to prove lemma  [ xx ] .",

    "( [ garc ] ) becomes smaller when @xmath106 is replaced by @xmath107 .",
    "the idea behind the upper bound on the green s function is rather simple .",

    "( [ e34 ] ) we obtain for the square of the norm @xmath287 where @xmath288 is some fixed constant . note that @xmath289 because that would mean @xmath290 .",
    "it is clear that the right - hand side in eq .",

    ", the shaded area representing stable systems . on the arcs of stability curve where either @xmath292 or @xmath293 there are bound states at the threshold.,width=226 ]",
    "we have proposed the method to derive lower and upper bounds on the green s functions , which helps to determine the fall - off of bound states . using these bounds",
    "we have proved that potentials , whose tails decay as @xmath294 , where @xmath295 is the reduced mass , absorb the eigenvalues , meaning that their bound states do not spread and become bound states at the threshold .",
    "we have also found that ground states in potentials , whose tails decay as @xmath296 , always spread as they approach the continuum .",
    "these methods can be applied to the many - particle case , where it is still not known , for which pair interactions between decaying particles or clusters the bound state would become absorbed .",
    "the difficulty is that it is hard to control the asymptotic of the many - body bound state wave function . using bounds on the green s functions derived here",
    "one can demonstrate @xcite that when there is a long - range coulomb repulsion between decaying components ( particles or clusters ) , then the bound state must get absorbed .",
    "two types of behavior , namely spreading and eigenvalue absorption can be perfectly illustrated by a stability diagram for three coulomb charges , see @xcite .",
    "when masses are fixed the diagram has the form as in fig .  2 .",
    "if we consider , for example , the upper arc , which is the stability border , it has the following property @xcite . up to some non - zero value of @xmath297 the stability border is given by the equation @xmath298 .",
    "then at the point @xmath299 the arc goes up . with the same method as here",
    "it can be proved @xcite that if one approaches the stability border from the side where @xmath298 then the ground state spreads and there is no bound state at the threshold . on the contrary , for the points on the arc the ground state becomes absorbed , _",
    "i.e. _ it does not spread and becomes a bound state at the threshold .",
    "the reason is that on the stability border , where @xmath298 the system decays into a neutral cluster and one charged particle , and for @xmath300 both cluster and the particle are charged positively .",
    "the resulting coulomb repulsion between these objects hinders the spreading of the wave function and the ground state becomes absorbed .",
    "note that it has already been proved rigorously @xcite , that in the case of an infinite core and two other masses being equal , the sharp point on the diagram , see fig .  2 , has a bound state at the threshold .",
    "our method helps to extend this result to many particles .",
    "let us prove part ( a ) .",
    "we follow the argument from @xcite . because @xmath301 we can extract a weakly converging subsequence ( for which we reserve the same index @xmath302 ) such that @xmath303 , where @xmath304 . because h is self - adjoint in order to prove that @xmath65 and @xmath305 it is enough to show that for every @xmath306 we have @xmath307 .",

    "we shall prove this by contradiction assuming that @xmath310 .",
    "let us introduce @xmath311 , the characteristic function of the interval @xmath312 $ ] ( _ i.e. _ @xmath313 when @xmath314 $ ] and @xmath315 otherwise ) . because @xmath316 and @xmath58 we can fix @xmath167 so that @xmath317 .",
    "we would like to show that for @xmath310 the condition @xmath318 can not hold for large @xmath302 .",
    "one way to do this is to use that @xmath319 and apply the rellich - kondrashov lemma @xcite giving @xmath320 strongly . or we can use the argument similar to the one in @xcite . using the equation",
    "@xmath321 we get @xmath322 . substituting this into @xmath323 we obtain @xmath324 the operators @xmath325 and @xmath326 have square integrable kernels and are therefore compact .",

    "( [ nonsense ] ) can not hold for large @xmath302 , which proves ( a ) .",
    "part ( b ) easily follows if we prove that from @xmath327 follows @xmath328 in norm .",
    "indeed , for each @xmath59 there are bound states @xmath329 ( i = 1 ,  , m ) satisfying @xmath330",
    ". moreover @xmath331 and as @xmath332 the energies go to zero @xmath333 . in this case since @xmath334 there are @xmath67 bound states at the threshold , @xmath335 .",

    "let us define @xmath338 , then @xmath339 and we would like to show that @xmath340 . a proof by contradiction . if not then there must exist a constant @xmath341 and a subsequence ( for which we again reserve the same index @xmath302 ) such that @xmath342 . again because @xmath343 and @xmath344 we can fix @xmath167 so that @xmath345 .",
