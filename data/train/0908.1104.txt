    "wire media are structured materials formed by many conducting wires embedded in a host medium .",
    "the wires are normally considered to be very long compared to the wavelength in the host medium , but the diameter of the wires is only a small fraction of the lattice constant . the known analytical models of wire media @xcite treat them as crystals of infinitely long conducting cylinders . the cylinders may be arranged in different types of lattices resulting in different types of anisotropy of the wire crystals .",
    "it is known that wire media may exhibit strong spatial dispersion , so that the permittivity dyadic @xmath0 in such media depends on both frequency and wave vector .",
    "for instance , the permittivity dyadic of uniaxial wire medium with one set of thin ideally conducting wires oriented along @xmath1 reads @xcite = _t + ( 1 - k_p^2 k_0 ^ 2 - k_z^2)_z_0_z_0 , epsilon where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the permittivity and the permeability of the host medium , @xmath5 is the plasma wavenumber , @xmath6 is the wave vector component along @xmath1 , and @xmath7 is the unit dyadic in the plane orthogonal to  @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that the wire medium supports propagation of transverse electromagnetic modes ( tem ) which are basically the modes of a multi - wire transmission line.@xcite such modes propagate along the wires with the velocity equal to the speed of light in the host medium .",
    "the distribution of the microscopic @xmath8 and @xmath9 fields associated with the tem modes is static - like in the planes orthogonal to the wires , with the electric force lines emerging from and ending at the surfaces of the wires .",
    "it can be easily proven that there is electrical charge accumulated on the wires associated with these modes . in ref .",
    "it was shown ( for the uniaxial wire medium case ) that when this charge and the related potential are taken into account it is possible to obtain eq .   from simple quasi - static considerations similar to those used in ref .  .",
    "thus , it was shown that the strong spatial dispersion in wire media can be correctly described in a quasi - static approximation . in this paper",
    "we extend these considerations to a wide class of wire media , and propose an analytical model based on the effective inductance and capacitance per unit length of a wire .",
    "the other motivation for this study is the suppression of the nonlocal effects in wire media . in a recent paper by demetriadou _",
    "et al._@xcite the charge accumulated on the wires together with the rather small capacitance of thin wires were identified as the reasons for the spatial dispersion in wire mesh : a metamaterial formed by three sets of wires oriented along three cartesian coordinate axes and joined at the crossing points . a rigorous analytical model of such medium",
    "was developed in refs .  .",
    "the authors of ref .   make use of this model and full wave simulations to justify their main claims .",
    "they also propose certain ways how to decrease the spatial dispersion effects .",
    "the basic idea is to increase the capacitance of the wires by periodically loading them with metallic bodies or patches , or alternatively to increase the inductance per unit length by coating the wires with a magnetic material .",
    "somehow related to this work , it was shown in refs .",
    "that for a substrate formed by a wire medium slab capped with an array of patches ( the so - called mushroom substrate @xcite ) the response of the wire medium is essentially local . a different strategy to reduce the spatial dispersion was reported in ref .  , where it was shown that at infrared frequencies the plasmonic properties of metals may enable the design of artificial plasmas that mimic more closely a continuous local isotropic medium with negative permittivity .",
    "in this work , we generalize the theories reported in previous studies , @xcite and propose a quasi - static homogenization model that accurately characterizes the nonlocal dielectric function of a wide class of wire media ( both arrays of parallel wires , and arrays of connected wires ) , including the case where the wires are periodically loaded with conducting metallic bodies .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that our analytical theory models accurately the electric response of a uniaxial wire medium loaded with patches , and we discuss the physics of the suppression of spatial dispersion in such structures .",
    "we will start with the simplest possible case of the uniaxial wire medium with one set of wires oriented along the @xmath10-axis .",
    "we will follow the treatment presented in ref .  .",
    "we are interested in the longitudinal ( _ zz _ ) component of the permittivity dyadic . to get an expression for it in the quasi - static limit we assume that the radius of the wires @xmath11 and the distance between the wires ( the lattice period ) @xmath12 are much less than the wavelength in the medium .",
    "let us note that for the model we are going to develop the exact arrangement of the wires is not important , it is just enough to know the average distance between a pair of neighboring wires in a structure .",
    "denoting the average ( macroscopic ) electric field along @xmath10 axis in the medium by @xmath13 , one can write the following relation between this field component and the current in the wires  @xmath14 : e_z = ( jl + z_w ) i_z + z , main_uni where @xmath15 is the effective inductance per unit length of the wire , @xmath16 is the self - impedance of the wire per unit length which accounts for the finite conductivity of metallic wires at microwave frequencies or plasmonic behavior at optical frequencies , and @xmath17 is the additional potential due to charges on the wires .",
    "this relation can be obtained integrating the microscopic electric field over a path shown in fig .",
    "the path goes first along the surface of a wire then to the middle line in a pair of two neighboring wires , then along this middle line and , finally , back to the surface of the wire .",
    "the circulation of the microscopic electric field @xmath18 over this path reads @xmath19 the first integral in this relation represents the voltage drop along the surface of the wire and , therefore , can be expressed in terms of the wire current and the wire self - impedance per unit lenght .",
    "the second integral is the voltage drop along the symmetry line shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in the same manner as it was done in ref .",
    "we relate this voltage drop with the macroscopic electric field in the medium . after doing this",
    "the circulation of the electric field reads ( when @xmath20 is small enough ) circulation _ e_dl = ( z_wi_z - e_z)z + ( z + z ) - ( z ) , ( z ) = _ r_0^a/2e_x(x , z ) dx .",
    "the electric field circulation equals minus the time derivative of the magnetic flux that penetrates the area bounded by the integration path : @xmath21 , from which we immediately get when @xmath22 .    in general , the effective inductance @xmath15 depends on the specific microstructure of the system ( e.g. if the wires are coated or not with some material ) . in the particular case in which the wires are conducting cylinders ( with no material coating )",
    ", it was shown,@xcite by calculating the magnetic flux of a pair of neighboring wires in the quasi - static approximation , that @xmath15 verifies : l = _ 02 .",
    "inductanceit may be verified that the above formula also applies to the case where the wires are loaded with metallic patches ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , right ) .    the additional potential caused by the charges on the wires can be found by placing a linear charge density @xmath23 on the wires and by calculating the corresponding electrostatic potential @xmath17 created by the fluctuating part of the microscopic electric field .",
    "thus @xmath23 is responsible for the electric field component orthogonal to the wires .",
    "we introduce an effective capacitance @xmath24 per unit length , such that it verifies : ( z ) = ( z)c .",
    "defcapacitance notice that the considered capacitance is calculated by placing an @xmath25 linear charge density over the wires ( differently from the traditional definition of capacitance , which assumes that charge density over two conductors is antisymmetric ) . in the same manner as the inductance , the capacitance depends on the microstructure of the system . in the quasi - static limit",
    "a pair of charged wires ( with no attached conducting bodies ) induces the field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) e_x = 2_0 .",
    "this expression has the same form as the one used in ref .   for the quasi - static magnetic field of a pair of lines of current .",
    "therefore , for this particular case the capacitance is given by = 1 2_0 .",
    "capacitance the capacitance for a system of wires loaded with conducting patches ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , right ) is calculated in appendix a.    considering now a monochromatic plane wave of current excited in the crystal , the currents in the wires can be written in the form i_z(z ) = i_0 e^-j k_z z , and thus the linear density of the charge associated with the currents verifies ( z ) = -1j di_z(z)dz = k_zi_z(z ) .",
    "these charges are responsible for the electric field component orthogonal to the wires .",
    "hence , the relation can be rewritten in terms of the effective inductance and of the effective capacitance per unit length of the wire as e_z= ( jl + z_w + k_z^2jc)i_z .",
    "already in this expression one can identify the spatial dispersion term proportional to the square of the @xmath10-component of the wave vector .",
    "the macroscopic polarization current in wire media is the average of the currents in separate wires .",
    "let @xmath26 be the average area in the @xmath27 plane per one wire of the crystal .",
    "then the macroscopic polarization current is @xmath28 .",
    "the macroscopic displacement field is @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , after some algebra we find that the longitudinal component of the permittivity dyadic is given by = 1 - k_p^2k_0 ^ 2 - jk_0 - k_z^2 / n^2 , uniaxial_permittivity where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "it may be easily checked that the above formula reduces to eq .   in the case of perfectly conducting straight wires ( @xmath33 ) [ also , for unloaded wires @xmath34 as is seen from eqs .   and ] .",
    "more generally , when the wires are characterized by the complex permittivity @xmath35 ( e.g. , thin plasmonic rods at optical frequencies ) , the impedance @xmath16 is given by , z_w = , zwwhere @xmath11 is the radius of the rods .",
    "it may be easily verified that in this scenario eq .",
    "reduces to formula ( 16 ) of ref .  , which was calculated using a local field based approach .",
    "thus , eq . generalizes the previous homogenization models of the uniaxial wire medium .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth noting that the expression for the plasma wavenumber obtained in the present paper differs from the one derived in previous works .",
    "@xcite namely , under the approach developed above we have ( k_pa)^2 = 2 .",
    "myplasm in refs .",
    ", under a thin wire approximation , it was obtained that ( k_pa)^2 .",
    "belovplasm    one can notice that gives unphysical results for any @xmath36 .",
    "contrary , eq .",
    "gives a physically sound result in the limit @xmath37 when the surfaces of two wires touch : it predicts an infinite growth in the magnitude of @xmath5 in this limit . it can be also checked numerically that the accuracy of is better than when @xmath38 or larger , whereas the opposite behavior is observed for @xmath39 .",
    "nevertheless , both formulas have the same asymptotic behavior when @xmath40 . at @xmath41 (",
    "this ratio has been used in our numerical simulations that are discussed in section  [ supression ] ) the formulas and overestimate the plasma frequency by about 3% .    another asymptotic expression for the normalized plasma frequency which is often cited",
    "was obtained in refs .",
    "but even for rather small wire radii its accuracy is worse than that of and .",
    "also , it does not predict the infinite growth of @xmath5 when @xmath42 .",
    "it should be emphasized that eq .",
    "is in principle valid for a wide class of wire media ( e.g. wires with attached conducting bodies ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath15 depend on the specific microstructure of the system . the magnitude of the spatial dispersion term @xmath43 in can be reduced by increasing the value of @xmath44 .",
    "this quantity has the meaning of slow - wave factor for quasi - tem waves propagating along the wires . as mentioned before , for unloaded straight wires @xmath34 . as discussed in ref .",
    ", the capacitance @xmath24 can be increased by loading wires with metallic patches and the inductance @xmath15 can be increased by placing wires in ferromagnetic shields . an alternative way to increase",
    "the inductance is to use helices instead of straight wires .",
    "associated bi - anisotropy in helix medium can be compensated if both right- and left - handed helices are used .    attaching metallic or dielectric bodies to the wires",
    "also changes the transversal components of the permittivity dyadic .",
    "we will study this effect with more details in section  [ sect_uniax_supr ] .",
    "the ( 3d ) wire mesh is a wire crystal formed by three mutually orthogonal sets of wires joined at the intersection points .",
    "the electromagnetics of such metamaterial have been studied in several recent works .",
    "@xcite in the following derivation we assume a cubic lattice , but after a straightforward generalization the same method can be applied to structures of more complex geometries .",
    "similar to the case studied in section [ secwires ] , metallic or dielectric bodies may be attached to the wires .    in the wire mesh",
    "we get three components of the polarization current related with the currents in three orthogonal sets of wires .",
    "the currents in the wires are related to the average electric field in the medium in a manner similar to the uniaxial case : @xmath45 because the wires are joined at the crossing points they are locally under the same potential , that is why we have the same @xmath17 in all three equations .",
    "but the currents in three sets of wires can differ and that is taken into account by the variables @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath14 .",
    "let us consider a unit cell of the wire mesh with three intersecting connected wires .",
    "the total charge @xmath48 accumulated on these three wires per unit cell can be found as q = -a j(di_xdx + di_ydy + di_zdz ) . because the wires are electrically connected and their effective capacitance per unit length is the same , this charge is equally distributed among the three wires in the unit cell .",
    "therefore , for the linear charge densities on the wires we have in a vicinity of the unit cell _",
    "x = _ y = _ z = q3a = -1 3j(di_xdx + di_ydy + di_zdz ) . using the same notation for the effective capacitance of a wire as above we can write the potential @xmath17 as = -1 3jc(di_xdx + di_ydy + di_zdz ) = 13c(k_x i_x + k_y i_y + k_z i_z ) , where we have taken into account that the currents on the wires change on average as i_n = i_n^0 e^-jk_n n , n = x , y , z .",
    "now we can substitute this expression for the additional potential into .",
    "doing this we obtain the following system of equations : @xmath49 by introducing a vector of currents @xmath50 we rewrite this system in a more compact form using dyadics : = _ i , electric_field where @xmath51 is the unit dyadic and @xmath52 is the dyadic ( tensor ) product of two vectors . now it is only a matter of inverting the dyadic in brackets of to get the permittivity dyadic of the wire mesh .",
    "the average polarization in the medium is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 accounts for additional polarization due to finite thickness of the wires or metallic bodies attached to the wires . for a crystal of cubic symmetry we can write @xmath55 , therefore the displacement vector @xmath56 , and = _ t + 1j_0 a_cell^-1 , or , after some dyadic algebra , = ( _ t - k_p^2 k_0 ^ 2 - jk_0) - k_p^2_k_k 3n^2[k_0 ^ 2-jk_0][k_0 ^ 2-jk_0 - k^2/(3n^2 ) ] , where we use the same notations as in , and @xmath57 .",
    "the obtained permittivity dyadic can be also rewritten as = _ tr()( - _ k_kk^2)+ _ lo( , k)_k_kk^2 , where @xmath58    it can be verified that for the mesh of thin plasmonic rods without loading [ for which @xmath16 is given by eq . ] , the relations ",
    "transform to the ones presented in ref .   with the parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and identifying the numerical coefficient @xmath61 from the same reference with @xmath62 .",
    "recently@xcite it was proposed to load the wire mesh with metal patches to increase the effective capacitance of the wires per unit length and decrease the related spatial dispersion effects .",
    "this proposal was supported by numerical simulations . here , we will apply our general analytical model to the particular case of a uniaxial wire medium loaded with metal patches . for this purpose",
    "we just need to determine what is the effective capacitance @xmath24 introduced in section  [ uniaxial ] in the presence of patches .",
    "the details of calculation of this capacitance are described in appendix a. here we give the result : @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the wire capacitance given by and c_patch = 2_0wh ( ) , cpatch where @xmath65 is the width of the square patches periodically attached to the wires and separated by the distance @xmath66 along @xmath10 , and @xmath67 is the gap between two adjacent patches on a pair of neighboring wires .",
    "thus , the permittivity dyadic of the uniaxial wire medium loaded with patches is given by = _ t_t+(1 - k_p^2k_0 ^ 2 - jk_0 - k_z^2 / n^2)_z_0_z_0 , unipatchperm where we keep the same notations as in section  [ uniaxial ] .",
    "the transverse permittivity @xmath68 is mostly determined by the patches when @xmath69 and it can be found as the permittivity of a stack of capacitive grids separated by @xmath66 one from another . with the help of the known theory of such grids  @xcite it can be found that _",
    "t = 1 + 2wh ( ) .",
    "epst the accuracy of and is better for small gaps and for large values of @xmath70 .    in the limit @xmath71 the effective capacitance behaves as @xmath72 and , therefore , can be arbitrarily large if the gap between two adjacent patches is made small enough .",
    "on the other hand , the transverse permittivity @xmath68 grows under the same limit as @xmath73 .",
    "the square of the slow - wave factor @xmath74 is proportional to the effective capacitance , therefore , by increasing the width of the patches one can discard the spatial dispersion term in the right - hand side of while keeping @xmath68 at a reasonable level ( this is possible because @xmath68 grows more slowly when @xmath71 ) .",
    "an explicit expression for the slow - wave factor under the mentioned limit reads n^2 = lc_0_0 1 + 16 wh ( k_pd)^2 .",
    "in fact , we have numerically checked that this simple expression works quite well for gaps of width @xmath75 .    to illustrate the suppression of the spatial dispersion in the considered wire media",
    ", we have calculated the dispersion diagrams for several configurations using our quasi - static model , the transfer matrix method described in appendix b , and the eigenmode solver of cst microwave studio .",
    "the structure was assumed lossless in the simulations ( all metallic components are perfectly conducting so that @xmath33 ) .",
    "the transfer matrix formalism developed in appendix b is based on the assumption that in between two patch grids the electric field is a superposition of tem and tm modes .",
    "@xcite the fields on the interfaces of each patch grid are linked by a grid impedance and by an additional boundary condition,@xcite consistent with the formalism described in refs .  .",
    "the obtained results are presented in fig .",
    "[ model_vs_cst ] .    in fig .",
    "[ model_vs_cst](a ) and fig .",
    "[ model_vs_cst](c ) the dispersion diagrams obtained from the quasi - static model and the numerical simulations are shown for a set of the propagation angles with respect to the axis of the structure : @xmath76 [ for the other parameters of the structure refer to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; in these plots the wave vector is @xmath77 .",
    "the dispersion curves predicted by the quasi - static model are depicted with solid lines while the results of the numerical simulations are represented by symbols . in the example of fig .",
    "[ model_vs_cst](a ) the patch width has been set equal to @xmath78 , while in fig .",
    "[ model_vs_cst](c ) the patch width is @xmath79 . in both cases",
    "the theory and the simulations predict the existence of two dispersion branches associated with extraordinary waves , i.e. , with the quasi - tem and tm modes , as well as a dispersion branch associated with the ordinary ( te ) wave whose dispersion is not depicted in fig .",
    "[ model_vs_cst ] ( there are also other higher order modes at higher frequencies , but we are not interested in them ) .",
    "we call the high - frequency branch `` the plasmon mode '' because for @xmath80 this branch corresponds to the longitudinal plasmon - type wave propagating along the axis of the structure . on the other hand",
    ", the low - frequency branch for @xmath80 belongs to an ordinary transverse wave which is not affected by the wires ( but it is affected by the transverse permittivity @xmath68 of the medium ) .    from fig .",
    "[ model_vs_cst](a ) one can see that for the moderate - size patches the quasi - static model works surprisingly well even when @xmath81 approaches @xmath82 .",
    "the small difference in the frequencies of the plasmon - type modes predicted by the theory and the simulations at @xmath83 is due to the asymptotic nature of the formula for the plasma wavenumber that we use ( the discussion on this is given in section  [ uniaxial ] ) . for larger patches ( fig .",
    "[ model_vs_cst](c ) ) the quasi - static model does not predict appearance of a band gap at @xmath80 and @xmath84 .",
    "this is expected since in the model the capacitive loading on the wires is assumed to be effectively uniform along the wires .",
    "[ model_vs_cst](b ) and fig .",
    "[ model_vs_cst](d ) display the same dispersion diagrams but with the quasi - static model replaced by the transfer matrix model described in appendix b. one can see that this model wrongly predicts a completely flat dispersion for the plasmon mode propagating along the @xmath10 axis ( @xmath80 ) , independently of the patch size .",
    "this is in disagreement with the numerical simulations , as is seen from fig .",
    "[ model_vs_cst](b ) .",
    "indeed , the formalism developed in refs .",
    "is only valid when the gap between the patches is small , because otherwise other higher modes can be excited near the connections of the wires to the patch grid , and in such conditions it is not possible to consider that the microscopic field in the vicinity of the connection points are a superposition of tm and tem modes of the unloaded wire medium , as assumed in refs .  .",
    "consistent with this observation , it is seen in fig .",
    "[ model_vs_cst](d ) , that for larger patches and ( or ) larger angles of propagation the disagreement is less pronounced .",
    "another characteristic feature of the transfer matrix model is that it is able to predict the existence of the above - mentioned bandgap .",
    "this is because the transfer matrix model takes into account the granularity of the structure along the @xmath10 axis .",
    "the suppression of the spatial dispersion effects is evident if we compare fig .",
    "[ model_vs_cst](a ) with fig .",
    "[ model_vs_cst](c ) .",
    "indeed , the latter case corresponds to a larger patch width ( @xmath85 ) , and consequently the slope of the dispersion curve associated with the longitudinal mode ( the plasmon mode at @xmath86 ) is very small . to justify this effect and also to check the accuracy of the quasi - static model near the origin of the brillouin zone for a wide range of values of the gap , we have extracted the values of the slow wave factor @xmath87 from the results of the numerical simulations slightly above the point @xmath83 and compared them with the value of @xmath87 given by the analytical model .",
    "the results of this extraction are presented in fig .",

    "we see that despite its simplicity , the quasi - static model predicts very well the trend in the growth of @xmath74 when the the gap between the patches decreases .",
    "the agreement tends to improve for larger values of @xmath70 .",
    "in this paper we have developed a quasi - static analytical model of wire media applicable to a wide class of structures , and in particular we have considered uniaxial and isotropic wire crystals , which may be loaded with metallic patches . because the developed model is defined in simple physical terms of the effective inductance and capacitance per unit length of a wire it can be readily extended to other wire structures of more complex geometries .",
    "the model accounts for the finite conductivity of the wires so that it can be applied when the metallic wires become plasmonic ( consistent with the results reported in refs .  ) or when the wires are uniformly loaded with arbitrary complex impedances .",
    "in particular , we have studied with details the electrodynamics of uniaxial wire media loaded with patches , and demonstrated with full wave simulations that the proposed quasi - static model describes accurately the properties of the system in the long wavelength limit .",
    "consistent with the analysis of refs .",
    ", it was shown that the presence of the patches may result in a dramatic reduction of the nonlocal effects .",
    "for the case of unloaded wire media , we have demonstrated that the quasi - static model yields the same expressions for the dielectric permittivity tensors as those obtained by much more sophisticated methods.@xcite thus , we have proven that the strong spatial dispersion in wire media is a quasi - static effect .",
    "although this fact has already been noticed ,  @xcite the presented research extends the results obtained in ref .   and allows for analytical and quantitative studies of the possibilities to control the spatial dispersion in wire media .",

    "as is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right ) that depicts the path along which we calculate the circulation of the electric field , the capacitance in question can be calculated if we find the electric field in the region close to the gap between two patches on the neighboring wires . indeed , the circulation integral in the presence of patches has to be modified as follows @xmath88 where @xmath89 is at the location of an arbitrary plane of patches .",
    "we choose the integration path so that it first goes along the surfaces of the wire and the patch till the gap , then across the gap till the symmetry line ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , then along that line till the second gap and then across this gap back to the patch and the wire .",
    "one can see that the first integral in the right - hand side of   still represents the same quantity as in the unloaded uniaxial wire medium and is related to the finite conductivity of the wire .",
    "the integrals along the surfaces of the patches are not shown in as in the following we consider the patches to be ideally conducting .",

    "we see that the additional potential at the plane @xmath92 has to be ( z_0 ) = _ x(z_0 ) + _ z(z_0 ) .",
    "avphi    at this point it is worth reminding that the additional potential as we define it and use it in sections  [ uniaxial ] and [ mesh ] is essentially a macroscopic quantity : it changes slowly and smoothly along the wires .",
    "therefore , eq .   can be understood as the definition of the averaging procedure for the additional electric field ( represented by both non - uniform @xmath93 and @xmath94 components ) that appears because of the periodical non - uniformity in the charge distribution introduced by the patches .",
    "it is clear that for wide patches this additional potential is mainly determined by the fluctuating part of the microscopic field in the vicinity of the gap at @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "thus , to simplify the problem we may first neglect the effect of the charges sitting on the wires ( nevertheless , we will later add a correction term taking the wires into account ) .",
    "second , because @xmath97 depends only on the non - uniform part of the field we may neglect the effect of all other planes of charged patches except the plane @xmath96 .",
    "we may do so because when @xmath98 the field produced by the other planes of patches is practically uniform in the vicinity of the gap we are interested in . therefore in the following we consider only a single array of charged patches and discard all the patches that are not co - planar with the patch at @xmath96 .    in what follows",
