    "the activity in neuronal networks consists in one or more action potentials in a single neuron or an ensemble of neurons .",
    "the first case is typical for small networks , as some experimental systems _ in vitro _",
    ", where isolated spikes can be observed .",
    "the presence of a number of action potentials in an ensemble of neurons not always is a consequence of an external stimulus .",
    "neuronal systems exhibit an intense spontaneous activity , known since a long time , whose relation with the response to stimulation is not fully understood yet .",
    "it is however well established that spontaneous activity can not be simply reduced to a background noise uncorrelated to the system response .",
    "indeed , experimental results for the cat visual cortex ( @xcite ) have shown that the intensity of the response to an external stimulus is roughly proportional to the intensity of the spontaneous activity state of the system when the stimulus is applied .",
    "the variability in the response provided to the repeated application of the same stimulus is therefore caused by the different levels of ongoing activity .",
    "a similar analysis has been performed at the intracellular level on the same system , confirming that the spatio - temporal structure of the spontaneous activity influences the response signal ( @xcite ) .",
    "the typical form of spontaneous activity consists in the almost synchronous emission of action potentials in a large number of neurons , followed by periods of substantial inactivity .",
    "these high activity events , named bursts , are observed both during development and in mature systems and can last from a few to several hundreds milliseconds .",
    "conversely , the quiet periods can last seconds and have been attributed to a variety of mechanisms : the decrease in the available neurotransmitter ( @xcite ) ; the presence of an inhibitory factor leading to a disabilitation of the neurotransmitter release ( @xcite ) ; the inactivation , or remodulation of the response , of the glutamate receptors ( @xcite ) . an alternative form of temporal organization is slow oscillations between high activity and low activity states with a typical frequency of 0.3 - 1 hz . the temporal organization of this spontaneous activity has been characterized by the distribution of inter - times , i.e. the temporal intervals between successive bursts or successive spikes ( @xcite ) .    in 2003",
    "beggs and plenz have identified a novel form of spontaneous activity , neuronal avalanches ( @xcite ) .",
    "coronal slices of rat somatosensory cortex were placed onto a @xmath3 multielectrode array ( mea ) and spontaneous activity was induced by bath perfusion with the glutamate receptor agonist nmda in combination with a dopamine receptor agonist .",
    "the intrinsic activity of the system was monitored by measuring the potential at each electrode .",
    "this local field potential ( lfp ) integrates the electrical activity of neurons placed in the region surrounding the electrode : negative peaks in the lfp measure the influx of positive ions and therefore the cumulative membrane potential variation of the neurons in the region .",
    "experimental data show that before 6 days in vitro activity is mainly composed of sparse activations but during the second week simultaneous activations occur in several electrodes .",
    "the novel idea was to examine this electrophysiological signal on a finer temporal scale , which was able to evidence a complex spatio - temporal structure .",
    "indeed , activity starting at one electrode may involve more , non necessarily neighbouring , electrodes .",
    "binning time in cells of duration @xmath4 , allows to create a spatio - temporal grid reporting the active electrodes in each temporal cell .",
    "a neuronal avalanche is therefore defined as a sequence of successively active electrodes between two temporal bins with no activity .",
    "the total number of active electrodes , or alternatively the sum of all lfps , is defined as the size @xmath5 of an avalanche and the time interval with ongoing activity as its duration @xmath6 .",
    "the striking result is that both size and duration have no characteristic value , i.e. their distributions exhibit a power law behaviour .",
    "the analysis at a finer temporal scale is then able to enlighten the non synchronous character of the bursts .",
    "the exponents of these power law distributions depend on the choice for the temporal bin @xmath4 .",
    "indeed larger bins make active electrodes belonging to different avalanches to merge into the same larger event , leading to a smaller exponent . in order to identify the appropriate value of @xmath7",
    ", beggs and plenz verified that if @xmath4 is equal to the average value of the time delay between two successive lfps in the culture , the exponent does not depend any longer on the specific culture .",
    "they were then able to identify the universal scaling behaviour    @xmath8    the power law behaviour for the size distribution is followed by an exponential cutoff due to the finite size of the system , whereas for the duration distribution it extends over about one decade and the exponential cutoff sets in at about 10ms .",
    "the results _ in vitro _ have been confirmed by extended studies _ in vivo _ on anaesthetized rats during development ( @xcite ) and awake reshus monkeys ( @xcite ) .",
    "spontaneous neuronal activity recorded by mea placed in the rat cortical layer 2/3 at the beginning and the end of the second week postnatal , shows higher frequency ( up to 100hz ) oscillations nested into lower frequency ( 4 - 15hz ) oscillations . at the end of the first week postnatal , bursts start to organize into high frequency oscillations and become more synchronized during the second week .",
    "synchronous activity in the bursts exhibits the same scaling behaviour found for neuronal avalanches _ in vitro _ ( eq.s[ple ] ) .",
    "this similarity between _ in vitro _ and _ in vivo _ experiments support the idea that the emergence of nested oscillations reflects the development of layer 2/3 in the cortex .",
    "ongoing activity measured in the primary motor and premotor areas of two awake monkeys , sitting with no behavioural task , nor under particular stimulus , exhibits also neuronal avalanches .",
    "their organization is independent of the detection threshold and exhibits scale invariance .",
    "power laws for the size and duration distributions confirm the scaling behaviour in eq.[ple ] and suggest that in large neuronal networks a wide variety of avalanche sizes is possible , including clusters percolating throughout the system .",
    "this indicates that the largest cluster is solely controlled by the system size and not by the dynamics .",
    "this result also generalizes avalanche dynamics across species and different cortical areas .",
    "criticality can be therefore considered as a generic property of spontaneous cortical activity , which may indicate that networks with a larger response repertoire were selected over others throughout evolution .",
    "a flexible spontaneous activity could then underlie and optimize important cortical functions as learning and memory .",
    "the investigation on the spontaneous activity has been performed also for dissociated neurons from different networks as rat hippocampal neurons ( @xcite ) , rat embryos ( @xcite ) or leech ganglia ( @xcite ) .",
    "neurons are mechanically dissociated by trituration through fine - tipped pipettes and placed onto a mea , pre - coated with adhesion promoting molecules , in a nutrient medium . under fixed conditions of humidity and temperature ,",
    "neurons start to develop a network of synaptic connections and , after a variable period _ in vitro _ , exhibit spontaneous electrical activity .",
    "the electrodes of the mea in these experiments record the spikes , rather than the lfps , due to individual neurons attached to them . as a consequence ,",
    "the temporal scale for the data analysis has to take into account this difference in order to properly characterize the neuronal response . choosing the average inter - spike time at a single electrode as the temporal scale for data binning ,",
    "the spontaneous activity is monitored during the development and in mature cultures .",
    "different behaviours are observed . only those systems exhibiting a medium level of synchronization between random spikes and synchronized bursts",
    "exhibit critical behaviour .",
    "for those cultures the scaling behaviour is very robust and in agreement with eq.[ple ] .",
    "in particular , the emergence of a critical state has been found to be strongly related to the aging of the system , namely after the first few weeks _ in vitro _",
    ", where the behaviour of the system is subcritical , some cultures may self - organize and reach the critical state as they mature ( @xcite ) .    in real brain neurons",
    "are known to be able to develop an extremely high number of connections with other neurons , that is a single cell body may receive inputs from even a hundred thousand presynaptic neurons",
    ". one of the most fascinating questions is how an ensemble of living neurons self - organizes , developing connections to give origin to a highly complex system .",
    "the dynamics underlying this process might be driven both by the aim of realizing a well connected network leading to efficient information transmission , and the energetic cost of establishing very long connections .",
    "the morphological characterization of a neuronal network grown _ in vitro _ has been studied ( @xcite ) by monitoring the development of neurites in an ensemble of few hundred neurons from the frontal ganglion of adult locusts . after few days",
    "the cultured neurons have developed an elaborated network with hundreds of connections , whose morphology and topology has been analyzed by mapping it onto a connected graph .",
    "the short path length and the high clustering coefficient measured indicate that the network belongs to the category of small - world networks ( @xcite ) , interpolating between regular and random networks . in classical small - world networks",
    "the majority of sites have a number of connections close to the average value in the network .",
    "real neuronal networks behave quite differently , since neurons with quite diverse number of connections are observed .",
    "indeed , the properties of the functionality network have been measured experimentally in human adults ( @xcite ) .",
    "functional magnetic resonance imaging has shown that this network has universal scale free properties , namely it exhibits a distribution of out - going connection number , @xmath9 , which follows a power law , i.e. @xmath10 , independent of the different tasks performed by the patients .",
    "this behaviour suggests that in the network few neurons are highly connected and act as hubs with respect to information transmission .",
    "small world features have been also measured for functionality networks in healthy humans , whereas they are not present in patients affected by neurological diseases : alzheimer patients have longer path lengths ( as in regular networks ) ( @xcite ) whereas schizophrenic patients show a more random architecture of the underlying network ( @xcite ) .",
    "epileptic patients exhibit a more ordered neuronal network during seizures ( @xcite ) , whereas brain tumour patients a more random one ( @xcite ) .",
    "the first step to develop a model simulating neuronal dynamics is the choice of the specific network of connections .",
    "the simplest choice is a regular lattice , i.e. a square lattice for a two - dimensional system .",
    "however , following recent experimental results , we allow neurons to develop long range connections : starting from a regular lattice , a small fraction of bonds , from 0 to @xmath11 , is rewired , namely one of the two connected neurons is chosen at random in the system .",
    "this procedure originates long range connections and gives rise to a small world network ( @xcite ) , which more realistically reproduces the connections in the real brain .    in a small world networks",
    "the number of connections for different neurons is close to an average number . in order to reproduce the experimental data on the connectivity distribution in functionality networks ,",
    "we implement also scale free networks .",
    "more precisely , we set @xmath12 neurons at random positions in two - dimensional space and to each neuron we assign an out - going connectivity degree , @xmath9 , according to the distribution measured by fmri measurements of ongoing activity in humans ( @xcite ) .",
    "each neuron has a degree equal to a random number between @xmath13 and @xmath14 according to the probability distribution @xmath10 .",
    "the two neurons are chosen according to a distance dependent probability , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is their spatial distance ( @xcite ) .    in order to consider a network with both features , small - world and scale - free",
    ", we also implement the apollonian network .",
    "this has been recently introduced ( @xcite ) in a simple deterministic version starting from the problem of space - filling packing of spheres according to the ancient greek mathematician apollonius of perga . in its classical version",
    "the network associated to the packing gives a triangulation that physically corresponds to the force network of the sphere packing .",
    "one starts with the zero - th order triangle of corners @xmath17 , places a fourth site @xmath18 in the centre of the triangle and connects it to the three corners ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this operation will divide the original triangle in three smaller ones , having in common the central site .",
    "the iteration @xmath20 proceeds placing one more site in the centre of each small triangle and connecting it to the corners ( fig.1 ) . at each iteration @xmath21 , going from 0 to @xmath12 , the number of sites increases by a factor 3 and the coordination of each already existing site by a factor 2 .",
    "more precisely , at generation @xmath12 there are @xmath22 vertices , with connectivity degree @xmath23 respectively , where the two last values correspond to the site @xmath18 and the three corners @xmath17 .",
    "the maximum connectivity value then is the one of the very central site @xmath18 , @xmath24 , whereas the sites inserted at the @xmath12-th iteration will have the lowest connectivity 3 .    :",
    "iterations @xmath25 are symbols @xmath26 , respectively .",
    ", width=226 ]    the important property of the apollonian network is that it is scale - free .",
    "in fact , it has been shown ( @xcite ) that the discrete cumulative distribution of connectivity degrees @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the total number of sites at generation @xmath12 , can be fitted by a power law .",
    "more precisely , @xmath29 , with @xmath30 .",
    "moreover the network has small - world features .",
    "this implies ( @xcite ) that the average length of the shortest path @xmath31 behaves as in random networks and grows slower than any positive power of @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath32 . furthermore the clustering coefficient @xmath33 is very high as in regular networks ( @xmath34 ) and contrary to random networks . for the apollonian network @xmath33",
    "has been found to be equal to @xmath35 in the limit of large @xmath12 . on this basis",
    ", the apollonian network appears to have all the new features that we would like to investigate : small - world property found experimentally ( @xcite ) and possibility of a very high connectivity degree ( scale - free ) .",
    "moreover it also presents sites connecting bonds of all lengths .",
    "also this last feature can be found in real neuronal networks , where the length of an axon connecting the pre - synaptic with the post - synaptic neuron can vary over several orders of magnitude , from @xmath36s to @xmath37s . finally , most studies in the literature consider the case of a fully connected network , where each neuron is connected to every other neuron .",
    "even if not completely realistic , we consider also this last case .",
    "we here discuss a neuronal network model based on self - organized criticality ideas ( @xcite ) .",
    "the model implements several physiological properties of real neurons : a continuous membrane potential , firing at threshold , synaptic plasticity and pruning . in order to define the model we need to specify the behaviour of the single neuron under different conditions ,",
    "the dynamics then determines the system behaviour ( @xcite ) .",
    "we consider @xmath12 neurons at the nodes of the chosen network , characterized by their potential @xmath38 .",
    "the neuron positions will then be ordered in space for regular lattices and small world networks , organized in a hierarchical manner for the apollonian network and randomly chosen in two dimensions for the scale - free and fully connected networks .",
    "once the network of output connections is established , we identify the resulting degree of in - connections , @xmath39 , for each neuron @xmath40 . to each synaptic connection we assign an initial random strength @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , and to each neuron randomly either an excitatory or an inhibitory character , with a fraction @xmath43 of inhibitory synapses .",
    "whenever at time @xmath44 the value of the potential at a site @xmath45 is above a certain threshold @xmath46 , the neuron sends action potentials which arrive to each of the @xmath47 pre - synaptic buttons and lead to a total production of neurotransmitter proportional to @xmath38 . as a consequence ,",
    "the total charge that could enter into connected neurons is proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "each of them receives charge in proportion to the strength of the synapses @xmath41 v_j(t+1)=v_j(t ) [ prop ] where the sum is extended to all out - going connections of @xmath45 . in eq.(2 )",
    "the membrane potential variation is obtained by dividing the received charge by the surface of the soma of the post - synaptic neuron , proportional to the number of in - going terminals @xmath39 .",
    "the plus or minus sign in eq.(2 ) is for excitatory or inhibitory synapses , respectively . in regular networks neurons",
    "have the same number of ingoing and outgoing connections , therefore eq.(1 ) reduces to the simpler expression @xmath49 .",
    "the same consideration holds for small world networks .",
    "the firing rate of real neurons is limited by the refractory period , i.e. the brief period after the generation of an action potential during which a second action potential is difficult or impossible to elicit .",
    "the practical implication of refractory periods is that the action potential does not propagate back toward the initiation point and therefore is not allowed to reverberate between the cell body and the synapse . in our model , once a neuron fires , it remains quiescent for one time step and it is therefore unable to accept charge from firing neighbours .",
    "this ingredient indeed turns out to be crucial for a controlled functioning of our numerical model . in this way",
    "an avalanche of charges can propagate far from the input through the system .",
    "the initial values of the neuron potentials are uniformly distributed random numbers and the value of @xmath50 is fixed equal to 6 in all simulations . moreover , a small fraction ( @xmath51 ) of neurons is chosen to be output sites , i.e. an open boundary , with a zero fixed potential , playing the role of sinks for the charge .",
    "they model neurons connected to neurons not belonging to the slice and avoid that an excess to charge influx would lead to supercritical behaviour .",
    "each time neuronal activity stops in the network , an external stimulus is necessary to trigger further activity , which therefore mimics the nutrients from the bath needed to keep a real neuronal network alive .",
    "this stimulus consists in increasing the potential of a random neuron by a random quantity uniformly distributed between 0 and @xmath50 .    during the propagation of an avalanche according to eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we identify the bonds connecting two successively active neurons , namely neurons whose activity is correlated .",
    "the strength of their connections is increased proportionally to the activity of the synapse , namely the membrane potential variation of the post - synaptic neuron induced by the presynaptic neuron g_ij(t+1 ) = g_ij(t ) + i_ij(t ) where @xmath52 is the current through that synaptic connection and @xmath53 a dimensionless parameter .",
    "once an avalanche of firings comes to an end , the strength of all inactive synapses is reduced by the average strength increase per bond g = _ ij , t g_ij ( t)/ n_a where @xmath54 is the number of bonds active in the previous avalanche . here",
    "@xmath53 is the only parameter controlling both the strengthening and the weakening rule in the hebbian plasticity and represents the ensemble of all possible physiological factors influencing synaptic plasticity . by implementing these rules , our neuronal network `` memorizes '' the most used paths of discharge by increasing their strength , whereas the less solicited synapses slowly atrophy .",
    "indeed , once the strength of a bond is below an assigned small value @xmath55 , we remove it , i.e. set its strength equal to zero , which corresponds to the so - called pruning .",
    "+ 1 cm   as function of the number of external stimuli @xmath56 for a square lattice of linear size @xmath57 , equal initial conductances and different values of @xmath53 . in the inset",
    "we show the asymptotic value of the percentage of surviving bonds as function of @xmath53 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    we implement synaptic plasticity rules during a series of @xmath56 stimuli in order to modify the synaptic strengths , initially set at random . in this way",
    "we do not impose a strength configuration but let the system activity tune their values .",
    "once a percentage of bonds is pruned , we stop plastic adaptation and we perform our measurements , by applying a new sequence of stimuli without modifying the synaptic strengths .",
    "the extension of the plastic adaptation procedure then represents the level of experience , or _ age _ , of the system , whose response we monitor over a time - scale much shorter than the one needed for structural adaptation .",
    "all data presented in this manuscript are averaged over long temporal sequences in several initial network configurations .",
    "more precisely , for regular and small - world networks we average data on 10 different initial configurations with a sequence of 10000 avalanches per configuration . on the apollonian network we average over 100 different initial configurations and a sequence of 30000 avalanches per configuration . for scale free and fully connected networks we average over 60 different initial configurations and a sequence of 50000 stimulations per configuration .",
    "the total number of pruned bonds at the end of each avalanche , @xmath58 , in general depends on the initial conductance @xmath59 , therefore it is interesting to investigate the two cases of either all initial conductances equal to 0.25 , or being uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 .",
    "first the case of equal initial conductances is analysed .",
    "the strength of the parameter @xmath53 , controlling both the increase and decrease of synaptic strength , determines the plasticity dynamics in the network .",
    "this homeostatic mechanism implies that the more the system learns strengthening the used synapses , the more the unused connections will weaken . for large values of @xmath53 the system strengthens more intensively the synapses carrying current but also very rapidly prunes the less used connections , reaching after a short transient a plateau where it prunes very few bonds . on the contrary , for small values of @xmath53",
    "the system takes more time to initiate the pruning process and slowly reaches a plateau ( fig .",
    "2 ) . the inset of the figure shows the asymptotic value of the fraction of surviving bonds , calculated as the total number of bonds in the unpruned network minus the asymptotic number of pruned bonds , as function of @xmath53 .",
    "the number of unpruned bonds asymptotically reaches its largest value at the value @xmath60 for different networks .",
    "this could be interpreted as an optimal value for the system with respect to plastic adaptation .    for the apollonian network it is interesting to investigate if pruning acts in the same way on bonds created at different iterations @xmath61 , or rather tends to eliminate bonds of some particular iteration .",
    "the probability to prune bonds of different @xmath21 is evaluated , that is the number of pruned bonds over the total number of bonds for each iteration stage , as function of the number of applied stimuli .",
    "fig.3 shows that the plateau is reached at about the same value of @xmath56 and the shape of the curve is similar for each @xmath21 .",
    "however the probability to prune bonds with large @xmath21 is higher : these are the bonds created in the last iterations and therefore embedded in the interior of the network .",
    "this suggests that the most active bonds are the long range ones ( small @xmath21 ) , which therefore support most of the information transport through the network .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that , since the total number of bonds depends exponentially on @xmath21 , the gaps between the asymptotic values of the probability for successive generations depend exponentially on @xmath21 . in the inset of fig.3",
    "we show the asymptotic number of pruned bonds per generation on a semi - log scale , this quantity is well fitted by the exponential behaviour @xmath62 .",
    "the same analysis has been performed for random initial conductances between 0 and 1 .",
    "the results are similar to the previous case .",
    "it can be noticed that pruning starts already at @xmath63 , since conductances close to zero are present , and the plateau is reached after about 1000 stimuli .",
    "the value of @xmath53 which now optimizes the number of active bonds is about 0.030 also for the apollonian network . in this case , the pruning behaviour for different iterations is similar to the previous case , with the pruning probability exponentially increasing with @xmath21 , as @xmath62 .",
    "the effect of pruning on the connectivity degree of the network is an interesting quantity to monitor on scale free networks .",
    "on apollonian networks we evaluate the number of sites with a number of outgoing connections @xmath9 as function of @xmath9 in the initial network and after application of a given number of external stimuli ( fig.4 ) . after the application of few external stimuli , i.e. for a short plastic adaptation",

    "the power spectrum is calculated as the squared amplitude of the time fourier transform as function of frequency , averaged over many initial configurations .",
    "because of the definition of the numerical time unit , the frequency unit does not correspond to the experimental one in hertz .",
    "fig.8 shows the spectrum for different networks and different values of @xmath56 .",

    "i.e. without plasticity adaptation , the spectrum has a @xmath83 behaviour , characteristic of soc . for values of @xmath56 different from zero , but before the @xmath58 plateau , one can distinguish two different regimes : a power law behaviour with exponent @xmath84 at high frequency , followed by a crossover toward white noise at low frequency . the difference between @xmath85 for @xmath74 and @xmath86 for higher @xmath56 , suggests that plasticity reduces the relevance of small frequencies in the power spectrum , in better agreement with experimental eeg spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "the stability of the exponent with respect to @xmath53 has also been verified , finding consistently @xmath84 at high frequency .",
    "the stability of the spectrum exponent suggests that an universal scaling characterizes a large class of brain models and physiological signal spectra for brain controlled activities .",
    "medical studies of eeg focus on subtle details of a power spectrum ( e.g. shift in peaks ) to discern between various pathologies .",
    "these detailed structures however live on a background power law spectrum that shows universally an exponent of about 0.8 , as measured for instance in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a similar exponent was also detected in the spectral analysis of the stride - to - stride fluctuations in the normal human gait which can directly be related to neurological activity ( @xcite ) .",

    "several experimental evidences suggest that the brain behaves as a system acting at a critical point .",
    "this statement implies that the collective behaviour of the network is more complex than the functioning of the single components .",

    "the threshold dynamics ensures time scale separation ( slow external drive and fast internal relaxation ) .",
    "this dynamics leads to criticality and therefore power law behaviour ( @xcite ) .",
    "the model belongs to the class of non - conservative models , since output neurons can drive charge outside the system .",

    "the plastic rules introduce a homeostatic regulatory mechanism between excitation and inhibition leading to critical behaviour .",
    "the ensemble of these new ingredients is at the origin of the measured exponents , different from the typical exponents found in soc models .",
    "ii is interesting to notice that in fully connected networks the excess of very large avalanches hampers the synaptic depression mechanisms and therefore alters the self - organized regulation between excitation and inhibition . as a consequence , supercritical behaviour is observed .",

    "the first result is that an optimal value of the plasticity strength @xmath53 exists with respect to the pruning process , optimizing information transmission .",

    "moreover the avalanche size and duration distributions exhibit a power law behaviour with stable exponents compatible with the values experimentally found for neuronal avalanches .",
    "these values appear to be independent of the model parameters and the specific connectivity network .",

    "solely the fully connected networks consistently exhibit supercritical behaviour due to the high connectivity level which sustains large avalanche activity .",
