    "the study of nonlinear phenomena in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of cold atomic gases has become a subject of immense interest , both from theoretical and experimental perspectives @xcite .",
    "confining magnetic traps and/or optical lattices provide controllable externally applied potentials for a dilute bec and appear as a linear term in the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation governing the statics and dynamics of the order parameter .",
    "further , the interatomic interactions lead to an atomic density dependent nonlinear term within the gp framework .",
    "the strength of this nonlinear term can be controlled by varying the scattering length via magnetic @xcite or optical @xcite feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "one intriguing aspect of cold atomic gases confined in optical lattices is the competition between the linear terms coming from the optical lattice and the nonlinear terms @xcite that allows for solitonic solutions @xcite , loop structures in the energy bands @xcite , period doubling @xcite , etc . , and also gives rise to dynamical instabilities @xcite . along this research direction , recently another interesting possibility has opened up where one may imagine having no linear periodic component at all ( apart from the kinetic energy ) in the gp equation but instead introducing periodicity in the system via a spatially periodic nonlinearity .",
    "such a system is termed as a `` nonlinear lattice '' @xcite . here",
    "both the nonlinearity and the periodicity are generated by a single term .",
    "experimentally it has been realized with optical feshbach resonances , by means of pulsed optical standing waves @xcite .",
    "a bec with a spatially modulated interaction within a mean - field approximation is well described by the gp equation in one dimension ( 1d ) : @xmath0 which is valid when the average number of particles per site is much larger than unity , and density and temperature are sufficiently low so that the normal component is negligible . here",
    "the nonlinear term comprises a constant and a periodically modulated component .",
    "it is assumed that both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are positive quantities that can be controlled experimentally .",
    "@xmath3 is connected to the period @xmath4 of the modulation by @xmath5 and it , in fact , is the wave number of the laser beam for the optical feshbach resonance .",
    "@xmath6 is the mass of bosons and @xmath7 is the condensate wave function . in a recent work ,",
    "the band structure and stability of this system were studied @xcite , considering the bloch wave solutions for the lowest - energy bands .",
    "we study the same system but go beyond the usual bloch states ( we call them period-1 solutions ) that have the same periodicity as that of the modulated interaction .",
    "it is known that for becs in a periodic potential , in addition to the conventional bloch states , stationary states with periods twice , or even higher multiples of the lattice period emerge as well @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these higher period states are shown to be energetically and dynamically stable in other systems like becs with dipole - dipole interactions in optical lattices @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "for the case of periodically modulated interaction , we explore the possibility of having period - doubled stationary states ( termed as period-2 solutions ) .",
    "moreover we make a comparison between the stability regions of period-1 @xcite and period-2 energy bands .",
    "we find that while the stability of the period-1 solutions can be qualitatively explained in terms of the overall averaged interaction as described in earlier studies @xcite , the stability of period-2 solutions demands for a more careful study of the dynamics of the system .",
    "we show that , in the period-2 case , becs localized at each cell are more isolated and such isolation can stabilize the dynamics of the system , giving the central result of this paper : attraction - induced dynamical stability .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we first consider a simplified version of the system , where the uniform component of interaction is set to zero ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , and map it in a discrete model @xcite .",
    "this is analogous to an optical lattice in 1d .",
    "we reduce the system with a spatially periodic interaction in the continuum representation to a discrete representation by sampling just two points per period of the interaction ( the maxima and minima of the interaction ) .",
    "thus in this discrete model , the spacing between two sites is given by @xmath10 with the period of the interaction ( i.e. , the period of the original nonlinear lattice ) @xmath11 .",
    "in this representation , the on - site interaction parameter alternates between @xmath12 and @xmath13 at the adjacent sites . to obtain periodic solutions , we can define a `` supercell '' that consists of two sites , with the lattice constant @xmath4 .",

    "we have come across a number of striking features while studying the dynamical stabilities both from the discrete and the continuum models .",
    "here we recall some of them :    \\1 ) the period-1 and period-2 states in the lowest energy band are always unstable at @xmath79 for purely sinusoidal modulations with @xmath8 . these can , however , be stable for larger @xmath44 values .",
    "\\2 ) in the discrete model with @xmath124 , the period-2 solutions are more dynamically stable than their period-1 counterparts .",
    "\\3 ) in the continuum model the period-2 solutions show greater dynamical stability ( compared to the period-1 cases ) up to a certain value of @xmath105 , but beyond it they become completely unstable .",
    "in this section we try to explain these features from a physical point of view , and also investigate situations with a non - zero @xmath1 ( i.e. , a constant component added to the periodic modulation ) to obtain a better understanding of the stability mechanism .",
    "the first feature is in complete contrast with becs in periodic potentials where the @xmath79 state is always dynamically stable . in @xcite , the dynamical instability of the period-1 bloch state at @xmath79 for this model with @xmath8",
    "was explained in terms of the averaged interaction energy , and it was argued that if the averaged interaction @xmath125 over one period becomes negative , that would make the @xmath79 state unstable . in the case of @xmath8 ( i.e. , @xmath108 ) , since the interaction energy ( for both period-1 and period-2 solutions ) averaged over one supercell is always negative for @xmath79 , it resembles a bec with attractive interparticle interaction , which is unstable dynamically @xcite .",
    "interestingly , although the lowest bloch states are dynamically unstable at @xmath79 , at larger values of @xmath44 these can be stable [ e.g. , the gray - shaded regions in figs .",
    "[ d_dynp1](a ) , [ d_dynp2](a ) , [ c_dynp1](a ) , and [ c_dynp2](b ) ] . to explain this seemingly counterintuitive result",
    ", we go back to the population density distributions of the discrete model in figs .  [ p1den ] , [ p2den1 ] , and [ p2den2 ] .",
    "as we have already mentioned , at the zone edge the majority of particles are accumulated in the attractive sites , leaving the repulsive sites nearly empty .",
    "now , for a two - site cell , the transition amplitude between the states with populations @xmath126 and @xmath127 can be estimated as @xmath128 .",
    "having alternate empty sites means that the tunneling between neighboring sites is frozen , and the dynamical instability is suppressed .",
    "this `` freezing '' takes place for the four - site cell in the case of the period-2 solutions as well .",
    "in contrast , at the zone center with @xmath79 , the population distribution is more even , and no sites are vacant .",
    "the tunneling is non - negligible , and the suppression of dynamical instability does not work around this point .",
    "since the isolation of the higher - density regions , which is responsible for the stability of the superfluid at higher @xmath44 values , is a result of the attractive interaction in alternate sites , this mechanism can be termed as `` attraction - induced dynamical stability . ''    that the period-2 solutions are more stable than the period-1 solutions at higher @xmath12 values is a direct consequence of the very same mechanism . for period-2 solutions , the higher - density regions are more localized and isolated , i.e. , most of the particles are hosted by every fourth site while , for period-1 solutions , it is every second site . in the case of period-1 solutions ,",
    "this particular stability mechanism is not very prominent near the zone center because the higher - density regions are not separated enough , and a larger @xmath12 [ fig .  [ d_dynp1](a ) ] generates more instability than a smaller @xmath12 [ fig .",
    "[ d_dynp1](b ) ] for the same value of @xmath44 . on the other hand , for period-2 solutions , a larger",
    "@xmath12 enhances the stability that was already there due to a higher degree of isolation between the higher - density regions .",
    "thus , the superfluid with a higher @xmath129 value [ fig .",
    "[ d_dynp2](a ) ] is more stable than its lower-@xmath129 counterpart [ fig .",
    "[ d_dynp2](b ) ] for period-2 solutions .",
    "of course , there are other factors that determine the dynamical stability , apart from the sign of the net attractive interaction energy , and the suppression of the tunneling due to isolation of higher - density regions . when @xmath25 is sufficiently small , we observe that a dynamically unstable region appears near the zone edge .",
    "this suggests that there are several other factors , too , collectively responsible for the complicated stability diagram like figs .",
    "[ d_dynp1](b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning here that , similarly , in also becs in optical lattices with dipole - dipole interactions , it is observed that higher period solutions are more stable @xcite .",
    "this attractive - interaction induced dynamical stability is present in the continuum model as well .",
    "only , now the attractive and repulsive `` sites '' are not actual discrete lattice sites any more , but domains .",
    "we observe that up to a certain value of @xmath105 , increasing the strength of the attractive interaction enhances the stability of the period-2 states around the zone edge by suppressing the inter - site tunneling ( fig .  [ c_dynp2 ] ) .",
    "however , if the nonlinear interaction term is increased even beyond this point ( @xmath130 here ) , another mechanism becomes important : the interaction between intra - site particles .",
    "then an increased attractive interaction leads to the collapse of the bec within a supercell . since in the discrete model",
    "this kind of intra - site degrees of freedom is completely absent , we did not have something equivalent to fig .",
    "[ c_dynp2](a ) there .",
    "we also note that for higher values of @xmath105 ( fig .",
    "[ c_den ] ) the density distribution has very sharp peaks . as the value of @xmath105",
    "is gradually decreased , those peaks broaden .",
    "this is another reason why the discrete model fails to mimic the continuum one for high @xmath105 : the expansion of the sharp peaks needs more number of basis functions , and the single - band discrete model is insufficient to capture the actual behavior .    for the excited states ,",
    "too , there is a departure from the prediction based on the averaged interaction .",
    "the period-1 and period-2 states in higher bands usually correspond to an average positive interaction energy , and yet we find the @xmath79 state to be dynamically unstable when @xmath108 .",
    "next we consider adding a constant component to the periodic modulation , i.e. , taking @xmath131 in the continuum model .",
    "although the @xmath79 state in the lowest band is always dynamically unstable for @xmath108 , by gradually increasing @xmath106 one finally arrives at a critical value that stabilizes the system . in fig .",
    "[ avint ] , the solid curve gives the values of the critical @xmath106 s as @xmath105 is increased .",
    "the yellow region bounded by the solid line is dynamically stable , and the white one is dynamically unstable .",
    "the dashed line marks the separation between average attractive interaction and average repulsive interaction , i.e. , the region below it is attractive and the region above is repulsive .",
    "so there is a correspondence between the overall interaction being repulsive , and the system being dynamically stable for period-1 solutions at @xmath79 [ fig .",
    "[ avint](a ) ] .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ avint](b ) , we plot the same for @xmath132 ( i.e. , the zone boundary for period-1 states ) . here , too , there appears to be a relation between the region of dynamical stability and the line where the averaged interaction changes sign .",
    "only , now the solid line lies below the dashed line and the dynamically stable region expands .",
    "this can be connected to the `` attractive - interaction induced dynamical stability '' again : near the zone edge there is an additional stability mechanism due to the isolation of the higher - density regions .",
    "thus the system becomes stable even at a @xmath106 value that is slightly lower than the @xmath106 required to make the net interaction repulsive .    , ( b ) period-1 and @xmath132 , and ( c ) period-2 and @xmath107 .",

    "the solid line separates the dynamically stable and the unstable regions , and the stable region is shaded in yellow.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the picture , however , changes for period-2 solutions .",
    "when @xmath105 is very low , the period-2 branch does not extend up to @xmath79 , but rather appears only in a small region around the zone boundary .",
    "for a higher value of @xmath105 , even though the period-2 branch exists for @xmath79 , it is dynamically unstable for @xmath108 . if we keep on increasing @xmath106 , the instability increases .",
    "thus , there is no critical @xmath106 and no stable @xmath79 state for this parameter domain , although the averaged interaction can be both attractive and repulsive , depending on the choices of @xmath106 and @xmath105 .    for period-2 and @xmath107 ( the zone boundary for period-2 states ) ,",
    "the trend is completely opposite to the period-1 results . for @xmath133 ,",
    "the solutions are dynamically stable even at @xmath108 , and gradually become dynamically unstable if @xmath106 is increased above a certain value [ fig .",
    "[ avint](c ) ] .",
    "thus , we have a critical value of @xmath106 that marks the onset of dynamical instability .",
    "below @xmath134 , the solutions are dynamically unstable at @xmath108 , and increasing @xmath106 makes it even more unstable .",
    "so unlike the period-1 cases , here the dynamically stable region ( the region below the solid line , and not above , marked by yellow shading ) does not correspond to an overall repulsive interaction [ fig .",
    "[ avint](c ) ] .     and @xmath107 with @xmath108 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath135 ( solid curve ) .",
    "the dashed curve belongs to the stable region and the solid one marks the onset of dynamical instability . here",
    "@xmath109 is plotted in units of @xmath84 , @xmath110 is in units of the average density @xmath88 . ]    in period-1 situations , the sign of the overall interaction matters in determining the dynamical stability : a repulsive interaction means a dynamically stable bec .",
    "since the `` attraction - induced dynamical stability '' is not the dominant behavior there ( because the higher - density regions are not separated enough ) , the stability can more or less be accounted for by the sign of the net interaction alone . for period-2 solutions , however , a more complicated factor sets in . since the period-2 case in general represents a higher degree of isolation between the higher - density regions ( fig",
    "[ c_den ] ) , the tunneling rate here plays a crucial role . for a large @xmath105 ,",
    "the peaks are sharper .",
    "the inter - site tunneling is suppressed here and the system is more stable . as @xmath105 is decreased , the peaks spread out to overlap , enabling more tunneling of particles , and that leads to dynamical instability .",
    "that is why in fig .",
    "[ avint](c ) , the stability region appears in the higher @xmath105 side below the solid line . that the shape of the peaks and the nature of their separation in the density distribution determines the dynamical stability",
    "can be illustrated from fig .",
    "[ twopeaks ] as well .",
    "the dashed curve of fig .  [ twopeaks ] corresponds to the density distribution at @xmath107 for @xmath136 and @xmath108 , that falls in the stable region of fig .",
    "[ avint](c ) .",
    "if @xmath106 is increased above @xmath137 , although the averaged interaction is now positive ( and we could thus expect a stable bec ) , we find the region dynamically unstable . here",
    "the density distribution shows wider peaks ( the solid curve ) and a lesser degree of isolation , and this results in more tunneling of particles , and hence , less stability .",
    "so we see that the attractive - interaction induced dynamical stability is the key factor in describing the stability of period-2 states around the zone edge .",
    "finally , in a realistic experiment one may anticipate that a harmonic external trapping potential is present in addition to the periodic modulation .",
    "in such a trapped case , key modifications would be in the density of states in the low - energy region and the emergence of the quantum pressure due to the inhomogeneity of the system .",
    "however , they are relevant only to the long - wavelength perturbations while the fastest growing mode for the dynamical instability in our discussion is the one with a short wavelength of the order of a lattice constant . therefore , provided the oscillator length of the trap is much larger than the lattice constant , the dynamical stability of the nonlinear lattice in the presence of the harmonic trap could be reliably predicted within the local - density approximation using our results for the untrapped case .",
    "we have studied becs in a nonlinear lattice , i.e. , with a spatially periodic scattering length that can be realized via optical feshbach resonances .",
    "periodic and period - doubled solutions are obtained , both for a reduced discrete model and the full continuum model .",
    "the energetic and dynamic stabilities of these stationary states are then examined .",
    "it is observed that the periodic nature of the interaction leads to a splitting of the bec : most of the particles are stored in the attractive sites or domains .",
    "if these higher - density regions are not sufficiently isolated and an inter - site tunneling is significant , then the dynamical stability of the superfluid can be qualitatively explained by the sign of the averaged interaction : a net repulsive bec is stable and a net attractive one is unstable .",
    "however , when the higher - density regions are well separated , the inter - site tunneling is suppressed and that enhances the dynamical stability of the system . this `` attraction - induced dynamical stability '' plays the dominant role near the zone edge for periodic solutions . also , it is this mechanism that renders the higher - periodic solutions more dynamically stable when the nonlinear interaction term is strong enough , unless there is an inter - site dynamics causing a collapse of the bec .",

    "<S> we study multiple - period bloch states of a bose - einstein condensate with spatially periodic interactomic interaction . solving the gross - pitaevskii equation for the continuum model , and also using a simplified discrete version of it , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the energy - band structures and the corresponding stability properties . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a new `` attraction - induced dynamical stability '' mechanism caused by the localization of the density distribution in the attractive domains of the system and the isolation of these higher - density regions . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the superfluid stable near the zone boundary , and also enhances the stability of higher - periodic states if the nonlinear interaction strength is sufficiently high . </S>"
