    "a precision measurement of the @xmath8 for the muon at bnl is expected to test the electroweak ( ew ) sector of the standard model ( sm ) and at the same time to shed light on possible effects of  new physics \" . after a release of the new e821 result @xcite , based on the @xmath9 data collected in the year 2000 , a current mean of experimental results for @xmath5 is ( @xcite : @xmath10 with an uncertainty ( in parentheses ) that is almost two times smaller than in the previous measurement @xcite , and only two times larger than the ultimate goal of the e821 experiment .",
    "the standard model prediction for @xmath4 consists of the qed , ew and hadronic contributions : @xmath11 the qed contribution , which constitutes the bulk of the sm contributions , is calculated up to four loops and the @xmath12 term is estimated @xcite ; its uncertainty is very small @xmath1 @xmath13 .",
    "the ew contribution , based on one- and two - loop diagrams , is also known to a similar accuracy [ 48 ] the ew contribution is small ( 152 @xmath14 ) and is only about two times larger than the present experimental uncertainty ( see ( 1 ) ) .",
    "the hadronic contribution , @xmath1 7000 @xmath15 , is the second largest contribution to @xmath16 .",
    "it is known at present with an accuracy of 1 % .",
    "this uncertainty is the main source of the uncertainty in the sm prediction .",
    "predictions for the hadronic contribution [ 9 - 21 ] differ among themselves , however , these differences seem to be much less significant than , say , one year ago ( see discussions in [ 11,12,17 - 21 ] , and also in @xcite ) .",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath17 , as well as one of the dominant errors in its value , come from the leading vacuum - polarization ( vp1 ) term .",
    "some preliminary results of the improved calculations of the vp1 have been presented recently @xcite .",
    "these are data - driven analyses using the most recent data on hadron production in @xmath18 collisions from bes , cmd-2 , snd @xcite .",
    "the corresponding uncertainties for the vp1 , @xmath19 , are now even smaller than those obtained previously by using the data on @xmath20 decays in addition to the then available @xmath18 data , see @xcite .",
    "another important issue has been the hadronic contribution to the light - by - light ( lbl ) scattering , and its contribution to @xmath5 . after a sign error ,",
    "first pointed out in @xcite , was found in the earlier calculations of this contribution , a few re - evaluations @xcite of this part have appeared during the last few months .",
    "all of them confirm the finding of @xcite , a positive sign of the lbl contribution .",
    "the central value for the lbl varies from 80 to @xmath21 , depending on the analysis .",
    "since this contribution can be estimated only on a purely theoretical ground , it has a sizeable uncertainty of the order of @xmath22 @xcite ( or maybe even larger , as discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "the latest sm predictions and the present world average of the experimental result ( 1 ) differ by @xmath1 3@xmath2 ( a theoretical and experimental error combined in quadrature ) , if preliminary results of the evaluation of the vp1 contribution from @xcite are used together with the estimation for the lbl given in @xcite .",
    "the significant progress in the reduction of the error on the experimental side and the stabilization of the sm prediction of @xmath17 makes it essential for the possible implications of the @xmath5 results to be reanalysed .",
    "the issue of whether this is a signal of supersymmetry is already being addressed @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the implication of the latest @xmath5 results for the light - higgs boson scenarios in the non - supersymmetric , cp - conserving two - higgs - doublet - model ( 2hdm ) in its version called `` model ii '' ; this is a continuation of earlier studies @xcite .    in sec .",
    "2 we collect some results based on the recent calculations of @xmath16 . as a reference for the vp1 contribution we take the @xmath18 data - driven analysis done by jegerlehner @xcite , fj02 , where the new cmd-2 results were used . the difference between the experimental data and the sm prediction , @xmath23 , can be used to derive stringent constraints on the parameters of models , which give additional contribution(s ) to @xmath4 .",
    "we calculate the interval @xmath3 , which can then be used to constrain any such contribution , at 95% cl . in sec .",
    "3 we introduce the 2hdm(ii ) , which we wish to constrain using this interval , and discuss briefly the existing constraints . in sec .",
    "4 we derive the 95% cl limits on the parameters of this model , using @xmath3 .",
    "section 5 contains the combined constraints , while the conclusions and outlook are given in sec .",
    "the 95% cl interval @xmath3 thus obtained is positive , and hence it leads to an _ allowed positive _ contribution ( _ an allowed band _ ) . at the same time it also leads to the _ exclusion _ of any negative contribution to the @xmath4 .",
    "note that the additional positive contribution to @xmath4 can be up to a few times larger than the ew one .",
    "using results for the vp1 contribution obtained by the hmnt group @xcite , from their `` exclusive '' analysis , the values we get for @xmath16 , @xmath29 and @xmath3 , are numerically very close to those obtained above , using the fj02 analysis . keeping all the other contributions as before , but with the hmnt(ex ) results for the vp1 term @xcite , we get , in units of @xmath30 , a_()= 297.0 ( 107.2 ) 87.2 a _ 507.4 , while their `` inclusive '' analysis leads to a more stringent constraint , namely a_()= 357.2 ( 106.4 ) 148.7 a _ 565.7 .",
    "note that the above 95% cl intervals are positive for both the hmnt results , just as in the fj02 case .",
    "also note that the relative differences between the upper bounds in all three analyses are small ( below 10% ) .",
    "however , the use of hmnt `` inclusive '' analysis leads to a lower bound , which is relatively much higher ( up to 70% ) than in the fj02 and hmnt(ex ) cases .",
    "the other recently published sm predictions @xcite , to which the bnl paper @xcite refers , were obtained from analyses of the vp1 contribution based on the older , often not very precise @xmath18 data . to improve the accuracy of the estimation of the vp1 part",
    ", @xmath31 decay data were included in addition in those analyses .",
    "however , predictions obtained there for @xmath16 and for @xmath32 are not very different from these new preliminary results used by us .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the following trend is observed ( see discussion in @xcite ) : if one uses the @xmath31-decay data in the calculation of vp1 , then its estimation for the value of vp1 increases while that for the uncertainty decreases .",
    "on the other hand , the preliminary fj02 and hmnt analyses of the vp1 contribution , the ones used here , rely solely on the low - energy data for the @xmath18 collisions .",
    "the accuracy of these analyses increases significantly with respect to the earlier analyses of the same kind thanks to an inclusion of new , high - precision measurements @xcite and the use of more refined theoretical methods .",
    "moreover , the central value for the vp1 contribution did not increase in these new analyses .",
    "thus , the preliminary analyses by fj02 and hmnt lead to a deviation from the experimental value for the muon @xmath33 larger than the published results mentioned above , which differ by `` only '' 1.6 to 2.6 @xmath2 , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "let us conclude this general part by the following comment .",
    "it becomes clear that already at present there is a need of a coherent and a comprehensive error analysis for all components contributing to the calculation of @xmath34 .",
    "it will be even more nessesary in a near future , when the bnl experiment will reach the planned accuracy . since an estimate combining all the different contributions does not exist for @xmath16 , and hence for @xmath27 , which is needed for estimating the effects of new physics , is not available at the moment , a simplified error analysis , as presented in this section , is unavoidable .",
    "this is sufficient for a rough estimation of new effects ; however , to reach a final conclusion , better error analyses are necessary .",
    "the non - supersymmetric , cp - conserving 2hdm ( `` model ii '' ) @xcite based on two doublets of complex , scalar - fields @xmath35,@xmath36 .",
    "this is a simple extension of the sm , in which only the higgs sector is enlarged . to avoid possible large effects due to the flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcnc )",
    ", the 2hdm potential can be chosen in a @xmath37-symmetric form , without ( @xmath35,@xmath36 ) mixing . in the general case , the potential can have terms , characterized by a mass parameter @xmath38 , which break the @xmath37 symmetry softly ; see @xcite .",
    "the 2hdm has five higgs particles : two neutral higgs scalars @xmath39 and @xmath40 , one neutral pseudoscalar @xmath41 , and a pair of charged higgses @xmath42 .",
    "their masses are free parameters of the model .",
    "other parameters are : the angle @xmath43 , which describes the mixing in the neutral higgs - scalar sector ; @xmath6 the ratio of two vacuum expectation values of scalar doublets , @xmath44 ; and the parameter @xmath38 .",
    "small values of @xmath38 seem to be more natural from the point of view of the fcnc effects @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that for such a case , a non - decoupling of the heavy higgs sector can be realized @xcite .    in the",
    "2hdm one can choose the yukawa couplings in a few different ways .",
    "here we consider the model  ( ii ) implementation , where one doublet of fundamental scalar fields couples to the @xmath45-type quarks , and the other to the @xmath46-type quarks and charged leptons .",
    "this way fcnc processes are avoided at the tree level @xcite .",
    "this higgs sector is identical to the one in the mssm ; however , in the 2hdm ( ii ) considered by us , there are no tree - level relations between parameters as in the mssm case . therefore even for very heavy supersymmetric particles , the 2hdm ( ii ) and mssm have very different phenomenology .    to be more specific , let us consider the ratios of the direct coupling constants of the higgs boson @xmath39 or @xmath40 to the massive gauge bosons @xmath47 or @xmath48 , as well as to the fermions _",
    "(  yukawa couplings ) _ for the @xmath45-type quarks and @xmath49-type quarks and the charged leptons , to the corresponding couplings for the sm .",
    "they are determined in terms of angles @xmath43 and @xmath50 @xcite . for @xmath51 ( and",
    "similarly for @xmath40 ) we have , in a form suitable for a simultaneous discussion of @xmath39 and @xmath40 : @xmath52 here we have @xmath53 .",
    "observe a _ pattern relation _ between these couplings ( for @xmath39 or @xmath40 ) : @xmath54 , or @xmath55 , found in @xcite .    for @xmath56 all couplings of @xmath39",
    "have the sm values , the couplings of @xmath40 to gauge bosons are equal to zero , while one of the couplings of @xmath40 to fermions may differ considerably from the corresponding sm one , for a small or large @xmath6 . if @xmath57 then the @xmath40-boson has sm couplings , while @xmath39 has very different properties : @xmath58 and the yukawa coupling @xmath59 can be large , for large values of @xmath6 .",
    "this is a case that may correspond to a light - scalar scenario discussed below .",
    "the yukawa coupling @xmath60 , relevant to a higgs boson coupling to a muon , plays a basic role in the calculation of the 2hdm contribution to @xmath4 .",
    "it is equal ( up to a factor @xmath61 ) to @xmath6 for a pseudoscalar and @xmath62 .",
    "if in addition @xmath63 , then the same holds for a scalar @xmath39 ; more precisely then @xmath64 ( see eq . ( 7 ) ) . in the calculation of the two - loop contribution to @xmath4 , the coupling of @xmath62 to a scalar @xmath39",
    "is involved as well , and it is given by _",
    "h^+^h=(1-)_v^h+(_d^h+_u^h ) , with the same normalization as that for an elementary charged scalar particle in the sm .",
    "for @xmath58 one gets @xmath65 .",
    "we see that this coupling depends on the parameter @xmath38 . in this paper",
    "we consider only the case with @xmath66 .",
    "a more general case will be studied elsewhere .",
    "many searches for a light higgs particle in the 2hdm ( ii ) were performed at various energies and machines ; the most systematic studies were performed at lep . all existing lep data , see for instance @xcite , allows for the existence of _ one _ light neutral higgs boson , @xmath39 or @xmath41 , with a mass even below 20 gev . according to the results presented in the left panel of fig .",
    "1 , the other higgs particle ( @xmath41 or @xmath39 , respectively ) should be heavy enough to avoid the exclusion region in the ( @xmath67 ) plane , given roughly by @xmath68 gev .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of the sm higgs boson , which should be heavier than 114.4 gev ( 95% cl ) .",
    "also the mssm higgs particles should be heavier than @xmath1 90 gev @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the bjorken process leads to an upper limit on the coupling of @xmath39 to the gauge boson @xmath69 .",
    "this limit , obtained at 95% cl , is presented in the right panel of fig .",
    "we see that this coupling is much smaller than 1 for @xmath70 50 gev .",
    "the yukawa couplings @xmath60 of a very light scalar or of a very light pseudoscalar , with mass below 10 gev , are constrained in the form of upper limits by the low - energy data @xcite , whereas lep experiments @xcite do that for for masses @xmath71 4 gev ( see figs . 4 , 5 ) .",
    "it is only the analysis of the decay @xmath72 at lep @xcite that gives both the upper and lower limits for @xmath73 .",
    "note that @xmath73 is equal to @xmath6 for @xmath41 and , if @xmath58 , also for @xmath39 .",
    "the constraints from the @xmath74 process , mentioned above , have been measured by a few groups @xcite .",
    "we present their results in fig .",
    "4 ( lines denoted by k , n and l ) . unfortunately ,",
    "the corresponding predictions have large experimental and theoretical uncertainties , the latter ones both being due to the qcd and relativistic corrections .",
    "nevertheless , as we will see below , the constraints coming from this process , even when accounting for some additional uncertainties , play an important role in closing a low mass window for the scalar @xmath39 .    finally , note that in the 2hdm there is an important lower limit on the mass of @xmath62 , coming from the nlo analysis of the @xmath75 data , given by @xmath76 gev at 95% cl @xcite .",
    "we apply the @xmath3 , obtained in sec . 2 , to constrain parameters of the 2hdm ( ii ) ( see also earlier papers @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the lightest higgs boson , @xmath39 or @xmath41 , dominates the full 2hdm ( ii ) contribution , @xmath77 we have @xmath78 , or @xmath79 ( _ a simple approach _ in @xcite ) .",
    "this approach should hold for masses below 50 gev , according to results presented in the left panel of fig .",
    "1 . for higher masses , which are also considered here ,",
    "this is essentially equivalent to assuming a large mass gap between the lightest one , @xmath39 or @xmath41 , and the remaining higgs bosons , which lead to a light-@xmath39 or a light-@xmath41 scenario .",
    "the relevant one- and two - loop diagrams , studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , are shown in fig . 2 for the @xmath39 and @xmath41 contributions . +    ( 300,80)(0,0 ) ( 30,90)[r]@xmath80 ( 45,30)[r]@xmath81 ( 0,5)[r]@xmath38 ( 82,5)[r]@xmath38 ( 40,90)(40,70)33 ( 0,0)(40,70 ) ( 40,70)(70,0 ) ( 25,40)(50,40)5     +    ( 200,100)(-150,-110 ) ( 30,90)[r]@xmath80 ( 80,30)[r]@xmath80 ( 10,30)[r]@xmath81 ( -3,5)[r]@xmath38 ( 90,5)[r]@xmath38 ( 65,60)[l]@xmath82 ( 40,90)(40,70)33 ( 60,40)(70,20)33 ( 0,0)(10,20 ) ( 10,20)(70,20 ) ( 70,20)(80,0 ) ( 40,50)(20,2,1 ) ( 10,20)(20,40)5     + -3.cm    according to the lep limits , discussed in sec . 3.2 , we assume that @xmath39 does not couple to @xmath83 , and therefore we neglect the @xmath84-loop in the light-@xmath39 scenario .",
    "we include , however , an @xmath62-loop with @xmath85 equal to 400 , 800 gev ( and for @xmath66 ) .    in fig .",
    "3 we present the contributions to @xmath4 obtained for an @xmath39 ( solid lines ) and for a @xmath41 ( dashed lines ) , assuming yukawa couplings @xmath60 equal to 1 . for both @xmath39 and @xmath41 ,",
    "the one - loop @xcite and two - loop @xcite results are shown separately . for the purpose of comparison , a one - loop @xmath62 contribution is presented .",
    "the one - loop diagram gives a positive contribution to @xmath4 for a scalar , whereas it is negative for a pseudoscalar , independently of the value of the higgs - boson mass .",
    "the signs of the two - loop contributions are reversed , these diagrams contribute negatively ( positively ) for a @xmath39 ( @xmath41 ) case @xcite",
    ". these two - loop diagrams can give large contributions , since they allow us to avoid one small yukawa coupling with a muon in favor of a coupling with other , potentially heavy , particles circulating in the loop @xcite .",
    "indeed , the contributions of two - loop diagrams dominate over the corresponding one - loop ones when the mass of @xmath39 or @xmath41 is above a few gev , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . as a result ,",
    "in the two - loop analysis , based on a sum of the one- and two - loop ( fermionic and bosonic ) contributions , a positive ( negative ) contribution can be ascribed to a scalar @xmath39 with mass below ( above ) 5 gev or a pseudoscalar @xmath41 with mass above ( below ) 3 gev .    in our calculation ,",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath79 contain contributions proportional either to @xmath87 , equivalently to @xmath88 for @xmath41 and for @xmath39 ( if @xmath58 ) , or to @xmath89 .",
    "assuming @xmath90 for a light-@xmath39 scenario , and @xmath91 for a light-@xmath41 one , and using the estimate of the interval @xmath3 from table 2 , we can derive constraints on @xmath6 , for @xmath39 and @xmath41 .",
    "they are , as expected , in the form of allowed regions ( the area between thick lines in fig .",
    "4 ) for masses below 5 gev for @xmath39 , shown in the left panel of fig . 4 , and for masses above 3 gev for @xmath41 , the right panel of fig .",
    "4 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the 95% cl constraints from the @xmath5 are presented in fig .",
    "4 ( area between thick lines in the left and right panels ) together with current upper limits from lep , from the yukawa processes @xcite ( see aleph , delphi and opal results ) . also the lower limits from the @xmath92 @xcite can be seen in fig .",
    "4 . in addition",
    ", the upper 90% cl limits from the @xmath93 decay ( lines denoted k , n and l , with the k results rescaled by a factor 2 , as discussed in @xcite ) and from the tevatron @xcite , are presented as well .",
    "we see that our two - loop analysis , based on the latest @xmath5 data and on the fj02 estimation of @xmath17 ( vp1 ) , if combined with constraints from other experiments , allows for the existence , in the 2hdm ( ii ) , of a pseudoscalar with mass between @xmath1 25 gev and 70 gev , and @xmath6 above @xmath1 25 .",
    "the mass region for @xmath41 allowed by @xmath5 data , between @xmath1 3 and 25 gev , is excluded by the constraints from lep , based on opal and delphi data . on the other hand the constraints from the tevatron close the pseudoscalar - mass window above 70 gev . for a light scalar the combined constraints are even more severe ; if the old constraints from the @xmath93 decay data are taken into account , the area allowed by the latest @xmath5 data disappears .",
    "note that the exclusion of a light @xmath39 is in agreement with the conclusion of the theoretical analysis reported in @xcite .",
    "using the latest precise measurement of the @xmath5 and comparing it with the improved , theoretical estimations of the sm contribution , we derive the 95% cl @xmath3 interval to be used to constrain an additional contribution to @xmath4 , beyond the sm ones .",
    "it allows one to constrain strongly the additional contribution , which arises in a cp - conserving , non - supersymmetric 2hdm ( ii ) for a small parameter @xmath38 , studied in this paper .",
    "the additional contribution , allowed at 95% cl , has to have a positive sign , and can lead to a clear prediction for a light - scalar and a light - pseudoscalar scenario in the model considered here .",
    "these two scenarios correspond to the case when one of the higgs bosons , @xmath39 or @xmath41 , is very light , much lighter than the other higgs particles of the model .",
    "it should be further noted that both of these scenarios are in agreement with existing data from other experiments .",
    "an exchange of such light particle dominates in the one- and two - loop contributions to the @xmath4 .",
    "constraints from @xmath5 are such that they exclude a light @xmath39 with a mass above 5 gev and a light @xmath41 if its mass is below 3 gev , as the corresponding contributions are negative in these regions .    our two - loop analysis presented in this paper is based on the newest @xmath5 data and on the ( preliminary ) fj02 estimation of @xmath17 . combining the constraints from the @xmath5 data with those from other experiments , a pseudoscalar with mass between @xmath1 25  gev and 70",
    "gev and @xmath7 is allowed . however",
    ", a light scalar is excluded .",
    "the main results will hold also if the @xmath8 constraints are based on the hmnt results for the vp1 . for the hmnt(in )",
    "case the window for a pseudoscalar will be even smaller : @xmath94 gev and @xmath6 between 40 and 120 .",
    "the results will not change significantly , if the uncertainty for the lbl contribution is up two times larger than in the estimation we used in the analysis .",
    "if such an error is still added in quadrature , then the lower bounds go down , with respect to results given in fig .",
    "4 , by a factor @xmath1 1.4 . there will be no visible changes in the upper bounds .",
