    "the generally accepted scenario for the formation of the moon involves the oblique impact of a roughly mars - sized object with the proto - earth @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of such an impact , using primarily smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) methods , have shown that the impactor is destroyed ( either during the impact , or via post - impact tidal disruption ) , and that a circumterrestrial disk is formed that contains up to @xmath5 of iron - depleted material @xcite .",
    "the silicate disk is initially a mixture of vapor and melt , containing @xmath6 vapor by mass @xcite .",
    "typically about @xmath7 to @xmath8 of the disk material is predicted to have initial orbits exterior to the roche limit for lunar density material , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the earth s radius .",
    "prior works have used direct n - body simulations to model the accumulation of the moon from such an impact - generated disk , describing the disk with @xmath12 to @xmath13 particles that are each of order @xmath14 in radius @xcite .",
    "the n - body models depict an extremely rapid disk evolution , with material interior to the roche limit spreading outward on a timescale of order 1 month .",
    "typically a single massive moon accretes in a year or less at an average distance of @xmath15 @xcite . that a particulate protolunar disk would spread so rapidly was anticipated by earlier estimates of @xcite , who pointed out that a disk of particles containing sufficient mass to produce the moon would be prone to gravitational instability and local clumping .",
    "exterior to the roche limit , instability - produced clumps would form permanent aggregates and seed the growth of the moon . but interior to the roche limit",
    ", such clumps are continually sheared apart by planetary tidal forces , and this process generates a large viscosity that drives a @xmath16 lunar mass roche - interior disk of particles to spread in less than a year @xcite ( see section [ subsubsection_instability_vicosity ] . both processes can be seen directly in the n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "n - body protolunar disk models assume a disk of condensed particles , neglecting the presence and creation of vapor as the disk evolves .",
    "this is probably a reasonable approximation for material orbiting outside the roche limit . immediately after the impact",
    ", disk material is primarily in a condensed state @xcite . outside the roche limit ,",
    "collisions between orbiting particles lead to accretional growth . a rough estimate of the heat liberated by accreting the moon is its gravitational binding energy , which implies an energy released per unit mass of the moon of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the moon s mass and radius . even in the limit that all of this energy is retained by the moon , the expected extent of vapor production as the moon accretes is small because @xmath21 is much smaller than the latent heat of vaporization of silicate , @xmath22 .",
    "however , there is an inherent inconsistency in describing the roche - interior disk with an n - body particulate model .",
    "an approximately lunar mass disk of condensates ( solid or melt ) interior to the roche limit will be subject to the instability - induced viscosity described above .",
    "such a disk spreads so rapidly and the viscously generated heat is so large that the disk would likely substantially vaporize as it evolves @xcite , invalidating the model s assumption of a particulate disk",
    ". a vapor disk would be gravitationally stable , and therefore not be subject to the instability - induced viscosity seen in the n - body simulations .",
    "@xcite were the first to recognize this important point , and proposed that the protolunar disk would instead evolve in a two - phase , vertically mixed vapor - melt state , with a viscous dissipation rate regulated by the rate at which a @xmath23 silicate vapor photosphere could cool .",
    "this thermally regulated viscosity implies a much longer disk spreading timescale of @xmath0 @xcite ( see section [ subsubsection_thermal_viscosity ] ) .",
    "recently @xcite has derived an analytical description for the vertical structure of a two - phase protolunar disk inside the roche limit , including both the vertically well - mixed case explored by @xcite , in which the vapor mass fraction is very low , and a new alternative class of solutions in which the vapor initially contains the majority of the disk s initial mass .",
    "the latter implies a stratified disk structure , in which a portion of the disk s mass settles to the mid - plane as melt and undergoes rapid viscous spreading , while the remainder of the disk is contained in a gravitationally stable vapor atmosphere .",
    "the vapor component of the disk requires @xmath0 to deplete itself through condensation , and material is ultimately supplied to the roche exterior region over this timescale . thus both the well - mixed and stratified disk models imply a similarly protracted timescale for the inner disk s overall evolution that is @xmath0 .",
    "we here develop a new lunar accretion model that describes the roche - interior region as a fluid disk , while material outside the roche limit is tracked using direct n - body simulation .",
    "the inner disk evolves viscously and interacts with outer bodies through resonant torques at the strongest lindblad resonances .",
    "material from the inner disk that viscously spreads beyond the roche limit accretes to form new moonlets that are added to the n - body simulation , while inner disk material spreading onto the earth is removed from the disk .",
    "this hybrid construct allows us to model a slowly evolving inner disk that spreads in @xmath0 as suggested by thermodynamical models @xcite , while also directly simulating the rapid accretion expected among condensed material orbiting outside the roche limit .",
    "our overall objective is a more physically motivated model of the moon s accretion , and improved estimates of its formation timescale and initial orbital position .",
    "these quantities are related to several outstanding issues , including the moon s initial thermal state , the potential for chemical equilibration between the protolunar disk and the earth prior to the moon s accumulation @xcite , and the initial disk mass and angular momentum required to produce a lunar mass moon . in section 2 we describe in detail our numerical model . in section 3",
    "we use our code to reproduce results from pure n - body simulations by @xcite . in section 4",
    "we perform hybrid model simulations with an inner fluid disk , and study the influence of the disk s initial parameters .",
    "results are then discussed in section 5 .",
    "our numerical model is built around the symplectic integrator symba @xcite .",
    "we have paired it with a simple analytical model for a roche - interior fluid disk that evolves under the influence of viscous spreading and resonant torques due to interactions with orbiting objects at their @xmath24 order lindblad resonances .",
    "the inner disk mass decreases as material spreads onto the planet or outward beyond the roche limit ; mass spreading beyond the roche limit is assumed to accrete into new moonlets that are then added to the n - body code .",
    "we assume that the inner disk has a uniform surface density @xmath25 and viscosity @xmath26 with radius .",
    "the inner disk s evolution is computed by estimating the rate of change of its edges due to the viscous and resonant torques .",
    "these simplified inner disk treatments are detailed in appendix [ appendix_disk_mass ] and [ appendix_resonances ] .",
    "we characterize the inner disk by a single , time - dependent viscosity that is a function of the disk s surface density @xmath27 .",
    "we envision a silicate disk that is initially two - phase ( vapor / melt ) , and we assume that both components co - evolve . we adopt the argument of @xcite that the inner disk s viscosity will be limited by the rate at which a @xmath23 disk photosphere can radiatively cool , so long as there is vapor present . once the disk mass and the associated rate of viscous dissipation is low enough that all of the vapor can condense , we assume that the inner disk s viscosity will be comparable to that of a purely condensate disk subject to local gravitational instabilities @xcite .      for a @xmath16 lunar mass , roche - interior disk composed of melt or solids , local patch instabilities strongly increase the collision rate among disk particles through the formation of clumps that are continuously sheared apart by planetary tides @xcite . by introducing coherent particle motions ,",
    "instabilities modify the transport of angular momentum in the disk and produce a characteristic viscosity @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath27 is the disk surface density , and @xmath29 is orbital frequency .",
    "this process and the resulting rate of angular momentum transport are observed in n - body numerical simulations of the protolunar disk @xcite and dense planetary rings @xcite .",
    "the associated disk spreading timescale for a disk of radial scale @xmath30 , @xmath31 , is then @xmath32    the dissipation rate per unit area is @xmath33 ( @xmath34 denotes the time derivative of @xmath35 ) , implying a total energy per area dissipated as the disk spreads for a time @xmath36 of @xmath37 . for a uniform surface density disk , this represents a total liberated energy per unit disk mass of @xmath38 .",
    "the estimated energy released as an @xmath16 lunar mass disk spreads is thus comparable to the latent heat of vaporization for silicate ( @xmath39 ) . if the inner disk spreads in @xmath40 as implied by equation ( [ tau_wc ] ) , it is probable that it will retain any viscously dissipated heat , because the timescale for the disk to radiatively cool from its surfaces is much longer , of order decades @xcite .",
    "this implies that a substantial fraction of a condensate disk would vaporize as it spreads due to an instability - induced viscosity .",
    "while a condensate disk would be subject to instabilities , a typical silicate vapor disk is gravitationally stable .",
    "indeed , its toomre parameter is @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the disk s temperature and @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the adiabatic index , @xmath45 is the universal gas constant and @xmath46 is the molecular weight .",
    "thus , a protolunar disk composed of silicate vapor with a photosphere temperature near the condensation point @xmath47 would have @xmath48 , and would not be subject to the instability - induced viscosity .    in the absence of strong dissipation , a vapor disk could cool and condense , with gravitational instabilities",
    "then re - developing in the condensed phase .",
    "this in turn would heat the disk through increased dissipation .",
    "this feedback suggests that the dissipation rate in the inner disk will be limited by the rate at which the disk can radiatively cool from its surfaces @xcite , with @xmath49 and an associated viscosity @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath52 is the disk s photospheric temperature .",
    "the corresponding spreading timescale is @xmath53      [ section_model_used ] following the @xcite disk model in which the liquid and vapor phases remain vertically well - mixed , our model assumes that both the vapor and condensed phases viscously evolve as a single unit . at each time step in our simulation , we compute both the instability - induced viscosity @xmath54 and the radiation - limited viscosity @xmath55 ( with @xmath56 ) at @xmath57 . if @xmath58 , we assume that the disk self - regulates to a radiation - limited viscosity and set @xmath59 .",
    "if @xmath60 , the disk can lose energy via radiative cooling at a faster rate than it is generated by instabilities .",
    "at this point we assume the disk would condense , and therefore set @xmath61 .",
    "the ratio between the two viscosities is @xmath62 for reference , a uniform one lunar mass disk extending from @xmath11 to @xmath9 has a surface density of @xmath63 .",
    "our initial disks have @xmath64 and evolve with a radiation - limited viscosity . as the disk spreads and loses mass , its surface density decreases , and since @xmath65 , at some point @xmath66 .",
    "this transition occurs for @xmath67 this is equivalent to an inner disk mass of @xmath68 for a uniform surface density between @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we assume that the inner disk maintains a uniform surface density with radius as it viscously expands .",
    "viscous expansion leads to mass transfer from the disk onto the planet , and to the outward expansion of the disk s outer edge ( see appendix [ appendix_disk_mass ] for details ) .      [ section_spawning ] as disk material viscously spreads outward beyond the roche limit",
    ", accretion becomes increasingly probable and the continuous nature of the disk is disrupted as discrete large objects form ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our model approximates this transition by removing mass from the inner disk and adding new moonlets to the n - body simulation once the disk s outer edge expands beyond the roche limit .",
    "once @xmath71 , we compute the characteristic fragment mass that would form from local gravitational instability , and assume that since it is at or beyond the roche limit , it will be stable and not be tidally disrupted .",
    "this mass , and its corresponding angular momentum , is removed from the inner disk and added to the n - body code as a new discrete particle .",
    "the mass @xmath72 of the fragment that would form from instabilities is @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 is on the order of , but less than , unity .",
    "we set @xmath75 .",
    "if the disk s outer edge is at the roche limit @xmath76 , then inner disks containing @xmath77 and @xmath78 will form fragments of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "this is comparable to the aggregate mass seen in the direct `` rubble pile '' n - body simulations of @xcite . to improve computational efficiency , we set the minimal mass of spawned fragments to @xmath81 .",
    "smaller fragments would be formed by an inner disk containing @xmath82 .",
    "as we will later see , this only affects the very last stages of a given simulation , so we expect it to be of little influence on the outcome of a given simulation .",
    "we test the influence of this parameter in section [ section_model_limitations ] .    at each time step",
    ", we check whether the disk s outer edge lies beyond the roche limit .",
    "when this occurs , we compute the mass of a spawned fragment per the equation above as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "the mass of the spawned moonlet is removed from the inner disk . to conserve angular momentum , we first set the new body s semi - major axis to @xmath83 , and then we compute the new disk s outer edge @xmath84 so that @xmath85 , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the inner disk s angular momentum before and after adding the new body , and @xmath88 is the added fragment s angular momentum .",
    "additional details are in appendix [ appendix_spawning ] .",
    "we include resonant interactions between the disk and the growing moonlets , which lead to a positive torque on the exterior moonlets ( whose orbits expand ) , and a negative torque on the inner disk ( whose outer edge contracts ) .",
    "such interactions are important because , e.g. , sufficiently massive moonlets can initially confine the disk edge within the roche limit and delay the spawning of additional moonlets @xcite .    as a first approximation",
    ", we consider only the strongest @xmath24 order inner lindblad resonances , in which the ratio of the mean motion at a location in the disk to that of an exterior moonlet is a ratio of integers with @xmath89 . to compute the resonant torque",
    ", we use the formalism of @xcite .",
    "the total torque @xmath90 exerted by the inner disk on an exterior satellite per unit satellite mass is found by summing the torques due to all the @xmath24 order resonances that fall in the disk ( see appendix [ appendix_resonances ] ) ,    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the satellite s mass , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 is the highest @xmath96 for which resonance @xmath97 falls in the disk .",
    "when @xmath98 , the satellite is far enough from the disk that its 2:1 resonance ( which is the most distant @xmath24 order resonance ) is no longer in the disk , and in this case @xmath99 . for a satellite orbiting close to the disk",
    ", we impose an upper limit on @xmath95 by considering only those resonances that are radially separated from the satellite s orbit by a distance greater than the satellite s hill radius ( @xmath100 ) , or those resonances for which @xmath101 .",
    "this excludes from the torque calculation the approximate region immediately surrounding the satellite s semi - major axis within which particles undergo horseshoe orbits .    to compute the resulting orbital evolution of the satellite",
    "we adopt the approach of @xcite .",
    "we define an orbital migration timescale , @xmath102 , due to the torque on the satellite associated with all of its @xmath24 order resonances that fall in the disk , @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the satellite s orbital angular momentum .",
    "we then apply an additional acceleration to the satellite , given by @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the satellite s velocity .",
    "we include this as an additional `` kick '' of duration @xmath107 ( where @xmath108 is the timestep ) at the beginning and end of each step in the n - body code .",
    "the total torque on the disk due to @xmath109 orbiting moonlets is @xmath110 .",
    "we assume that moonlet torques cause a change in the disk s outer edge @xmath83 , with @xmath111 ( see appendix [ appendix_resonances ] ) because external moons remove angular momentum from the disk .      beyond the roche limit , we model the protolunar disk material by a collection of individual particles , with an initial power - law size distribution @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the number of particles with a mass between @xmath96 and @xmath114 . in this section",
    "we describe our treatments of collisions between particles , and the tidal disruption of moonlets scattered close to the earth .",
    "in the default version of symba , all collisions result in inelastic mergers .",
    "however this is too simplified for objects orbiting near the roche limit .",
    "we modified the code to include tidal accretion criteria @xcite , which near the roche limit are a function of the impact energy , the mass ratio of the colliding objects , and the collision location relative to the roche limit .",
    "we use either an `` angle - averaged '' criterion , that assumes randomly oriented collisions , and a `` total accretion '' criterion , in which collisions are assumed to occur in the radial direction along the widest axis of the hill sphere .",
    "these are the same accretion criteria as those used in @xcite , and in some of the simulations in @xcite .",
    "additional details can be found in appendix [ appendix_tidal_accretion ] .    while an improvement over the assumption of perfect mergers during every collision , our tidal accretion criteria are still idealized .",
    "they ignore the potential for fragmentation or substantial deformation when calculating whether a given collision results in accretion , and assume that an accreted pair merges into a new spherical body . @xcite",
    "considered three different accretion models : the two described above , and a rubble pile model , in which individual n - body particles are never merged but allowed to form gravitationally bound aggregates of irregular shapes that can , e.g. , be tidally disrupted when they pass within the roche limit .",
    "@xcite find similar overall outcomes for all three treatments ( e.g. , their figure 1 ) ; this is probably because the moon s final position is affected more by its resonant interactions with the inner disk in their simulations than the exact position at which it begins to grow , so long as the latter is outside the roche limit .",
    "we use the angle - averaged criterion for direct comparison with ida et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in our section 3 simulations , and the total accretion criterion in our hybrid simulations in section 4 .",
    "close encounters between particles can lead to some of them being scattered toward the planet on high eccentricity orbits , where they may suffer tidal disruption and be effectively absorbed by the inner disk .",
    "we expect objects accreting in the outer disk to be molten or partially molten ( e.g. , section [ section_physical_state ] ) .",
    "an inviscid fluid object on a parabolic orbit will tidally disrupt in a single pass if its pericenter distance q satisfies @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the mass of the disrupting body and @xmath117 is the density of the orbiting body @xcite .",
    "for the earth - moon system , this yields @xmath118 .    at each time step , we compute the distance of each object to the primary .",
    "if this distance is smaller than @xmath119 , we remove the body from the n - body code and add its mass and angular momentum to that of the inner disk .",
    "the latter is done by finding the disk s new outer edge @xmath84 so that @xmath120 , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the disk s angular momentum before and after capture , and @xmath121 is the angular momentum of the captured body .",
    "the disk mass after capture is @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the mass of the captured body .",
    "this yields @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the disk s inner edge ( see appendix [ appendix_disk_mass ] for details ) , and @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the captured body s semi - major axis and eccentricity .",
    "we solve this numerically so that angular momentum is conserved to a @xmath128 precision .",
    "to prevent the inner disk s outer edge from expanding too far beyond the roche limit in a single time step due to the tidal disruption of a large object , we implement a tidal stripping mechanism for large objects .",
    "if a body s mass is greater than @xmath129 , we remove 20% of its mass at each time step once its distance to the primary is @xmath130 , so that large bodies are entirely disrupted over a few time steps . since the time step in symba is @xmath131 of the orbital period at 1 earth radius , large bodies are then effectively disrupted over a timescale @xmath132 minutes , which is much shorter than their orbital period . on some runs ,",
    "this still leads to the outer disk edge temporarily expanding to @xmath133 , but then new bodies are formed from fragmentation ( see previous section ) , and the disk outer edge returns to close to the roche limit in a few tens of orbits .",
    "generally this happens late in simulations , when the disk mass is @xmath134 , so we believe it does not greatly affect the outcome of our simulations .",
    "we note that the orbits of bodies passing through the inner disk would also be affected by drag interaction with inner disk material .",
    "for example , an object that encounters a mass comparable to its own during a single passage through the inner disk would be captured by the inner disk .",
    "we neglect this process here , since it depends sensitively on the disk properties ( notably its scale height and radial surface density profile ) , which are treated in a simplified fashion by our model .",
    "we begin by performing pure n - body simulations , using the angle - average accretion criterion , for direct comparison with previous results of @xcite , using initial disk parameters given in table 1 of that paper and summarized in our table [ table_nbody_dataset ] .    for runs 1 to 14 , the initial disk mass is @xmath135 , and the index of the particle size distribution , @xmath136 is @xmath137 .",
    "different values are used for the disk s outer edge @xmath138 , the surface density distribution exponent @xmath139 @xmath140 , and the number of particles @xmath109 . for runs 15 to 19 , the disk s outer edge and exponent of the surface density distribution @xmath139 are held constant , while @xmath141 and @xmath142 are varied .",
    "we run each simulation for @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the orbital period at one earth radius .",
    "this timescale is equivalent to that of @xcite , who use a simulation time of @xmath145 , with @xmath146 being the orbital period at @xmath9 .",
    "particles are distributed randomly throughout the disk , with initial eccentricities and inclinations ( in radians ) of order @xmath147 as in @xcite .",
    "we use their values for the normal and tangential coefficients of restitution , with @xmath148 and @xmath149 . damping only the normal component of the relative velocity of colliding particles",
    "can lead to situations in which two particles remain in close physical contact but do not actually merge by our accretion criteria , since the tangential component of their relative velocity remains unchanged .",

    "the total of the 3 curves is not equal to 1 because many bodies are trapped in the 2:1 moon s resonance , at which point their `` fate '' has not yet been decided.,width=302 ]    when the moon s 2:1 resonance is initially located just outside the disk s outer edge at @xmath221 , spawned moonlets are not captured into the resonance .",
    "the latter requires that the change in a moonlet s semi - major axis due to an external torque in one libration period of the resonance be much less than the libration width of the resonance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this adiabatic condition is violated when the 2:1 is very near the disk edge , because the rate of increase in a moonlet s semi - major axis due to disk torques is typically too rapid as it crosses the resonance for inner disk masses @xmath222 .",
    "however as the moon s orbit expands outward due to scattering as described above , its 2:1 resonance moves away from the disk edge .",
    "the disk torque on a moonlet as it crosses the resonance is then weaker due to a greater separation between the moonlet and the disk s edge , and capture into the 2:1 resonance can occur as the disk is dissipating . for example , in run 34 , newly spawned moonlets begin to be trapped in the moon s 2:1 at about @xmath223 , when the 2:1 has moved outward to about @xmath224 , and the inner disk mass has decreased to @xmath225 .",
    "an inner moonlet trapped in the 2:1 resonance continues to receive a positive torque from the inner disk , but because it is in resonance with the moon , the torque causes both the inner body s and the moon s semi - major axes to expand in lock - step . in this way",
    "the moon s orbit is driven outward due to indirect resonant interactions with the disk , with the inner moonlets acting as an angular momentum relay between the disk and the moon .",
    "most moonlets captured into the moon s 2:1 resonance are ultimately absorbed by the inner disk and are not accreted by the moon because the resonance prevents close encounters between the moonlets and the moon , while at the same time increasing moonlet eccentricities to high values that lead to close passes by the earth and tidal disruption .",
    "however in cases where multiple moonlets are captured into the 2:1 , mutual moonlet interactions on occasion scatter objects out of resonance and allow them to be accreted by the moon .    thus due first to the effects of inward scattered moonlets that are lost to the inner disk , and then to moonlet capture into the 2:1 resonance with the moon , the efficiency of accretion onto the moon decreases substantially in the @xmath226 to @xmath227 period , while the moon s semi - major axis increases substantially .",
    "this period is also associated with a rapid increase in the total mass of particles that are absorbed by the inner disk ( figure [ fig_sma_largest_body ] , black line ) .    by @xmath228 , the inner disk mass in run 34",
    "has decreased to @xmath229 , and the disk viscosity transitions to the ward - cameron viscosity .",
    "the viscosity then decreases rapidly as the disk dissipates ( since @xmath230 ) , causing the production rate of spawned moonlets to slow dramatically ( see figure [ fig_disk_mass_evolution ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig_disk_mass_evolution ] shows the evolution of the roche - interior disk mass ( solid line ) , of the mass falling onto the planet from the roche - interior disk ( dashed lined ) , and of the mass of new objects accreted from the inner disk ( dotted line ) , for run 34 .",
    "new objects are accreted at the disk s outer edge only after @xmath187 ( figure [ fig_disk_mass_evolution ] , dotted line ) . at that point ,",
    "the disk has lost @xmath231 , that is @xmath232 of its initial mass ( figure [ fig_disk_mass_evolution ] , dashed line ) . at @xmath233 ,",
    "the roche - interior disk is almost depleted in mass , and no significant mass is accreted after that point ( figure [ fig_disk_mass_evolution ] , solid and dotted lines ) .",
    "the aforementioned dynamical steps are present in 28 of the 46 runs , but other outcomes are possible . during the first phase of accretion",
    ", interactions between initial outer bodies can lead to the moon forming farther away , around @xmath234 or beyond . in such cases , the moon",
    "s 2:1 resonance is far enough from the disk that newly spawned moonlets are immediately captured in the resonance .",
    "subsequent interactions between moonlets can then result in some of them being ejected from the resonance and colliding with the moon , just like in the general mechanism described above , or it can lead to the growth of a secondary object inside the resonance . in such cases the moon can be driven out to @xmath235 , at which point the secondary body s semi - major axis is @xmath236 where it does not interact with the inner disk anymore .",
    "the interior body can sometimes get even more massive than the body resulting from accretion of the initial outer particles ( e.g. runs 11 and 16 ) .    for runs 1 and 2 that do not include an initial outer disk ,",
    "the outcome is similar to those described above .",
    "the first body accreted at the roche limit confines the inner disk inside the roche limit .",
    "as the disk viscously spreads outward , the body recoils from the disk and a second body is spawned at the roche limit after @xmath186 .",
    "the disk is once again confined and the second body recoils until it finally merges with the first one .",
    "this process continues until the moon gets far enough from the disk to start capturing bodies in resonance after several tens of years . at that point ,",
    "interactions between particles leads to the accretion of a second large object that moves in resonance with the first one . in run 1",
    "the resonant configuration remains stable , while in run 2 it eventually goes unstable due to interactions with other objects , resulting in a merger of the two largest objects .",
    "the mass , angular momentum and mass fraction of inner disk material of the largest body from each of the hybrid simulations are shown in table [ table_nbodyandfluid_results ] .",
    "the mass of the largest body at @xmath237 , versus the disk s initial specific angular momentum , is represented in figure [ fig_nbodyandfluid_results ] .",

    "accretion efficiency , defined as @xmath242 , is somewhat lower than in pure n - body simulations , as the fraction of the disk accreted varies from @xmath243 to 50% , with the rest being either ejected from the system or lost onto the planet . as in @xcite and @xcite , we find that @xmath242 increases with the initial specific angular momentum of the disk .",

    "our initial setup consists of a fluid disk extending from the earth s surface to the roche limit at @xmath276 , and individual particles beyond .",
    "we find that the moon accretes in 3 consecutive phases , accreting first from the bodies initially present outside the roche limit , which confine the inner disk within the roche limit .",

    "first , consideration of a fluid inner disk leads to a lengthening of the moon s total accretion timescale to @xmath0 , vs. a timescale of @xmath40 predicted by pure n - body models .",
    "material that rapidly accretes outside the roche limit resonantly confines the inner disk , which delays the accretion of the inner disk material until the disk can viscously spread back out to the roche limit . for a fluid disk with a thermally regulated viscosity @xcite",
    ", the latter typically requires @xmath277 .",
    "the inner disk material is then preferentially accreted during the last stages of the moon s growth .",
    "in contrast , in pure n - body models the viscosity of the inner disk is large and the disk spreads very quickly ( in @xmath40 ) , so that inner and outer disk material is accreted more - or - less simultaneously by the growing moon .",
    "the prolonged period of interaction between the fluid inner disk ( and moonlets spawned from it ) and the outer moon also leads to a substantially larger semi - major axis for the final moon , with @xmath278 vs. @xmath15 in the pure n - body simulations .",
    "a larger initial semi - major axis for the moon in turn implies a somewhat lower overall accretion efficiency for a given initial disk mass and angular momentum , with our hybrid simulations finding that only 20 to 50% of the initial total disk mass is ultimately incorporated into the moon .",
    "this suggests that an initial disk mass @xmath279 is required to produce a lunar mass moon , which is somewhat larger than that produced to date by most impact simulations ( e.g. , canup et al .",
    "2012 ) that produce a planet - disk system whose angular momentum is comparable to that in the current earth and moon .      a key constraint on prior impact simulations is the present angular momentum of the earth - moon system , which constrains the impactor size , the impact angle , and the relative velocity . for an impact angular momentum comparable to @xmath249 ,",
    "the outcome of the impact is a circumterrestrial disk composed primarily of impactor material ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the moon accreted from such a disk , it would then have a composition close to that of the impactor .",
    "the earth - moon system shows striking compositional similarities , in particular regarding oxygen isotopes @xcite .",
    "however , the distribution of this element in the early solar system was very heterogeneous @xcite .",
    "in addition , the scale of radial mixing found in terrestrial accretion simulations @xcite implies that the impactor would have had a substantially different composition from that of the earth @xcite , which contradicts the observed similarities .",
    "it has been suggested that mixing could occur between the disk s atmosphere and that of the earth , leading to the equilibration of disk - planet compositions in @xmath280 @xcite .",
    "this is much longer than the accretion timescales predicted by n - body simulations .",
    "however , in our model , the slow spreading of the disk delays the final accretion of the moon by several hundreds of years , which could be compatible with estimated equilibration timescales .",
    "the 3-step accretion mechanism revealed in our simulations implies that only material accreted during the final stage would have been processed through the roche - interior disk .",
    "earth - like material could then naturally end up in the outer parts of the moon , although mixing in the lunar interior would need to be taken into consideration .",
    "we can however adopt an idealized model for the moon where initial outer disk bodies accrete into a _ core _ with radius @xmath281 , and material processed in the inner disk piles up later to increase the radius to @xmath282 . noting @xmath283 the mass fraction of inner disk material",

    "the earth - like material would represent a @xmath291-deep outer layer on the moon . whether this would be sufficient to explain the identical composition between earth and the lunar samples is not clear .",
    "[ section_model_limitations ]      in our model we assume the disk maintains a uniform surface density profile",
    ". numerical simulations of the viscous evolution of self - gravitating dense planetary rings show that the disk evolves with a density peak inward and lower densities in the outer regions , regardless of the disk s initial profile @xcite . in the instability - driven regime , this would increase ( decrease ) the viscosity close to the planet ( at the roche limit ) .",
    "the opposite would happen in the radiation - limited regime ( see equations ( [ equ_viscosity_wc ] ) and ( [ equ_viscosity_ts ] ) ) . a higher viscosity and/or surface density close to the roche limit would decrease the ability of exterior moonlets to confine the inner disk , since the balance between the viscous and resonant torque would be more difficult to achieve . as a result , more material may be brought viscously through the roche limit , thus possibly improving the accretion efficency , resulting in a larger moon formed for a given disk mass , compared to the slab model . however , since the mass necessary to confine the inner disk with the present model is so much smaller than a lunar mass , confinement of the inner disk and the associated phase ( 2 ) of the accretion process seem inevitable when forming a lunar - mass moon ( see section [ section_three_stage_accretion ] ) .",
    "simulation of the radial , as well as temporal , evolution of the inner disk is certainly possible ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although more computationally intensive , and such modeling is planned in our future work .",
    "another simplification adopted for the viscous spreading of the fluid disk is the computation of the mass fluxes at the disk s inner and outer edges .",
    "both of these fluxes are estimated using the viscosity at the roche limit .",
    "however , the viscosity varies with distance as @xmath292 or @xmath293 .",
    "thus we overestimate the rate of mass loss onto the planet , and we expect that future models that include the variation of viscosity with distance may increase the disk lifetime . as a consequence , we can expect more material to be delivered through the roche limit , thus increasing the fraction of potentially equilibrated material incorporated in the final moon .",
    "our inner disk model assumes that both the vapor and condensed phases viscously evolve as a single unit .",
    "this is motivated by the @xcite disk model in which the liquid and vapor phases remain vertically well - mixed .",
    "recently @xcite has developed a generalized description of vertical disk structures appropriate for a two - phase silicate protolunar disk .",
    "he identifies alternative disk solutions that involve a stratified disk , in which the condensates settle to the disk mid - plane and are surrounded by a gravitationally stable vapor atmosphere .",
    "the mid - plane layer then has a large , instability induced viscosity ( per equation ( [ equ_viscosity_wc ] ) ) , while the atmospheric viscosity could be much smaller . the mid - plane layer surface density regulates itself so that the energy dissipated matches that which can be radiated from the surface of a @xmath294 vapor disk @xcite .    to describe such a structure will require separate tracking of the condensate and vapor layers , which we plan in future work . how might this affect the truncation of the inner disk by the outer moon(s ) ? initially resonant torques will cause the outer edge of the liquid layer to contract inward relative to the outer edge of the gas disk .",
    "gas that lies beyond the outer edge of the liquid layer may then condense ( because it was the energy supplied by the underlying condensate layer that was keeping it in the vapor phase ) so that there will be a condensation front that will lie outside the liquid layer s outer edge .",
    "once gas has condensed into liquid , the liquid will be subject to resonant torques and truncated in a similar manner to that found here .      for each satellite ,",
    "we determine which of its resonances fall in the disk and the associated torque .",
    "the total torque exerted by all orbiting objects onto the disk is then applied at the disk s outer edge . as a result",
    ", the confinement of the roche - interior disk may be too efficient . a more realistic model that applies torques at the location of each resonance in the disk ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could increase the ability of inner disk material to spread outward and be accreted by the moon , bringing more potentially equilibrated material to the moon .",
    "our model adopts the standard resonant torque expressions appropriate for a cold disk . for a hot disk , the positions of the inner lindblad resonances",
    "are shifted inward ( and their torques correspondingly reduced ) .",
    "a revised torque expression for the @xmath97 resonance is @xcite :    @xmath295    where @xmath296 is the satellite s gravitational potential , @xmath297 , and @xmath298 is the disk s aspect ratio , with @xmath299 for the protolunar disk(see * ? ? ? * their table 1 ) .",
    "this expression reduces to that given by equation ( [ equ_torque_lindblad ] ) for @xmath300 .",
    "the high @xmath96 resonances that are closest to a satellite are the most affected , which will principally impact the initial recoil of objects close to the disk s edge .",
    "once a satellite migrates outward away from the disk s edge , only its resonances of lower order are in the disk .",
    "of particular importance is the 2:1 resonance  which we argue is responsible for the initiation of phase 2 and the nature of the moon s accretion in phase 3  and the torque due to this resonance is reduced by about 15% due to thermal effects for @xmath301 .",
    "we performed a test simulation using the modified torque expression above and found no substantial modifications to the overall accretion history described in section [ section_accretion_dynamics ] .      to improve computation efficiency ,",
    "we set the smallest fragment that can be spawned from the inner disk to @xmath302 , although fragments some two orders of magnitude smaller than this are predicted when the inner disk s mass decreases to @xmath303 .",
    "this should not significantly impact the outcome of a given simulation , as such small fragments are produced when the disk is almost fully depleted in mass , so that no further growth of the moon is expected . to check the influence of this parameter , we compare results of simulations using 4 values : no limit , @xmath304 , @xmath305 , and @xmath302 .",

    "although the moon s predicted semi - major axis and eccentricity do increase somewhat as the fragment mass is reduced ( due to an increased number of particles captured into resonance as their size decreases ) , results show that the final properties of the moon are not strongly affected by the minimal mass set for the accretion of new moonlets .",
