    "network coding technique has significantly improved the performance of communication networks , and has been studied extensively in the past two decades .",
    "index coding problem ( icp ) can be considered as a special case of network coding problem @xcite .",
    "icp has emerged as an important topic of recent research due to its applications in many of the practically relevant problems including that in satellite networks , topological interference management , wireless caching and cache enabled cloud radio access networks for 5 g cellular systems .",
    "the noiseless index coding problem with side information was first studied in @xcite as an informed - source coding - on - demand ( iscod ) problem , in which a central server ( sender ) wants to broadcast data blocks to a set of clients ( receivers ) which already has a proper subset of the data blocks .",
    "the problem is to minimize the data that must be broadcast , so that each receiver can derive its required data blocks .",
    "consider the case of a sender with @xmath2 messages denoted by the set @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a field with @xmath6 elements , which it broadcasts as coded messages , to a set of @xmath7 receivers , @xmath8 .",
    "each receiver @xmath9 wants a subset @xmath10 of the messages , knows a priori a proper subset @xmath11 of the messages , where @xmath12 , and is identified by the pair @xmath13 .",
    "the noiseless index coding problem is to find the smallest number of transmissions required and is specified by @xmath14 .",
    "the set @xmath11 is referred to as the side information available to the receiver @xmath15 .    an index code ( ic ) for a given icp @xmath14 is defined by an encoding function , @xmath16 and a set of @xmath7 decoding functions @xmath17 @xmath18 corresponding to the @xmath7 receivers , such that , @xmath19    in this paper , we consider icp over binary field ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the integer @xmath21 , as defined above is called the length of the index code . for noiseless broadcast channels , an index code of minimum length",
    "is called an optimal index code @xcite , @xcite . even though this is interesting",
    "theoretically , index coding over noisy channels is more practical .",
    "noisy index coding over a binary symmetric channel was considered in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "binary transmission of index coded bits were assumed .",
    "for this set up the problem of identifying the number of optimal index codes possible for a given icp is important and that was studied in @xcite , @xcite .    a special case of icp over gaussian broadcast channel , based on multidimensional qam constellation with @xmath22 points , where every receiver demands all messages ( which it does not have ) from the source , was considered in @xcite .",
    "the case of noisy index coding over awgn broadcast channel , along with minimum euclidean distance decoding , was studied in @xcite , where the receivers demand a subset of messages as defined in @xcite . an algorithm to map the broadcast vectors to psk signal points so that the receiver with maximum side information gets maximum psk side information coding gain , was also proposed .",
    "the algorithm assumes that an index code is given and is applicable only for one specific order of priority ( in the non increasing order of amount of side information ) among the receivers .",
    "minimum euclidean distance of the effective broadcast signal set seen by a receiver , was considered as the basic parameter which decides the message error probability of the receiver and the proposed algorithm tries to maximize the minimum euclidean distance .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoder for index coded psk modulation .",
    "further , we study the case in which the length of the index code is specified for the icp but not necessarily the index code .",
    "the receivers can have any a priori defined arbitrary order of priority among themselves .",
    "for a chosen priority order , we consider all possible index codes , to obtain the mappings to appropriate psk constellation which will result in the best message error performance in terms of psk index coding gain ( psk - icg , defined in section [ isd_section ] ) of the receivers , respecting the defined order of priority .",
    "consider a noisy index coding problem with @xmath2 messages , over @xmath23 which uses an awgn broadcast channel for transmission .",
    "for the icp @xmath14 , consider index codes of length @xmath1 , @xmath24 , which will generate @xmath0 broadcast vectors ( elements of @xmath25 ) .",
    "the broadcast vectors are mapped to @xmath0-psk signal points , so that @xmath0-psk modulation can be used , to minimize the bandwidth requirement .",
    "note that , transmitting one @xmath0-psk signal point instead of @xmath1 binary bits ( as in noiseless index coding ) , results in @xmath26 fold saving in bandwidth .",
    "our contributions are summarized below :    * we derive a decision rule for maximum likelihood decoding which gives the best message error performance , for any receiver @xmath15 , for a given index code and mapping . * we show that , at very high snr , the message error performance of the receiver employing ml decoder , depends on the minimum inter - set distance ( defined in section [ isd_section ] ) .",
    "the mapping which maximized the minimum inter - set distance is optimal for the best message error performance at high snr .",
    "* for the icp @xmath14 , when the receivers are arranged in the decreasing order of priority , we propose an algorithm to find ( index code , mapping ) pairs , each of which gives the best message error performance for the receivers , for the given order of priority .",
    "using any one of the above ( index code , mapping ) pairs , the highest priority receiver achieves the maximum possible gain ( psk - icg ) that it can get using any ic and any mapping for @xmath0-psk constellation , at very high snr .",
    "given that the highest priority receiver achieves its best performance , the next highest priority receiver achieves its maximum gain possible and so on in the specified order of priority .",
