    "the connection between gravity and thermodynamics was first noted in the pioneering works of bekenstein @xcite and hawking @xcite on black hole thermodynamics . later on the idea",
    "was further expanded by unruh @xcite who identified the connection between acceleration and temperature , demonstrating that an accelerating observer will observe a black - body radiation whose temperature would be proportional to his acceleration . employing these ideas and turning the line of argument around ,",
    "jacobson @xcite derived the einstein field equations from the laws of thermodynamics , based on the assumption that the proportionality between area and entropy , derived by bekenstein for black holes , is universal .",
    "similar results were also obtained by padmanabhan in a series of works reviewed in @xcite .",
    "verlinde @xcite introduced the idea that newton s law of gravitation can be understood as an entropic force , basing this result on the holographic approach and the thermodynamical formulation of gravity ; similar ideas were also presented by padmanabhan @xcite .    on the other hand , seemingly unrelated to the thermodynamic interpretation of gravity ,",
    "gravitational theory is faced with observational challenges .",
    "observational discrepancies between the observed mass in a galaxy and its galactic rotation curves and large velocities in galaxy clusters are already long standing problems .",
    "attempts to solve this observational puzzle have resulted in the introduction of `` dark matter '' as well as alternative gravity theories such as modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite . in the late 1990 s",
    ", a second cloud appeared in the horizon , when observations of distant red shift relations indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite , implying a positive cosmological constant @xmath2 .",
    "the idea of a cosmological constant was first introduced by einstein himself , as it appears naturally in his field equations .",
    "however problems arise when considering its observed physical value and the attempt to connect it with the quantum mechanical vacuum energy .",
    "mond , introduced ad hoc to solve discrepancies on the galactic scale , has also had success in explaining observations regarding superclusters @xcite .",
    "however it seemed to have no cosmological predictions .",
    "it is thus surprising to find out that the acceleration scale @xmath0 introduced into mond to phenomenologically explain the observed galaxy rotation curves , is related to the value of the hubble constant , @xmath3 , through the relationship @xmath4 @xcite and to the cosmological constant as well @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these seemingly unconnected views of gravity , i.e. mond and the thermodynamic approach are nevertheless interlinked , and obtaining an underlying microscopic theory for them will help explain the cosmological aspects of mond . from the thermodynamic representation of gravity it seems natural to relate the constant @xmath0 , having dimensions of acceleration , to a temperature via the unruh relationship , resulting in a temperature scale .",
    "based on verlinde s idea of gravity being an entropic force , several attempts have been recently made to obtain mond by considering some of the degrees of freedom on the holographic screen to be frozen out . in @xcite mond",
    "was obtained by considering a one dimensional debye model for the excitations on the holographic screen thus restricting the excited degrees of freedom at low temperatures , whereas @xcite considered collective excitations on the holographic screen thus obtaining mond .",
    "mond was also obtained by considering a minimal temperature on the holographic screen @xcite and relating it to @xmath0 . in @xcite a non - homogenous cooling of the holographic screen",
    "was considered resulting from a phase transition occurring at a critical temperature ; under this assumption a modified friedmann equation compatible with mond theory was also obtained .",
    "this work was followed and extended by @xcite in which entropic corrections to the theory where considered .",
    "the work in @xcite should also be noted for obtaining mond through entropic volume corrections to newton s law .",
    "the present work simply assumes that degrees of freedom on the holographic screen should be treated through the quantum - statistical - mechanics formalism ; following this assumption we not only obtain mond but we are able to calculate its interpolating function @xmath1 and compare it to leading phenomenological expressions which are based on astronomical data .    in sec .",

    "the connection between gravity and thermodynamics has been greatly developed by padmanabhan @xcite and verlinde @xcite . in this section",
    "we choose to describe this connection through a formulation introduced by verlinde .",
    "we start by briefly introducing this formulation following section 3 of his paper @xcite , which is based on four well known essential equations from which one obtains newtonian gravity theory .",
    "consider a point mass , @xmath6 , surrounded by a spherical holographic screen of radius @xmath7 .",
    "thermodynamics on the holographic screen is connected to gravitation by applying two equations .",
    "the first is the unruh relation between the temperature , @xmath8 and the acceleration @xmath9 of an observer at the screen , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the speed of light and @xmath12 is boltzmann s constant . for simplicity of notation we shall use energy units such that @xmath13 .",
    "the second relationship is the relation obtained by bekenstein for the number of bits or degrees of freedom , @xmath14 , on the horizion of a black hole , which verlinde extends to the holographic screen , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the area of the holographic screen and @xmath17 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "the two remaining equations needed to complete the model are einstein s mass , energy , @xmath18 , relation @xmath19 and the thermodynamic equipartition rule @xmath20 it should be noted that in this approach it is the gravitational energy of eq .",
    "( [ eq : einstein ] ) which is related to thermal excitations on the holographic screen .    combining these four equations ( [ eq : unruh]-[eq : equipartition ] ) , and expressing the holographic screen area by its radius , @xmath21 , one directly obtains newton s law of gravitation , @xmath22",
    "in this section we extend verlinde s model , introduced in the previous section , by considering the quantum particle statistics of the bits on the holographic screen . the equipartition rule described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : equipartition ] ) is considered as the dulong petite law , valid for the high temperature limit , which needs to be modified at lower temperatures due to the underlying particle statistics .",
    "it will be shown that considering the quantum statistical nature of the excitations on the holographic screen leads to mond ( for a recent review of mond theory see @xcite ) .",
    "we start by considering fermionic excitations , on the holographic screen . in defining the particle statistics of fermions one needs to introduce an energy scale , the fermi energy @xmath24 , which distinguishes between excited thermal states and states which are `` frozen out '' . in the case of fermionic excitations of the holographic screen",
    ", this energy scale will be related to @xmath0 . in verlinde s thermodynamic gravitational formulation ,",
    "gravitational effects are related only to the thermal excitations of the holographic screen , as can be deduced from the equipartition rule ( [ eq : equipartition ] ) .",
    "thus in considering gravitational effects the systems ground state energy should be ignored and one should consider only thermal excitations .",
    "we begin by calculating the energy @xmath25 , of an excited two dimensional fermionic system due to the heating of the system to a temperature @xmath8 , and use the expression obtained to replace the equipartition relation ( [ eq : equipartition ] ) .",

    "the energy was denoted as @xmath25 to distinguish it from the energy appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : einstein ] , [ eq : equipartition ] ) , which is the gravitational energy related only to thermal excitations . calculating the integral to second order in the temperature one obtains @xmath31 the number of particles in the system , is given by @xmath32 + 1 } , \\label{eq : number}\\ ] ] in our derivation we consider the particle number , @xmath33 , to be the free variable whereas @xmath30 is determined through eq .",

    "one obtains @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the system s fermi energy .",
    "finite temperature corrections to the particle number are exponentially small in @xmath37 .",
    "we can now express the system s thermal energy , @xmath38 , in terms of the temperature , the particle number and the fermi energy , @xmath39 the above expression for the thermal energy replaces the equipartition relation ( [ eq : equipartition ] ) .    employing eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy_th ] ) , we follow verlinde s steps using the three remaining equations ( [ eq : unruh]-[eq : einstein ] ) and some algebraic manipulations to obtain mond .",
    "we start by obtaining an expression for the temperature squared , @xmath40 relating the temperature to the acceleration through the unruh formula ( [ eq : unruh ] ) , we obtain @xmath41 in two dimensions @xmath42 where @xmath14 is the number of degrees of freedom and is equal to the number of planck cells on the holographic screen .",

    "we obtained the above correspondence for @xmath0 by introducing fermionic degrees of freedom on the holographic screen and considering the deep mond regime , i.e. , very low accelerations , @xmath51 .",
    "the high temperature regime was shown to correspond to the newtonian limit . in the intermediate regime mond",
    "is characterized by an interpolating function @xmath1 which defines the mond formula @xmath52 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the function @xmath53 , in the low acceleration regime @xmath54 is @xmath55 corresponding to the deep mond limit , and in the high acceleration limit @xmath56 , defining the newtonian limit described above .",

    "we have performed this calculation numerically and the result is expressed in fig .",

    "as expected the function crosses over from a linear dependence for small @xmath9 ( low temperatures ) to a @xmath60 dependence for large @xmath9 ( high temperature ) .",
    "the result is compared with two leading phenomenological expressions for the mond @xmath1 function , @xmath61 , known as the `` simple '' @xmath30-function which is expressed in the figure as a dot - dashed line and @xmath62 , which is also commonly used @xcite , known as the `` standard '' interpolating function , designated in the figure by the dotted line .",
    "both interpolating functions belong to the @xmath63family of interpolating functions @xmath64 , where the @xmath65 describes the `` simple '' interpolating function and the @xmath66 the `` standard '' interpolating function .",
    "it should however be noted that these mond interpolating functions are put in by hand , whereas the function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu_ratio_eth ] ) is a result of physical considerations .",
    "the data on galaxy rotation curves is becoming more and more restrictive regarding which functions can be considered as reasonable interpolating functions .",
    "nowadays the data seem to favor the `` simple '' , @xmath65 interpolating function or some interpolation between @xmath65 to the `` standard '' interpolating function @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic interpolating function we have calculated seems to do exactly that .",

    "we can obtain @xmath18 in terms of the low temperature specific heat , thus @xmath75 from eq .",

    "however , the physical basis for mond is revealed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu_ratio_eth ] ) , which shows that the interpolating mond function @xmath77 is essentially the relative number of thermal excitations since it is given by the ratio of the thermal excitation energy divided by the high temperature thermal excitation energy , where in this limit each degree of freedom gets an energy of @xmath78 .    in the high temperature limit",
    "the physics does not depend on the quantum nature of excitations .",
    "rather each excited degree of freedom receives an energy of @xmath79 as defined by the equipartition rule . in this limit",
    "we can simply follow verlinde s formulation and obtain newtonian dynamics .",
    "the newtonian limit in the formulation of mond obtained by taking the limit @xmath80 , has a simple physical meaning , in the formulation of mond via the specific heat , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu_specific_heat ] ) the newtonian limit results directly from the dulong petite law .",
    "even though the high temperature limit is governed by the dulong petite law obtaining the first asymptotic correction to @xmath1 in the high temperature limit @xmath81 is not straightforward .",
    "@xmath1 is proportional to the ratio between the thermal energy and the temperature ( [ eq : mu_ratio_eth ] ) in the dulong petite law the energy is linear in temperature however there is also a temperature independent part to the energy as can be deduced from eq .",

    "the above relationship ( [ eq : mu_specific_heat ] ) between the two dimensional specific heat and @xmath1 in the mond equation was obtained for fermions , however in two dimensions the specific heat for an ideal gas of fermi particles is identical to the specific heat of an ideal bose gas for all @xmath8 and @xmath14 .",

    "the result for bosons is expressed in terms of @xmath86 , instead of in terms of @xmath36 .",
    "it should be realized that the temperature scale @xmath86 does not correspond to a critical temperature associated with a phase transition ; quite the opposite is true .",

    "the relationship between the mond acceleration scale @xmath0 and the hubble constant @xmath103 was obtained in observations .",
