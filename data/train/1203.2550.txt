    "in most practical scenarios , perfect channel state information at transmitter ( csit ) may not be available due to the time - varying nature of wireless channels as well as the limited resource for channel estimation .",
    "however , many wireless applications must guarantee high - data rate and reliable communication in the presence of channel uncertainty . in this paper",
    ", we consider such a scenario in the context of the two - user multiple - input single - output  ( miso ) broadcast channel , where the transmitter equipped with @xmath3 antennas  ( @xmath4 ) wishes to send two private messages to two receivers each with a single antenna .",
    "the discrete time signal model is given by    @xmath5    for any time instant @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are the channel vectors for user  1 and user  2 , respectively ; @xmath8 are normalized additive white gaussian noises  ( awgn ) at the respective receivers ; the input signal @xmath9 is subject to the power constraint @xmath10 , @xmath11 .    for the case of perfect csit ,",
    "the optimal degrees of freedom  ( dof ) of this channel is two and achieved by linear strategies such as zero - forcing  ( zf ) beamforming .",
    "when the transmitter suffers from constant inaccuracy of channel estimation , it has been shown in @xcite that the degrees of freedom per user is upper - bounded by @xmath12 , whereas the highest known achievable dof value , also conjectured to be optimal , is only @xmath13 .",
    "it is also well known that the full multiplexing gain can be maintained under imperfect csit if the error in csit decreases as @xmath14 as @xmath1 grows @xcite . moreover , for the case of the temporally correlated fading channel such that the transmitter can predict the current state with error decaying as @xmath15 for some constant @xmath16 $ ] , zf can only achieve a fraction @xmath17 of the optimal degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this result somehow reveals the bottleneck of a family of precoding schemes relying only on instantaneous csit as the temporal correlation decreases ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "recently , a breakthrough has been made in order to overcome this problem . in @xcite ,",
    "maddah - ali and tse showed a surprising result that even completely outdated csit can be very useful in terms of degrees of freedom , as long as it is accurate . for a system with @xmath4 antennas and two users ,",
    "the proposed scheme in @xcite , hereafter called mat , achieves the multiplexing gain of @xmath12 per user , irrespectively of the temporal correlation .",
    "the role of perfect delayed csit can be re - interpreted as a feedback of the past signal / interference heard by the receivers .",
    "this side information enables the transmitter to perform `` retrospective '' alignment in the space _ and _ time domain , as demonstrated in different multiuser network systems ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . despite its dof optimality",
    ", the mat scheme is designed assuming the worst case scenario where the delayed channel feedback provides no information about the current channel state .",
    "this assumption is over pessimistic as most practical channels exhibit some form of temporal correlation .",
    "in fact , it readily follows that the selection strategy between zf and mat yields the degrees of freedom of @xmath19 for @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "for either quasi - static fading channel  ( @xmath20 ) or very fast channels  ( @xmath21 ) , a selection approach is reasonable .",
    "however , for intermediate ranges of temporal correlation ( @xmath22 ) , a fundamental question arises as to whether a better way of exploiting both delayed csit and current ( imperfect ) csit exists . studying the dof under such a csit assumption is of practical and theoretical interest .",
    "the main contributions of this work are summarized in the following .",
    "first , we establish an outer bound on the dof region of the two - user broadcast channel with perfect delayed and imperfect current state information . to that end",
    ", we use two powerful tools : the genie - aided model and the extremal inequality  @xcite .",
    "then , we propose a novel scheme that optimally combines the zf spatial precoding , based on the imperfect current state information , and the mat space - time alignment , based on the perfect past state information .",
    "the key of this scheme is the digital transmission of the overheard interference , which replaces the analog one initially considered in the mat alignment  @xcite .",
    "the role of spatial precoding , exploiting current csit , is two - fold :    * it enables to reduce the power of overheard interferences in the mat alignment .",
    "this power reduction then saves , via source compression / quantization , the resource related to the transmission of the overheard interferences .",
    "* it allows for the parallel transmission of two private messages on top of the multicast of overheard interferences as common message .",
    "it will be shown that the proposed scheme achieves the upper bound of the symmetric dof @xmath23    \\]]given by the converse . to achieve the other corner points of the region ,",
    "we show that delayed csit is not necessary and the optimal strategy is a combination of rate - splitting , spatial precoding with imperfect current csi , and superposition coding .",
    "specifically , we split one of the users message into two parts and broadcast one part of it as common message .",
    "the other part and the message of the other user are then superimposed over the common message and broadcast with spatial precoding . as an extension to the main result",
    ", we derive the optimal dof region of the same channel with common message .",
    "another extension is the achievable dof region when only imperfect delayed csit is available  ( e.g. , due to limited feedback rates ) . finally , in addition to the results on the optimal dof region , we provide the exact achievable rate regions of the proposed schemes in the appendix .",
    "at the time of submission , a parallel independent work  @xcite was brought to our attention which also builds on our initial results reported in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , the authors consider an i.i.d .",
    "fading model in which the transmitter knows perfectly the past channel states and imperfectly the current channel state .",
    "their achievability proof coincides with our optimal scheme , while the outer bound is derived differently by establishing an equivalent compound channel .",
    "it is worth noting that the outer bound technique developed in @xcite does not rely on any essential statistical equivalence of the two users channel vector directions , which is stronger than both the original result of @xcite as well as the result in this work  ( that exploits the isotropic property of the estimation error ) . on the other hand ,",
    "our model allows temporal correlations of the channel coefficients and is therefore stronger than both the original result  @xcite and @xcite in that sense .",
    "thus , while both @xcite and the current work generalize @xcite , neither subsumes the other .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ] , after presenting the assumptions and some basic definitions of our model , we provide our main theorem on the optimal dof region .",
    "the above contributions are then presented in order .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "detailed proofs are deferred to the appendix .    throughout the paper",

    ", we implicitly assume that @xmath65 in the rest of the paper .",
    "the case with @xmath70 corresponds to the case of perfect csit , in which the capacity region is already known .",
    "then , we can introduce a parameter @xmath71 as the power exponent of the estimation error @xmath72 the parameter @xmath73 can be regarded as the quality of the current csit in the high snr regime . note that @xmath74 corresponds to the case with no current csit at all , while @xmath75 corresponds to the case with perfect current csit .",
    "in addition , we assume that @xmath76 exists and define @xmath77hereafter , we use @xmath17 instead of @xmath73 , whenever no confusion is likely .",
    "in addition , since @xmath78 implies that the estimation noise is negligible as compared to the awgn and can be regarded as perfect from the dof perspective , we assume implicitly that the value of @xmath78 is truncated at @xmath59 wherever applicable .",

    "to show the achievability of the whole region , it is enough to show that all corner points in fig .",
    "[ fig : dof - region ] are achievable .",
    "note that the extreme points @xmath94 and @xmath90 can be trivially achieved by serving only one of the users .",
    "the rest of the section is devoted to proving the achievability of @xmath93 , @xmath91 , and @xmath145 .",
    "since the dof region does not depend on the number of transmit antennas  @xmath3 , @xmath146 , it is enough to prove the achievability for the case @xmath147 which is assumed implicitly in this section .",
    "the exact achievable rate region from which the dof can be derived in a more rigorous way is provided in the appendix .",
    "one of the key elements to achieve the three corner points is broadcasting with common message in the presence of imperfect current csit .",
    "the following result is crucial and will be repeatedly used in the proofs .",
    "[ lemma : bc - cm ] let @xmath148 be the rate of common message , private message for user  1 , and private message for user  2 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we let @xmath149 be the corresponding dof .",
    "then , there exists a family of codes  @xmath150 , such that @xmath151are achievable simultaneously .",

    "the power of the common signal is @xmath157 .",
    "the decoding is performed as follows . at each receiver",
    ", the common message is decoded first by treating the private signals as noise .",
    "the signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio  ( sinr ) is approximately @xmath158 , from which the achievability of @xmath159 is shown .",
    "then , each receiver decodes their own private messages , after removing the decoded common message .",
    "the sinr for the private message being approximately @xmath156 , @xmath160 is thus achievable for user  @xmath84 , @xmath86 . from the above lemma ,",
    "the achievability of @xmath93 is straightforward .",
    "let @xmath80 and @xmath81 be the messages for user  1 and user  2 , respectively .",
    "assuming that the dof are respectively @xmath161 and @xmath162 , we can split user  1 s message as @xmath163 with the corresponding rate - splitting @xmath164 . then , @xmath165 are broadcast to both users with @xmath166 as common message .",
    "according to lemma  [ lemma : bc - cm ] , @xmath167 and @xmath168 can be recovered by user  1 and user  2 , respectively , as long as @xmath169which implies @xmath170 and @xmath171 are achievable simultaneously .",
    "similarly , @xmath172 can also be achieved by the same scheme with rate - splitting over user  2 s message .",

    "a sum dof of @xmath173 is thus attained .",
    "the idea is closely related to the han - kobayashi scheme  @xcite for the two - user interference channel where each receiver can decode and then eliminate the common part of the interfering signal to achieve a higher rate .",

    "the role of this stage is two - fold : _ resolving interference for user  1 and reinforcing signal for user  2_. in the third slot , the transmitter sends the interference overheard by user 2 to help both users the other way around .",
