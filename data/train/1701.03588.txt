    "the development of experimental and theoretical methods of quantum information processing ( qip ) is an important direction of quantum informatics .",
    "nmr methods are the simplest ones among different experimental approaches @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the liquid state nmr methods @xcite are widely used for experimental realizations of quantum gates and algorithms on the basis of the pseudo - pure states @xcite",
    ". however , the possibilities of qip based on the liquid state nmr are limited because the number of correlated qubits is very small ( about 10 ) @xcite and quantum correlations in such systems are not strong .",
    "in particular , entanglement is almost absent @xcite .    at the same time , the potential of the solid state nmr methods @xcite is not exhausted yet .",
    "multiple quantum ( mq ) spectroscopy in solids @xcite is an example of such a method .",
    "mq nmr not only creates multi - qubit coherent states but also allows the investigation of their relaxation under the action of the correlated spin reservoir .",
    "mq nmr @xcite is an important method for the investigation of various problems of quantum information processing such as the transmission of quantum information @xcite and decoherence processes @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional mq nmr methods are very suitable for solving problems of quantum informatics .",
    "the reason is that a consistent quantum - mechanical theory of mq nmr dynamics has been developed only for one - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "that theory is based on the fact that the non - secular two - spin / two - quantum hamiltonian @xcite , describing mq nmr dynamics , is the xy hamiltonian @xcite , which can be diagonalized exactly for one - dimensional systems in the approximation of the nearest neighbor interactions @xcite . as a result , mq nmr dynamics in such systems can be studied analytically . in particular , only mq nmr coherences of the zeroth and plus / minus second orders arise in a one - dimensional chain initially prepared in a thermodynamic equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "the developed theory @xcite is based on the model of an isolated spin chain with the nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "such a model is realized in quasi - one - dimensional chains of nuclei in calcium fluorapatite with a hexagonal system of fluorine nuclei .",
    "the distance between neighboring chains is about three times larger than the distance between the nearest fluorine nuclei in the same chain .",
    "taking into account that the dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) of the next nearest spins in the chain is eight times weaker than the nearest neighbor interaction @xcite one can use the model of an isolated spin chain with the nearest neighbor interactions for the interpretation of the experimental data obtained from the mq nmr experiments @xcite .",
    "the information resource of mq nmr exceeds the resource of conventional nmr @xcite .",
    "however , that resource can be used only if the xy hamiltonian is created with sufficient accuracy @xcite . the xy hamiltonian is obtained as the averaged two - spin / two - quantum hamiltonian @xcite which is the average hamiltonian @xcite in the mq nmr experiments .",
    "the corrections to the average hamiltonian @xcite spoil the xy hamiltonian .",
    "these corrections are proportional to powers of the parameter @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the period of the irradiating sequence of the preparation period of the mq nmr experiment and @xmath2 is of the order of the ddi ) .",
    "we have designed a special probe @xcite for the generation of high - power ultra - short pulses and decreased the period @xmath1 and the parameter @xmath3 in mq nmr experiments .",
    "the results @xcite show high accuracy of creating the xy hamiltonian .",
    "it is very important that the xy hamiltonian ( the mq nmr hamiltonian ) is related to the flip - flop one by a simple unitary transformation @xcite for one - dimensional systems in the approximation of the nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "that fact allows us to realize the quantum state transfer along a one - dimensional spin chain .",
    "it is also significant that the relaxation of the mq nmr coherences can be considered as a model for studying the decoherence processes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "an introduction to mq nmr dynamics is given in section  2 . in section 3",
    "we show that mq nmr can be used for the quantum state transfer in one - dimensional spin chains .",
    "relaxation of the mq nmr coherences in one - dimensional spin chains is discussed in section 4 .",
    "we briefly summarize our results in section 5 .",

    "we considered the methods of mq nmr spectroscopy of one - dimensional spin systems and their application for solving problems of quantum informatics . the quantum state transfer in linear spin chains",
    "can be realized with high fidelity using mq nmr dynamics .",
    "decoherence of many - qubit quantum state created on the preparation period of the mq nmr experiment @xcite can be studied on the evolution period of that experiment . the dipolar relaxation of the mq nmr coherences is considered as a model of the decoherence process .",
