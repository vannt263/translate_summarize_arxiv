    "a theory of network equivalence has been established in  @xcite by koetter et al . to characterize the capacity of a ( large ) memoryless noisy network .",
    "the original noisy network is first decomposed into many independent single - hop noisy channels , each of which is then replaced by the corresponding upper ( resp .",

    "the capacity region of the resulting noiseless network serves as an outer ( resp .",
    "inner ) bound for the capacity region of the original noisy network , whose capacity is otherwise difficult to characterize . a noisy channel and a noiseless bit pipe are said to be equivalent if the capacity region of any arbitrary network that contains the noisy channel remains unchanged after replacing the noisy channel by its noiseless counterpart .",
    "the equivalence between a point - to - point noisy channel and a point - to - point noiseless bit pipe has been established in  @xcite as long as the rate of the latter equals the capacity of the former . for independent single - hop multi - terminal channels , such as the multiple - access channel ( mac ) , the broadcast channel ( bc ) , and the interference channel ( ic ) , operational frameworks for constructing upper and lower bounding models",
    "have been proposed in  @xcite . the constructive proofs presented in  @xcite",
    "are based on a notion of channel emulation over a stacked replicas of the channel , where the lower bounding models are established based on channel coding arguments and the upper bounding models are constructed based on lossy source coding arguments .",
    "the bounding accuracy , in terms of both multiplicative and additive gaps between capacity upper and lower bounds , has been outlined in  @xcite for general noisy networks .",

    "have been specified in  @xcite .",
    "the bounds obtained from network equivalence tools  @xcite can be tight in some setups , as shown in  @xcite for a multiple unicast network consisting of noisy two - user bcs , and in  @xcite for a frequency - division awgn relay network in the wideband regime when the bc is physically degraded or when the source treats the stochastically degraded bc as physically degraded . a class of `` one - shot '' upper bounding models proposed in  @xcite by calmon et al .",
    "introduces an auxiliary node for each bc / mac to facilitate separate characterization of the sum rate and the individual rates .",
    "the rate of a bit pipe from / to the auxiliary node can be characterized either by channel emulation over infinite number of channel uses as in  @xcite , or by emulating the transmission over each channel use ( hence named `` one - shot '' ) .",
    "although it has been established in @xcite that separate source and channel coding incurs no capacity loss in transmitting a memoryless source over a memoryless point - to - point channel , similar separation results on memoryless networks are not known until recently .",
    "the optimality of channel and network coding separation for general communication demands over networks consisting of independent memoryless point - to - point channels is established in  @xcite based on the network equivalence theory , where the networks may be cyclic or acyclic and alphabets can be discrete or continuous .",
    "feedback and cooperation among nodes are also accommodated , but the sources have to be independent . for single - source multicast connections over networks consisting of point - to - point discrete memoryless channels ( dmcs ) with finite alphabets , separation of channel and network coding has been established in  @xcite for acyclic synchronized networks and in  @xcite for asynchronized networks with and without cycles . while both  @xcite and  @xcite rely on the max - flow min - cut theorem @xcite to show the converse ( cf .",
    "upper bounding model ) , similar results on channel - network separation have been established in  @xcite by using normalized entropy vectors . for point - to - point channels , the same upper bounding models established in  @xcite",
    "have also been developed in  @xcite for dmcs with finite - alphabet , and in  @xcite under the notion of strong coordination , where total variation ( i.e. , an additive gap ) is used to measure the difference between the desired joint distribution and the empirical joint distribution of a pair of sequences ( or a pair of symbols as in _ empirical coordination _ ) .",
    "the concept of channel emulation  @xcite , on the other hand , focuses on the set of jointly typical input - output pairs and the difference between the empirical joint distribution ( averaged over ensembles of channel emulators ) and the desired joint distribution is quantified by a multiplicative gap to ensure a small probability of error events .",
    "as we focus on characterizing capacity ( bounds ) rather than reconstructing ( exact ) common randomness for multi - terminal channels , we shall follow the channel emulation framework  @xcite when constructing bounding models for bcs and macs .",
    "it is , however , non - trivial to apply the network equivalence tools  @xcite onto wireless networks owing to the broadcast nature of wireless transmission . on one hand ,",
    "the bounding models proposed in  @xcite for macs / bcs with @xmath0 transmitters / receivers contain up to @xmath1 bit pipes , leading to computational inefficiency when @xmath0 is large ( as in a wireless hot - spot which may contain potentially many users ) . on the other hand , the received signal at a terminal may contain several broadcasted signals , which creates dependence / interference among several transmitter - receiver pairs . although such dependence has been partially incorporated into ics , the whole family of non - layered multi - hop channels ( e.g. , relay channels )",
    "have been excluded from consideration since the channel emulation techniques are developed for single - hop channels .    in this paper , we present simple but efficient methods to construct upper and lower bounding models for wireless networks with potentially many nodes , at a complexity that grows linearly with the number of nodes .",
    "we propose a channel decoupling approach to decompose a memoryless wireless network into decoupled bcs and macs . in our bounding models , the constraints on the sum rate and on the individual rates are characterized by different channel emulation techniques as inspired by  @xcite .",
    "our upper bounding models , which consist of only point - to - point bit pipes , are constructed by first extending the one - shot models for macs / bcs to many - user scenarios and then integrating them with the channel emulation techniques",
    ". our lower bounding models , which contain both point - to - point and point - to - points ( hyper - arc ) bit pipes , are obtained based on a two - step update of the decoupled bcs and macs by taking their dependence into account .",
    "the main advantage of our proposed bounding models are their simplicity and the fact that they can be easily extended to large networks .",
    "we demonstrate by examples that the resulting upper and lower bounds can approach the capacity in some setups .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume memoryless independent sources as in  @xcite , where the optimality of channel - network separation is established for networks with only point - to - point channels .",

    "extension to awgn channels is also established in  @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the distortion components ( e.g. , noise ) are independent from the transmitted signals .",
    "this assumption can be relaxed in scenarios where the noise power is dependent on the power of input signals , and in such scenarios we take the smallest ( resp .",
    "largest ) noise power when constructing upper ( resp .",
    "lower ) bounding models .",
    "we further assume that the distortion components at receiving nodes within a coupled . ]",
    "bc are mutually independent , and the scenario of coupled bc with correlated noise will be investigated in our future work .",
    "note that in this paper our focus is on constructing noiseless bounding networks that can serve as a basis to compute capacity bounds , rather than finding the capacity of a noiseless network , which itself is a very difficult problem  @xcite .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for various computational tools available to characterize ( bounds on ) the capacity of noiseless networks .",
    "there are some other methods aiming at characterizing the capacity of wireless networks .",
    "a deterministic approach proposed in  @xcite can approximate the capacity of gaussian networks within a constant gap in the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime , where amplify - and - forward ( af ) has been proved to approach the capacity in multi - hop layered networks  @xcite .",
    "a layering approach with a global information routing proposed in  @xcite for wireless networks with non - coupled bcs and macs can provide lower bounds within a multiplicative gap from the capacity upper bound .",
    "capacity approximations for multiple unicast transmissions over coupled wireless networks developed in @xcite combines polymatroidal network analysis with carefully designed coding schemes for each independent single - hop interference channel , and the approximation accuracy is characterized for bidirectional networks with symmetric fading coefficients .",
    "since we aim at approaches that can be used in all snr regions and for all communication tasks , we do not follow the methods developed in  @xcite .",
