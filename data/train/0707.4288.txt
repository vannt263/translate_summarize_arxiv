    "in contrast to regions , some elemental abundances in pne are affected by the nucleosynthesis in the pn progenitors .",
    "newly synthesized material can be dredged up by convection in the envelope , significantly altering abundances of he , c , and n in the surface layers during the evolution of the pn progenitor stars on the giant branch and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "also a certain amount of oxygen can be mixed in during the thermally pulsing phase of agb evolution @xcite . in combination , it means that only the ne , s , cl and ar abundances , observed in both hii regions and pne , can be considered as reliable probes of the enrichment history of galaxies , unaffected by the immediately preceding nucleosynthesis in the progenitor stars . @xcite compared observed @xmath15-element - to - oxygen abundance ratios to ones for regions , to estimate additional enrichment in oxygen for type  i pn in the nearby galaxy sextans  a. these authors found significant self - pollution of the pn progenitor , by a factor of @xmath410 in oxygen .",
    "@xcite used the same idea during a study of pn in the fornax dsph galaxy and found that systematically lower ratios for log(s / o ) , log(ar / o ) and log(ne / o ) in this nebula can be easily explained with additional enrichment in oxygen by 0.27@xmath30.10 dex .",
    "after correction for this additional enrichment , all studied ratios increased to the values defined for regions , as shown in figure  [ fig : abun_ratios ] .",
    "this conclusion is additionally supported by the fact that using the same correction for the observed log(cl / o ) ratio in the fornax pn , moved the value to @xmath89 , consistent with the regions ( see panel ( d ) of figure  [ fig : abun_ratios ] ) .",
    "bobn1  in sgr has a complicated abundance pattern , which are hard to show in figure  [ fig : abun_ratios ] , since the differences are about 0.9 dex for log(s / o ) , log(ar / o ) and log(cl / o ) ratios but @xmath90 dex for log(ne / o ) .",
    "we will try to explain neon overabundance for bobn1  in section  [ txt : neon ] below . however , to explain the lower log(s / o ) , log(ar / o ) and log(cl / o ) ratios it is natural to suggest just an additional enrichment in oxygen , following @xcite and @xcite . using the abundance ratios for regions and our observed ratios ,",
    "this self - pollution can be calculated as the weighted average , @xmath91o = 1.09@xmath30.13 dex .",
    "after the correction the resulting oxygen abundance 12+log(o / h ) is 6.72@xmath30.16 dex , that is , 1/110 the solar value @xcite , similar to the metallicity of the old globular cluster terzan 8 in sgr @xcite .",
    "the corrected ratios ( shown in figure  [ fig : abun_ratios ] as open circles ) are log(s / o)@xmath92 , log(ar / o)@xmath93 and log(cl / o)@xmath94 , consistent with the values in regions , showing that a change in oxygen suffices .",
    "finally , we can estimate that the pn progenitor in bobn1  enriched the ejecta by a factor of @xmath4  12 in oxygen and by a factor of @xmath4  240 in nitrogen .",
    "three of five pne in dsph galaxies show observed log(ne / o ) , log(s / o ) , log(ar / o ) and log(cl / o ) ratios consistent with abundance ratios for regions .",
    "this implies that oxygen dredge - up affects abundances only under some circumstances .",
    "@xcite analysed the abundances for the sample of bright pne in dwarf irregular galaxies and also suggested that oxygen is dredged up on occasion , even at very low metallicity .",
    "@xcite argue that oxygen is a byproduct of all third dredge - up , but leads to enrichment only at low metallicity . at solar metallicity ,",
    "the dredged - up material has _",
    "lower _ oxygen abundance than the original gas .",
    "it is uncertain why bobn1  would show a 3@xmath95 dredge - up ( as evidenced by its carbon - rich nature ) while other pne at similar extreme abundances do not .",
    "rotational mixing might be a reason @xcite .",
    "however , if bobn1  is a member of sgr , it can have a younger age and larger progenitor mass than galactic stars of the same metallicity , which favours the occurence of 3@xmath95 dredge - up .",
    "table  [ t : comparison ] shows the elemental abundance of all known pne in dsphs relative to the solar abundance of @xcite .",
    "values for he2 - 436 and wray16 - 423 are from @xcite , and for the fornax pn from @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the abundances of the first two sgr pne are identical within their uncertainties ( 0.05 dex ) , which provides evidence that their progenitor stars formed in a single star burst event within a well - mixed ism .",
    "this star formation episode is estimated to have taken place 5 gyr ago @xcite .",
    "stwr2 - 21  shows significantly higher abundances and likely dates from a more recent event of star formation .",
    "all four objects are strongly enriched in carbon , with c / o ratios between 3 and 29 .",
    "we find that stwr2 - 21  is the most metal - rich pn known for the dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "its [ o / h ] is similar to that of the few most metal - rich pne in the lmc @xcite .",
    "it confirms the existence of a metal - rich population in sgr @xcite , in good agreement with what was found by the spectroscopic analysis of red giants @xcite .",
    "the lack of nitrogen enrichment shows that the initial mass of the progenitor star was @xmath96 and therefore puts a lower limit to the age of @xmath97 .",
    "the n / o versus n / h abundance ratio of stwr2 - 21closely follows the relation for galactic pne @xcite .",
    "bobn1  is , in contrast , the most metal - poor object with well - determined abundances , in sgr .",
    "@xcite argue , based on limited data , that its original abundance was [ fe / h]@xmath98 . we find slightly higher values , with s , ar , cl and fe uniformly indicating an original metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath99 .",
    "the low metallicity indicates that it belongs to the old population of sgr ( see also the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the c / o@xmath100 is notable , showing that the nebular abundances are affected by extreme self - enrichment .",
    "in addition to c , this is also the case for n , o , and , surprisingly , for ne .",
    "bobn1  shows a very unusual abundance pattern , with neon more abundant by number than oxygen .",
    "oxygen and neon are both produced in type - ii supernovae , where they are produced in a fixed ratio .",
    "the abundance ratio is ne / o@xmath101 in a range of environments @xcite , in confirmation of their common origin .",
    "neon is also produced in carbon burning high - mass agb stars and in high - mass novae , but not in amounts exceeding oxygen .",
    "however , significant neon can be produced in the intershell of low - mass agb stars , and this is the likely origin of the enrichment in bobn1 . in the large sample of @xcite ,",
    "the ne / o ratio is always less than unity : bobn1  is unique , and either shows the result of a rather unusual event , or traces evolution within a rare parameter range like mass and/or metallicity .",
    "the intershell contains the ashes of the preceding hydrogen burning . following helium ignition",
    ", this intershell becomes convective and experiences burning at @xmath102k @xcite .",
    "the nitrogen is burned to @xmath103ne via two @xmath15 captures . in high mass stars ,",
    "hot bottom burning destroys the neon , but in low - mass stars this does not occur and neon increases to @xmath104 by mass @xcite .    intershell material is usually exposed only in hydrogen - poor stars , which are likely to have lost their hydrogen layer in a very late thermal pulse .",
    "these show significant enhancement in ne @xcite , in two cases also with low o / ne .",
    "interestingly , the two cases with low o / ne also show surface hydrogen , although still with h / he@xmath105 by mass .",
    "bobn1  shows no evidence for hydrogen depletion , or of a separate hydrogen - poor region , and is therefore probably not related to the hydrogen - poor stars .",
    "its intershell products instead are visible due to dredge - up .",
    "the neon abundance in bobn1  is about 0.15%  by mass , compared to 2%  expected in the intershell .",
    "this suggests dilution by a factor of 15 . assuming an intershell mass of @xmath106m@xmath107 @xcite we find that the envelope mass at the time of the mixing would have been @xmath108 . assuming an initial metallicity of the envelope of 0.01z@xmath107 , we find that the final surface abundances of c , n , o , ne are dominated by the intershell products , while the helium abundance remains dominated by the original envelope .",
    "this can consistently explain the observed abundances .",
    "the c / o ratio in the intershell is @xmath109 @xcite , which approaches the value seen in bobn1 .",
    "the first scientific results based on salt observations were published by @xcite and @xcite , based on imaging data . in this paper",
    "we present the first spectrophotometric results obtained with salt and rss during their performance verification phase that emphasize the long - slit capabilities of the rss for spectrophotometric observations .",
    "the quality of our data permits us to measure line ratios of elements not accessible in earlier studies .",
    "we measured the electron temperatures , the electron densities and element abundances for o , n , ne , ar , s , cl , fe , c and he elements in two pne in the sagittarius dsph galaxy .",
    "these results are presented in several tables and plots .",
    "based on the data and discussion presented in the paper , the following conclusions can be drawn :    \\1 .",
    "we confirm that stwr2 - 21  is the most metal - rich pn known in any dwarf spheroidal galaxies and has an oxygen abundance of 12+log(o / h ) = 8.57@xmath30.02 dex .",
    "this [ o / h ] shows that sgr contains a younger stellar population with [ fe / h]@xmath110 , in good agreement with spectroscopic abundance measurements in sgr stars .",
    "the element abundance ratios of ne , s , ar and cl to o for stwr2 - 21  are consistent with the expected patterns in regions showing absence of any additional enrichment in oxygen in the pn progenitor .",
    "the lack of nitrogen enrichment puts a lower limit to the age of pn progenitor @xmath97 .",
    "we obtain an oxygen abundance of 12+log(o / h ) = 7.81@xmath30.09 for bobn1 . according to our analysis",
    ", this value should be corrected downward by 1.09@xmath30.13 dex due to the self - pollution of oxygen by the pne progenitor .",
    "after this correction the element abundance ratios s / o , ar / o and cl / o appear in a good overall accord with the trends seen for hii regions .",
    "this implies that the pn progenitor had an oxygen abundance of 12+log(o / h ) = 6.72@xmath30.16 dex , or 1/110 of the solar value , similar to the metallicity of the old globular cluster terzan 8 in sgr @xcite .",
    "bobn1  is therefore one of the most metal - poor pne with well - determined abundances and belongs to the old population of sgr .",
    "during its normal stellar evolution , the pn progenitor enriched the material by a factor of @xmath4  12 in oxygen and by a factor of @xmath4  240 in nitrogen .",
    "bobn1  shows a very unusual pattern with neon being more abundant by number than oxygen .",
    "this neon enrichment could be explained by production of neon in the intershell of low - mass agb stars . in this case",
    "the final surface abundances of c , n , o , ne are dominated by the intershell products , that can consistently explain the observed abundances .",
    "we confirm the existence of wolf - rayet broad lines in stwr2 - 21 , but no wr features were detected in the spectrum of bobn1 .",
    "the fraction of [ wr]-type central pne stars is 67% for dsph galaxies , that supports models in which the probability of star to develop a wr wind is determined by parameters of the progenitor star .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for comments which improved the presentation of the manuscript .",
