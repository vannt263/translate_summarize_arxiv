    "a major goal of observational cosmology is to understand the star formation history of the universe from the earliest epoch of structure formation to the present .",
    "much recent attention has focused on determining the contribution to the global history from the most distant sources ; however , the star formation history even at modest redshifts ( @xmath8 ) is not well determined and has recently undergone a revision",
    ".    early work by ( 1996 ) ( later updated by madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1998 ) suggested that the global star formation as seen in the optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) had a strong peak around @xmath9 and then fell very steeply at lower redshifts .",
    "the @xmath8 data used in the analysis were taken from a paper by lilly et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who used rest - frame near - uv luminosities derived from the @xmath10-selected canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs , 1995 ) to determine the comoving uv luminosity density from @xmath9 to the present .",
    "these authors found the evolution to be a steep function of the form @xmath11 .",
    "however , when ( 1998 ) presented the first uv - selected constraints on the local integrated luminosity density , they found that their result was well above the optically - derived estimates .",
    "( 2000 ) subsequently tripled the uv - selected sample and confirmed the higher local volume - averaged star formation rate .",
    "cowie , songaila , & barger ( 1999 , hereafter csb ) decided to reinvestigate the rest - frame uv luminosity density evolution to @xmath9 using a large , extremely deep , and highly complete spectroscopic galaxy redshift survey .",
    "their data enabled them to select objects based on the rest - frame uv magnitudes at all redshifts .",
    "the evolution found by these authors was a much shallower function of the form @xmath12 .",
    "csb suggested that the differences between their results and those of lilly et  al . could be accounted for by the @xmath10-band selection of the lilly et  al",
    ". sample , which required large extrapolations to obtain uv colors , and by the cfrs data not being deep enough to probe the flat segments of the luminosity function ( lf ) , which meant that at redshifts near @xmath9 , reliable extrapolations to total luminosity density could not be made .    in this paper",
    ", we expand on the work of csb to more thoroughly investigate the rest - frame uv luminosity density evolution from @xmath0 to the present .",
    "our new galaxy sample is nearly twice as large as that used by csb , and we explore various methods for constructing the uv lfs .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] we present our data sample and strategy and we investigate the @xmath1  number counts and redshift distribution .",
    "we also explore the redshift - magnitude relationship for the @xmath1 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 passbands . in   [ sec : uvlf ] we describe how we construct rest - frame uv lfs as a function of redshift from the @xmath1 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 data . in   [ sec : ld ] we utilize these lfs to infer the evolution of the global uv luminosity density with redshift . in   [ sec : conc ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "initially , we assume a flat lambda ( @xmath6 ) cosmology with @xmath15 h  @xmath16 .",
    "subsequently , we investigate the effect of an einstein - de sitter ( @xmath17 ) cosmology on our results .",
    "we analyzed a three passband subset ( @xmath1  ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) of an ongoing eight passband ( @xmath1 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath19 , @xmath10 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) hawaii imaging survey of four @xmath23 areas crossing the hawaii survey fields ssa13 , ssa17 , and ssa22 ( lilly , cowie , & gardner 1991 ) and the hubble deep field ( hdf ) ( williams et  al . 1996 ) .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath14 images were obtained using the low - resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; oke et  al .",
    "1995 ) on the keck  10  m telescopes and the uh8k ccd mosaic camera ( luppino 1997 ) on the canada - france - hawaii 3.6  m telescope .",
    "the @xmath1  data were taken with the orbit ccd on the university of hawaii 2.2  m telescope .",
    "all magnitudes were measured in 3@xmath24  diameter apertures and corrected to total magnitudes following the procedures described in cowie et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "the sources analyzed in this paper contain and extend the csb catalogs . the total number of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the present @xmath1 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 samples are 403 , 414 , and 518 , all to a survey limit magnitude ( ab ) of @xmath25 .",
    "these numbers can be compared to those in csb ( 218 , 350 , and 259 respectively ) .",
    "thus , our current dataset contains approximately double the number of objects in the csb @xmath1  and @xmath14 samples .",
    "the great advantage of multiband data is that one can , for all redshifts , select galaxies based on their rest - frame uv magnitudes , thereby avoiding the uncertainties associated with selecting galaxies at longer ( redder ) wavelengths and then extrapolating to obtain their uv magnitudes .",
    "in addition , the depth of the current dataset allows us to construct lfs to sufficiently faint absolute magnitudes to constrain the faint - end slope .",
    "moreover , by selecting galaxies based on their rest - frame uv magnitudes , we expect the relative shape of the inferred uv lfs to be minimally sensitive to the effect of interstellar dust ; i.e. ,  we expect the relative forms of our derived lfs ( and hence the relative values of our luminosity densities ) to be subject only to evolution in the amount or properties of galactic dust with redshift and not to its effect in absolute terms .",
    "( note that any extinction due to dust in the source galaxy should not be confused with the tiny extinction corrections due to interstellar dust )    as discussed in csb , one is free to choose the rest - frame wavelength at which to compute lfs and the uv light density . for our dataset ,",
    "2500    provides a sensible compromise between our wide range of redshifts and large number of galaxies in each passband .",
    "because there are missing or unidentified galaxies in each sample , we construct lfs by either omitting them ( i.e. ,  we assume they are unidentified because they are unusual in some way , e.g. , at very high redshift ) , or by assuming they are distributed in redshift in exactly the same manner as the identified galaxies ( i.e. ,  we assume they are identical to the measured galaxies but have been missed for some trivial reason ) .",
    "it is likely that the true lf lies between these two possibilities . in subsequent sections we refer to the former case as minimal and the latter case as incompleteness - corrected .",
    "the @xmath1 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 samples are @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 complete , respectively , so the correction is not a huge factor in any case .",

    "1998 ; gardner , brown , & ferguson 2000 ) have measured deep galaxy counts at 3000    from the _ hst _ hubble deep field imaging survey , but their counts are somewhat deeper than those presented here , so it is difficult to make a direct comparison .",

    "the availability of both multicolor data and highly complete spectroscopy enabled us to select galaxies based on their rest - frame ultraviolet color , minimizing potential sources of error such as large @xmath108-corrections and interstellar dust .",
    "our large , deep sample allowed us to constrain the faint - end of the luminosity function with confidence , even at the highest redshift interval of @xmath264 . assuming analytic schechter forms for our luminosity functions and using likely extremal faint - end slope values of @xmath217 and @xmath218 , we constrained the _ relative _ luminosity density as a function of redshift .",
    "we concluded that , in an @xmath6 [ einstein - de sitter ] universe , the evolution in the luminosity density follows a @xmath5 [ @xmath7 ] slope from @xmath0 to the present , implying that rather more star formation has occurred in recent times than was previously suggested .",
