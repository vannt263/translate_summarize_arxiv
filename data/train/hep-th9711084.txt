    "nonperturbative treatments are essential .",
    "one of the simplest nonperturbative techniques is the @xmath2-expansion scheme which works well in the four - fermion models .    in the simplest version of the njl model @xcite ( or four - fermion model ) the chiral symmetry of the theory",
    "is spontaneously broken according to the emergence of a vacuum condensate of the composite field of fermions @xmath4 : @xmath5 . at the same time",
    "the non - vanishing fermion mass is generated . in the spectrum",
    "one finds a mode of the composite scalar field : @xmath6 , which may correspond to the higgs field in the theory with the elementary higgs scalar field .",
    "clearly the model may be regarded as a composite higgs model based on the mechanism of dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "four - fermion models ( gauged four - fermion models ) have been often considered as an effective low energy theory for quantum chromodynamics ( qcd , see ref .",
    "@xcite for an introduction ) .",
    "the chiral symmetry of such a theory is broken by the creation of quark - anti - quark condensates and quark masses are dynamically generated .",
    "such a theory is extremely useful in dealing with non - perturvative phenomena of qcd .",
    "moreover the ( gauged ) four - fermion models may be well applied to the description of the dynamical symmetry breaking in standard model ( sm ) . at the electroweak scale",
    "the dynamical symmetry breaking may be caused by the fundamental fermion condensate as in the technicolor model.@xcite the similar mechanism could work in the symmetry breaking at the gut era in early universe .",
    "the description of elementary particle theories ( qcd , sm , gut , @xmath7 ) in terms of the effective four - fermion model is particularly convenient when the theories are considered under some external conditions ( finite temperature , finite density , non - trivial topology , external gauge and gravitational fields , etc . ) .",
    "as an extreme external condition one immediately considers the early universe where the gravity is strong and the temperature is high . since the dynamical symmetry breaking mechanism replaces the spontaneous symmetry breaking caused by the elementary higgs scalar field , it is natural for us to employ the composite field @xmath8 as an inflaton in the inflationary universe.@xcite through renormalization group arguments @xcite one finds the necessity of the scalar - gravitational non - minimal coupling @xmath9 @xcite whose value is governed by the renormalization group running .",
    "the value of @xmath9 varies in different theories and is crucial to have a successful inflation .",
    "one realizes an importance of studying the phase structure of the four - fermion model in curved background and finds the cosmological motivation to deal with this model .",
    "the main purpose of the present article is to present what is and is not established in the study of the four - fermion models in curved spacetime in full detail .",
    "we do not consider in the present article any cosmological applications .",

    " 2 fundamental properties of four - fermion models are briefly reviewed . to investigate the phase structure of the four - fermion theory the effective potential",

    "we adopt the @xmath2 expansion method as a nonperturbative approach and calculate the effective potential in the leading order of the @xmath2 expansion . as an instructive rehearsal we work in the minkowski spacetime and",
    "evaluate the effective potential analytically as well as numerically . on the basis of the effective potential we discuss the phase structure of the four - fermion model in the minkowski spacetime .    in  3",
    "the weakly curved spacetime is considered .",
    "we keep only terms independent of and linear in the curvature . evaluating the effective potential in the leading order of @xmath2 expansion the phase structure of the theory",
    "is clarified and the curvature - induced phase transition is discussed in arbitrary dimensions ( @xmath1 ) .    in  4 we consider the spacetimes with the constant curvature ( de sitter background , anti - de sitter background and einstein universe background ) . in these spacetimes we can evaluate the effective potential of the four - fermion model without making any approximation with regard to the curvature . with the aim of justifying the validity of the weak curvature approximation",
    "we investigate the phase structure in the constant curvature spacetime .",
    "we then compare the result with the one in the weakly curved spacetime .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the study of the gauged njl model , supersymmetric njl model and higher derivative four - fermion model in the weakly curved spacetime .",
    "we evaluate the effective potential in the gauged njl model with finite cut - off and let the cut - off tend to infinity . in order to do",
    "so we use the renormalization group method and appeal to the equivalence with the gauge higgs - yukawa model .",
    "the analytical form of the condition for the chiral symmetry breaking is found .",

    "the effective potential is evaluated at finite temperature in spacetimes with positive or negative curvature .",
    "for sufficiently high temperature we show that the broken chiral symmetry is restored and the symmetric phase can be realized even in the spacetime with negative curvature .    in  7",
    "we discuss the influence of the non - trivial topology to the chiral symmetry breaking in the weakly curved spacetime .",
    "we start with the calculation of the effective potential in the four - fermion model in the flat torus - compactified spacetime .",
    "we find the same quantity as in the weakly curved spacetime with the torus - compactified dimension .",
    "the possibility of curvature and topology - induced phase transition is explicitly shown .",

    "thus the effective equations also contain an imaginary part .",

    "it is interesting that one can easily obtain the effective action in @xmath10 supergravity in flat spacetime using the effective action ( [ 849 ] ) and ( [ 852 ] ) .",
    "this effective action also contains an imaginary part for all @xmath8 .",
    "thus , we found the effective action for composite gravitino in @xmath10 supergravity and discussed its properties .    in summary , in the present section",
    "the use of four - fermion type models in the theories of quantum gravity has been discussed .",
    "few particular examples presented here indicate that four - fermion models could find wider applications than it is usually believed .",
    "in the present paper we discussed four - fermion models in an external gravitational field . as is well - known these models are extremely useful for analytical study of dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "our main purpose was to investigate the influence of the external gravitational field to dynamical symmetry breaking .    using @xmath2-expansion and working in the leading order of this expansion we calculated the effective potential in four - fermion models in @xmath0-dimensional spacetime ( @xmath12 ) for a variety of backgrounds .",
    "in particular , we considered the class of spacetimes where derivative expansion maybe applied . here the effective potential for the composite operator @xmath3 has been calculated taking into account terms linear on curvature .",
    "we also evaluated the effective potential on the background with constant curvature ; minkowski space , de sitter background , anti - de sitter background and einstein universe .",
    "in all these cases an external curvature has been taken into account exactly .",
    "phase structure of the effective potential has been carefully studied using analytical and numerical methods .",
    "the possibility of chiral symmetry breaking due to curvature effects and curvature - induced phase transitions has been discussed in all detail .",
    "the phase diagrams for dynamically generated fermion mass have been constructed .",
    "for example , for negative curvature chiral symmetry is always broken down .",
    "similar questions have been addressed for the extensions of four - fermion models ; higher derivative four - fermion model and gauged njl model . in particular , for gauged njl model ( which may play the role of sm or gut without elementary scalars ) the technique of renormalization group improvement has been applied .",
    "the effective potential equivalent to schwinger - dyson approach has been found analytically .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking has been estimated .",
    "we also discuss the combined influence of two effects ( non - trivial topology and external curvature , non - vanishing magnetic field and external curvature ) to phase structure of four - fermion model .",
    "the effective potential has again been calculated for few specific backgrounds .",
    "phase structure has been analyzed .",
    "in particular we found that in some case two external effects ( for example , magnetic field and gravitational field ) may compensate each other .",
    "that leads to the restoration of chiral symmetry , which was originally broken .",
    "we presented the number of examples where an analytical study of composite states is possible even in the presence of non - trivial gravitational background .",
    "having in mind the cosmological applications , it is straitforward now to use the effective potential obtained above for the construction of inflationary universe where the role of inflaton will be played by a composite state of fermion fields.@xcite    in our calculation we limited ourselves to case of weakly curved or constant curvature spacetimes . in this case",
    "the effective action is reduced to the effective potential except for the volume factor . however , for more general backgrounds one has to calculate the effective action in four - fermion models .",
    "it is expected that instabilities ( due to creation of instanton - antiinstanton condensation ) may appear in such situation . that may completely change the phase structure of the theory .",
    "such an extremely hard task as the calculation of effective action on general curved background is quite natural extension of the presented results .",
    "another very interesting line of research is related with the study of realistic model of elementary particles in the early universe .",
    "one can start from some gut scenarios which maybe reformulated as gauged four - fermion model in the same way as the model of  5.1 .",
    "then , the role of gravitational background to phase transitions maybe discussed in all detail , even in non - perturbative regime .    note also that methods developed in the present paper maybe applied to other theories .",
    "for example , in supergravities one can study the effective potential of composite gravitino ( see  9.3 ) , for gauge theories one can study the effective potential for composite vectors @xcite and so on .",
    "it is interesting to note also that above approach maybe well extended to supersymmetric theories .",
    "for example , in  5.3 we discussed supersymmetric njl model in curved spacetime and found the possibility of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking due to gravitational effects",
    ".    it would be also extremely interesting to analyze the next - to - leading corrections to effective potential of four - fermion model on curved background .",
    "such multi - loop calculations may clarify the phase structure in many cases when the creation of multi - critical points is possible .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that in realistic situation ( like early universe ) the combination of few external effects maybe quite natural .",
    "hence , it could be interesting to study phase structure of four - fermion model in curved spacetime with finite temperature,@xcite magnetic field , chemical potential and non - trivial topology .",

    "<S> this review deals with the theory of four - fermion interactions in curved spacetime . starting with the @xmath0-dimensional minkowski spacetime ( @xmath1 ) the effective potential in the leading order of @xmath2-expansion is calculated and the phase structure of the theory </S>",
    "<S> is investigated . using the same technique the effective potential for composite operator @xmath3 in four - fermion models </S>",
    "<S> is calculated under the following circumstances :    \\a ) @xmath0-dimensional weakly curved spacetime ( in linear curvature approximation ) ,    \\b ) @xmath0-dimensional de sitter and anti - de sitter universe ,    \\c ) @xmath0-dimensional einstein universe .    </S>",
    "<S> the phase structure of the theory is investigated analytically as well as numerically . </S>",
    "<S> curvature induced phase transitions are discussed where fermion masses are dynamically generated .    as an extension of four - fermion models we consider the gauged nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , higher derivative njl model and supersymmetric njl model in weakly curved spacetime where the effective potential is analytically evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> the phase structure of the models is again analyzed and the condition for the chiral symmetry breaking in the gauged njl model is given in an analytical form .    finally the influence of two external effects ( non - zero temperature and gravitational field , non - trivial topology and gravitational field as well as magnetic and gravitational field ) to the phase structure of four - fermion models is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of curvature and temperature - induced or curvature- and topology - induced phase transitions is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it is also argued that the chiral symmetry broken by a weak magnetic field may be restored due to the presence of gravitational field . </S>",
    "<S> some applications of four - fermion models in quantum gravity are also briefly investigated .    </S>",
