    "regular studies of by dra ( gl 719 , hd 234677 , hip 91009 , nltt 46684 , bd+51 2402 ) started in mid 40 s when mnch noted the calcium h and k lines to be in emission @xcite .",
    "this fact was later confirmed by @xcite who also noted strong emission balmer series lines . in one of his spectrograms",
    "the emission was particularly strong which led to a conclusion that by dra may be a member of a new group of flare stars @xcite .",
    "photometric monitoring was then carried out ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but the variability was not confirmed until 1966 when chugainov obtained a quasi - sinusoidal light curve with an amplitude of 0.23 mag and a period of 3.826 d @xcite , later interpreted as a rotation of a spotted star @xcite .",
    "no flares were then observed .",
    "the first photometric flares were reported by @xcite who later observed twelve flares that occurred between july 1967 and july 1970 @xcite .",
    "@xcite confirmed the sinusoidal variability with a @xmath43.826 d period and noted the variation of its amplitude .",
    "many subsequent studies of by dra s variability have been carried out and the most up - to - date value of the rotational period @xmath5 d is given by @xcite as an average period for their entire 1965 - 1989 data set .",
    "the double - lined spectroscopic nature was revealed by @xcite .",
    "they announced a period of 5.981  d but never published their full orbital solution .",
    "it was done later by @xcite on the basis of 23 spectra taken between june 1966 and july 1971 at the hale and mcdonald observatories , 15 of which showed unblended ca ii h and k lines .",
    "@xcite also performed an analysis of the spots on the surface of by dra and estimated the rotational velocity of the primary ( spotted ) component to be @xmath45 km s@xmath6 and the ( rotational ) inclination to be @xmath430 deg . since then by dra became a prototype of a new class of stars characterized by a late type , brightness variation caused by spots , rapid rotation and strong emission in h and k lines .",
    "the short orbital period also seems to be a characteristic for most of by dra - type stars @xcite .",
    "the orbital solution was later improved by @xcite on the basis of high - resolution reticon spectra .",
    "@xcite also found the projected rotational velocity of the primary to be 8.5 km s@xmath6 under the assumption of the rotational inclination being the same as the orbital one ( spin - orbit alignment ) .",
    "they estimated the radius of the primary to be greater than 0.9 r@xmath7 which led to a conclusion that by dra was a pre - main - sequence system .",
    "this conclusion was supported by the large brightness ratio despite the mass ratio being close to 1 ( @xmath8 ) , the barnes - evans visual surface brightness relation @xcite and the inequality of the rotational and orbital periods .",
    "however , the assumption of the spin - orbit alignment in close binary systems was later criticized in several works , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the orbital parameters as well as the value of the projected rotational velocities for both components were shortly after improved by @xcite .",
    "they used new measurements from coravel and obtained rotational velocities @xmath9 and @xmath10 km s@xmath6 and the mass ratio @xmath11 = 0.89 significantly more different from 1 than that of @xcite .",
    "they also estimated the magnitude difference ( 1.15 mag ) and the primary s radius ( 1.2 - 1.4 r@xmath7 ) but noted that a higher macroturbulence velocity would reduce the radius estimation by a factor of 2 .",
    "the most up - to - date spectroscopic orbital solution was given together with the first astrometric solution by @xcite .",
    "they combined the archival rv measurements with the visibility based ( @xmath12 ) astrometric measurements obtained with the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ; * ? ? ? * ) in 1999 .",
    "their orbital inclination ( 152 deg , retrograde orbit ) agrees with the first estimations of the rotational inclination @xcite but not with the later ones @xcite .",
    "finally it is worth noting that by dra is a hierarchical multiple system .",
    "a common proper - motion companion was found by @xcite about 16.7 arc - sec to the northeast of the primary . from the visual and infrared photometry of by dra c they also deduced that this component is a normal m5 dwarf at least @xmath13 yr old which makes the pre - main - sequence nature of by dra less probable .",
    "yet another putative component is reported in the _ hipparcos _ double and multiple system annex @xcite .",
    "a photocentric circular orbital solution with a period of 114 d and 113 deg inclination is reported .",
    "@xcite however demonstrated that this is an improbable solution since the 4-th body would produce significant perturbations to the by dra ab radial velocities but no such periodicity is seen in the archival rvs .",
    "we spectroscopically observed by dra over the years 2004 - 2008 using a combination of high resolution echelle spectrographs hires ( 10-m keck i ) , sarg ( 3.5-m tng ) and hamspec ( 3-m shane telescope ) as a part of our ongoing rv search for circumbinary planets @xcite .",
    "even though we knew that by dra was too variable to allow us reach an rv precision sufficient to detect planets , it was nevertheless observed to make use of an extensive and publicly available set of pti @xmath12 measurements spanning now over 8 years .    in this paper",
    "we present a new orbital solution and the orbital and physical parameters of the by  dra  ab binary , derived with a precision of over an order of magnitude better than by @xcite .",
    "thanks to our superior iodine - cell - based radial velocities and the full set of pti visibilities we are able to put strong constraints on the nature of the system . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we present the data  @xmath12s and rvs . in section 4",
    "we describe their modeling .",
    "the results of our data modeling are presented in section 5 and the state of by dra is then discussed in section 6 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results of our modeling are collected in tables [ tab_orb ] and [ tab_phys ] .",
    "figure [ rvs ] shows our rvs together with the best fitting orbital solution and the corresponding residuals and their histograms .",
    "figure [ vis ] shows the same for the pti @xmath12 measurements .",
    "the resulting astrometric orbit of component b relative to a is shown in the panel ( d ) . in table [ tab_orb ] we show the orbital parameters for by dra , the velocity offsets and other parameters related to the quality of the fit .",
    "the absolute physical parameters are listed in table [ tab_phys ] .",
    "as one can see , we were able to reach @xmath40.2 % of precision in velocity amplitudes , despite such obstacles like the presence of spots or some rotational broadening of spectral lines .",
    "this level of quality has direct implication for the precision of mass ratio @xmath11 ( 0.28 % ) , @xmath14 ( 0.44 and 0.46 % for the primary and secondary respectively ) or major semi - axis ( @xmath40.2 % both for the apparent and absolute values ) .",
    "the level of precision in @xmath15 also proves that the quality of the astrometric solution is very high .",
    "the 299 visibility measurements used provide good orbital phase coverage .",
    "the apparent and physical values of major semi - axis allow us to determine the parallax , thus the distance to the system , with a precision also close to 0.2 % . our value of the parallax ",
    "60.43(12 ) mas  is in a relatively good agreement but almost 6 times more precise than 61.15(68 ) mas from the new reduction of the _ hipparcos _ data @xcite .",
    "we were also able to precisely derive the magnitude difference in the @xmath16 band ( 282 @xmath12 measurements ) but the accuracy for the @xmath17 band is much lower due to a lower number of @xmath12 measurements in @xmath17 ( only 17 ) .",
    "our final error in the absolute masses of the by dra components is however much higher  3.3 % for both the primary and secondary .",
    "this is mainly due to the inclination of the orbit of 154.4 deg . for such configurations ,",
    "far from edge - on , a small error in the angle propagates to a large error in the masses .",
    "still it is a considerably more accurate measurement compared to @xcite of respectively 23% and 25% for the primary and secondary .",
    "this is possible thanks to our superior rv data set ( rms of @xmath40.15 km s@xmath6 vs 2.3 km s@xmath6 ) and a longer time span of the astrometric @xmath12 data .",
    "as it is pointed out by @xcite , the mass uncertainty should be below 3 % to be useful to perform reliable tests of the stellar evolution models .",
    "our precision is close to that but to go below 3 % we would require a higher number of precise rvs or more @xmath12 measurements .",
    "nevertheless , with our measurements we still can place some constraints on the evolutionary properties of by dra .",
    "we focused on the age estimation to confirm or exclude the pre - main - sequence nature of the system .",
    "we compared our results with the yonsei - yale isochrones ( y@xmath18 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we used our estimations of the magnitude differences , parallax and the apparent @xmath17 and @xmath16 magnitude from 2mass @xcite to derive the absolute @xmath17 and @xmath16 magnitudes of each component separately . using the transformation equations from ( * ? ? ? * with updates)jmc/2mass / v3/transformations/ ] we transformed them to the eso photometric system @xcite , in which the y@xmath18 isochrones are available . in figure [ fig_iso ]",
    "we show our measurements in the mass/@xmath16-band ( left ) and mass/@xmath17-band ( right ) absolute magnitude diagrams .",
    "for comparison we plot the isochrones for ages of 60  myr ( dashed ) and 1  gyr ( solid lines ) for three values of the metallicity : @xmath19 = 0.02 ( red ) , 0.04 ( green ) and 0.06 ( blue ) .",
    "one can see that the properties of the secondary component are not reproduced by the 60  myr isochrones , which means that it has already settled down on the main sequence .",
    "the formally best match is found for @xmath20 gyr and @xmath21 .",
    "no match was found for ages below 60 myr for any @xmath19 value nor for any age value for @xmath22 . for @xmath23 gyr",
    "only isochrones with metallicities higher than solar reproduce the data points .",
    "we thus conclude that by  dra is probably between 0.2 and 5 gyr old and is more metal - rich than the sun .",
    "the most probable values of age and @xmath19 are 1 - 2 gyr and 0.04 respectively these facts make the pre - main - sequence scenario less probable .    one should notice that the error bars in the masses are enlarged mainly by the uncertainty in the inclination .",
    "any change in @xmath24 would shift both components in the same direction  towards higher or lower masses which would definitely not improve the fit .",
    "we also have a large uncertainty in @xmath25 , induced by the error in @xmath26 , which is so large due to a small number of @xmath12 measurements in this band .",
    "reduction of this uncertainty would allow for putting even more stringent constrains on the nature of the system .",
    "at the same time , @xmath27 is very well constrained and shows that the mass ratio @xmath28 is not inconsistent with the observed flux ratio , at least in the k band . using the y@xmath18 set of isochrones we can estimate that the expected theoretical magnitude difference in @xmath29 for the stars having 0.792 and 0.697 m@xmath30 , should be close to 0.9 mag .",
    "this is not in agreement with @xmath31 mag predicted by @xcite .",
    "however given even @xmath40.2 mag variation from spots @xcite , we can conclude that such a difference in v is possible for by dra even if it is a main - sequence system .    to put additional constrains on the system s age , we further calculated the galactic space velocities @xmath32 , @xmath29 and @xmath33 indicate velocities toward the galactic center , direction of rotation and north pole respectively ] relatively to the local standard of rest ( lsr ; * ? ? ?",
    "we applied our values of radial systemic velocity and distance estimation together with proper motion of @xmath34 mas  yr@xmath6 and @xmath35 mas  yr@xmath6 from the ppmx catalogue @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38  km  s@xmath6 put by  dra outside of any known young moving group or group candidate @xcite , and at the transition area between the thin and thick galactic disk @xcite .",
    "this supports the possibility of by  dra being not a pms system .",
    "best - matching isochrone .",
    "horizontal solid lines represent our estimations of the masses and the dashed lines the 1-sigma ranges of their respective uncertainties . ]    using the masses and isochrones , we can estimate the radii of each component of by dra . in figure",
    "[ fig_rpred ] we plot the y@xmath18 isochrone for 1 gyr and @xmath39 in a radius / mass plane . as solid horizontal lines we plot the masses together with their uncertainties ( dashed lines ) .",
    "other probable isochrones are very close to the chosen one and do not change the results of our analysis significantly .",
    "our results predict values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 r@xmath30 .",
    "we can use this together with the rotational velocities and rotational period values from the literature to estimate the orbital inclination angles .",
    "for this purpose we use @xmath42 and @xmath43 km s@xmath6 from @xcite and @xmath44 d from @xcite .",
    "this implies @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "most of the authors attribute spots to the primary component and refer the @xmath43.8 d period to its rotation .",
    "if so , from the values above we can estimate the rotational inclination of the primary to be @xmath47 or @xmath48 deg .",
    "if we assume the secondary to rotate with the given period , we end up with @xmath49 or 113 deg and its uncertainties ranging from 50 to 130 deg .",
    "this means that @xmath50 deg is also possible .",
    "our results are in a good agreement with values given by @xcite who derived @xmath51 and @xmath52 deg .",
    "none of the values however agrees with the orbital inclination @xmath53 deg .",
    "this indicates the spin - orbit misalignment in the by dra system .",
    "even if we consider that the theoretical radii are underestimated by about 15% , a well known issue for late - type stars , we are not able to reproduce the observed @xmath54 .    in the case of a spin - orbit alignment , and the literature values of @xmath55",
    ", the radii would have to be @xmath56 and @xmath57 r@xmath30 .",
    "this would occur if the system was @xmath43 - 4 myr old , depending on the metallicity .",
    "in such a case both stars should be much brighter in the infrared than it is observed .",
    "the predicted @xmath16-magnitudes difference for the two stars would be @xmath40.2 and not 0.53 mag which is observed .",
    "one also would expect the system to be a member of a young cluster , containing leftovers of the primodial gas , but this is not observed as well .",
    "however , the spin - orbit alignment should be observed for such a close pair of @xmath41 gyr old stars @xcite .",
    "the source of the discrepancy could be for example an overestimated rotational velocity .",
    "@xcite in their analysis adopted a value of 3.6  km  s@xmath6 , given by @xcite values from @xcite . ] . for this value of @xmath55",
    "we get @xmath58  deg , which is very close to the observed orbital inclination .",
    "hence the spin - orbit alignment may in fact be present in the by  dra system if @xcite have overestimated their rotational velocity measurements by adopting a too small macroturbulence velocity .",
    "finally , let us note that a spin - orbit misalignment could manifest itself through its impact on the apsidal precession rate ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately since by dra is not an eclipsing system and our rvs and @xmath12s are not sufficiently accurate , a measurement of the apsidal motion can not be carried out .",
    "we attempted to fit for @xmath59 but obtained statistically insignificant value .      in the case of eccentric orbits",
    "one can find a rotational period for which an equilibrium is achieved .",
    "this equilibrium , called the _ pseudo - synchronization _ , occurs when the ratio of the orbital to the rotational period is : @xmath60 @xcite . for the observed eccentricity of by  dra",
    "we get @xmath61 or @xmath62  d , which is in a good agreement with the observed @xmath44  d , and @xmath63 .",
    "one may thus conclude that by  dra is in a rotational equilibrium .",
    "the predicted time scale of the pseudo - synchronization is in the case of by  dra similar but slightly shorter than for the spin - orbit alignment @xcite . using the approximate formula for the synchronization time scale of late - type stars given by @xcite",
    ", we get the value of the order of 10  myr , so still smaller than the age of the system .",
    "the above equation was however derived for binaries with no additional companions ( see below ) and the tidal evolution of by dra ab might be different if the gravitational influence of the third body is taken into account .",
    "the eccentricity of by dra ab ( @xmath1 ) appears to be unusually high .",
    "according to @xcite a circularization of the orbit of a late type system such as by  dra should occur during the pre - main - sequence phase .",
    "this was one of the arguments for the pms nature of by  dra .",
    "based on @xcite we can estimate that in the case of by  dra the eccentricity should drop to a few percent over @xmath64 years .    however , by  dra is a hierarchical triple system , with a distant common proper motion companion .",
    "the projected separation of 16.7 arc - sec and our distance determination indicate a projected physical separation of 277 au . as estimated by @xcite",
    "its mass is about 0.13 m@xmath30 and assuming a circular orbit , it corresponds to an orbital period of about 2050 years .",
    "it is conceivable that the observed eccentricity of the by  dra  ab pair could be explained by the presence of the companion through the mazeh - shaham mechanism which results in a cyclic eccentricity variation , known as the kozai cycles @xcite .",
    "let us denote all the orbital and physical parameters of an unknown perturber by the index @xmath65 .",
    "in order to put some constrains on the properties of the perturber which would induce sufficiently strong kozai cycles , we followed the analysis of @xcite .",
    "the two main conditions which have to be met in order to produce the observed eccentricity are : ( 1 ) a sufficiently large relative inclination @xmath66 of the binary ( inner ) and the perturber s ( outer ) orbit ; ( 2 ) the kozai cycles time - scale @xmath67 must be shorter than the period of the inner orbit s pericenter precession . for the by  dra  ab pair the relativistic precession is the dominant one , being at least an order of magnitude faster than any other ( tidal or rotational ; * ? ? ?",
    "the precession period is @xmath68  yr , which corresponds to @xmath69  rad  s@xmath6 . using the formalism of @xcite we can estimate that the observed eccentricity of by  dra can be induced when @xmath70 ( in si units ) , where the term @xmath71 is computed for @xmath72 . from this we can derive the following conditions for the parameters of the perturbing body : @xmath73 or @xmath74 where the orbital period is given in years , major semi - axis in au and all masses in m@xmath30 .",
    "the condition @xmath70 also allows us to deduce that the relative inclination of the two orbits must be larger than @xmath75 ( or smaller than @xmath76 ) .",
    "this value can be confirmed by the results of @xcite , which for the mass ratio of by  dra  ab predict @xmath77 .",
    "the relatively narrow range of @xmath66 allows us to put some usefull constrains ( which include possible values of the longitudes of ascending nodes ) on the _ absolute _ value of the perturber s orbital inclination : @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "( the lower @xmath79 of the rv orbital solution and half of its value , left and right column respectively ) , and having orbital inclinations of 90 ( top row ) and 52.4@xmath80 ( bottom row ) .",
    "the shaded areas refer to the periods and eccentricities which would not allow to induce sufficiently strong kozai cycles",
    ". the lower limit of the period is 35 d ( the semimajor axis of 0.24 au ) which refers to the shortest stable _ circular _ orbit @xcite .",
    "the area above the solid line corresponds to the eccentric orbits whose periastron distance is within the instability zone ( i.e. is shorter than 0.24 au ) .",
    "the upper limit in the eccentricities shown in the figures is 0.9 . ]     for a putative fourth body estimated from our rv measurements , for several values of eccentricities .",
    "the value of the @xmath81 m s@xmath6 was assumed to be the rv semi - amplitude .",
    "the lower limit of the period is 35 d ( the semimajor axis of 0.24 au ) which refers to the shortest stable _ circular _ orbit @xcite . for eccentric orbits",
    "the limits are terminated at the shortest periods having the distance of periastron larger than 0.24 au ( around 60 , 139 and 1107 days ) . using @xmath82 increases the detection limits by about 26% ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "colour version of the figure is available in the on - line version of the manuscript . ]    in figure [ fig_kozai ] we present results of our analysis .",
    "we use relation [ rel_koz_p ] to check whether a body of a given orbital properties ( i.e. period and eccentricity ) can produce sufficient kozai cycles . for the mass @xmath84",
    "we have taken mass of a body that in an orbit of a given @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 or 90@xmath80 would produce an rv modulation of the inner pair at the level of the smaller @xmath79 ( 157 m s@xmath6 ) or half of that .",
    "the four panels show the @xmath88 parameter space for the two values of inclinations and rv semi - amplitudes .",
    "the shaded areas correspond to the values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 for which the observed eccentricity of by  dra  ab would not be induced .",
    "the solid line shows the short - period stability border , calculated in such way that for a given eccentricity the orbit has its periastron at @xmath40.24 au which refers to the smallest stable _ circular _ orbit ( with @xmath89 d ; * ? ? ?",
    "the long - period cut - off at 2900 days is mainly for the clarity , but it is close to double time span of our observations ( 1513  d ) which means that rv modulations with periods around 3000 d could in principle be detected .",
    "the corresponding fourth body detection limits in terms of @xmath90 as a function of its orbital period and eccentricity are presented in the figure [ fig_detect ] .    from those two figures",
    "one can deduce that if the observed eccentricity is an effect of the mazeh - shaham mechanism , the perturber should be in an orbit of up to single years ( major semi axes from @xmath91 to @xmath92 au ) and have its mass in the planetary regime .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the interferometric @xmath12 measurements are fully - consistent with a two - disc model , so no additional light is detected .",
    "it is not however excluded that the eccentricity of the perturber is very large which would allow more massive bodies in long period orbits to induce the kozai cycles and remain undetectable by the rvs .",
    "the component c discovered by @xcite could be the perturbing body but with the relation [ rel_koz_a ] it seems that it is not very likely .",
    "for the estimated mass @xmath93 m@xmath30 the orbital eccentricity @xmath94 would have to be larger than 0.98 , assuming a fortunate but improbable case that the star is currently seen exactly at the apocenter , and @xmath95 , thus @xmath96 [ au ] @xmath97 .",
    "for less fortunate cases the value of @xmath94 would have to be even larger .",
    "the other possibility is the presence of a putative fourth body reported in the _ hipparcos _ catalog .",
    "@xcite inspected the available rv data in order to find a 114 day period predicted by the _",
    "hipparcos _ catalog and with a high level of confidence they excluded the existence of such a period in the spectroscopic data . with the relation [ rel_koz_p ]",
    "we can show that if a body in a @xmath98 d circular orbit exists , it would have to have @xmath99 m@xmath100 . from the figure [ fig_detect ] we can put an upper mass limit of 5.44 m@xmath100 , taking into account the reported inclination of 113.21@xmath80 , which itself is within the allowed limits .",
    "the reported major semi - axis of the _ hipparcos _ photocentric orbital solution is @xmath101 au ( at the distance to by  dra ) . assuming the maximum mass ratio @xmath102 , the 4-th body barycentric major semi - axis would be 16.07 au ( after correcting for the inclination ) , but the kepler s 3rd law predicts the major semi - axis of 0.53 au for the given period and masses .",
    "such a body would produce the rv signal much stronger than 157 m s@xmath6 .",
    "we can thus conclude that the _ hipparcos _ solution is unrealistic .",
    "we present the most precise orbital and physical parameters of an important astrophysical object  the low - mass sb2 by  draconis , a prototype of an entire class of variable stars .",
    "we reach a level of precision which allows us to put important constrains on the nature of this object .",
    "we conclude that this is not a pre - main - sequence system , despite its high orbital eccentricity and a possible spin - orbit misalignment .",
    "however , the gravitational influence of a 4-th , yet undetected body in the system may explain the observed value of @xmath103 and the spin - orbit alignment may be inferred from the available data if a smaller than claimed in the literature value of the rotational velocity is used .",
    "the observed rotational period and the eccentricity suggest that the by dra ab system is in the rotational equilibrium .",
    "however , if the observed eccentricity is indeed due to the presence of the 4-th body , the putatiuve companion may have its mass in the planetary regime .",
    "the whole dynamical and tidal picture of this system is more complicated than we previoulsy thought and deserving perhaps a dedicated theoretical , observational and numerical analysis .",

    "<S> we present the most precise to date orbital and physical parameters of the well known short period ( @xmath0 d ) , eccentric ( @xmath1 ) double - lined spectroscopic binary by draconis , a prototype of a class of late - type , active , spotted flare stars . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the full spectroscopic / astrometric orbital solution by combining our precise radial velocities ( rvs ) and the archival astrometric measurements from the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rvs were derived based on the high resolution echelle spectra taken between 2004 and 2008 with the keck  i / hires , shane / cat / hamspec and tng / sarg telescopes / spectrographs using our novel iodine - cell technique for double - lined binary stars . </S>",
    "<S> the rvs and available pti astrometric data spanning over 8 years allow us to reach 0.2 - 0.5% level of precision in @xmath2 and the parallax but the geometry of the orbit ( @xmath3 ) hampers the absolute mass precision to 3.3% , which is still an order of magnitude better than for previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with a set of yonsei - yale theoretical stellar isochrones and conclude that by dra is probably a main sequence system more metal - rich than the sun . using the orbital inclination and the available rotational velocities of the components , we also conclude that the rotational axes of the components are likely misaligned with the orbital angular momentum . given by dra s main sequence status , late spectral type and the relatively short orbital period , </S>",
    "<S> its high orbital eccentricity and probable spin - orbit misalignment are not in agreement with the tidal theory . </S>",
    "<S> this disagreement may possibly be explained by smaller rotational velocities of the components and the presence of a substellar mass companion to by dra ab .    </S>",
