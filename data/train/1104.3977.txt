    "the further miniaturization of electronic devices will eventually lead to molecular electronics wherein particles pass through molecular - scale devices whose constituent molecules may have been manipulated and synthetically assembled or created.@xcite molecular transistors , in particular , are of significant practical interests and whose successful implementations are currently actively being pursued .",
    "several theoretical models of the transistor have been proposed@xcite and experimental successes have also been reported.@xcite a related molecular - scale device , the molecular switch , has also garnered significant interests because of the switch s important role in circuit design and architecture .",
    "a theoretical model of the switch makes use of a mechanism that involves the reversible displacement of an atom in a molecular wire through the application of a gate voltage.@xcite in addition , experimental realizations of the atomic switch include mechanisms involving the reversible transfer of an atom between two leads,@xcite the dynamical onset of single - atom contact between leads@xcite and the manipulation of atomic bonds using a dynamic force microscope.@xcite having a dynamical switch in a nano - circuit , however , necessitates the appearance of time - dependent behavior , particularly during the transient regime just after switch - on .",
    "the circuit transitions from being disconnected into connected in a short time and the current does not instantly switches into the steady - state value upon connection .",
    "it is therefore informative to know the characteristics of the current just after switch - on and during the transient regime , and determine how this current approaches the steady - state value . in this work , we introduce a model device representing a system wherein the current can be dynamically toggled on and off",
    ". there are several theoretical approaches in treating time - dependent quantum transport . among these include time - dependent density functional theory,@xcite propagating the kadanoff - baym equations,@xcite floquet theory,@xcite path - integral techniques,@xcite and the density matrix renormalization group method.@xcite in this work we choose to use time - dependent nonequilibrium green s functions ( td - negf ) because , as is shown in this paper , dynamically toggling the coupling between the leads is straightforward using the technique , even without the assumption of weak coupling , and the resulting expression for the time - dependent current is numerically exact .",

    "[ fig : main],width=288 ]    the device we examine consists of a semi - infinite linear chain of atoms , i.e. , the left lead , which is stationary and another semi - infinite linear chain of atoms , i.e. , the right lead , that is on a rotatable disk .",
    "an illustration of the device is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : main](a ) . when the disk is rotated clockwise to the dashed line",
    ", the left and right leads align and conduction occurs .",
    "we model how the two leads couple in two ways : as an abrupt heaviside step function and as a hyperbolic tangent that gradually progresses in time . for such cases , the off state",
    "has no current flowing across the leads .",
    "in addition , we can also model an oscillator by swinging the disk back and forth across the dashed line .",
    "the rotatable disk can also be replaced by a gate voltage , located on top of the right lead , that could rotate the right lead to its desired position .",
    "this latter configuration has previously been examined and , in particular , the steady - state transport properties of its on and off states have been studied @xcite . in this paper , however , we study the full time - dependent transport properties of the device . numerically exact expressions for the current and the needed nonequilibrium green s functions are derived .",
    "we then show that just after switch - on and during the transient regime the current initially overshoots the expected value of the steady - state current and then oscillates around the steady - state value while decaying as a power law .",
    "such a power - law decaying transient current suggests the appearance of dynamical resistance , inductance , and capacitance in the system during the transient regime .",
    "power - law decaying currents have also recently been predicted to appear in a system containing a quantum dot channel@xcite and in the anisotropic kondo model.@xcite",
    "we implement time - dependent nonequilibrium green s functions techniques to investigate the dynamical transport properties of particles traversing through a device with time - varying components . to determine the dynamical transport properties ,",
    "a td - negf approach can be used that utilizes either two - time@xcite green s functions , or double - energy@xcite green s functions , or green s functions that depend on one time and one energy variables.@xcite in a transistor with source - channel - drain and top gate configuration , for example , the device can be modeled by a hamiltonian constructed using density functional theory@xcite or tight - binding theory@xcite and the dynamical transport properties of small channels are calculated using td - negf . for devices with larger channels , a self - consistent calculation based on the poisson equation and td - negf can be done to determine the consistent dynamical potential and charge density in the channel.@xcite in this work , in contrast , we study a device consisting only of two leads , i.e. , there is no channel between the leads .",
    "the time - dependence comes from non - adiabatically toggling on the coupling between the leads .",
    "we use td - negf to derive a numerically exact expression for the dynamical current and investigate how the devices we call a nano - relay and a nano - oscillator respond to time - varying influences .",
    "this approach has recently also been used in the study of dynamical heat transport in a thermal switch@xcite .",

    "it can be seen that as the driving frequency is decreased the amplitude of the oscillations also decreases .",
    "in addition , the peaks are displaced to later times because of the more gradual progress of the interleads coupling @xmath38 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tanh ] we also see the dependence of the decay time of the transient current to the applied bias potential and the speed of the switch - on . the higher bias results in a faster decay time for the oscillating transient current .",
    "the transient current oscillates and decays in time until it settles to a steady - state value.@xcite during the transient regime the strength of the interleads coupling dynamically changes resulting in particles temporarily accumulating at the left and right sides of that coupling .",
    "although we do not explicitly consider coulomb interactions between charges , the temporary accumulation of charges at the sides of the interleads coupling , together with the distance between the accumulated charges and the applied bias voltage across the interleads coupling , can be regarded to generate a temporary dynamical capacitance .",
    "similarly , a dynamical inductance may arise because the transient current is varying in time . by considering possible equivalent circuit combinations and performing least - squares fitting to the envelope of the decaying transient current",
    "we find that the decay closely follows a power law , indicating an equivalent series resistor - inductor - capacitor ( rlc ) circuit whose components have time - dependent properties . in a previous study using semiclassical boltzmann transport theory on quantum wires , it is found that the wire can be modeled by an equivalent series rlc circuit.@xcite a series rlc circuit consisting of components with constant resistance , inductance , and capacitance results in a transient current whose envelope decays as an exponential function .",
    "however , when the resistance , inductance , and capacitance vary in time , the resulting transient current can oscillate and could decay as a power law .",

    "<S> time - dependent nonequilibrium green s functions are used to study electron transport properties in a device consisting of two linear chain leads and a time - dependent interleads coupling that is switched on non - adiabatically . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a numerically exact expression for the particle current and examine its characteristics as it evolves in time from the transient regime to the long - time steady - state regime . </S>",
    "<S> we find that just after switch - on the current initially overshoots the expected long - time steady - state value , oscillates and decays as a power law , and eventually settles to a steady - state value consistent with the value calculated using the landauer formula . </S>",
    "<S> the power - law parameters depend on the values of the applied bias voltage , the strength of the couplings , and the speed of the switch - on . in particular , the oscillating transient current decays away longer for lower bias voltages . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the power - law decay nature of the current suggests an equivalent series resistor - inductor - capacitor circuit wherein all of the components have time - dependent properties . such dynamical resistive , inductive , and capacitive influences are generic in nano - circuites where dynamical switches are incorporated . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the characteristics of the dynamical current in a nano - oscillator modeled by introducing a sinusoidally modulated interleads coupling between the two leads . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the current does not strictly follow the sinusoidal form of the coupling . in particular , the maximum current does not occur during times when the leads are exactly aligned . instead , the times when the maximum current occurs depend on the values of the bias potential , nearest - neighbor coupling , and the interleads coupling . </S>"
