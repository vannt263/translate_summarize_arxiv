    "to understand the nature of friendships online with respect to geographic distance , some efforts have originally focused on users online profiles that include their city of residence . in  @xcite ,",
    "experimental results based on the livejournal social network demonstrated a close relationship between geographic distance and probability distribution of friendship , where the probability of befriending a particular user on livejournal is inversely proportional to the positive power of the number of closer users .",
    "however , the geographic location points only to the location of users at a _ city scale_. for this reason , the friendship degree distribution contains a background probability that is independent of geography due to the city - scale resolution . as follow - up studies , using the data collected from facebook  @xcite and three popular online location - based social networks ( lbsns )  @xcite , it was found that the probability distribution of friendship as a function of distance also closely follows a single power - law but represents some heterogeneous features .",
    "more precisely , it is observed in  @xcite that the corresponding curve has two regions according to the population density , indicating that it is flatter at shorter distances  a small fraction of facebook users who entered their home addresses were used . in  @xcite ,",
    "the probability of friendship with distance was shown to present noisy patterns such as an almost flatness in a certain range  the home location of each user was defined as the place with the largest number of check - ins .",
    "contrary to  @xcite , based on the data collected from the tuenti social network , it was found in  @xcite that social interactions online are only weakly affected by spatial proximity , with other factors dominating .",
    "alternatively , there is extensive and growing interest among researchers to understand a variety of social behaviors through geo - tagged tweets  @xcite .",
    "the volume of geo - located twitter has grown constantly and now forms an invaluable register for understanding human behavior and modelling the way people interact in space . in  @xcite , along with geo - locations for collected tweets , analysis included how geo - related factors such as physical distance , frequency of air travel , national boundaries , and language differences affect formation of social ties on twitter . in  @xcite",
    ", it was found that the geo - locations of twitter users across different countries considerably impact their participation in twitter and their connectivity with other users .",
    "new approaches based on geo - tagged tweets were also proposed to find top vacation spots for a particular holiday by applying indexing , spatio - temporal querying , and machine learning techniques  @xcite and to detect unusual geo - social events by measuring geographical regularities of crowd behaviors  @xcite . additionally , owing to the location information from geo - tagged tweets ,",
    "there has been a steady push to understand individual human mobility  @xcite , which is of fundamental importance for many applications .",
    "recent effort has focused on the studies of human mobility using tracking technologies such as mobile phones , gps receivers , wifi logging , bluetooth , and rfid devices as well as lbsn check - in data  @xcite , but these technologies involve privacy concerns or data access restrictions . on the other hand",
    ", geo - tagged tweets can capture much richer features of human mobility  @xcite .",
    "in our work , we utilize _ geo - tagged mentions _ on twitter , sent by users , to identify their exact location information . a ` mention ' in twitter",
    "consists of inclusion of ",
    "@username \" anywhere in the body of tweets . from the fact that we tend to interact offline with people living very near to us ,",
    "we derive as a natural extension the question whether geography and social relationships are inextricably intertwined on twitter .",
    "our research is interested in how a pair of users interacts through geo - tagged mentions .",
    "as people normally spend a substantial amount of time online , data regarding these two dimensions ( i.e. , geography and online social relationships ) are becoming increasingly precise , thus motivating us to build more reliable models to describe social interactions  @xcite .",
    "this paper goes beyond past research to determine how friendship patterns are geographically represented by twitter , analyzing a single - source dataset that contains a huge number of geo - tagged mentions from users in i ) the state of california in the united states ( us ) and los angeles ( the most populous city in the state ) and ii ) the united kingdom ( uk ) and london ( the most populous city in the uk ) . these two location sets were selected as demographically comparable , yet distinct and geographically separated , leading adopters of twitter with sufficient data to enable meaningful comparative analysis for our intentionally exploratory study .",
    "we propose and apply the following framework , which establishes a much more accurate friendship degree on twitter , and a method to enable analysis based on geographic distance :    * to fully take into account the intensity of communication between users , we start our analysis by introducing a rather strong definition of  _ friend _ \" on twitter , i.e. , a definition of _ bidirectional friendship _ , instead of navely considering the set of followers and followees ( unidirectional terms ) .",
    "this definition requires bidirectional communication within a designated time frame or creating a friendship .",
    "* by showing that almost all twitter users are likely to post consecutive tweets in the static mode ( i.e. , no movement mode ) , we propose a two - stage distance estimation method , where the geographic distance between two befriended users based on our definition of bidirectional friendship is estimated by sequentially measuring the two senders locations .",
    "we would like to synthetically analyze how the geographic distance between twitter users affects their interaction , based on our new framework .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows :    * we characterize a newly - discovered probability distribution of the number of friends according to _ geographic distance _ , which does not follow a homogenous power - law but , instead , a _",
    "double power - law _",
    "( i.e. , a _ double pareto law _ ) .",
    "* from this new finding , we identify not only two fundamentally _ separate regimes _ , which are characterized by two different power - laws in the distribution , but also the _ separation point _ between these regimes .",
    "we refer to our full paper  @xcite for more detailed description and all the rigorous steps .",
    "we use a dataset collected via twitter streaming api .",
    "the dataset consists of a huge amount of geo - tagged mentions recorded from twitter users from september 22 , 2014 to october 23 , 2014 ( about one month ) in the following four regions : california , los angeles , uk , and london .",
    "note that this short - term ( one month ) dataset is sufficient to examine how closely one user has recently interacted with another online . in this dataset",
    ", each mention record has a geo - tag and a timestamp indicating from where , when , and by whom the mention was sent . based on this information , we are able to construct a user s location history denoted by a sequence @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the @xmath3 and @xmath4 coordinates of user @xmath5 at time @xmath6 , respectively",
    ". the location information provided by the geo - tag is denoted by latitude and longitude , which are measured in degrees , minutes , and seconds .",
    "each mention on twitter contains a number of entities that are distinguished by their attributed fields . for data analysis",
    ", we adopted the following five essential fields from the metadata of mentions :    * _ useridstr _ : string representation of the sender i d * _ inreplytouseridstr _ : string representation of the receiver i d * _ lat _ : latitude of the sender * _ lon _ : longitude of the sender * _ createdat _ : utc / gmt time when the mention is delivered , i.e. , the timestamp",
    "we start by introducing the following definition of  bidirectional friendship \" on twitter .",
    "if two users send / receive mentions to / from each other ( i.e. , bidirectional personal communication occurs ) within a designated amount of time , then they form a bidirectional friendship with each other .",
    "note that our definition differs from the conventional definition of  friend \" on twitter , which is referred to as a followee and thus represents a _",
    "unidirectional _ relation .",
    "this strong definition enables exclusion of _ inactive friends _ who have been out of contact online for a long designated amount of time ( e.g. , about one month in our work ) and to count the number of _ active friends _ who have recently communicated with each other .",
    "now , let us characterize the friendship degree of individuals regarding geography by analyzing their sequences @xmath0 of geo - tagged mentions , where only the senders location information is recorded . we propose a two - stage distance estimation method , where the geographic distance between two befriended users is estimated by sequentially measuring the two senders locations .",
    "we first focus on the time interval between the following two events for a befriended pair : a mention and its _ replied _ mention at the next closest time .",
    "we count only the events with a time duration between a mention and its replied mention , or inter - mention interval , of _ less than one hour _ to exclude certain inaccurate location information that may occur due to users movements .",
    "we next consider the instance for which user @xmath7 , originally placed at @xmath8 , sent a mention to user @xmath9 at @xmath10 , and then received a replied mention at the location @xmath11 from user @xmath9 placed at @xmath12 . from these two consecutive mention events ,",
    "it is possible to estimate the geographic distance based on the two sequences @xmath8 and @xmath12 . in our framework , by assuming that the earth is spherical , we deal with the shortest path between two users locations measured along the surface of the earth . then , the distance between two locations on the earth s surface can be computed according to the spherical law of cosines , which gives a well - conditioned result of the estimated distance down to distances as small as around 1 meter . the estimated distance for one pair is finally obtained by taking the average of all distance values computed over the available inter - mention intervals , each of which is less than one hour . while the estimated distance may differ from the actual distance between users @xmath7 and @xmath9 at time @xmath13 , it is worth noting that people tend to send / receive multiple consecutive tweets from the same location to convey a series of ideas  @xcite .",
    "our supplementary experiments also demonstrate that most of the twitter users ( approximately 90% ) in the four regions under consideration are likely to post consecutive tweets in the _ static _",
    "mode whose average velocity ranges from 0 to 2 km / h . although the inter - tweet interval may show a different pattern from that of the inter - mention interval , we believe that our demonstration is sufficient to support our analysis methodology .",
    "using bidirectional mentions in section  [ sec : method ] , we characterize the probability distribution @xmath14 of the number of friends according to the distance @xmath15 , where @xmath15 [ km ] is the geographic distance between a user and his / her friend . unlike the earlier work in  @xcite , the heterogeneous shape of @xmath14 for the entire interval can not be captured by a single commonly - used statistical function such as a homogeneous power - law using the approach of parametric fitting .",
    "interestingly , we observe that for the distance @xmath16 $ ] , @xmath14 can be described as a _",
    "double power - law _ distribution , which is given below : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the exponents for each individual power - law and @xmath20 is the _ separation point_. this finding indicates that the friendship degree can be composed of two separate regimes characterized by two different power - laws , termed the _ intra - city _ and _ inter - city _ regimes .",
    "figure  [ fig : distance ] shows the log - log plot of the distribution @xmath14 from empirical data , logarithmically binned data , and fitting function , where the fitting is applied to the binned data . as depicted in the figure , statistical noise exists in the tail for large @xmath15 , which can be eliminated by applying logarithmic binning .. ] we use the traditional least squares estimation to obtain the fitting function .    unlike the earlier studies that do not capture the friendship patterns in the intra - city regime , our analysis exhibits two distinguishable features with respect to distance .",
    "more specifically , in each regime , the following interesting observations are made :    * in the intra - city regime , @xmath14 decays slowly with distance @xmath15 , which means that geographic proximity weakly affects the number of intra - city friends with which one user interacts .",
    "that is , in this regime , the geographic distance is less relevant for determining the number of friends .",
    "this finding reveals that more active twitter users tend to preferentially interact over _ short - distance _ connections . * in the inter - city regime , @xmath14 depends strongly on the geographic distance , where there exists a sharp transition in the distribution @xmath14 beyond the separation point @xmath20 .",
    "thus , _ long - distance _ communication is made occasionally .",
    "the above argument stems from the fact that the separation point @xmath20 is closely related to the length and width of the city in which a user resides . from these observations",
    ", we may conclude that , within a given period , the individual is much more likely to contact online mostly friends who are in location - based communities that range from the local neighborhood , suburb , village , or town up to the city level .",
    "in addition , the following interesting comparisons are performed according to types of regions :    * * comparison between the city - scale and state - scale / country - scale results * : we observe that @xmath20 in populous metropolitan areas is greater than that in larger regions that include local small towns ( such as at the state or country level ) .",
    "for example , from figures  1(a ) and 1(b ) , we see that @xmath20 is 8 km and 22 km in california and los angeles , respectively . from figures 1(c ) and 1(d ) , the same trend is observed by comparing the results for the uk and london ( 18 km and 21 km , respectively ) .",
    "this finding reveals that twitter users in populous metropolitan areas ( e.g. , los angeles and london ) have a stronger tendency to contact friends on twitter who are geographically away from their location ( i.e. , interacting over long - distance connections ) .",
    "this is because the average size ( referred to as the land area ) of the considered metropolitan cities is relatively bigger than that of larger regions including small towns .",
    "it is also seen that the exponent in the inter - city regimes ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) in metropolitan areas is significantly higher than that in larger regions . unlike the state - scale / country - scale results",
    ", this finding implies that @xmath14 sharply drops off beyond @xmath20 in huge metropolitan areas . * * comparison between the results in the two cities * : from figures  1(b ) and 1(d ) , one can see that @xmath18 is 0.60 and 0.38 and @xmath19 is 6.23 and 7.13 in los angeles and london , respectively .",
    "thus , in the intra - city regime , the geographic distance is less relevant in london for determining the number of friends .",
    "however , in the inter - city regime , @xmath14 in london shows a bit steeper decline .",
