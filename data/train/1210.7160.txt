    "as already mentioned , in most cases , exact evaluation of the pair transfer probabilities can not be performed and approximations for the many - body states are necessary .",
    "the most common strategy used in nuclear physics is to first apply the hfb or bcs theory and minimize the energy in the hilbert space of quasi - particle vacuum imposing a mean particle number equal to @xmath52 .",

    "is already written in the canonical basis for the hfb theory .",
    "this theory is particularly suitable to provide estimates for ground state ( gs ) to gs transfer probabilities @xcite .",
    "since we want to compare with exact results , at the bcs / hfb and qrpa level the contribution to the particle - hole channel of the pairing interaction is taken into account .",
    "the result of the hfb theory for this probability is shown in figure [ fig2bis : pair ] and compared to the exact solution .",
    "note that below the pairing threshold ( denoted by @xmath57 and equal to 0.33 mev and 0.44 mev for the @xmath58 particles system in the equally spaced and random spaced case , respectively ) , the hfb reduces to hf and probability is @xmath59 . as illustrated in this figure ,",
    "while the hf theory ( not shown ) would have failed to reproduce the exact probabilities , the hfb framework gives estimations that are already rather close to the exact ones in the superfluid regime .",
    "due to the absence of residual coupling between quasi - particle excitations , it is known that hfb alone can not properly describe excited states .",
    "then , linear response theory including possible particle - particle ( pp ) , hole - hole ( hh ) , or particle - hole ( ph ) excitations is applied to describe excited states , and then transfer probabilities , within the qrpa approach . in qrpa ,",

    "in particular , the threshold in energy that is directly related to pairing correlation is properly accounted for .",
    "it is worth to mention , that such a threshold can only be described in a mean - field theory by breaking particle number symmetry .",
    "finally , it is also clearly seen that some differences exist between the exact and qrpa . in general qrpa",
    "leads to peaks in the strength that are at slightly higher energies compared to the exact solution while probabilities are slightly overestimated .",
    "these differences are even stronger in the random space case and can stem from different origins . first , while part of the four quasi - particles ( 4qp ) are accounted for in the qrpa ground state correlations , the complete inclusion of 4qp excitations is known to modify excited state energy spectrum @xcite .",

    "[ fig2bis : pair ] , the bcs approach reduces to hf below the threshold and is not able to reproduce the transfer probability at low g. the projection after variation ( open square ) obviously does not cure this problem but considerably improves the probability above the threshold especially in the strong coupling regime .",
    "note that as a conclusion , the hfb and/or bcs approach augmented by an a posteriori projection is already very good to describe gs to gs transition in the superfluid regime .",
    "therefore , in the following we will concentrate the discussion on excited state where it is necessary to go beyond hfb .    from previous discussion",
    ", we are facing the following dilemma : to describe the physics of pairing and in particular the gap in energy between the ground state and the first excited state in a superfluid system , it is necessary to break the @xmath77 symmetry . on the other hand",
    ", this symmetry breaking seems to be at the origin of some discrepancies between qrpa and exact pair transfer probabilities .",
    "the most direct extension of the projection technique to estimate transition from ground state to ground state would be to directly estimate the transition from the bcs / hfb ground state projected onto @xmath52 particle to the qrpa eigenstates projected onto @xmath40 particles .",
    "this has however two disadvantages ( i ) in practice we found that the pair transfer probabilities that are much smaller than the exact ones ( ii ) qrpa states are not anymore orthogonal after projection leading to some difficulties to interpret the probabilities themselves .",

    "the projection on particle number is made by discretizing the gauge angle integration using the fomenko approach with 199 points @xcite .",

    "these figures clearly demonstrate that the projected tda approach provides a much better description of the energy peak positions of the excited states in the system with @xmath40 particles .",
    "however , probabilities of transfer are underestimated especially as @xmath18 decreases .",
    "further improvements can a priori be made by including more correlations in the ground state @xmath113 .",
    "here , we simply used a projection after variation ( pav ) approach to approximate this state . a better treatment would be to perform a vap as originally proposed in ref . @xcite .",
    "further correlations , like correlations induced by the coupling to 4qp states might be included using projected qrpa instead of projected tda approach .",
    "the projected qrpa approach has also been formulated previously ( section iii - b of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in that case , not only the projected 2qp states but also the projected 4qp states should be explicitly introduced .",
    "the use of vap and/or the introduction of 4qp , although possible in the present model @xcite , will considerably increase the complexity of the approach in realistic situations ( see for instance @xcite for the vap ) .",
    "below , we propose a simpler method inspired from p - qtda and able to grasp part of the ground state correlations without increasing the numerical complexity .",
    "contrary to standard linear response theory based on hf ( resp .",
    "hfb ) , the ground state projected onto good particle number is not orthogonal to the particle - hole ( resp .",
    "2qp ) excited states .",
    "similarly , the projected 2qp states are themselves not orthogonal to the projected 4qp or higher order excitations . at first glance ,",
    "this might be seen as a disadvantage compared to rpa or qrpa since additional orthonormalization is required .",
    "on the contrary , one might take advantage of the presence of higher order components to improve the description of the gs itself .",
    "the aim of the p - qtda approach was to describe excitations with respect to the projected ground state .",
    "then , the latter state has been naturally removed before solving the eigenvalues equation ( eq .",

    "this direct approach , called below p - qtda@xmath110 , not only provides a way to get excited states but might also improve the description of the ground state itself .",

    "<S> exact results of pair transfer probabilities for the richardson model with equidistant or random level spacing are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the results are then compared either to particle - particle random phase approximation ( pprpa ) in the normal phase or quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) in the superfluid phase . </S>",
    "<S> we show that both pprpa and qrpa are globally well reproducing the exact case although some differences are seen in the superfluid case . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the qrpa overestimates the pair transfer probabilities to excited states in the vicinity of the normal - superfluid phase transition , which might explain the difficult in detecting collective pairing phenomena as for example the giant pairing vibration . </S>",
    "<S> the shortcoming of qrpa can be traced back to the breaking of particle number that is used to incorporate pairing . </S>",
    "<S> a method , based on direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian in the space of two quasi - particle projected onto good particle number is shown to improve the description of pair transfer probabilities in superfluid systems . </S>"
