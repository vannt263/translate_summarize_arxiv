    "a metric @xmath4 on a finite set @xmath1 is said to be a ` tree metric ' if there is a finite tree with leaf set @xmath1 and non - negative edge weights so that , for all @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the path distance in the tree between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is well known that not every metric is a tree metric .",
    "however , when a metric @xmath4 is a tree metric , the tree ( together with its edge weights ) that provides a representation of @xmath4 is  up to canonical isomorphism ",
    "unique if we also insist that the tree is an ` edge - weighted @xmath9tree ' , i.e. , that it has no vertices of degree @xmath2 and that all of its interior edges have strictly positive edge weights .",
    "however , not all of the @xmath10 pairs of distances are required in order to reconstruct the underlying tree .",
    "thus , it seems of some interest to investigate which subsets of @xmath3 suffice to determine ( ` lasso ' ) the tree . in this first of a series of papers , we expound various aspects of this problem , present some relevant definitions , and collect some basic facts .",
    "our work is partly motivated by the widespread use of distance - based methods for reconstructing phylogenetic trees in evolutionary biology @xcite .",
    "a further reason is that asking similar questions for induced subtrees rather than for ` sparse ' sets of distances gave rise to a rather appealing theory dealing with ` sparse ' collections of induced subtrees that suffice to ` define ' an @xmath9tree ( see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "provided one has access to all distances , and these are known to be sufficiently close to the distances induced by some ( as yet unknown ) tree , then that tree , together with its edge weighting , can be computed  with some degree of confidence  from those distances in polynomial time ( for example , by using neighbor - joining @xcite )",
    ". however , much of the data being generated  even by modern genomic methods  have patchy taxon coverage @xcite whereby only certain pairs of taxa have a known ( or , at least , sufficiently reliable ) distance .",
    "this raises interesting mathematical questions ( besides the obvious statistical and algorithmic ones ) concerning tree reconstruction from such incomplete data some of which we will address here .",
    "more specifically , in this first of a series of papers , we want to explore the basic properties of ` edge - weight ' , ` topological ' , and ` strong lassos '  being primarily interested in the uniqueness question : given the restriction of a tree metric @xmath4 to some subset @xmath11 of @xmath3 , how much can we learn about the tree representing @xmath4 from that restriction ?",
    "in particular , we ask which subsets @xmath11 of @xmath12 provide enough ` coverage ' in order to fully determine an edge - weighted @xmath9tree or , at least , its shape , or  given its shape  its edge lengths in terms of just the distances it induces between the pairs of taxa collected in @xmath11 . or , put differently , how much ` missing data ' ( pairs of taxa @xmath13 for which @xmath6 is not known ) can we allow and still be guaranteed to recover them from those distances that we can observe .",
    "consider any finite tree @xmath14 with vertex set @xmath15 , leaf set @xmath16 , and edge set @xmath17 together with an _ edge weighting _ ",
    "i.e. , a map @xmath18 in the set @xmath19 that assigns a non - negative length @xmath20 to every edge @xmath21 .",
    "any such pair @xmath22 induces a distance function : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes , for any two vertices @xmath25 , the set of edges in @xmath26 that ` separate ' @xmath27 and @xmath28 in @xmath0 ( and , thus , together make up the path from @xmath27 to @xmath28 in @xmath0 ) and @xmath29 denotes , for any non - empty subset @xmath30 of @xmath26 , the sum @xmath31 .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ figure_quartet ] , we have @xmath32 and , thus , @xmath33 for the binary tree @xmath34 with leaf set @xmath35 and an interior edge that separates the leaves @xmath36 from the leaves @xmath37 provided unit edge length has been assigned to all edges of that tree .    while @xmath38 is clearly a ( pseudo-)metric on @xmath1 ( and a proper metric",
    "if  but not necessarily only if  @xmath18 is strictly positive ) , not every metric on @xmath1 can be represented in this way : the condition for an arbitrary metric @xmath4 on @xmath1 to have a _ phylogenetic representation _ , that is , to be representable in the form @xmath39 for some finite edge - weighted tree @xmath40 with leaf set @xmath1 , is that @xmath4 satisfies the well - known _ four - point condition _ which states that , for all @xmath41 , the larger two of the three distance sums @xmath42 coincide or , equivalently , if @xmath43 is non - negative for all @xmath41 .",
    "such a metric @xmath4 is said to be a _ tree metric _ , and any finite tree @xmath14 as above for which some @xmath44 with @xmath39 exists will be dubbed a _",
    "@xmath45tree_. furthermore , such a tree @xmath0 will be said to be a _ proper @xmath45tree _ if @xmath0 has no vertices of degree @xmath2 and it has a _ proper _ edge weighting @xmath18 with @xmath39 , i.e. , a map @xmath44 that is strictly positive on all interior edges of @xmath0 .",
    "clearly , given any tree metric @xmath4 , many non - equivalent @xmath45trees @xmath0 with edge weightings @xmath18 can exist such that @xmath39 holds , since adding zero - length edges and/or subdividing any edge of a @xmath45tree by degree @xmath2 vertices yields further @xmath45trees .",
    "however , it has been well known since the @xmath46s ( see , for instance ,  @xcite and @xcite and the references therein ) that there is ` essentially ' only one proper @xmath45tree @xmath0 for any tree metric @xmath4 and , given @xmath0 , only one edge weighting @xmath44 for which @xmath39 holds .",

    "@xmath0 can be obtained from @xmath57 by collapsing edges in @xmath57 ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the basic result referred to above then states that , given any two @xmath9trees @xmath69 with proper edge weightings @xmath44 and @xmath70 , one has @xmath71 and , therefore , also @xmath72 for any fixed @xmath9tree @xmath14 and all @xmath73 .",

    "<S> a classical result , fundamental to evolutionary biology , states that an edge - weighted tree @xmath0 with leaf set @xmath1 , positive edge weights , and no vertices of degree @xmath2 can be uniquely reconstructed from the leaf - to - leaf distances between any two elements of @xmath1 . in biology </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath1 corresponds to a set of taxa ( e.g. extant species ) , the tree @xmath0 describes their phylogenetic relationships , the edges correspond to earlier species evolving for a time until splitting in two or more species by some speciation / bifurcation event , and their length corresponds to the genetic change accumulating over that time in such a species . in this paper , we investigate which subsets of @xmath3 suffice to determine ( ` lasso ' ) the tree @xmath0 from the leaf - to - leaf distances induced by that tree . </S>",
    "<S> the question is particularly topical since reliable estimates of genetic distance - even ( if not in particular ) by modern mass - sequencing methods - are , in general , available only for certain combinations of taxa . </S>"
