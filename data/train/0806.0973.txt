    "the aim of the present work is to consider this order structure on grand - dyck paths ( which are , by definition , like dyck paths , except that they are allowed to cross the @xmath5-axis ) , and to study some of its properties , as well as to find some related order structure on some kind of noncrossing partitions and pattern avoiding permutations . in trying to accomplish this project",

    "negative valley ) of the associated grand - dyck path .",
    "the set @xmath6 of grand - dyck paths of length @xmath7 can be naturally ordered by declaring @xmath145 whenever @xmath146 , for all @xmath17 .",
    "this means that the path @xmath3 lies weakly below @xmath4 ( see the example in figure 7 ) .",
    "this very natural partial order is easily seen to yield a distributive lattice structure , in which the join and meet of two paths are taken coordinatewise .",
    "the minimum and maximum of these lattices will be denoted @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively .",
    "see figure 8 for the hasse diagram of @xmath149 .",
    "the resulting lattice structures have already appeared in the literature ( see @xcite ) , but they have been considered on different combinatorial objects .",
    "it is immediate the following fact , whose easy proof is left to the reader .",
    "young lattices of partitions have been intensively investigated since many years , see for instance @xcite for an interesting study on the unimodality properties of such lattices .",
    "of course , as an immediate consequence of the above proposition , we have that grand - dyck lattices are rank - unimodal .",
    "however , even if the abstract lattice structure we are considering is not new , we claim that the study of order and lattice properties arising from the special representation in terms of grand - dyck paths is worth being carried out .",
    "_ _ proof ( sketch).__the covering relation on grand - dyck paths works as follows : @xmath4 covers @xmath3 if and only if @xmath4 can be obtained from @xmath3 by changing a valley into a peak .",
    "then the first part of the thesis immediately follows . as far as the second part is concerned , just observe that , thanks to the last proposition , join - irreducibles corresponds to integer partitions of rectangular shape.@xmath43    we have already mentioned that the lattices @xmath6 are rank - unimodal . the rank function @xmath152 of @xmath6",
    "is clearly related to the area function .",
    "more precisely , we have the following proposition .      _",
    "_ proof.__by induction , suppose that @xmath155 in @xmath6 and that @xmath156 . since @xmath4 is obtained from @xmath3 by simply reversing a valley , we have that @xmath157 , and so @xmath158 .",
    "since @xmath159 , the proof is completed.@xmath43    our next goal will be to translate the above described lattice structure on partitions .",
    "to accomplish this task we make use of the bijection between the set @xmath44 of factor - bicoloured dyck paths of length @xmath27 and component - bicoloured noncrossing partitions stated in proposition [ bij1 ] . for the sake of simplicity , from now on we will refer to black ( resp . , white ) items ( steps , factors , ... ) as to coloured ( resp . ,",
    "noncoloured ) items .",
    "we start by observing that the grand - dyck lattice structure can be read off on factor - bicoloured dyck paths as follows : if @xmath160 , we say that @xmath145 when , for every @xmath161 , one of the following holds :    1 .   if @xmath24 and @xmath162 both belong to coloured factors , then @xmath163 ; 2 .   if @xmath24 and @xmath162 both belong to noncoloured factors , then @xmath146 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath24 belongs to a coloured factor and @xmath162 belongs to a noncoloured one .",
    "now , if we transport this lattice structure along the above recalled bijection , we obtain a lattice structure on component - bicoloured noncrossing partitions . in the sequel",
    ", we denote these lattices of partitions @xmath84 ( where @xmath27 is the size of the ground set , of course ) .",
    "given @xmath139 , define the _ max - vector _ of @xmath25 to be the vector @xmath164 whose @xmath165-th component equals the maximum of the first @xmath165 element of @xmath31 , when @xmath25 is written in its standard form ; moreover , each component of @xmath166 appears coloured when it is coloured in @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , for instance , taken @xmath167 , we have @xmath168 .    for",
    "any given @xmath169 , denote by @xmath170 the set of max - vectors of @xmath84 , that is @xmath171 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath170 consists of all vectors with @xmath27 bicoloured components having increasing absolute values and such that , for any @xmath172 , @xmath173 and , if @xmath94 and @xmath174 have different colours , then @xmath175 .",
    "clearly , the covering relation of the poset @xmath183 $ ] can be described by saying that precisely one of the above situations @xmath184 or @xmath185 holds for a specific @xmath165 , whereas all the other components are equal , and in each of the three cases we have respectively :            * a coloured peak of @xmath3 is changed into a coloured valley of @xmath195 , or * a noncoloured valley of @xmath3 is changed into a noncoloured peak of @xmath195 , or * a coloured peak of @xmath3 is changed into a noncoloured peak of @xmath195 ( in this case the two peaks necessarily lies on the @xmath5-axis ) .",
    "now observe that , given @xmath196 , the position @xmath197 of the @xmath165-th down step in the associated factor - bicoloured dyck path is given by @xmath198 , and of course the same happens for the max - vector @xmath199 ( i.e. , @xmath200 ) .",
    "therefore , in the above three cases , we have :    * @xmath3 and @xmath195 coincide , except for a pair of adjacent steps , which is @xmath201 in @xmath3 and @xmath202 in @xmath195 .",
    "if the down step involved is the @xmath165-th , then we have @xmath203 .",
    "* @xmath3 and @xmath195 coincide , except for a pair of adjacent steps , which is @xmath204 in @xmath3 and @xmath205 in @xmath195 .",
    "if the down step involved is the @xmath165-th , then we have @xmath206 . *",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath195 coincide , except for a pair of adjacent steps , which is @xmath201 in @xmath3 and @xmath205 in @xmath195 , and such a peak lies on the @xmath5-axis . in this last case ,",
    "if the down step involved is the @xmath165-th , then we have that @xmath94 and @xmath180 have the same absolute value , but @xmath94 is coloured whereas @xmath180 is noncoloured .",
    "our last goal is to transfer the above order on signed pattern avoiding permutations .",
    "this can be done by simply applying the bar - removing bijection of proposition [ barremoving ] , thanks to which we obtain a partial order on @xmath138 .",
    "the following proposition gives a characterization of the associated covering relation .",
    "we will use the term _ signed _ ( respectively , _",
    "unsigned _ ) _ inversion _ of @xmath25 to mean a pair @xmath209 , with @xmath210 , @xmath211 ( resp . , @xmath212 ) , @xmath213 ( resp . , @xmath214 ) and @xmath215 .",
    "an analogous definition is given for the term _ signed ( unsigned ) noninversion_.         _ _ proof.__the condition @xmath192 in @xmath138 can be translated on factor - bicoloured paths by saying that exactly one of the three conditions listed in the proof of proposition [ maxvectors ] holds . using the results of @xcite",
    ", it is not difficult to conclude that the first two conditions corresponds , on permutations , to conditions @xmath220 and @xmath221 of the present proposition . concerning the third condition ,",
    "if , in a path @xmath3 , a coloured peak at height 0 is changed into a noncoloured one , then , on the associated permutation @xmath25 , we have a signed element belonging to a rise of @xmath31 which is changed into an unsigned one , and the proof is completed.@xmath43    the distributive lattice structure on @xmath138 obtained via the bar - removing bijection turns out to have a very interesting alternative combinatorial description . before giving it explicitly , we determine a formula to compute its rank function . given a permutation @xmath143 , we denote by @xmath222 the number of _ unsigned _ inversions of @xmath25 , by @xmath223 the number of non - inversions of @xmath31 and by @xmath224 the number of _ unsigned _ elements of @xmath25 .",
    "thus , for instance , given @xmath225 , we have @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 .        using an induction argument ,",
    "suppose that , in @xmath138 , we have @xmath190 . thanks to proposition [ permcov ] , we have three possible cases , which we deal with using the same numeration as in the statement of such a proposition .    * in this case , in the associated coloured dyck path there is a coloured peak which is changed into a coloured valley . referring to @xcite , we can then say that , in the permutation @xmath25 , a new signed noninversion is produced , and so : @xmath233 whence @xmath234 * this situation corresponds to changing a valley in a peak in a noncoloured factor of the associated coloured dyck path .",
    "but is it known from @xcite that this produces one more unsigned inversion in @xmath218 ( leaving unchanged all the signed elements ) , and so @xmath235 and an analogous computation as above immediately yields @xmath236 * finally , in this last case the difference between @xmath25 and @xmath218 consists of the fact that @xmath218 contains one more unsigned element , whence ( using analogous arguments as those for the preceding two cases ) the thesis follows.@xmath43    our last result , which we deem is the main one of the present paper , is the determination of an isomorphism between our lattices @xmath144 and an important and well known poset structure on permutations . to this aim",
    ", we need to introduce a few notations and definitions .",
    "call @xmath237 the set of permutation of the set @xmath238 , linearly ordered as indicated .",
    "as already remarked , this corresponds to setting @xmath239 and then considering the usual linear order . in what follows",
    ", we will often tacitly make the above identification , but we keep on writing @xmath240 instead of @xmath241 in order to gain a better readability .",
    "given @xmath25 in the hyperoctahedral group @xmath26 , denote by @xmath242 the permutation of @xmath237 defined by @xmath243 and @xmath244 , for every @xmath245 .",
    "thus , for instance , if @xmath246 , then @xmath247 .",
    "observe , in particular , that , given @xmath242 expressed , as usual , in one - line notation , @xmath25 is obtained , again in one - line notation , by taking the first half of the elements of @xmath248 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath249=\\ { \\hat{\\pi } \\ ;          * suppose that @xmath218 is obtained from @xmath25 by interchanging the elements of a signed inversion .",
    "to fix the notations , we can denote by @xmath251 the two elements such that @xmath210 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 are both signed and @xmath254 ( and so @xmath255 ) .",
    "then , from the definition of @xmath248 and @xmath256 , it follows that @xmath257 and @xmath258 are both signed and @xmath259 ( and so @xmath260 ) . since @xmath261",
    ", this means that @xmath256 possesses at least one more inversion than @xmath248 .",
    "an analogous argument on the elements @xmath262 and @xmath263 shows that @xmath256 has one further inversion more than @xmath248 .",
    "it is then easy to realize that these are the only inversions of @xmath256 which are not also in @xmath248 , and so we can conclude that @xmath256 has two more inversions than @xmath248 in the bruhat order of @xmath249 $ ] , which is enough to say that @xmath264 in such a bruhat poset . *",
    "an analogous argument can be developed when @xmath218 is obtained from @xmath25 by interchanging the elements of an unsigned noninversion .",
    "also in this case , following the same lines , it is possible to show that @xmath256 has two more inversions than @xmath248 in the bruhat order of @xmath249 $ ] . *",
    "if @xmath218 is obtained from @xmath25 by changing a signed element belonging to a rise into an unsigned one , then @xmath248 and @xmath256 coincide except for two elements ; more precisely , there exists a positive @xmath179 such that @xmath265 is signed ( and so @xmath266 is unsigned ) .",
    "thus , the pair @xmath267 is a noninversion in @xmath248 , whereas @xmath268 is an inversion in @xmath256 . from this",
    "we deduce that @xmath256 has one more inversion than @xmath248 .",
    "the above arguments allows us to conclude that , if @xmath217 in @xmath144 , then @xmath264 in the bruhat order of @xmath250 $ ] . as an obvious consequence",
    ", we have that , if @xmath269 in @xmath144 , then @xmath264 in the bruhat order of @xmath249 $ ] , which is the first part of the theorem .",
    "vice versa , suppose that @xmath270 in @xmath250 $ ] with the induced bruhat order .",
    "this means that @xmath271 is obtained from @xmath242 by performing as little inversions as possible ( and , of course , remaining inside the class @xmath249 $ ] ) .",
    "we can distinguish some cases .",
    "* given @xmath272 , if @xmath273 and both @xmath274 are unsigned , then we can exchange @xmath275 and @xmath276 , provided that there is no @xmath17 , @xmath277 , such that @xmath278 .",
    "however , in this case , we also need to exchange the two elements @xmath279 and @xmath280 in order to remain inside @xmath249 $ ] .",
    "thus , we have obtained a permutation @xmath271 having two more inversions than @xmath242 . translating all this on @xmath138 , we have that @xmath218 is obtained from @xmath25 by interchanging the elements of an unsigned noninversion .",
    "of course , we have , by symmetry , exactly the same situation if we start by considering @xmath281 such that @xmath282 and @xmath283 both signed . * with a completely analogous argument , we can prove that a permutation @xmath271 which covers @xmath242 in the induced bruhat order of @xmath249 $ ] can be obtained by interchanging @xmath279 and @xmath280 , when @xmath281 , @xmath279 and @xmath280 are both unsigned and @xmath282 ( or , equivalently , when @xmath272 , and @xmath284 ) . in @xmath144 ,",
    "this means that @xmath218 is obtained from @xmath25 by interchanging the elements of a signed inversion . *",
    "if @xmath279 and @xmath280 have different signs , for @xmath285 , we can not exchange @xmath279 and @xmath286 , since a @xmath141 pattern would arise . and",
    "the same would happen for @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",
    "* the only case which does not fit into one of the above is when @xmath271 is obtained from @xmath242 by interchanging two elements @xmath287 and @xmath280 , with @xmath285 . in this case",
    ", it is easy to see that , if @xmath275 and @xmath280 had different absolute values , then , in @xmath289 we would have two elements having the same absolute value , which is clearly not allowed . the only possibility we have to perform an interchange is to have @xmath290 ( i.e. , to interchange two elements of the kind @xmath291 ) . in this case , @xmath218 is obtained from @xmath25 by changing a signed element into an unsigned one , and , in order that the inversion in @xmath249 $ ] is minimal , it is necessary that , for every @xmath292 , @xmath293 .",
