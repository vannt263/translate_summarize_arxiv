    "the detection of @xmath0 particles has been explored for many years using a variety of detector systems having a wide range of efficiency and resolution , viz . , magnetic spectrometer  @xcite , plastic scintillators  @xcite , silicon  @xcite and germanium solid state detectors  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic spectrometer provides very high energy resolution but is limited in its efficiency and it is not considered suitable for the measurement involving short lived @xmath0 decaying state .",
    "this also requires an elaborate experimental setup as well as very high beam intensities in order to study the @xmath1 coincidence connecting the weakly populated states .",
    "the plastic scintillators are used for the detection of @xmath0 particles in order to provide a high efficiency detection and fast timing requirements but the poor energy resolution of plastic detectors is overcome by the use of solid state detectors .",
    "the silicon detectors have been widely used for this purpose but has a limitation in the detection efficiency specially for very high energy @xmath0 particles , which becomes more abundant as one moves away from the line of stability .",
    "the planar hyper pure germanium ( hpge ) detectors , having window materials with low z elements , have already been demonstrated to be quite efficient in this purpose  @xcite .",
    "moreover these detectors provide a very good energy resolution as well as can be calibrated up to very high energy using appropriate @xmath3 ray sources . however , the high atomic number of ge gives rise to high backscattering and bremsstrahlung production probability making a distortion at the low energy end of the fermi kurie plot . in spite of that the high purity",
    "germanium detectors are being used in many important fields of high precision nuclear @xmath0 decay  @xcite .",
    "experiments with planar hpge detectors have demonstrated that the end point energies can be determined within a reasonable error by fitting the data points with e @xmath10 0.8e@xmath11 , e@xmath11 being the maximum energy of the @xmath0 particle  @xcite",
    ". however , @xmath0 decays far off the @xmath0 stability line become weaker and hence the reasonable fitting of fermi kurie plot requires data points ranging a wider energy region .",
    "the fitting of experimental fermi kurie plot including the lower energy data points has been demonstrated to incorporate an upward curvature of the fitted line , attributed to the imperfections of the used sources  @xcite .",
    "consistent efforts have been given towards the simulations for the @xmath0 response of ge detectors and understanding the contribution from different sources as a function of energy .",
    "the same could be explained well as a combination of several functions corresponding to ( i ) full energy absorption peak of electron / positron , ( ii ) the escape of bremsstrahlung photons , ( iii ) side and back scattering from the detector wall and ( iv ) the addition of annihilation photon for positrons  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the geant4 code has also been proved to be equally competent to simulate the @xmath0 spectrum generated with a hpge detector  @xcite .",
    "the accurate measurement of the end point energies generated its importance in various fields of nuclear physics .",
    "this is used in obtaining the information on q@xmath12 values which in turn determines the atomic mass , one of the most fundamental quantities in nuclear physics .",
    "precise atomic masses , specifically , of the unstable nuclei away from the line of stability , can generate significant inputs to the theoretical model calculations as this manifests all interactions contributing to the nuclear binding  @xcite . in recent times , however , different experimental setups have also been available for very precise measurements of atomic masses both for the ground and isomeric states of a nucleus  @xcite .",
    "the experimental determination of @xmath0 decay end point energies play the significant role in the unambiguous establishment of the level structure of the daughter nuclei .",
    "many of the nuclei around the s - process and rp process path have very long lived @xmath0 decaying isomeric states  @xcite .",
    "the identification of these isomers is not possible in prompt @xmath13 coincidence study when the half lives range from seconds to hours .",
    "although the decay study of the daughter @xmath3 rays provides possibilities on their identification via the measurement of decay half lives , the absolute knowledge on the excitation energy and spin parity of such isomers is only possible by the coincidence measurement of the @xmath0 decay of the isomeric state and the corresponding @xmath3 decay in the daughter nucleus .",
    "the @xmath14 coincidence measurement with an appropriate @xmath0 detector becomes unique for determining the end point energies related to even very weakly populated levels of the daughter nuclei .",
    "this kind of measurements have been employed in some nuclei using plastic scintillators or si(li ) detectors  @xcite .",
    "studies are known that have employed the @xmath1 coincidence technique involving germanium detectors to measure the end point energies  @xcite .",
    "the application of this experimental technique has been proved to be very important in the study of isomers in neutron rich nuclei  @xcite .",
    "planar hpge detectors with low z entrance window are the only choice to measure the weak @xmath0 branches and high energy @xmath0 decays and thus important to explore with the decays having complicated level spectra of the daughter nuclei .    in the present work ,",
    "the @xmath0 decay end point energies have been determined by using @xmath14 coincidence technique for several known and unknown @xmath0 decays .",
    "the @xmath0 decay of neutron rich @xmath4rh with a complicated @xmath3 decay scheme of the daughter nucleus @xmath4pd has been considered for the measurement .",
    "end point energies have been extracted for very weak @xmath0 decay branches by the clean selection through @xmath3 gating .",
    "the experimentally obtained @xmath0 spectrum has been reproduced with substantial accuracy when compared with the results from a monte carlo simulation performed with geant3 code .",
    "the @xmath15 minimisation technique has been employed for known @xmath0 decays , in order to determine end point energy .",
    "the said analysis also reflects the confidence limit in the reproduction of the experimental curve by using the geant3 simulation .",
    "the experimental fermi kurie plots for specific @xmath0 branches were constructed in order to determine the end point energies with this conventional technique .",
    "the end point energies of known @xmath0 branches were reproduced with reasonable or better accuracy .",
    "the end point energies for few branches of @xmath4rh @xmath16 decay have been determined for the first time .",
    "the experimental setup consisted of a 11 mm thick ge planar segmented leps ( low energy photon spectrometer ) detector and a 10@xmath2 efficient coaxial hpge detector .",
    "the leps detector has a 300 @xmath17 m thick be window which completely stops the @xmath0 particles with energy up to 223 kev and the 10@xmath2 ge detector has response to only very high energy @xmath0 particles for its thick entrance window .",
    "the front face of the 10@xmath2 detector was covered with 11 mm thick aluminium plate in order to ensure that no @xmath0 particle enters this detector .",
    "the open sources of high specific activity with insignificant solid content were prepared and was dried on an electro - polished stainless steel surface of 0.5 mm thickness .",
    "the detectors were kept at a distance of 2.9 cm from each other and the source was kept at a distance of 0.9 cm from the leps detector .",
    "this was done in order to compensate for the different efficiencies of the two detectors .",
    "a coincidence measurement was carried out with this setup in order to extract several @xmath0 decay spectra corresponding to the decay of @xmath4rh @xmath7 @xmath4pd .",
    "a standard @xmath4ru source was used for this purpose .",
    "singles measurement was carried out only with the leps detector for the sources like @xmath6sr and @xmath5pb , as there are no @xmath3 transitions with reasonable intensity which are in coincidences with the corresponding @xmath0 decay .",
    "the above two sources correspond to the decay paths of @xmath6sr @xmath7 @xmath6y @xmath7 @xmath6zr and @xmath5pb @xmath7 @xmath5bi @xmath7 @xmath5po respectively .",
    "both the singles and coincidence timing electronics were consisted of nim standard timing filter amplifier ( ortec 863 ) , constant fraction discriminator ( ortec 584 ) and gate and delay generators(ortec 8020 ) . for the coincidence setup ,",
    "prompt coincidence was made within a time window of 50 ns between the cfd ` or ' output of the four segments of the leps detector and the cfd output from the 10@xmath2 hpge detector by using the four input logic unit ( ortec co4020 ) .",
    "a master gate was generated by stretching this coincidence gate in order to incorporate the five energy outputs corresponding to four segments of leps and the 10@xmath2 hpge detector .",
    "the energy outputs were taken from spectroscopy amplifiers ( canberra 2024 ) with a shaping time of 4 @xmath17sec for the leps detector and 8 @xmath17sec for the other hpge detector .",
    "the data were digitized and acquired with a multiparameter data acquisition system lamps  @xcite and two 13 bit adcs ( ortec ad413 ) .",
    "the decay scheme of the sources @xmath6sr and @xmath5pb are simpler ones with one high energy and few low energy @xmath0 decay branches  @xcite .",
    "the decay scheme of @xmath4ru followed by the decay of @xmath4rh , is a complicated one with a very weak decay branching of 0.64@xmath2 , 0.07@xmath18 and 0.46@xmath2 respectively for the 1128.04 , 1706.4 and 2001.5 kev excited levels  @xcite .",
    "the partial decay scheme of @xmath4rh @xmath7 @xmath4pd , relevant to this work has been shown in figure  [ levelscheme ] .",
    "the spectra obtained for these sources with one segment of the leps detector have been shown in figure  [ spec ] , when no selection was put in any of the detectors .",
    "the maximum energy points in each of the spectra corresponds to the q value of the @xmath0 decay of the parent ground state . for the top spectrum(a ) , the background @xmath3 transitions are not visible as the measurement was done in coincidence mode .",
    "the next two spectra ( b and c ) have a good number of @xmath3 transitions coming from the background activities and this is clearly seen in the background spectrum ( d ) , taken in singles mode .",
    "the @xmath0 spectra have been obtained from these raw data as described in the subsection  [ spec - beta ] .",
    "the obtained spectra have been reproduced by using the monte carlo simulation code geant3  @xcite as has been discussed in subsection  [ geant3 ] . in subsection",
    "[ endpoint ] , the methods have been described for obtaining the end point energies from the corresponding @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "the @xmath0 spectra of the sources @xmath6sr and @xmath5pb were extracted by subtracting the background spectrum ( figure  [ spec]d ) from the corresponding singles spectra(figure  [ spec]b and  [ spec]c ) after normalizing at one of the strong background @xmath3 transitions .",
    "the @xmath0 spectra thus obtained for the decay of @xmath6sr and @xmath5pb have been shown in figure  [ sr - pb - beta ] . in the decay of @xmath5pb ,",
    "the @xmath0 decay energies are known to be 17.0 kev ( 84@xmath2 ) , 63.5 kev ( 16@xmath2 ) and 1162.1 kev ( 100@xmath2 ) whereas in case of the decay of @xmath6sr , 546.0 kev ( 100@xmath2 ) , 2280.1 kev ( 99.98@xmath2 ) and 93.9 kev ( 1.4@xmath2 ) are the known @xmath0 decay branches .",
    "the low energy @xmath0 particles below 223 kev will not be detected by the leps detector as will be completely attenuated in the be window of the detector .",
    "thus , only the high energy decay branches have been indicated in the figure .",
    "spectra obtained for the known decays of ( a)@xmath5pb @xmath7 @xmath5bi @xmath7 @xmath5po and ( b)@xmath6sr @xmath7 @xmath6y @xmath7 @xmath6zr are shown with @xmath19 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the results from geant3 simulation . ]",
    "the leps detector used in the setup has response for both @xmath0 and @xmath3 radiations .",
    "hence , the coincidence setup in this work is equipped to detect the coincidences among the @xmath3 radiations decaying the excited states of daughter nucleus as well as the coincidences among these @xmath3 radiation and the @xmath0 particles decaying from the ground state of the parent nucleus populating the corresponding excited states of the daughter nucleus .",
    "it is thus expected that a coincidence spectrum in the leps detector made by gating a @xmath3 ray , decaying from the level of interest in daughter nucleus , in 10@xmath2 hpge detector , will have contribution from ( i. ) the respective @xmath0 decay branch populating the level of interest , @xmath20 ( ii . ) the @xmath3 rays ( photopeak and compton ) in coincidence which are decaying from the states below the level of interest , @xmath21s ( iii . ) the @xmath3 rays ( photopeak and compton ) in coincidence , de - exciting to the level of interest from the higher lying states , @xmath22s and ( iv . ) the @xmath0 branch decaying to these higher lying states , @xmath23 .",
    "hence , it is important to properly delineate and subtract all other contributions and to extract the required @xmath0 spectrum . for this purpose",
    "the coincidence measurements were taken in two configurations , viz .",
    ", ( a ) the open source facing the leps detector and putting no absorber other than the factory made be window in front of leps and ( b ) the open source facing the 10@xmath2 ge detector and keeping a 8 mm thick ta block in front of the leps detector .",
    "@xmath3 ray gate was put in the 10@xmath2 detector and the corresponding spectra were projected in four segments of the leps detector .",
    "the spectrum from configuration ( a ) consists of the response both from @xmath0 and @xmath3 radiations whereas the spectrum from configuration ( b ) consists of response only from @xmath3 in the leps detector .",
    "the spectra were normalized at the most intense photopeak in coincidence and the second spectrum was subtracted from the first one in order to arrive at the required @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "the contribution from the unwanted low energy @xmath0 branches , feeding the higher lying levels , were subtracted by appropriately subtracting the two different @xmath3 gates . while generating the @xmath0 spectra the original spectra were compressed in order to increase the statistical accuracy .",
    "15 kev/ channel binning was employed for strong decays and 50 kev / channel binning were done for weak decay branches . with this method",
