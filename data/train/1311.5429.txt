    "heavy - quarks , i.e. charm and beauty , are mainly produced in hard scattering processes in the early stages of high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions and they experience the full evolution of the medium formed in such collisions , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . therefore ,",
    "heavy - flavour hadrons are well suited probes to investigate the properties of the medium . due to their large masses , charm and beauty quarks",
    "are expected to lose less energy than light quarks and gluons when traversing the medium due to the dead - cone effect @xcite and also to have a longer relaxation time @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we present the measurement of elliptic flow @xmath0 of electrons from the semi - leptonic decays of heavy - flavour hadrons in semi - central ( 20 - 40% centrality ) pb - pb collisions at @xmath1 = 2.76 tev with alice .",
    "the elliptic flow is the second fourier coefficient of the azimuthal distribution of particle momenta in the transverse plane with respect to the reaction plane . at low @xmath2",
    ", the @xmath0 of the electrons from heavy - flavour hadron decays is sensitive to the degree of thermalization of charm and beauty quarks in the deconfined medium . at higher @xmath2 , the measurement of @xmath0 carries information on the path length dependence of in - medium parton energy loss .",
    "the analysis was carried out with different methods that have different sensitivity to non - flow contributions , namely event plane @xcite , scalar product @xcite and q - cumulants @xcite .",
    "we compare the experimental result to several theoretical models and with measurements from au - au collisions at @xmath1 = 0.2 tev at rhic @xcite .",
    "the data analyzed were recorded with the alice detector @xcite during the 2010 and 2011 lhc runs with pb - pb collisions at @xmath1 = 2.76 tev .",
    "the vzero detector provides the mb trigger , centrality determination , which is used online to enhance the sample of central and semi - central events , and event plane determination .",
    "in addition to the sample from the semi - central trigger ( 8@xmath3@xmath4 events in the centrality range 20 - 40% ) , a sample of 1.3@xmath3@xmath4 events in 20 - 40% centrality triggered by the electro - magnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) is used .",
    "electron candidates are selected and identified using different approaches . in the low @xmath2 region ( @xmath2 @xmath5 6 gev/@xmath6 ) information from the tpc ( time projection chamber ) and the tof ( time of flight ) detectors",
    "is used , while the emcal contributes to electron identification for 1.5 @xmath5 @xmath2 @xmath5 13 gev/@xmath6 .",
    "particle identification in the tpc is based on the measurement of the specific energy loss de / dx in the detector gas , while in the tof the charged particles are separated via the measurement of their time of flight from the interaction point to the detector .",
    "electron identification in the emcal is based on the measurement of the e / p ratio , where e is the energy of the emcal cluster that was matched to the prolongation of the track with momentum @xmath7 reconstructed in the tpc and its detectors .",
    "electrons deposit their total energy in the emcal and due to their small mass the e / p ratio should be equal to unity .    the sample of identified electron candidates is mainly composed of two distinct sources : electrons from the semi - leptonic decays of hadrons containing a charm or beauty quark , and photonic electrons , originating mainly from dalitz decays of @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons and from photon conversion . in order to extract the heavy - flavour signal , the background contributions have to be subtracted from the inclusive electron spectra and @xmath0 . in this analysis",
    "this task is accomplished using two different methods . in the first method",
    "a cocktail of electron spectra from background sources is calculated using a monte carlo event generator of hadron decays @xcite . in the second method",
    "the electron background is reconstructed using the invariant mass method .",
    "the latter makes use of the fact that an electron from a photonic source is always accompanied by a positron , forming an electron - positron pair with small invariant mass . in the current analysis pairs with a mass below 70 mev/@xmath10",
    "are tagged as photonic .",
    "the heavy - flavour electron @xmath11 was then obtained as :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the inclusive electron @xmath0 , ( 1 + @xmath14 ) is the ratio of inclusive electrons to the estimated background electrons and @xmath15 is the @xmath0 coefficient for the background sources estimated from the cocktail .",
    "the ( 1 + @xmath14 ) was estimated with both methods , cocktail and invariant mass method as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath2 spectra comparing the two different methods is shown in in fig .",
    "[ rsb ]    @xmath16    and a good agreement is observed within statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the @xmath15 estimated for the background with the cocktail is reported in fig .",
    "the transverse momentum dependence of @xmath0 of heavy - flavour decay electrons is shown in fig .",
    "[ fvqef ] @xmath16 for the different methods used in the analysis , which are found to be consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "we observe positive @xmath0 at low @xmath2 in semi - central collisions .",
    "the positive @xmath0 has a contribution from heavy - quark collective flow at low @xmath2 and may be due to the path - length dependence of the energy loss mechanism . in fig .",
    "[ rtht ] the experimental results are compared with measurements by phenix in au - au collisions at rhic at @xmath1 = 0.2 tev @xcite and with various transport model calculations . the @xmath0 measured at the lhc is similar in magnitude to that measured by phenix at lower collision energy .",
