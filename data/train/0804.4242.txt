    "tunneling is a fundamental process related to the dynamics of various kinds of waves .",
    "this phenomenon was already pointed out in gamow s famous work @xcite on nuclear @xmath0-decay , where the probability of penetration of @xmath0-particles with energy @xmath1 through a potential barrier with height @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 ) was found to be exponentially small , but finite .",
    "however , the gurney and condon attempt @xcite to find the velocity @xmath4 and the transit time @xmath5 of such a tunneling revealed a basic problem of the theory ; how should one define these quantities in the  classically forbidden zone ",
    "( @xmath3 ) , where both the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are imaginary ?",
    "three decades later the interest in this problem was renewed in hartmann s paper @xcite , where the time of tunneling of a particle with energy @xmath1 through a barrier was determined via the phase of the complex barrier transmission function @xmath6 , which gives the tunneling time @xmath7 where @xmath8 is planck s constant . using the wellknown expressions for the transmission function of a rectangular barrier with width @xmath9 , hartmann @xcite showed that for the case of a thick barrier ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the particle momentum ) , the time @xmath5 becomes independent of @xmath9 , and thus for a sufficiently thick barrier the tunneling speed @xmath4 can reach the superluminal velocity @xmath12 .",
    "this conclusion , referred to in the literature as the hartmann paradox , can be deduced from standard formula given in many textbooks .",
    "it has stimulated a hot debate which is still going on @xcite .",
    "however , a direct measurement of the electron tunneling time through a quantum barrier has proved to be an intricate task .",
    "the idea to verify hartmann s conclusion by means of the classical effect of electromagnetic ( em ) wave tunneling through macroscopic wave barriers was then proposed .",
    "its basis was the formal similarity between the stationary schrdinger equation and the usual wave equation , describing both propagating and evanescent em modes in continuous media .",
    "this idea gave rise to several attempts to examine the tunneling times of em waves in microwave and optical ranges .",
    "thus , radio wave experiments with tunneling of the @xmath13 mode in an  undersized",
    " metallic waveguide @xcite , were by some authors interpreted in favor of the concept of superluminal phase times for tunneling em waves .",
    "these conclusions were reached by means of the expression @xcite @xmath14 generalizing eq .",
    "( [ eq - time1 ] ) to wave tunneling through a barrier characterized by a complex transmission coefficient .",
    "however , measurements of the group delay time for the fundamental @xmath13 mode near the cut - off frequency had shown that each of the quantities @xmath5 ( [ eq - time1 ] ) and @xmath15 ( [ eq - timeb ] ) correspond to experiments only at some restricted frequency ranges .",
    "tunneling through such homogeneous opaque barriers is accompanied by strong reflections , attenuation and reshaping of the transmitted signal .",
    "the destructive interference between the incident and reflected parts of the pulse was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite as a mechanism for suppressing the tail of the transmitted pulse , causing a superluminal motion of the pulse peak .",
    "another approach to this problem is based on the use of a heterogeneous photonic barrier , characterized by a curvilinear profile of the dielectric susceptibility @xmath16 across the barrier @xcite .",
    "propagation of waves in this geometry is characterized by the following inhomogeneity induced phenomena :    \\a ) the appearance of an easily controlled cut - off frequency @xmath17 , depending on the gradient and curvature of the profile @xmath16 .",
    "\\b ) formation of a tunneling regime for waves with frequency @xmath18 in dielectric media with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "\\c ) reflectionless ( non - attenuative ) tunneling providing 100% transfer of wave energy through a barrier for some frequency @xmath21 .",
    "these properties were examined in refs .",
    "@xcite for thin dielectric nanofilms , characterized by a smooth spatial variation of @xmath16 at the subwavelength nanoscale .",
    "access to such films , being available due to recent progress in nanotechnology @xcite , remains , however , a challenging technological problem .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to unite the advantages of both microwave and optical tunneling systems , to enable measurements of substantial phase shifts of @xmath22 microwaves in the regime of non - attenuative tunneling through heterogeneous dielectric layerss , characterized , unlike the optical system , by cm - scales for the inhomogeneity .",
    "a candidate for such a device is the coaxial transmission line ( tl ) , using the fundamental @xmath23 mode .",
    "this tl is chosen due to the following salient features , resembling the properties of em waves in free space @xcite :    \\a ) the velocity of the @xmath23 mode is known to coincide with the free space light velocity @xmath24 .",
    "\\b ) the polarization structure of the @xmath23 mode contains only the transverse field components of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and not any longitudinal component .",
    "\\c ) the @xmath23 mode does not possess any frequency dispersion .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows : tunneling of the @xmath23 mode through a segment of a coaxial tl , containing a diaphragm made from a gradient dielectric metamaterial is considered in section 2 .",
    "conditions for reflectionless tunneling of a tem wave through this diaphragm , accompanied by a substantial phase shift , are examined in section 3 .",
    "the parameters of an interferometric scheme for measurements of this phase shift are presented in section 4 .",
    "finally , a brief discussion of the results is given in the conclusion ( section 5 ) .",
    "let us consider a coaxial waveguide permitting em wave propagation between two infinitely conducting cylinders with radii @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) shown in fig 1 .",
    "the fundamental @xmath23 mode is assumed to propagate along this waveguide ( @xmath30-direction ) .",
    "the regions @xmath31 ( region 0 ) and @xmath32 ( region 2 ) are assumed to be vacuum , whereas region 1 ( @xmath33 ) is filled with an inhomogeneous dielectric layer , fabricated from a metamaterial , where the dielectric susceptibility is varying such that @xmath34 where @xmath35 ( with @xmath36 and@xmath37 ) is a dimensionless positive function and @xmath38 is the maximum value of @xmath39 reached at the ends @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the inhomogeneous region .",

    "the drastic consequences of this inhomogeneity induced effect for reflectance and transmission of the @xmath23 mode are discussed below .",
    "in order to find the reflectance of the gradient wave barrier , we substitute the formula ( [ eq : boundary-1 ] ) for @xmath94 , into eqs .",

    "3 .   the energy density of the evanescent mode inside the barrier @xmath156 remains positive in each cross - section of the barrier .",
    "it is interesting to evaluate the group time delay for this type of tunneling by means of equations ( [ eq - time1 ] ) and ( [ eq - timeb ] ) . since we consider the case of reflectionless tunneling ( @xmath125 ) , the second term in ( [ eq - timeb ] ) vanishes , and we can use ( [ eq - time1 ] ) . presenting the derivative @xmath157 from ( [ eq : phase ] )",

    "in conclusion , we stress the following points :    1 .   the possibility of reflectionless tunneling of microwave tem mode in a coaxial waveguide with a gradient profile ( i.e.  gradient media ) given by @xmath170 has here been examined in the framework of an exactly solvable model . this model describes the effects of heterogeneity - induced dispersion and the controlled formation of a cut - off frequency @xmath17 in the wanted spectral range . unlike evanescent waves in lorentz media with a natural local dispersion @xcite ,",
    "the tunneling of lf modes ( @xmath171 ) arises in gradient media due to non - local dispersion .",
    "2 .   in contrast to the traditional concept of tunneling in media with @xmath172 , another mechanism of tunneling , with @xmath19 but @xmath173 , has been considered here . the possibility of a superluminal phase shift , arising in subwavelength wave barriers ( beyond hartmann s condition @xmath174 ) , is demonstrated .",
    "an experimental setup , illustrating such tunneling , is suggested .",
    "3 .   the results , obtained here for microwaves , can easily be generalized to other types of em waves , keeping the condition of a constant product @xmath175 , with the other parameters of tunneling media being the same .",
