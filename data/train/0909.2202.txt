    "the three - dimensional(@xmath5 ) layered magnetic spin systems in which the strength of the interactions among the layers is much smaller than within the layers , are often referred to as quasi - two - dimensional .",
    "although strictly two - dimensional(@xmath6 ) magnetic systems do not exist in nature , their statistical mechanics can be studied by experimenting with diverse more mundane structures and in particular by exploring how quasi - two - dimensional systems@xcite crossover , i.e. change their universality class , on going from the @xmath5 to the @xmath6 critical regime . from a more general standpoint , the study of spatially anisotropic systems also provides the simplest example of a wide variety of crossover phenomena @xcite of different origin which may occur near criticality .",
    "the simplest hamiltonian which can model a quasi - two - dimensional magnetic system , in the absence of a magnetic field , is that of an @xmath7-vector spin model with axially anisotropic couplings @xmath8 we have indicated by @xmath9 an @xmath7-component classical spin - vector of unit length located at the site @xmath10 of a simple - cubic ( @xmath11 ) lattice .",
    "the first sum in ( [ tnhamilt ] ) is extended to the nearest - neighbor ( @xmath12 ) spin pairs within each horizontal _ ( xy ) _ layer , while the second sum is over the @xmath12 spins in adjacent layers along the _ z_-direction .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath13 the ratio of the interlayer to the intralayer coupling strength which characterizes the spatial anisotropy of the spin couplings and therefore is sometimes referred to as _",
    "anisotropy parameter_. the thermodynamic quantities of the model can be expressed as functions of the variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the boltzmann constant .",
    "one may , equivalently , choose either the pair of variables @xmath17 and @xmath4 or the pair @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "for @xmath20 , the system becomes a stack of non - interacting spin layers .",
    "when @xmath21 , the system has directionally isotropic interactions . for @xmath22 , or equivalently for @xmath23 , it reduces to an array of non - interacting spin chains .    only a few pioneering studies@xcite of the hamiltonian ( [ tnhamilt ] ) by high - temperature(ht ) methods are presently available",
    "they were aimed at :    \\1 ) a numerical test of the critical universality@xcite for the anisotropic system , in particular of the @xmath4-independence of the critical exponents as long as @xmath24 ;    \\2 ) an investigation of the change of universality class of the critical transition as @xmath20 , i.e. of the crossover from the @xmath11 to the square - lattice critical behavior .",
    "they relied on ht series expansions , in terms of the two variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 , computed through 11th order@xcite for @xmath25 ( the spin @xmath26 ising model ) and through 10th order@xcite for @xmath27 ( the planar rotator or @xmath0 model ) or @xmath28 ( the classical heisenberg model ) , on the @xmath11 lattice .",
    "the corresponding expansions for the face - centered - cubic lattice also reached the same orders . altogether",
    "78 coefficients were computed in the @xmath11-lattice ising case and 66 coefficients in the other cases but , unfortunately , no higher order coefficients were added since . in the ising case , although rather short , the expansions are sufficiently well behaved that their extrapolations can support unambiguously the simplest theoretical expectations concerning the crossover .",
    "the accuracy of the first series analyses in the ising case could be only marginally improved@xcite by resorting to bivariate partial - differential approximants@xcite ( i.e. by approximately resumming the ht expansions in terms of the solution of a linear first - order _ partial _ differential equation with appropriately chosen bivariate polynomial coefficients ) instead of using the conventional ratio or pad approximant ( pa ) methods .",
    "the reason of this failure is that there is no substitute for significantly longer expansions .",
    "later on , also several montecarlo simulations@xcite were carried out in an attempt at further clarifying the crossover behavior of ising systems , but the accuracy of the results is still subject to controversy for small positive @xmath4 , i.e. in the region of main interest . on the other hand , for the models with @xmath29 , the earliest ht analyses were inconclusive , thus calling for a substantial extension of the expansions .",
    "in particular , the crossover issue remained to be studied , because even the existence of a critical point at nonzero temperature and the nature of the critical singularity in the @xmath6 limit were not yet firmly assessed at the time of the first analyses .",
    "also the successive simulation studies , carried out when the critical behaviors in @xmath6 of the @xmath27 model@xcite ( and of the @xmath30 models@xcite ) were better understood , probably can not yet be considered sufficiently accurate@xcite or are not directly comparable@xcite with the series analyses .",
    "we have been motivated by this situation to devote our study to the @xmath27 anisotropic model , taking advantage of our recent extensions through order 21 , ( i.e. from 66 to 253 series coefficients ) , of the bivariate ht expansions for the two - spin correlation - function and its moments on the @xmath11 lattice .",
    "another reason of interest into this model is that it has been suggested to provide an approximate description of layered high-@xmath31 superconductors@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we briefly mention the algorithm adopted and specify the results of our series computations . in sec.iii",
    ", we discuss some of the simplest predictions of the extended phenomenological scaling theory for the crossover from the @xmath5 to the @xmath6 ( and from the @xmath5 to the @xmath32 ) critical behavior .",
    "we begin by reviewing in some detail the well studied @xmath25 case only to recall the general ideas of this approach and to contrast its features with those of the less studied and more complex @xmath33 cases . in sec.iv",
    ", we outline our numerical analysis of the expansions and compare the results with the theoretical expectations .",
    "we should finally notice that , throughout this report , for reasons of clarity , we have used a notation sometimes different and heavier , but more detailed and perhaps more explicit , than that generally adopted in the earliest studies of the crossover phenomena .",
    "our computation of the series coefficients was carried out using a computerized recursive algorithm based on the schwinger - dyson equations@xcite .",
    "this method was initially applied only to the determination of single - variable ht expansions . only recently , taking advantage of the great improvements of the computer performances of the last decades , it could be straightforwardly adapted@xcite to derive also the more memory - demanding and computationally - intensive bivariate expansions for a wide class of isotropic and anisotropic @xmath0 models with @xmath12 and next - to-@xmath12 interactions .",
    "it should be noted that in our approach only extended - integer exact arithmetic is used , thus avoiding all roundoff errors which limited the precision of the preceding@xcite floating - point computations .",
    "to give an idea of the performance of the algorithm , let us note that an ordinary single - processor desktop personal - computer(_pc _ ) can complete , in less than a second , all 10th - order calculations for the anisotropic @xmath27 case so far documented@xcite in the literature .",
    "the calculation of the next nine orders takes a few days . to compute the last two orders , we have used a _",
    "pc_-cluster for a time equivalent to approximately six months of a single _",

    "the second - moment correlation - length is expressed , in terms of @xmath40 and @xmath41 as @xmath42 ^ 2 = { m^{(2)}}(n;k_1,r)/2d\\chi(n;k_1,r ) .",
    "\\label{corlen}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the lattice dimensionality i.e. @xmath44 for @xmath45 , @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath48 otherwise .",
    "usually , for the univariate ht expansions , the only accessible validation procedure of an extended computation is the comparison with the lower - order results that might be already known . in the case at hand",
    ", only the expansion coefficients of the second moment of the correlation - function are tabulated through 10th order in ref .",
    "[ ] , but they contain small roundoff errors in the 8th figure at highest order .",
    "after correction of these errors they agree with our results .",
    "of course , this is not a very stringent test of correctness .",
    "however , the extended expansions can be subjected , at all orders , to additional tests , some of which deriving from equations of section iii .",
    "first , we can check that , taking @xmath21 , the coefficients of the single - variable expansions for the corresponding quantities of the isotropic @xmath5 @xmath0 model , already known@xcite through order 21 , are reproduced .",
    "moreover , we can observe that for @xmath47 and @xmath45 , the expansions of @xmath49 and @xmath50 reduce , as they should , to those of the corresponding quantities in the @xmath6@xcite and the @xmath32 @xmath0 model , respectively .",
    "finally , we take advantage of eqs .",
    "( [ parder ] ) and ( [ parder1d ] ) of the next section , in the case of the susceptibility , ( or eqs .",
    "( [ parderm ] ) and ( [ parderm1d ] ) for the second moment ) , to pin down two more among the @xmath51 series coefficients occurring at the @xmath52th order .",
    "the success of this variety of tests , through all orders we have computed , strengthens the confidence that our extensions of the bivariate expansions are correct .",
    "our series data for the @xmath12 correlations , the susceptibility and the second moment of the correlation function are tabulated in an appendix , which for editorial reasons was not included in the printed version @xcite of this paper .",
    "for all values of @xmath7 , at fixed @xmath24 , the @xmath5 spin models described by the hamiltonian eq.([tnhamilt ] ) display a conventional power - law critical transition . as the reduced deviation @xmath53 from the critical point @xmath54 of the @xmath5 system with anisotropy parameter @xmath4 tends to zero from above , for the susceptibility one has @xmath55^{-\\gamma(n;r)}$ ] , while for the correlation - length one has @xmath56^{-\\nu(n;r)}$ ] .",
    "the universality hypothesis@xcite dictates that , for a given value of @xmath7 , the critical exponents @xmath57 of the susceptibility and @xmath58 of the correlation - length of the @xmath7-vector system with arbitrary finite anisotropy should be independent of @xmath4 as long as @xmath24 and thus should coincide with the exponents @xmath59 and @xmath60 of the isotropic system .",
    "the initial part of our analysis of the ht expansions in the subsections a and b of section iv , will be devoted to the determination of the critical temperature and exponents as functions of @xmath4 for @xmath24 , thus making it possible to test numerically the universality of the exponents with respect to @xmath4 .    when @xmath20 the @xmath11 lattice system crosses over to a stack of uncoupled square - lattice systems and we expect that an anomalous behavior at criticality indicates a discontinuous change of universality class .",
    "the crossover behavior is described by a phenomenological scaling theory introduced in ref . [ ] and subsequently extended and clarified in refs .",
    "this approach , whose validity has been verified in the mean - field approximation and in the spherical model@xcite , is first outlined for @xmath25 ( the ising model ) in the subsection a and then generalized to cover also the case @xmath33 , in the subsection b. the predictions of the scaling theory for @xmath27 will finally be compared to the ht - based approximations in the subsection c of section iv .",
    "an anomalous behavior is also expected to occur in the @xmath23 limit in which the @xmath11 lattice crosses over to the linear lattice .      for @xmath25 , both the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 @xmath7-vector models display a power - law critical behavior .",
    "as a consequence , for all critical exponents @xmath61 , @xmath62 , of the @xmath5 ising model with anisotropy @xmath4 , the @xmath20 limit exists and yields the corresponding exponents @xmath63 , @xmath64 of the @xmath6 ising model .",
    "thus , for @xmath65 , one can write @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the critical region . for brevity , only in this subsection we have set @xmath68 .",
    "the crossover from the @xmath5 to the @xmath6 critical behavior , as @xmath20 , can be described in terms of a direct generalization@xcite of the usual phenomenological scaling hypothesis valid for isotropic systems .",
    "specifically , it is assumed that , for sufficiently small @xmath69 and @xmath4 , the scaling form of the singular part @xmath70 of the free energy in a field @xmath71 embodies also the anisotropy parameter @xmath4 as follows @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a universal function .",
    "the exponents @xmath74 and @xmath75 refer to the specific heat and the magnetization of the @xmath6 ising model .",
    "the quantity @xmath76 , called _ crossover exponent _ , is universal and must coincide@xcite with @xmath63 , the exponent of the susceptibility of the @xmath6 ising model . taking two derivatives with respect to @xmath71 in eq.([freescalising ] )",
    "one obtains that the susceptibility in zero field is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 , called universal _",

    "what follows , a superscript zero is attached to all quantities related to the 0th moment of the correlation - function .",
    "the scaling forms eqs.([freescalising ] ) and ( [ scalising ] ) provide an interpolation between the critical behaviors in @xmath6 ( i.e. for @xmath47 ) and in @xmath5 , for small non - vanishing @xmath4 , and thus can describe both of them .",
    "in particular , by the normalization of @xmath78 , eq.([scalising ] ) is consistent with the @xmath6 critical behavior eq.([chiasising ] ) of the susceptibility in @xmath6 . on the other hand , the consistency of eq.([scalising ] ) with the @xmath5 critical behavior @xmath82^{-\\gamma(1;r)}$ ]",

    "these simulation data seem to suggest a qualitatively different behavior as @xmath20 .",
    "we must therefore suppose that they are affected by large errors ( unfortunately not assessed in ref .",
    "[ ] ) from underestimated finite - size effects , because the volume of the simulated system was small ( at most @xmath224 ) and no finite - size - scaling analysis was performed .",
    "a more recent simulation@xcite , also carried out with @xmath224 sized systems , and extending to much smaller values of @xmath4 , is likely to suffer from similar problems , although its results seem to show a better agreement with ours .",
    "some remarks have to be made on fig.[anisf3sq ] .",
    "firstly , one should be aware that a logarithmic behavior is quite difficult to identify numerically by using data which refer to only a two - decade variation of the independent variable , since , over a restricted range , it can also be well represented as a power - law behavior with a small exponent .",
    "moreover the choice of the window of values of @xmath4 to be studied , is a delicate issue , because the upper end of the window should be sufficiently small that both the crossover - scaling assumptions and the asymptotic behavior eq.([tcr2 ] ) apply with small corrections , while the lower end should be sufficiently large that our estimates of the critical temperature are not too uncertain . in our case",
    "the value of @xmath225 can be varied by a factor of two or more , still obtaining good fits of the same functional form , with not very different values of the parameters @xmath226 and @xmath227 . finally , we observe that the best - fit value of @xmath226 is not very different from its expected value @xmath228 , while the value of @xmath227 is much larger .",
    "it is reasonable to interpret these results as an indication that @xmath229 is still too large and therefore the higher - order corrections to the asymptotic form eq.([tcr2 ] ) , suppressed only by inverse powers of @xmath230 , are still important , so that @xmath226 and @xmath227 can only be effective parameters . to conclude , in spite of the notable extension of the ht expansions we have analyzed",
    ", these results still can give only a suggestive indication that our estimates of the critical temperature for small @xmath4 are compatible with the predicted asymptotic behavior eq.([tcr2 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , one might wish to describe also this crossover behavior by a power law and fit an expression @xmath231 , of the same form as eq.([tcr ] ) valid in the @xmath25 case , to the same small-@xmath4 sample of our data points .",
    "we then find the following values of the parameters : @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "we have displayed also this fit in fig.[anisf3sq ] .",
    "thus , if for consistency we describe also the critical behavior of the @xmath6 @xmath0 model in terms of conventional power laws , this result suggests an unusually large susceptibility exponent , i.e. @xmath234 .",
    "we can also observe that , subdividing the small-@xmath4 range into two intervals , this kind of fit would yield a smaller exponent @xmath235 in the leftmost interval .",
    "this suggests that even smaller values of the exponent @xmath235 ( and thus larger values of the susceptibility exponent ) are likely to be found , if it were possible to further reduce both ends of the window of values of @xmath4 under consideration , for example by using future significantly longer ht expansions .",
    "it is then reasonable to believe that this power - law crossover is only apparent , because the exponent is @xmath4-dependent and vanishes as @xmath20 , and hence that we are actually representing a genuine logarithmic behavior as a power - law behavior .    in fig.[anisf3_1sur ] , we have plotted @xmath236 vs @xmath237 .",
    "the behavior of the curve as @xmath23 also gives some support to the validity of eq.([tcr2b ] ) and therefore it confirms the generalized scaling approach to the crossover from @xmath5 to @xmath32 .",
    "unfortunately , so far we have computed expansions only for the @xmath11 lattice structure and therefore our verification of the universality of certain quantities does not include their lattice independence , but is limited to a test of their independence on @xmath4 .    in the range @xmath188 , in which our computation of the critical temperature was completely unbiased , we have also evaluated both the critical exponents @xmath148 and @xmath149 by using second - order das , chosen in the above specified class and biased with our estimates of @xmath184 .",
    "we have also determined , by simple first - order das , the ratio of the logarithmic derivatives of @xmath238 and @xmath239 , whose value at @xmath184 yields the ratio @xmath240 . in fig.[anisf21 ] , we have plotted vs @xmath4 our estimates of these exponents and of their ratio normalized to our estimates of @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 , respectively .",

    "these results support the universality with respect to @xmath4 of the critical behavior for the anisotropic @xmath5 model .",
    "it is fair to note that , while the deviations of our exponent estimates for the anisotropic system from those for the @xmath21 system are uniformly very small , our estimates of @xmath200 and @xmath245 are larger , by @xmath246 , than the most recent@xcite estimates @xmath247 and @xmath248 . on the contrary",
    ", the deviation of our estimates of the exponent ratio from its recent determination @xmath249 is quite small . substantially longer",
