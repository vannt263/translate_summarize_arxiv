    "gravitational lensing results from the deflection of light under the gravitational influence of all matter , luminous or otherwise .",
    "its physics is clean , and this effect has allowed the measurement of the distribution of dark matter from galaxy - scales ( using strong lensing ) to the large - scale structure of the universe ( using weak lensing ) .",
    "usually , many approximations are made to simplify the calculations .",
    "one of these is the born approximation , where one calculates a small deflection along the unperturbed light path .",
    "some effects , such as image rotation due to multi - plane lensing , are not accessible in this approximation .",
    "authors have obtained different results for the magnitude of multi - plane weak lensing rotation ( jain et al 2000 , cooray & hu 2002 , hereafter ch ; hirata & seljak 2003 , hereafter hs ) .",
    "schneider ( 1997 ) showed that a strong lens plus spatially constant weak lens system is mathematically identical to some other single lens plane system , so only differential rotation at the image positions is observable .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the multiple plane lensing calculation to real physical systems : quadruply imaged quasars .",
    "we show in this physical example how the rotation effect can be measured , why it is physical and real , estimate its magnitude , and show how it can be used to resolve the substructure controversy .",
    "the rotation of images is of current interests in the context of using gravitational lensing to detect substructures predicted by the cold dark matter ( cdm ) structure formation model . from both semi - analytical studies and numerical simulations ,",
    "it became clear that hundreds of subhaloes ( substructures ) are predicted to exist in a milky - way type halo ( e.g. , kauffmann et al . 1993 ; klypin et al .",
    "1999 ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ; ghigna et al .",
    "2000 ) . in general ,",
    "about 5 - 10% of the mass is predicted to be in substructures , with a typical mass spectrum of @xmath1 .",
    "if all the substructures form stars , then the predicted number of satellite galaxies exceeds the observed number in a milky - way type halo by a large factor .",
    "it is now , however , clear that the correspondence between substructures and visible satellite galaxies is not simple ( gao et al .",
    "2004a , b ; see also springel et al .",
    "2001 ; diemand , moore & stadel 2004 ; nagi & kravtsov 2005 ) .",
    "in particular , if only some substructures house satellite galaxies , then the discrepancy can be alleviated ( e.g. , kravtsov et al . 2004 ) . at present , it is not entirely clear whether the internal kinematics of satellite galaxies are consistent with observations ( stoehr et al .",
    "2002 ; kazantzidis et al .",
    "furthermore , the spatial distribution of satellite galaxies in the milky way is also somewhat puzzling ( kroupa et al .",
    "2004 , but see kang et al . 2005 ; liebeskind et al . 2005 ; zentner et al .",
    "2005 ) .    one possible way to detect the ( dark ) substructures is through the gravitational lensing effect .",
    "simple analytical models in gravitational lenses often fail to reproduce the observed flux ratios ( e.g. , kochanek 1991 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is commonly referred to as the `` anomalous flux ratio problem . ''",
    "this has been proposed as evidence for substructures in the primary lensing galaxies ( e.g. , mao & schneider 1998 ; metcalf & zhao 2002 ; dalal & kochanek 2002 ) .",
    "however , as most of the predicted substructures are in the outer part of the lensing galaxies while the lensed images are typically at a projected distance of only a few kpc from the center , it is unclear whether the predicted amount of substructures in lensing galaxies by cdm is sufficient ( kochanek & dalal 2004 ; mao et al .",
    "2004 ) , so it is important to consider other sources of `` substructures . ''",
    "recently , metcalf ( 2005 ) proposed that substructures along the line of sight can equally explain the discrepancy .",
    "a key question naturally arises : how do we know that substructures are from the primary lens or from elsewhere along the line of sight ?    in this paper , we examine the rotation of images induced by structures along the line of sight in gravitational lenses ( see also chen et al .",
    "we use a novel power - spectrum approach and consider the fluctuations of surface densities among different images ( separated by few tenths to few arc seconds ) and their effects on the magnifications . throughout this paper , we adopt the `` concordance '' @xmath2 cosmology ( e.g. , ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ; spergel et al . 2003 and references therein ) , with a density parameter @xmath3 , a cosmological constant @xmath4 , a baryon density parameter @xmath5 , and the power - spectrum normalization @xmath6 . we adopt a hubble constant of @xmath7 .",
    "many multiply - imaged gravitational lenses on galaxy - scales have been observed . at the time of writing ,",
    "roughly 100 such systems are known .",
    "the largest systematic survey , the cosmic lens all sky survey ( class ) has found 22 new galaxy - scale lenses , approximately one half of which are quadruple lenses ( browne et al .",
    "2003 ; myers et al .",
    "most of these have high - resolution imaging from @xmath8 to mas from merlin , hst to vlbi .",
    "several of these lenses are resolved into multiple components .",
    "the system 0128 + 437 provides a good example ( biggs et al .",
    "each of the image has been resolved into three sub - components with vlbi .",
    "such high - resolution images provide an excellent test bed for lensing models .",
    "in addition to the strong lens system which causes the multiple image splitting , all the matter along the line of sight will further deflect the light and contribute to distortions in the image .",
    "one such effect is the apparent rotation of images .",
    "it can be shown that a single plane lens has a symmetric amplification matrix , which shears but does not rotate images . with multiple planes ,",
    "image rotation is possible . observing it may appear non - trivial , since it would require prior knowledge of the unlensed image alignment .",
    "we will show below ( see  3 ) how this can actually be measured if one has a quadruply imaged source with extended structures .",
    "several geometric configurations can lead to image rotation .",
    "a strong lens has shear and convergence of order unity . with sufficiently accurate alignment",
    ", a second strong lens could occur along the line of sight .",
    "indeed such an example has already been seen ",
    "the jvas / class lens system , b2114 + 022 ( augusto et al . 2001 ; chae , mao & augusto 2001 ) , has two lensing galaxies at redshifts 0.3157 and 0.5883 respectively , within 2 arc seconds of quadruple radio sources .",
    "but in general , the expected variation in surface density due to dark matter is small . integrating the limber equation",
    ", this leads to large scale structure density variations of order a few percent of the critical surface density ( e.g. , jain et al 2000 ) .",
    "so a random cluster lens will typically only have weak lenses in its foreground and background .",
    "the typical splitting angle of the strong lens is around one arc second .",
    "large scale structure density fluctuations on such scales are significantly correlated . since schneider ( 1997 )",
    "had shown that perfectly correlated weak lensing screens do not cause observable rotation , one must compute the differential weak lensing shear .    the cross correlation between two image positions separated by angle @xmath9",
    "is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the two dimensional fourier ( bessel ) transform of equation ( [ eqn : limber ] ) which will be discussed below .",
    "the results are shown for four quadruple lenses with known lens and source redshifts , b1422 + 231 ( patnaik et al .",
    "1992 ) , mg0414 + 0534 ( hewitt et al .",
    "1992 ) , b1608 + 656 ( myers et al .",
    "1995 ) , and b2045 + 265 ( fassnacht et al . 1999 ) .",
    "we find a ratio of variances between the difference of two images @xmath12 and the individual variances to be = 2(1-r ) . if the two images are uncorrelated , the difference will have twice the variances of each individual image .",
    "figure [ fig : corr ] shows the correlation function vs. image separation .",
    "as can be seen , typically we have @xmath13 , so the difference mode has a slightly lower variance than each individual image .    ) for different image pairs induced by the large - scale structure ; the correlation function at zero lag is the variance in @xmath14 .",
    "the boxes indicate the largest and smallest splittings for four class lenses with known lens and source redshifts . because splitting angles are small , the @xmath14 by the large - scale structure at different image positions is strongly correlated .",
    "the variance from large scale structure shear at each image position is the correlation function at zero lag .",
    "the covariance for images separated by a lag @xmath9 can be seen in the plots . since the covariance ( at typical image separations ) is of comparable size of to the auto - variance , which leads to a supression of the differential shear mode .",
    ", height=340 ]    we assume that the various images pass through different parts of the strong lens with correspondingly different values of shear and convergence , and also differing weak lens deflectors .",

    "if one wishes to observe this effect , several challenges must be overcome .",
    "sources must have at least three localizable components , and the position of each must be measured very precisely , to better than 1% of the component separation .",
    "positions are also affected by changes in the lens from one component position to the next .",
    "the latter effect is expected to be significantly smaller than rotation , because it depends on the change in shear on small scales , while the rotation depends on the large scale structure shear itself . basically , the rotation is of order of the large scale structure shear .",
    "the variation of the large scale structure shear on source substructure scales is smaller than the shear itself .",
    "we quantify this as follows : let us assume that the components of the lens have a separation of 10 mas .",
    "the model assumed that the shear was constant over the apparent size of the source .",
    "the change in shear across the lens is given by @xmath100 . from figure",
    "[ fig : corr ] we see that @xmath14 has a differential variance of around @xmath101 at this separation , corresponding to a percent change in lensed length scales .",
    "this is of comparable magnitude to the rotation effect , which makes it desirable to have more than three components to check . in practice ,",
    "the actual lensing substructure is suppressed by several factors .",
    "figure [ fig : corr ] shows the weak lensing correlation in the absence of a strong lens .",
    "lines converge behind the lens , which reduces the corresponding physical scales , and thus the total variance . and only the variation in shear principle axes across three sub - image positions affects the rotation , which is suppressed by another dimensionless factor .",
    "it is worth noting that hs proved that the rotation @xmath54 is identical to the b - mode of the shear , up to a constant . in this calculation",
    ", we only considered the local value of shears , while the e - b decomposition is non - local .",
    "we therefore should consider the 4 entries in the magnification matrix to be independent . in principle , if one had a very high number density of background sources , for example from reionization ( pen 2004 ) , one could also solve for the strong lensing e - b decomposed map ( pen 2000 ) .",
    "such a decomposition also allows one to distinguish between structures in the strong lens plane , and contributions from large scale structure along the line of sight .",
    "the signal to noise required for such an exercise is difficult to achieve with current technology .",
    "using quadruply imaged sources allows one to reduce the pairwise noise , and thus solve for the rotational component .",
    "we also note that our calculation did not use the born approximation .",
    "we modeled each lens plane by a quadratic potential as inferred from the @xmath14 correlation function , and computed the full deflection trajectories .",
    "recently , calculations of rotations by large scale structure at different lens planes resulted in different answers , depending on whether calculations were done with light rays ( hs ) or with shears on light bundles ( ch ) . in the ch calculation ,",
    "ray bundles were propagated on unperturbed trajectories , but distortions were accumulated .",
    "the distortions are relative deflections of neighboring rays , which accumulate rotations through the same effect as discussed in this paper .",
    "this allows ch to see rotation without considering the explicit deflection of the centers of each ray . in terms of a full taylor expansion of light rays along unperturbed paths ,",
    "this includes some of the effects beyond the born approximation .",
    "hs included all leading order corrections to the born approximation , and thus differed in their answer . in our case , the angular scales involved are very small , and we can assume the rotation to be dominated by the common large scale structure shear at different image positions .",
    "the ch and hs approaches do not differ in our model , since the potential is taken to be quadratic , and all second derivatives are constant .",
    "our result differ from that of schneider ( 1997 ) in the nature of the effect .",
    "schneider ( 1997 ) constructs an equivalent single plane strong lens from a strong lens plus constant weak shear .",
    "our calculation circumvents the assumption that the weak lens screen is spatially constant .",
    "our model assumes a source plane consisting of three compact components with unknown positions .",
    "if all three components are quadruply lensed , there are a total of 12 angular positions , i.e. , we have 24 observables .",
    "we subtract 8 degrees of freedom for the global lens model , because we do not know the macroscopic lens deflection angle .",
    "this leaves 16 constraints .",
    "then using equation ( [ eqn : solve_rotate ] ) we can solve for the relative positions in the source plane modulo a scaling ( due to the mass sheet degeneracy ) , which is three numbers , as well as the values of the amplification matrix at each image position , which is four sets of 3 numbers , plus one rotation , for a total of 16 parameters .",
    "this suggests that small scale structure in a single lens is observationally distinguishable from weak shear at a different redshift .",
    "we have made several approximations , which will affect the results at some level .",
    "we used the difference in shears at the two furthest image positions . in the analysis",
    ", we then assumed that three of the images had no rotation , and only the furthest accounted for the multi - plane rotation .",
    "reality is more complex , and all images have differential weak lensing shear , and thus some level of differential rotation .",
    "simulations are needed to quantify this simplifying assumption .    in this paper , we have concentrated on the rotation induced by the weak large - scale structure . however , for the cases where one has multiple lenses along the line of sight , the rotation can be more significant . for the best - fit model in chae ,",
    "mao & augusto ( 2001 ) , we find that the two jacobian matrices are given by j= ,   , for images a and d , corresponding to magnifications @xmath102 and @xmath103 respectively .",
    "clearly for the more highly magnified image @xmath93 , the jacobian is highly asymmetric and the rotation is quite significant .",
    "we have computed the expected rotation from uncorrelated foreground and background large scale structure in strong lensing systems .",
    "we have shown that this effect is in principle observable with precise vlbi imaging of quadruply imaged lens systems .",
    "the rotation is physical and observable in the example of a source plane consisting of three point sources . if observed , it can unambiguously determine if the flux anomaly problem is caused by substructure on the lens plane , or by uncorrelated structures along the line of sight .",
    "in addition , it demonstrates how one can extract information about small scale dark matter structure along the line of sight to a lens . a measurement of rotation would measure the variance of @xmath14 from large scale structure at the smallest scales .",
    "this affects the scatter in supernovae lensing effects , and may have potential to measure the primordial power on small scales , and possibly a tilt or running spectral index .",
