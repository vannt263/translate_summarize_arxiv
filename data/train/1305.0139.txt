    "for a given time @xmath0 , we consider the hamiltonian @xmath26 given by @xmath27 where for a set @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the ( inner ) vertex - boundary of @xmath28 .",
    "the associated gibbs measure on random paths @xmath30 is obtained by considering the measure @xmath24 defined by @xmath31 on @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath32 is a positive number playing the role of inverse temperature and @xmath33 is a normalizing factor called the partition function . in plain words ,",
    "the gibbs measure @xmath24 penalizes every site on the boundary of the range @xmath34 by a fixed amount @xmath35 .",
    "hence @xmath24 favours  highly condensed \" configurations . interpreting the random walk @xmath36 as a chain of monomers , the gibbs measure @xmath24 represents the law of a diluted polymer in a poor solvent . with a constraint on the maximal volume and a boundary penalization , the random set @xmath34 may be seen as a random walk construction of the wulff crystal droplet with inverse temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the wulff construction ( @xcite ) is a method to determine the equilibrium shape of crystals based on surface energy minimization . until now this has been studied rigorously in the context of percolation and the ising model .",
    "as far as we aware , this is the first attempt to study the question through random walks . in the percolation context , rigorous derivation of the limiting shape were first given by alexander , chayes and chayes @xcite in two dimensions , while in the context of the ising model , this was achieved in a nearly simultaneous and independent way in a celebrated work of dobrushin , koteck and shlosman @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a recent monograph giving a detailed overview of the subject",
    ".    we will be interested in describing the geometry of the shape of @xmath34 in the low temperature regime , where @xmath37 is sufficiently large .",
    "our main result gives precise estimates for the condensation effect that results from the self - interaction in dimension 2 . if @xmath38 , let @xmath39 denote the ( euclidean ) diameter of @xmath28 : @xmath40    [ t:2dimgibbs ]    1 .",

    ". 2 .   for all @xmath6 we also have for all @xmath42 , @xmath46 with @xmath47-probability tending to 1 as @xmath48 , where the constants @xmath49 and @xmath50 depend only on @xmath1 .",
    "the exponent @xmath51 in theorem [ t:2dimgibbs ] in the case @xmath5 is in agreement with the physics predictions , which asserts that the radius of gyration has exponent @xmath52 .",
    "note that the proof gives precise estimates on the probability of these events , as well as estimates on the partition function @xmath53 .",
    "we refer the reader to theorem [ t:2dimgibbs+ ] for a precise statement , and refer to open problem [ conj : square ] and the following paragraph for a precise conjecture on the geometry of @xmath34 when @xmath5 .",
    "we note that in dimensions @xmath54 , we strongly conjecture that @xmath55 scales like @xmath8 , but we have only obtained a lower bound .",
    "our proof indicates this , but the upper bound is elusive ( roughly because of topological complications in dimensions @xmath56 ) .",
    "nevertheless we still manage to get an upper bound on the volume which is consistent with this conjecture .",
    "this difficulty is a common feature of all works on wulff crystal .",
    "a related problem was studied by e. bolthausen @xcite . in that work ,",
    "the energy @xmath57 serving to define the gibbs measure @xmath24 in is taken to be @xmath58 , the size of the range ( as opposed to that of its boundary ) .",
    "thus @xmath59 .",
    "bolthausen s result is that the random walk condensates to a set of diameter @xmath60 , which is close in the hausdorff sense to a euclidean ball of that diameter . in both problems , good bounds on the partition functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 play a crucial role . in the case where the energy is just the volume",
    ", we have @xmath63 , and precise asymptotics for this quantity were already obtained by donsker and varadhan @xcite .",
    "this is a considerably easier problem than the one considered here , essentially because @xmath64 is  almost \" a continuous function of its local time profile , viewed as a probability measure on @xmath65 . in particular , the powerful machinery of large deviations theory provides the right tools to study this question .",
    "this goes a long way in explaining the appearance of the euclidean ball as a limit shape , and explains why the inverse temperature @xmath2 is not a relevant parameter in that model .",
    "in contrast , here we believe that the limit shape depends on @xmath2 and is not a rotationally symmetric ball .",
    "it may even contain some flat faces .",
    "so the microscopic geometry of the lattice is important even to determine the macroscopic shape of the random walk cluster , and thus there is no hope in directly applying the large deviations machinery to the problem .",
    "instead , we perform a suitable change of measure and obtain quantitative estimates to derive the lower bound on the partition function .",
    "this is the main technical part of the paper .",
    "once this is done , we rely on a discrete isoperimetric inequality to deal efficiently with the huge entropy coming from the many possible shapes of the range .",
    "our technique is sufficiently robust that it yields similar results for a number of models which turn out to be quite closely related .",
    "one interesting case is the following conditioning , initially suggested by itai benjamini in private communication with the first author . for @xmath66 , define the event @xmath67 as follows : @xmath68 this gives a uniform lower bound on the density of local time uniformly over the range @xmath34 .",
    "this also favours highly condensed configurations . in benjamini s original question",
    ", it was assumed that @xmath69 as @xmath48 .",
    "the question was to decide whether , conditional on the event @xmath67 , there is a shape theorem for the range @xmath34 .    as we will see later on",
    "( see for instance ) , the conditioning also heavily penalizes shapes @xmath34 with large boundaries : essentially , every point on the boundary penalizes the shape by a factor of order @xmath70 , and so it is not surprising that a behaviour similar to theorem [ t:2dimgibbs ] occurs . in particular , the conditioning is already highly nontrivial when @xmath71 is a fixed constant .",
    "this is perhaps couterintuitive initially .",
    "however , unlike in theorem [ t:2dimgibbs ] , we will need an assumption that @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is an explicit constant : @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the connective constant of @xmath76 .",
    "( in dimension @xmath54 , that constant takes a different value related to a notion of self - avoiding surfaces , see for the definition ) .",

    "another variant consists in taking a slightly different hamiltonian @xmath82 , defined by @xmath83 thus the penalisation takes into account not only the size of the boundary , but also the amount of time spent on it .",

    "our choice of @xmath94 is determined by the following requirements .",
    "we wish the random walk under @xmath89 to spend most of its time in the bulk of @xmath99 , but _ also _ visit the boundary @xmath100 sufficiently often that a typical point on the boundary will be visited @xmath101 times , and visit all but a very small number of points inside @xmath99 .",
    "this forces us to have @xmath102 for @xmath103 in the  bulk \" of @xmath99 , and @xmath104 on the boundary .",
    "the distribution @xmath94 must then interpolate  smoothly \" between these two extremes . as it turns out though",
    ", it is the smoothness of @xmath105 which will really matter ( because the donsker ",
    "varadhan cost of achieving a profile @xmath94 is , roughly speaking , the dirichlet energy of @xmath105 ) .",
    "for that reason , the natural choice of @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the distance to the boundary , will not give us the correct entropic cost and we need to choose a profile which grows a bit slower near the boundary , and has the correct growth in the bulk .",
    "the specific choice of @xmath94 is as follows . for @xmath108 let @xmath109 .",
    "then for @xmath110 , set @xmath111 let @xmath112 for @xmath113 , and the constant @xmath114 is chosen so that @xmath115 . it can then be checked that @xmath114 is uniformly bounded away from 0 and infinity and converges to a constant as @xmath95 tends to infinity .",
    "we comment briefly on the choice of @xmath94 . in some sense ,",
    "the natural choice a priori is to take @xmath94 to be the square of the first dirichlet eigenfunction on @xmath99 , normalised to have unit mass .",
    "this is for instance what is used in bolthausen s work @xcite with some additional tweaking near the boundary of the shape ( see the definition of @xmath116 on p.893 of @xcite ) . here",
    "our choice means that the slope is much steeper near the boundary .",
    "the linear growth of @xmath94 near the boundary is in fact the crucial feature of this choice .",
    "note that , under @xmath89 , the jump chain of @xmath117 is a discrete markov chain , with transition probabilities @xmath118 indeed , even on the main diagonals of the cube , the number of edges going to @xmath119 is equal to the number of edges going to @xmath120 . note that @xmath121 is a reversible measure for @xmath122 .",
    "our first goal is to prove a crude bound on the mixing time of @xmath123 we do this by estimating the spectral gap of the markov chain , using the method of _ canonical paths _ of diaconis and saloff - coste .",

    "when @xmath5 , this is essentially equivalent to a self - avoiding loop .",
    "let @xmath634 denote the number of self - avoiding surfaces with @xmath286 plaquettes , and let @xmath635 note that when @xmath128 , the limsup is a limit and is ( by definition ) equal to the connective constant of @xmath76 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath636 in general , which is all we will use .    to each finite @xmath38",

    "it is interesting to note that the lower bound on @xmath55 is valid for all @xmath3 ( i.e. , does not assume @xmath656 ) .",
    "we now discuss several open problems .",
    "the most basic ones is to ask whether the constants @xmath49 and @xmath50 appearing in theorem [ t:2dimgibbs ] really need to be different from one another , and if indeed @xmath657 is the right order of magnitude in all dimensions @xmath6 .",
    "the reason for looking for sets of the form @xmath663 to approximate the normalised range of the walk , is that we believe that with this formulation @xmath99 can be chosen to be nonrandom : that is , a certain random translation of the deterministic shape @xmath99 gives a good approximation of the normalised range .",
    "once the existence of @xmath99 is established one may ask numerous questions about its geometry . for instance , does it have any flat facet ?",
    "we conjecture in fact that as @xmath664 , @xmath665 converges in the hausdorff sense to a diamond of unit diameter .",
    "indeed it is easy to see that the diamond is the minimiser of the isoperimetric problem for the vertex - boundary : i.e. , if @xmath666 , then @xmath667 is attained for a diamond @xmath668 , whenever @xmath669 .",
    "it is interesting to compare this situation for the case of a random walk conditioned on @xmath670 .",
    "there again , we believe a similar shape theorem holds , but the limiting shape of @xmath671 as @xmath664 should instead be a square with unit diameter .",
    "this is because , in fact shows that @xmath672 \\leq \\exp ( - \\beta | { \\partial}_e g | ) \\ ] ] where @xmath673 denotes the edge boundary of a graph @xmath28 .",
    "when @xmath674 , it is reasonable to guess that @xmath665 should minimise its edge boundary , rather than its vertex boundary , and hence be a square rather than a diamond .",
    "typical fluctuations of the shape ( in the case where @xmath656 say ) raise intriguing questions . in the percolation construction of the wulff crystal",
    "when @xmath2 is large but finite , these fluctuations are known with considerable precision .",
    "for instance , the so - called maximal local roughness , which measures the maximal distance from a point on the boundary of the shape to the polygonal hull of that shape , is of order @xmath675 if the diameter of the wulff shape is of order @xmath286 : see @xcite , @xcite ; more recently an extremely precise result in this direction was recently established by hammond @xcite .",
    "these exponents are identical to those arising in the kardar ",
    "zhang ( kpz ) universality class .",
    "while the wulff crystal is not believed to belong to this universality class , there is nevertheless an analogy between the two situations , a fact which guides the intuition in the approach of @xcite .",
    "we speculate that in two dimensions , the exponent for the fluctuations take the value in agreement with the wulff crystal ( and hence also with kpz ) : this suggests that the maximum facet length is of order @xmath676 and the maximum local roughness of order @xmath677 .",
