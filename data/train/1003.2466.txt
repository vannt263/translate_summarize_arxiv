    "the dc superconducting quantum interference device ( squid)a superconducting loop interrupted by two josephson junctions  is an extremely sensitive detector of magnetic flux , and has been used in a wide variety of applications for almost half a century @xcite .",
    "recent progress in nanoscale magnets @xcite has generated excitement about using magnetic molecules for both classical and quantum information storage and processing @xcite . in principle , a squid has sufficiently high intrinsic flux sensitivity and bandwidth to resolve the spin state of a single magnetic molecule .",
    "however , a conventional dc squid with resistively shunted josephson tunnel junctions is operated with a current bias just above its critical current , and the continuous dissipation in the shunt resistors produces local heating and a backaction that can potentially induce relaxation and decoherence in a nanoscale magnet .",
    "this dissipation can be eliminated by using an unshunted squid and applying fast current pulses to measure its critical current @xcite . however , the flux sensitivity is significantly lower than in the resistively shunted case @xcite because the repetition rate  and hence the bandwidth  are limited by the time ( @xmath21 ms for aluminum tunnel junctions at millikelvin temperatures ) required for the squid to cool to its equilibrium temperature after returning to the zero - voltage state @xcite .",
    "any backaction associated with switching to the voltage state remains .",
    "alternatively , the squid can be operated in the superconducting regime where it functions as a flux dependent nonlinear inductor , and forms a nonlinear resonator when shunted with a capacitor [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] . in our device",
    ", we apply a fixed frequency microwave drive to this resonator and demodulate the reflected microwave signal . an input flux signal results in a variation of the resonance frequency and a corresponding phase modulation of the microwave drive tone . at specific bias points in the presence of a sufficiently intense drive tone , parametric",
    "amplification occurs and the flux sensitivity is enhanced .",
    "dispersive squid techniques have been studied in a variety of different microwave circuit configurations over the past thirty years @xcite .",
    "recent work on the dispersive readout of superconducting qubits  single , pseudospin-1/2 systems  also harnesses the nonlinearity of the josephson junction to boost sensitivity , but typically these devices are operated in the bistable regime as digital detectors @xcite . in this article , we demonstrate an analog magnetometer with megahertz bandwidth suitable for measuring transitions between states in multilevel spin systems @xcite and the macroscopic magnetization of spin ensembles @xcite . depending on the operating conditions ,",
    "the performance ranges from an effective flux noise of 0.14 * * @xmath0hz@xmath1 and 0.6 mhz of signal bandwidth to a noise of 0.29 @xmath0hz@xmath1 and a bandwidth of 20 mhz .",
    "this performance results from the large gain , bandwidth and nearly quantum limited noise temperature of the parametric amplifier which by itself is suitable for a variety of dispersive measurements as a general purpose amplifier .",
    "these results are in quantitative agreement with our theoretical model which , in particular , predicts that low flux noise and wide bandwidth are obtained for a low q ( quality factor ) resonator .",
    "our theory allows us to optimize our device for specific applications , and provides insight into the fundamental and practical limitations of a single squid operated in the dispersive regime .",
    "we model our magnetometer as consisting of two stages : a transducer which upconverts a low frequency magnetic flux signal to a microwave voltage signal and a subsequent parametric gain stage [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) ] . using this picture",
    ", we derive an expression for the flux sensitivity based on the circuit parameters and the parametric gain .",
    "we first consider the dynamics of the josephson oscillator .",
    "the supercurrent @xmath3 flowing through a josephson tunnel junction is related to the phase difference @xmath4 across it by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the critical current .  for a squid with loop inductance @xmath7 ,",
    "the  critical current is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the flux through the squid  loop and @xmath10 is the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "thus , we treat the squid  as a junction with a flux dependent critical current . in our experiment the squid  is shunted with a lumped - element capacitor , forming an electrical resonator with resonant frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the resonator is connected directly to a microwave transmission line of characteristic impedance @xmath12 [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] , resulting in a quality factor @xmath13 .",
    "the dynamics of this system are well described by the duffing equation , in which the sinusoidal current phase relationship of the junction is truncated after the first nonlinear term @xcite : @xmath14 here , @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the amplitude of the rf drive at frequency @xmath17 .",
    "next we consider a flux @xmath18 applied to the squid , where @xmath19 is a static flux bias and @xmath20 @xmath21 is the amplitude of a weak flux signal at frequency @xmath22 .",
    "we calculate the system response by assuming a solution of the form @xmath23 , where the first term is the steady state solution for @xmath24 and @xmath25 is a small perturbation of the junction phase due to @xmath26 , and substituting it into eq .",
    "( [ eqn_duffing ] ) .",
    "the resulting expression for the junction phase perturbation @xmath25 is @xmath27 \\label{eqn_paramp}\\\\ &   = \\frac{\\delta\\phi}{z_{0}c\\phi_{0}}\\frac{\\partial v_{rf}}{\\partial\\phi } \\left [   \\cos(\\omega_{d}t+\\omega_{s}t-\\theta)+\\cos(\\omega_{d}t-\\omega _ { s}t-\\theta)\\right ]   .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we recognize the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn_paramp ] ) as the equation for a parametrically driven harmonic oscillator . for appropriate bias conditions ,",
    "the system can amplify @xcite any additional weak rf  signal with frequency @xmath28 near @xmath17 .  in this doubly degenerate mode of parametric amplification @xcite ,",
    "a single sideband signal at frequency @xmath29 is amplified with a voltage gain @xmath30 , and an idler signal is also produced at frequency @xmath31 with gain @xmath32 and phase factor @xmath33 [ fig .",
    "2(a ) ] . in the high gain limit",
    ", the voltage signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is degraded by a factor of at least @xmath34 , since the amplified signal is accompanied by incoherent noise from both the signal and idler frequencies .  for an operating temperature @xmath35",
    ", this noise is set by the amplitude of quantum fluctuations at frequency @xmath36 and the amplifier is quantum limited with a noise temperature @xmath37 .",
    "other josephson junction based parametric amplifiers have been shown to operate with near quantum limited noise temperature @xcite .",
    "if such an amplifier is now presented with a double sideband signal , symmetric about the drive tone with coherent components at both the signal and idler frequencies , the output voltage is a coherent combination of these two signals .",
    "we can express this double sideband signal in terms of two orthogonal quadrature signals ",
    "one of which is amplified and the other deamplified .",
    "this process is shown schematically for the amplified quadrature in fig .",
    "if the signal lies fully along the amplified quadrature ( @xmath38 ) , it is amplified without adding additional noise , a process known as phase sensitive amplification @xcite .",
    "examining the right hand side of eq.([eqn_paramp ] ) , we see that the flux signal at frequency @xmath39 has been parametrically upconverted through interaction with the drive tone , resulting in a double sideband rf signal with components at frequencies @xmath40 which can be expresssed as a single quadrature signal with angle @xmath41 relative to the drive tone",
    ".  the amplitude of these two signals can be computed using the transduction coefficient @xmath42    in the limit of low drive current @xmath16 , @xmath43 and the paired rf signals serve to modulate the phase of the reflected microwave drive signal at frequency @xmath39 .  in the high gain limit",
    ", the component of the transduced signal which lies along the amplified quadrature of the phase sensitive amplifier is noiselessly amplified with gain @xmath44 .",
    "the transduced signal , however , does not lie fully along the amplified quadrature at high gain points , so that the effective transduction coefficient is reduced .",
    "consequently , in the high gain limit , the amplitude of the output signal is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",
    "to characterize the flux sensitivity of the magnetometer , we first note that the output of our device is further amplified by a cryogenic high electron mobility transistor ( hemt ) amplifier and a room temperature amplifier before being mixed down and digitized for further processing .",
    "the noise of this amplification chain is given by the system noise temperature @xmath47 , and includes cable losses between our device and the hemt .",
    "we now refer the noise of the output rf voltage signal to an effective input flux noise via the transduction coefficient @xmath48 @xmath49 .",
    "this effective flux noise has a single - sided spectral density @xmath50     note that in the above expression @xmath47 refers to the added noise of the amplification chain and the total noise includes a contribution from zero point fluctuations given by @xmath51 . for weak drive amplitudes , where the resonator response is linear and @xmath52 , @xmath47",
    "is dominated by @xmath53 , the noise temperature of the hemt amplifier and is typically much larger than the quantum limit .",
    "furthermore , we can express the junction oscillation amplitude in terms of the voltage drive as @xmath54 @xmath55 .  in the absence of parametric amplification",
    ", there is no preferred quadrature for amplification and we set @xmath56  to yield @xmath57 which varies inversely with resonator @xmath58 and drive voltage @xmath59 .",
    "thus , in this regime higher sensitivity can be achieved by increasing the @xmath58 of the resonator and the drive amplitude .  in practice , however , the maximum drive voltage is limited by the onset of nonlinearity inherent in any squid  based resonator @xcite .     for strong drive amplitudes , where the resonator response is nonlinear and @xmath60 such that @xmath61 , the noise temperature of the system is determined by the amplitude of quantum fluctuations at the drive frequency , and @xmath62 .",
    "further , as @xmath63 , @xmath64 approaches a critical value@xcite of @xmath65 .  for @xmath66 , @xmath67 @xmath68 and",
    "we can make the approximation @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , at this operating point , the angle @xmath70 also approaches a critical value of 60@xmath71 , so that we can approximate @xmath72 . since the maximum value of @xmath48 is 2 , only half of the transduced signal",
    "is noiselessly amplified resulting in an effective flux noise two times higher than what could be achieved in the ideal case with @xmath73 . a similar analysis which treats the system",
    "as a degenerate parametric amplifier with a detuned pump and takes into account the non - orthogonality of the amplified and deamplified quadratures , gives the same result in this limiting case @xcite .",
    "the effective flux noise computes to @xmath74    this expression has the remarkable feature that the effective flux noise varies directly with the resonator @xmath58 , so that a resonator with lower @xmath58 has improved flux sensitivity .",
    "this results from the requirements of parametric amplification , in particular that high parametric gain occurs at a critical phase oscillation @xmath75 , which in turn limits the maximum achievable transduction coefficient .",
    "additionally , lowering the resonator @xmath58 leads to parametric amplification with increased bandwidth for a given parametric gain , and so is doubly desirable .  in both the linear and nonlinear regime ,",
    "it is advantageous to increase the squid critical current and operate at a flux bias near @xmath76 however , for sufficiently large critical current such that @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the inductance of the squid loop , the simple expression for @xmath79 is no longer valid and one has to use numerical simulations to determine the change in squid inductance as a function of applied flux , which is often a multivalued function .",
    "furthermore , unlike the critical current of a dc squid , the inductance modulation with flux of a dispersive squid is not limited by the loop inductance provided one remains in one of the branches of the multivalued function .",
    "our lumped element resonator is shown in a false color scanning electron microscope image in fig .",
    "the device consists of three layers : a 250-nm thick nb underlayer , a 180-nm thick sin@xmath80 insulating layer , and an aluminum upper layer .",
    "the capacitor was fabricated in a split geometry , with both electrodes on the top al layer connected through the nb underlayer .",
    "the split geometry simplifies fabrication by avoiding the use of vias .",
    "the squid was fabricated with double - angle evaporated al - alo@xmath80-al junctions , with @xmath81 @xmath82a .",
    "a short - circuit terminated coplanar waveguide transmission line was also fabricated on chip to allow us to apply oscillating flux signals  to the squid  loop .",
    "static flux was provided by a superconducting wire - wound coil .",
    "the device was cooled in superconducting and cryoperm shields , and its performance measured at 30 mk in a cryogen - free dilution refrigerator .  all static and rf lines were heavily attenuated and filtered to minimize external noise",
    ".     to determine the dependence of the resonant frequency on applied flux , we used a vector network analyzer to measure the phase of a weak microwave tone reflected from the resonator as a function of frequency and flux .  the results are shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) .  as the flux through the squid  washer was varied , the resonant frequency varied from a maximum of 7.2 ghz to a minimum of 4 ghz , set by the low frequency cutoff of the circulators used in the measurement chain .",
    "the horizontal bands apparent in the plot are due to the finite directivity of the circulator used to separate the incoming and outgoing microwave signals from the resonator .",
    "the sample was flux biased at @xmath83 , where the flux sensitivity was high and the frequency band was clear of ripples which could obscure the response to rf and magnetic signals .",
    "we next examined the performance of the parametric amplification stage .  to characterize the gain ,",
    "a strong rf drive tone at frequency @xmath17 was applied to the resonator simultaneously with a weak rf signal at frequency @xmath28 [ fig .",
    "2(a ) ] .",
    "the reflected rf signal was further amplified , demodulated by a double sideband mixer with local oscillator frequency @xmath84 hz , and digitized .",
    "the gain was determined by calculating the ratio of the reflected microwave signal with the drive tone turned on versus a calibration sweep with the drive tone turned off ; in the latter mode the signal tone is reflected from the resonator with unity gain .  the gain is plotted in fig .",
    "4(a ) as a function of the frequency offset @xmath85 for different drive powers .",
    "the advantage of low resonator q is evident in these data where a gain of 15 db is demonstrated with a -3 db full - bandwidth of 40 mhz .",
    "we note that the observed gain and bandwidth deviate slightly from the analytical solution of the simple duffing oscillator prediction for a given drive amplitude .",
    "this discrepancy is resolved using numerical simulations which indicate gain suppression due to noise rounding in nonlinear resonators with very low q.    in separate measurements using a hot / cold load , we found the system noise temperature at the plane of the resonator to be between 29 and 37.5 @xmath86 , with the scatter arising from the uncertainty in the attenuation of the hot load line . by measuring the snr  improvement of rf signals measured at finite gain versus @xmath87 db",
    ", we calculate the system noise temperature as a function of drive power [ shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) ] .",
    "the lowest system noise temperature was measured with @xmath88 db at @xmath89 , with @xmath47 between @xmath90 and @xmath91 , corresponding to a nearly quantum limited added noise of 0.50 to 0.78 photons . at the highest gain point ,",
    "the noise temperature was degraded due to instabilities associated with operation near the critical point @xcite .",
    "we subsequently investigated the flux response of the system by applying a flux tone at frequency @xmath39 , chosen so that the upper sideband of the upconverted rf output at frequency @xmath92 was offset by 10 hz from an additional applied rf signal at frequency @xmath28 .",
    "this allows simultaneous measurements of the parametric gain and flux sensitivity .",
    "the output signals were again amplified , demodulated with a double sideband mixer with local oscillator frequency @xmath84 hz , and digitized .",
    "the snr of the flux response at each bias point was calculated by comparing the height of the transduced output signal to the average of the white noise in a bandwidth of 200 hz .",
    "this snr was converted into an effective flux noise using the known amplitude of the flux signal applied to the magnetometer .  in these measurements ,",
    "the primary source of uncertainty in the effective flux noise is the calibration of the flux signal , which we estimate to be a few percent .  in fig .",
    "4(c ) , we plot the effective flux noise as a function of drive amplitude and flux signal frequency .  in the linear regime , the magnetometer bandwidth",
    "is limited by the bandwidth of our flux excitation line and is demonstrated to be at least 80 mhz . using our value of @xmath93",
    ", we expect the bandwidth to be greater than 100 mhz . by biasing the resonator in the nonlinear regime , we trade bandwidth for parametric gain and reduced noise . by operating at a parametric gain of 32 db , we achieved a minimum effective flux noise of 0.21 @xmath0hz@xmath1 at @xmath94 khz .",
    "however , this is not the lowest attainable noise as the demodulated noise in these measurements with @xmath95  is the sum of incoherent noise sidebands above and below the lo frequency , thus degrading the effective flux noise .    to determine the optimum device performance",
    ", we performed a second set of measurements with @xmath96 @xmath36 .  with this demodulation technique we made use of the single quadrature nature of the transduced flux signal .",
    "the effective flux noise as function of drive power measured at @xmath97100 @xmath98 for both demodulation techniques is shown in fig .",
    "4(c ) and clearly demonstrates the advantage of demodulating with @xmath96 @xmath36 . in the linear regime at low powers ,",
    "the latter  demodulation scheme improves the effective flux noise by a factor of 2 since both sidebands containing information are used .  at high drive powers",
    "the improvement is only @xmath34 , since both sidebands contain identical signal and noise due to parametric amplification .",
    "the minimum effective flux noise of 0.14 @xmath0hz@xmath1 was achieved with @xmath88 db , with a flux signal bandwidth of 600 khz set by the parametric amplifier half bandwidth .",
    "if we substitute our system parameters into eq.([eqn_fluxnoise_nl ] ) , we predict a minimum effective flux noise of 0.14 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath0hz@xmath1 , in very good quantitative agreement with our measured results .",
    "the uncertainty in this calculation is the estimated uncertainty in our knowledge of the circuit parameters .  as a final note ,",
    "we observe that , by reducing the parametric gain to 15 db , we achieved an effective flux noise of 0.29 @xmath0hz@xmath1 while signficantly increasing the flux signal bandwidth to 20 mhz .",
    "we have demonstrated a dispersive magnetometer based on a lumped - element , nonlinear resonator involving a two - junction squid . the bandwidth and sensitivity of the device",
    "can be dynamically altered to suit the needs of specific measurements by changing the microwave drive .",
    "we have achieved an effective flux noise of 0.14 @xmath0hz@xmath1 with a bandwidth of 600 khz .",
    "the bandwidth can be increased to 20 mhz with only a factor of two increase in flux noise .",
    "we expect that our magnetometer will exhibit low backaction , since the squid never switches to the voltage state , making it attractive for quantum state measurement .",
    "there are several avenues for further improvement .",
    "the magnetometer could be realized as two physically separate devices , a transducer and a gain stage .",
    "this would allow for independent optimization of the transduction coefficient and the performance of the parametric amplifier . by increasing the q of the transduction stage to match the bandwidth of the parametric amplifier , and rotating the transduced signal fully into the amplified quadrature , reductions by a factor of about 10 in the effective flux noise should be possible . a lower effective flux noise",
    "could also be achieved by optimizing the transduction coefficient using junctions with higher critical currents , and by operating at a flux bias closer to @xmath21/2 .",
    "an increased bandwidth could be obtained by reducing the noise temperature of the microwave postamplifier , thus reducing the parametric gain necessary for quantum noise limited operation . moreover ,",
    "the quantum noise limited amplification we have observed suggests that this device can be used as a general purpose first - stage rf amplifier for a variety of applications .",
    "an attractive possibility is to replace the tunnel junctions in the squid with nanobridges , provided they have sufficient nonlinearity to exhibit efficient flux tranduction and high parametric gain@xcite .",
    "nanobridge squids have the advantage of efficient coupling to nanoscale spin systems , such as single molecule magnets@xcite , and resilience to applied longitudinal magnetic field .",
