    "as our calculations above have shown , it is very difficult to estimate the precise gas masses for sfrgs due to various uncertainties .",
    "however , a potentially important result emerges from these co observations : compared to smgs , sfrgs appear to be significantly more efficient at producing stars from a given molecular gas mass .",
    "if this is strictly true , then sfrgs can not be interpreted as _ scaled up _",
    "versions of local ulirgs as tacconi et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2008 ) have argued is the case for smgs , since their gas masses appear to be lower than expected for their radio luminosities .",
    "there are two considerations to be taken into account here .",
    "firstly , the far - ir luminosities and thus sfrs may be over - estimated from the radio , for instance if buried agn were present .",
    "while none of these sources have agn signatures in their uv or optical spectra , a deeply obscured agn could still be driving a significant portion of the radio luminosity ( e.g. , daddi et al .",
    "2007b ; casey et al .",
    "a further possible complication comes again from the radio selection of these objects .",
    "there is a @xmath110.25  dex scatter in the radio - fir relation ( yun et al .",
    "2001 ) , and while locally there is no apparent correlation between sed shape and radio - fir scaling , it is possible in our sfrgs that we are selecting galaxies which are amongst the lower 0.25  dex ( weaker fir per unit radio ) .",
    "if the sfrs in our galaxies were several times lower then the efficiencies would be similar to the average smg ( fig .",
    "secondly , the conversion from co(32 ) to molecular gas mass may not be the same as for smgs . if @xmath205 were greater than the @xmath111 estimated for local ulirgs ( and as inferred to be correct for smgs ) , these sfrgs could make up the shortfall in molecular gas mass from the average smg ( @xmath206 ) , although the conversion would have to approach that typically adopted for the milky way @xmath207 ( solomon & van den bout 2005 ) .",
    "this is unlikely given that the sfrgs often show clear evidence in high - resolution radio observations for merger - driven starbursts ( casey et al .",
    "2008b ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that while our observations have highlighted an ultraluminous @xmath1 population which may build stars in an extremely efficient mode ( or at least as efficient as smgs if their sfrs are overestimated by factors of several ) , recent observations ( daddi et al .  2008 ) have identified a population of @xmath208 galaxies which they detect in co(21 ) exhibiting the opposite property : low - efficiency star formation .",
    "these daddi et al .",
    "galaxies are selected as large massive disk - like galaxies , and it is perhaps not surprising that they form stars in an apparently quiescent `` spiral - galaxy '' mode .",
    "nonetheless , it is intriguing that galaxies in the high - redshift universe have been discovered with such a wide range of star - forming efficiencies ( from poor to extreme ) all lying in the 10@xmath209-l@xmath3 regime .",
    "massive galaxies are being built in a variety of modes in the @xmath210 peak star - formation period .",
    "the short depletion times compared to the long times to form the stellar masses suggests we may be seeing sfrgs in the last phase of their current star - formation episodes .",
    "however , one would expect on average to find sfrgs as a population half - way through their gas consumption lifetimes . in this context ,",
    "the small ages imply either a very high duty cycle or that the sfrs are over - estimated from the radio luminosity .",
    "we reiterate that the large fir luminosity estimates for our sfrgs are based mainly on the radio / fir relation which is apparently applies for smgs ( kovacs et al .",
    "2006 ) , but is only marginally supported for sfrgs through the 24-@xmath0 m luminosity and dust - corrected h@xmath39 measurements .",
    "it is possible that we are over - estimating their star - formation activity , which would lead us to under - estimate the duration timescales above .",
    "we also note that the observed co may be closely associated with the star formation , and thus is probably warm and highly visible ( i.e. with low @xmath74 )",
    ". it does not rule out the existence of a cooler less visible component ( with high @xmath74 ) , not intimately associated with the current zone of star formation ( e.g.  in the inner disk ) , which may still become available within its own dynamical timescale to fuel star formation .",
    "the result above may therefore be affected by the selection for the highly visible component of the molecular gas .",
    "however , the cold gas would need to be fairly widely distributed ( to ensure that it does nt violate the dynamical limits on the total gas+stellar mass in the central regions ) , yet it must also be able to flow into the central regions on a timescale of @xmath145100  myrs ( near the limit of the gas sound speed @xmath211  km / s ) . in order to evaluate the implications of these results for massive galaxy formation , we recall that these three galaxies have typical characteristics for the sfrg population at all wavelengths measured .",
    "our results underline the major role of gas consumption over short timescales and with high efficiencies , characterizing rapid and strong merger - driven bursts as a major growth mode for both stellar mass and black holes in the distant universe .",
    "even if the sfrs in these sfrgs were over - estimated by a factor of a few , they would remain ulirg - class galaxies .",
    "if we assume that @xmath1150% of the submm - faint sfrgs at @xmath1 are dominated by star formation at levels comparable to smgs , we arrive at a density of @xmath212mpc@xmath19 , similar to that observed for smgs ( chapman et al .",
    "together , the smgs and sfrgs represent a volume density @xmath213 smaller than measured for galaxies inferred to be forming stars at low efficiencies by daddi et al .",
    "( 2007b ) which have space densities of order of @xmath214mpc@xmath19 . with sfrs a few to 10@xmath7 larger in the smgs and sfrgs ,",
    "the net effect is roughly equal numbers of stars being formed in both high- and low - efficiency modes at @xmath1 .",
    "further study should ascertain whether other sfrgs follow a similar pattern to the galaxies studied in this paper .",
    "a substantial sample will allow the properties of the gas to dynamical mass ratio to be determined accurately for the population , since we only currently have one well - detected line profile , and the dynamical mass determination is limited by the unknown inclination .",
    "@xmath215 we conclude that the radio luminosities of these sfrgs are higher for their overall mass ( gas plus stellar ) than for the smgs ( given that if the radio - sfrs are over - estimated for one class , they could well be for both ) .",
    "@xmath215 we note that smgs in general , and also these sfrgs , are outliers of the stellar mass - sfr correlation ( daddi et al .",
    "2007a ) , probably due to the higher efficiency in forming stars for a similar stellar mass and co luminosity .",
    "lower gas masses in the sfrgs would imply even higher sfes than the smgs .",
    "by contrast , if the sfrs are significantly over - estimated by the radio , or the co - to - h@xmath69 conversion were significantly different from smgs , then sfrgs could have similar efficiencies to typical ulirgs . together with the apparent low - efficiency star - forming ( u)lirgs from daddi et al .

    "<S> high - redshift , dust - obscured galaxies  selected to be luminous in the radio but relatively faint at 850@xmath0 m  appear to represent a different population from the ultra - luminous submillimeter- ( submm- ) bright population . </S>",
    "<S> they may be star - forming galaxies with hotter dust temperatures or they may have lower far - infrared luminosities and larger contributions from obscured active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we present observations of three @xmath1 examples of this population , which we term _ submm - faint radio galaxies  sfrgs _ in co(32 ) using the iram plateau de bure interferometer to study their gas and dynamical properties . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the molecular gas mass in each of the three sfrgs ( @xmath2m@xmath3 , @xmath4m@xmath3 and @xmath5m@xmath3 , respectively ) and , in the case of rgj163655 , a dynamical mass by measurement of the width of the co(32 ) line ( @xmath6m@xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> while these gas masses are substantial , on average they are 4@xmath7 lower than submm - selected galaxies ( smgs ) </S>",
    "<S> . radio - inferred star formation rates ( @xmath8m@xmath9yr@xmath10 ) suggest much higher star - formation efficiencies than are found for smgs , and shorter gas depletion time scales ( @xmath1111myr ) , much shorter than the time required to form their current stellar masses ( @xmath11160myr ; @xmath1110@xmath12m@xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , sfrs may be overestimated by factors of a few , bringing the efficiencies in line with those typically measured for other ultraluminous star - forming galaxies and suggesting sfrgs are more like ultraviolet- ( uv-)selected star - forming galaxies with enhanced radio emission . </S>",
    "<S> a tentative detection of rgj163655at 350@xmath0 m suggests hotter dust temperatures  and thus similar gas - to - dust mass fractions  as the smgs . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that sfrgs radio luminosities are larger than would naturally scale from local ulirgs given their gas masses or gas fractions . </S>"
