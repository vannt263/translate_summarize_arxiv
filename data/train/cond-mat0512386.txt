    "the direct treatment of fluids adsorbed random pore structures has been achieved within the framework of lattice fluids yielding significant new insight into adsorption phenomena @xcite .",
    "an alternative way of modelling porous structures is to consider pore structures generated by quenched configurations of model fluids .",
    "these configurations carry a statistical weight that is determined solely by the hamiltonian of the ( pure ) model fluid .",
    "the adsorbate fluid is then brought into contact with the quenched particles ( referred to as the matrix ) , and is `` annealed '' in the sense that it is under the influence of the matrix as an external potential .",
    "in addition to the ensemble average , an average over all realisations of the matrix must be carried out .",

    ", we would expect the fluid phase diagram in the @xmath97 plane to depend explicitly on the matrix density @xmath139 .",
    "however , bearing in mind the accuracy of ( [ eq : f_ex ] ) at high fluid densities @xcite , we expect only a weak dependence on @xmath139 in the true phase diagram of the binary gcm immersed in a gcm matrix .    in earlier work @xcite , we found that due to the soft  core nature of the particles , condensation of the coexisting phase occurs both on the surface and _ inside _ a single big particle .",
    "making connection with this work , we found that for matrices composed of big gcm particles with density @xmath176 ( i.e.  densities near the overlap concentration ) , the mechanism for capillary condensation of the coexisting fluid phase in the matrix is the joining of the thick films of the coexisting phase that form around individual big gcm particles as bulk coexistence is approached @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is somewhat different from what occurs in hard core systems , where the wetting films grow on the surface of big matrix particles and condensation occurs throughout the matrix by the joining of these surface films .",
    "much of the simplicity inherent in the present theory stems from the fact that the effect of the matrix on the fluid can be described in terms of a shift in the effective chemical potential [ c.f .",
    "( [ eq : mu_eff ] ) ] and an effective one body external potential  see eq.([eq : v_eff ] ) .",
    "note that this simplification is not clear at the outset : a particular configuration of matrix particles can , of course , be treated as an external potential for the adsorbed fluid , but having averaged over the ensemble of possible matrix configurations , the description of the matrix then enters on the level of the ( ensemble average ) one body density profile of the matrix particles . that this problem can be subsequently mapped to an effective one body potential , which is much simpler to treat than the potential exerted by a particular configuration of matrix particles ,",
    "makes determining properties of the inhomogeneous fluid in contact with an inhomogeneous matrix tractable .",
    "following this procedure we were able to calculate adsorption and wetting behaviour of the binary mixture on the surface of the matrix in contact with a reservoir of the fluid .",
    "in the case of a reservoir at state points near to coexistence , we found a rich interplay between the fluid condensation in the bulk of the matrix and wetting behaviour at the interface .",
    "we conclude that the present dft approach constitutes a powerful approach for treating fluids in inhomogeneous random media .",
