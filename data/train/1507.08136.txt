    "the maser ( microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation ) was conceived based on thermodynamic considerations  @xcite . in its micromaser implementation , coherent radiation is generated by inverted two - level ( rydberg ) atoms that are randomly injected into a microwave cavity one by one  @xcite . for years",
    ", the focus of micromaser studies had been on its quantum - electrodynamics features  @xcite , including its extensions to the cooperative regime of multiatom clusters that are simultaneously present in the cavity  @xcite , until scully et al .",
    "@xcite revived the interest in the thermodynamics of such devices .",
    "they treated the atomic beam as a thermodynamic resource , since randomly injected atoms , which are discarded ( traced out ) after they exit the cavity , constitute an effective reservoir ( bath ) for the cavity field mode ( in the markovian approximation ) .",
    "the surprising finding of scully et al .",
    "@xcite was that a beam of three - level atoms with coherence between two of its levels may be viewed as a nonthermal , quantum - coherent ( `` phaseonium '' ) bath that , given an appropriate phase @xmath0 of the interlevel coherence , can thermalize the cavity field to a temperature @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the atoms temperature without coherence .",
    "the dramatic consequence of the higher temperature attainable by the cavity field owing to the phaseonium coherence is a transgression of the nominal carnot efficiency bound in a heat engine , with the cavity field in the role of a working fluid ( wf ) : if the wf undergoes a cycle where it is coupled to the phaseonium bath in one stroke and to a cold bath at temperature @xmath3 in another , then the efficiency bound of the engine satisfies @xmath4 , instead of @xmath5 .",
    "this landmark proposal has triggered a variety of proposals for engine schemes based on nonthermal baths that are capable of `` super - carnot '' operation  @xcite , among them engines fuelled by a squeezed nonthermal bath  @xcite .    some of us have recently asserted  @xcite that machines fuelled by nonthermal baths may be divided into two categories according to their operation paradigm :    * _ machines of the first kind _ are those fuelled by a nonthermal bath , such as a squeezed - thermal or coherently - displaced thermal bath , that render the wf steady - state _ nonpassive _  @xcite .",
    "such baths change the machine into a _",
    "thermo - mechanical engine _ that , unlike a heat engine , is fuelled by both mechanical work and heat imparted by the bath to the wf",
    ". the carnot bound may be transgressed in such machines at the expense of work supplied by the bath .",
    "however , their efficiency bound can not be properly compared with the carnot bound , since the latter is a restriction imposed by the second law on heat  @xcite but not on work imparted by the bath . *",
    "_ machines of the second kind _ are those where the wf is thermalized by the nonthermal bath , as is the case of an engine fuelled by a phaseonium bath .",
    "such a machine is a proper _ heat engine _ but the ability of the phaseonium bath to thermalize the wf to a temperature @xmath1 elevates its carnot bound above that associated with an incoherent bath at temperature @xmath2 .    intriguingly , in micromaser setups , a beam of multiatom clusters has been shown to thermalize the cavity - field wf in some cases  @xcite , but also coherently displace  @xcite or squeeze it  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the wf may receive both work ( and thus become nonpassive ) and heat from the bath",
    ". the cavity field may thus be the key ingredient in machines of the two kinds surveyed above . however , the criteria whereby atoms in a micromaser can fuel machines of either the first or the second kind are generally unknown , notwithstanding several recent results obtained along this line  @xcite .    here",
    "we pose the question : to what extent is the quantum state preparation of multiatom clusters ( before they are injected into the cavity ) instrumental for determining not only the kind of machine we may operate but also the quantitative bounds of its performance ? figuratively speaking ,",
    "if the multiatom cluster is the `` crude oil '' , the question is : which preparation of the cluster is the refining process that can deliver a `` gasoline '' with a `` specific octane '' ?    to answer this question , we first derive ( in sec .  [ sec : model ] ) a master equation that governs the cavity field under the standard assumption of a short interaction of each atom with the cavity field , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the atom  field coupling strength and @xmath8 is the interaction time . in this regime , the steady - state density matrix of the cavity field may only be a gaussian state : thermal , coherently - displaced or squeezed  @xcite .",
    "this restriction is shown to imply ( sec .",
    "[ sec : classification ] ) that two- or three - atom clusters suffice for the preparation of all gaussian states of the field , thus making larger clusters qualitatively redundant .",
    "[ sec_squeezing ] and  [ sec : results ] are devoted , respectively , to the classification of coherences or quantum correlations among the atoms that may be associated with ( i ) fuel for machines of the first kind that correspond to states whose coherences displace or squeeze the cavity field , as well as cause its heating ; and ( ii ) fuel for machines of the second kind which is purely `` combustible '' , i.e. , corresponds to atomic states that only allow for heat and entropy exchange with the field . in both sec .  [ sec_squeezing ] and  [ sec : results ] we identify highly promising multiatom states for each kind of fuel and infer the best parameters relevant to the machine operation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we discuss the results and propose viable experimental protocols for their implementation .",
    "we consider a micromaser - type setup wherein the cavity - field mode is the working fluid ( wf ) that is energized ( fuelled ) by a beam of two - level atoms which are injected into the cavity at random , poisson - distributed , times  @xcite . by contrast to the standard micromaser scenario  @xcite , the atomic beam is here assumed to be composed of @xmath9-atom clusters that are prepared in a controlled quantum - correlated ( entangled ) state prior to their injection into the cavity , where they interact with the cavity field simultaneously ( see fig .",

    "<S> in this paper we address the question : to what extent is the quantum state preparation of multiatom clusters ( before they are injected into the microwave cavity ) instrumental for determining not only the kind of machine we may operate but also the quantitative bounds of its performance ? figuratively speaking , if the multiatom cluster is the `` crude oil '' , the question is : which preparation of the cluster is the refining process that can deliver a `` gasoline '' with a `` specific octane '' ? </S>",
    "<S> we classify coherences or quantum correlations among the atoms according to their ability to serve as ( i ) fuel for nonthermal machines corresponding to atomic states whose coherences displace or squeeze the cavity field , as well as cause its heating ; and ( ii ) fuel which is purely `` combustible '' , i.e. , corresponds to atomic states that only allow for heat and entropy exchange with the field and can energize a proper heat engine . </S>",
    "<S> we identify highly promising multiatom states for each kind of fuel and propose viable experimental schemes for their implementation . </S>"
