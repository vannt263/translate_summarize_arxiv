    "similarly , given that we know the action of the generators on the elements of @xmath76 , we can compute @xmath67 for all @xmath68 .",
    "we prove the last claim of the lemma only in the case when @xmath59 and we leave the case @xmath61 as exercise for the reader .",
    "we argue by induction on the length of @xmath62 . if @xmath77 , then @xmath78 and the claim holds . for the general case , @xmath79 for some @xmath80 , @xmath81 a word over @xmath49 of length @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
