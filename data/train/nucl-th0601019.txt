    "theoretical predictions have uncertainties of the order of 20% @xcite .",
    "the theoretical neutrino flux depends on the @xmath0be(p,@xmath4)@xmath1b s - factor that needs to be known with high precision .",
    "many experimental and theoretical investigations were devoted to this reaction .",
    "experiments were performed using direct measurement techniques with proton beam and @xmath0be targets @xcite as well as by indirect methods when a @xmath1b beam breaks up into @xmath0be and proton in the coulomb field of a heavy target @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations needed to extrapolate the measured s - factor to the astrophysically relevant gamow energy were performed with several methods : the r - matrix parametrization @xcite , the potential model @xcite , and the microscopic cluster models @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we present the first calculation of the @xmath0be(p,@xmath4)@xmath1b s - factor starting from the _ ab initio _ wave functions of @xmath1b and @xmath0be .",

    "there are no adjustable or fitted parameters . within the ncsm , we study the binding energies and other nuclear structure properties of @xmath0be , @xmath1b as well as @xmath2li , and calculate overlap integrals for the @xmath1b and @xmath0be bound states . due to the use of the harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) basis",
    ", we have to correct the asymptotic behavior of the ncsm overlap integrals .",
    "this is done in two alternative ways .",
    "first , by fitting woods - saxon ( ws ) potential solutions to the interior part of the ncsm overlap integrals under the constraint that the experimental @xmath0be+p threshold is reproduced .",
    "second , by a direct matching of the ncsm overlap integrals and the whittaker function .",

    "in the ncsm , we consider a system of @xmath6 point - like non - relativistic nucleons that interact by realistic two- or two- plus three - nucleon interactions .",
    "the calculations are performed using a finite harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis . as in the present application we aim at describing loosely bound states , it is desirable to include as many terms as possible in the expansion of the total wave function . by restricting our study to two - nucleon ( nn ) interactions ,",
    "even though the ncsm allows for the inclusion of three - body forces @xcite , we are able to maximize the model space and to better observe the convergence of our results .",
    "the ncsm theory was outlined in many papers . here , we only briefly review the main points for the case when the hamiltonian is restricted to just a two - nucleon interaction .",
    "we start from the intrinsic two - body hamiltonian for the @xmath6-nucleon system @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the relative kinetic energy and @xmath9 is the sum of two - body nuclear and coulomb interactions . since we solve the many - body problem in a finite ho basis space , it is necessary that we derive a model - space dependent effective hamiltonian . for this purpose , we perform a unitary transformation @xcite of the hamiltonian , which accommodates the short - range correlations . in general",
    ", the transformed hamiltonian is an @xmath6-body operator .",
    "our simplest , yet non - trivial , approximation is to develop a two - particle cluster effective hamiltonian , while the next improvement is to include three - particle clusters , and so on .",
    "the effective interaction is then obtained from the decoupling condition between the model space and the excluded space for the two - nucleon transformed hamiltonian .",
    "details of the procedure are described in refs .",
    "the resulting two - body effective hamiltonian depends on the nucleon number @xmath6 , the ho frequency @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , the maximum many - body ho excitation energy defining the model space .",
    "it follows that the effective interaction approaches the starting bare interaction for @xmath12 .",
    "our effective interaction is translationally invariant . a significant consequence of this fact is the factorization of our wave functions into a product of a center - of - mass @xmath13 component times an internal component .",
    "our most significant approximation here is the use of the two - body cluster approximation to the effective many - body hamiltonian .",
    "our method is not variational so higher - order terms may contribute with either sign to total binding . hence , evaluating the dependence on the basis - space parameters help calibrate our convergence .",
    "once the effective interaction is derived , we diagonalize the effective hamiltonian in a slater determinant ho basis that spans a complete @xmath14 space . this is a highly non - trivial problem due to very large dimensions we encounter . to solve this problem",
    "we have used a specialized version of the shell model code antoine  @xcite , recently adapted to the ncsm  @xcite .",
    "this code works in the @xmath15 scheme for basis states , and uses the lanczos algorithm for diagonalization .",
    "its basic idea is to write the basis states as a product of two slater determinants , a proton one and a neutron one .",
    "matrix elements of operators are calculated for each separate subspace ( one - body for the proton - neutron , two - body for the proton - proton and neutron - neutron ) .",
    "the performance of the code is the best when the ratio between the number of proton plus neutron slater determinants and the dimension of the matrix is the least .",
    "it happens when the number of proton slater determinants is equal the number of the neutron slater determinants .",
    "the number of iterations needed to converge the first eigenstates is significantly reduced by the implementation of a sophisticated strategy for selecting the pivot vectors .",
    "the difficulty of the no - core calculations ( in which all nucleons are active ) is that the number of shells and , consequently , the number of matrix elements that are precalculated , becomes very large .",
    "one has to handle a huge number of operators .",
    "this is the reason why it has been necessary to write a specialized version of the code .",
    "a recent development of the ncsm is the ability to further process the wave functions , resulting from the shell - model calculation , to obtain channel cluster form factors  @xcite and , consequently , the spectroscopic factors .",
    "two different , high - precision ( i.e. such that provide a perfect fit to two - nucloen data ) nn interactions have been used in this study : the cd - bonn 2000  @xcite and the inoy ( inside nonlocal outside yukawa )  @xcite potentials .",
    "the cd - bonn 2000 potential @xcite as well as its earlier version @xcite is a charge - dependent nn interaction based on one - boson exchange .",
    "it is described in terms of covariant feynman amplitudes , which are non - local .",
    "consequently , the off - shell behavior of the cd - bonn interaction differs from local potentials which leads to larger binding energies in nuclear few - body systems .",
    "a new type of interaction , which respects the local behavior of traditional nn interactions at longer ranges but exhibits a non - locality at shorter distances , was recently proposed by doleschall _",
    "et al . _",
    "the authors explore the extent to which effects of multi - nucleon forces can be absorbed by non - local terms in the nn interaction . their goal was to investigate if it is possible to introduce non - locality in the nn interaction so that it correctly describes the three - nucleon bound states @xmath16h and @xmath16he , while still reproducing nn scattering data with high precision .",
    "the so called is version of this interaction , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , contains short - range non - local potentials in @xmath17 and @xmath18 partial waves while higher partial waves are taken from argonne @xmath19 . in this study",
    "we are using the is - m version , which includes non - local potentials also in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 waves  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that , for this particular version , the on - shell properties of the triplet @xmath20-wave interactions have been modified in order to improve the description of @xmath22 analyzing powers .",
    "the @xmath23 interaction was adjusted to become less attractive , the @xmath24 became more repulsive , and the @xmath25 more attractive .",
    "unfortunately , this gives a slightly worse fit to the nijmegen @xmath26 phase shifts .",
    "our calculations for both @xmath27 and @xmath28 nuclei were performed in model spaces up to @xmath3 for a wide range of ho frequencies .",
    "we then selected the optimal ho frequency corresponding to the ground - state energy minimum in the @xmath3 space and performed a @xmath29 calculation to obtain the ground - state energy and the point - nucleon root - mean - square ( rms ) radii .",
    "the overlap integrals as well as other observables were , however , calculated only using wave functions from up to @xmath3 spaces .    the @xmath0be ground - state energy dependence on the ho frequency for different model spaces is shown in figs .  [ be7_cdb2k_gs ] and [ be7_inoy_gs ] for the cd - bonn 2000 and the inoy nn potentials , respectively .",
    "we observe a quite different convergence trend for the two potentials .",
    "for the inoy , the convergence is very uniform with respect to the ho frequency with substantial changes with @xmath11 .",
    "the convergence with increasing @xmath11 is evident as also seen in the inset of the fig .",
    "[ be7_inoy_gs ] .",
    "it is straightforward to extrapolate that the converged inoy ground - state energy will slightly overbind @xmath0be .",
    "the ground - state energy convergence for the cd - bonn is quite different with a stronger dependence on the frequency , with minima shifting to smaller frequency with basis size increase , and an overall weaker dependence on @xmath11 .",
    "contrary to the inoy , the cd - bonn underbinds @xmath0be by more than 3 mev , which is typical for the standard high - precision nn potentials .",
    "be ground - state energy for model spaces from @xmath30 to @xmath29 obtained using the cd - bonn 2000 nn potential .",
    "the inset demonstrates how the values at the minima of each curve converge with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "[ be7_cdb2k_gs ] ]    , but using the inoy nn potential .",
    "[ be7_inoy_gs ] ]    from these results we select the optimal frequency @xmath31 mev for the cd - bonn 2000 and @xmath32 mev for the inoy potential .",
    "corresponding spectra obtained using these frequencies are then shown in figs .  [ be7_cdb2k_12 ] and [ be7_inoy_16 ] .",
    "the energies , radii and electromagnetic observables are summarized in tables  [ tab : be7energies ] and [ tab : be7moments ] , where we also include the @xmath0li results .",
    "we obtain the same level ordering for @xmath0be and @xmath0li which is also the same for both nn potentials with the exception of a reversal of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 levels .",
    "our cd - bonn ordering is in agreement with experiment for the 9 lowest levels in @xmath0li . in @xmath0be , the experimental @xmath33 and @xmath35 levels",
    "are reversed compared to our results and the situation in @xmath0li .",
    "our calculated spectra show a good convergence with the basis size enlargement as well as a good stability with respect to the frequency change .",
    "an interesting feature is a different level spacing of the @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 levels for the cd - bonn and inoy calculations .",
    "the inoy results are similar to those obtained when a three - body interaction is included in the hamiltonian @xcite .",
