    "quantum antiferromagnetic models on two - dimensional frustrated lattices provide a natural habitat for the birth of novel quantum spin - liquid states  @xcite , whose search has been a keynote of contemporary condensed matter physics  @xcite . for example , spin-@xmath0 heisenberg models defined on the kagome lattice have been shown to potentially host exotic spin liquids , sometimes with controversial findings from different numerical methods .",
    "this includes potential microscopic models for the chiral spin liquid as originally described by kalmeyer and laughlin and similar states  @xcite , the gapped ( topological ) @xmath8 spin liquid proposed to describe the properties of the nearest - neighbor model of this highly frustrated lattice  @xcite , the foundation of paradigmatic gapless spin liquids such as the @xmath6 dirac spin liquid and algebraic spin liquids  @xcite , and attempts to resolve magnetic phase diagrams assisting the experimental investigation of herbertsmithite crystals and polymorphs thereof  @xcite .",
    "another prominent candidate model conjectured to host a quantum paramagnetic ground state is the spin-@xmath0 triangular lattice with both antiferromagnetic nearest- ( @xmath1 ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath2 ) couplings  @xcite .",
    "although there are several compounds in which magnetic moments lie on stacked layers with a triangular geometry , most of them have sizable distortions , leading to spatial anisotropies along different directions  @xcite .",
    "very recently , it has been claimed that ba@xmath9cosb@xmath10o@xmath11 gives an almost perfect realization of a spin-@xmath0 equilateral triangular lattice antiferromagnet , with both @xmath1 and @xmath2 couplings  @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , the classical limit of the @xmath12 model has three different phases : for @xmath13 , the system has three - sublattice @xmath4 coplanar order , for @xmath14 it is infinitely degenerate ( with four - sublattice periodicity , in which the only constraint is to have the four spins sum to zero ) , and for @xmath15 it features generic incommensurate spiral structures . by including spin - wave fluctuations , both at the lowest ( first ) and second orders , the coplanar phase remains stable , while the accidental degeneracy of the intermediate phase is lifted in favor of a stripe collinear order with two - sublattice periodicity  @xcite . naturally , quantum paramagnetic domains tend to emerge in the vicinity of classical transition points , i.e. , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ; however , their actual stabilization is not clear within spin - wave approaches  @xcite .",
    "subsequent works have shown conflicting results on the possible existence , extent , and nature of nonmagnetic phases  @xcite .",
    "some more recent studies have vouched for the existence of a quantum paramagnet in the vicinity of @xmath16 , while the problem of the precise identification of its nature and extent in parameter space remains an open issue : a schwinger - boson approach found the corresponding window to be @xmath18 with no further clarification of the nature of the paramagnetic state  @xcite , while a high - order coupled - cluster method ( ccm ) study predicted a quantum paramagnet for @xmath19  @xcite , with a spin - triplet gap which vanishes in the entire paramagnetic regime  @xcite .",
    "in addition , two different variational monte carlo ( vmc ) studies claimed for a gapless spin liquid close to @xmath16 : kaneko and co - workers  @xcite used a full optimization of the pairing of a gutzwiller - projected bcs wave function [ obtaining a critical spin liquid for @xmath20 and mishmash and collaborators  @xcite considered few variational _ anstze _ to describe both magnetic and nonmagnetic phases ( here , they obtained evidence for a gapless nodal @xmath21-wave spin liquid for @xmath22 ) . in the former case ,",
    "the full optimization of the pairing function faces technical difficulties , which make it difficult to reach true energy minima ; in the latter one , the variational states are relatively simple and do not exhaust the rich variety of states that can be obtained within the fermionic representation of gutzwiller - projected states .",
    "indeed , the variational energies that we get are much better than those of these two papers , indicating the high accuracy of the present approach .",

    "note that the dsl found here can be represented as a resonating - valence bond spin liquid with a power - law distribution of bond amplitudes . ]    by contrast , density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) studies find a gapped @xmath7 topological spin liquid for @xmath22  @xcite and @xmath23  @xcite , with signatures of possible spontaneously broken rotational symmetry . following this proposal , zheng , mei , and qi ,  @xcite , and , in an independent work ,",
    "lu  @xcite have performed a classification of symmetric and nematic @xmath7 spin liquids , and pointed out promising candidates at the fermionic mean - field level .",
    "this approach was extended by bieri , lhuillier , and messio  @xcite to include chiral spin liquids as well .",
    "a bosonic mean - field classification has likewise been accomplished  @xcite , with some of the states addressed already in earlier works  @xcite .    in this paper , we address the @xmath24 heisenberg model on the triangular lattice from the viewpoint of versatile gutzwiller projected abrikosov - fermion wave functions ( optionally supplemented by lanczos optimization ) , which we implemented by using efficient vmc techniques . to enable a comparison of the variational energies , we also perform dmrg and lanczos diagonalizations for specific regions in parameter space . in order to resolve the magnetic susceptibility profile in the paramagnetic regime , we employ pseudofermion functional renormalization group ( pffrg ) calculations , the results of which are then compared with analogous results from dmrg and vmc .",
    "our main vmc results are summarized as follows : a spin - liquid phase is stabilized for @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) , in excellent agreement with dmrg  @xcite and ccm  @xcite . within the spin - liquid regime",
    ", however , we find no signal of stabilization for any of the gapped symmetric or nematic @xmath7 states proposed in refs .  .",
    "in particular , the gapped @xmath7 spin liquids are found to have higher energies compared to the gapless @xmath6 dirac spin liquid ( dsl ) ; the gapless @xmath7 spin liquids suffer the same fate .",
    "we find that nematic order only onsets simultaneously with collinear antiferromagnetic order , which is also supported by the analysis of nematic response functions in pffrg . on performing a couple of lanczos optimization steps on the vmc variational result , followed by a zero - variance extrapolation",
    ", we obtain estimates of the exact ground - state and @xmath26 excited - state energies on different cluster sizes .",
    "our estimate of the ground - state energy on finite - systems is in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization and other numerical methods . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "our estimate of the ground - state energy is equal to the one obtained by dmrg , within error - bars .",
    "however , in contrast to dmrg results , which found a finite spin excitation gap , the @xmath26 gap computed in vmc is found to extrapolate to zero ( within error - bars ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "these findings strongly point to a gapless spin liquid ground state , yielding a clear disagreement with the findings by dmrg .",

    "sec : results ] ) , we would like to show the results of exact diagonalizations on a small @xmath28 cluster .",
    "all eigenstates can be classified according to their quantum numbers relative to translations ( denoted by the momentum @xmath29 ) ; for particular values of @xmath29 , also @xmath44 rotations and reflections with respect to the @xmath45-axis can be specified , their quantum numbers being @xmath30 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the results for @xmath47 are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , where the energies per site of few relevant states are reported in comparison with the total - symmetric singlet with @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath48 . in particular , we show ( i ) a singlet with @xmath32 and @xmath34 , which is degenerate with the one having @xmath35 , ( ii ) a triplet with @xmath36 , which is degenerate with the one having @xmath37 , and ( iii ) a triplet with @xmath38 , degenerate with @xmath49 .",
    "the ground state is a total - symmetric singlet for @xmath50 ; for @xmath51 singlets with @xmath52 collapse on it , even having a slightly lower energy on this cluster .",
    "this fact is compatible with the rise of a phase with stripe collinear order in the thermodynamic limit ( or a spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry ) .",
    "in addition , a level crossing appears also in the triplet sector : for small values of @xmath5 , the lowest - energy triplet has @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 ) , which is compatible with the presence of @xmath4 order in the thermodynamic limit ; by contrast for larger values of @xmath5 , the lowest - energy triplet has @xmath38 ( or symmetry related momenta ) , compatible with the collinear magnetic order .",
    "unfortunately , on such a small cluster , it is impossible to establish with precision the locations of phase transitions , as well as the possible existence of a magnetically disordered phase . therefore , we address these important questions using variational wave function and functional renormalization group approaches , which are described in the ensuing section .      a traditional recipe for the construction of a spin liquid at the mean - field level  @xcite rests on the introduction of fictitious fermionic fields represented by abrikosov `` pseudofermion '' operators , @xmath53 with @xmath54 , corresponding to spin-@xmath55 , charge neutral quasi - particles , called _",
    "spinons_. the physical spin operator @xmath56 can then be expressed as a bilinear in the spinon operators  @xcite : @xmath57 where the summation over the repeated greek indices is implied and @xmath58 denotes the pauli matrices .",
    "this representation is endowed with a _",
    "@xmath59 gauge symmetry in which  @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is an @xmath59 matrix . in terms of spinon operators the hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : heis - ham ] ) acquires the form @xmath62 once the spin operator is written in terms of fermionic operators , the hilbert space is enlarged .",
    "indeed , within the original spin model , there are two states per site ( i.e. , up and down spin ) , in the fermionic representation , there are four states per site ( i.e , empty , doubly occupied , and singly occupied with up or down spin ) . therefore , in order to describe a legitimate spin state in the fermionic representation , one needs to restrict to the sub - space of exactly one - fermion per site with the local constraint : @xmath63    here , we would like to mention that both vmc and pffrg approaches enforce this constraint _ exactly _ , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] .",
    "the pffrg approach does not assume any particular starting point to treat the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ff - ham ] ) , thus avoiding to introduce any possible bias in the calculations ; by contrast , within vmc , a noninteracting state is considered ( and then projected into the correct hilbert space ) .",
    "in this respect , it is useful to briefly discuss the simplest possible approximation of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ff - ham ] ) , which consists in a mean - field treatment : @xmath64 where the operators @xmath65 and @xmath66 have been replaced by their corresponding ground - state expectation values , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively . the local constraint  ( [ eqn : constraint ] ) has been replaced by a global one , through the inclusion of a lagrangian multiplier . within this approximation , the mean - field ground state @xmath69 is obtained by diagonalizing eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mf - sl ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath69 lives in the enlarged ( i.e. , fermionic ) hilbert space and , in order to obtain a legitimate wave function for spins , one must include fluctuations around the mean - field state .",
    "in this respect , an accurate treatment of all ( spatial and temporal ) fluctuations becomes crucial . on a lattice system",
    ", it proves impossible to analytically treat all these fluctuations in an accurate manner and one has to resort to approximate methods .",
    "temporal fluctuations of the lagrange multiplier @xmath70 are particularly important , since they enforce the one - fermion per - site constraint . in the following ,",
    "we will describe two possible numerical approaches for describing the ground - state properties of the spin model .",
    "one possibility to enforce _ exactly _ the one - fermion per site constraint is to apply the gutzwiller projector to the uncorrelated wave function . in this case ,",
    "a monte carlo sampling is needed in order to compute any expectation values over variational states , since the resulting wave function includes strong correlations among the fermionic objects .",
    "our variational wave functions are defined as : @xmath71 is an uncorrelated wave function that is obtained as the ground state of a _ generic _ noninteracting hamiltonian , like the one of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mf - sl ] ) ; @xmath72 is the gutzwiller projector .",
    "notice that @xmath73 is obtained without any self - consistent requirement , as in the mean - field approach , but it is found by minimizing the energy in presence of the gutzwiller projector .",
    "in addition to the gutzwiller term , a spin - spin jastrow factor is also included to describe magnetically ordered phases : @xmath74 where , @xmath75 is a translationally invariant pseudopotential that depends upon the distance @xmath76 of two sites .",
    "all the independent parameters in the pseudopotential are optimized via monte carlo simulations . by construction ,",

    "when a particle - hole transformation is performed on down electrons : @xmath91 the mean - field hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : mf - sl ] ) commutes with the total number of particles .",

    "( [ eqn : physical - wf ] ) are optimized using an implementation of the stochastic reconfiguration ( sr ) optimization method  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to obtain an extremely accurate determination of variational parameters .",
    "indeed , small energy differences are effectively computed by using a correlated sampling , which makes it possible to strongly reduce statistical fluctuations . the current problem of the study of the instability of gapless spin liquids towards @xmath7 states will clearly demonstrate the power of this method in navigating complicated energy landscapes .    in order to have a systematic improvement of the trial variational wave function and",
    "approach the true ground state , we can apply a few lanczos steps to @xmath94  @xcite : @xmath95 s are variational parameters .",
    "the convergence of @xmath96 to the exact ground state @xmath97 is guaranteed for large @xmath98 provided the starting state is not orthogonal to @xmath97 , i.e. , for @xmath99 . on large cluster sizes ,",
    "only a few steps can be efficiently performed and here we implement the case with @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( @xmath102 corresponds to the original trial wave function ) .",
    "subsequently , an estimate of the exact ground - state energy may be achieved by the method of variance extrapolation .",
    "for sufficiently accurate states , we have that @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the energy and variance per site , respectively , whence , the exact ground - state energy @xmath106 can be extracted by fitting @xmath107 vs @xmath108 for @xmath102 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "the energy and its variance for @xmath102 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 lanczos steps are obtained using the standard variational monte carlo method .",
    "the pffrg approach  @xcite has been successfully employed to different types of hexagonal magnets  @xcite , and is also based on the decomposition of the spin operator of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : spinon ] ) , thus requiring to enforce the constraint of one fermion per site . in our formalism , the pseudofermion number fluctuations are explicitly not present , since we never allow the system to have any diagrammatic contributions that deviate from the one - pseudo - fermion per site constraint .",
    "the fermionic representation empowers one to exploit feynman diagrammatic many - body techniques on the hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : ff - ham ] ) . starting from a bare level above all spin exchange couplings at half - filling , the bare local free propagator in matsubara space",
    "is given by @xmath111 , wherein the absence of a self - energy term is just a manifestation of the fact that the fermionic hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : ff - ham ] ) does not contain any quadratic term .",
    "the global langrange parameter @xmath70 related to the single occupancy constraint falls out of the equation because of particle - hole symmetry at half filling .",
    "together , the initial formulation of the propagator along with the flow equations throughout preserve the strict locality of the propagator in real space .",
    "the pffrg framework proceeds by introducing an infrared frequency cutoff @xmath112 in the fermion propagator , and by triggering a purely imaginary self - energy term induced by the implicit diagrammatic summation , i.e. , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , resulting in a @xmath112-dependence of all @xmath115-particle vertex functions .",

    "is accomplished by the inclusion of only two - particle reducible two - loop contributions , which are found to ensure sufficient back - feeding of the self - energy corrections to the two - particle vertex evolution  @xcite .",
    "a crucial advantage of the pffrg as compared to abrikosov - type spin random phase approximation methods is that the diagrammatic summation installed by the flow incorporates vertex corrections between all interaction channels , i.e. , the two - particle vertex includes graphs that favor magnetic order and those that favor disorder in such a way that it treats both tendencies on equal footing .",

    "the largest susceptibility is the one with @xmath36 , corresponding to a coplanar order ; by contrast , for larger values of the frustrating ratio , the largest signal comes from @xmath38 that corresponds to stripe order .",

    ", the computation is performed in long cylinders ( i.e. , @xmath185 , with @xmath186 and @xmath187 ) where the spin - spin correlations are taken only inside the bulk ( i.e. , @xmath28 and @xmath167 ) . for small values of @xmath5 , the spectral weight of both pffrg and dmrg",

    "a smearing of the weight is observed , with progressively diffused peaks as one goes deeper into the disordered regime .",
    "one important difference is that pffrg gives a relatively broad paramagnetic regime , which extends from @xmath188 to @xmath189 .",
    "the fact that pffrg , due to frequency discretization and the current way of distinguishing paramagnetism from weak magnetic order , estimates a larger paramagnetic regime than vmc is consistent with previous results on the @xmath12 heisenberg model on the kagome lattice  @xcite . by further increasing the frustrating ratio ,",
    "the collinear antiferromagnetic phase is reached and the weight shifts along the boundary of the brillouin zone , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig13 ] . in dmrg",
    ", one observes that this shift of weight is very sudden upon going from @xmath190 to @xmath191 .",
    "in contrast , in pffrg the transfer of weight occurs much more gradually and starts for larger values of @xmath192 . despite these quantitative deviations ,",
    "the pffrg is accurate in tracking the central correlation profiles , enabling a comparison across methods .",
    "in particular , pffrg is seen to provide a reliable short - range correlation profile of a phase , whereas the estimation of long - distance correlations shows more quantitative deviations .    to address the issue of the possible nematic nature of the quantum paramagnetic phase , we have computed within pffrg the nematic response function @xmath193 eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nem - response ] ) .",
    "we observe that for any given ratio @xmath5 there is an enhancement of @xmath193 under the rg flow , and as one increases the ratio of @xmath5 , the nematic response increases in a continuous manner up till @xmath180 where the system goes into collinear stripe antiferromagnetic order .",
    "however , throughout the paramagnetic regime , we do not observe any sudden pronounced increase of nematic responses that would indicate an onset of nematic order , and it is likely that the ground state found within pffrg is symmetric .",
    "to summarize , the energy per site obtained by vmc and dmrg for the hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : heis - ham ] ) around @xmath194 are equal within error - bars",
    ". nevertheless , while both vmc and dmrg agree on the fact that a magnetically disordered phase is present close to the classical transition point , there are still discrepancies about the nature of this spin - liquid phase .",
    "vmc finds an isotropic gapless @xmath6 dirac spin liquid as opposed to the dmrg results of a ( potentially nematic ) gapped @xmath8 spin liquid . as we add pffrg to the picture in computing the spin susceptibility profile , we find that the predominant short - range features such as peak enhancements at the corners of the brillouin zone seem to be a common feature of nearly the whole paramagnetic domain around @xmath194 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig12 ] ) ; however , from the equal - time spin structure factor computed by vmc , this fact is shared by _ both _",
    "the dsl and the symmetric @xmath195 state [ see figs .  [",
    "fig : fig10](a ) and  [ fig : fig10](b ) ] . this short - range spin susceptibility picture",
    "is mainly confirmed by dmrg , whereas the nematic tendencies have not been found by vmc or pffrg , and could possibly be rooted in the breaking of lattice point group symmetries from the outset , as found in the cylindrical geometries employed by dmrg .",
    "the latter can not be the reason for the different findings from vmc and dmrg , as again , even allowing for nematic trial states in vmc still gives preference to the symmetric state .",
    "how can different numerical methods find different ground states with equal energy per site and nearly identical short - range spin susceptibility profiles ?",
    "the controversy is likely to be rooted in the subtle interplay between short - range and long - range correlations , and how these are accounted for numerically .",
    "it is a well established feature that the long - wavelength behavior is difficult to pin down just by energetics , as , e.g. , recently pointed out in ref .",
    "this , in turn , is the only aspect by which the competing candidate states differentiate themselves : as bulk gaps become small the distinction between a gapless and a gapped state does become a matter of long - range correlations which might not be accurately taken into account from the viewpoint of energy densities .",
    "for the dsl predominantly found in vmc , not only for eq .",
    "( [ eqn : heis - ham ] ) but also for the heisenberg model on the kagome lattice , one line of criticism comes from the fact that there are no rigorous proofs that dirac nodes in the fermion spectrum are stable in presence of @xmath6 gauge fields ( e.g. , a monopole proliferation is expected to generate a gapped phase ) . for the gapped spin liquids predominantly found in dmrg , there is threat of a bias toward lower entangled state , which likewise adds to the picture . in any case , because of the energy per site being even equal within error - bars for very different states , the paramagnetic regime of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : heis - ham ] ) is likely to become the paradigmatic test - bed for future investigations along these lines .",
    "in this work , we have shown that gutzwiller - projected fermionic wave functions predicts a spin - liquid phase in the frustrated heisenberg model on the triangular lattice , for @xmath25 .",
    "this results is in excellent agreement with previous dmrg calculations  @xcite ( and also coupled - cluster results of ref .  [ ] ) , providing an extremely competitive candidate to describe the paramagnetic ground state , namely the algebraic @xmath6 dirac spin liquid .",
    "this fact contrasts the dmrg finding of a gapped ( possibly nematic ) @xmath7 spin liquid .",
    "the existence of a magnetically disordered phase is also confirmed by pffrg , which , however , can not give definitive claims in the existence / absence of a spin gap . although the issue of the gap is very important and must be definitively settled down in the future , we would like to conclude by emphasizing the fact that , huge improvements of numerical techniques ( including variational wave functions , dmrg approaches in two spatial dimensions , and pffrg for spin models ) have been done in the recent past , allowing the community to reach considerably important results in various contexts .",
    "the agreement on the ground - state energies in a wide parameter regime , but also on the extent of the spin - liquid phase , represents a milestone from which other calculations will proceed .",

    "<S> b * 92 * , 140403 ( 2015 ) ] ] , we employ the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) approach to analyze the model from an alternative perspective that considers both magnetically ordered and paramagnetic trial states . </S>",
    "<S> we find a quantum paramagnet in the regime @xmath3 , framed by @xmath4 coplanar ( stripe collinear ) antiferromagnetic order for smaller ( larger ) @xmath5 . by considering the optimization of spin - liquid wave functions of a different gauge group and lattice point group content </S>",
    "<S> as derived from abrikosov mean - field theory , we obtain the gapless @xmath6 dirac spin liquid as the energetically most preferable state in comparison to all symmetric or nematic gapped @xmath7 spin liquids so far advocated by dmrg . moreover , by the application of few lanczos iterations , we find the energy to be the same as the dmrg result within error - bars . to further resolve the intriguing disagreement between vmc and dmrg , we complement our methodological approach by the pseudofermion functional renormalization group ( pffrg ) to compare the spin structure factors for the paramagnetic regime calculated by vmc , dmrg , and pffrg . </S>",
    "<S> this model promises to be an ideal test - bed for future numerical refinements in tracking the long - range correlations in frustrated magnets . </S>"
