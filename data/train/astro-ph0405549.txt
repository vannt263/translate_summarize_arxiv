    "the origin of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) above @xmath0ev ( @xmath6eev ) is a mystery since many years  @xcite .",
    "several next - generation experiments , most notably the pierre auger experiment now under construction  @xcite and the euso project  @xcite are now trying to solve this mystery .",
    "although statistically meaningful information about the uhecr energy spectrum and arrival direction distribution has been accumulated , no conclusive picture for the nature and distribution of the sources emerges naturally from the data .",
    "there is on the one hand the approximate isotropic arrival direction distribution  @xcite which indicates that we are observing a large number of weak or distant sources . on the other hand",
    ", there are also indications which point more towards a small number of local and therefore bright sources , especially at the highest energies : first , the agasa ground array claims statistically significant multi - plets of events from the same directions within a few degrees  @xcite , although this is controversial  @xcite and has not been seen so far by the fluorescence experiment hires  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of this clustered component is @xmath7 and thus much harder than the total spectrum  @xcite .",
    "second , nucleons above @xmath8eev suffer heavy energy losses due to photo - pion production on the cosmic microwave background  the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect  @xcite  which limits the distance to possible sources to less than @xmath9mpc  @xcite .",
    "heavy nuclei at these energies are photo - disintegrated in the cosmic microwave background within a few mpc  @xcite . for",
    "a uniform source distribution this would predict a `` gzk cutoff '' , a drop in the spectrum .",
    "however , the existence of this `` cutoff '' is not established yet from the observations  @xcite .",
    "the picture is further complicated by the likely presence of large scale extra - galactic magnetic fields ( egmf ) that will lead to deflection of any charged uhecr component .",
    "magnetic fields are omnipresent in the universe , but their true origin is still unclear  @xcite . magnetic fields in galaxies are observed with typical strengths of a few micro gauss , but there are also some indications for fields correlated with larger structures such as galaxy clusters  @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields as strong as @xmath10 in sheets and filaments of the large scale galaxy distribution , such as in our local supercluster , are compatible with existing upper limits on faraday rotation  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that fossil cocoons of former radio galaxies , so called radio ghosts , contribute significantly to the isotropization of uhecr arrival directions  @xcite .",
    "only recently attempts have been made to simulate uhecr propagation in a realistically structured and magnetized universe based on large scale structure simulations  @xcite .",
    "these two simulations used different models for the egmf : whereas seed fields were continuously injected at shocks in ref .",
    "@xcite , ref .",
    "@xcite started from uniform seed fields . in both cases ,",
    "the seed field strength had to be normalized to reproduce observed rotation measures .",
    "interestingly , the egmf in ref .",
    "@xcite is considerably more extended and leads to much larger average deflections than in ref .",
    "the main reason is probably due to the different egmf models .",
    "this suggests that the influence of egmf on uhecr propagation is currently hard to quantify .",
    "the two works agree , however , at least in the following : first , the observer is most likely situated in a region with relatively weak egmf , @xmath11 g . in ref .",
    "@xcite which used an unconstrained large scale structure simulation , this was deduced from comparison of predicted and observed uhecr anisotropies , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite this followed from their constrained simulation which is supposed to lead to an approximate model of our local extra - galactic environment .",
    "second , the fields are not strong and extended enough to allow an interpretation of the large scale isotropy of uhecr arrival directions by only one nearby source , as suggested in ref .",
    "finally , both these works were restricted to nucleons .",
    "heavy nuclei may further complicate the issue and lead to large deflection even in the egmf scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper we study uhecr spectra , composition and angular distribution from individual discrete sources injecting protons or nuclei into a highly structured egmf which is significant only in the neighborhood of the source .",
    "this is different from the more idealized monte carlo simulations for individual sources in refs .",
    "@xcite in the following points : the egmf in these earlier simulations was idealized by a kolmogorov spectrum with a possible coherent component , with a field energy density either following a gaussian profile  @xcite or being constant  @xcite , or as organized in spatial cells with a given coherence length and a strength depending as a power law on the local density  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the observer was immersed in fields of similar strength as the source , and these simulations were restricted to nucleons .    in the context of a highly structured egmf it was already found that the auto - correlation function at degree scales decreases with source magnetization and can thus be used as a signature for magnetic fields  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will find that even if off - sets of arrival directions from the source direction are moderate , spectra and composition are considerably modified if the source is surrounded by egmf of the order @xmath12 g on scales of a few mpc .    in sect .",
    "2 we describe our simulations , in sect .",
    "3 the results are presented , and we conclude in sect .",
    "we will specifically study two cases where the location of the observer and source are chosen from the large scale structure simulation used in ref .",
    "@xcite , see ref .  @xcite . in the first case",
    "the source is at a distance of 3.3 mpc , similar to the starburst galaxy m82 or the radio galaxy centaurus a. the field strength at the observer is @xmath13 g , whereas the source is immersed in fields of @xmath1 g .",
    "we will denote this scenario by `` m82 '' . in the second case ,",
    "the source is immersed in a galaxy cluster at 18.6 mpc distance , reminiscent of the virgo cluster .",
    "the field strength at the observer is @xmath14 g , whereas the source is immersed in fields of a few @xmath12 g on scales of several mpc .",
    "we will denote this scenario by `` virgo '' .",
    "these two cases are visualized in fig .",
    "we consider the steady state situation which amounts to assuming that these sources are active on time scales at least as long as the propagation time . in this case",
    "observables are time independent .         the trajectory simulations are performed as described in ref .",
    "these simulations were generalized to include heavy nuclei and follow all secondary trajectories produced by photo - disintegration reactions , in the way described in ref .",
    "interactions taken into account thus include pair production by protons , pion production , and photo - disintegration on the combined cosmic microwave , infrared / optical and radio photon backgrounds . for the latter , standard estimates were used , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .    for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that nuclei are accelerated with a spectrum @xmath15 up to a fixed maximal energy @xmath16ev , and we will restrict ourselves to either proton or iron primaries at injection .",
    "these are reasonable assumptions for radio galaxies  @xcite .",
    "we note that active galaxies are likely to accelerate heavy nuclei to ultra - high energies , see refs  @xcite for discussions .",
    "the observer is modeled as a sphere and a trajectory is accepted and observationally relevant quantities are saved every time it crosses this sphere . for each scenario @xmath17 arriving trajectories were simulated .",
    "galactic magnetic fields lead to deflections of maximally a few tens of degrees above @xmath0ev and can therefore be neglected as long as one is mainly interested in spectra and chemical composition .",

    "the normalizations are chosen such that this individual source can contribute at least partly to the measured uhecr flux at the highest energies . at lower energies",

    "the horizontal line corresponds to the rectilinear propagation time.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]        there are several notable features for the nearby source `` m82 '' which we will discuss in turn : it is first of all apparent that whereas without fields the spectrum is only slightly modified due to the small source distance , the magnetized case leads to a strong modification of the spectrum .",
    "this can be understood by comparing the time delay due to propagation in the egmf , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , with typical energy loss times , shown in fig .",
    "the two time scales can indeed be comparable .",
    "furthermore , the spectra shown in figs .  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] refer to the steady state situation relevant as long as the source emission characteristics do not change considerably on the time scale of typical time delays .",
    "this may cease to be realistic at low energies where time delays reach several hundred million years according to fig .",
    "sources which were inactive at such times before the present would thus not be visible around @xmath0ev today , because such uhecr would not have reached us yet .",
    "this would produce a strong cut - off at low energies .",
    "we are here dealing with highly structured egmf concentrated on scales of a few mpc , with a typical r.m.s .",
    "strength @xmath19 and coherence length @xmath20 .",
    "as long as the latter is not much smaller than the length scale over which the egmf extends , the transition from rectilinear propagation to diffusion roughly occurs when the larmor radius @xmath21 becomes comparable to @xmath20 , or at @xmath22 for @xmath23 the time delay scales asymptotically as @xmath24 , whereas in the rectilinear regime @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ et ] ) , for light nuclei and @xmath26kpc this transition occurs indeed between @xmath0ev and @xmath27ev , consistent with what is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the branch with large delay times .",
    "this is consistent with the simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite which has weaker and less extended fields than used in our simulations , but where in typical galaxy clusters protons diffuse nevertheless up to several @xmath0ev , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another conspicuous feature in case of iron primaries is a rise of the spectrum towards lower energies at @xmath28ev , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , whose strength depends , however , considerably on the detailed egmf realization .",
    "this energy roughly coincides with @xmath29 where @xmath30 for iron .",
    "it is thus given by the maximal energies of nucleons produced as secondaries by iron photo - disintegration .",
    "this is confirmed by the average atomic mass as a function of energy shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] which shows a sharp drop at the same energy @xmath31ev due to these nucleons .",
    "since such nucleons at energy @xmath32 are produced by the flux of nuclei at energy @xmath33 , their effect is visible only for injection spectra not much softer than @xmath4 . the nucleon threshold is visible also in a branch of events with delay times @xmath34s around @xmath35eev in fig .",
    "this branch is an almost identical copy of the analogous heavy nuclei branch with the same delay times at energies @xmath36 times higher .",
    "it is thus due to photo - disintegration of these nuclei into nucleons away from the source where the weak magnetic field hardly adds any time delay .",
    "finally , again for iron primaries , the spectrum is considerably hardened in two energy intervals stretching over about half an order of magnitude , at @xmath37ev and at @xmath38 , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , left panel .",
    "these two intervals are off - set from each other by roughly the charge of the iron primaries , @xmath39 .",
    "a similar hardening is seen for proton primaries in the observed spectrum below @xmath40ev , see fig .",

    "in contrast , in our inhomogeneous scenarios the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath62 depends more weakly on @xmath32 because lower energy particles diffuse to larger distances from the source during their larger energy loss time .",

    "[ fig3 ] , and fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] below .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that our scenarios are highly inhomogeneous , the diffusion approximation strictly speaking does not apply far from the source , and these arguments can thus be considered only as approximate at best .",
    "monte carlo simulations are indispensable in this situation .    in order to test how much the results depend on the detailed realization of egmf and source",
    ", we also performed simulations in which the exact source position is varied within 1 - 2 mpc within the general structures shown in fig .",
    "we find that the general tendency to spectral hardening at energies where uhecr diffuse in the vicinity of the source is always seen .",
    "however , the detailed shape of the predicted observable spectra depends considerably on the concrete structure of the egmf .",
    "this is due to magnetic lensing  @xcite which leads to flux enhancements along specific propagation paths at specific energies , especially if there are field lines connecting source and observer .",

    "note that for a given normalization of the observed spectrum , iron primaries require a somewhat higher injection power because a higher fraction of the injected energy is degraded below @xmath0ev during propagation due to spallation .",

    "finally , the unknown egmf structure translates into uncertainties in the required power of about an order of magnitude . given these uncertainties of the injection spectrum and its continuation below @xmath0ev ,",

    "the effects of the egmf surrounding the source , although more extended than in the scenario `` m82 '' , are here relatively smaller .",

    "we find that such source fields can strongly modify spectra and composition at earth , especially for nearby sources for which the fields can considerably modify propagation times relative to both energy loss and photo - disintegration time scales and to the undeflected propagation time .",
    "we found the following generic features :    the spectra are considerably hardened relative to the injection spectrum at energies below the usual gzk - like cutoff where energy loss distance and source distance become comparable .",
    "this is caused by an interplay between diffusion and energy loss : the flux of low energy particles is suppressed because diffusion spreads them out over a larger volume due to their much larger energy loss times .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of uniformly distributed magnetic fields which in general lead to a steepening of the cosmic ray flux below the gzk cutoff . a hardened sub - gzk spectrum from individual sources",
    "would be consistent with hints of a hard clustered component in the agasa data between @xmath0ev and @xmath27ev  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for a nucleus of atomic mass @xmath2 as injected primary , due to the kinematics of the photo - disintegration reactions a nucleon peak appears at energy @xmath80 , where @xmath3 is the maximal nucleus injection energy .",

    "further cutoffs towards low energies can be induced if the source is active only since a time smaller than the typical delay time at this energy .",
    "obviously , the characteristics of such features also depend on unknown details of the source .",
    "our simulations finally show that even for iron primaries , extra - galactic magnetic fields from large scale structure simulations are not strong and extended enough to explain the observed large scale isotropy of ultra high energy cosmic ray arrival directions in terms of a single nearby source .",

    "next generation experiments such as the pierre auger observatories  @xcite and the euso project  @xcite will accumulate sufficient statistics to establish spectra and distributions of composition and arrival directions from individual sources . a potentially strong influence of magnetic fields surrounding individual sources should thus be kept in mind when interpreting data from these experiments .",

    "<S> we investigate the dependence of composition , spectrum and angular distributions of ultra - high energy cosmic rays above @xmath0ev from individual sources on their magnetization . we find that , especially for sources within a few megaparsecs from the observer , observable spectra and composition are severely modified if the source is surrounded by fields of @xmath1 g on scales of a few megaparsecs . </S>",
    "<S> low energy particles diffuse over larger distances during their energy loss time . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to considerable hardening of the spectrum up to the energy where the loss distance becomes comparable to the source distance . </S>",
    "<S> magnetized sources thus have very important consequences for observations , even if cosmic rays arrive within a few degrees from the source direction . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , details in spectra and chemical composition may be intrinsically unpredictable because they depend on the unknown magnetic field structure . </S>",
    "<S> if primaries are predominantly nuclei of atomic mass @xmath2 accelerated up to a maximum energy @xmath3 with spectra not much softer than @xmath4 , secondary protons from photo - disintegration can produce a conspicuous peak in the spectrum at energy @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a related feature appears in the average mass dependence on energy .    </S>",
