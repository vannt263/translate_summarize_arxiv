    "the generalized inverse gamma ( giga ) function ( appendix [ giga_scale ] ) belongs to a family of distributions ( appendix [ giga_ln ] ) , which includes inverse gamma ( iga ) , lognormal ( ln ) , gamma ( ga ) and generalized gamma ( gga ) . the remarkable property of giga is its power - law tail ; for a general three - parameter case , the power - law exponent is given by the negative @xmath0 , so that @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "giga emerges as a steady state distribution in a number of problems , from a network model of economy , @xcite to ontogenetic mass growth , @xcite to response times in human cognition .",
    "@xcite this common feature can be traced to a birth - death phenomenological model subject to stochastic perturbations ( appendix [ birth_death ] ) . here",
    "we argue that the giga distribution best describes stock volatility distribution and the product distribution ( appendix [ product_distribution ] ) of giga and normal ( n ) distributions , giga*n , best describes stock returns distribution .",
    "numerically , we used the maximum likelihood method to determine the best parameters for each of the distributions in the above family of distributions and found that giga provides the best fit for vix and vxo volatility data .",
