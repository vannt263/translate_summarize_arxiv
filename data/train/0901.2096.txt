    "the 30@xmath0doradus  region of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is an ideal laboratory in which to study the effect of massive star formation and its feedback on the circumcluster interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "star formation processes in the magellanic clouds  are potentially a template for the early universe , where small irregular galaxies were commonplace and the overall metallicity lower . in particular ,",
    "the star formation rate measured relative to molecular mass may be high in the lmc compared to our galaxy , but that measurement is complicated by interpretation of co data in molecular clouds that are known to be more porous and deeply penetrated by ultraviolet radiation , and an uncertain co - h@xmath3 conversion factor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "30@xmath0doradus  itself , the brightest star formation region in the lmc , contains several m@xmath4  of molecular hydrogen traced by @xmath5co(1 - 0 ) @xcite , much of which is in two elongated clouds that form an arc or ridge in the center of the nebula ( see figure  [ threecoloroverview ] for a multiwavelength view and figure  [ bwoverview ] for the distribution of co ) . that molecular material is probably only the remnant of the cloud that formed the central cluster and thousands of ob stars .",
    "observations of higher energy co transitions suggest that this remnant ridge of molecular gas is quite warm and dense @xcite , and near - infrared observations have revealed that it is actively forming new stars @xcite    the dominant star - forming cluster of the 30@xmath0doradus  h@xmath6ii  region is ngc 2070 , whose dense center , r136 , is usually considered the nearest super star cluster ( ssc ) .",
    "r136 contains 39 o3 stars , a total stellar mass of @xmath75m@xmath4  within 2.5 pc , and stellar densities exceeding 5m@xmath4pc@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "extragalactic sscs are the hosts of one of the most extreme modes of star formation in the universe , may develop into globular clusters , and play a key role in galaxy formation @xcite . at a distance of 50@xmath92.5 kpc ( see discussion of the lmc distance and uncertainty in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 30@xmath0doradus  is close enough to study at the parsec - scale resolution that is required to understand the formation and feedback effects of individual stars , and a prime target for detailed study of the same mechanisms which operate in more distant and massive sscs .    observations at mid - infrared ( mir ) wavelengths offer several advantages for studying star formation and its interaction with circumcluster dust and gas .",
    "mir ( here roughly defined as 5 - 50@xmath10 m ) continuum emission is generally dominated by radiation from very small dust grains ( vsgs ) ; the broad shape of the continuum is sensitive to the vsg size and temperature distribution , and hence indirectly to the radiation intensity in photon - dominated regions , and to the destruction of smaller grains as would be expected above 2000k and in h@xmath6ii  regions .",
    "broad ( @xmath111@xmath10 m ) dust emission features are also present between 3 and 19@xmath10 m . these previously named `` unidentified infrared bands '' result from distortion ( bending , stretching ) modes of aromatic molecules containing tens to hundreds of carbon atoms .",

    "analysis of relative strengths of pah features reveals their size and ionization state which is expected to change in intense radiation fields .",
    "extinction by dust in the infrared is low compared to other wavelength regimes .",
    "observations in the mir can pierce cold molecular clouds and reveal the star - forming regions that they shroud .",
    "there are two major bands of absorption by silicate dust at 9.7 and 18@xmath10 m , whose shape and strength provide further diagnostics of the dust in the region .",
    "mid - infrared ( mir ) spectroscopy of the entire 30@xmath0doradus  region with _ iso - sws _",
    "@xcite revealed a continuum - dominated spectrum with very weak silicate absorption and also only modestly strong aromatic emission features .",
    "the 4 spectra taken in 30@xmath0doradus  with isophot @xcite similarly show low ratios of pah strength to ir continuum .",

    "the goals of sage are to conduct a detailed study of the dust processes in the ism , to complete a census of newly formed stars in order to find the star formation rate in the lmc , and to study evolved stars with high mass loss rates in order to determine the rate of mass injection into the ism @xcite .",
    "figure  [ threecoloroverview ] places the mir emission from 30@xmath0doradus  in its multiwavelength context .",
    "8@xmath10 m  emission traces the same arc - shaped ridge seen in the optical , delineating the edge of a bubble probably blown by r136 and filled with hot x - ray emitting plasma . the remaining molecular material in the region is also located in that ridge .",
    "this paper presents a new spatially filled spectral cube of 30@xmath0doradus  with the low - resolution modules of _",
    "spitzer_/irs @xcite and with the sed mode of _",
    "the sensitivity of this dataset greatly exceeds the previous isocam - cvf data @xcite , which only provided maps of the few strongest ionic lines , but tentatively showed a gradient of decreasing excitation in the [ ] / [ ]  ratio as a function of distance from r136 , and signs of pah destruction in the central regions of the nebula .",
    "the data are described in sections  [ observations ] . in particular ,  [ datared ] and appendix  [ appendix1 ] discusses reduction and artifacts ,  [ fitting ] the line and feature fitting procedure , and appendix  [ appendix2 ] quality assurance tests including a comparison with high - resolution irs data from @xcite . in  [ maps ] we describe the general results  the spatial distribution of emission lines and their ratios .

    "[ density ] describes the derived distribution of matter  electron density and dust , and  [ excitation ] the distribution of radiation evident in the excitation of the gas .",

    "the _ spitzer _ s infrared spectrograph has @xmath12100 times greater spectroscopic sensitivity than the previous premier infrared observatory , _ iso - sws _ , and @xmath1210 times higher spatial resolution than the sws aperture size .",
    "we used the four low resolution  modules of the irs .",
    "the spectral resolution ranges from 60 to 120 @xcite , with reliable wavelength coverage as noted in section [ finaladjustments ] .",
    "the four modules are the short wavelength / low resolution  second order ( sl2 ) , short wavelength / low resolution  first order ( sl1 ) , long wavelength / low resolution  second order ( ll2 ) , and long wavelength / low resolution  first order ( ll1 ) .",
    "our data is divided into eighteen astronomical observing requests ( aors ) , each containing many bcd ( basic calibrated data ) frames , which are pipeline - processed images of the irs chip .",
    "we observed 30@xmath0doradus  over five days in september of 2006 , using _",
    "spitzer s _ spectral mapping mode in order to obtain detailed spatial information .",
    "the total amount of time on target was 74 hours .",
    "we used 3440 slit pointings , covering 40.5 square arcminutes in the short - wavelength modules and 69.1 square arcminutes in the long - wavelength modules ( see figure [ irscoverage ] ) .",
    "each slit overlaps half of the preceding one , and each row of slits overlaps half of the preceding row , so every point on the map was observed at four separate slit pointings .",
    "there were three repetitions per pointing for the sl observations , at 14 seconds each ( for a total time of 168 s for each point on the sl maps ) , and four repetitions per pointing for the ll observations , at 6 seconds each ( for a total time of 96 s for each point on the ll maps ) .",
    "the result is four large and dense spectral cubes , one for each module .",
    "we also made separate observations of a nearby region of comparatively blank sky , bracketing our target observations in time , to comprise background observations and to better characterize rogue pixel response .",
    "the total time on background was 44 minutes .",
    "we used the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) from the spitzer science center pipeline version s14.4.0 .",
    "the main tool for the assembly and reduction of our data cube was cubism @xcite , which is designed for spatially dense irs maps .",
    "the functions of cubism include tools to reduce the data ( subtracting background , applying a slit loss correction function , trimming the slit in the spatial direction , masking pixels that are flagged by the pipeline , and applying algorithms to identify rogue pixels ) and to extract spectra and maps from the data cube .",
    "appendix  [ appendix1 ] describes in detail our procedure for calibrating and adjusting the flux levels such that the different spectrograph modules could be combined into smooth spectra . in brief , we used contemporaneous off - source background observations to subtract the thermal background .",
    "we used measurements of the slit - loss correction function provided by the _ spitzer _",
    "science center to undo that part of their point - source - based calibration ( since our observations are more similar to a uniform diffuse source than a point source ) . finally , we adjusted spectra from different modules to match each other .",
    "appendix  [ appendix2 ] describes our comparisons of high and low - resolution spectra in 30@xmath0doradus  to test the fidelity of our fitting process .",
    "we find that the strengths of even somewhat blended lines are recovered well in the low - resolution spectra .",
    "there are two major artifacts which appear in a 2-d map of our data cube at any given wavelength . in all four modules , there are numerous faint stripes , one pixel wide , which cross the map in the direction that the slit scans . in the two sl modules ,",
    "there is a broad intensity discontinuity and associated bright region in one area of the map .",
    "the affected region varies with wavelength .",
    "the faint stripes appear to be mainly caused by hot pixels on the irs chip .",
    "as the slit was stepped across 30@xmath0doradus , each hot pixel was `` dragged '' across the map , creating a bright stripe . they can be eliminated via two cleaning methods : wavsamp trimming and rogue pixel masking .",
    "the intensity discontinuity is caused by saturation in the peak - up image , and must be corrected by fitting a correction factor to the regions of the chip between the sl modules .    the spitzer science center has defined a polygon , called the wavsamp , defining the active area to extract from the irs chip for each module . in the case of 30@xmath0doradus , the default wavsamp tends to be too generous in the spatial direction , including a few pixels where the spectral response is reduced . by trimming it , we were able to eliminate some of the faint stripe artifacts .",
    "it is possible to determine which pixels on the irs chip contribute to a given point in the data cube , using a cubism tool called backtracking .",
    "backtracking from the artifacts in the maps demonstrated that most , if not all , of the remaining faint stripes are caused by individual rogue pixels , whether hot or cold .",
    "in addition to masking the pixels automatically flagged by the spitzer science center pipeline , we employed cubism s automatic rogue pixel masking algorithms at both the global and record levels . at the global level",
    ", we masked any pixel which deviated by at least 2.5 sigma from the median pixel level in at least 35% of the records .",
    "at the record level , it was necessary to be much more conservative to avoid masking out real spectral features .",
    "we masked any pixel which deviated by at least 7.5 sigma in 70% of its occurrences in the cube .",
    "the procedure missed some pixels which were clearly hot or cold , so we also manually marked a set of global and record level rogue pixels .",
    "in the resulting cubes , the faint stripes were greatly reduced .",
    "the other major artifact , the intensity discontinuity , is caused by saturated sources on the peak - up image ( pui ) , primarily by bright point sources in the northern part of the region which are marked in white in figure [ saturationmap ] .",
    "the northernmost of these is the source marked in yellow in figure [ threecoloroverview ] . by examining the records associated with the affected region on the map",
    ", we can see that where a source saturates several neighboring pixels in the peak - up image , there is a bleed - over effect that reduces the response of the rest of the irs chip ( bcd image ) in those rows , and may increase the response in neighboring rows .",
    "the result is broad , uneven dark or bright stripes in a 2d map extracted from the cube .",
    "the location varies with wavelength because as the pui is scanned across the bright source in space , the artifact changes position on the bcd frame , i.e. changes wavelength . simply masking all affected pixels at the record level results in holes in the maps at many wavelengths . instead , we chose to mend the response .",
    "we selected all rows that intersected a group of saturated pixels on the peak - up image , with a margin of two rows on either side .",
    "these are the affected rows .",
    "we found the continuum level in adjacent rows , excluding major emission lines , and linearly interpolated across the affected rows . in the case of affected rows that corresponded to continuum emission , we replaced the values with the interpolated values . in the case of affected rows that corresponded to atomic or pah emission , we attempted to restore the base continuum level below the emission line by adding the interpolated value , and subtracting out the median value of the affected rows in the region between the sl1 and sl2 chips , which is the bias level of the affected rows .",
    "the artifact is reduced , though not eliminated .",
    "the result is a complete cube , but with localized regions that have larger uncertainty in the sl1 and sl2 modules ( see the cyan and magenta regions marked in figure [ saturationmap ] ) . for the purposes of presentation ,",
    "the areas where the artifact s effect is still distinct have been cropped out of each map .    at some wavelengths in the sl cubes , a large region of somewhat elevated emission",
    "is still visible after our corrections .",
    "this artifact appears to be another result of the saturation in the peak - up images . after a saturation event ,",
    "the response of the chip is elevated for the remainder of the aor .",
    "the resulting artifact , which can be seen in maps at a variety of wavelengths ( for example , 5.2 , 6.3 and 10.7@xmath10 m ) , is localized in space .",
    "this low - level artifact is also generally reduced in continuum - subtracted images , because the effect is broad on the bcd frame , and thus broad in wavelength as well .",
    "hot dust emission is responsible for the overall shape of the continuum in 30@xmath0doradus  and its strong rise toward the red . using the fitting package pahfit @xcite",
    ", we fit the continuum with an assortment of four thermal functions from 40 to 300k and a stellar blackbody of 5000k ( the fit is insensitive to exact temperature as long as it peaks blueward of our shortest wavelength 5@xmath10 m ) .",
    "the integrated spectrum of the entire region is shown below in figure  [ entirespec ] , and astrophysically interesting spectra are described below in  [ sources_text ] .",
    "the broad pah bands and unresolved atomic lines are blended in some parts of the spectrum . in order to decompose them",
    ", we fit the whole suite of emission lines at once .",
    "detailed analysis of the dust features will be addressed in a future work .",
    "the feature of greatest potential concern is blending of [ ] @xmath1312.8@xmath10 m  with the 12.7@xmath10 m  pah feature .",
    "the pah contribution is much lower than the atomic line over much of 30@xmath0doradus . in particular",
    ", @xcite found that at the higher spectral resolution of _ iso - sws _ , the 12.7@xmath10 m  pah feature was undetectable relative to [ ] @xmath1312.8@xmath10 m  within the two _ iso - sws _ apertures ( located on the ridge )  the lowest ratio of pah to [ ]  of any h@xmath6ii  region they studied .",
    "we used comparisons with high - resolution spectra ( see appendix  [ qasec ] ) and tests in parts of 30@xmath0doradus  that should be completely pah - free , like the core of r136 , to determine that the joint fitting of those two features is robust in 30@xmath0doradus  and uncertainties are properly accounted for .",
    "we also made contemporaneous observations of 30@xmath0doradus  using the sed mode of the mips @xcite .",
    "the raw data are responsivity - corrected , dark - subtracted , and illumination - corrected using the mips germanium pipeline @xcite , with the difference that the illumination correction is derived from galactic cirrus rather than zodiacal light .",
    "wavelength correction is derived from observations of bright planetary nebula . since 30@xmath0doradus  is so bright , we use the chopped `` background '' area simply as additional on - source observation , and assume that the thermal background is much less intense than the emission from the nebula itself . as with the irs data , mapping the area with offsets equal to half of the slit width , perpendicular to the slit direction , yields a fully sampled spectral cube , with resolution @xmath1425 .",
    "even with such poor resolution , we detect [ ] @xmath1357.3@xmath10 m  with high significance over most of the map , and tentatively [ ] @xmath1363.1@xmath10 m  in the very center (  [ emission ] ) .",
    "the shape of the dust continuum will be discussed in a future publication on the dust content of 30@xmath0doradus , but we note that the sed peaks shortward of 75@xmath10 m , consistent with very high average dust temperatures ( figure  [ entirespec ] ) .",
    "figure  [ entirespec ] shows the integrated spectrum of 30@xmath0doradus , with dust and atomic features labeled .",
    "the overall continuum shape is typical of hot small dust grains in h@xmath6ii  regions .",
    "the mips / sed data clearly show that the spectral energy distribution of the entire nebula peaks shortward of 70@xmath10 m , indicating a quite warm average dust temperature . a full discussion of dust properties will be the subject of a subsequent publication .",
    "we note that the aromatic features are well - detected but not extremely strong - comparable to galactic compact h@xmath6ii  regions or compact blue galaxies , and weaker than the integrated spectra of entire spiral galaxies or the diffuse emission of the milky way @xcite .",
    "the equivalent width of the 6.2@xmath10 m  feature , averaged over this large aperture , is 0.61@xmath10 m .",
    "in particular , the weak 17@xmath10 m feature may indicate a dearth of large neutral pahs @xcite in this intensely ionized environment .",
    "the strongest spectral features are the ionic emission lines which are sensitive to physical conditions in the ionized gas .",

    "it is also difficult to resolve the weak  line from h@xmath3 s(2 ) 12.28@xmath10 m in low - resolution spectra .",
    "we quantified the amount of potential contamination to the  line strength in several ways : we fit our low - resolution spectra with and without the molecular hydrogen line ( the central wavelengths of both lines are very tightly constrained by pahfit ) , and found that the  line strength was only decreased by 15% ( that flux was attributed to h@xmath3 ) when both lines were included .",

    "the chiar & tielens curves agree well with the near - infrared extinction for the ism found by @xcite .",
    "thus , extinction correlates with the flux ratio of  to , and we can still find the relative level of extinction across 30@xmath0doradus  from the /  ratio , even though the absolute normalization is uncertain .",
    "we calculated the signal - to - noise of the ratio based on the rms variance of the individual maps of emission line strength , and removed all regions of the map where the signal - to - noise was less than 2 .",
    "we cropped away the parts of the map where an additive correction was made to the sl spectra ( see  [ finaladjustments ] ) , because this subset of the map encloses some spectra which have an unphysical plunge at the red edge of the sl2 module .",

    "the calculated ratio is not a strong function of temperature .",
    "the ridge is prominent in the [ ]   ratio or n@xmath25 map , and in fact the n@xmath25 map is quite similar to the 3 cm continuum in morphology .",
    "the density is elevated to the south of the bubble and r136 , in a region of relatively high excitation .",
    "variations in elemental abundances can in principle change the diagnostic ratios that we are using to measure physical conditions in the 30@xmath0doradus  nebula .",
    "previous studies have found very small internal abundance variations in 30@xmath0doradus  and other giant h@xmath6ii  regions .",

    "of more direct relevance to this work , @xcite found less than 0.01 dex dispersion of ne / h , s / h , and ar / h , using the high resolution gto spitzer spectra mentioned above .",
    "small scale abundance variations in h@xmath6ii  regions including 30@xmath0doradus   @xcite have been proposed to explain discrepancies between optical and infrared abundance determinations .",
    "we might hope to detect sub - parsec scale abundance variations in this dataset by using three infrared line ratios to solve simultaneously for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath37 . in practice , we find that the excitation variations can be adequately explained without abundance variations , which would be seen as residuals in our fitting of @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    ". the signal - to - noise especially in our argon line ratio is insufficient to detect abundance _ variations _ at the 0.1 dex level predicted by @xcite .",
    "overall , abundances in 30@xmath0doradus  are not particularly low : @xcite found",
    "ne / o , s / o , and ar / o ratios close to solar .",
    "@xcite found ne / h and ar / h of 12+log(x / h)=7.76@xmath90.02 and 6.32@xmath90.06 , respectively , within 0.25 dex of the range of solar values @xcite .",
    "they found s / h of 6.77@xmath90.03 , only about 0.3 dex sub - solar .",
    "we also find that on average , half - solar abundances result in modestly better agreement between the three infrared line ratios in our photoionization models than solar or 0.1-solar models .",
    "in practice , systematic effects such as the argon recombination rate have a larger effect on this agreement than the abundances @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , if photoionization is assumed to be the dominant physical process , the ionic line ratios depend on @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and to a lesser degree metallicity . if one assumes constant abundances and hardness or @xmath2 , then the line ratio maps in figure  [ ratiofig ] are maps of the ionization parameter @xmath1 , varying from log @xmath38 - 3 to log @xmath38 - 1.5 .",
    "a somewhat more sophisticated analysis is to solve for @xmath2 and @xmath1 simultaneously .",
    "we prepared a grid of photoionization models using cloudy @xcite as a 0-dimensional tool to solve for the ionization structure and line emissivities given a specified radiation field and ionization parameter ( we used the output of the first zone in each simulation ) .",
    "we explored different input spectra , including atlas @xcite , tlusty @xcite , costar ob and wolf - rayet atmospheres @xcite , and black - bodies . in the end",
    "we used a grid of tlusty atmospheres calculated at half - solar metallicity , extrapolated to hotter effective temperatures using black - body atmospheres to set the functional dependence of line ratios on effective temperature , and normalizing the ratios to those of the hottest tlusty models .",
    "( we found that adopting different stellar atmospheres primarily changes the line ratios by a constant multiplicative factor , and has very little effect on the functional dependence of the line ratios on effective temperature and ionization parameter . )",
    "we were not able to find freely available grids of more modern atmospheres ( e.g. wmbasic , costar ) at subsolar metallicity , but we performed careful comparisons of our modeling at solar metallicity to understand the systematic effects .",
    "if nebular abundances are set at solar levels in the photoionization models , and stellar atmospheres calculated at solar abundance are used for self - consistency , the derived ionization parameter @xmath1 decreases systematically by about 0.1 dex , and the derived radiation temperature increases systematically by 10% . at solar metallicity ,",
    "wmbasic atmospheres result in about a factor of two lower [ ] /[]ratio and a 50% lower [ ] /[]ratio .",
    "that would increase the derived ionization parameter in 30  doradus systematically by @xmath110.15 dex , and lower the derived radiation temperature by 510% .",
    "these effects have been explained in detail by other authors , especially @xcite .",
    "none of the changes in stellar atmospheres or metallicity that we explored would result in qualitative changes in our conclusions , merely small systematic shifts in derived parameters .",
    "we also varied the dust prescription in terms of abundance and grain size .",
    "neither had a strong effect on the line ratios as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , provided that @xmath1 was calculated locally , i.e. from integrating the diffuse ionizing field in the simulation above 1  ry , rather than assuming some geometry - dependent expression such as @xmath39 .",
    "figure  [ confidence ] shows typical behavior - each measured ratio defines a curve in @xmath40 space , but the lines have different slopes because the ionization potentials are spaced differently for the different atoms .",
    "this is equivalent to the nearly parallel arrows for @xmath1 and @xmath2 in @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "the region around the relatively isolated source at 5@xmath1738@xmath1856.5@xmath19 -69@xmath2004 to the north of the ridge is also highly excited , probably due to the local effects of that star ( source , figure  [ bwoverview ] ,  [ sources_text ] ) .",
    "we note two regions of high @xmath1 in particular .",
    "the most prominent is between the two parts of the ridge ( just south of source `` a '' ,  [ sources_text ] ) , where young stars may be locally ionizing the gas and beginning to lower the density and disperse the ridge ( see figure  [ maerckerfig ] for the location of protostars and the most energetic optically identified stars ) .",
    "alternately , the density is simply lower there and ionizing radiation can more easily leak out from the bubble region around r136 .",

    "aromatic dust emission features are of modest strength in the 30@xmath0doradus  region , concentrated in the arc - like two - lobed ridge coincident with co emission and partially encircling the central r136 cluster . detailed analysis of the dust content of the region from these features will follow in a subsequent publication , although the high average dust temperature is immediately obvious from the shape of the mips / sed spectrum .",
    "of the pure rotational lines of molecular hydrogen , only s(3)@xmath139.67@xmath10 m  is detected with any significance , peaking on the bright `` ridge '' that dominates the morphology of the region at many wavelengths ( see fig  [ atlinemaps3 ] ) .",
    "low - ionization atomic lines are present but not particularly strong : [ ] is detected in the outskirts of the mapped region , outside the region of strongest centimeter continuum ( highest emission measure ionized gas ) .",
    "[ ] @xmath1326.0@xmath10 m  is only tentatively detected in two locations .",
    "two hydrogen recombination lines hu@xmath29 ( 7 - 6 ) and hu@xmath31 ( 9 - 6 ) can be mapped over a large fraction of the observed area , and from these a relative measure of the extinction can be calculated .",
    "independent estimates of the extinction are calculated from fitting the strength of the 10@xmath10 m  silicate feature , and from the ratio of h@xmath29 to centimeter continuum . while none of the three extinction measures is extremely high signal - to - noise , the locations where all three show higher extinction should be quite secure - in particular three distinct locations in the west , southwest , and northeast , outside of the `` ridge '' ( fig  [ threecolorextinction ] ) .",
    "the strongest atomic or molecular features in the data cube are the moderate - ionization ionic lines [ ] @xmath137.0@xmath10 m , [ ] @xmath139.0@xmath10 m , [ ] @xmath1312.8@xmath10 m , [ ] @xmath1315.5@xmath10 m , [ ] @xmath1318.7@xmath10 m , [ ] @xmath1333.4@xmath10 m , and [ ] @xmath1310.5@xmath10 m .",
    "these lines are most sensitive to physical conditions in the ionized gas : the ionization parameter @xmath1 and hardness of the ionizing field , parametrized by the radiation temperature @xmath2 .",
    "we fit the neon and sulphur ratios with photoionization models to derive a 2-dimensional map of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we find that the excitation generally follows the `` ridge and bubble '' morphology , and that under the assumptions of pure photoionization , there are `` hot spots '' of hardened ionizing field in the east of the bubble and between the two lobes of the ridge ( corresponding to two molecular clouds ) .",
    "we also compare the line ratios to shock models and find poorer agreement with the data .",
    "in particular the nondetections of emission from more highly ionized species [ ] and [ ] suggest that photoionization dominates over collisional excitation by shocks .",
    "overall , the local effects of hot stars in 30@xmath0doradus  ( such as the single wr star on the eastern side of the bubble ) appear to dominate over any large - scale trend with distance from the central cluster r136 .",
    "our off - target background observations bracket the data set in time .",
    "we chose to take an average ( with minima and maxima trimmed ) of all the background records and subtract that from all of the data records .",
    "it was possible that the two sets of background records could be appreciably different , reflecting a gradual change in the instrument ( e.g. electronic drift ) , and that a linear interpolation of the two sets over time would be more appropriate as the background for each data record .",
    "indeed , the mean flux level of our background records tends to increase with time , varying by 8% between the first and last exposures .",
    "therefore , the average of the second set of background records has a higher mean flux level than the average of the first set .",
    "we tested three different background subtractions on several apertures from the sl1 module : using only the first background set , using only the second , and using the mean of the two sets .",
    "the difference between the resulting spectra was very small . specifically , the difference in continuum levels between typical spectra using the different background subtractions was on the order of 2% .",
    "for very low signal - to - noise spectra extracted from faint areas of the map , the continuum difference could reach 10% .",
    "we emphasize that , even then , the shape of the spectrum and the strength of the emission line features did not appreciably change .",
    "for the highest signal - to - noise spectra , the continuum difference was reduced to about 0.1% .",
    "we conclude that using the mean of all background records is adequate .",
    "the irs sl slit is approximately 3.6 arcseconds wide , and the ll is approximately 10.6 arcseconds wide ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* table 7.5 ) .",
    "some fraction of the instrument point - spread function ( psf ) falls outside of the slit , depending on wavelength .",
    "for example , the full width half max ( fwhm ) of the psf at 14.5@xmath10 m , at the upper wavelength range of the sl first order , is about 3.74 arcseconds ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "optimized for point sources , the spitzer space center pipeline adjusts the data for this loss of flux .",
    "however , in the case of a spatially uniform extended source , there is no net loss of flux .",
    "cubism can apply a slit loss correction factor which re - corrected the data to the original levels . in the case of 30@xmath0doradus ,",
    "an extended sources , we opted to do so .",
    "however , it is important to note that in some areas of the map , there are bright features which are neither point sources nor uniformly extended emission , which have some net loss of flux .",
    "the magnitude of this loss is at most 36% ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* slide 13 ) .",
    "this loss may be responsible for some of the mismatches we experienced between the flux densities in the four different modules at some points in the map .",
    "the wavelength range of the spectra needs to be trimmed .",
    "the full range of the irs in each of the four modules includes bins where the response is unreliable . in the ll modules , where the spectrum of 30@xmath0doradus   is generally smooth , the drop in response at the long - wave edge of the ll2 module and the increase in noise at the long - wave edge of the ll1 module are evident.we trimmed the ll modules based on these observations .",
    "the spectrum of 30@xmath0doradus  is more complex in the sl modules , however , with many emission lines and an unclear continuum . in order to determine the range of wavelengths which can be trusted in each sl module , we examined the irs low resolution   staring mode spectrum of @xmath29 lacertae , an a1 dwarf star whose smooth spectrum is well known . in each of the sl modules ,",
    "the spectrum departs from its smooth curve at the margins .",
    "we trimmed our sl spectra to the wavelengths where the irs spectrum of @xmath29 lac stayed faithful to the smooth curve .",
    "we also found , based on some spectra from 30@xmath0doradus , that the limit at the long - wave edge of the sl1 module based on the spectrum of @xmath29 lac was not conservative enough ; consequently , we decreased the trusted upper limit on wavelength for the sl1 .",
    "we could not use the spectrum of @xmath29 lac to determine the reliable wavelengths for the ll modules because the stellar spectrum has low signal - to - noise at such long wavelengths .    after extracting our spectra",
    ", we found that some of the sl spectra were suspiciously low , even negative for some counts .",
    "this may be a problem with background subtraction , and thus requires an additive correction .",
    "we raised both sl modules by the additive quantity necessary to make the floor of the sl2 spectrum ( the median of the five lowest counts ) non - negative .",
    "over 72% of the map , this correction was unnecessary . over the remaining 28% , mainly in areas of low signal",
    ", the sl spectrum was raised by a mean level of 5.5 mjy / sr , with standard deviation of 6.5 mjy / sr . for comparison ,",
    "the mean level of the background spectrum in the sl is 3.2 mjy / sr and the mean level of the background - subtracted sl spectrum averaged across a large region of 30 doradus is about 100 mjy / sr .",
    "the different modules of an irs spectrum do not always match up well in flux density .",
    "the mismatches between the sl1 and sl2 modules , and between the ll1 and ll2 modules , were rarely serious .",
    "however , we noticed more consistent mismatches between the sl1 and ll2 modules .",
    "the primary cause is probably that the emission in the 30@xmath0doradus  region is often best characterized as neither a point source nor as a uniform extended source , but instead as something in between .",
    "we have treated it as a uniform extended source ( see  [ fluxcal ] ) , likely losing some flux .",
    "this would call for a multiplicative correction .",
    "we found logarithmic fits to the continuum emission close to the junction in each module and multiplied the sl spectra by the ratio of the fits in the overlapping wavelengths .",
    "the mean value of the multiplicative correction is 1.2 with a standard deviation of 1.2 .",
    "[ appendix2 ]    in order to check our work on reducing the spectral map , we compared our spectra , taken with the low resolution  modules of the irs in mapping mode , to spectra of several areas of the 30@xmath0doradus  nebula taken with both the low and high resolution  modules of the irs , in staring mode ( private correspondence and * ? ? ?",
    "these spectra will henceforth be referred to as the gto spectra .",
    "the apertures they span are displayed in green in figure [ irscoverage ] . by selecting the subsets of our map that coincide with the gto apertures",
    ", we can produce spectra which should be consistent with theirs .",
    "we applied pahfit , the same fitting algorithm that we use on our spectral map , to the gto spectra .",
    "we made some adjustments to pahfit to allow for the much higher spectral resolution in the gto spectra redward of about 10@xmath10 m , where there is coverage from the high resolution  modules .    in figure",
    "[ brandlcomp_total ] , the fitted spectra from two of these apertures are shown .",
    "the overall agreement in the shape of the spectrum is clear , with a notable exception in the continuum from 20 to 32@xmath10m(likely the result of nonlinearity in the short - low detector response ) . in the upper panel , taken from an aperture toward the south of the 30@xmath0doradus  nebula , at",
    "around 05@xmath1738@xmath1850@xmath19 -69@xmath2006 , where the continuum emission at long wavelengths is relatively faint , the agreement between the gto spectrum and ours is close , but the effect starts to become noticeable at higher flux densities . in the lower panel , taken from a brighter part of the 30@xmath0doradus  nebula at 05@xmath1738@xmath1848@xmath19 -69@xmath2004 where the falling response in the ll1 is more severe , the difference between the gto spectrum and ours is larger .",
    "we are most concerned with whether we can obtain the same emission line strengths by fitting the gto spectra in the same manner as ours .",
    "figures [ brandlcomp_total ] and [ brandlcomp_singleline ] show that the pahs have similar profiles , while the unresolved atomic lines are narrower with higher central intensities in the long - wave , high resolution   part of the gto spectra .",
    "the integrated strengths of several of the long - wave emission lines of interest are plotted in figure [ brandlcomp_linestrengths ] , for twelve gto spectra and the corresponding apertures in our map .",
    "perfect agreement falls along the line of unity .",
    "the fits to the pah complex at 11.3@xmath10 m  agree well only at low strength .",
    "this may be because of detailed fine structure that appears in the pah complex at high resolution .",
    "in the low resolution  spectrum , only a broad feature at 11.3@xmath10 m , with a shoulder at 11.0@xmath10 m , is apparent .",
    "a drude profile is sufficient to fit that , and a more complex fitting profile would not be appropriate because of the lack of resolution . in high resolution  such as in the gto spectra , the shoulder at 11.0@xmath10",
    "m  resolves into a completely separate feature ( see figure [ brandlcomp_singleline ] ) , possibly another pah feature .",
    "this might also be the paschen-@xmath31 hi recombination line , although so significantly shifted from its rest wavelength at 10.95@xmath10 m as to make such an identification questionable .",
    "the main pah feature at 11.3@xmath10 m  displays a different profile that would require a more complex fitting algorithm .",
    "thus , we are not concerned about this disparity .",
    "the conclusion is that pahfit is adequate for fitting pahs at low resolution , but may not sufficiently describe the same features at high resolution   not surprising , as the list of features used in pahfit was empirically tuned using low resolution  spectra .",
    "a systematic disparity is evident in the comparison of the  fitted line strength . upon closer examination",
    ", two factors surfaced .",
    "both support the trend that the fitted line strength at low resolution  is higher than the line strength at high resolution .",
    "first , the fainter molecular hydrogen line , h@xmath3 s(2 ) @xmath1312.28@xmath10 m , is resolved in high resolution .",
    "the fit to the high resolution  line therefore does not include any of the flux from the molecular hydrogen line .",
    "meanwhile , in the low resolution  spectrum , the flux from both lines contributes to the same broad feature .",
    "we are confident that  contributes most of the flux we see in low resolution , in part because the line center more closely coincides with 12.37 than with 12.28@xmath10 m , and in part because , as we can see in the high resolution  spectra , the  line is equal to or stronger than h@xmath3 s(2 )  in all of the areas of our map covered by the high resolution  spectra .",
    "however , the flux of both emission lines is contributing to the low - resolution fit , and so to some extent , our fits to the line strength of the  line are overestimated . quantitative comparison between high- and low - resolution spectra and between",
    "fits with and without the molecular hydrogen line show that the contamination of the  line strength is at most @xmath1120% ( see  [ extinction ] ) .",
    "this effect is weakest in the parts of 30@xmath0doradus  dominated by ionized gas that are the focus of this paper , but should be kept in mind for analysis of the outer parts of the region and pdr physics in future papers .",
    "the second factor that contributes to the disparity seen in the second panel of figure [ brandlcomp_linestrengths ] is the pah feature at 12.6@xmath10 m .",
    "as discussed above in the context of the pah complex at 11.3@xmath10 m , the fitting package pahfit is intended for the relatively smooth features seen in low resolution , and does not handle the complex morphology of pahs seen at high resolution  as well . in the case of the pah at 12.6@xmath10 m , its line strength in the high resolution  fit is generally overestimated .",
    "its broad wings thus lead the strength of the  line to be underestimated in the high resolution  fit .",
    "the slight overestimation of the line in the low resolution  spectrum and the slight underestimation of the line in the high resolution  spectrum both contribute to the disparity .",
    "the results for the forbidden neon lines , as for most of the stronger lines , show a tighter correlation .",
    "the close agreement in the fits to the low and high resolution  spectra for the weaker [ ] @xmath1312.8@xmath10 m  is particularly encouraging because one of our concerns in interpreting the neon ratio was the possible entanglement of the [ ]  atomic emission line with the above - mentioned pah at 12.6@xmath10 m . in the high resolution  spectrum ,",
    "the pah ( with its often - unusual shape ) and the atomic line are resolved . as in the case of the  line",
    ", the strength of the [ ]  line may be slightly underestimated because of the poor , overestimated fit to the pah at 12.6@xmath10 m .",
    "the close agreement between the low resolution  and high resolution  fit , across almost all of the twelve apertures , regardless of pah strength in each aperture , indicates that there are no systematic errors to the low resolution  fit that do not also appear in the high resolution  fit .",
    "thus , our results may share the slight bias toward underestimating the [ ]  strength , but we are generally able to decompose [ ]  and the pah at 12.6@xmath10 m   despite the lack of spectral resolution .    finally , the correlation for the fitted line strength of [ ] @xmath1315.5@xmath10 m  is similarly good , with the exception of two apertures where the high resolution   fitted line strength is significantly higher than the low resolution  fitted line strength .",
    "these two apertures ( displayed with squares rather than diamonds in figure [ brandlcomp_linestrengths ] ) are located in a small region of the map that exemplifies the extreme of the trend shown in figure [ brandlcomp_total ] , where the response in the ll1 module falls until the module finally saturates . in these cases ,",
    "our fit to the continuum with thermal dust components is not very successful .",
    "the fitted continuum is dragged down in the area from 20 to 32@xmath10 m , which forces it up in the region of 15@xmath10 m .",
    "this causes our estimation of the strength of [ ]  to be underestimated .",
    "for these two anomalous apertures , we conducted a test by removing the faulty ll1 spectrum and fitting only the remaining spectrum , to get a better estimation of continuum in the region of [ ] . this increased the fitted strength of [ ] , though not enough to get it to agree with the value we obtained by fitting the high - resolution spectrum .    the effect of long - wave line strengths being underestimated in our low resolution   spectra compared to the high resolution  gto spectra is seen for [ ] @xmath1315.5@xmath10 m  and [ ] @xmath1333.4@xmath10 m  in some areas of the map .",
    "empirically , the line strengths of [ ] @xmath1312.8@xmath10 m  and [ ] @xmath1318.7@xmath10 m  appear to be unaffected , as shown by their close agreement with the gto spectra .",
    "it is crucial to note that this effect is restricted to the small areas of the map where we can see falling response in the ll1 module , as drawn in figure  [ saturationmap ] . in that localized area",
    ", we can expect our values of [ ]  and [ ] @xmath1333.4@xmath10 m  to be underestimated relative to the gto results by perhaps 30% , as shown in figure [ brandlcomp_linestrengths ] ( the effect is very similar for [ ] @xmath1333.4@xmath10 m ) .",
    "outside these small areas of the map , the agreement between our spectra and the high - resolution gto spectra is excellent for these two emission lines .",
    "this work benefited greatly from the generous contributions of several individuals : gary ferland and his students for creating the cloudy photoionization code , john raymond for giving us a copy of his shock code , john dickel and jasmina lazendic for giving us their calibrated centimeter synthesis images , and sean points for giving us calibrated mcels h@xmath29 data .",

    "<S> we present a mid - infrared spectroscopic data cube of the central part of 30@xmath0doradus , observed with _ spitzer _ </S>",
    "<S> s irs and mips / sed mode . </S>",
    "<S> aromatic dust emission features and emission lines from molecular and atomic hydrogen are detected but not particularly strong . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant spectral features are emission lines from moderately ionized species of argon , neon , and sulphur , which are used to determine the physical conditions in the ionized gas . </S>",
    "<S> the ionized gas excitation shows strong variations on parsec scales , some of which can plausibly be associated with individual hot stars . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the ionic line strengths with photoionization and shock models , and find that photoionization dominates in the region . </S>",
    "<S> the ionization parameter @xmath1 traces the rim of the central bubble , as well as highlighting isolated sources of ionization , and at least one quiescent clump . </S>",
    "<S> the hardness of the ionizing radiation field @xmath2 reveals several `` hot spots '' that are either the result of individual very hot stars or trace the propagation of the diffuse ionizing field through the surrounding neutral cloud . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with other measurements of giant regions , log(@xmath1 ) ranges between -3 and -0.75 , and @xmath2 between 30000 and 85000k . </S>"
