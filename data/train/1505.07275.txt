    "experimental measurements of such resistances ( [ eq : def - opory ] ) can be done , treating one of the electrodes as a voltage probe . in our three - terminal device with the quantum dot we can assume either the metallic or superconducting electrode to be floating .",
    "we now briefly discuss both such options .",
    "we assume that the superconducting lead @xmath1 is grounded and treat the metallic electrode ( say @xmath21 ) as a voltage probe .",

    "let us notice , that a sign of the non - local resistance @xmath63 depends on a competition between the normal electron transfer ( et ) and the crossed andreev reflections ( car ) . the local resistance @xmath110 is in turn a sum of the non - local resistances @xmath111 and @xmath63 . for the configuration , where the other ( @xmath0 ) metallic lead is",

    "imply @xmath115 we notice some analogy between the resistances ( [ eq : s4]-[eq : s6 ] ) and the previous expressions ( [ eq : s1]-[eq : s3 ] ) .",
    "the significant difference appears between the non - local resistances @xmath63 ( [ eq : s2 ] ) and @xmath116 ( [ eq : s5 ] ) .",
    "because of a minus sign in ( [ eq : s2 ] ) the former configuration seems to be more sensitive for probing the local versus non - local transport properties .",
    "measurements of the local / non - local resistances provide information about the competition between various tunneling processes .",
    "similar information can be also deduced about the linear coefficients @xmath54 .",
    "let s combine the results obtained for @xmath21 ( or @xmath0 ) and @xmath1 floating electrodes .",
    "we have three independent equations , but we have to determine four coefficients @xmath117 in general , we thus can not obtain a complete information about all conductances from the separate measurements of the currents and voltages .",
    "this situation differs from the case when the quantum dot is coupled to all three normal electrodes , where electrical transport can be characterized only by three conductances .",
    "fortunately , for the case with asymmetric couplings @xmath118 the measurements can unambiguously determine the partial conductances @xmath119 some inconvenience is related to the fact the tunneling rates @xmath120 , @xmath121 must be measured as well .",
    "the non - linear effects are of vital importance in the transport studies of nanostructures _",
    "inter alia _ due to limited screening of charge and access to far from equilibrium states of the system .",
    "non - equilibrium transport driven by the voltage @xmath67 ( beyond the linear regime ) in nanostructures is accompanied by substantial redistribution of the charges .",
    "this affects the occupancy of the quantum dot and leads to piling up of the charge in the electrodes . by long range coulomb interactions the charge redistributions backreact on the transport properties .",
    "we shall address this effect in some detail .",
    "let s note that we are considering here the charge transport driven by voltages safely below the superconducting gap @xmath122 ( practically we assume @xmath123 ) .",
    "nevertheless , even at such small voltage ( of the order of a few @xmath120 ) the pile - up of electric charges in the electrodes and the dot affects the transport by shifting the chemical potentials and screening the charge on the dot .",
    "this is taken into account in the hamiltonian ( [ eq - ham ] ) by the term @xmath124 .",
    "the effect has been considered first in mesoscopic normal systems by altshuler and khmelnitskii  @xcite , bttiker with coworkers  @xcite and others  @xcite .",
    "it has been also explored in the metal - superconductor ( two - terminal ) junctions  @xcite . here",
    "we follow [ ] , assuming that the long range interactions modify the on - dot energy @xmath10 changing it to @xmath125 . in equilibrium",
    "the potential @xmath69 has a constant value , which we denote by @xmath81 . in the presence of the applied voltages @xmath126 ( where @xmath127 ) the deviations @xmath128 , in the lowest order , would be a linear function @xmath129 where @xmath130 denotes the derivative with all voltages set to zero and the gauge invariance implies that @xmath131  @xcite .",
    "our treatment here relies on the mean field like approximation . in the three terminal device with the quantum dot",

    "during the flow of carriers the deviations of @xmath133 from the equilibrium value @xmath81 can be related to the change of the charge carriers @xmath134 by the capacitance equation @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is capacity of the system .",
    "the charge density as well as all currents depend on the voltages and @xmath133 .",

    "<S> we predict strong non - local effects in the three - terminal hybrid device , comprising the quantum dot embedded between two conducting leads and third superconducting reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> they result from competition between the ballistic electron transfer and the crossed andreev scattering . the non - local voltage induced in response to the driving current changes the magnitude and sign upon varying the gate potential and/or coupling to the superconducting lead . </S>",
    "<S> such effect is robust both in the linear and non - linear regimes , where the screening and the long - range interactions play significant role . </S>",
    "<S> this novel subgap transport is provided by the shiba states and can be contrasted with much weaker non - local effects observed hitherto in the three - terminal planar junctions .    </S>",
    "<S> multi - terminal systems enable measurements of both the local and the nonlocal voltages / currents between selected electrode pairs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the non - local transport of charge  @xcite , heat  @xcite and spin  @xcite via hybrid devices consisting of the normal and superconducting reservoirs are currently of interest for the basic research and innovative applications . </S>",
    "<S> electrons traversing metal - superconductor interface are glued into the cooper pairs , and conversely , the cooper pairs are split into the individual electrons  @xcite . in both processes there emerge the entangled carriers , leading to nonlocal correlations . </S>",
    "<S> these effects can be amplified by inserting the quantum dots between the reservoirs  @xcite . in this regard , </S>",
    "<S> the three - terminal structures are especially useful , because they allow for efficient splitting of the cooper pairs  @xcite , give rise to spin filtering  @xcite , generate the correlated spin currents  @xcite , separate the charge from heat currents  @xcite , enable realization of the exotic weyl or majorana - type quasi - particles  @xcite , etc .    </S>",
    "<S> very spectacular non - local effects are provided by the crossed andreev reflections ( car ) , operating in a subgap regime . </S>",
    "<S> the driving current applied to one side of the multi - terminal junction can yield either positive or negative nonlocal voltage response at the other interface , depending on a competition between the ballistic electron transfer ( et ) and the car processes . </S>",
    "<S> such changeover has been observed in three - terminal planar junctions  @xcite , using a piece of superconducting sample sandwiched between two conducting ( normal or magnetic ) electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> the induced non - local conductance , however , was much weaker from the local one in agreement with theoretical predictions  @xcite .     and @xmath0 ) , superconducting reservoir ( @xmath1 ) and the quantum dot ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the driving current in the @xmath3 loop induces the non - local voltage response of the floating @xmath0 electrode . ]    here we propose a different configuration , where the quantum dot is built into the three - terminal hybrid as sketched in fig .   </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> proximity effect converts the quantum dot into , a kind of , superconducting grain and its subgap spectrum develops the , so called , andreev or shiba bound states  @xcite , which substantially enhance the non - local transport . </S>",
    "<S> we show that effective non - local conductance can be comparable to the local one and can change sign from the positive to negative values by increasing the coupling @xmath4 to superconducting electrode or by appropriate tuning of the gate potential . </S>",
    "<S> the gate potential is also controlling symmetry of this effect . </S>",
    "<S> experimental tests of such effects should be feasible using the three - terminal architecture with such quantum dots as the carbon nano - tubes  @xcite , semiconducting nano - wires  @xcite or self - assembled inas islands  @xcite . </S>"
