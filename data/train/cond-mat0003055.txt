    "self - assembled , stranski - krastanow ( sk ) grown semiconductor quantum dots have recently received considerable attention as they exhibit a rich spectrum of phenomena including quantum - confinement@xcite , exchange - splittings@xcite , coulomb charging / blockade@xcite and multi - exciton transitions@xcite . over the past few years a considerable number of high quality measurements of the electronic level stucture of these dot systems have been performed , using photoluminescence ( pl)@xcite , photoluminescence luminescence excitation ( ple)@xcite , capacitance@xcite and far infra red ( fir ) spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "these measurements have been able to determine the electronic level structure to relatively high precision . in parallel with these measurements ,",
    "several groups have also attempted to measure the geometry and composition of these dots@xcite .",
    "so far , however , these measurements have failed to provide details of the shape , size , inhomogeneous strain and alloying profiles to a similar level of accuracy to that in which the electronic structure has been determined . as a result , the size of the dots were often used as adjustable parameters in models that fit experimental spectra .",
    "for example , using a single - band effective mass model , dekel _ et .",
    "al_@xcite defined an `` effective shape '' ( cuboid ) and `` effective dimension '' that reproduced the measured excitonic transitions .",
    "similar `` parabolic dot '' models have been assumed by hawrylak _ et .",
    "al_@xcite .",
    "the accuracy of single - band and multi - band effective mass methods was recently examined in a series of papers @xcite . in these works , the shape , size and composition of nanostructures were arbitrarily fixed , and the electronic structure was evaluated by successively improving the basis set , starting from single - band methods ( effective - mass ) , going to six and eight band methods ( k.p ) , and finally , using a converged , multi - band approach ( plane - wave pseudopotentials ) .",
    "it was found that conventional effective - mass and k.p methods can sometimes significantly misrepresent the fully converged results even when the shape , size and composition was given .",
    "the observed discrepancies were both quantitative ( such as band gap values , level spacings , coulomb energies ) and qualitative ( absence of polarization anisotropy in square based pyramidal dots@xcite , missing energy levels@xcite ) .",
    "as a result of these limitations these methods may not offer a reliable bridge between the electronic structure and atomic structure .    in this paper , we offer a bridge between recent measurements of the _ electronic structure _ and measurements of the _ atomic structure _ of the dots using accurate theoretical modeling .",
    "modeling can determine if the calculated electronic structure resulting from an assumed shape , size , strain and alloying profiles agrees with the measured electronic structure or not . a theory that can perform such a `` bridging function",
    "'' must be accurate and reliable .",
    "the pseudopotential approach to this problem qualifies , in that any discrepancy between the predicted and measured electronic properties can be attributed to incorrectly assumed shape , size or alloying profile .",
    "we have studied a range of shapes , sizes and alloy profiles and find that a lens - shaped inas dot with an inhomogeneous ga alloying profile is in closest agreement with current measurements . in the following sections we attempt to provide a consistent theoretical interpretation of numerous spectroscopic properties of inas / gaas dots .",
    "we aim to calculate the energy associated with various electronic excitations in inas / gaas quantum dots .",
    "these energies can be expressed as total energy differences and require four stages of calculation :    \\(i ) _ assume the shape , size and composition and compute the equilibrium displacements : _ we first construct a supercell containing both the quantum dot and surrounding gaas barrier material .",
    "the shape , size and composition profile are taken as input and subsequently refined .",
    "sufficient gaas barrier is used , so that when periodic boundary conditions are applied to the system , the electronic and strain interactions between dots in neighboring cells is negligible .",
    "the atomic positions within the supercell are then relaxed by minimizing the strain energy described by an atomistic force field@xcite including bond bending , bond stretching and bond bending - bond stretching interactions ( see section  [ vff ] ) .",
    "an atomic force field is similar to continuum elasticity approaches@xcite in that both methods are based on the elastic constants , @xmath0 , of the underlying bulk materials .",
    "however , atomistic approaches are superior to continuum methods in two ways , ( a ) they can contain anharmonic effects , and ( b ) they capture the correct point group symmetry , e.g. the point group symmetry of a square based , zinc blende pyramidal dot is @xmath1 , since the [ 110 ] and [ 1@xmath20 ] directions are inequivalent while continuum methods@xcite , find @xmath3 . more details of the atomistic relaxation are given in section  [ vff ] .",
    "\\(ii ) _ setup and solve the pseudopotential single - particle equation : _ a single - particle schrdinger equation is set up at the relaxed atomic positions , @xmath4 @xmath5 the potential for the system is written as a sum of strain - dependent , screened atomic pseudopotentials , @xmath6 , that are fit to bulk properties extracted from experiment and first - principles calculations ( see section  [ sp ] ) .",
    "the schrdinger equation is solved by expanding @xmath7 in a linear combination of bulk states , @xmath8 , from bands , @xmath9 , and k - points , @xmath10 , @xmath11 taken at a few strain values . the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ ham ] ) and ( [ lcbb_basis ] ) provides the level structure and dipole transition matrix elements .",
    "more details on the solution of the schrdinger equation are given in section  [ lcbb ] .",
    "\\(iii ) _ calculate the screened , inter - particle many - body interactions : _ the calculated single particle wavefunctions are used to compute the electron - electron , electron - hole and hole - hole direct , @xmath12 , and exchange @xmath13 coulomb energies ( see section  [ coulomb ] ) .",
    "\\(iv ) _ calculate excitation energies as differences in total , many particle energies : _ for example , the difference between the total energy @xmath14 $ ] of a dot with a hole in level @xmath15 and an electron in level @xmath16 and the total energy @xmath17 $ ] of the unexcited dot is @xmath18-e_{00}[h_0 ^ 0e_0 ^ 0 ] & = & \\left(\\epsilon_{e_0 } - \\epsilon_{h_0}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & - & j_{e_0h_0 } + 2k_{e_0h_0}\\delta_{s,0}\\;\\;\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ( in the absence of spin - orbit coupling ) @xmath19 for triplet states , and 0 for singlet states .",
    "analagous expressions exist for electron - addition experiments ( see section  [ coulomb ] ) .",
    "the main approximations involved in our method are : ( a ) the fit of the pseudopotential to the experimental data of bulk materials is never perfect ( see table  [ fit_table ] ) and ( b ) we neglect self - consistent iterations in that we assume that the screened pseudopotential drawn from a bulk calculation is appropriate for the dot .",
    "our numerical convergence parameters are ( i ) the size of the gaas barrier separating periodic images of the dots , and ( ii ) the number of bulk wavefunctions used in the lcbb expansion of the wavefunctions . to examine the effects of these approximations and convergences on the ultimate level of accuracy that can be obtained with our methodology we have first applied these methods to an ingaas / gaas quantum well(see section  [ qw_test ] ) , where experimental measurements of the shape , size , composition and transition energies are more established ( see section  [ qw_test ] ) .",

    "the heavier effective mass of the holes , results in less kinetic energy associated with confinement at the top of the dot and hence the holes move up more than electrons on the introduction of ga , producing the correct dipole .",
    "however , when we repeat these calculations in the more sophisticated , multi - band lcbb basis used here , we find significant heavy hole - light hole mixing in the @xmath15 state , which acts to reduce the above effect and produce a smaller dipole of @xmath1221  , in contradiction with experiment ( + 4  ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that in a more complete calculation the shape and alloy profile postulated by fry _ et .",
    "al._@xcite does not produce the observed excitonic dipole .",
    "in table  [ results_table ] we show the results of our calculations for pure inas , lens shaped quantum dots embedded within gaas [ column ( a ) ] .",
    "table  [ results_table ] also shows the experimentally measured splittings of the electron levels , the electron - electron and electron - hole coulomb energies , the magnetic field dependence and the excitonic band gap measured in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the agreement between the measured energy level spacings , coulomb energies and magnetic field response with our theoretical lens shaped model is generally good .",
    "both the model and experiment find ( i ) a large spacing , @xmath190 , ( @xmath12250 - 60 mev ) between the @xmath104-like @xmath16 state and the @xmath176-like @xmath143 state , ( ii ) a small spacing , @xmath187 , ( @xmath1223 mev ) between the two @xmath176-like @xmath143 and @xmath144 states and ( iii ) a large spacing ( @xmath12255 mev ) between the @xmath176-like @xmath144 state and the @xmath188-like @xmath145 state .",
    "these electron level spacings are similar to those found for pyramidal quantum dots@xcite ( see table  [ results_table ] ) . however , in the pyramidal dot , the spacings of the two @xmath176-like and @xmath188-like states , @xmath261 , is larger ( 26 and 23 mev ) as a result of the lower c@xmath262 symmetry of a zincblende pyramid .",
    "both the model and experiment also find similar values for the coulomb energies , @xmath263 and @xmath264 ( @xmath12225 mev ) .",
    "the calculated hole binding energy of @xmath265 mev is in good agreement with those of berryman _ et .",
    "al._@xcite ( @xmath122240 mev ) and itskevich _ et .",
    "al._@xcite ( @xmath122250 mev ) .",
    "our calculated electron binding energies , @xmath266 , are considerable larger ( 271 mev ) than those of berryman _ et . al._@xcite ( @xmath12260 mev ) and tang _ et .",
    "al._@xcite ( @xmath12280 mev ) .",
    "we attribute this difference to the larger size of our dots .",
    "the assumption of a pure inas dot also affects the comparison .",
    "the agreement improves when we include ga in our dots ( see section  [ diffusion ] ) .",
    "the calculated electron - electron and electron - hole coulomb energies are in reasonable agreement with those extracted from refs.@xcite and @xcite . for the integrals @xmath267 and @xmath268",
    "we calculate values of 31 , 25 , 25 and 37 respectively , compared to measured values of 23 , 24 , 18 and 33.3 mev    the calculated polarization anisotropies , @xmath169 , for the @xmath210 recombination in lens and pyramidal shaped , pure inas dots are @xmath209 and 1.2 respectively . a future measurement of this anisotropy ratio for lens shaped dots would provide an important piece of evidence for determining the detailed geometry of the dots .",
    "in the lens shaped dot we find a difference in the average positions of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 states , @xmath259 , of around 1  .",
    "this is smaller than the value we calculate for a pyramidal quantum dot , where we find the hole approximately 3.1   higher than the electron .    in summary , the assumed lens shaped geometry , with a pure inas composition produces a good agreement with measured level splitting , coulomb energies and magnetic field dependence .",
    "a closer inspection of the remaining differences reveals that the calculations systematically _ overestimate _ the splittings between the single particle electron levels ( @xmath190 : 65 _ vs. _ 50 mev , @xmath191:68 _ vs. _ 48 mev ) and _ underestimates _ the excitonic band gap ( 1032 _ vs. _ 1098 mev ) .",
    "focusing on the lens shape only , we examine the effect of changing the height and base of the assumed geometry .",
    "calculations were performed on similar lens shaped , pure inas dots where ( i ) the base of the dot was increased from 252 to 275 , while keeping the height fixed at 35 , [ column ( b ) ] and ( ii ) the height of the dot was decreased from 35 to 25 , while keeping the base fixed at 252 , [ column ( c ) ] .",
    "it shows that decreasing the height of the dot increases the quantum confinement and hence increases the splittings of the electron and hole levels ( @xmath190 : from 65 to 69 mev and @xmath269 : from 8 to 16 mev ) . decreasing the height of the dot also acts to increase the excitonic band gap from 1032 to 1131 mev by pushing up the energy of the electron levels and pushing down the hole levels .",
    "conversely , increasing the base of the dot decreases both the splittings of the single particle levels ( @xmath190 : from 66 to 61 mev ) and the band gap ( 1032 to 1016 ev ) .",
    "these small changes in the geometry of the lens shaped dot have only a small effect on electronic properties that depend on the shape of the wavefunctions .",
    "the electron - electron and electron - hole coulomb energies remain relatively unchanged , the magnetic field induced splitting remain at 20 mev , the polarization anisotropy , @xmath169 , remains close to 1.0 and the excitonic dipole , @xmath259 , remains negligible . in summary , reducing either the height or the base of the dot increases quantum confinement effects and hence increases energy spacings and band gaps , while not significantly effecting the shape wavefunctions .",
    "we next investigate the effect of changing the composition of the quantum dots , while keeping the geometry fixed .",
    "there have recently been several experiments@xcite suggesting that a significant amount of ga diffuses into the nominally pure inas quantum dots during the growth process .",
    "we investigate two possible mechanisms for this ga in - diffusion ; ( i ) ga diffuses into the dots during the growth process from all directions producing a dot with a uniform ga composition ga@xmath270in@xmath271as , and ( ii ) ga diffuses up from the substrate , as suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "to investigate the effects of these two methods of ga in - diffusion on the electronic structure of the dots , we compare pure inas dots embedded in gaas with ga@xmath270in@xmath271as , random alloy dots embedded in gaas , where the ga composition , @xmath272 , ( i ) is fixed at 0.15 , [ column ( d ) ] and ( ii ) varies linearly from 0.3 at the base to 0 at the top of the dot , [ column ( e ) ] .",
    "the electronic structure of these dots is compared in table  [ results_table ] .",
    "it shows that increasing the amount of ga in the dots acts to decrease the electron level spacings ( @xmath190 : from 65 to 58 and 64 mev for @xmath273 and @xmath274 to @xmath275 respectively ) .",
    "it also acts to increase the excitonic band gap from 1032 to 1080 and 1125 mev respectively .",
    "the electron binding energy , @xmath193 , is decreased by the in diffusion of ga ( from 271 to 209 and 192 mev ) , while the hole binding energy , @xmath243 , is relatively unaffected .",
    "this significant decrease in the electron binding energy considerably improves the agreement with experiments on other dot geometries@xcite .    as with changing the size of the dots , we find that ga in - diffusion has only a small effects on properties that depend on the shape of the wavefunctions .",
    "the calculated electron - electron and electron - hole coulomb energies are almost unchanged , while the average separation of the electron and hole , @xmath259 , increases from 0.16 to to 0.5 and 1.2   and the polarization ratio , @xmath169 , and magnetic field response are also unchanged .",
    "table  [ results_table ] shows that the dominant contribution to the increase in the excitonic band gap and reduction in electron binding energy , results mostly from an increase in the energy of the _ electron _ levels as the ga composition is increased .",
    "this can be understood by considering the electronic properties of the bulk ga@xmath270in@xmath271as random alloy .",
    "the unstrained valence band offset between gaas and inas is @xmath122 50 mev@xcite , while the conduction band offset in @xmath122 1100 mev and hence changing the ga composition , @xmath272 , has a large effect on the energy of the electron states and only a small effect on the hole states . in summary , the effect of ga in - diffusion is to reduce the spacing of the electron levels while significantly increasing their energy and hence increasing the band gap .",
    "we find that only the average ga composition in the dots is important to their electronic properties .",
    "whether this ga is uniformly or linearly distributed throughout the dots has a negligible effect .",
    "note , in ref.@xcite it is suggested that a linear composition profile is required to produce an excitonic dipole moment in agreement with that measured by stark experiments . for the lens shaped geometry discussed here there have so far been no such measurements of the dipole , but",
    "our calculations suggest that it should be small ( @xmath1221 ) .",
    "the effects of changing the _ geometry _ of the lens shaped , pure inas dots on the single particle energy levels can be qualitatively understood from single band , effective mass arguments .",
    "these predict that decreasing any dimension of the dot , increases the quantum confinement and hence the energy level spacings and the single particle band gap will increase . note that as the dominant quantum confinement in these systems arises from the vertical confinement of the electron and hole wavefunctions , changing the height has a stronger effect of the energy levels than changing the base . in this case decreasing the height by 10  has a much stronger effect on the energy spacings and on the band gap than increasing the base by 23 .    as increasing(decreasing ) the dimensions of the dot acts to decrease(increase )",
    "both the level spacings and the gap , it is clear that changing the dot geometry alone will not significantly improve the agreement with experiment as this requires a simultaneous _ decrease _ in the energy level splittings and _ increase _ in the band gap .",
    "however , ga in - diffusion into the dots acts to _ increase _ the band gap of the dot while decreasing the energy level spacings .",
    "table  [ results_table ] shows that adopting a geometry with a base of 275    and a height of 35 and a uniform ga composition of ga@xmath276in@xmath277as produces the best fit to the measurements in refs.@xcite and @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", our results strongly suggest that to obtain very accurate agreement between theoretical models and experimental measurements for lens shaped quantum dots , one needs to adopt a model of the quantum dot that includes some ga in - diffusion within the quantum dot .",
    "when ga in - diffusion is included , we obtain an excellent agreement between state of the art multi - band pseudopotential calculations and experiments for a wide range of electronic properties .",
    "we are able to predict most observable properties to an accuracy of @xmath278 mev , which is sufficient to make predictions of both the geometry and composition of the dot samples .",
