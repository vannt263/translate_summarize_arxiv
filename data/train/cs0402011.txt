    "recently there has been a considerable effort to understand the topology of complex networks  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are complex networks obtained from evolving mechanisms , like the internet or the world wide web , as they are so influential in our daily life .",
    "the degree @xmath0 of a node , is the number of links which have the node as an end - point , or equivalently , the number of nearest neighbors of the node .",
    "the statistical distribution of the degree @xmath1 , gives important information of the global properties of a network and can be used to characterize different network topologies .",
    "the internet has been studied in detail  @xcite since the measured data  @xcite became available .",
    "now , it is well known that the internet can be represented as a _ scale - free _ ( sf )",
    "network , where the degree distribution is a power law @xmath2 .",
    "the exponent @xmath3 of the internet at the autonomous systems ( as ) level is approximately @xmath4 ( see fig.[fig : degree ] and fig.[fig : degreecum ] ) .",
    "barabsi and albert ( ba )  @xcite showed that it is possible to grow a network with a power - law degree distribution by using a preferential - growth mechanism : starting with a small random network , the system grows by attaching a new node with @xmath5 links to @xmath5 different `` old '' nodes that are already present in the system ( @xmath6 to obtain internet - like networks ) ; the attachment is preferential because the probability that a new node will connect to node @xmath7 , with degree @xmath8 , is @xmath9 the ba model generates networks with the power - law exponent @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "based on the ba model , a number of evolving network models  @xcite have been introduced to obtain degree distributions with other power - law exponents .",
    "some of these new models have been used to model the internet . however , a network model based solely on the reproduction of the power - law exponent of the degree distribution has its limitations , as it will not describe the internet hierarchical structure  @xcite . in the next section",
    "we investigate two properties of the internet which were not accurately modeled by the existing models , namely the rich - club connectivity  @xcite among high - degree nodes and the maximum degree of the network .",
    "the accurate modeling of these two properties was our motivation for developing a new network model . in section",
    "3 we introduce the positive feedback preferential ( pfp ) model , which is a phenomenological model of the as - level internet topology .",
    "section  4 presents the validation of the model and in section  5 are the conclusions of this work .",
    "scale - free networks can be grouped into assortative , disassortative and neutral networks @xcite . social networks ( e.g. the co - authorship network ) are assortative networks , in which high - degree nodes prefer to attach to other high - degree nodes .",
    "information networks ( e.g. the world wide web and the internet ) and biological networks ( e.g. protein interaction networks ) have been classified as disassortative networks , in which high - degree nodes tend to connect with low - degree ones .",
    "while the as - level internet is disassortative  @xcite , this property does not imply that the high - degree nodes are tightly interconnected to each other ( see fig .  [ fig : diagrichclub ] ) .",
    "one of the structural properties of the as - level internet is that it contains a small number of high - degree nodes .",
    "we call these nodes , `` rich '' nodes , and the set containing them , the `` rich - club '' .",
    "the inter - connectivity among the club members is quantified by the rich - club connectivity  @xcite which is defined as follows .",
    "the rank @xmath11 of a node denotes its position on a list of all nodes sorted in decreasing degree . if the network has @xmath12 nodes then @xmath13 $ ] . if the rich - club consists of the first @xmath11 nodes in the rank list , then the rich - club connectivity @xmath14 is defined as the ratio of the number of links connecting the club members over the maximum number of allowable links , @xmath15 .",
    "the rich - club connectivity measures how well club members `` know '' each other .",
    "a rich - club connectivity of @xmath16 means that all the members have a direct link to any other member , i.e. they form a fully connected subgraph .",
    ".[table : parameter]network parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     fig.[fig : richclub ] shows the rich - club connectivity as a function of the rank normalized by the number of nodes .",
    "it is clear that in the as graph the high - degree nodes are tightly interconnected .",
    "the top 1% best - connected nodes of the as graph have 27% of the possible interconnections , compared with only 4.5% obtained from a network topology generated using the ba model which has the same number of nodes and slightly larger number of links as the as graph ( see table i ) .",
    "the rich - club consists of highly connected nodes , which are well interconnected between each other and the average hop distance among the club members is very small ( 1 to 2 hops ) .",
    "the rich - club is a `` super '' traffic hub of the network and the disassortative mixing property ensures that peripheral nodes are always near the hub .",
    "these two structural properties together contribute to the routing efficiency of the network .",
    "an internet model that does not reproduces the properties of the rich - club will underestimate the actual network s routing efficiency ( shortest path length ) and routing flexibility ( alternative reachable paths ) , and also , it will overestimate the network robustness under node - attack  @xcite .",
    "the ba model is based solely on the attachment of new nodes .",
    "however the appearance of new internal links among old nodes has also been observed in the evolution of the internet  @xcite . during the last few years , researchers have proposed a number of internet models using the appearance of new internal links , such as dorogovtsev and mendes model  @xcite , bu and towsley s generalized linear preference ( glp ) model  @xcite , bianconi  _ et  al _ s generalized network growth ( gng ) model  @xcite , caldarelli  _ et  al _ s model  @xcite and the interactive growth ( ig ) model  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the appearance of new internal links , these models have also used different preference schemes to capture selected properties of the internet .",
    "here we revisit the interactive growth ( ig ) model as it is the precursor of the positive feedback preference model and the ig model provides a possible way to reproduce both the power - law degree distribution and the rich - club connectivity of the as graph .",
    "the ig model generates a network using the _ interactive growth _ , where new internal links start from the host nodes , which are the old nodes that new nodes are attached to .",
    "the ig model starts with a small random network , at each time step ,    * with probability @xmath17 , a new node is attached to one host node and two new internal links appear between the host node and two other old nodes ( peer nodes ) ; * with probability @xmath18 , a new node is attached to two host nodes and one new internal link appears between one of the host nodes and a peer node .    in the actual internet ,",
    "new nodes bring new traffic load to its host nodes .",
    "this results in both the increase of traffic volume and the change of traffic pattern around host nodes and triggers the addition of new links connecting host nodes to peer nodes in order to balance network traffic and optimize network performance . from numerical simulations , we found that when @xmath19 the interactive growth also satisfies the following two characteristics observed  @xcite in the internet measurements .",
    "firstly , the majority of new nodes are added to the system by attaching them to one or two old nodes ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "secondly the degree distribution of the as graph is not a strict power - law as it has more nodes with degree two than nodes with degree one ( @xmath21 , see table  [ table : parameter ] ) .",
    "the ig model uses the ba model s linear preference of eq.([eq : barabasi ] ) in the attachment of new nodes and the appearance of new internal links . as shown in fig.[fig : degree ] , fig.[fig : degreecum ] , fig.[fig : richclub ] and table  [ table : parameter ] , the ig model closely resembles both the power - law degree distribution and the rich - club connectivity of the as graph .",
    "the ig model still has its limitations .",
    "the maximum node degree @xmath22 present in the as graph is nearly a quarter of the number of nodes ( @xmath23 ) and is significantly larger than the maximum degree obtained by the ig and ba models using linear preferential attachment ( see table  [ table : parameter ] ) . to overcome this shortfall , it is possible to favor high - degree nodes by using the nonlinear preferential probability  @xcite @xmath24    to examine the above nonlinear preference , here we study a so - called _ test * _ model , which is a modification of the ig model .",
    "test * _ model uses the same interactive growth mechanism as the ig model , but it does not use the linear preference given by eq.([eq : barabasi ] ) , instead it uses the nonlinear preference given by eq.([eq : nonlineal ] ) .",
    "numerical experiments showed that , when @xmath25 , the _ test * _ model generates networks with the maximum degree similar to the as graph .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : richclub ] , the rich - club connectivity produced by the _ test * _ model deviates from the as graph . for example , the 1% best connected nodes of the _ test * _ model have 42% allowable interconnections compared with 27% of the as graph .",
    "based on the internet - history data , pastor - satorras  _ et  al _",
    "@xcite and vzquez  _ et  al _  @xcite measured that the probability that a new node links with a low - degree old node follows the linear preferential attachment given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : barabasi ] ) . whereas chen  _ et  al _  @xcite reported that high - degree nodes have a stronger ability of acquiring new links than predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : barabasi ] ) .",
    "the internet - history data also show that at early times , the degree of node increases very slowly ; later on , the degree grows more and more rapidly . taking into account these observations",
    ", we modified the ig model by using the nonlinear preferential attachment @xmath26 .",
    "\\label{eq : pfp}\\ ] ] we call this the positive - feedback preference ( pfp ) model . from numerical simulations , we found that @xmath27 produces the best result .",
    "( it is interesting to notice that for @xmath27 and the maximum degree @xmath28 as measured on the as graph , the exponent function of @xmath29 , which is close to the value of @xmath30 used in the _ test * _ model ) .",
    "we also refine the interactive growth mechanism .",
    "the pfp model starts with a small random network , at each time step ,    * with probability @xmath31 $ ] , a new node is attached to one host node ; and at the same time one new internal link appears between the host node and a peer node ; * with probability @xmath32 $ ] , a new node is attached to one host node ; and at the same time two new internal links appear between the host node and two peer nodes ; * with probability @xmath33 , a new node is attached to two host nodes ; and at the same time one new internal link appears between one of the host nodes and one peer node ;    when @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the generated pfp network has the same ratio of nodes to links as in the as graph ( see table  [ table : parameter ] ) .",
    "eq.([eq : pfp ] ) is used in choosing host nodes and peer nodes .",
    "the pfp model satisfies pastor - sartorras  _ et  al _ , vzquez  _ et  al _ and chen  _ et  al _ s observations . for low - degree nodes ,",
    "the preferential attachment is approximated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : barabasi ] ) . for high - degree nodes , the preferential attachment increases as a nonlinear function of the node degree ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : degreefunctions ] ) .",
    "hence , as the time passes by , the rate of degree growth in the pfp model is faster than in the ig model and the ba model ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : degreetime ] ) .",
    "the validation was done by comparing the as graph  @xcite with networks generated by the pfp model , the ig model and the ba model . for each model , ten different networks were generated and averaged .",
    "the networks had the same number of nodes and similar numbers of links as the as graph ( see table  [ table : parameter ] ) .",
    "the pfp model produces networks that closely matches the degree distribution ( see fig.[fig : degree ] and fig.[fig : degreecum ] ) , the rich - club connectivity ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : richclub ] ) and the maximum degree ( see table  i ) of the as graph .",
    "also the networks generated using the pfp model have the same power - law relationship between degree and rank , @xmath36 as the as graph ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : degreerank ] ) . in certain respect",
    "the accuracy of the pfp model to reproduce these properties is not a surprise .",
    "after all , the model was designed to match these properties .",
    "the average shortest - path length @xmath37 , of a node is defined as the average of the shortest - paths from the node to all other nodes in the network .",
    "fig.[fig : lengthdistribution ] and fig.[fig : lengthdegree ] show that the pfp model reproduces the cumulative distribution of average shortest - path length and the correlation between average shortest - path length and degree of the as graph .",
    "the characteristic path length @xmath38 , of a network is the average of the shortest - paths over all pairs of nodes .",
    "the characteristic path length indicates the network overall routing efficiency .",
    "the as graph is a small - world network  @xcite because the characteristic path length is very small compared with the network size . table  [ table : parameter ] shows that the as graph and the networks obtained from the pfp model have nearly the same characteristic path length .",
    "cycles  @xcite encode the redundant information in the network structure .",
    "the number of short cycles ( triangles and quadrangles ) is a relevant property because the multiplicity of paths between any two nodes increases with the density of short cycles ( note that an alternative path between two nodes can be longer than their shortest - path ) .",
    "the triangle coefficient @xmath39 , is defined as the number of triangles that a node shares .",
    "similarly the quadrangle coefficient @xmath40 , is the number of quadrangles that a node has .",
    "table  [ table : parameter ] shows the as graph and the networks generated using the pfp model have higher densities of short cycles ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) than networks generated using the ig model and the ba model .",
    "fig.[fig : ptricum ] and fig.[fig : prectcum ] show that the as graph and the networks obtained from the pfp model have similar cumulative distributions of short cycles .",
    "fig.[fig : tridegree ] and fig.[fig : rectdegree ] show that the pfp networks exhibit similar correlations between short cycles and degree as in the as graph .",
    "notice that the clustering coefficient @xmath43 of a node can be expressed as a function of the node s degree @xmath0 and triangle coefficient @xmath39 , @xmath44 the reason we study short cycles instead of clustering coefficient is that short cycles have the advantage of providing neighbor clustering information of nodes with different degrees .",
    "the internet exhibits the disassortative mixing behavior  @xcite , where on average , high - degree nodes tend to connect to peripheral nodes with low degrees .",
    "a network s mixing pattern is identified by the conditional probability @xmath45 that a link connects a node with degree @xmath0 to a node with degree @xmath46 .",
    "this conditional probability can be indicated  @xcite by @xmath47 , the nearest - neighbors average degree of a node with degree @xmath0 .",
    "fig.[fig : pknncum ] and table  [ table : parameter ] show that on average the nearest - neighbors average degree of a node in the as graph and the pfp networks is significantly larger than that in the ig and ba networks .",
    "fig.[fig : knndegree ] shows that the pfp model closely reproduces the negative correlation between nearest - neighbors average degree and node degree of the as graph and therefore exhibits similar disassortative mixing as the as graph .      on a network",
    ", there are nodes that are more prominent because they are highly used when transferring information .",
    "a way to measure this `` importance '' is by using the concept of node _ betweenness centrality _ which is defined as follows .",
    "given a source node @xmath48 and a destination node @xmath49 , the number of different shortest - paths from @xmath48 to @xmath49 is @xmath50 .",
    "the number of shortest - paths that contain the node @xmath51 is @xmath52 .",
    "the proportion of shortest - paths , from @xmath48 to @xmath49 , which contain node @xmath51 is @xmath53 .",
    "the betweenness centrality of node @xmath51 is defined  @xcite as @xmath54 where the sum is over all possible pairs of nodes with @xmath55 .",
    "the betweenness centrality measures the proportion of shortest paths which visit a certain node . if all pairs of nodes of a network communicate at the same rate , the betweenness centrality estimates the node s capacity needed for a free - flow status  @xcite .",
    "a node with a large @xmath56 is `` important '' because it carries a large traffic load .",
    "if this node fails or gets congested , the consequences to the network traffic can be drastic @xcite . here",
    "the betweenness centrality is normalized by the number of nodes and denoted as @xmath57 .",
    "the average of the ( normalized ) betweenness centrality in a network @xmath58  @xcite , where @xmath38 is the network s characteristic path length .",
    "fig.[fig : bdistribution ] shows that the cumulative distribution of betweenness centrality @xmath59 of the networks exhibit similar power - law behaviors characterized by slope @xmath60 , hence",
    "@xmath61  @xcite .",
    "however as shown in table  [ table : parameter ] , the maximum value of the betweenness centrality , @xmath62 , for the as graph and the pfp model are significantly larger than that for the ig model and the ba model .",
    "fig.[fig : bdegree ] shows that only the pfp model closely matches the correlation between betweenness centrality and degree of the as graph .",
    "in summary , the pfp model accurately reproduces many of the topological properties measured in the internet at the as level .",
    "the model is based on two growth mechanisms which are the nonlinear positive - feedback preferential attachment combined with the interactive growth of new nodes and new internal links .",
    "both the mechanisms are based on ( and supported by ) the observations on the internet history data .",
    "the positive - feedback preference means that , as a node acquires new links , the node s relative advantage when competing for more links increases as a non - linear feed - back loop .",
    "this implies the inequality in the link - acquiring ability between rich nodes and non - rich nodes increases as the network evolves .",
    "rich nodes , not only become richer , they become disproportionately richer . while our initial motivation was to create a model that can accurately reproduce the rich - club connectivity and the maximum degree of the as graph , the pfp model actually captures other properties as well .",
    "further studies are needed to explain why the internet growth seems to follow the non - linear preferential attachment given by the pfp model and what are the consequences of this growth mechanism for the future of the internet .",
    "this research provides an insight into the basic mechanisms that could be responsible for the evolving topology of complex networks .",
    "finally , the validation of the model was not conducted with measurement data based on the bgp - tables , but with the traceroute - derived as graph , which is regarded as a more realistic and reliable measurement of the internet  @xcite .",
    "the authors would like to thank the referees for their useful comments .",
    "this work is funded by the u. k. engineering and physical sciences research council ( epsrc ) under grant no .",
