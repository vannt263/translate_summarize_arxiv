    "the first law of black hole thermodynamics has had a long and subtle history , starting with bekenstein s proposal @xcite that the entropy should be proportional to the area followed by hawking s seminal work on black hole - temperature @xcite .",
    "notably absent in the discussion of the first law has been a @xmath0 term , associated with changes in volume .",
    "it is shown here that , for rotating black holes , a thermodynamic volume can be defined which is independent of the area allowing a complete form of the first law to be formulated .",
    "it has been suggested by a number of authors @xcite-@xcite that , for a black hole of mass @xmath5 when a cosmological constant is included , the first law of thermodynamics should read [ firstlaw ] d",
    "m = tds + d j + d q + d , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the entropy , angular momentum and charge respectively while @xmath9 is a thermodynamic variable conjugate to the cosmological constant @xmath10 . since @xmath10 is associated with a pressure , @xmath11 in units with @xmath12 , one interpretation of the @xmath13 term is that it is related to the familiar term @xmath0 term in the first law , with @xmath9 proportional to the volume .",
    "this in turn requires interpreting the black hole mass as corresponding to the thermodynamic enthalpy , @xmath14 , rather than the more usual interpretation as the thermal energy @xmath15 , @xcite .",
    "one then has [ dh ] d m = tds + d j + d q + vdp , where the thermodynamic volume , v=[vdef ] .|_s , j , q=-8 , is the legendre transform of the pressure . in full generality , the first law of black hole thermodynamics now reads [ firstlaw ] d u = tds + d j + d q -pdv , where @xmath16 . in this work",
    "we shall set @xmath17 for simplicity , our results are easily extended to include the @xmath18 case .    of course if @xmath10 is truly constant , @xmath19 can not be varied and the last term in ( [ dh ] ) is always zero , though the last term in ( [ firstlaw ] ) need not be zero and can have physical consequences @xcite .",
    "but it is commonly supposed , in inflationary models for example , that @xmath10 has at some time in the past been significantly different from its current value and so must vary .",
    "unfortunately the thermodynamics of black holes with @xmath20 are not well understood : such a system has two different temperatures in general , one associated with the black hole horizon and one with the cosmological horizon , and in addition there is no asymptotic regime in which an invariant mass can be defined . for these reasons",
    "we shall primarily restrict ourselves to the better understood @xmath21 case in this work .",
    "this is sufficient to access the @xmath22 limit .",
    "the mass of a charged ads - kerr black hole , with cosmological constant @xmath23 , was expressed as a function of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 in @xcite . when @xmath17 the expression is [ cckmass ] m(s , p , j)= , where @xmath12 and @xmath6 is @xmath24 the area of the event horizon . from this",
    "the temperature can be evaluated , [ ccktemperature ] t= .|_p , j=\\ { ( 1 + ) ( 1 + 8 p s ) -4 ^ 2 } , with @xmath25 .",
    "the temperature vanishes for extremal black holes , with maximum angular momentum [ jextremal ] j^2_max= ( ) ^2(1 + ) ( 1 + 8 p s ) .",
    "the legendre transform of ( [ cckmass ] ) , [ internalenergy ] u(s , v , j ) = ( ) ^3\\ { ( ) ( + j^2 ) -j^2 } , was studied in @xcite , where the difference between the specific heat at constant pressure c_p = t.|_p , j = t and specific heat at constant volume c_v = t.|_v , j = t was also explored .",
    "explicit expressions confirm that @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 diverges along the curve in the @xmath31 plane shown in figure 1 ( plotted using dimensionless variables @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "@xmath30 is negative in the region below this curve and the critical point corresponds to the maximum value of @xmath32 which is determined numerically to lie at @xmath34 and @xmath35 . when @xmath36 , c_p= which is negative when @xmath37 , the famous negative heat capacity of schwarzschild black holes refers to @xmath30",
    ".    this instability is reflected in the isothermal compressibility _",
    "t&=&- ( ) _ t , j + & = & , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 diverges when the denominator vanishes , which is the same locus of points on which @xmath30 diverges and is shown below in the @xmath41 plane appropriate for constant @xmath19 processes ,        thus increasing the pressure , keeping the area and angular momentum constant , causes the volume of the black hole to decrease , while at the same time the mass must increase according to ( [ cckmass ] ) .",
    "@xmath43 vanishes when @xmath36 , so non - rotating black holes are adiabatically incompressible , but it increases with @xmath7 attaining a maximum value in the extremal case , ( [ jextremal ] ) , when [ extremalbeta ] ._s|_t=0= .    a speed of sound , @xmath1 ,",
    "can also be associated with the black hole , in the usual thermodynamic sense that v_s^-2 = .|_s , j= 1 + _ s = 1 + , where @xmath44 is a density .",
    "this is not the sound associated with any kind of surface wave on the event horizon , an impossibility due to the no hair theorem , but rather it is associated with a breathing mode for the black hole as the volume changes with the pressure , keeping the area constant .",
    "clearly @xmath45 ( this is also true when @xmath18 ) .",
    "the speed of sound is unity for incompressible non - rotating black holes and is lowest for the extremal case .v_s^-2|_t=0= 1+()^2 , giving @xmath46 when @xmath37 and @xmath47 achieving a minimum value of @xmath48 when @xmath49 .",
    "these results show that the equation of state is very stiff for adiabatic variations of non - rotating black holes and softens as @xmath7 increases . for comparison ,",
    "the adiabatic compressibility of a degenerate gas of @xmath50 relativistic neutrons in a volume @xmath51 at zero temperature follows from the degeneracy pressure p_deg=(3 ^ 2)^1 3()^-4 3 _ s = 3 4p_deg.for a neutron star @xmath52 and @xmath53 . with zero cosmological constant the black hole adiabatic compressibility at zero temperature",
    "is given by ( [ extremalbeta ] ) with @xmath37 , [ betazerop ] ._s|_t",
    "= p=0= = , where the relevant factors of @xmath2 and @xmath54 are included . putting in the numbers ._s|_t=0=2.610",
    "^ -38()^2  ms^2kg^-1 , which is still two orders of magnitude less than that of a neutron star even for @xmath55 .",
    "we conclude that the zero temperature black hole equation of state is stiffer than that of a neutron star .",
    "a subtlety with this analysis of adiabatic compressibility is that , if a black hole is extremal and the pressure goes down , keeping the entropy and the angular momentum fixed , then the extremal value of the angular momentum ( [ jextremal ] ) goes down and the black hole ends up with an angular momentum above the new extremal value , giving a naked singularity .",
    "one interpretation of this would be that cosmic censorship simply does not allow such a process to occur and , at zero @xmath56 , the entropy must increase , if the pressure is decreased , in such a way as to avoid the extremal angular momentum going down .",
    "if the extremal angular momentum is kept constant then , from ( [ jextremal ] ) , .|_t=0 = - . with this constraint",
    "the zero temperature compressibility is increased above the adiabatic value , in fact it becomes identical to the zero temperature isothermal compressibility , _",
    "t=0=. at zero pressure this is a factor of 33 larger than ( [ betazerop ] ) , hence cosmic censorship effectively makes the zero temperature equation of state softer .",
    "although the analysis presented here is strictly only valid for @xmath57 nothing obviously goes wrong for @xmath58 , provided @xmath59 , and it may be reasonable to analytically continue these thermodynamic relations to negative pressures , @xcite , provided the resulting positive cosmological constant is not too large .",
    "it has been suggested that mini black holes could have been created in the early universe , @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , and they are created with a range of angular momenta , it is interesting to speculate that a collection of such compressible black holes might affect the speed of sound through the surrounding medium , in the same way that a suspension of compressible spheres would affect the speed of sound in a fluid .",
    "in summary it has been argued that a @xmath0 term should be included to complete the first law of black hole thermodynamics since the thermodynamic volume is independent of the area for rotating black holes .",
    "the famous instability of black holes due to negative heat capacity is associated with the heat capacity at constant pressure rather than the heat capacity at constant volume and compressibilities , together with the speed of sound , have been calculated .    11 j.d .",
