    "one important evidence for the formation of strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite in high - energy heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is the observation that the produced dense matter is opaque to a propagating parton due to jet quenching @xcite which suppresses not only the single inclusive hadron spectra at large transverse momentum @xcite but also back - to - back high @xmath3 dihadron @xcite and @xmath6-hadron correlation @xcite .",
    "these observed jet quenching patterns in heavy - ion collisions at rhic can be described by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) parton models well @xcite that incorporate parton energy loss @xcite as it propagates through dense matter .",
    "since the energy loss or medium modification of the effective jet fragmentation functions depends on the space - time profile of parton density in the medium , any systematic and qualitative extraction of the properties of the medium through phenomenological study of jet quenching has to take into account the dynamical evolution of the bulk matter @xcite .",
    "the initial condition for the evolution of bulk matter is either provided by model calculation or experimental data on the total charged hadron multiplicity . without any experimental data on hadron production in heavy - ion collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , all predictions for jet quenching @xcite have to rely on theoretical or phenomenological models on the initial condition for bulk matter production and evolution .",
    "however , these theoretical and phenomenological predictions for the bulk hadron production @xcite vary by almost a factor of two and , consequently , lead to the same amount of uncertainties in the predictions for suppression of large transverse momentum hadrons in heavy - ion collisions at the lhc .    recently , alice experiment at lhc published the first experimental data on the charged hadron multiplicity density at mid - rapidity in central @xmath1 collisions at @xmath7 tev @xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath8 for the top 5% central @xmath1 collisions is larger than most of theoretical predictions , especially those from the so - called color - glass - condensate models @xcite .",
    "such an unexpected large hadron multiplicity will have important consequences on theoretical predictions for jet quenching in @xmath1 collisions at the lhc energies .",
    "the predictions for single and dihadron suppression in the most central @xmath1 collisions at @xmath9 tev by wang , wang and zhang @xcite relied on the modified hijing calculation @xcite of the charged hadron multiplicity in heavy - ion collisions at the lhc .",
    "the modification has now been incorporated into hijing 2.0 version @xcite of the original hijing1.0 model @xcite .",
    "the new hijingh2.0 results @xcite agree well with the first alice data @xcite within experimental errors and theoretical uncertainty which is controlled mainly by the uncertainty in nuclear shadowing of gluon distribution in nuclei .    with the first alice data",
    "@xcite providing more stringent constraints on the theoretical uncertainty in the bulk hadron production , we would like to revisit the predictions on suppression of single inclusive hadron spectra at large @xmath3 in heavy - ion collisions at lhc .",
    "moreover , we will use the 3 + 1d ideal hydrodynamic model for more realistic description of the bulk matter evolution whose initial conditions at lhc are also much better constrained by the first alice data .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will provide a brief overview of the pqcd parton model for single inclusive hadron spectra and the high - twist ( ht ) approach to the medium modified fragmentation functions . in sec .",
    "iii , we will give a brief description of the 3 + 1d ideal hydrodynamic model for the bulk evolution with initial condition provided by hijing2.0 model and further constrained by the first alice data . in sec .",
    "iv , we present predictions for the nuclear modification factor @xmath0 for neutral pions in @xmath1 collisions at lhc energy @xmath2 tev/@xmath10 and discuss about first lhc data for the charged hadrons from the alice experiment .",
    "we will give a summary and discussion in sec .",
    "we will employ the next leading order ( nlo ) pqcd parton model for the initial jet production spectra which has been shown to work well for large @xmath11 hadron production in high energy nucleon - nucleon collisions  @xcite .",
    "we use the same factorized form for the inclusive particle production cross section in @xmath12 heavy - ion collisions , which can be expressed as a convolution of parton distribution functions inside the nuclei ( nucleons ) , elementary parton - parton scattering cross sections and effective parton fragmentation functions , @xmath13 where @xmath14 are elementary parton scattering cross sections at leading order ( lo ) @xmath15 .",
    "the average over the azimuthal angle of the initial jet is implicitly implied in the above equation since we focus on azimuthal integrated single inclusive hadron cross section .",
    "the nlo contributions include @xmath16 tree level contributions and 1-loop virtual corrections to @xmath17 tree processes @xcite .",
    "the nuclear thickness function is normalized to @xmath18 .",
    "the nuclear parton distributions per nucleon @xmath19 are assumed to be factorized into the parton distributions in a free nucleon @xmath20 and the nuclear shadowing factor @xmath21 , @xmath22,\\label{eqn : shad}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the charge and @xmath24 the mass number of the nucleus .",
    "the cteq6 m parameterization @xcite for parton distribution functions will be used for nucleon parton distributions @xmath20 .",
    "the parton shadowing factor @xmath25 describes the nuclear modification of parton distributions per nucleon inside a nucleus and can be given by parameterizations @xcite . with an impact - parameter - dependent parton shadowing the effect of shadowing",
    "is the strongest for hard scatterings at the center of the transverse plane .",
    "but partons from these hard scatterings at the center are mostly quenched due to parton energy loss and do not contribute to the final hadron spectra .",
    "therefore , the effect of parton shadowing is negligible for the final hadron spectra in @xmath26 collisions that are dominated by hard scattering close to the surface of the overlapping nuclei @xcite .",
    "we will set @xmath25=1.0 in the calculation .",
    "effect of jet quenching in dense medium in heavy - ion collisions will be described by effective medium modified parton fragmentation functions @xmath27 within the ht approach .    within the generalized factorization of twist - four processes",
    ", one can calculate the parton energy loss and medium modified fragmentation functions of a propagating parton in the medium after it is produced via a hard process @xcite .",
    "within such a high - twist approach , the medium modification to the parton fragmentation functions is caused by multiple scattering inside the medium and induced gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "the medium modified quark fragmentation functions , @xmath28 , \\label{eq : mo - fragment}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] take a form very similar to the vacuum bremsstrahlung corrections that lead to the evolution equations in pqcd for fragmentation functions , except that the medium modified splitting functions , @xmath29 and @xmath30 depend on the properties of the medium via the jet transport parameter @xmath31 @xcite , @xmath32 or the average squared transverse momentum broadening per unit length , which is also related to the gluon distribution density of the medium @xcite . the corresponding quark energy loss can be expressed as @xcite , @xmath33 , \\label{eq : de - twist}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of the jet transport parameter .",
