    "the coupling of a quantum system with an environment or under a continuous measurement is often modelled via a quantum master equation in the lindblad form @xcite . unlike a quantum system evolving coherently , the time evolution of which depends on the initial state , a quantum system with pumping tends to a nonequilibrium steady state , independent of the initial conditions .",
    "recently there has been a large interest in investigating chains of quantum spins driven towards nonequilibrium steady states by applying gradients ( pumping ) at the edges . an important role in these studies",
    "is played by the one dimensional driven xxz chain .",
    "the equilibrium xxz model remains a subject of intensive investigations via various methods @xcite . in experiments ,",
    "many transport characteristics in quasi one - dimensional spin chain materials can be measured @xcite . in the context of dissipative dynamics , recent numerical and analytic studies of a driven xxz chain show a number of remarkable features like long range order and quantum phase transitions far from equilibrium @xcite , negative differential conductivity of spin and energy @xcite , solvability @xcite etc ..",
    "recently it was shown that an isotropic point @xmath3 , a weakly driven @xmath1 spin chain has an anomalous spin transport @xcite .",
    "the current - carrying nonequilibrium steady state was obtained by bringing an @xmath1 spin chain in contact with reservoirs aligning the boundary spins along the @xmath5-axis .",
    "the boundary gradient was small , which allows to think in terms of linear response of a system to the weak perturbation along the anisotropy axis .    from a standard theory of linear response",
    "@xcite one expects that the result of linear response will not depend on a form of boundary perturbation as long as it remains sufficiently weak . respectively , an anomaly seen with one type of perturbation , should be visible with another type of perturbation as well .",
    "on the other hand , the linear response theory is valid for system in thermodynamic equilibrium at a certain temperature , while the driven chains with dissipative boundary driving are intrinsically nonequilibrium systems . at `` zero gradient ''",
    "the ness describes a system without currents , in a maximally mixed quantum state , which corresponds to a gibbs ensemble with an infinite temperature . to test further the linear response regime in a situation of a nonequilibrium",
    ", we investigate a weakly driven @xmath1 chain , where the weak boundary gradient at the boundaries is applied in the @xmath2 direction , transverse to the anisotropy axis @xcite .",
    "note that there are two complementary ways of realizing a weak drive in a master equation formalism : ( i ) to set a weak boundary gradient , but finite or strong coupling to boundary reservoirs ( ii ) to set a weak coupling to reservoir , but finite or strong boundary gradient .",
    "interestingly , in both contexts ( either weak gradient @xmath6 or weak coupling @xmath7 ) we see a distinct anomaly in the ness . the anomaly becomes a singularity as @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "of the magnetization current in the isotropic point @xmath3 . for weak coupling the anomaly sets in for @xmath10 and for weak driving for @xmath11 .",
    "the presence of an anomaly is seen in practically all observables . in present communication",
    "we focus on singular behaviour of the steady currents of spin @xmath12 and energy @xmath13 , and one - point correlations at the boundaries .",
    "the full analytic treatment is reported for spin current . in the limit @xmath9 or @xmath8",
    "we observe a non - analyticity in the dependence @xmath14 : the spin current is an analytic smooth function of @xmath15 everywhere except at isotropic point @xmath3 where its value is different .",
    "the nature of singularity , in addition , depends on the parity of system size , namely on whether the system size is an even or an odd number .",
    "other observables e.g. current of energy , density profiles etc . also have a singular behaviour at @xmath4 .",
    "thus , we can complement the result of znidaric @xcite with prediction of further anomalies at the isotropic point .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that the energy current also develops an anomaly at the isotropic point , but with a different scaling and of a qualitatively different form .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "we introduce the model in the sec.[sec::the model ] .",
    "the cases of weak coupling and weak driving are treated separately in sec.[sec::weakcoupling ] and sec.[sec::weakgradient ] . in the conclusion",
    "we summarize our findings .",
    "we study an open chain of @xmath16 quantum spins in contact with boundary reservoirs .",

    "the parameter @xmath44 determines the amplitude of the gradient between the left and right boundary , and therefore plays a fundamentally different role from the coupling strength @xmath45 .",
    "the limits @xmath46 and @xmath6 will be referred to as the strong driving and weak driving case respectively .",
    "the two limits describe different physical situations as exemplified in other ness  studies . for symmetric choice ( [ symmetryu - uprime ] ) the steady state",

    "in addition , there are further transformations , see @xcite for details , relating the ness  for positive and negative @xmath15 , @xmath53@xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and conjugate is taken in the basis where @xmath57 is diagonal . in view of the above symmetries , below we restrict to the case of positive @xmath58 .",
    "we shall consider two particular limits :    \\a ) weak coupling , @xmath7 , strong driving ( large gradient ) @xmath46 ) .",
    "\\b ) weak gradient @xmath6 , strong coupling @xmath59    both limits show qualitatively similar singular behaviour as @xmath60 or @xmath8 , at the isotropic point @xmath3 as demonstrated below .",
    "to investigate the system in the case of large boundary gradients @xmath46 and weak coupling @xmath7 , we solve the linear system of equations which determine the full steady state , analytically , making use of the global symmetry ( [ symmetryglobal ] ) @xcite which decreases the number of unknown variables by roughly a factor of @xmath61 .",
    "for @xmath62 we have indeed @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 real unknowns , respectively , instead of @xmath66 real unknowns for the full hilbert space .",
    "for @xmath67 the current @xmath68 is readily obtained as @xmath69 from which we see that at the points @xmath4 and in the small coupling limit , it scales quadratically with @xmath45 , @xmath70 note , however , that for @xmath71 the current scales as @xmath72 , i.e @xmath73    for @xmath74 the current @xmath68 at @xmath3 , still scales as @xmath75 , @xmath76 but a different scaling behavior , with respect to @xmath67 case , is obtained for other @xmath15 points , where the @xmath12 is found to scale also quadratically , @xmath77 taking the limit @xmath78 in the above , we obtain @xmath79 different from ( [ n=3singularity0 ] ) .",
    "consequently , the limits @xmath78 and @xmath8 do not commute . in more details , we have @xmath80 from which eq([n=3singularity0 ] ) is straightforwardly obtained .",
    "alternatively , one can see the presence of a singularity at all even orders of expansion of @xmath81 : starting from the order @xmath82 of the expansion , all even terms @xmath83 contain poles at @xmath4 of the type @xmath84 , e.g. @xmath85 with @xmath86 a rational function which is regular at points @xmath4 .    for @xmath87 one can see that the current at @xmath4 scales with @xmath45 as : @xmath88",
    "from which it follows that in the small coupling limit the current reduces to @xmath89 at all other points @xmath71 , however , the current scales as for the @xmath67 case , e.g",
    "@xmath90    although analytical expressions of the current are very difficult to obtain for larger values of @xmath16 ( e.g. @xmath91 ) , we can infer from numerical calculations that similar behavior exist also in these more complicated cases .",
    "indeed , from the exact expressions reported above and from direct numerical calculations it is possible to extrapolate the values of the current for arbitrary @xmath16 at the points @xmath92 in the small coupling limit as : @xmath93 hinting at @xmath94 becoming a singular point in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "one can readily see that our conjecture ( [ generalcurrent ] ) coincides with the exact values reported in eqs .",
    "( [ j2singularity ] ) , ( [ n=3singularity0 ] ) , ( [ j4singularity ] ) for cases @xmath62 , respectively . moreover , numerical results provides us a high confidence about the validity of eq .",
    "( [ generalcurrent ] ) for arbitrary @xmath16 .",
    "more precisely , we find from direct numerical solutions of the lme that the peaks of the current for @xmath95 at @xmath96 are : @xmath97 , respectively , in perfect agreement with the prediction of eq.([generalcurrent ] ) .",
    "also note from fig .",
    "[ fig : xy ] that the numerical values of the current peaks depicted in panels ( c),(d ) for cases @xmath98 ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively ) are in excellent agreement with eq .",
    "( [ generalcurrent ] ) .",
    "moreover , using the matrix product ansatz @xcite , we were able to check the conjecture ( [ generalcurrent ] ) analytically up to sizes @xmath101 ( details to be published elsewhere ) . from the physical point of view , eq .",
    "( [ generalcurrent ] ) is quite interesting because it implies that in the weak coupling limit an addition of an extra spin to a finite chain contributes to the total current by a `` quantum '' of @xmath102 .",
    "since the spin current is bounded , the eq.([generalcurrent ] ) hints at a singularity in @xmath94 point in the thermodynamic limit @xmath103 . further details and an analytical proof of ( [ generalcurrent ] ) will be presented elsewhere .",
    "one naturally expects that the noticed singular behaviour of the driven @xmath1 model at the isotropic point is not restricted to the magnetization current but can be seen for other observables as well . here",
    "we show that the energy current is also anomalous at the isotropic point .",
    "our purpose here , in addition , is to demonstrate , that the global symmetry ( [ symmetryglobal ] ) is not crucial for singularity , because the energy current only flows if the symmetry ( [ symmetryglobal ] ) is broken .",
    "indeed , the energy current operator @xmath104 , defined through the local hamiltonian term @xmath105 as @xmath106 @xmath107 where @xmath108 , changes sign under the action of ( [ symmetryglobal ] ) , @xmath109 @xmath110 and therefore in the stationary state it is strictly zero @xmath111 ( as a local integral of motion , the energy current does not depend on the choice of the bond @xmath112 ) . lifting up the symmetric choice for the couplings to the left and right reservoirs in ( [ lme ] ) , i.e. , considering the lindblad equation ( [ lme ] ) with @xmath43 we break the symmetry ( [ symmetryglobal ] ) and the energy current becomes permissible , see also @xcite .",
    "the current of energy for small couplings @xmath113 with a fixed ratio @xmath114 shows , again , an approach to a singularity in the isotropic point , but with a different scaling , @xmath115 , and qualitatively different behaviour , see fig.[fig : je ] . indeed , the anomaly of energy current at the isotropic point has a shape of a twin peak , which , as @xmath116 decreases , becomes more and more narrow , see fig.[fig : je : cc ] , and for @xmath117 develops a twin peak singularity .",
    "for @xmath87 we see a twin peak singularity at @xmath3 and a single peak singularity at @xmath118 , illustrated on fig.[fig : je](b ) .",
    "unlike the spin current which is the odd ( even ) function of @xmath15 for odd ( even ) number of sites , the energy current is always an odd function of @xmath15 .",
    "these parity features are direct consequences of the mappings ( [ symmetryeven ] ) and ( [ symmetryodd ] ) , see also @xcite .",
    "further details will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "here we just mention another observable which has a singularity at the isotropic point , also in the symmetric case @xmath119 :  it is the actual value of magnetizations at the boundaries : @xmath120 , @xmath121,@xmath122 , which , as @xmath8 , remain finite at @xmath3 , and attain different values at the point @xmath123 , data not shown .",
    "interestingly , this singularity cancels in the difference @xmath124 and @xmath125 : the actual magnetization differences @xmath126 are regular at @xmath3 .    at this point",
    "one might suspect , that the singularities in the currents of spin and energy are just artefacts ( or direct consequences ) of the singular behaviour of the boundary gradients . to eliminate the influence of the irregular behaviour of the boundary gradients , in the next section we consider another limit , where we control not only the boundary gradients @xmath127 , but also the individual magnetizations at the boundaries @xmath128 , @xmath129,@xmath130 , @xmath131 , which become exactly equal to @xmath132 , respectively .",
    "in this section we investigate the weak gradient and strong coupling case ( @xmath6,@xmath59 ) by means of the perturbative approach for the lme in powers of @xmath133 , developed in @xcite .",
    "note that while in the standard derivation of the lindblad master equation one usually assumes the coupling to the reservoirs to be weak@xcite,@xcite , in the ancilla master equation construction @xcite this restriction is lifted and the effective coupling can become arbitrarily strong .",
    "we also remark that the uniqueness of the nonequilibrium steady state for any coupling @xmath45 is guaranteed by the completeness of the algebra , generated by the set of operators @xmath134 under multiplication and addition @xcite , and is verified straightforwardly along the lines @xcite .",
