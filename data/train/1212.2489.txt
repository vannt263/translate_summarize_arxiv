    "the scattering through waveguides with surface roughness is a ubiquitous phenomenon which occurs on different length and time scales both in the natural environment and in different artificial systems @xcite .",
    "whereas for environmental waveguides the problems related to wave scattering at surfaces of random nature are of major importance , for man - made guiding systems the particular attention is called by the scattering produced by the boundaries with periodical corrugation .",
    "periodic structures , in general , have received much attention in different areas of physics through the variety of applications of their peculiar spectra . in particular , waveguides with periodic inserts have for a long time been employed as slow - wave structures in vacuum and accelerator physics @xcite ; photonic ( bragg ) crystals are widely used as frequency selective narrowband resonators and filters in terahertz and optical ranges @xcite ; multilayered films with periodic variation of the refractive index serve as effective mirrors in the vuv and x ranges of em radiation @xcite .",
    "the importance of periodic structures for numerous applications and the diversity of physical effects originating in them have stimulated the development of a number of theoretical methods for their analysis .",
    "the detailed review of the methods developed up to the mid fifties of the 20-th century can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for periodic structures ,",
    "apart from the foremost question of how the forbidden gaps in their spectra originate , there arises a number of other intriguing questions regarding their physical properties , especially for those systems whose inhomogeneities are much less in size than the operating wavelength . until recently it was believed that inhomogeneities of this sort can not crucially affect the wave propagation .",
    "for this reason the studies on structures with sub - wavelength periodic variations of their parameters have for long remained beyond the main line of research until the previous decade , when anomalous wave transmission through sub - wavelength hole arrays in optically thick films was detected @xcite . in our recent paper",
    "@xcite it was also discovered that the small - scale distortion of wave resonator boundaries dramatically affects their spectra .",
    "specifically , it was found that modal content of rough - side resonators was mainly controlled by the sharpness of boundary asperities rather than by their height .",
    "even for the asperities of sub - wavelength nature the spectrum may be adjusted in such a way that at any desirable frequency range the quasioptical resonator can become even a single - frequency one .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite were obtained for closed systems only , being related to their spectral properties .",
    "it would be , however , of great interest to find out if small boundary asperities could produce similar radical effects on the properties of _ open _ systems , in particular , on the wave transmission in waveguide structures . yet , in trying to answer this question one faces the problem which has not so far been adequately resolved .",
    "specifically , any self - consistent theory of a waveguide system with arbitrarily corrugated side walls is relied unavoidably on the results related to plane - wave scattering by such boundaries . for boundaries",
    "whose corrugation is random such theories do exist for a long time .",
    "yet they are all known to allow obtaining the tractable and practically useful results only in the case of smooth roughness , i.e. , for the asperities whose mean - square tangent of slope is small as compared with unity @xcite . for cavity resonators ,",
    "this restriction was overcome in ref .",
    "@xcite , but for systems of general type , including waveguides and different surfaces subject to radiation , this is yet to be done .    in studying the wave scattering by distorted boundaries",
    "the most challenging task is , in general , related to boundaries random character . the scattering by the surfaces whose corrugation is deterministic , in particular , periodic in tangent coordinate seems to be , at first glance , a less intriguing problem .",
    "normally , the periodicity as such is considered to be the main feature of such systems , whereas the the specific details like the amplitude and the sharpness of corrugation receive less attention . by now",
    ", there has been a number of works on wave propagation in periodically corrugated waveguides ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "many peculiarities of their spectra are studied in more detail .",
    "but in all of the aforesaid papers the particular effective - medium models were used . in spite of the fact that these models allow to take adequately into account the periodicity property",
    ", they were not capable of allowing for other substantial features of the wave scattering by uneven surfaces .",
    "meanwhile , in refs .",
    "@xcite devoted to charge transfer through randomly rough single - mode quantum waveguides it was revealed that the particular role in the transport and spectral properties of such systems was played by the so - called `` slope '' , or `` gradient '' , scattering mechanism , in which as the dominant factor for surface - roughness - induced scattering of propagating waves serves the degree of asperity smoothness .",
    "the same scattering mechanism was found to influence radically the spectra of cavity resonators with sharply rough walls  @xcite .",
    "as far as the principal difference between random and deterministic corrugation lies in the difference in correlation lengths , the results of refs .",
    "@xcite suggest quite strong grounds to believe that the gradients of boundary roughness will have a great impact on the properties of periodically corrugated waveguides as well .    to verify this conjecture , in this study we solve the problem of wave transport through the waveguide with periodically corrugated finite - length segment",
    "whose corrugation is thought of as being small in amplitude but arbitrarily large in sharpness . through the application of special operator technique of transverse - mode separation the transport of each of the transverse mode in the waveguide with corrugated insert",
    "is shown to be equivalent to quantum - particle transport through the individual sharply modulated potential barrier whose average magnitude is governed by the degree of asperity sharpness .",
    "the small - scale nature of the asperities makes it possible to operate in the lowest bloch band only , which allows to concentrate the attention on the sharpness - induced scattering leaving the band - forming bragg scattering beyond consideration . within the suggested approach it is revealed that the slight - in - amplitude modulation of the waveguide boundaries , taken to be not extremely smooth , affects significantly the waveguide mode structure . on sharpening the asperities the number of propagating modes reduces substantially , the fast modes turning sequentially , first , into the slow and then into evanescent modes . in such a way",
    "the multimode waveguide can be made single - mode or even evanescent - mode one without noticeable variation of its local width .",

    "the effective potential @xmath42 has appeared whose effect on the waveguide spectrum is not necessarily small . from the functional structure of this potential",
    "one can infer that within the framework of our theory the intermode scattering reduces to the trial mode intermixing , which is implemented by operator @xmath123 in eq .  .",
    "to analyze the intermode scattering in the arbitrary order of intermode potentials , with regard for the potential complex structure , is a rather difficult task .",
    "this can be accomplished efficiently only in the limiting cases of weak and strong trial mode intermixing .",
    "the intensity of the intermode scattering may be quantified by the operator @xmath123 norm , depending on whose value we may scrutinize both of the above indicated limits by expanding the @xmath50-potential in an appropriate manner .    in appendix",

    "it is shown that with the chosen waveguide parameters , specifically , if the length of the corrugated segment exceeds considerably both the wavelength and corrugation period ( @xmath124 ) , while the parameter @xmath67 does not exceed its critical value  @xmath125 , the operator @xmath34 norm appears to have , for the most part , very large values , @xmath126 .",
    "it only assumes small values , as compared to unity , when either the corrugation is extremely smooth , so that @xmath127 , or if parameter @xmath67 has overcritical values , where the corrugated segment of the waveguide becomes the evanescent - mode one .",
    "however , in the dominant range of parameters , including the case where the corrugation is rather smooth ( @xmath128 ) , the inequality holds @xmath129 , as is exemplified in fig .",

    "considering the intermode potentials in eq .   for @xmath126 results in the twofold reduction of the amplitude of the wave excited by a given source in comparison to the amplitude of the wave we have chosen as the trial one .",
    "interestingly , although the intermode scattering in the system of our study is , chiefly , strong this should not have a strong impact upon the spectra of signals transmitted across the corrugated waveguide segment .",
    "as seen from relation , at large operator @xmath34 norms for propagator @xmath137 with @xmath57 the operator ( in @xmath16 coordinate ) expression is valid @xmath138 from eq .",
    "it follows that if the waveguide is excited by the mode which is not of beyond - cutoff nature for corrugated segment , at the output of this segment the mode should be basically registered of the same mode index .",
    "the other modes should have small amplitudes at the exit of the corrugated region , in spite of the high - level intermode scattering within it .",
    "although this conclusion seems to be unexpected at first sight , it is fully consistent with the data obtained , e.g. , by vellekoop and mosk @xcite in their studies of wave propagation through waveguides with a variable level of inhomogeneity , as well as with qualitative explanation of their results suggested later on in ref .",
    "the above consideration suggests that regardless of the corrugation - induced intermode scattering being weak or strong , the spectrum of the corrugated waveguide is mainly determined by the set of _ trial _ mode green functions , i.e. , it can be with good accuracy approximated by the entire set of bloch wave numbers ,  @xmath100 . for corrugated waveguide walls , the dependence of these wavenumbers on frequency @xmath139 bears the same qualitative character as for the ideally straight - wall waveguide . yet",
    ", there is a number of essential differences between waveguides with straight and corrugated boundaries .",
    "one of the differences we have revealed is that the cutoff frequencies of the corrugated waveguide exceed the corresponding frequencies of the waveguide with straight walls .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where brillouin diagrams resulting from our formulas are presented for three different modes of the corrugated and the corresponding non - corrugated waveguide .",
    "besides , even small - amplitude corrugation of the waveguide walls has a noticeable effect upon the density of its cut - off frequency spectrum . without corrugation , the set of these frequencies is equidistant in mode numbers , @xmath140 . if corrugation is present , the equidistance is violated and the interval between the neighboring cut - off frequencies increases with a growth in the corrugation sharpness .",
    "this is    clearly evident from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , where the relative interval between neighboring cut - off frequencies is depicted , namely , @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the @xmath22-th mode cut - off frequency for the corrugated waveguide .",
    "one can see from the graphs that the spectrum of modes propagating in the waveguide with corrugated walls is considerably rarefied with an increase in the corrugation sharpness , as compared to the similar spectrum of the waveguide of the same average width whose side boundaries are ideally smooth .",
    "the result we have obtained is in conformity with the general claim regarding the normal frequencies of conservative two - dimensional systems @xcite , namely , that the addition of couplings into a dynamical system can only enlarge the intervals between its normal frequencies . in our particular case , this statement turned out to be valid for infinite - dimensional dynamical system , where the role of coupling is played by the level of corrugation .",
    "note that the effect of the cut - off frequency shift to a higher - frequency region was already noted in ref .",
    "yet , it was not appropriately examined therein and no general rules were established .",
    "one more intriguing property of the corrugated waveguide is closely related to the cut - off frequency growth , namely , a decrease in the number of modes that are allowed to pass through the waveguide , as the sharpness of corrugation increases with its amplitude being kept constant . as can be seen from eq .",
    ", a decrease in the number of extended modes with increasing the sharpness parameter @xmath67 may be quite significant , up to the waveguide being entirely `` locked out '' , while the number of modes being allowed to propagate in the non - corrugated regions is reasonably large .",
    "this property may be used for creating the waveguide filters , as it permits quite significant spectral modifications of signals transmitted through artificially corrugated waveguides .",
    "the green function obtained in section [ green_func_calc ] , apart from the spectral properties of the waveguide with corrugated insert , allows for direct calculations of its conducting properties , in particular , of power transmission .",
    "the power radiated by the plane antenna positioned at cross - section @xmath143 and then transferred through cross - section @xmath144 at the point with longitudinal coordinate @xmath16 , being averaged over oscillation period is given by formula @xmath145 here , @xmath146 is the dimensional constant , whose presence relates to the fact that the dimensionality of green function from equation does not meet that of the electric field from maxwell s equations ; @xmath147 is the waveguide dimension along axis @xmath9 , the asterisk denotes complex conjugation . by substituting green function in the form of double series into eq .",
    "we arrive at the expression @xmath148\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the context of our problem the second term in the r.h.s . of eq .   may be omitted .",
    "this is substantiated , first , by the observation that this term does not contain the products of the diagonal mode green functions . as far as the off - diagonal ones are concerned",
    ", we neglect them in view of equality . the additional argument to neglect the second term in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "is the presence of factor @xmath149 , which is exactly zero if the receiver is positioned outside the corrugated region . with allowance for the result",
    "we thus arrive at the following formula for the power transmitted across the corrugated segment of the waveguide , @xmath150 to make a detailed calculations of this power , one should substitute either expression for the trial green function or the transmission coefficient eq .   into formula . in figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] , the power transferred through the corrugated segment of the waveguide is depicted as a function of the normalized frequency and the sharpness parameter ,  @xmath67 .",
    "the stepwise form of both of the graphs is related to the addition ( or , correspondingly , cutting - off ) the effective ( gradient - renormalized ) extended modes in the waveguide spectrum , in    accordance with formula  .",
    "however , whereas the steps in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] are the well - known physical fact , the analogous stepwise behavior of the transmitted power as a function of corrugation sharpness , shown in fig .  [ fig10 ] , is predicted therein for the first time .",
    "the oscillations seen on the plateaus in both of the graphs , [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] , are related to bragg resonances in the transmission of the marginal waveguide mode .",
    "to conclude , we formulate the main results obtained in the present paper and give some comments on the exploited calculation technique .",
    "we have developed the theory of wave transmission through the waveguide containing the finite segment with periodically corrugated side boundaries .",
    "such an inhomogeneous insert in the initially unfigured waveguide can have a considerable impact on its spectral properties .",
    "the central role in the modification of the entire waveguide mode structure is played by the sharpness of the insert corrugation . even though the boundary asperities might be of very small amplitude ,",
    "the number of extended modes in the waveguide is substantially reduced when the corrugation is sharpened , reaching zero at some critical value of the governing sharpness parameter .    to solve the problem we have applied the method of oscillation mode separation , which was developed earlier with regard to waveguide - like systems with bulk inhomogeneities . in the present study",
    "we have adjusted this method to waveguides with inhomogeneous boundaries by using thereto the local transverse - mode representation , which makes it possible to present surface inhomogeneity as the bulk one .",
    "the separation of waveguide modes , which is basically equivalent to the separation of variables in the original wave equation , was carried out through the specific operator procedure essentially equivalent to the construction of the perturbation series with regard to the intensity of the intermode scattering . in developing this theory ,",
    "we started from the solution to the auxiliary problem , in which the intermode scattering is formally disregarded while the intramode scattering is taken into account in full .",
    "the application of this procedure has enabled us to find that the intermode scattering induced by the corrugated waveguide segment is normally very strong , resulting actually in the mode system homogenization . in these conditions ,",
    "the spectrum of sharply uneven waveguide is restored to the state were the intermode scattering is entirely absent while the intramode scattering is accounted for .",
    "the actually large strength of the intermode scattering reveals itself in the twofold reduction of the field amplitude in comparison with the case were this scattering is disregarded arbitrarily .    by solving the set of decoupled equations derived using our method , we succeeded in showing that the corrugated segment of the waveguide may be considered ( by analogy with quantum particle transport ) as the modulated potential barrier , whose width is coincident with the actual length of the segment whereas the height is prescribed by the level of corrugation sharpness . inside this sharpness - controlled barrier the field is transferred in a resonant manner by means of the quasi - steady states arising due to the multiple wave reflection from the barrier ends .",
    "the `` external '' waveguide modes falling upon the barrier are mutually re - scattered while passing through it , but at the exit point their arrangement in mode indices is basically restored . as the barrier increases with growing the corrugation sharpness , the propagating modes are successively cut off , though the asperity height is insufficient for this purpose .",
    "the mode cutting - off leads to rarefication of the entire ( combined ) waveguide spectrum , so that at some critical level of the asperity sharpness the waveguide becomes the evanescent - mode one .",
    "another important result of the application of our method is that by using it one can analytically trace the overall dynamics of the propagation constants against the sharpness of boundary corrugation .",
    "although functional dependence of the longitudinal wavenumber on the frequency for both the straight and the corrugated waveguide remains the same , in the presence of corrugation the cut - off frequencies line up non - equidistantly .",
    "the shift of these frequencies to the higher - frequency range grows considerably both with a decrease in the corrugation period and with a mode number increase . the difference between neighboring cut - off frequencies increases as well , so that the waveguide spectrum becomes significantly more sparse .",
    "the non - equidistance of the cut - off frequency set may be utilized in practice to achieve the single - frequency mode in microwave amplifiers , in developing the waveguide - based filters for complex signals , as well as for narrow - band generators with bragg reflectors . in such generators",
    ", the amplification curve normally has finite width .",
    "therefore , in order to prevent the given mode interaction with higher modes it is necessary that they do not fall into the amplification band . at the same time , the operating mode frequency , at which the output - input ratio reaches a maximal value , is situated at a relative distance of approximately 1/4 from the amplification curve lower bound .",
    "so , it is quite desirable for the cut - off frequencies to be shifted disproportionately to mode numbers .",
    "according to the standard definition of the operator norm @xcite , we have to calculate the quantity @xmath151 where trial functions @xmath152 must belong to the functional space where operator @xmath123 is active .",
    "the domain of definition of this operator , as shown in sec .",
    "[ modesep ] , is the coordinate - mode space , so the result of its action on some scalar function ( in particular , on the single component of a vector function ) is a vector .",
    "the support of potentials is the segment @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , it is exactly this particular segment that we will consider as the support for the entire set of trial functions in eq .  .",
    "the finite - support functions are fourier - expandable , so in the capacity of trial functions in the definition eq .",
    "it is reasonable to use the set of exponential functions @xmath154 .",
    "the compactness of the support for the latter functions may be ensured by choosing the integration contour for fourier integrals to be not the exacly real axis , @xmath155 , but rather the horizontal line in the plane of the complex variable ( @xmath156 ) properly offset to the upper or lower half - plane , e.g. , @xmath157 .",
    "it is convenient to proceed with the norm calculation in the selected class of functions not for the operator itself @xmath158 but rather for its transposed counterpart , where operators @xmath159 and @xmath160 are rearranged . considering that the norm squared of the chosen trial function is of the order of @xmath0 , we actually need to estimate ( by an order of magnitude ) the expression @xmath161 the potential @xmath162 , see eq .",
    ", does not modulo exceed the average potential @xmath163 .",
    "hence , we can simplify the integrand in eq .   by setting all the factors @xmath164 in expression and replacing the quantity @xmath100 in the exponentials by the wavenumber @xmath165 .",
    "the reflection coefficient is not modulo larger than unity ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] ) , so instead of exact expression we will use in what follows its truncated version , namely , @xmath166 with this expression , only two first terms in eq .",
    "are actually allowed for , whose amplitude factors are @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "in addition , in the right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "and we retain the terms without the factors of @xmath112 , bearing in mind that the order - of - magnitude estimation only is of importance .",
    "all the unrecorded terms contribute to the norm additively with function , so they can not affect significantly the estimates obtained below .    as far as the intermode potentials in eq .",
    "are concerned , their expression contains two functionally different terms ( with zero and non - zero average value ) .",
    "we will consider their contribution to the mode - mixing operator norm separately .",
    "the contribution of the first , quadratic in @xmath169 term , after the function being represented in terms of the fourier integral , is written as      here , the integral over @xmath16 is calculated without difficulty if the length @xmath0 is sufficiently large .",
    "specifically , when @xmath171 this integral may be thought of as the prelimit @xmath172-function , @xmath173{}2\\pi\\delta(\\kappa)\\ .\\ ] ] computing then the remaining integrals in eq .   and taking into account that the major contribution to the sums over @xmath174 and @xmath175 comes from the terms with the extended - type trial green functions , we arrive at the estimate @xmath176 the contribution to norm of the second , linear in @xmath169 term of potential is calculated in a similar manner , and the estimate of this contribution reads @xmath177 by comparing the right - hand sides of eqs .   and one can reveal that their ratio equals to the value of @xmath178",
    ". under the conditions suggested by inequalities eq .  , this parameter is greater than unity , so the result may be reckoned as the final estimate of the operator @xmath123 norm in the slope parameter region @xmath101 , where the intermode scattering is ensured by extended modes . in the region",
    "@xmath102 all the trial modes become evanescent , so it does not make any sense to take account of their mutual intermode scattering .",
    "expressions and are coincident with transmission and reflection factors obtained by ignatovich ref .",
    "@xcite , who studied the mathematical aspects of wave propagation in periodic potentials with finite number of periods .",
    "the analogous transmittance oscillations are well known in the theory of wave propagation through finite periodic structures ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . yet , in our case the appearance of these oscillations is not directly related to the corrugation periodicity and to the formation of different bloch spectral bands . in our theory , the resonances in the transparency arise when new effective ( gradient - renormalized ) extended mode is opened in the corrugated segment and , depending on the length of the segment , the conditions for the formation of the quasi - bound states of bragg nature inside it are realized .",
    "the density of the transmission resonances on the frequency axis is growing rapidly with increase in the length of the corrugated segment .",
    "thus , in the experiments this may be taken merely as the transmission curve `` spreading '' near each of the cut - off frequencies ."
