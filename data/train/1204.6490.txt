    "the purpose of this work is to demonstrate that the noncommutative kubo formula @xcite for the transport coefficients of aperiodic solids in magnetic fields can be efficiently evaluated on a computer .",
    "our main message is that the noncommutative kubo formula , which is now well known for its pivotal role in the theoretical foundation of charge transport in aperiodic systems @xcite , can also provide an effective numerical solution to the difficult problem of computing the transport coefficients for realistic quantum models of aperiodic systems . for disordered quantum lattice systems in magnetic fields , we derive a  canonical \" finite - volume approximation to the noncommutative kubo formula that can be efficiently evaluated on a computer .",
    "the advantage of this approximate formula is that it does not require twisted boundary conditions and integration over a brillouin torus but only one ( periodic- ) boundary condition , and yet the convergence to its thermodynamic limit , which is the exact noncommutative kubo formula , happens exponentially fast .",
    "the transport measurements have always been regarded as fine tools for probing and understanding the physical properties of solids but there have been particular times in solid state research when the transport measurements have taken the central stage .",
    "this was certainly the case when the integer @xcite and fractional @xcite quantum hall effects were discovered , or when the quasicrystals were discovered @xcite .",
    "the recent discovery of the topological insulators @xcite has brought again the transport measurements to the central stage .",
    "these materials are postulated to have non - vanishing transport coefficients even in the presence of strong disorder .",
    "a concentrated experimental effort towards proving this principle has generated an incredible amount of fine transport data for these materials .",
    "however , the goal has not been achieved yet , despite of several years of progress in sample preparation and characterization . as such",
    ", there is an urgent need to  reverse engineer \" the available experimental transport data to get a better understanding of the microscopic structure of the samples .",
    "this is contingent on our ability to simulate the quantum transport for disordered materials in the presence of magnetic fields , based on microscopic quantum models . even though we do not present any simulations for topological insulators , we wanted to bring the subject into the reader s attention because this was the primary motivation behind our effort .",
    "simulations for topological insulators , using the formalism developed in this work , are reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the noncommutative kubo formula for aperiodic systems appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the context was that of the integer quantum hall effect .",
    "it played a crucial role in explaining this effect . in the same reference",
    ", the authors derived the zero temperature limit of the hall conductivity and linked it to the noncommutative chern invariant . in the past several years , we have evaluated the noncommutative chern invariant on a computer for several disordered quantum lattice models @xcite .",
    "these simulations revealed to us the extraordinary efficiency of this formula , which enabled us to compute this invariant for extremely large system sizes .",
    "we were also impressed with the accuracy of the approach for the quantization of the chern invariant was observed to occur with better than five digits of precision ( in the presence of strong disorder ! ) , whenever the simulation box exceeded the localization length of the system .",
    "the results mentioned above stimulated our interest in the finite temperature noncommutative kubo formula for charge transport .",
    "as it is always the case , on a computer we can only simulate finite systems .",
    "the noncommutative kubo formula has earned many accolades , among which the fact that it explicitly tells us what the thermodynamic limit of the linear conductivity is . however , from a computational point of view , this formulation in the thermodynamic limit presents a major difficulty because many elements appearing in this formula do not have a canonical equivalent at finite volumes .",
    "this brings up a more general question , namely , how to accurately compute correlation functions for aperiodic systems on a finite volume ?",
    "by correlation function we mean the expected values of products of observables .",
    "the solution to the above question can be constructed in a @xmath0-algebraic setting .",
    "for this , we developed the concept of approximating @xmath0-algebras , which are simplified versions of some  exact \" @xmath0-algebras , with the essential requirement that approximate morphisms can be established between the exact and the approximating structures .",
    "these approximate morphisms can be used to transfer the correlation functions from the exact algebra to the approximate one and to ultimately compute the error bounds for this approximation process .",
    "our strategy will be to apply the concept of approximating algebras in two steps as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ approxdiagram ] .",
    "the exact @xmath0-algebra is that of the observables defined in the presence of a uniform magnetic field ( described by the antisymmetric tensor @xmath1 ) on the entire @xmath2 lattice and on the entire disorder configuration space @xmath3 : @xmath4 .",
    "the first approximating algebra is that of the observables defined on the entire lattice but only on those disorder configurations leading to periodic potentials with a repeating cell @xmath5 : @xmath6 .",
    "the differential calculus transfers automatically over @xmath6 but a new trace is required . for the second step",
    ", @xmath6 becomes the exact algebra and the approximating algebra is that of the observables defined on a real - space torus of volume @xmath5 and on a specific disorder configuration space @xmath7 : @xmath8 .",
    "for the latter algebra we need to define an approximate differential calculus and a new trace .",
    "the approximate morphisms provide a canonical way to approximate the correlation functions , in particular , the non - commutative kubo formula . for both approximating steps",
    ", we derive explicit error bounds on the finite - volume approximate kubo formula and establish that the errors vanish exponentially fast as @xmath5 is taken to infinity .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the quantum lattice models for electrons in solids and we argue that , as long as one is interested in the linear response regime , these models should not be taken as some crude approximation of the physical reality , but rather as accurate representations of it , with a systematic way of improving the accuracy . in section 2",
    "we also introduce an explicit model that will be used throughout the paper .    in sections 3 and 4",
    "we review the noncommutative theory of charge transport in aperiodic solids developed by bellissard , schulz - baldes and their collaborators @xcite , touching only on the essential points .",
    "the interested reader can consult the comprehensive lecture notes by bellissard @xcite for a detailed exposition of the subject .",
    "section 3 introduces the noncommutative @xmath0-algebra of the observables for a disordered electron gas in a magnetic field , and gives a short discussion of the functional calculus for @xmath0-algebras .",
    "it also introduces the noncommutative differential and integral calculus on this @xmath0-algebra .",
    "together , these structures extend the notion of brillouin torus to that of a noncommutative manifold , the famous noncommutative brillouin torus @xcite .",
    "section 4 reviews the basics of the noncommutative theory of electron transport and gives the derivation of the noncommutative kubo formula . in both section 3 and section 4",
    "we follow closely the work of bellissard , schulz - baldes and their collaborators @xcite .",
    "section 5 develops the combes - thomas technique @xcite for the noncommutative brillouin torus .",
    "this technique , which is well known to the analysts working with the schedinger equation , will allow us to derive general and explicit exponential localization estimates for the analytic functional calculus with short - range observables .",

    "it then presents the comparative estimates for the algebras @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "section 7 introduces the @xmath0-algebra @xmath8 over the torus .",
    "it also defines the noncommutative integral calculus and an approximate noncommutative differential calculus for this algebra .",
    "it then presents the comparative estimates for the algebras @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "section 8 introduces the approximate noncommutative kubo formula on the torus and derives the error estimates , which are shown to vanish exponentially fast in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "section 8 also discusses the numerical implementation of the approximate noncommutative kubo formula .",
    "section 9 presents a numerical application to the integer quantum hall effect and section 10 summarizes the main results of our work .",
    "the hilbert space of a generic quantum lattice model is spanned by vectors of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a node of the lattice and @xmath11 is a label for the orbitals associated with that node .",
    "the scalar product @xmath12 is by definition such that @xmath13 .",
    "intuitively , one can think of @xmath9 as the atomic orbitals of the elements present in the @xmath14-th repeating cell of a material .",
    "formally , the vectors @xmath9 can be viewed as the standard basis for the @xmath15 space .    in the modern electronic structure theory ,",
    "the quantum lattice models emerge as  low energy \" approximations of the continuum quantum models .",
    "for perfectly periodic solids , there is a standard machinery for generating such lattice models from continuum models . in short ,",
    "the construction starts from an effective hamiltonian @xmath16 which describes the equilibrium many - body state of the electrons in a material .",
    "a relevant spectral domain of @xmath16 is identified , usually by defining an energy cut - off , and the subspace corresponding to this spectral domain is represented in the so called maximally localized wannier basis functions @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the number of wannier functions per repeating cell depends on the number of atoms present in the repeating cell and on the energy cut - off .",
    "the vectors @xmath9 , @xmath18 , now represent the wannier functions centered inside the @xmath14-th repeating cell and the lattice hamiltonian is simply : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the scalar product of the continuum model .",
    "the above lattice hamiltonian , although quadratic , it already incorporates interaction effects through @xmath16 , which is tuned to exactly reproduce certain many - electron properties , such as the electron density for the case of the widely used density functional theory @xcite .",
    "the interaction effects , not accounted for already , are incorporated in the transport theory through the dissipation operator , to be discussed in section 4 .",
    "the individual terms inside the sums in eq .",
    "[ latticeham ] are called hoppings , and the matrix elements @xmath21 the hopping amplitudes .",
    "generically , the maximally localized wannier functions have a rapid spatial decay so the lattice hamiltonians usually contain only a finite number of hopping terms between one lattice node and the rest of the nodes .",
    "it is quite often the case that just the hoppings between the nearest neighboring cells provide a reasonably accurate representation .",
    "if this is the case , we will use the terminology  nearest - neighbor hopping hamiltonian . \"",
    "another important observation is that the lattice hamiltonian reproduces exactly the band spectrum of the continuum hamiltonian @xmath16 , below the energy cut - off .",
    "furthermore , the coupling integrals with the external driving fields can be exactly computed for the wannier representation and even a lattice representation of a realistic disorder can be generated @xcite .",
    "the main point of these observations is that we have a standard procedure to generate lattice models for periodic or disordered solids in external fields , whose accuracies can be systematically improved .",
    "of course , the above statement is valid in the linear response regime where the representation based on the equilibrium wannier functions makes sense .",
    "several versions of this procedure are already implemented in the quantum - espresso @xcite first principle electronic structure calculations package , and applications to electron transport in molecular structures have already appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of the present work , namely , that there is a canonical way to construct exponentially fast converging finite - volume approximations of the finite - temperature linear response coefficients , applies to a large class of disordered quantum lattice models .",
    "the essential characteristics of these models are : 1 ) existence of a triplet ( a classical dynamical system ) @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a compact metrizable probability space and @xmath24 an ergodic , probability preserving action of the @xmath2 group on @xmath3 , and 2 ) existence of a bounded family of lattice hamiltonians @xmath25 indexed by the points of @xmath3 , with the property of being covariant : @xmath26 .",
    "here @xmath27 represents the magnetic translation by @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "however , in order to build our final arguments , we will need to fully identify all the constants and the parameters appearing in our error bounds .",
    "for this reason , we decided to simplify the exposition by working with a specific lattice model .",
    "this model has just one orbital per node and , with disorder and magnetic field , the hamiltonian of the model reads : @xmath29 the phase factor @xmath30 encodes the effect of the magnetic field through the peierls substitution @xcite .",
    "its specific form will be discussed in section 3 .",
    "note that , in a short range isotropic model , all the hopping amplitudes must be equal in the absence of the magnetic field , in which case they can be set to unity like in eq .",
    "[ mainmodel0 ] by choosing appropriate energy units .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "[ mainmodel0 ] : @xmath31 represents the disorder potential .",
    "this is just a simplified but very popular representation of the real effect of disorder in a solid .",
    "we will assume the amplitudes @xmath32 to be independent random variables uniformly distributed within the interval @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the collection of amplitudes @xmath34 can be viewed as a point @xmath35 in the space @xmath36^{\\mathbb{z}^d}$ ] .",
    "it is now quite standard @xcite that @xmath3 is a compact metrizable space , which accepts the following probability measure : @xmath37 there is a natural action of the additive @xmath2 discrete group on @xmath3 : @xmath38 which is ergodic and leaves the measure @xmath39 invariant .",
    "hence , the model of eq .",
    "[ mainmodel0 ] gives a concrete representation of the generic quantum systems mentioned in the lines above .",
    "in the heisenberg s picture of quantum mechanics , the central objects are the observables , which are represented as elements of specific algebras .",
    "the main shift from the schroedinger picture is the focus on the relations between the observables themselves , rather than on how the observables act on the wave functions . as such",

    "[ [ section ] ]    the hamiltonian and its spatial translates generate an algebra @xmath40 , which in some sense is the smallest ( and therefore the most useful ) space to carry the calculations in .",
    "it contains all the observables of interest and it provides just the right framework to compute the correlation functions at finite temperatures .",
    "our first goal is to describe this algebra .",
    "the effect of a uniform magnetic field in a @xmath41-dimensional lattice model is captured entirely by a @xmath42 antisymmetric matrix @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "for example , in 2-dimensions , @xmath43 is equal to the magnetic flux through the repeating cell .",
    "our units will be chosen such that the magnetic flux is expressed in the units of magnetic flux quantum of @xmath44 .",
    "also , we will use the notation @xmath45 as a shorthand for @xmath46 .",

    "any short - range hamiltonian can be generated from an element residing inside this algebra .",
