    "<S> in this paper joint multifractal random walk approach is carried out to analyze some petrophysical quantities for characterizing the petroleum reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities include gamma emission ( gr ) , sonic transient time ( dt ) and neutron porosity ( nphi ) which are collected from four wells of a reservoir . to quantify mutual interaction of petrophysical quantities , joint multifractal random walk is implemented . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is based on the mutual multiplicative cascade notion in the multifractal formalism and in this approach @xmath0 represents a benchmark to describe the nature of cross - correlation between two series . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the petrophysical quantities revealed that gr for all wells has strongly multifractal nature due to the considerable abundance of large fluctuations in various scales . </S>",
    "<S> the variance of probability distribution function , @xmath1 , at scale @xmath2 and its intercept determine the multifractal properties of the data sets sourced by probability density function . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath3 for nphi data set is less than gr s , however , dt shows a nearly monofractal behavior , namely @xmath4 , so we find that @xmath5 . while , the value of hurst exponents can not discriminate between series gr , nphi and dt . </S>",
    "<S> joint analysis of the petrophysical quantities for considered wells demonstrates that @xmath0 has negative value for gr - nphi confirming that finding shaly layers is in competition with finding porous medium while it takes positive value for gr - dt determining that continuum medium can be detectable by evaluating the statistical properties of gr and its cross - correlation to dt signal . + </S>",
