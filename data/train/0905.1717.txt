    "one of the most important questions in modern cosmology is to understand how the first stars , the so - called population  iii ( pop  iii ) , ended the cosmic dark ages at redshifts @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "their emergence led to a fundamental transformation in the early universe , from its simple initial state to one of ever - increasing complexity .",
    "the emission from the hot , @xmath3 , photospheres of pop  iii stars began the reionization of primordial hydrogen and helium in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , although this process was completed only later on , when more massive galaxies formed @xcite .",
    "in addition , the supernova explosions that ended the lives of massive pop  iii stars distributed the first heavy elements into the igm @xcite .",
    "this latter process might have had a significant impact on the physics of early star formation , as metal - enriched gas can cool more efficiently than primordial gas @xcite .    based on numerical simulations",
    ", a general consensus has emerged that the first stars formed in dark matter minihaloes at @xmath4 , in isolation or at most as a small stellar multiple , and with typical masses of @xmath5 ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "it is crucial to observationally test this key prediction .",
    "however , it has become evident that this will be very challenging .",
    "even the exquisite near - ir ( @xmath6 ) sensitivity of the upcoming _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ will not suffice to directly image such massive , single pop  iii stars @xcite , unless they explode as energetic pair - instability supernovae @xcite .",
    "the direct spectroscopic detection of recombination line emission from the h  ii region surrounding the pop  iii star , as well as from the relic h  ii region left behind once the star had died , is beyond the capability of _ jwst _ as well , although such line emission might be detectable from primordial stellar populations inside more massive host haloes @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to search for the global signature from many pop  iii stars that formed in minihaloes over large cosmic volumes @xcite .",
    "one such probe is the optical depth to thomson scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons off free electrons along the line of sight , determined by the five - year _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) _ measurement to be @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this signal , however , is dominated by ionizing sources that must have formed closer to the end of reionization , with only a small contribution from pop  iii stars formed in minihaloes @xcite .",
    "a second empirical signature is the combined bremsstrahlung emission from the h  ii regions in their active and relic states around those minihaloes that hosted pop  iii stars .",
    "the resulting free - free radio emission leads to spectral distortions that might be detectable in the rayleigh - jeans part of the cmb spectrum .",
    "recently , the arcade  2 experiment has attempted to measure such a free - free contribution from the epoch of the first stars @xcite .",
    "the surprisingly strong signal found , however , can not originate in early pop  iii stars , and in any case would overwhelm the much weaker contribution from the first stars and galaxies @xcite .",
    "the most promising detection strategy might be to scrutinize the background from the redshifted 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen @xcite .",
    "once the central pop  iii star has died , the relic h  ii region left behind would provide a bright source of 21-cm emission @xcite .",
    "again , individual sources are much too weak to leave a detectable imprint , but the planned square kilometer array ( ska ) might be able to detect the cumulative signal @xcite .",
    "we here carry out radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the evolution of h  ii regions around massive pop  iii stars in minihaloes , giving us a detailed understanding of the properties of individual sources .",
    "we combine this with an approximate , press - schechter type analysis of the cosmological number density of minihaloes as a function of redshift to derive the observational signature of the first h  ii regions as well as relic h  ii regions , where we specifically focus on the free - free and 21-cm probes .",
    "we note that we do not include the feedback effects exerted by black holes or supernovae , which are possible end products of massive pop  iii stars @xcite . in this sense",
    ", we organize our work as follows . in section  2",
    ", we describe the simulation setup and our implementation of the radiative transfer scheme in the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget-2 @xcite . in section  3 ,",
    "we discuss the properties of the first h  ii regions in their active as well as relic states and their observational signature in terms of recombination radiation , bremsstrahlung and 21-cm emission .",
    "finally , in section  4 we summarize our results and assess their implications .",
    "for consistency , all quoted distances are physical , unless noted otherwise .",
    "our treatment of ionizing and photodissociating radiation emitted by massive pop  iii stars is very similar to the methodology introduced in @xcite and @xcite , with the exception that we here take the hydrodynamical response into account , self - consistently coupled to the chemical and thermal evolution of the gas .",
    "this allows us to model dense ( d - type ) as well as rarefied ( r - type ) ionization fronts , which is crucial for a proper treatment of the breakout of ionizing radiation . in the following ,",
    "we describe our simulation setup , as well as the numerical implementation of the ray - tracing algorithm .",
    "we perform our simulations in a cosmological box with linear size @xmath8 ( comoving ) , and @xmath9 particles per species , corresponding to a particle mass of @xmath10 for dark matter and @xmath11 for gas .",
    "the simulations are initialized at @xmath12 with a fluctuation power spectrum determined by a @xmath13 cold dark matter ( @xmath13cdm ) cosmology with matter density @xmath14 , baryon density @xmath15 , hubble parameter @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the hubble expansion rate today , and spectral index @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we use an artificially high fluctuation power of @xmath19 to accelerate structure formation in our relatively small box , although the cosmological mean is given by @xmath20 .",
    "we take the chemical evolution of the gas into account by following the abundances of h , h@xmath21 , h@xmath22 , h@xmath23 , h@xmath24 , he , he@xmath21 , he@xmath25 , and e@xmath22 , as well as the three deuterium species d , d@xmath21 , and hd . we include all relevant cooling mechanisms , i.e. h and he collisional ionization , excitation and recombination cooling , bremsstrahlung , inverse compton cooling , and collisional excitation cooling via h@xmath23 and hd @xcite .",
    "we explicitly include h@xmath23 cooling via collisions with protons and electrons , which is important for the chemical and thermal evolution of relic h  ii region gas @xcite .",
    "we run the simulations until the first minihalo in the box has collapsed to a density of @xmath26 , at which point the gas has cooled to @xmath27 and becomes jeans - unstable @xcite .",
    "the first halo that fulfils this criterion collapses at @xmath28 and has a virial mass of @xmath29 and a virial radius of @xmath30 . highly resolved simulations have shown that at later times , the gas condenses further under the influence of self - gravity to @xmath31 , where it becomes optically thick and forms a protostellar seed @xcite . due to its residual angular momentum ,",
    "the central clump flattens and likely evolves into an accretion disk . in our case , we find a flattened structure already at a density of @xmath26 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "subsequently , the star grows to as massive as @xmath32 within its lifetime of a few million years @xcite .",
    "however , we note that under certain conditions the disk may fragment to form multiple objects of smaller masses @xcite . unfortunately , the details of the accretion phase and the concomitant radiative feedback are poorly understood , although some analytic investigations have been carried out @xcite . under these circumstances",
    ", it seems best to initialize the calculation of the h  ii region at the onset of the initial jeans - instability , when the density exceeds @xmath26 .",
    "the procedure used to calculate the strmgren sphere around the star for a given time - step @xmath33 is similar to the ray - tracing scheme used in @xcite .",
    "we first designate an individual sph particle as the source of ionizing radiation and create a spherical grid with typically @xmath34 rays and @xmath35 logarithmically spaced radial bins around the source particle .",
    "the minimum radius is set by the smoothing length of the central particle , while the maximum radius is chosen appropriately to encompass the entire h  ii region .",
    "this approach may seem crude compared to existing methods that use adaptive grids ( e.g. healpix ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the increased angular and radial resolution towards the center tend to mirror the existing density profile .",
    "however , one must proceed with care if the ionization front encounters dense clumps far from the source , where the resolution may no longer be sufficient .    in a single , parallel loop",
    ", the cartesian coordinates of all particles are converted to spherical coordinates , such that their density and chemical abundances are mapped to the bins corresponding to their radius , zenith angle and azimuth , denoted by @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . the volume of each particle is approximately given by @xmath39 , which transforms to @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "if the volume element of a particle intersects with the volume element of a bin , the particle contributes to the bin proportional to the density of the particle squared .",
    "this dependency ensures that overdense regions are not missed if the bin size is much larger than the smoothing length , which could occur far from the source where the grid resolution is poor .",
    "accidental flash - ionization of minihaloes is thus avoided . once the above steps are complete , it is straightforward to solve the ionization front equation along each ray : @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the position of the ionization front , @xmath45 the number of ionizing photons emitted per second , @xmath46 the case b recombination coefficient , and @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 the number densities of neutral particles , electrons and positively charged ions , respectively .",
    "we assume that the recombination coefficient remains constant at its value for @xmath50 , which is roughly the temperature of the h  ii and he  iii region .",
    "the numbers of h  i / he  i and he  ii ionizing photons are given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 from now on denotes planck s constant , @xmath53 denotes boltzmann s constant , and @xmath54 is the minimum frequency corresponding to the ionization threshold of h  i and he  ii . we assume that massive pop  iii stars emit a blackbody spectrum @xmath55 ( in @xmath56 ) with an effective temperature @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and luminosity @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 for a @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 star , respectively @xcite .",

    "the lifetimes of the stars are given by @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "we neglect the effects of stellar evolution , which might lead to a decrease of the number of ionizing photons emitted at the end of the main sequence @xcite , although recent investigations have shown that rotating pop  iii stars remain on bluer evolutionary tracks and this effect might not be so strong @xcite .    to obtain a discretisation of the ionization front equation",
    ", we replace the integral on the right - hand side of equation  ( 1 ) by a discrete sum : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the radial extent of bin @xmath73 , and the sum extends from the origin to the position of the ionization front at the end of the current time - step @xmath33 .",
    "the above equation describes the advancement of the ionization front due to an excess of ionizing photons compared to recombinations .",
    "similarly , the left - hand side of equation  ( 1 ) , which models the propagation of the ionization front into neutral gas , is discretized by @xmath74 where the sum now extends from the position of the ionization front at the previous time - step to its position at the end of the current time - step .",
    "we perform the above steps separately for the h  ii and he  iii region , since they require distinct heating and ionization rates . for the he  iii region ,",
    "we replace the quantities @xmath47 and @xmath49 in equation  ( 1 ) with @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the number density of species @xmath78 relative to @xmath79 .",
    "we adopt a case b recombination rate of @xmath80 for he  iii recombinations to he  ii @xcite .",
    "applying the same prescription to the h  ii region , we find @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "similarly , we adopt a case b recombination rate of @xmath83 for hydrogen and helium recombinations from their first ionized states to the ground state @xcite .",
    "we initialize the calculation of the h  ii region at the boundary of the he  iii region , since hydrogen and helium are maintained in their first ionization states by recombinations of he  iii to he  ii @xcite .",
    "we note that the exact position of the ionization front is not restricted to integer multiples of our pre - defined radial bins , but may instead lie anywhere in between . for this purpose",
    "we adopt a simple linear scaling of the number of ionizations and recombinations as a function of the relative position of the ionization front .",
    "the most expensive step in terms of computing time is the assignment of the density and the chemical abundances to the grid , while the ray - tracing itself requires only a negligible amount of time .",
    "once the extent of the h  ii and he  iii region have been determined , the sph particles within these regions are assigned an additional variable that stores their distance from the source .",
    "this information is then passed to the chemistry solver , which determines the ionization and heating rates , given by @xmath84 and @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 denote the incoming specific flux and ionization cross section , respectively . for the case of a blackbody , @xmath88 where @xmath36 is the distance from the source .",

    "these are taken into account every time - step , while the ray - tracing is performed only every fifth time - step . since the hydrodynamic time - step is generally limited to one - twentieth of the sound - crossing time through the kernel ,",
    "our treatment of the coupled evolution of the ionization front and the hydrodynamic shock is roughly correct .",
    "the computational cost of runs with and without ray - tracing are typically within a factor of a few .      the final ingredient in our algorithm is the inclusion of molecule - dissociating radiation .",
    "this effect turns out to be of only minor importance in the present study , but will render our algorithm capable of addressing a general set of early universe applications .",
    "molecular hydrogen is the most important coolant in low - temperature , primordial gas , but is easily destroyed by radiation in the lyman - werner ( lw ) bands between @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the small residual h@xmath23 fraction in the igm leads to a very small optical depth over cosmological distances , such that even a small background can have a significant effect @xcite . in our implementation",
    ", we do not take self - shielding into account , which becomes important for h@xmath23 column densities @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "such a high column density is difficult to achieve in minihaloes , and is more likely to occur within the virial radius of the first galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the onset of turbulence in the first galaxies likely leads to a reduction of self - shielding via doppler shifting @xcite .",
    "for this reason we treat the photodissociation of h@xmath23 in the optically thin limit , such that the dissociation rate in a volume limited by causality to a radius @xmath98 is given by @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the integral of the specific flux @xmath86 over the lw bands , resulting in @xmath101\\times 10^{-7}}{\\left(r/{\\rm pc}\\right)^{2}}~{\\rm s}^{-1}\\ ] ] for a @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 pop  iii star , respectively .",
    "we equate the photodissociation rate of hydrogen deuteride to that of molecular hydrogen . in the present work",
    ", we do not explicitly include photodetachment of h@xmath22 and photodissociation of h@xmath102 , which might be problematic outside of the h  ii region , where molecules survive collisional destruction .",
    "however , in the context discussed here , this caveat is not important ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in the following , we discuss the direct observational signature of the first h  ii regions and relic h  ii regions in terms of recombination radiation , as well as their indirect signature in terms of a global radio background produced by bremsstrahlung and 21-cm emission .",
    "the build - up of the first h  ii regions by pop  iii stars in minihaloes was treated in one dimension by @xcite and @xcite , and in three dimensions by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter also treated the build - up of a smaller he  iii region , which is created by the very hard spectrum of massive pop  iii stars .",
    "the consensus was that recombinations initially balanced ionizations within the virial radius of the host halo , leading to the formation of a d - type ionization front .",
    "breakout occured after the density dropped sufficiently for the ionization front to race ahead of the hydrodynamic shock , becoming r - type .",
    "the hydrodynamic response of the gas is self - similar , since minihaloes approximately resemble singular isothermal spheres @xcite .",
    "the relevant parameters are set by the temperature of the singular isothermal sphere and the h  ii region , which in our case are @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .    in fig .  2",
    ", we compare the density profile of the @xcite solution to the simulation for the case of a @xmath105 pop  iii star .",
    "interestingly , we find a clear deviation from the ideal , spherically symmetric solution already during the d - type phase , which is caused by the anisotropic collapse of the minihalo .",
    "due to angular momentum conservation , the gas spins up and forms a flattened , disk - like structure at a density of @xmath106 , which can be seen in the right panel of fig .  1 , and in the left panel of fig .  2 , where it is evident that the density dispersion is almost an order of magnitude within the central @xmath107",
    "in response to this anisotropy , which is further amplified by the density - squared dependence of recombinations , the ionization front first breaks out perpendicular to the disk , where the column density is lowest . this is visible in the left and middle panels of fig .  3 , as well as in fig .  2 , where the @xcite solution is approximately reproduced perpendicular to the disk , while the plane of the disk remains neutral and dense . once the ionization front becomes r - type , spherical symmetry",
    "is asymptotically restored and the h  ii region expands to @xmath108 , @xmath69 and @xmath109 for the @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 pop  iii star , respectively .",
    "we find that he  ii ionizing photons within the he  iii region increase the central temperature by a factor of @xmath110 , leaving only a small imprint on the dynamical evolution of the h  ii region ( see * ? ? ?",
    "however , the he  ii @xmath111 recombination line within the he  iii region may be used as a distinct probe for the presence of massive pop  iii stars @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we use the results obtained in this section to determine the recombination signature of the first h  ii and he  iii regions in their active as well as relic states .",
    "the strongest direct signature of the first h  ii and he  iii regions is likely generated by recombination radiation , since ionizing photons are absorbed by dense gas in the host halo .",
    "we here concentrate on the h@xmath112 and he  ii @xmath111 lines , since more energetic photons photons are scattered out of resonance by the neutral igm , creating extended haloes around high - redshift sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting fluxes may then be compared to the expected sensitivity of the mid - infrared instrument ( miri ) on _ jwst _ at @xmath113 wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the spatial resolution is limited by diffraction , such that a scale of @xmath114 at @xmath115 is marginally resolved , which allows us to approximate the region of emission as a point source .",

    "it is noteworthy that the emission in the he  ii @xmath111 line is generally not much lower than that in the h@xmath112 line , which may be used as an indicator for massive pop  iii stars @xcite .    for a @xmath128 detection with an exposure time of @xmath64 hours",
    ", the spectrograph on miri exhibits a typical limiting sensitivity of @xmath129 @xcite , implying that the first h  ii regions are typically five orders of magnitude too faint for a direct detection .",

    "@xmath131 might contribute at a detectable level @xcite .",

    "for this reason we do not believe that the free - free signal of the first h  ii regions in their active or relic states will be observable in the near future.,width=321 ]      perhaps the most promising observational signature comes from 21-cm emission of the relic h  ii region gas once the star has died , a prospect that was already investigated by @xcite .",
    "an emission signal requires the spin temperature @xmath172 of neutral hydrogen to be greater than the temperature of the cmb , with its relative brightness determined by @xmath172 and the size of the relic h  ii region .",
    "the spin temperature is set by collisional coupling with neutral hydrogen atoms , protons and electrons , as well as radiative coupling to the cmb .",
    "furthermore , it may be modified by the so - called wouthuysen - field effect , which describes the mixing of spin states due to the absorption and re - emission of ly@xmath112 photons @xcite .",
    "the color temperature of the ly@xmath112 background is determined by the ratio of excitations to de - excitations , which approaches the kinetic gas temperature at high redshifts , where the optical depth to ly@xmath112 scattering is very large @xcite . in this case , adopting the rayleigh - jeans approximation and assuming @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the temperature associated with the 21-cm transition , the spin temperature may be written as @xcite @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the temperature of the cmb .",
    "the collisional coupling coefficient @xmath177 is approximately given by @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the einstein a - coefficient for the 21-cm transition , and @xmath180 and @xmath181 are the effective single - atom rate coefficients for collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms and electrons , respectively .",
    "good functional fits in the temperature range @xmath182 are given by @xmath183 and @xmath184 which we have obtained from the rates quoted in @xcite . at @xmath185 ,",
    "the electron fraction in the igm remains above @xmath186 for most of the lifetime of the relic h  ii region . in this case , the collisional coupling coefficient is given by @xmath187 a derivation of the ly@xmath112 coupling coefficient @xmath188 requires radiative transfer of local as well as global ly@xmath112 radiation , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we therefore consider two limiting cases : one in which we only consider collisional coupling , and the other in which a strong ly@xmath112 background drives the spin temperature towards the gas temperature ( i.e. @xmath189 or @xmath190 ) .",
    "the differential brightness temperature with respect to the cmb may then be derived as follows . in the rayleigh - jeans limit and for @xmath173 , the monochromatic radiative transfer equation for a ray passing through a cloud , evaluated in its comoving frame ,",
    "may be written in terms of the brightness temperature @xmath191 : @xmath192 where the optical depth at the 21-cm line is given by @xmath193 here , @xmath194 is the normalized line profile at the resonance frequency @xmath195 and @xmath196 is the distance traveled by the ray . in our case ,",
    "the line profile is dominated by thermal broadening , with a doppler width given by @xmath197 the amplitude of the line profile at the resonance frequency may be replaced by the doppler width , i.e. @xmath198 . with this definition , equation  ( 35 ) yields the differential brightness temperature @xmath199 , which becomes particularly simple for a constant spin temperature and the fact that the relic h  ii regions considered here are optically thin : @xmath200 the observed differential brightness temperature is then simply given by @xmath201 .    in fig .",
    "6 , we show the observed differential brightness temperature for a @xmath105 star and the two limiting cases discussed above .",
    "note that we have only taken into account ionized gas along the line of sight . for collisional coupling , the observed differential brightness temperature is of order a few @xmath202 for @xmath203 , while for perfect coupling the signal",
    "is elevated by an order of magnitude to a few @xmath204 for well over @xmath203 . in reality",
    ", the expected signal lies between these extremes and is a function of redshift , since collisional coupling becomes weaker as the background density drops , while ly@xmath112 coupling becomes stronger as the ly@xmath112 background rises . at @xmath185 , where the observationally accessible signal is produced",
    ", the ly@xmath112 background is likely strong enough for the latter to be more important @xcite .",
    "next , we determine the radio background produced by the integrated 21-cm emission of relic h  ii regions .",
    "the differential specific flux observed at the redshifted 21-cm line from a single relic h  ii region with differential brightness temperature @xmath205 is given by @xmath206 where @xmath207 denotes the solid angle subtended by the relic h  ii region , @xmath208 its area , @xmath209 its radius , and @xmath210 the angular diameter distance .",
    "the average differential specific flux @xmath211 within a beam size @xmath212 and bandwidth @xmath213 is then given by @xmath214 where @xmath215 , @xmath216 is the press - schechter mass function defined in equation  ( 24 ) , @xmath217 , and @xmath218 is the comoving volume per unit redshift and solid angle : @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the hubble expansion rate . with the definition of the brightness temperature , the average differential antenna temperature @xmath221",
    "is given by @xmath222 based on our argument above , we assume that the ly@xmath112 background is strong enough for perfect coupling at all redshifts . in this case , and for @xmath223 , the average differential antenna temperature becomes independent of electron fraction and temperature : @xmath224 where we have set @xmath225 in equation  ( 36 ) .",
    "we note that the observed frequency is related to the redshift via @xmath226 .",
    "we have further assumed that the relic h  ii region produced by each star - forming minihalo persists until the universe is reionized ( i.e. @xmath227 ) , which is a good approximation for perfect coupling and @xmath223 .",
    "equation  ( 43 ) thus provides a robust upper limit for the collective 21-cm emission from the first relic h  ii regions .    in fig .",
    "7 , we compare the average differential antenna temperature and specific flux for a beam size of @xmath228 to the sensitivity of the ska , assuming a @xmath128 detection , a bandwidth of @xmath169 , and an integration time of @xmath170 . at all frequencies",
    ", the maximum 21-cm signal from the first relic h  ii regions is of order @xmath202 , which is well detectable by the ska .",
    "the effects of biasing and radiative feedback will reduce this signal , but probably not enough to fall below the sensitivity of the ska . compared to free - free emission ,",
    "the 21-cm signal is typically an order of magnitude stronger , and offers the best prospect for indirectly probing the first stars .",
    "furthermore , the 21-cm signal is explicitly frequency - dependent , while this is not the case for bremsstrahlung , where a flat spectrum is produced ( see equation  28 ) .",
    "this dependency might allow for a better distinction from other sources of radio emission at these wavelengths .     to achieve the highest possible resolution and sensitivity at @xmath164 for the currently planned configuration of the ska .",
    "the dot - dashed , dotted and solid lines correspond to an initial mass function consisting solely of @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 pop  iii stars , respectively .",
    "the dashed line shows the sensitivity of the ska for a @xmath128 detection , a bandwidth of @xmath171 , and an integration time of @xmath170 . in all cases ,",
    "the 21-cm signal is well above the detection threshold of the ska .",
    "the effects of biasing and radiative feedback will reduce this signal , but probably not enough to fall below the sensitivity of the ska . compared to free - free emission",
    ", the 21-cm signal is typically an order of magnitude stronger , and offers the best prospect for indirectly probing the first stars.,width=321 ]",
    "we have introduced a general - purpose radiative transfer scheme for cosmological sph simulations that treats ionizing and photodissociating radiation from massive pop  iii stars in the early universe . based on this methodology",
    ", we have investigated the build - up of the first h  ii regions and relic h  ii regions around pop  iii stars formed in minihaloes , and predicted their contribution to the extragalactic radio background via bremsstrahlung and 21-cm emission .",
    "although recombination radiation from individual h  ii regions in their active as well as relic states is too faint to be directly detectable even with _ jwst _ , their collective radio emission might be strong enough to be within reach of the planned ska .",
    "in particular , we have found that the integrated free - free emission results in a maximum differential antenna temperature of @xmath229 , while the 21-cm emission is an order of magnitude stronger .",
    "considering the effects of biasing and negative radiative feedback , which would act to reduce the predicted signal , the free - free signal is likely beyond the capability of the ska , while the 21-cm signal will most likely be observable , providing an excellent opportunity for indirectly probing the first stars .",
    "we note that an analysis of the angular fluctuation power spectrum will be essential to isolate the 21-cm signal from other backgrounds @xcite , although the frequency - dependence of the 21-cm signal might already prove useful . among these are neutral minihaloes , which appear in emission due to their enhanced density and temperature @xcite , or igm gas heated by x - rays from supernovae @xcite , x - ray binaries @xcite , or the first quasars @xcite .",
    "a strong absorption signal might originate from cold , neutral gas if the ly@xmath112 background effectively couples the spin temperature to the gas temperature @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is the signal produced by stars ( primordial or already metal - enriched ) formed in the first dwarf galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "all of these compete with each other , and more work is required to understand their relative importance .",
    "one important task is to extend the simulations to larger cosmological volumes , to measure the aggregate signal from many sources in a more robust way .",
    "minihaloes may not have been the dominant formation sites for primordial stars , in terms of producing the bulk of the radiation that drove reionization , or of being the source for the majority of the heavy elements present at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , they are the ideal laboratory to test our current standard model of the first stars , by providing an exceedingly simple environment for the star formation process @xcite .",
    "the next step in the hierachical build - up of structure is already highly complex , due to the presence of metals , turbulent velocity fields , and possibly dynamically significant magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "it is therefore crucial to empirically probe the minihalo environment , and the signature left in the radio background might provide us with one of the few avenues to accomplish this in the foreseeable future .",
