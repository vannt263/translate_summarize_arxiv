    "analyses of emission - line profiles of ejecta - tracing elements in stripped - envelope , core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) during the `` nebular phase '' several months after outburst probe the chemical and kinematic properties of the metal - rich ejecta , thereby yielding clues about ccsn explosion dynamics and geometry .",

    "stripped - envelope sne lacking strong h@xmath3 emission ( i.e. , types iib , ib , and ic ) can be particularly informative because details of the interior regions are not obscured by the hydrogen envelope surrounding progenitors of type ii sne .",
    "late - time spectra of stripped ccsne have shown double - peaked line profiles in [ ] 6300 , 6364 emission to be a relatively common phenomenon , suggesting a possible unifying characteristic across types iib , ib , and ic .",
    "@xcite found double - peaked [ ] 6300 , 6364 profiles in 40% of a sample of 18 stripped ccsne , while @xcite reported finding double - peaked [ ] profiles in three of eight objects studied .",
    "such spectra show two conspicuous emission peaks , often symmetrically situated around a trough centered near 6300   and , when present , persist over the full observing period .",
    "double - peaked emission - line profiles deviate from the single - peaked profile expected from a spherically symmetric source and this has been interpreted in many cases as evidence for aspherically distributed debris having a torus or disk - like geometry .",
    "@xcite first predicted that double - peaked [ ] line profiles could be associated with a torus of o - rich ejecta .",
    "@xcite observed a double - peaked [ ] profile in the type ic broad - lined sn  2003jd , and interpreted it as emission originating from a torus of o - rich debris perpendicular to a high - velocity jet in a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) model .",
    "@xcite reported observing double - peaked profiles in the optical spectra of approximately 7 out of 18 ccsne and was able to model the profiles using an aspherical , torus - like geometry of o - rich ejecta .",
    "they concluded that the observed [ ] emission could be either single- or double - peaked depending on the viewing angle being either perpendicular to or along the torus plane .",
    "@xcite also interpreted double - peaked [ ] profiles in several ccsn spectra and found them consistent with a torus - like distribution of sn debris generated by the explosion physics , but not necessarily a grb - like jet / torus structure .",

    "we then compare the [ ] emission - line profiles of these and 13 other published late - time spectra in sections @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in section @xmath9 we summarize our findings , concluding in part that double - peaked [ ] line profiles are not necessarily the signature of emission from front and rear faces of o - rich ejecta arranged in a toroidal geometry as previously suggested .",

    "however , because of the correspondence between the blueshifted peaks in the ] 4571 , [ ] @xmath15577 , and [ ] 6300 , 6364 lines , [ ] @xmath15577 appears to be the dominant emission contributor .      to broaden our investigation of [ ] 6300 , 6364 line profiles , we examined a larger set of stripped - envelope ccsn spectra but this time not restricted to the availability of high quality late - time [ ] @xmath15577 , @xmath17774 or ] @xmath14571 line profile data . in figure 6 , we show a comparison of [ ] 6300 , 6364 emission - line profiles for a sample of 18 sne comprised of our five sne plus an additional 13 taken from the literature .",
    "table 2 references the sources , observing details , and estimated epochs of all spectra .",
    "these 18 objects have been divided into two main types : nine profiles that exhibit two prominent [ ] emission peaks positioned approximately symmetrically about 6300   ( _ left panel _ ) , and nine asymmetric profiles with one peak lying near 6300   and additional peaks at blueshifted velocities ( _ right panel _ ) .      the nine [ ] 6300 , 6364 emission - line profiles shown in the left panel of figure 6 share the property of exhibiting two conspicuous emission peaks positioned roughly on either side of 6300  .",
    "the velocity of the blueshifted emission peak ranges from @xmath54 to @xmath55  assuming it to be due to the [ ] @xmath16300 line .",
    "while the peaks can be narrow as in the case of 08ax or broad as in 03jd , the presence of these two emissions peaks dominates the overall appearance of the [ ] line profiles .",
    "we subdivided these nine objects into three subgroups .",
    "sometimes a third , weaker emission peak near zero velocity is seen in the [ ] 6300 , 6364 profile and this is highlighted in the figure for three sne 05kl , 04ao , and 07rz ( _ left panel , upper middle _ ) .",
    "contaminating [ ] emission from an underlying region is a possible but unlikely origin for this feature ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the broad - lined type ic sn , 03jd , plotted at the top of the figure in its own subgroup , also shows a weak emission peak near zero velocity .",
    "such profiles contrast with five sne ( 08ax , 06 t , 04fe , 05aj , and 04gt ) which exhibit a deep central trough between peaks with no obvious central emission peak ( _ left panel , bottom _ ) .",
    "although the relative strengths of the blueshifted and redshifted peaks vary across these subgroups , in most cases the spacing between the two peaks is close to 3000 km s@xmath11 ( i.e. , @xmath064  ) .",
    "the two lines of the [ ] 6300 , 6364 doublet ( more precisely at 6300.30 and 6363.78  ) are suspiciously close to this separation .",
    "we measured the center of the emission peaks for the profiles and found separations between @xmath56   in eight of nine symmetric profiles .",
    "the high incidence of a separation around 64    between emission peaks is illustrated in figure 7 , which is a montage of the eight symmetric peak profiles sharing this @xmath064    separation .",
    "the exception to this group and not shown in the figure is 03jd , which shows a separation close to twice this value .",
    "sn 2004gt also appears as an exception in the relatively noisy spectrum presented here , but the much cleaner day 160 spectrum presented in @xcite confirms a 64   separation .",
    "cccc   &   &   &   +   +   &   &   &     if the two peaks are associated with the two doublet lines of [ ] 6300 , 6364 , the observed 6300:6364 flux ratio of the lines is closer to 1:1 and not 3:1 as expected from the ratio of their transition probabilities when the lines are optically thin .",
    "this is perhaps unexpected , but not without precedent , as some sne have shown similar ratios smaller than the nebular 3:1 value .",
    "optical spectra of sn  1987a @xcite and 1988a @xcite showed [ ] 6300:6364 line ratios close to 1 in spectra taken at epochs @xmath57  d post - outburst .",
    "though likely originating from different physical conditions , [ ] 6300:6364 flux ratios around 2 and smaller are also routinely observed in novae at similar times @xcite .",
    "deviations from the 3:1 nebular value are attributed to optically thick line emission with @xmath58 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we investigate other possible interpretations of these non - nebular ratios in section @xmath8 .      the nine [ ] 6300 , 6364 emission - line profiles shown in the right panel of figure 6 exhibit two or more emission peaks , where one peak is located close to 6300  , and the other(s ) blueshifted with respect to 6300   producing an asymmetrical - looking line profile . as was done for the symmetric profile sn , we subdivided these asymmetric profiles into three groups .",
    "sn 2004dk , showing a relatively broad [ ] profile , forms the top grouping , while sn showing emission - line profiles that are multi - peaked or double - peaked form the middle and bottom groupings , respectively .",
    "much like that found for many of the symmetric [ ] profiles shown in the left panel , a few asymmetric profiles ( 90b , 07uy , and 08bo ; _ middle grouping _ ) exhibit emission peaks separated by @xmath59 3000 , i.e. , close to the 64    separation of the [ ] 6300 , 6364 doublet .",
    "however , most show separations between peaks larger or smaller than this ( _ top and bottom groupings _ ) with velocities of the blueshifted emission peak ranging from @xmath60 ( sn 1996cb ) to @xmath61 ( sn 2004dk ) . also unlike the symmetric profiles plotted in the left panel , most asymmetric profiles show no conspicuous redshifted emission peaks .",
    "the one apparent exception is 1990b , although the red emission feature observed around @xmath62  is likely the @xmath16364 line of [ ] ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an important caveat to figures 6 and 7 is that the [ ] 6300 , 6364 profiles are snapshots of emission profiles at single epochs and thereby do not address possible evolutionary changes . from the handful of examples having multi - epoch observations , symmetric profiles show blueshifted emission peaks that slowly weaken in strength relative to their redshifted companions .",
    "for example , sn 2008ax , ( figure 2 ) , sn 2004ao @xcite , and sn 2006 t ( compare day 106 of @xcite with day 371 of @xcite ) all exhibit slow but measurable evolution in their double - peaked [ ] 6300 , 6364 line profiles .",
    "notably , the emission peaks maintain their blueshifted / redshifted velocities in all cases .",
    "+       asymmetric profiles , on the other hand , show a variety of evolutionary timescales in their emission peaks . as demonstrated by the persistent blueshifted peaks of sn  2004dk and sn  2005bf in figure 6 , and recent observations of sn  2008d observed on day 363 that show little change from day 91 @xcite , some asymmetric profiles exhibit blueshifted peaks lasting hundreds of days . however , emission profiles like those seen in sn  2007uy and sn  2008bo are examples of asymmetric [ ] 6300 , 6364 line profiles exhibiting blueshifted emission peaks at early epochs ( @xmath63 d ) that diminish in strength at later times .",
    "although features observed at epochs @xmath51 d may be due to contributions from other emission - lines , the fact that these blueshifted features are routinely accompanied by blueshifted peaks in other oxygen and magnesium lines at matching velocities ( figure 5 ) makes contamination an unlikely source . as observed in symmetric profiles , the wavelength of blueshifted emission peaks in all asymmetric profiles does not change with time , and their strength relative to emission near zero velocity tends to weaken .",
    "several authors have proposed that double - peaked [ ] 6300 , 6364 emission - line profiles are consistent with emission originating from a torus or disk of o - rich material , possibly orientated perpendicular to a rapidly expanding jet @xcite . in this model ,",
    "an object s double - peaked [ ] profile reflects the observer s fortunate orientation close to the plane of an expanding torus / disk of o - rich ejecta leading to blueshifted and redshifted emission peaks associated with the approaching and receding portions .",
    "alternatively , viewing the torus perpendicular to the plane of expansion would result in a sharp , single - peaked [ ] line profile .    some of the observational trends noted above in section @xmath7 , however , signal warnings about adopting a torus / disk interpretation for some double - peaked [ ] 6300 , 6364 profiles .",
    "most apparent is that the separation of the two prominent peaks in symmetric [ ] profiles is often very close to 64  , i.e. , the separation of the [ ] 6300 , 6364 doublet ( figure 7 ) . instead of the blueshifted and redshifted peaks representing the forward and rear portions of an expanding torus of o - rich material",
    ", the separation suggests that the two peaks actually originate from the two lines of the doublet from a single emitting source on the front of the sn moving toward the observer .",
    "double emission peaks seen in asymmetric profiles with separations larger or smaller than the doublet spacing ( e.g. , sn 2004dk and 2005bf ) do not share this problem",
    ". however , the preferentially blueshifted emission profiles of figure 6 illustrate the point that asymmetric profiles rarely show prominent peaks at wavelengths significantly longward of 6300  .",
    "if the two observed emission peaks are attributed solely to the 6300   line of [ ] originating from a toroidal geometry of ejecta , then one must interpret the tori to have centers of expansion having velocities blueshifted toward the observer , with the most redshifted portion of the expanding ring / torus at a velocity close to zero .",
    "an example of a double - peaked [ ] 6300 , 6364 profile interpreted this way was sn 2005bf ( refer to figure 6 ) .",
    "@xcite modeled the blueshifted profile as emission originating from a layered blob of fe , ca , o material either ( 1 ) unipolar and moving at a center - of - mass velocity @xmath64 , or ( 2 ) suffering from self - absorption within the ejecta . in this case , the blueshifted double - peaked [ ] 6300 , 6364 line profile was thought to be unique , and thus explanation ( 1 ) involving an extremely elongated shell of o - rich material , though unusual , was not viewed as improbable especially in light of good model agreement .",
    "however , figure 6 suggests that asymmetric profiles like sn 2005bf are not unique . while blobs of ejecta moving at thousands of",
    "may represent one possible scenario ( e.g. , unipolar explosion models ; see @xcite ) , the frequent need for the centers of expansion of these blobs to be at velocities systematically directed toward the observer seems problematic .",
    "complications with a torus / disk model raised by our observations prompted us to investigate two alternative interpretations of the double - peaked [ ] 6300 , 6364 emission - line profiles .",
    "in light of mounting evidence that ccsne are intrinsically aspherical , a torus geometry might still be correct but with considerable internal extinction . in cases like sn  2003jd where the expansion velocity is especially high and",
    "extinction is minimal , one may be truly seeing both blue and red sides of a shell or torus @xcite .",
    "however , in other cases where velocities are smaller and extinction is higher , the rear side of the ejecta and its emission might be hidden , even at epochs @xmath65 d.    on the other hand , different line profiles observed in the oxygen and magnesium lines noted in section @xmath7 may originate from different regions of the sn .",
    "line formation differences attributable to density , temperature , and energy potential dependencies may be introducing pronounced emission discrepancies between elements and species .",
    "hence , the blueshifted , narrow profiles observed in [ ] @xmath15577 and the zero velocity , broad profiles observed in @xmath17774 may originate from two different regions of the sn : ( 1 ) a central , pseudo - spherically symmetric distribution of o - rich ejecta , and ( 2 ) a clump or shell of o - rich material traveling at a moderate velocity ( @xmath66 to @xmath67 ) in the front - facing hemisphere .",
    "we explored both of these scenarios in simple line fitting models .",
    "below , we briefly discuss the results of these models , comment on their interpretations , and highlight their own associated difficulties .",
    "+         +        the [ ] 6300 , 6364 emission - line profile that would follow from a single preferentially blueshifted emission source was investigated first .",
    "this configuration mimics emission originating from a blueshifted , optically thick , and high density region ( possibly the front side of a ring , torus , or hollow shell with densities upward of @xmath68 @xmath69 ) where the 6300:6364 flux ratio could approach unity and the lack of a corresponding redshifted emission peak might be due to significant internal extinction in the ejecta .",
    "both observed [ ] @xmath15577 and ] @xmath14571 emission - line profiles were used as templates for the [ ] 6300 , 6364 lines .",
    "the [ ] @xmath15577 profiles were used for earlier epochs ( @xmath70 d ) and the ] @xmath14571 at later ones ( @xmath71 d ) , as these epochs represent when the lines are best observed .",
    "the template profiles were separated by 3000  in velocity , added , and the result scaled to match the amplitude of the observed [ ] 6300 , 6364 profile of the same epoch .",
    "the sne having the best time coverage of our data set ( sn  2008ax and sn  2004ao ) were modeled at two epochs , while two other objects displaying these lines with adequate s / n were modeled at one epoch ( sn 2004dk and sn 2006 t ) .",
    "figure 8 shows a comparison between the line fitting models and observed [ ] 6300 , 6364 profiles .",
    "the top panels show our results with the [ ] @xmath15577 template .",
    "the best fits were obtained using a 6300:6364 flux ratio of 1:1 in all three cases .",
    "noticeable disagreement on the red side might be due to less reddening / extinction around 6300   as compared to around 5577  , and/or contribution from other lines to the red of the oxygen emission as evidenced by the moderate strength emission at higher redward velocities .",
    "the agreement is good for sn 2008ax and 2004ao , but rather poor in sn 2006 t where peak height is adequately matched but position and width is not .",
    "the bottom panels of figure 8 present [ ] line models using the ] @xmath14571 line template . both sn 2004ao and 2004dk show good agreement and were best fit with templates added in a 3:1 ratio . however , sn 2008ax was best fit with a ratio of 1.2:1.0 and showed an overall reasonable fit but with noticeable disparity between the line model and observation around zero velocity .",
    "the results with our single component line fitting models corroborate observations made in the @xcite survey of [ ] 6300 , 6364 profiles of ib / c sn .",
    "taubenberger et al .",
    "also used emission - line profiles of ] @xmath14571 to model [ ] 6300 , 6364 profiles as we have done here , and found general agreement between the two profiles at sufficiently late phases .",
    "furthermore , among the double - peaked profiles they modeled , taubenberger et al .  reported that two sne , sn 2000ew and 2004gt , could be fit very well with gaussian distributions of the deblended 6300 , 6364 lines originating from a single narrow , blueshifted component .",
    "although the one - component line fitting models are encouraging in five out of six profiles presented here , attributing double - peaked [ ] emission to the two doublet lines has problems .",
    "the most serious problem is the origin of the preferentially blueshifted emission .",
    "expansion of sn ejecta should lower density significantly such that emitted optical photons have minimal interaction with the gas at nebular epochs @xcite , but the @xmath591:1 flux ratio of the sn 2004ao and 2008ax [ ] 6300 , 6364 line models and the lack of redshifted emission imply a significantly high optical depth even at epochs of day @xmath59100 and greater .",
    "another potential problem for the single component model is the evolution of the blue / red peak height ratio . as seen in figure 2 , the blueshifted peak decreases in strength relative to the redshifted peak with time .",
    "the opposite evolution is expected , however , if the two peaks are associated with the [ ] 6300 , 6364 doublet lines , since expansion of the sn should drive the blue / red peak height ratio towards the nebular 3:1 ratio . a similar blue / red peak evolution away from the nebular 3:1 ratio in the [ ] 6300 , 6364 profile of sn 2004ao led @xcite to conclude that the doublet lines were likely not behind the observed emission peaks .",
    "however , the evolution of the [ ] 5577 line profile in sn  2008ax offers a possible explanation of the ratio change observed between emission peaks .",
    "our multi - epoch observations show a gradual fading in the blue wing of the [ ] @xmath15577 profile ( figure 2 , _ left _ ) , and our modeled [ ] profile shows that the bluest peak ( representing the 6300 component ) sits on top of the blue wing of the 6364   component .",
    "thus , if the strength of the blue wing decays , the strength of the blue 6300  component will drop relative to the red 6364    one .",
    "unfortunately , attempts at modeling this evolution at epochs beyond 74  d were inconclusive because of the relatively poor s / n in the [ ] @xmath15577 line at later epochs .",
    "we next investigated the [ ] 6300 , 6364 line profile that would follow from the contribution of two emission components .",
    "line fitting models of [ ] 6300 , 6364 emissions were constructed using the iraf package specfit @xcite .",
    "each profile fit consisted of five sources : ( 1 ) a linear continuum , ( 2 ) a _ broad _ ( fwhm @xmath72  ) gaussian centered at @xmath73  , ( 3 ) another gaussian shifted 64   to the red fixed with the same fwhm but one third its strength , ( 4 ) a _ narrow _ ( fwhm @xmath74  ) gaussian at a blueshifted wavelength , and ( 5 ) another narrow gaussian 64   to the red fixed with the same fwhm and one third its strength .",
    "the free parameters were the strength of the linear continuum , and the position , fwhms , and relative strengths of the pairs of peaks .",
    "the line profile model was tested with four sne ( sn  2007gr , sn  2008ax , sn  2008bo , and sn  2004ao from @xcite ) showing symmetric and asymmetric profiles .    in figure 9",
    "we present the results of these reconstructed emission - line profiles .",
    "the top panels show fits for symmetric profiles .",
    "the agreement between our model profiles and the observational data for sn 2008ax and sn 2004ao is good .",
    "sn 2006 t , on the other hand , shows considerable disagreement .",
    "the blue / red peak ratio is not matched , and there is considerable emission at wavelengths longward of 6300  .",
    "we attempted to correct for the discrepancy in the blue / red peak ratio using non - nebular 6300:6364 flux ratios ( see the inset of figure 9 ) .",
    "the model s agreement with the observed data for sn 2006 t improved as a result , although continued disagreement in the peak separation and individual width was evident .",
    "the bottom panels of figure 9 present our line fitting results for asymmetric profiles . in all cases the agreement is good , although agreement is relatively poor in sn  2007gr near the zero velocity peak .",
    "this discrepancy , as well discrepancies in other line models , may in part be a reflection of the inadequate use of gaussian distributions to model the emission .",
    "the fixed 3:1 ratio used for the two components would seem to run counter to the evolution of the blue / red peak height ratio observed in symmetric profiles .",
    "however , @xcite recently concluded that the line centroids of the bulk of [ ] emission at phases earlier than day @xmath75 were blueshifted @xmath5920  , after which they drift close to zero velocity .",
    "this phenomenon offers an explanation for the apparent 6300:6364 ratio decrease over observed epochs .",
    "assuming a broad / central + narrow / blueshifted interpretation , a gradual shift toward zero velocity of the broad component would cause the blueshifted @xmath16300 line of the narrow component to weaken in strength relative to the @xmath16364 companion line .",
    "we illustrate this possibility in figure 10 for sn 2004ao and sn 2008ax .",
    "while these profile fits are encouraging , two - component line fitting models have notable shortcomings .",
    "first , unlike the single - component scenario which used genuine emission profiles of the sne , these line models assume gaussian expansion profiles for both the broad and narrow components .",
    "this assumption along with the number of free variables used to replicate the observed profiles and the possible redundancy in the reconstructions introduces considerable uncertainty in the veracity of the model fits .    aside from these modeling concerns",
    ", there is also the question of why clumps are mainly visible on the forward facing hemisphere , and rarely from the rear side .",
    "if clumps were randomly distributed , a variety of blueshifted and redshifted emission peaks would be expected .",
    "any explanation in which a preferential visibility of blueshifted peaks might be caused by high internal extinction is complicated by the fact that considerable broad emission is seen at both higher blueshifted and redshifted velocities .",
    "double - peaked [ ] 6300 , 6364 emission - line profiles are not uncommon in the late - time spectra of stripped - envelope ccsne and have been interpreted as possibly originating from ejecta arranged in a torus or disk - like geometry . as part of an investigation into this phenomenon",
    ", we obtained optical spectra of five sne ( sn  2007gr , sn  2007rz , sn  2007uy , sn  2008ax , and sn  2008bo ) and examined the emission - line profiles of [ ] @xmath15577 , [ ] 6300 , 6364 , @xmath17774 , and ] @xmath14571 . because our spectra of sn  2008ax covered the broadest time interval ( day 67 to 418 ) and showed strong , sharp , and well defined [ ] emission peaks , we used sn  2008ax to help guide the investigation .",
    "we also examined the late - time [ ] 6300 , 6364 line profiles of 13 other stripped - envelope ccsne taken from the literature .         doubled - peaked line profiles are primarily in [ ] 6300 , 6364 emission ( figure 4 and 5 ) and can be categorized into two types .",
    "one type shows conspicuous _",
    "symmetric _ emission peaks positioned about 6300 that are persistent across the entire observing period .",
    "the other type shows _ asymmetric _ emission profiles with one emission peak near zero velocity ( i.e. , 6300  ) plus one or more peaks at blueshifted velocities that sometimes persist hundreds of days post outburst or evolve over short ( @xmath76 months ) timescales .",
    " emission peaks in symmetric double - peaked [ ] 6300 , 6364 line profiles are often close to @xmath62  apart ( i.e. , 64  ; figure 7 ) , nearly the 63.5    wavelength spacing of the [ ] doublet , suggesting the double - peaks are simply reflecting the doublet nature of the [ ] line emission . over time , the velocities of the two peaks do not change , but the blue / red peak intensity ratio slowly decreases .     conspicuous redshifted emission peaks are not observed in asymmetric profile cases . as seen for symmetric profiles , the position of blueshifted peaks does not change between observed epochs , but their strength relative to emission near zero velocity tends to weaken with time .",
    " when double - peaked [ ] profiles are present , single - peaked emission peaks at blueshifted velocities matching blueshifted peaks in [ ] 6300 , 6364 are often seen for [ ] @xmath15577 .",
    "the ] @xmath14571 and @xmath17774 lines generally show more blueshifted emission than redshifted emission and sometimes evidence of peaks at velocities matching blueshifted and/or zero - velocity peaks in the [ ] 6300 , 6364 lines .",
    "the high incidence of @xmath064   separation between emission peaks of symmetric profiles plus the lack of redshifted emission peaks in asymmetric profiles suggests that emission from the rear of the sn may be suppressed .",
    "this leads us to conclude that double - peaked [ ] 6300 , 6364 line profiles of some stripped - envelope , core - collapse sne are not necessarily signatures of emission from the front and rear faces of a torus or elongated shell of o - rich ejecta as has been proposed .",
    "alternative interpretations for the observed [ ] 6300 , 6364 profiles were investigated through line - fitting models .",
    "two models were explored : model 1 where the [ ] profile arises only from preferentially blueshifted emission , and model 2 where the [ ] profile consists of two separate emission components , a broad emission source centered around zero velocity and a narrow , blueshifted source .",
    "both line - fitting models reproduced observed [ ] 6300 , 6364 profiles in the majority of test cases .",
    "model 2 showed better overall agreement to the data for all six cases of symmetric and asymmetric profiles across all epochs investigated , but model 1 had fewer parameters and convincing results in a subset of the symmetric profiles .",
    "similar line - fitting results have been reported in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that a torus or elongated shell model is still viable despite the concerns raised above if the rear portion of an o - rich torus or shell is somehow hidden by scattering or dust .",
    "moreover , two of the 18 sne studied in this sample , sn 2003jd and 2006 t , exhibited both blueshifted and redshifted emission peaks with separations and widths that could not be modeled under the alternative interpretations offered here .",
    "hence , these objects represent notable exceptions to the concerns raised in this paper and remain strong candidates for a torus geometry of the ejecta as previously proposed .",
    "_ why do these emission - line profiles lack redshifted emission peaks ? _",
    "the predominance of blueshifted emission features in the profiles studied is unclear but internal scattering or dust obscuration of emission from far side ejecta are the most likely scenarios .",
    "@xcite , who also found predominantly blueshifted peaks in [ ] 6300 , 6364 emission - line profiles in a sample of 39 type ib / c sne , favored an opaque inner ejecta scenario , citing that other explanations such as ejecta geometry , dust formation , and contamination from other lines , could not account for all observed trends .",
    "_ what is the physical nature of these blueshifted features ? _ the variety and strength of the emission peaks are suggestive of asphericity in the ejecta . but whether these features can be conclusively associated with cones , jets , or tori of unipolar / bipolar explosions is uncertain and beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we note that the difference between symmetric and asymmetric profiles in our two - component line - fitting models is a consequence of the parameters adopted for the narrow , blueshifted component ( i.e. , fwhm , central velocity , strength relative to the broad component near zero velocity , and 6300:6364 flux ratio ) .",
    "sophisticated models incorporating radiative transfer effects could explore how these line - fitting parameters may be related to physical quantities such as mass , velocity , size , and density of the o - rich material , as well as changes with viewing angle .",
    "such models could also investigate specific extinction mechanisms of the suspected opaque inner region .",
    "much more robust tests of line - fitting models are possible with spectra of improved time coverage , spectral resolution , and s / n for those ccsne displaying double - peaked [ ] 6300 , 6364 profiles .",
    "moreover , observations optimized around the lines of ] @xmath14571 , [ ] @xmath15577 , and @xmath17774 at late epochs starting from 50 days past maximum light could greatly help test the trends observed in our sample and help eliminate one of the two line models ( single or two component ) discussed here .",
    "infrared observations might also place constraints on the cause of the suspected internal extinction .",
    "while an opaque inner region appears to best explain the lack of redshifted features , late - time infrared studies of other stripped - envelope ccsne could characterize the presence of internal molecules and dust as a test of one source of extinction at the epochs studied here .",

    "<S> we present optical spectra of sn  2007gr , sn  2007rz , sn  2007uy , sn  2008ax , and sn  2008bo obtained in the nebular phase when line profiles can lead to information about the velocity distribution of the exploded cores . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these to 13 other published spectra of stripped - envelope core - collapse supernovae ( type iib , ib , and ic ) to investigate properties of their double - peaked [ ] 6300 , 6364 emission . </S>",
    "<S> these 18 supernovae are divided into two empirical line profile types : ( 1 ) profiles showing two conspicuous emission peaks nearly symmetrically centered on either side of 6300   and spaced @xmath064    apart , close to the wavelength separation between the [ ] 6300 , 6364 doublet lines , and ( 2 ) profiles showing asymmetric [ ] line profiles consisting of a pronounced emission peak near 6300    plus one or more blueshifted emission peaks . </S>",
    "<S> examination of these emission profiles , as well as comparison with profiles in the lines of [ ] @xmath15577 , @xmath17774 , and ] @xmath14571 , leads us to conclude that neither type of [ ] double - peaked profile is necessarily the signature of emission from front and rear faces of ejecta arranged in a toroidal disk or elongated shell geometry as previously suggested . </S>",
    "<S> we propose possible alternative interpretations of double - peaked emission for each profile type , test their feasibility with simple line - fitting models , and discuss their strengths and weaknesses . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying cause of the observed predominance of blueshifted emission peaks is unclear , but may be due to internal scattering or dust obscuration of emission from far side ejecta . </S>"
