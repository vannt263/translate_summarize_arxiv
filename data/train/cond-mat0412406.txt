    "<S> we predict and analyse a novel spin filter in semiconducting carbon nanotubes . by using local electrostatic gates , </S>",
    "<S> the conduction and valence bands can be modulated to form a double - barrier structure . </S>",
    "<S> the confined region below the valence band defines a zener quantum dot , which exhibits resonant tunnelling . </S>",
    "<S> the resonances split in a magnetic field to make a bipolar spin filter for applications in spintronics and quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> we model this using @xmath0 envelope function theory and show that this is in excellent agreement with a corresponding tight - binding calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> a spin filter based on electrostatic gating of single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swcnts ) may have significant advantages over alternative approaches , based on spin injection from ferromagnetic contacts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental techniques are now well established for placing source drain contacts at each end of a carbon nanotube and using a side gate to control electron transport . </S>",
    "<S> such devices exhibit coulomb blockade in metallic @xcite and semiconducting @xcite swcnts , and field - effect transistor action @xcite at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> electrical conductance through near ideal ohmic contacts has been predicted @xcite and shown experimentally to exhibit ballistic conductance close to the clean quantum limit of @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> electron interference was first demonstrated in metallic swcnts @xcite and more recently within the conduction band of semiconducting swcnts @xcite , where the existence of schottky barriers posed additional difficulties with contact resistance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the kondo effect has been exhibited in metallic swcnts @xcite and optical emission from ambipolar fets has been demonstrated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these devices have used global gating along the entire length of the active part of the nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> local gating of carbon nanotubes has been demonstrated with split gates , finger gates and top gates fabricated by lithographic means @xcite . through local gating </S>",
    "<S> , the nanotube can be made to function as a pn - junction diode without modulation doping by using two closely spaced finger gates , which are positively and negatively charged with respect to source - drain contacts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> top gates have been used to form and control a double quantum dot @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that local gating also opens up the possibility of spin filtering via zener tunnelling . </S>",
    "<S> although zener tunnelling has yet to be demonstrated in semiconducting swcnts , our calculations show that there is no fundamental obstacle to its observation . </S>",
    "<S> the main challenge is to achieve sufficiently localised electric fields along the nanotubes , through which an electron can tunnel elastically between valence and conduction bands . </S>",
    "<S> if a locally - gated semiconducting swcnt is gated negatively with respect to adjacent electrodes , the electrostatic field bends the energy bands upwards in the region of the gate , leading to a double zener tunnelling structure and the formation of quasi - bound states , as illustrated in .        in equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> these are occupied by holes above the fermi level at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> if an electron in the conduction band has energy corresponding to one of the quasi - bound states , resonant tunnelling will occur . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting structure is essentially a quantum dot ( qd ) , since there is confinement in all three spatial dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasise that our zener qd , inspired by previous work on a single - electron transistor @xcite , is an original idea which may have several applications in addition to our suggested spin filter . unlike a conventional dot , </S>",
    "<S> both the conduction and valence bands form the two confinement barriers using a single gate electrode . </S>",
    "<S> these barriers provide an opportunity to aviod any material interfaces which generally inhibit electron coherence effects . </S>",
    "<S> the gate electrode can be realised by using a local split gate @xcite . for practical implementation </S>",
    "<S> we consider three split gates , as shown in , in which the outer two are initially held at the same potential as the global back gate .        </S>",
    "<S> their purpose is to confine the electrostatic potential , enabling higher electric fields along the nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> split gates of this kind have already been fabricated for multiwalled nanotubes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these gates can be produced down to a width and lateral separation of order @xmath2 nm , so that a few volts applied to the electrodes give local fields of up to @xmath3 mv @xmath4 to enable zener tunnelling .    in a perfect sheet of graphene </S>",
    "<S> there are two inequivalent fermi points in the first bz with wavevectors @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> these fermi points are uncoupled in our system since the applied potential varies slowly on an atomic scale , and we can therefore apply @xmath0 envelope function theory to the two fermi points independently . to derive an effective hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> we first expand the single - particle @xmath6-orbital hamiltonian around an arbitrary fermi point of graphene @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion for wavevectors close to this fermi point is then given by the effective hamiltonian : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath9 is the electron quasimomentum operator along and around the nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudo - spin @xmath10 connects the a and b sublattices and accounts for both conduction and valence sub - bands with the real spin giving rise to further degeneracy which we do not consider explicitly yet . </S>",
    "<S> this hamiltonian is identical to weyl s hamiltonian with two spatial dimensions and solution of the corresponding schrdinger equation with plane waves yields directly the energy dispersion , @xmath11 which is the familiar light - cone in which the speed of light has been replaced by the fermi velocity of graphene , @xmath12 . in swcnts </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 is quantised . for metallic nanotubes @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> is allowed and equation yields the characteristic linear dispersion , @xmath15 of massless particles . in a semiconducting zigzag nanotube the lowest quantised @xmath13 is finite and may be positive or negative , where the sign reflects the choice of fermi point . from equation with @xmath16 , we see directly that @xmath17 , and hence the dispersion in the @xmath18-direction has the relativistic form of particles with rest mass ( effective mass ) @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we only consider the lowest quantised bands since we will later show that zener tunnelling through higher bands is negligible due to larger band separations . </S>",
    "<S> these energy dispersions and the effective hamiltonian incorporate the rapidly varying atomic potentials due to the carbon atoms . envelope function theory allows us to simply add to this the slowly varying applied potential , @xmath20 , to yield an effective hamiltonian for the whole system , which is valid for the conduction and valence bands close to the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath21 is independent of @xmath22 we may integrate out the @xmath22-motion for the lowest transverse channels , yielding the one - dimensional effective hamiltonians , @xmath23 where the positive and negative signs correspond to clockwise and anticlockwise motion around the tube respectively , and @xmath24 is the unit matrix . </S>",
    "<S> we need only solve the schrdinger equation for one of these cases since the degenerate sets of solutions are related by the transformation @xmath25 . by solving laplace s equation the potential @xmath20 for the gate configuration shown in can be represented by the convenient analytic form @xmath26 to a good approximation . for the simulations described below , we have used the potential parameters @xmath27 v and @xmath28 nm . </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed that there is no potential gradient transverse to the nanotube , which is a good approximation due to the symmetry of the split gates and the high ratio of gate width to tube diameter .    </S>",
    "<S> we have solved the one - electron scattering problem using a nearest - neighbour finite - difference method and then calculate the low - bias conductance from the tunnelling transmission probability using the landauer - bttiker formula , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of open channels and @xmath31 is the average transmission probability per channel . in ( a ) , we show results for the dimensionless conductance in the presence of the gate potential , obtained using the @xmath0 envelope function approach . </S>",
    "<S> this shows clear zener resonances as a function of the electron energy @xmath32 . as a check on the validity of this long - wavelength approximation , </S>",
    "<S> we have computed the conductance using a tight - binding model using a recursive green function approach @xcite including all @xmath6-orbital bands from the quantisation of the graphene lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting zener resonances from the two methods are compared in ( b ) where we have zoomed the energy to show the separation and shape of two resonances at low energy . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement is remarkable , with the very small deviations between the two methods arising from the difference in energy dispersion for high @xmath33-values on the dot . in these calculations , </S>",
    "<S> four open channels are present ( @xmath34 ) for the chosen energy range , but only the lowest conduction and highest valence bands contribute to the resonant transport ( @xmath35 ) , with almost total reflection from all other bands .     envelope function theory . </S>",
    "<S> the local gating has produced several sharp resonances . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) small bias conductance at low energy comparing resonances from @xmath0 envelope function theory calculations ( dashed line ) and tight - binding calculations ( solid line ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the tight - binding resonances confirm that only two channels contribute to the transmission . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we can gain insight into these results by an approximate breit - wigner analysis of resonances through the two zener barriers , which are described by the equation @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the resonance energy of the @xmath38-th quasi - bound state and @xmath39 is the corresponding half - width . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can be estimated using a triangular potential @xcite within the semiclassical wkb approximation @xcite . for a nanotube with band gap @xmath40 , </S>",
    "<S> the resonance width becomes @xmath41 where the tunnel barrier width is @xmath42 , with classical turning points @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the prefactor @xmath44 mostly depends on the resonance energy via the confinement length @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46 is the average group velocity along the nanotube direction . in , we have compared the resonance widths from equation with the numerical widths derived from the @xmath0 results [ _ cf _ ( a ) ] .     </S>",
    "<S> envelope function theory . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line is an estimate of the widths derived analytically using the wkb approximation . in this figure </S>",
    "<S> the widths are calculated for a ( 19,0)-nanotube . ]    in order to be resolved , the widths @xmath39 of the resonances must be larger than the thermal energy @xmath47 . for our chosen potential [ see equation ] , the temperature of @xmath48-nanotubes must not be higher than of order 2 - 3 kelvins at the conduction band edge . </S>",
    "<S> the precise requirement is sensitive to the potential shape at low energies . generally , larger - diameter nanotubes with smaller band gaps exhibit larger resonance widths in accordance with equation . </S>",
    "<S> the band gap dependence is in fact the reason why zener resonant tunnelling through higher subbands is strongly suppressed .    </S>",
    "<S> the location of the resonance energies @xmath37 , may also be estimated using the wkb approximation , through @xmath49 apart from the turning points , where the wavevector is small and the integral is negligible , the energy dispersion is mainly in the linear regime , @xmath50 . writing the total energy as a sum of kinetic and potential energy , @xmath51 , where the potential energy is the applied potential in equation , allows us to integrate equation ; </S>",
    "<S> @xmath52 if we taylor expand the applied potential , @xmath53 $ ] and then integrate equation , we can solve for the resonance energies ; @xmath54 as a consequence of the linear dispersion , the resonance energies are @xmath55 instead of the usual @xmath56 , for large @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon can be seen in ( a ) , where the resonances become more closely spaced towards the left of the diagrams , corresponding to increasing kinetic energies in the valence band .     </S>",
    "<S> mev . </S>",
    "<S> the left(right ) solid curve show the spin up(down ) resonance arising when a transverse magnetic field of @xmath57 t is applied . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we now demonstrate that the above zener tunnelling effect opens up the possibility of spin filtering for possible applications in quantum information processing , as has been suggested for unipolar quantum dots @xcite . in a uniform transverse magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> spin up / down electrons each experience their own set of resonances separated by @xmath58 mev for @xmath59 ( _ cf _ reference @xcite ) and @xmath60 t. in we have shown this for a resonance width of @xmath61 mev . for these parameters , </S>",
    "<S> the polarisation is @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> higher polarisations can be achieved by using narrower resonances .    </S>",
    "<S> this new spin filter has advantages over spin injection from ferromagnetic contacts , since spin - memory loss due to interface scattering at interfaces is avoided . </S>",
    "<S> local gating also allows complementary devices using electron- or hole - conduction , which may be advantageous if cn - based electronics is ever to form a basis for future nanoscale cmos technology .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we remark that coulomb repulsion between the holes on the zener qd will modify the resonant level structure . </S>",
    "<S> this shifts the energy levels and , in particular , introduces an energy difference between electrons of opposite spin in the same orbital state . in this sequential tunnelling regime </S>",
    "<S> the number of holes in the zener dot will fluctuate between even and odd giving rise to a single - electron current from source to drain . </S>",
    "<S> consider a number of holes @xmath38 of the dot . </S>",
    "<S> the hole levels will be occupied down to the resonant level . </S>",
    "<S> an electron can resonantly zener tunnel into the hole state ( equivalent to the hole tunnelling from the dot to the source lead ) leaving the dot with @xmath63 holes . </S>",
    "<S> a further electron can not tunnel into the dot since there will no longer be an available state to occupy . </S>",
    "<S> due to the resonant tunnelling the electron will then preferentially tunnel from the dot into the drain lead giving rise to a single - electron transfer from source to drain .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the zener resonances could be demonstrated experimentally using a back - gate to change the fermi energy which may be tuned to the resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the source - drain voltage should be sufficiently small in order that the electrons do not exceed the optic phonon threshold of approximately @xmath64 mev . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to semiconducting nanotubes , one may also attempt to use quasi - metallic nanotubes with much smaller bandgaps induced by curvature . these have even smaller tunnel barriers , and consequently larger resonances which may be easier to observe .    </S>",
