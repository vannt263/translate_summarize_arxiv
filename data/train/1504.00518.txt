    "our measurements are in agreement with a model we have presented .",
    "in future work one may employ state transformation via adiabatic passage as a method to generate highly dipolar matter , against obstacles that may otherwise arise from inhomogeneous broadening , excitation blockade effects , and small rates for direct optical excitation of highly dipolar states .",
