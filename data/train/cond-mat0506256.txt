    "a homogeneously initialized force free granular gas , i.e. , a rarefied systems of inelastically colliding macroscopic particles , stays homogeneous during the first stage of its evolution while its temperature , that is the average kinetic energy of particles , decays due to dissipative collisions .",
    "this state of a granular gas is called the _ homogeneous cooling state_. at later stages , granular gases develop density inhomogeneities @xcite and pronounced spatial correlations of the velocity field @xcite . throughout this article",
    "we consider granular gases in the homogeneous cooling state .",
    "similar as ordinary molecular gases , granular gases in the homogeneous cooling state are characterized by their temperature and their velocity distribution function , which is close to the maxwell distribution . like in molecular gases , impurities ( guest particles ) , that is particles which differ from the gas particles by mass , size or other parameters , move irregularly due to random collisions with the surrounding gas particles .",
    "this _ brownian motion _ of guest particles , i.e. diffusion , leads to uniform spreading of an initially localized ensemble of impurities over the available volume .",
    "if the guest particles are mechanically identical to the host particles , but may be somehow distinguished ( e.g. by color ) , the process is called self - diffusion and the guest particles are called tracers .    the processes of diffusion and self - diffusion in granular gases differ from those in molecular gases because of the dissipative nature of particle collisions .",
    "a collisions of dissipatively colliding particles is characterized by the coefficient of restitution @xmath0 .",
    "this coefficient relates the post - collision velocities @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the colliding particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 to their pre - collision velocities @xmath6 and @xmath7 . for particles of identical mass",
    "the collision law reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "the unit vector @xmath10 with @xmath11 describes the relative particle position at the instant of the collision . for particles of different mass",
    "the corresponding relation has a similar form @xcite .",
    "the collision law takes only the normal component of the particles relative velocity into account .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath0 , is also called the _",
    "normal _ coefficient of restitution  the tangential component of the relative velocity is not affected by a collision ( see @xcite , chap . 3.4 for a detailed discussion of this non - trivial approximation ) . in what follows we consider the normal coefficient of restitution .",
    "granular gases are never in thermodynamic equilibrium because of the permanent loss of energy due to dissipative particle collisions .",
    "therefore , the basic law of equilibrium statistical mechanics , the equipartition of kinetic energy , is not applicable for granular gases . consequently , the temperature of the gas particles may differ from the temperature of the guest particles @xcite .",
    "hence , in granular gases the temperature is species dependent .",
    "the violation of equipartition leads to many interesting phenomena , like criticality of the brownian motion @xcite and turns the analysis technically complicated . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of self - diffusion , when the gas may be characterized by a single temperature , that is , we discuss the diffusion of tracers . in spite of being much simpler , self - diffusion demonstrates the most salient properties of transport in granular gases .",
    "it allows to illustrate the application of the main theoretical approaches for the computation of the transport coefficients , the green - kubo and chapman - enskog approaches , without much technical complications .",
    "we show that for the case of a constant coefficient of restitution , the green - kubo approach , which has been initially elaborated for equilibrium systems , may be efficiently exploited . for a direct and thus simple application of this method",
    ", the dissipative gas dynamics can be mapped onto the corresponding dynamics of a system which remains in an effective steady - state .",
    "we will show that in this case the green - kubo and chapman - enskog methods yield the same result for the self - diffusion coefficient .",
    "for the case @xmath1const . such a simple map exists .",
    "the assumption of a constant coefficient of restitution simplifies the analysis drastically , however , it does not agree with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the assumption @xmath1const . contradicts the mechanics of materials @xcite and even violates a dimension analysis @xcite .",
    "instead , experiments as well as theory show that the coefficient of restitution increases with decreasing impact velocity .",
    "thus , for @xmath12 particles tend to collide elastically , that is @xmath13 if surface effects are neglected .",
    "this basic property motivates a drastically simplified collision model @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the normal component of the relative velocity @xmath16 at the impact .",
    "thus , it is assumed that impacts at large normal relative velocity occur with a constant coefficient of restitution @xmath17 , while collisions at small @xmath18 are elastic , i.e. , the threshold @xmath19 separates elastic from inelastic collisions .",
    "the model parameters , @xmath17 and @xmath19 , are neither related to the material properties of particles nor derived from first principles of the collision dynamics .",
    "the coefficient of restitution as a function of the impact velocity may be also derived analytically by integrating newton s equation of motion for a colliding pair , provided the particle interaction force is known .",
    "the simplest physically realistic mechanical model of dissipative collisions assumes that particles interact by viscoelastic forces @xcite .",
    "if inelasticity is small , the solution of the contact problem for viscoelastic spheres yields the coefficient of restitution @xcite @xmath20 where the coefficient @xmath21 is a known function of the elastic and dissipative constants , i.e. of the young modulus and the poisson ratio of the particles material , and of the masses and radii of the particles ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we will show that for the case of impact - velocity dependent @xmath0 there is no simple map of the dynamics of the dissipative system onto a corresponding dynamics of a steady - state system .",
    "this makes the application of the green - kubo method problematic . therefore , for the case of an impact - velocity",
    "dependent coefficient of restitution the chapman - enskog approach is used .",
    "we apply the latter method to calculate the self - diffusion coefficient for the case of a simplified impact - velocity dependent coefficient of restitution as well as for realistic gases of viscoelastic particles .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the microscopic interpretation of the macroscopic diffusion coefficient which suggests a route of its evaluation .",

    "vii and viii . in secs .",
    "v , vi and vii we explain the general concept of these methods for the simple case @xmath22 then we consider the more general case of impact - velocity dependent coefficient of restitution .",
    "we summarize our findings in sec .",

    "let tracers particles be embedded in the gas and let @xmath25 and @xmath26 be respectively the one - particle distribution function of the gas particles and of the tracers .",
    "then the local densities are defined by @xmath27 if the concentration of the tracers is not uniform , a diffusion flux of these particles arises , which is directed opposite to the concentration gradient : @xmath28 with the continuity equation @xmath29 we obtain the diffusion equation @xmath30 the diffusion coefficient @xmath31 in eq . , thus , relates the macroscopic flux of particles @xmath32 to the macroscopic concentration gradient @xmath33 .",
    "however , there is also a microscopic interpretation of the diffusion coefficient : it defines the time dependence of the mean square displacement of a tracer particle .",
    "assume at @xmath34 there is an ensemble of impurities located at the origin , @xmath35 .",
