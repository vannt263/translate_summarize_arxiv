    "in 1989 witten derived knot invariants such as the jones polynomial from quantum field theory based on the chern - simon lagrangian @xcite . inspired by witten s work in this paper we shall derive knot invariants from a gauge model of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and its nonabelian generalization . from our approach",

    "this kz equation is an equation of correlations from which in section [ sec9 ] we can derive the skein relation of the jones polynomial .",
    "a main point of our theory on the kz equation is that we can derive two kz equations which are dual to each other .",

    "let us extend the definition ( [ m6 ] ) to knot invariants for nontrivial knots .",

    "now for a closed curve we may cut it into a sum of parts which are formed by two pieces of curve crossing or not crossing each other .",
    "each of these parts is represented by ( [ m11 ] ) , ( [ m12 ] ) or ( [ m13 ] ) .",

    "the @xmath174 means multiplications of a sequence of parts represented by ( [ m11 ] ) , ( [ m12 ] ) or ( [ m13 ] ) according to the state of each part .",

    "we shall also derive the three reidemeister moves for the equivalence of knots .",
    "let us first consider a knot in fig .",

    "we see that ( [ m16 ] ) is just the knot invariant ( [ m6 ] ) of a trivial knot .",

    "when fig.2 is a part of a knot we can also derive a result similar to ( [ m18 ] ) which is for the reidemeister move 1 .",

    "this shows that the knot in fig.3b is with the same knot invariant of a trivial knot .",

    "more calculations and examples of the above knot invariants will be given elsewhere .",
    "with the knot invariants in the above section we can now give a classification of knots .",
    "let @xmath196 and @xmath197 be two knots . since the two w - products @xmath198 and @xmath199 faithfully represent two oriented pieces of curves which are crossing or not crossing to each other we have that from the orientation of a knot @xmath200 we have that the product of sequence of w - matrices ( we may call this product as a generalized wilson loop ) which are formed according to the orientation of @xmath200 in the correlation ( [ m14 ] ) of defining an invariant of the knot @xmath200 faithfully represents the knot @xmath200 . from this",

    "then since each knot can be changed to a trivial knot by applying braiding operation @xcite which is equivalent to ( [ m7a ] ) , ( [ m8a ] ) and ( [ m9 ] ) it follows that these new knot invariants can be equivalently transformed to the form @xmath201 where @xmath0 is an integer and @xmath202 is the knot invariant for the trivial knot .",
    "this form can also be shown by a direct computation which is similar to the computation of the invariant of the trivial knot .",

    "is equal to : @xmath211 then let us consider the following correlation : @xmath212 we let the ordering of the @xmath4-matrices in ( [ l5 ] ) be such that @xmath170 starts first and @xmath206 follows it . then next @xmath207 starts first and @xmath171 follows it . from the ordering we have that ( [ l5 ] ) is equal to : @xmath213 on the other hand from the ordering of ( [ l5 ] ) we have that ( [ l5 ] ) is equal to : @xmath214 where we have repeatly used ( [ m9 ] ) . from ( [ l4 ] ) , ( [ l6 ] ) and ( [ l7 ] ) we have that the knot invariant for the hopf link in fig.7a is given by : @xmath215    then let us consider the hopf link in fig.7b .",
    "the correlation for this link is given by @xmath216 by a derivation which is dual to the above derivation for the hopf link in fig.7a we have that ( [ l9 ] ) is equal to @xmath217 we see that the invariants for the above two hopf links are different .",
    "this agrees with the fact that these two links are not topologically equivalent .    we can extend the above computations to other links . as examples let us consider the linking of two trivial knot with linking number @xmath218 .",
    "similar to the above computations we have that this link which analogous to the hopf link in fig.7a is with an invariant equals to @xmath219 .",
    "also for this link which analogous to to the hopf link in fig.7b is with an invariant equals to @xmath220 .",
    "more calculations and examples of these new link invariants will be given elsewhere .",
    "in this section let us give some arguments to determine the new knot invariants of prime knots and nonprime knots .",
    "we have shown that this new invariant of each knot is of the form @xmath221 where @xmath0 is an integer .",
    "this power index @xmath0 can be regarded as a measure of the complexity of a knot .",
    "let us determine @xmath0 for prime and nonprime knots .",
    "we need only to determine @xmath0 for knots with positive @xmath0 since the corresponding mirror image will have negative @xmath0 if the mirror image is not equivalent to the corresponding knot .",
    "we have shown that the invariants for links of two trivial knots with linking number @xmath218 as in fig.7a are with the product of @xmath2 of the form @xmath222 with @xmath223 .",
    "this @xmath0 is an even number .",
    "now if we insert these links into the knot table of prime knots we see that the prime knots must with @xmath0 being an odd number ( we may refer to the knot table in @xcite .",
    "we may have nonprime knots which are not in this knot table having the same @xmath0 as these links . in this case",
    "our new link invariants still can distinguish them because the corresponding link invariants are of two - loop form while the corresponding knot invariants are of one - loop form ) .",
    "then we expect that for prime knots @xmath0 is an odd prime number .",
    "computations show that for the knot @xmath224 we have @xmath225 , for the knot @xmath226 we have @xmath227 .",
    "then from some arguments on the effect of @xmath2 we should have that for the knot @xmath228 we have @xmath229 and for the knot @xmath230 we have @xmath231 .",
    "then how about the knot @xmath232 ?",
    "we have that the numbers from @xmath233 to @xmath234 are ocupied by knots and links of two trivial knots",
    ". then @xmath235 is ocupied by the link of two trivial knots with linking number @xmath236 .",
    "thus for the knot @xmath232 we should have @xmath237 or @xmath238 . from some argument on the effect of @xmath2",
    "we should have @xmath238 for @xmath232 .",
    "then is there a knot with @xmath237 ?",
    "let us first consider the granny knot ( or the square knot ) which is a nonprime knot composed with the knot @xmath224 and its mirror image .",
    "this square knot has @xmath239 crossings and @xmath240 alternating crossings and thus its complexity which is measured by the power index @xmath0 of @xmath2 is less than that of @xmath228 which is with @xmath236 alternating crossings .",
    "thus this granny knot is with @xmath241 ( @xmath227 has been occupied by @xmath226 ) .",
    "let us denote this granny knot by @xmath242 where @xmath243 denotes the connected sum of two knots such that the resulting total number of alternating crossings is equal to the total number of alternating crossings of the two knots minus @xmath244 .",
    "then let us consider the reef knot which is a nonprime knot composed with two identical knots @xmath224 .",
    "this knot has @xmath239 alternating crossings which is equal to the total number of crossings as that of @xmath232 . since",
    "this knot is nonprime its complexity is less than that of @xmath232 where the complexity may be measured by the power index @xmath0 of @xmath2 .",
    "thus this reef knot is with power index @xmath0 less than @xmath245 . then if we also regard the total number of alternating crossings of a knot as a way to measure the complexity of a knot we have that the power index @xmath0 of this granny knot is greater than @xmath236 since @xmath228 is with @xmath236 alternating crossings and with @xmath229 .",
    "let us denote this reef knot by @xmath246 where @xmath247 denotes the connected sum for two knots such that the resulting total number of alternating crossings is equal to the total number of alternating crossings of the two knots .",
    "now let us look for knots with @xmath236 or @xmath239 alternating crossings .",
    "let us consider the nonprime knot @xmath248 composed with a knot @xmath224 and a knot @xmath226 with @xmath249 crossings and @xmath236 alternating crossings .",
    "in this case we have that the power index @xmath0 of @xmath248 should be greater than that of @xmath228 which is exactly with @xmath236 alternating crossings since @xmath248 in addtion has @xmath249 crossings .",
    "then the power index @xmath0 of @xmath248 should be less than that of @xmath230 which is also with @xmath236 alternating crossings but these crossings are arranged in a more complicated way which is an effect of @xmath250 such that @xmath230 is with @xmath231 . thus @xmath248 is with @xmath251 .",
    "then we consider the nonprime knot @xmath252 with @xmath253 crossings and @xmath236 alternating crossings .",
    "the power index of this knot should be less than that of @xmath254 since it is with @xmath239 alternating crossings .",
    "then the power index of @xmath254 should be greater than that of @xmath230 since it has in addition @xmath253 crossings which would be enough for a greater power index @xmath0 .",
    "then we have that @xmath252 is with @xmath255 since it has @xmath253 crossings and @xmath236 alternating crossings and thus is with the same complexity as @xmath230 .",
    "then since @xmath230 can not have @xmath255 we thus have that @xmath252 is with @xmath255 .",
    "then we consider the nonprime knot @xmath256 with @xmath234 crossings and @xmath239 alternating crossings .",
    "the power index @xmath0 of this knot should be greater than that of @xmath254 which has exactly @xmath239 alternating crossings .",
    "then the power index @xmath0 of this knot should be less than that of @xmath232 which also has @xmath239 alternating crossings but these crossings are arranged in a more complicated way with an effect of @xmath257 from that of @xmath258 . thus @xmath256 is with @xmath259 and finally we have that @xmath254 is with power index @xmath237 .",
    "thus for @xmath0 from @xmath233 to @xmath245 we have fill in a suitable knot with power index @xmath0 ( except the case @xmath260 which is filled in with the hopf link ) such that odd prime numbers are filled with prime knots . in a similar way we may determine the power index @xmath0 of other prime and nonprime knots .",
    "we list the results up to @xmath261 in a form of table .",
    "@xmath262    from this table we see that comparable nonprime knots ( in a sense from the table ) are grouped in each of the intervals between two prime numbers .",
    "it is interesting that in each interval nonprime numbers are one - to - one filled with the comparable nonprime knots while prime numbers are filled with prime knots .",
    "this grouping property of classification reflects that the new knot invariants ( and hence the power index @xmath0 ) give a classification of knots .",
    "let us find out some rules for the whole classification table .",
    "we have shown that even numbers can not be filled with prime knots .",
    "thus even numbers ( except @xmath244 ) can only be filled with nonprime knots . on the other hand",
    "each odd nonprime number is between two even numbers which are power indexes of nonprime knots .",
    "thus the knot corresponding to this odd number is in the same group of these two nonprime knots and is comparable with these two nonprime knots and thus must also be a nonprime knot . from this",
    "we have that nonprime numbers are power indexes of nonprime knot . similarly by this grouping property we have that odd prime numbers are power indexes of prime knots .    it is interesting to note that from the above knot table we see that in the @xmath243 product the knot @xmath263 plays the role of the number @xmath244 in the usual multiplication of numbers .",
    "thus the @xmath243 product ( or the connected sum ) is a kind of multiplication corresponding to the usual multiplication of numbers .",
    "however the general rule for this multiplication is rather complicated .",
    "this reflects the fact that the numbers @xmath0 are the power indexes of @xmath2 which are with simple rule for the addition ( and not for multipication ) . from this generalized multiplication ( which is the connected sum ) of knots which corresponds to the usual multiplication of the power indexes",
    "@xmath0 we also have that prime knots are with odd prime numbers as power indexes and nonprime knots are with nonprime numbers as power indexes .",
    "thus we have a classification table of knots such that each prime knot corresponds to a prime power index @xmath0 and each nonprime knot corresponds to a nonprime power index @xmath0 . more computations to verify this knot table",
    "shall be given alsewhere .",
    "in this paper from a new quantum field model we have derived a conformal field theory and a quantum group structure for generalized wilson loops from which we can derive the jones polynomial and new knot and link invariants which extend the jones polynomial .",
    "we show that these new invariants can completely classify knots and links .",
    "these new invariants are in terms of the monodromy @xmath2 of two knizhnik - zamolochikov equations which are dual to each other . in the case of knots these new invariants can be written in the form @xmath203 from which we may classify knots with the power index @xmath0 of @xmath2 . a classification table of knots",
    "can then be formed where prime knots are classified with odd prime numbers @xmath0 and nonprime knots are classified with nonprime numbers @xmath0 ."
