    "nature s black holes are delineated by mass into two primary classes : supermassive ( @xmath2 ) and stellar mass ( @xmath3 ) , with any falling in - between termed _ intermediate _ mass . for a black hole of any mass",
    ", the no - hair theorem holds that the black hole is uniquely and completely characterized by its mass and its spin angular momentum .",
    "one of the principal challenges in modern astrophysics is to measure and understand the distribution of black hole spins ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "one of the most widely - employed approaches for measuring black hole spin is through modeling fluoresced features in the _ reflection _ spectrum .",
    "the most prominent and recognized such feature is the fe - k@xmath5 line complex @xcite .",
    "the term `` reflection '' here refers to the reprocessing of hard x - ray emission illuminating the disk from above .",
    "the illuminating agent is understood to be a hot corona enshrouding the inner disk , and the hard x - ray emission is attributed to compton up - scattering of the thermal seed photons originating in the disk component ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the compton emission from the corona has a power - law spectrum , which ( generally ) cuts off at high energies .",
    "a portion of this coronal emission returns to the disk and irradiates its outer atmosphere .",
    "the disk s heated outer layer is photoionized , resulting in fluorescent line emission as the atoms de - excite .",
    "in addition to its forest of line features , the reflection continuum produces a broad `` compton hump '' peaked at @xmath6  kev , above the fe edge .",
    "relativity sets doppler splitting and boosting as well as gravitational redshift for the reflection features produced across the disk .",
    "each such feature is accordingly imprinted with information about the spacetime at its point of origin in the disk .",
    "a feature of principal interest is the fe k line whose red wing is used to estimate the disk s inner radius , which in turn provides a constraint on the black hole s spin .",
    "the other primary method for measuring black hole spin is via thermal continuum - fitting @xcite . in this case , the blackbody - like emission from the accretion disk is the component of interest , and spin manifests through the efficiency with which the disk radiates away the rest - mass energy of accreting gas . in effect , the spin is estimated using the combined constraint provided by the disk s observed flux and peak temperature . for this method to deliver an estimate of spin ,",
    "it is necessary to have knowledge of the black hole s mass , the line - of - sight inclination of the spin axis , and the system s distance .",
    "the reflection method is applied to both stellar - mass and supermassive black holes , whereas continuum fitting is predominantly useful for stellar - mass black holes .",
    "both methods rely upon a single crucial foundational assumption : that the inner edge of the accretion disk is exactly matched to the radius of the innermost - stable circular orbit ( isco ) , which is a monotonic function of both mass and spin .",
    "although there is overlap in the set of bh systems which have measurements from each approach , the methods are optimized for opposing conditions ; when a system is most amenable for one method , the other is generally hampered .",
    "for instance , for the thermal state in which continuum - fitting is most adept ( e.g. , @xcite ) , comptonization and reflection are faint compared to the bright disk .",
    "conversely , hard states are dominated by the compton power law and its associated reflection ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and here the thermal disk is quite cool and faint , often so weak that the thermal emission is undetected . as a result",
    ", both methods are not usually applied fruitfully to a single data set ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . instead",
    ", for transient black - hole x - ray binaries , one can apply both methods to observations at distinct epochs capturing a range of hard and soft states as the source evolves .",
    "as consequence of this phenomenological decoupling between thermal and nonthermal dominance , the spectral models describing thermal disk emission versus compton and reflection emission have largely undergone independent development . and as a result the cross - coupling between spectral components has been sparsely studied .",
    "one notable effort by @xcite explored the effect of coronal comptonization on the reflection continuum flux and compton hump , but in general this has gone unexplored .",
    "a handful of similar efforts have taken steps towards self - consistent treatment of the thermal and nonthermal spectral components  notably using eqpair ( @xcite ; e.g. , @xcite ) or compps @xcite , and to lesser degree @xcite .",
    "but an advanced self - consistent approach has not been realized . in this work ,",
    "we examine several important aspects of a self - consistent model , sighted towards measuring black hole spin .    adopting the usual assumption that the hard power - law photons originate in a hot corona that compton scatters thermal disk photons ,",
    "then by extension the reflection photons emerging from the inner disk will likewise undergo the same coronal compton scattering . recognizing this , as a first step towards self - consistency , we begin by examining the impact of coronal comptonization on the reflection spectrum .",
    "this is particularly important for the hard state , in which compton scattering is most pronounced . after touching upon this point , we go on to tackle the larger objective of producing an interlinked disk - coronal spectral model which imposes self - consistency . to connect with observations ,",
    "we apply our model to the peak bright hard - state spectrum of gx  3394 , which is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "these data are among the highest - signal reflection spectra ever studied .",
    "specifically , the data in question correspond to `` box a '' in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , g15 ) , which is comprised of @xmath7-million x - ray counts as collected by _ rxte _",
    "s proportional counter array ( pca ; @xcite ) with a spectral range @xmath8  kev .    in g15 ,",
    "a simple spectral model was adopted , consisting of a cutoff power - law continuum , a component of relativistically broadened reflection ( relxill ) , and a narrow component of distant reflection ( xillver ; i.e. , located far from the regime of strong gravity and also far from the corona ) . in addition , a cosmetic gaussian absorption feature was included in the model near the fe complex at @xmath9  kev .",
    "for further details on the data and modeling procedure adopted , we refer the reader to g15 .",
    "g15 followed the common practices standard in reflection modeling of hard - state data , which do not include the self - consistent effects we introduce here . in g15",
    ", the reflection fits were found to clearly demand that reflection originate from a very small inner radius , a radius of @xmath10 . and yet no thermal emission was required by the fit , although two reflection components were demanded ( the broad and narrow components mentioned above ) .",
    "given the high luminosity of this hard state , can the reflection fit be reconciled with the apparent dearth of thermal disk emission ?",
    "what is the effect of including compton - scattering on the reflection emission ?",
    "can a single reflection component , partially transmitted and partially scattered by the corona , account for the complete signal ?",
    "our work addresses these questions using the gx  3394  data as a touchstone data for examining the impact of a self - consistent framework on black - hole spectral data as a general practice .",
    "section  [ section : model ] describes our overall approach .",
    "we first focus on the impact of compton - scattering on fe lines in reflection spectra in section  [ section : reflectionsc ] , and then discuss a fully self - consistent approach in section  [ section : fullmodel ] . in section  [ section : results ] , we apply this prescription to gx  3394 . finally , a broader discussion and our conclusions are given in sections  [ section : discussion ] and [ section : concs ] .        .",
    "note from the bottom panels that the broad relativistic line profile matches closely that of the compton - downscattered wing for the hard state ( with a steeper @xmath11 ) , but for the soft state ( @xmath12 ) the red wing is narrower . ]    , @xmath13 , and @xmath14  kev for the corona ; @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , log  @xmath18=2 , and a solar abundance of fe for the disk .",
    "the bolometric photon count is identical for both curves ; the apparent enhancement for the black curve in the 1100 kev range is due to the @xmath19 scaling , and is compensated at the lowest energies ( @xmath20 ) at which the green curve is brighter ( and which dominates the photon count ) . ]",
    "we focus on a self - consistent disk - coronal spectral model , in which the thermal disk emission , reflection , and coronal power - law are interconnected in a single framework .",
    "our approach makes several simplifying assumptions .",
    "we firstly assume that the power - law component is generated by comptonization in a thermal corona with no bulk motion , and that the corona is uniform in the sense that its temperature , optical depth , and covering factor are invariant across the inner disk ( i.e. , we ignore any radial gradients that may affect the corona - disk interplay ) .",
    "while we do not impose a particular geometry on the corona , we make the simplifying assumption that the corona emits isotropically . for a chosen geometry , an anisotropy correction ( see e.g. , @xcite ) could be applied to the reflection fraction ; an investigation of such geometry - specific corrections is left for future work .",
    "we assume that the disk is optically thick and geometrically thin and that it terminates at an inner radius @xmath21 .",
    "the boundary condition at the inner radius assumes zero torque .",
    "a detailed consideration of the precise boundary torque is beyond our scope . ] .",
    "spectral hardening ( also commonly termed the `` color correction '' ) describes the relationship between color temperature @xmath22 and effective temperature @xmath23 , and it is defined as @xmath24 .",
    "the correction term @xmath25 is assumed to scale as @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "radiation emitted by the disk that is bent back and strikes the disk due to gravitational lensing ( i.e. , `` returning radiation '' ) is not considered here .",
    "a _ fully _ self - consistent model of the accreting system should include the following couplings between components :    * * disk - corona * : a fraction @xmath27 of thermal accretion disk photons are compton - scattered by the corona into the power - law component .",
    "reflection photons , which originate at the disk surface , will also scatter in the hot corona .",
    "photon conservation here ensures that the compton power - law photons once originated as thermal disk emission . *",
    "* corona - reflection * : the compton - scattered photons which illuminate to the disk give rise to the reflection component .",
    "reflection fraction _ describes the flux of compton - scattered photons directed back to the disk relative to the compton flux that is transmitted to infinity @xcite . properly incorporating _",
    "photon counting _ ensures that the compton - scattered disk photons are conserved and correctly apportioned between components .",
    "for instance , in this case photon conservation links the flux of the observed compton power - law component to the flux of this same component from the vantage point of the disk ( i.e. , as prescribed by the reflection fraction ) . * * disk - reflection * : the inner radius of the disk is tracked by two independent spectral characteristics : the red wing of the relativistic reflection features and the emitting area of the multicolor - blackbody disk .",
    "a self - consistent treatment of these two components is achieved by ensuring that the radius of the thermal emission in the soft state and the reflection component in the hard state mutually constrain the area of the thermal emission for the hard - state disk . at the same time",
    ", photon conservation provides a constraint on the temperature via the disk photon luminosity . * * corona / disk - jet * : although self - consistent modeling of the radio jet can constrain the hard - state geometry ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , the radio jet is beyond our scope is not considered in this work .",
    "we begin our investigation of self - consistent modeling with an in - depth examination of the coupling of the thermal disk photons and the coronal electrons which give rise to the compton power law .",
    "the compton scattering of thermal disk photons into a power - law component has been widely studied ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "however , the impact of compton scattering on the _ non - thermal _ reflection features emitted from the disk s surface is typically ignored , though see @xcite and @xcite .    as a first - order treatment , we can convolve the reflection spectrum with the compton - scattering kernel such as simpl  @xcite .",
    "this model redistributes a scattered fraction @xmath28 of seed photons into a post - scattering distribution via a green s function .",
    "the most basic implementation consists of a one- or two - sided power law distribution @xcite . in this paper",
    "we adopt the two - sided version and go one step further , introducing a more sophisticated implementation of simpl   termed simplcut , which we will use throughout and which we now describe .",
    "simplcut is an extension of the simpl  model that adopts a cut - off power - law shape for the compton component .",
    "it is governed by four physical parameters : the scattered fraction @xmath28 , the spectral index @xmath29 , the high - energy turnover , and the reflection fraction ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath28 is distinct from the optical depth @xmath31 ; @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are fitted , independent of @xmath31 .",
    "this operationally allows for a variable ( non - unity ) covering factor of the corona above the disk .",
    "( @xmath31 can be inferred for a desired geometry using the spectral index and high - energy turnover terms . )",
    "@xmath30 is defined as the number of _ scattered _ photons which return to illuminate the disk ( i.e. , those producing reflection ) divided by the number which reach infinity .",
    "no prescription for angle - dependence is applied , which is equivalent to using the observed power - law flux as proxy for all flux at infinity .    within simplcut",
    "are two options for the scattering kernel . the first kernel , which we adopt throughout unless otherwise specified , is shaped by an exponential cutoff @xmath32 and described by the following green s function , normalized at each seed energy @xmath33 :    @xmath34    the second kernel is based upon nthcomp  @xcite , with electron temperature @xmath35 taking the place of @xmath32 .",
    "this kernel and its implementation are described in appendix  [ append : simplcomp ] , and its shape is illustrated in the right panel of figure  [ fig : comptonization ] .",
    "we opt to use the @xmath32 kernel throughout for the sake of its straightforward comparison with published results ( though see appendix  [ append : simplcomp ] to see our modeling results using both kernels ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : comptonization ] demonstrates simplcut s effect , illustrating the net impact of the corona on a narrow 1  kev line viewed through coronae with a range of settings .",
    "the gray lines depict seed 1  kev photons . for a covering factor of unity ,",
    "the familiar optical depth @xmath31 is related to the scattered fraction by @xmath36 ; electron temperature @xmath35 and high - energy cutoff @xmath32 are approximately matched to one another using an approximate correspondence @xmath37 ( here we have arbitrarily selected @xmath38 for presenting the kernels ) .",
    "the most important feature to note is the prominent downscattering of the line by the hot corona ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is essentially identical between the two kernels .",
    "this is worth particular attention given that the red wing of reflection features are widely employed in estimating the inner - disk radius ( and thereby the spin ) of accreting black holes .",
    "note also that the transmitted portion of the line remains narrow . in considering the compton - scattering of reflection features ,",
    "our prescription using simplcut  greatly improves upon the present _ status quo _ , which is seen in the figure as the narrow gray line .",
    "given that compton scattering produces emission that can contribute to the red wing of a line profile ( notably the fe line ) , this may plausibly impact spin measurements .",
    "we now explore this phenomenon in greater detail . the principal question before us is whether or not compton downscattering can mimic the effect of strong gravity on fluorescent line emission .",
    "this is an important consideration given that the hard states in which reflection is widely studied is associated with strong compton scattering .",
    "as described by eqn .",
    "[ eqn : simplcut ] , the shape of the _ downscattered _ emission is purely a function of @xmath29 ( specifically , the downscattering spectral index is @xmath39 ; also , see @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile , the shape of the red wing of a relativistic line is given principally by the spin of the black hole , but it is also affected tends to decrease the line central peak , while increasing inclination has the opposite effect .",
    "] by the line emissivity @xmath40 and inclination @xmath41 .    for reference , using canonical values @xmath16 and",
    "@xmath42 we find the following correspondence between the shape of a red wing for a relativistic line ( at a given @xmath4 ) and the downscattered wing of a narrow line due to comptonization : @xmath43 matches @xmath44 , @xmath45 matches @xmath46 , @xmath47 matches @xmath48 , and @xmath49 matches @xmath50 .",
    "it therefore follows that _ if _ compton - scattering were being conflated with relativistic distortion , this can be revealed though examination of data spanning a range of @xmath29 , or equivalently , a range of spectral hardness .",
    "ideally , one would examine _ both _ hard and soft ( or steep - power law ; @xcite ) states to maximize this difference .",
    "one expects that any bias introduced by this effect would lead a harder spectrum to fit to a higher value of spin ( or , equivalently , a smaller inner radius ) .",
    "we note that the most recent _ nustar _ reflection studies of cyg x1 find @xmath51 for the soft state and @xmath52 in the hard state @xcite .",
    "the direction of this mismatch in spin ( corresponding a factor @xmath53 difference in @xmath54 ) is consistent with the type of bias one would expect from unmodeled coronal comptonization .",
    "we compare relativistic and compton - scattering effects in figure  [ fig : mimic ] in order to illustrate how the two may be confused . in the top panels , we present illustrative ( simulated ) spectra in black comprised of both broad and narrow reflection components ( analyses using two reflection components being ubiquitous for agn , and commonplace for stellar bhs ) .",
    "the broad component originates in the regime of strong gravity while the narrow component is produced from further away , where relativistic distortions are negligible . in red",
    "we illustrate that closely - matching spectra can be produced by instead compton - scattering a _ single _ narrow reflection component .",
    "the left panels depict a representative hard - state spectrum with spectral index @xmath11 , and the right panels a soft spectrum with @xmath12 .",
    "( we note that many narrow - line seyfert 1s show spectra with @xmath29 in this range , which may indicate that they have also have low @xmath28 . ) in the bottom panels , we show as red dashed lines the shapes of the corresponding compton - scattering profile for a narrow fe line . for each ,",
    "the resulting lineshape is comprised of sharp transmitted and broad scattered components . as a reference , a relativistically broadened fe - line profile for a spin @xmath55",
    "is overlaid as a blue dotted line .",
    "note the close correspondence between the high - spin relativistic line and the compton wing for the hard state in the left - bottom panel ; note also that the compton - scattered lineshape for the soft state is not as broad as a high - spin ( relativistic ) line . in both cases",
    "the upscattered power law from the fe line contributes an excess blueward of the line - center , which is potentially detectable in a general case .",
    "but since here the upscattered line lies significantly below the compton continuum in flux , the effect has minor impact in these examples .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rxscat ] we show the net impact of coronal comptonization on a full relativistic reflection spectrum ( modeled via relxill ) .",
    "this illustrates the generic case in which relativistic reflection features from an accreting black hole in an x - ray binary or agn undergo compton - scattering through the corona .",
    "the comingling of these effects applies the vast majority of x - ray reflection data of black holes , and motivates its presentation here . in the figure",
    ", a green line shows the naked reflection emission from a nonrotating black hole ( @xmath15 ) , i.e. , the reflection component emitted by the disk prior to any coronal compton scattering . after passing through a corona with @xmath56 and @xmath13 , the scattered spectrum is both hardened and also smeared out in energy , with net result shown as the solid black curve .",
    "note for the black curve that the @xmath6  kev compton hump and the red wing of the @xmath57  kev fe line are broader , and that the reflection features appear muted relative to an enhanced ( and harder ) continuum .",
    "as the primary feature of our full spectral model , we ensure a self - consistent linking of the fluxes between disk , compton , and reflection components . incorporating the effects of comptonization by the corona described above , we adopt two basic models which we will employ in fitting gx  3394  spectral data :    * model 1 : *    tbabs(simplcut@xmath58(ezdiskbb+relxill)+xillver ) , and    * model 2 : *    tbabs(simplcut@xmath58(ezdiskbb+relxill ) ) .",
    "model  1 is a reformulation of the typical spectral model employed for many supermassive and stellar black - hole systems ( mentioned in section  [ subsec : downscatter ] ) , which consists of both broad ( relativistic ) and narrow reflection . here",
    ", the narrow reflection is assumed to be produced far from the black hole , for instance in an outer disk rim .",
    "this distant emission would not undergo appreciable compton scattering by a central corona . because of this , we fix xillver s setting for reflection fraction to -1 ( the negative sign merely indicates that the continuum power - law is omitted ) , and fit for its normalization .",
    "accordingly , we note that wherever a fit values of @xmath30 is shown , this refers specifically to the relativistic reflection component .",
    "model  2 is identical to model  1 except that we consider just a single relativistic reflection component .",
    "both include a first - order treatment of reflection and compton scattering ( but not higher order exchanges as , roughly , @xmath59 . ] ) .",
    "although omitted from the descriptions above , when we apply these models to gx  3394  we also include a gaussian absorption line at @xmath9  kev ( this line may be an instrumental artifact rather than physical in origin , and is discussed in great detail in g15 .",
    "tbabs @xcite describes photoelectric absorption as x - rays traverse the line - of - sight interstellar gas column with @xmath60 @xcite , a quantity which we keep fixed throughout our analysis .",
    "ezdiskbb is a spectral disk model . ] for a geometrically thin multi - color accretion disk with zero torque at the inner - boundary @xcite .",
    "importantly , ezdiskbb has been variously shown to recover essentially constant radii from soft black - hole spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) , demonstrating its utility here .",
    "relxill  and xillver  are leading models of spectral reflection @xcite .",
    "the essential difference is that relxill  describes reflection from the inner - disk where gravitational redshift and doppler effects are important , and xillver  is used for unblurred reflection occurring far from the relativistic domain .    in g15",
    ", we concluded that a composite model with a single reflection component , akin to model  2 , did not adequately fit the bright hard state of gx  3394 .",
    "instead , a composite model akin to model  1 ( e.g. , using relxill  and xillver  together ) was very successful .",
    "the spectral fits spanned a range of hard - state luminosities and together demanded that the spin of gx  3394  must be quite high ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the same data also exhibited a preference for quite modest disk truncation ( @xmath62 ) in the hard state , with the inner radius growing slightly larger at lower luminosities .      while the spectral fits in g15 were of high statistical quality",
    ", g15 identified three puzzling aspects of the best - fitting model : ( 1 ) the inner - disk reflection was associated with a startlingly low reflection fraction ( @xmath63 ) , whereas values closer to unity are expected using the updated definition ( v0.4 ) is @xmath64 . while larger , this is still very far from unity . ] ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "( 2 ) a very large fe abundance , @xmath65 times solar , was demanded by the relativistic - reflection component . at the same time , the fe abundance of the xillver  component was incompatible with this large value and was instead consistent with a solar setting .",
    "( 3 ) given the conclusion that the inner disk extends down to  or very near - to  @xmath66 , and given the high luminosity for these hard - state data , the lack of evidence for a thermal disk component in the pca data is surprising .",
    "having incorporated the compton scattering of inner - disk reflection into our model , we now reexamine the most luminous data from g15 .",
    "we explore whether two distinct reflection components are now required ( given the impact of including comptonization ) , and then go on to determine whether the fundamental conclusions of g15 hold up to this more holistic approach .",
    "that is , we will test whether the lack of a detected disk component can be reconciled with the high spin and modest - at - most truncation of the disk in the bright hard state .",
    "in addition , we test whether relxill  alone provides a sufficient model for the reflection signal , or whether the added xillver  component is still required . as well , we consider whether the three puzzles are in any way resolved using our self - consistent model",
    ".    parameters common to relxill  and simplcut  are tied to one another , namely , inclination @xmath41 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath32 . for model  1 ,",
    "xillver s ionization parameter is frozen to log  @xmath67 and the fe abundance is set to unity .",
    "only the normalization for xillver  is free ( operationally , its setting for @xmath30 is fixed to -1 ) . as in g15",
    ", we keep the reflection emissivity frozen to @xmath16 and fit for inner - disk radius while keeping the spin at its maximum value @xmath68 ( see section  [ section : discussion ] ) . as a result of our enforcing photon conservation",
    ", the normalization of relxill  is not free . instead ,",
    "through comparison of the models , we fix the normalization to a fixed function of the disk and reflection parameters , changing in strength principally as @xmath30  is adjusted .",
    "specifically , through exploration , we empirically derived a scaling relation that links the compton power - law emerging from disk ( i.e. , simplcut@xmath58ezdiskbb ) to the illuminating power law ( in relxill in the _ unscattered _ relxill  model . ] ) to within 5% in flux .",
    "this serves as first - order approach to photon conservation , but again does not account for anisotropic redistribution in angle due to scattering or other geometric effects .    to anchor the ezdiskbb temperature and normalization to values corresponding to @xmath66 ,",
    "we turn to the abundant soft - state spectral data of gx  3394  whose compton and reflection contributions are quite minimal .",
    "this is similar to the approach adopted by @xcite in their study of a steep power - law state of gx  3394 , which also employed a thermal spectrum as a reference point .",
    "we choose a @xmath69 count spectrum from march 1 , 1998 ( obsid 30168 - 01 - 01 - 00 ) which has an x - ray flux comparable to that of the g15 box  a data ( see their fig .  1 ) , a factor @xmath70 below gx  3394 s peak brightness .",
    "the temperature and normalization of the disk in question are , respectively @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "owing to the abundant evidence that soft - state disks reach @xmath66 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and that the stable disk radius can be recovered in soft states to within several percent , we employ these numbers as benchmark values for gx  3394 s thermal disk at @xmath73 .",

    "the corresponding results are summarized in table  [ tab : results ] , we present our best fits for both self - consistent models in figure  [ fig : spec ] . the spectral components are shown as solid colored lines and the data are shown in black . the seed disk emission ( i.e. , the emission that would be observed from the bare disk if the corona were transparent ) is shown as a red dotted line .",
    "the sharp cosmetic absorption line near fe is strong and pronounced in model  2 , but suppressed by the xillver  fe - k@xmath145 edge in model  1 .",
    "still , its inclusion in model  1 is significant at a @xmath146 level .",
    "each of models  1 and 2 produce _",
    "relatively _ similar goodness - of - fits to their non - self - consistent counterparts and for both cases give nearly identical patterns of residuals as shown in the bottom panels .",
    "thus , despite the constraints which result from regulating the interplay of the spectral components , our self - consistent framework very successfully models this extremely high - signal spectrum of gx  3394  in its peak bright hard state .    as a result of imposing self - consistency , the low value of @xmath30 obtained in g15 ( i.e. , models  1 g and 2 g ) has increased to several times its original value , now in a range close to unity which is aligned with expectation . in part",
    ", this increase occurs because the appreciable comptonization by the corona ( @xmath147 ) dilutes the equivalent width of the fe line ( and other spectral features ) since scattering a feature acts to blend it into the continuum ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , in order for the ( scattered ) model to match the fe - line strength in the data , @xmath30 necessarily increases . this same effect was noted previously by @xcite . for model  1 ,",
    "surprisingly , the the best - fitting @xmath54 _ decreased _ slightly relative to g15 ( though within @xmath148 limits ) by @xmath149 .",
    "however , for model  2 a new preferred solution emerges with an inner radius @xmath54 that is @xmath150 times larger than for the non - self - consistent model  2 g .",
    "we find that self - consistency does not ameliorate the problem of high fe abundance , only slightly affecting its value . and",
    "based on the significantly better quality - of - fit for the model  1 compared to model  2 , we conclude that the new self - consistent picture has _ not _ removed the need for two distinct reflection components .",
    "in fact , the @xmath151 gap between the two best fits is slightly larger for the self - consistent models .",
    "apart from the question of which model flavor performs best , there are several interesting differences between models  1 and 2 . for model  2 , because larger @xmath54 is preferred , the self - consistent model is matched with correspondingly higher @xmath122 and lower @xmath152 .",
    "model  2 also prefers lower values of the ionization parameter ( by a factor of @xmath153 5 ) and of @xmath28 , but a higher inclination @xmath41 .",
    "most striking , the @xmath1 required for model  1 is less than half that of the reference , soft - state spectrum , whereas for model  2 , @xmath1 is instead _",
    "four_-times larger that for the corresponding soft state !",
    "large @xmath54 resulting in large @xmath1 is a generic property of the self - consistent model because ( from inspection of eqns  [ eq : tdisk2 ] and [ eq : ndisk2 ] ) if @xmath54 is increased for a fixed @xmath1 , the photon flux diminishes and its peak moves to lower energy ; both effects reduce the compton power law s amplitude .",
    "this is similar to the argument presented by @xcite who detailed how the luminosity of the compton component constrains the interplay between the seed photon flux and the corona s covering factor . for a very luminous hard state ( say , @xmath154 of the eddington limit ) ,",
    "large - scale truncation ( @xmath155 ) would imply highly super - eddington values of @xmath1 .",
    "to best examine the impact of the self - consistent model on the inner - radius ( or equivalently , on the resulting spin determination ) , we present fit @xmath151 versus @xmath54 in figure  [ fig : steppar ] . here , solid lines show interpolations of `` steppar '' analyses in xspec  ( a routine which systematically optimizes the fit in sequential steps ) across a range of @xmath54 .",
    "overlaid as point - clouds are random samplings of the mcmc chains . for models 1 and 2 ,",
    "it is evident that imposing self - consistency on the model has the effect of penalizing very low values of @xmath54 , and conversely making high @xmath54 solutions more favorable .",
    "this effect does not significantly alter the best - fitting radius determined from model  1 , which significantly outperforms model  2 .",
    "however , self - consistency does alter the fit landscape , which is a clear indication that the self - consistent constraints can impact results .    in model  2 , which is statistically disfavored ,",
    "the effect of self - consistency is much more pronounced : the @xmath151 surface is double - troughed , with one minimum at @xmath156 ( = 1.8  @xmath157 ) and another at a much larger radius of @xmath158 ( = 6.6  @xmath157 ) .",
    "thus , imposing self - consistency on model  2 drastically changes the solution , favoring substantial truncation and penalizing mild truncation .",
    "the reason self - consistency produces this result is two - fold : ( 1 ) the downscattered compton line emission contributes a flux excess in the same spectral region as the red wing of a relativistically - smeared line , and ( 2 ) the small - radius solution is penalized for requiring a disk component that is not observed . as can be gleaned from figure  [ fig : spec ] , models  1 versus 2 could readily be distinguished through direct detection of the thermal disk using a pile - up free detector with good low - energy sensitivity ( e.g. , _ nicer _ ; @xcite ) .     as the disk inner - radius is varied .",
    "the radius decreases to the right so that truncation is largest to the left .",
    "model 1 is presented in green and model  1 g in blue ; model 2 is shown in red and model  2 g in orange .",
    "the clouds of points show random draws from the mcmc chains .",
    "importantly , self - consistency penalizes small - radius solutions while reducing the penalty on truncated models .",
    "however , only for the disfavored model 2 is the truncated disk preferred over the small - radius solution from g15 ( i.e. , model  2 g ) . ]",
    "our results differ with those of @xcite concerning the effects of comptonization on reflection in the inner disk .",
    "these authors find that strong comptonization @xmath159 has the effect of _ reducing _ the breadth of line features emitted by the disk .",
    "the difference arises from their view of the corona as being centrally concentrated ( though still porous ) so that it very efficiently scatters emission from the inner disk where the gravitationally - broadened red wing is produced , while it is much less efficient at scattering emission from further out in the disk .",
    "we note that there is mixed evidence for a corona with this geometry ; it is variously supported by microlensing data of distant quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) and reverberation studies which require very compact corona @xcite , but it is contested by @xcite on the grounds that a corona so compact would be starved of the seed photons required to produce the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "the contrast between the results of @xcite and ours highlights the importance of understanding coronal geometry and the necessity of investigating compton - scattering effects for a range of geometries in order to better understand systematics in employing reflection spectroscopy to estimate disk radius and spin . at present , these matters are all but unexamined .",
    "@xcite analyze _ xmm - newton _  spectra of gx  3394  using a model similar to ours , with the compton , reflection and disk components modeled using nthcomp , relxill  and a standard multicolor disk . while they cross - linked common parameters between the model components , a significant shortcoming of their approach is not tying the disk seed photons to the large number of photons scattered into the power law .",
    "they also did not account for compton scattering of reflection emission in the corona .",
    "in contrast to our results , they found large - scale disk truncation , with @xmath54 of tens of @xmath157 , and they attributed a tentative detection of @xmath63  kev thermal emission to the thermalization of power - law photons in the disk s atmosphere .",
    "specifically , they claim @xmath54 to be an order of magnitude larger than we find here . we note that if such large values of @xmath54 are correct , then to produce the observed @xmath160 bright hard - state luminosity one would require the associated @xmath1 to be extremely large , several times greater than the _ peak _ @xmath1 of gx  3394 s soft state to match their values when fitting the self - consistent implementations of models  1 and 2 ] .",
    "this is because for a given observed luminosity , when @xmath54 is increased the disk photon luminosity and peak temperature for a given @xmath1 both diminish .",
    "both effects in turn cause the amplitude of the compton power law to drop , and so match the data @xmath1 must be large . if one makes the reasonable assertion that the soft state peaks close to the eddington limit , then large - scale truncation @xmath161 of a bright hard state would generally require a super - eddington mass accretion rate .",
    "@xcite modeled low - luminosity hard - state _ nustar _",
    "spectra of gx  3394 .",
    "they found that the reflection component had a _ harder _ power - law index @xmath29 than the direct continuum component .",
    "the modest difference in the spectral indexes @xmath162 is plausibly explained in our model by the hardening of the reflection spectrum due to compton scattering in the corona .",
    "this can be readily seen in the dashed line of fig .",
    "[ fig : rxscat ] which is harder than the input @xmath13 .",
    "although difficult to discern by eye in figure  [ fig : spec ] , the compton - scattered portion of the reflection component emerges from the corona with a harder spectral index , @xmath163 .",
    "this is because , like the comptonized thermal photons , the comptonized reflection spectrum is boosted in energy when scattering in the corona .",
    "as one would expect , the magnitude of @xmath164 can be shown to grow with @xmath28 .",
    "this hardening explains why the reflection component can be brighter than the compton continuum even if @xmath165 , as it quite apparently is for model  1 in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "this occurs because the compton - scattered reflection is effectively boosted by an additional factor of the `` compton y '' parameter .",
    "in applying our reflection model , we have proceeded under the assumption of maximal spin ( @xmath166 ) , which effectively sets @xmath66 for the thermal state data .",
    "if we had instead assumed any lower value for spin , the tension between the disk component ( given that the data rule out a bright , hot disk ) and reflection component ( which prefers a disk proximate to the horizon ) would have strictly increased , and the fits would have worsened . in this sense , our approach of adopting maximal spin provides a conservative estimate of the importance of self - consistency on the modeling .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated that the comptonization of the fe line and other reflection features in a hot corona can mimic the effects of relativistic distortion  and potentially affect estimates of black hole spin  by producing a downscattered red wing .",
    "this notionally calls into question the prevalence of dual - reflection component spectral models in which one component is in the relativistic domain , and hence strongly blurred , while the other one is assumed to occur far from the black hole and to be correspondingly narrow . the precise shape of a relativistically - distorted line is strongly affected by the spectral index , and hence it changes as a source transitions between hard and soft states .",
    "the comptonization of reflection features is particularly important for hard spectral states because they are dominated by compton - scattered photons from the thermal disk and their byproduct  reflection .",
    "given that thermal disk photons are strongly comptonized in hard states , the associated reflection emission is inevitably strongly comptonized as well .",
    "we have incorporated reflection and comptonization into a self - consistent disk - coronal spectral model that properly conserves photons between the thermal , reflection , and compton components . within this framework , and using two specific models ( models 1 and 2 ) , we analyzed a bright hard - state _ rxte _  spectrum of gx  3394  containing 44-million counts , which was analyzed previously by g15 .",
    "an important constraint was obtained using a soft ( thermal dominant ) state spectrum of gx  3394 at approximately the same luminosity as the g15 data to anchor @xmath66 and the hard - state disk scaling . from our analysis using the self - consistent models , we find that a single compton - scattered reflection component is not preferred for gx  3394 ; as in g15 , the dual - reflection model is strongly favored .",
    "in fact , imposing self - consistency on the dual - reflection model and including the effects of compton scattering on the broad reflection component has minor effect on the reflection best - fitting parameters aside from the reflection fraction @xmath30 which is larger by a factor @xmath167 . at the same time and",
    "importantly , the large change in the inner - disk radius for the disfavored model  2 illustrates that self - consistency has the potential to significantly affect reflection estimates of black hole spin .    additionally , we find that _ bright hard states _ can not be reconciled with _",
    "large - scale _ disk truncation unless either ( 1 ) the mass accretion rate @xmath1 is super - eddington ( well in excess of the peak soft - state @xmath1 ) or else ( 2 ) the hard state power - law component is attributed to another radiation mechanism . this conclusion is a consequence of the photon conservation that is a bedrock of our model . for a fixed @xmath1 one can intuitively understand this result : a disk with large @xmath54 is cool , produces few photons , and has a compton component that peaks at lower energy . at the same time , the corona can not be very small , or else it would require an enormously luminous disk to scatter sufficient photons into the observed power - law component .    for a multi - epoch study of a source ,",
    "the effects of compton scattering on reflection features can be assessed as the source ranges over soft and hard states ; i.e. , as the photon index @xmath29 varies . our model predicts that any bias related to compton scattering of the reflection emission having been omitted from modeling efforts should cause soft - state fits to measure lower spins than found in hard states for the same source ( e.g. , consistent with the findings of the most recent _ nustar _ reflection studies of cyg x1 ) .    as illustrated in figure",
    "[ fig : steppar ] , enforcing self consistency has the potential to very significantly affect estimates of the inner disk radius and spin when modeling a reflection spectrum in the presence of a thermal component .",
    "furthermore , this approach provides new , mutual constraints , e.g. , on @xmath54 and @xmath1 .",
    "self - consistent reflection models therefore deserve exploration and further development .",
    "going forward , given that the power - law component in hard states is strongly comptonized , standard practice should include comptonization of the reflection component in the corona , particularly for studies aimed at constraining @xmath54 or @xmath4 .",

    "in addition to our adopted scattering kernel , which computes the photon redistribution following an exponentially cutoff power law , we have also implemented a kernel `` _ comp _ '' using the comptonization model nthcomp  to numerically compute the scattered distribution at each @xmath33 . in xspec , toggling the energy turnover parameter positive or negative switches between kernels .",

    "the kernels produce similar results .",
    "the spectral index is slightly larger for the _ comp _ versus @xmath32 kernels for both models  1 and 2 .",
