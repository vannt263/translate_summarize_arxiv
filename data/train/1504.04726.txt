    "nowadays various estimates of lyapunov dimension of attractors of generalized lorenz systems @xcite @xmath0 are actively developed . in the work @xcite the following result on the estimate of lyapunov dimension of the generalized lorenz system",
    "is formulated .",
    "[ errortheorem ] let @xmath1 be invariant compact set of the generalized lorenz system .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .    then if it is satisfied one of the following conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 2 .",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 3 .",
    "d = 0 ; and also one of the conditions : 1 .",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 2 .",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath14    then @xmath15 is valid .",
    "however in the proof of this result in @xcite there is an inaccuracy , the consideration of which the present work is devoted .",
    "introduce a notion of lyapunov dimension .",
    "consider , for this purpose , the linearization of dynamical system along a solution @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the @xmath19 jacobian matrix evaluated along the trajectory @xmath20 of system .",
    "the fundamental matrix @xmath21 of linearized system is defined by the variational equation @xmath22    let @xmath23 be singular values of a fundamental matrix @xmath24 ( the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath25 are ordered for each @xmath26 ) .",
    "[ def : le ] the _ lyapunov exponents ( les)_[multiblock footnote omitted ] in the point @xmath27 are the numbers ( or symbols @xmath28 ) @xmath29    following @xcite , introduce a notion of lyapunov dimension .    a local lyapunov dimension of a point @xmath27 in the phase space of dynamical system , generated by equation , is a number @xmath30 where @xmath31 are lyapunov exponents ; @xmath32 $ ] is the smallest natural number @xmath33 such that @xmath34    the lyapunov dimension of invariant set @xmath1 of dynamical system is defined by @xmath35    note that les and lyapunov dimension are invariant under the linear change of variable ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "alongside with widely used numerical methods for estimating and computing the lyapunov dimension there exists analytical approach suggested by g.leonov @xcite that is based on the direct lyapunov method .",
    "let us outline the main theorems describing this approach .",
    "let @xmath36 be the eigenvalues of the following matrix @xmath37    [ theorem : th1 ] given an integer @xmath38 $ ] and @xmath39 $ ] , suppose that there is a continuously differentiable scalar function @xmath40 and a nonsingular matrix @xmath41 such that @xmath42 then @xmath43 .    here",
    "@xmath44 is derivative of the function @xmath45 with respect to the system .",
    "[ theorem : th2 ] assume that there is a continuously differentiable scalar function @xmath45 and a nonsingular matrix @xmath41 such that @xmath46 then any solution of system , bounded on @xmath47 , tends to an equilibrium as @xmath48 .",
    "thus , if condition   holds , then the global attractor of system coincides with its stationary set .",
    "for proving theorem [ errortheorem ] in @xcite it is used above described approach with @xmath49 where @xmath50 and the function @xmath51 where @xmath52 the parameters @xmath53 are chosen in dependence of system parameters in such a way that the conditions of theorem [ theorem : th1 ] or [ theorem : th2 ] are satisfied .",
    "in proving theorem [ errortheorem ] in the work @xcite there is committed an inaccuracy , which does not permit one to obtain a condition for estimating the attractor dimension in the case @xmath54 .",
    "namely , in the proof there is an inaccurate assertion that in the case @xmath55 the inequality @xmath56 yields the inequality @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "let us show that this assertion may be not true .",
    "consider specific values of system parameters and running parameters for which the assertion is not satisfied .",
    "take @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 for which @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "then one has @xmath66 .",
    "condition is satisfied since @xmath67 .",
    "however @xmath68 and consequently for @xmath69 the relation @xmath70 is impossible , i.e. condition under such parameters is not satisfied .    correcting the above - mentioned inaccuracy ,",
    "we obtain the following result .    [ our ] denote by @xmath1 the bounded invariant set of system , involving the point @xmath71 .",
    "suppose that @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and there exists @xmath75 such that the inequality @xmath76 is satisfied .",
    "let @xmath77 @xmath78 where @xmath79 is defined as in .    in this case    1 .",
    "if @xmath80 then any bounded on @xmath81 solution of system tends to a certain equilibrium as @xmath82 ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath83 then @xmath84    for proving theorem [ our ] we uses the matrix @xmath41 , defined according to , and the function @xmath85^{\\frac{1}{2}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath86 exact value of dimension is obtained here from the comparison of dimension estimate and the value of lyapunov dimension in zero point .",
    "the obtained value corresponds to the dimension of global attractor or a ( local ) b - attractor , involving zero equilibrium .",
    "in 2012 g.a .  leonov suggested to consider for the chen and lu systems the following change of variables @xcite @xmath87 with @xmath88 . under this transformation for @xmath89 the chen and lu systems are transformed to the generalized lorenz system with the parameters @xmath90 note that for @xmath91 the chen and the lu systems become linear and their dynamics have minor interest .",
    "thus , without loss of generality , one can assume that @xmath92 .",
    "the transformation with @xmath88 does not change the direction of time for the positive chaotic parameters considered in the works @xcite .",
    "remark that the applying of transformations with the time inversion ( see corresponding discussion of the lorenz , chen and lu systems @xcite ) is not suitable for the study of lyapunov dimension of invariant sets since the absolute values of lyapunov exponents and corresponding local lyapunov dimension in direct and backward time may be different ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "below there are represented domains in the obtained two - dimensional parameter space for which the condition of theorem [ our ] is satisfied . on a plane there",
    "are also shown the points , corresponding to standard parameters of chaotic attractors .",
    "for the lu system such parameters are @xmath93 , and after the change @xmath94 ; for the chen system  @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    2         as shown in figs [ figleft]-[figright ] , nor the lu system nor the chen system standard parameters are situated in the obtained domain .",
    "while lyapunov dimension of the classical lorenz attractor has been obtained analytically , for the chen and lu attractors it is still an open problem . also by numerical simulation",
    "we do not find any chaotic attractor of the chen and lu systems with the parameters from the obtained domains .    applying the same approach ,",
    "we extend the results , obtained in the case @xmath97 in theorem [ errortheorem ] .    [ yangtheorem ] suppose that @xmath98 , and the inequality @xmath99 is satisfied .",
    "let @xmath100 be valid , where @xmath101 is the greater root of the equation @xmath102 where @xmath79 is given according to for @xmath103 .    in this case    1 .",
    "if @xmath104 then any bounded on @xmath81 solution of system tends to a certain equilibrium as @xmath82 ; 2 .   if @xmath105 then @xmath106    consider , for example , the parameters @xmath107 for which there exists a chaotic attractor . for them",
    "@xmath108 , i.e. @xmath11 is satisfied .",
    "however @xmath109 .",
    "thus , for the above - mentioned parameters theorem [ errortheorem ] can not be applied .",
    "but for them theorem [ yangtheorem ] can be applied since for them a higher root of equation is equal to @xmath110 .    ]",
    "similarly it is possible to consider the generalized lorenz system not only with positive @xmath111 , but with the negative ones .    [",
    "main ] suppose that @xmath1 is a bounded invariant set of system @xmath112 involving the point @xmath71 .",
