    "light stops are a quintessential feature of a natural supersymmetric theory  @xcite , being responsible for the cancellation of the dominant higgs mass quadratic divergence coming from the top quark . however , after run 1 of the lhc the possible existence of light stops has been strongly constrained by a suite of dedicated searches by atlas and cms  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in a simplified scenario containing a neutralino as the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and the stop as the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) , with a few gaps and caveats , stop masses as high as @xmath15 gev and lsp masses as high as @xmath16 gev have been excluded  @xcite . still , as is always the case with direct searches , the limits depend strongly on the spectrum and decays of the stops , and there remain open windows in which a light stop can hide from lhc searches .",
    "examples include compressed  @xcite or stealth  @xcite stops and r - parity violating stop decays  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore critical to continue to develop new strategies to directly search for light stops  @xcite .",
    "another opportunity to probe light stops is presented when the stop is long lived , which naturally occurs in a number of motivated scenarios .",
    "indeed , provided the stop does not have an _ unsuppressed _",
    "2-body decay , stop pairs produced through gluon fusion can form a stoponium bound state due to the coulombic attraction mediated by the strong force  @xcite .",
    "once the bound state is formed , it can decay via annihilation to @xmath17 and @xmath4 , leaving a distinctive resonance signature .",
    "as we will emphasize below , the branching ratios to these final states depend essentially on one parameter , the trilinear higgs - stop - stop ( @xmath18 ) coupling .",
    "therefore , provided there is enough time for the stoponium to form and annihilate decay , the signature is independent of the details of the light susy spectrum and thus offers a highly complementary probe to direct stop searches .    in this paper",
    "we will use the null results from @xmath19 and @xmath4 resonance searches to constrain the production of stoponium during the first run of the lhc and in turn derive new limits on light stops . assuming the stop is sufficiently long - lived , constraints on stoponium production in the @xmath0 , @xmath20 , and @xmath2 channels _ alone _ limit stops lighter than @xmath21 gev for _ any _ value of the stop mixing angle and heavy stop mass @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , for mostly left - handed light stops , the @xmath10 searches constrain light stops up to about 170 gev .",
    "we will also present projections for 14 tev lhc with low ( 30 fb@xmath23 ) and high ( 3 ab@xmath23 ) luminosities .",
    "one new aspect of our study which has not been emphasized in the literature is the interplay between stoponium searches and other indirect constraints on light stops . in particular , since the stoponium branching ratios depend primarily on the @xmath18 coupling , our new constraints are highly complementary to those suggested by higgs coupling measurements .",
    "light stops with a large coupling to the higgs boson significantly alter higgs production in the gluon - gluon fusion channel and are already strongly constrained except for a `` blind spot '' in the parameter region where the @xmath18 coupling is small  @xcite . on the other hand , the @xmath0 resonance signature of stoponium",
    "is enhanced in the region where the @xmath18 coupling is small . combining both constraints ,",
    "we can rule out the existence of light stops up to about 130 gev independently of the other parameters in the stop sector . besides the interplay with higgs couplings , we will also explore the impact of other indirect constraints on light stops , including vacuum stability and electroweak precision data .",
    "we also discuss the consequences of our results for two motivated scenarios in which stoponium annihilation decays are relevant .",
    "the first is the canonical r - parity conserving case with a bino lsp and a stop nlsp . for @xmath24",
    "the stoponium annihilation decays are visible , providing a clean and unambiguous probe of light stops which is independent of possible kinematic degeneracies or model dependencies of stop branching ratios .",
    "second , we discuss the case of a stop lsp decaying via the r - parity violating @xmath12 operator to two jets , which is challenging to probe directly due to the large qcd backgrounds .",
    "again , stoponium can provide a clear - cut test of light stops in this scenario .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that there is a potentially large source of theoretical uncertainty present in the stoponium production cross section coming from the assumed potential model and contribution of the excited states to the signal .",
    "the limits we present here are based on the empirical quarkonia potential model of hagiwara et al .",
    "@xcite . furthermore , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is likely that higher @xmath6-wave stoponium states contribute to the resonance signals , and we therefore include the first two states in our estimate . as we will argue below , we believe our assumptions in this regard are conservative , but we will also discuss in detail how different choices affect the stoponium production cross section and the resulting limits .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : stoponium ] with a brief review on the production and decay of stoponium at hadron colliders .",
    "our new limits and future projections from lhc resonance searches on several benchmark scenarios for each diboson channel are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : limits ] .",
    "the current limits from stoponium and other indirect constraints on the full stop sector parameter space are combined in sec .",
    "[ sec : interplay ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : scenarios ] we discuss the implications of our results on two motivated scenarios containing lights stops .",
    "section  [ sec : outlook ] presents our conclusions and outlook .",
    "finally we include several appendices [ app : param]-[app : searches ] which collect and summarize our conventions for the stop sector , the indirect constraints on light stops , the stop decay widths , our procedure for limit extrapolation , and the lhc diboson resonance searches used in our analysis .",
    "in this work we will investigate the annihilation decay signatures of the @xmath6-wave @xmath25 stoponium bound state , @xmath26 , at the lhc .",
    "these signatures result from the following processes : @xmath27 searches for stoponium resonances provide a highly complementary probe of light stops , testing different assumptions about susy spectra and parameters than both direct searches for stops and indirect probes such as higgs coupling measurements , precision electroweak data , and vacuum stability constraints . in particular , direct searches for stops ( and other new particles )",
    "are inherently model dependent , requiring assumptions about the superpartner spectrum and stop decay chains .",
    "in contrast , the limits and projections we will derive for stoponium will depend on two _ different _ assumptions : 1 ) the stop does not have an unsuppressed 2-body decay , and 2 ) the value of the trilinear higgs - stop - stop coupling . as we will discuss",
    "shortly , the first assumption of a narrow stop width is actually satisfied in a number of interesting scenarios .",
    "the second assumption on the value of the @xmath28 coupling , which is determined by the stop sector masses and mixing angle , will govern the stoponium branching ratios for the various final states in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stoponium ] ) .    in this section",
    "we will collect the relevant ingredients entering into our study of stoponium .",
    "our analysis relies on a number of previous works  @xcite , notably those of martin and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "next we describe in more detail the basic requirements for observable stoponium annihilation decays . following this",
    "we will review the production of stoponium at the lhc and the stoponium decay branching ratios .    before beginning ,",
    "let us note here that we will work exclusively in this paper with the physical stop parameters @xmath29 , in which @xmath30 @xmath31 denotes the lightest ( heaviest ) physical stop state , and a mixing angle @xmath32 corresponds to a purely left - handed ( right - handed ) stop .",
    "we will also restrict to the decoupling limit .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix  [ app : param ] for our stop sector conventions .",
    "what conditions are required for the distinctive resonance signatures of stoponium to be observable ?",
    "provided they are kinematically accessible , stop pairs will be copiously produced in @xmath5 collisions . however ,",
    "whether or not the bound state forms and subsequently decays via the annihilation processes in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stoponium ] ) depends on the natural width of the stop .",
    "the bound state formation time is on the order of the inverse binding energy which , assuming a coulombic potential , is given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34^{-1}$ ] is the `` bohr radius '' of the system . therefore , stoponium will form provided the natural width of the stop is smaller than the binding energy .",
    "subsequently , the decay of the bound state may proceed either through the prompt decay of the constituent stop or through the annihilation decays .",
    "for instance , if the @xmath18 coupling is small the dominant annihilation decay is to a pair of gluons , with partial width ( see also sec .  [",
    "sec : branching ] below ) @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the radial wavefunction at the origin , for which we employ the parameterization in ref .  @xcite . for @xmath37 gev , the factor @xmath38 gev ,",
    "leading to a partial width @xmath39 mev in the light stop mass range of interest . if the annihilation decay width dominates over the natural stop width we can potentially observe the stoponium through its resonance signature .    in summary we require , @xmath40 in practice , since the annihilation decay width is typically smaller than the binding energy , it sets the upper bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond ] ) .",
    "in fact , these conditions are satisfied in a number of interesting of scenarios and over a wide range of model parameters , particularly when the stops are light .",
    "we will examine two such scenarios in section  [ sec : scenarios ] .      at leading order ( lo ) the production of stoponium in @xmath5 collisions at the lhc proceeds via gluon - gluon fusion , with a cross section given by  @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the gluon parton luminosity as a function of @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the squared center - of - mass energy , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pab ] ) in appendix [ app : extrap ] . the partial decay width for @xmath45",

    "@xcite . to account for these corrections",
    "we will use the results of ref .",
    "in particular , we extract the cross section prediction from their fig.9 and furthermore estimate a conservative @xmath46 scale uncertainty on this prediction from their fig.7  @xcite .",
    "we can also reasonably estimate a @xmath47 pdf uncertainty in the mass range of interest , similarly to that for higgs production via gluon - gluon fusion  @xcite .",
    "there are likely larger sources of theoretical uncertainties than the qcd scale uncertainty , which are , however , difficult to quantify .",
    "notice in particular that the cross section in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lo ] ) depends on the value of the stoponium wavefunction at the origin squared , @xmath48 , through eq .",
    "( [ eq : gg ] ) , and our imprecise understanding of this matrix element potentially provides a significant source of uncertainty .",
    "@xcite employs the @xmath49 mev parameterization of the wavefunction at the origin from the study of hagiwara et al .",
    "this parameterization is based on an empirical quarkonia potential model , which deviates significantly from the pure coulombic form at large @xmath50 due to the effect of higher order qcd corrections .",
    "for instance , the prediction for @xmath48 for the ground state is smaller by roughly a factor of 2 in comparison to that obtained from a coulomb potential , suggesting that our estimates of the production rate are conservative .",
    "@xcite also present @xmath51 mev and @xmath52 mev parameterizations , which lead to a @xmath53 reduction or enhancement in the stoponium production rate , respectively , giving some sense of the uncertainties involved .",
    "we note that the study of ref .",
    "@xcite is 25 years old , and given the significant experimental and theoretical progress in the studies of quarkonia and qcd in the interim , it would be extremely useful to perform a modern analysis in the spirit of  @xcite , with the particular aim of assessing the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "another source of uncertainty in the prediction is the contribution of higher @xmath6-wave stoponium states to the annihilation decay signals .",
    "@xcite includes the first two states in their calculation , but reasonably argues that higher states will likely add to the signal , and in this way our estimates of the production rate are likely conservative . in figure",
    "[ fig : xs ] we display the stoponium production cross section at the lhc under several different assumptions regarding the potential and contribution of excited states .",
    "needless to say , it would be extremely interesting to study the stoponium system in more detail to both quantify the uncertainty due to the modelling of the bound state potential as well as understand the phenomenological consequences of the higher radial states .",

    "<S> remarkably , we find that stoponium searches are highly complementary to direct collider searches and indirect probes of light stops such as higgs coupling measurements . using an empirical quarkonia potential model and including the first two @xmath6-wave stoponium states , we find that in the decoupling limit @xmath7 gev is excluded for _ any _ value of the stop mixing angle and heavy stop mass by the combination of the latest resonance searches and the indirect constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8 searches are the most complementary to the indirect constraints , probing the stop `` blind spot '' parameter region in which the @xmath9 trilinear coupling is small . </S>",
