    "when the skin is pinched , wrinkles appear quite early on its surface .",
    "the same phenomenon occurs when the skin is sheared , i.e. pinched with one finger moving in one direction and the other fixed or moving in the opposite direction . in fact , pinching is one of the tests performed by dermatologists and surgeons @xcite when trying to assess the direction of greatest tension @xcite in the neighborhood of a site of interest .",
    "sometimes called _ lines of cleavage _ @xcite , the orientations of the lines of greatest tension are crucial to the way a scar heals . for a cut across the lines ,",
    "the lips of a wound will be pulled away from one another during the healing process , while they will be drawn together if the cut has occurred parallel to the lines . in one case",
    "the resulting scar can be quite unsightly , in the other it is almost invisible . in this paper",
    "we investigate the mechanical stability of two toy models for the human skin under shear in its plane , and view the onset of small - amplitude , unstable solutions as a prototype for skin wrinkling .         of course , skin is a complex , multi - faced organ , and it is not easily , nor perhaps realistically , modeled . in section [ section2 ] , we first view it as an initially isotropic , neo - hookean layer of finite thickness .",
    "although a two - layered model of skin would be more realistic , it would greatly complicate the theoretical analysis of the shear instability properties .",
    "therefore , we prefer to consider an epidermis of vanishing thickness on top of a hyperelastic dermis , by defining a proper surface elastic energy . in other words",
    "we let one of the layer s faces be a material curve endowed with intrinsic elastic properties associated with extensibility , but no bending stiffness ( see @xcite for a rigorous exposition of such elastic coatings ) .",
    "we account for the lines of greatest tension by imposing a finite plane pre - stretch in a given direction ; in other words , we simulate those lines through _ strain - induced anisotropy_. then we investigate whether surface energy and pre - stretch promote or attenuate the appearance of wrinkles when the layer is subject to simple shear in the direction of the cleavage lines .    in section [ shear instability of a fibre - reinforced skin tissue ] , we then view skin as being intrinsically _ anisotropic _ that is , we switch to the point of view that lines of greatest tension are due to the presence of families of parallel bundles of stiff collagen fibres imbedded in a softer elastin matrix . the introduction of even the simplest anisotropy  transverse isotropy due to a single privileged direction  complicates the equations of incremental instability greatly , and we thus restrict attention to a homogeneous solid without surface tension .",
    "we also omit finite - size effects by considering a half - space instead of a layer , and thus by focusing on the biot surface instability phenomenon @xcite . here , the anisotropic contribution to the stored energy is that recently proposed by ciarletta et al.@xcite .",
    "its polyconvexity ensures good properties from the physical point of view , such as strong ellipticity in compression , in contrast to the standard reinforcing model used recently by destrade et al.@xcite for the same stability study .",
    "first we consider an isotropic elastic material of finite thickness @xmath0 , undergoing an homogeneous shear . in order to mimic the response of human skin",
    ", we incorporate the presence of a residual stretch @xmath1 along the main cleavage lines , so that the base deformation field reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the current position of a material point which was at @xmath4 in the reference configuration , and @xmath5 is a constant .",
    "hence , we see that the deformation can be decomposed as a plane stretch of amount @xmath1 followed by a simple shear of amount @xmath5 , with deformation gradient @xmath6 written as @xmath7    we note that the layer s thickness @xmath0 remains unchanged through the deformation . for simplicity , we take the layer to be made of an isotropic neo - hookean incompressible material with a surface energy at the free boundary @xmath8 , so that its total strain energy @xmath9 reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the shear modulus , @xmath12 is the left cauchy - green deformation tensor , @xmath13 is the surface tension coefficient , @xmath14 is the elastic shear modulus per surface unit , and the comma denotes partial derivative .",
    "this is akin to endowing one of the material boundary of the layer with a surface energy with a term proportional to changes in area ( as is often done in fluid mechanics , see e.g. @xcite ) , and another contribution depending on the elastic deformation of the surface .",
    "this last term is proportional to a stretch measure of the surface deformation tensor , which is chosen for invariance requirements because we consider this elastic layer as a hemitropic film @xcite .",
    "now from the constitutive assumptions in eq.([const ] ) , we find that @xmath15 , the cauchy stress tensor corresponding to the large deformation in eq . is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a lagrange multiplier due to the constraint of incompressibility .",
    "writing that the boundary at @xmath18 is traction - free fixes the value of @xmath17 as @xmath19 .",
    "straightforward calculations reveal that principal stretches of the deformation field in eq.([def ] ) are @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) given by @xcite @xmath22 and that the eulerian principal axes @xmath23 are obtained after an anti - clockwise rotation of angle @xmath24 of the in - plane coordinate axes about the @xmath25 axis , where @xmath26 from eq .",
    ", we note that @xmath27    we now look for a perturbation solution in the neighbourhood of the large deformation , using the theory of incremental deformations @xcite . hence we call @xmath28 the incremental displacement field , for which the incremental incompressibility condition imposes that @xmath29 the constitutive equation for the components of the incremental nominal stress @xmath30 reads in general as @xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the increment in the lagrange multiplier , and @xmath33 is the fourth - order tensor of instantaneous moduli , i.e. the push - forward of the fixed reference elasticity tensor . in the absence of body forces",

    "it is easy to show that a solution in the form of eq.([sep ] ) is given by @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 are yet arbitrary constants , and @xmath52 is fixed by imposing eqs.([pi ] ) , as @xmath53 using eqs .",

    "( [ stroh ] ) , and solved numerically using an iterative technique . as shown in figures  [ fig : criticalalpha ] and [ fig : criticalalpha * ] , we have found that the presence of fibres always lowers the shear threshold at which geometrical instability happens : the stiffer the fibres , the earlier the wrinkles appear in shear . considering that anisotropic stiffness of skin greatly",
    "increase with ageing @xcite , our results are in agreement with the fact that older skin wrinkles earlier when pinched .",
    "the presence of a universal point of instability at shear threshold @xmath174 when the fibres are aligned with the direction of greatest stretch @xmath62 , irrespective of the value of @xmath173 , can be observed on figures [ fig : criticalalpha ] and [ fig : criticalalpha * ] .",
    "this anchor point is present for @xmath175 no matter how stiff the fibres are compared to the matrix ( in the appendix we identify its origin . )",
    "however , it represents a very special case of shear , and when we move away from the region of influence of this point , we notice that all bifurcation curves indicate a significant lowering of the shear threshold of instability ( as soon as the fibres become at least as stiff as the matrix , @xmath176 ) . in experimental tests ( see e.g. n annaidh et al.@xcite ) , collagen fibres in human skin are determined to be at least 500 times stiffer than the elastin matrix .",
    "we may thus deduce that our model , away from the anchor point , predicts that surface instability will occur early , at low levels of shear , in line with the visual observations of figures [ skin1 ] and [ skin2 ] .    in conclusion",
