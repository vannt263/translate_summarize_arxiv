    "the stimulated raman transition is an extremely powerful tool for laser manipulation of cold atoms and ions . by coupling long - lived states via , but never populating , radiative states , experimenters can emulate near - ideal two - level quantum systems with no significant decay @xcite .",
    "this technique has been used to measure sub - linewidth features @xcite and to construct atomic interferometers which , by exploiting photon recoil , create spatially separated atomic wave packets which are sensitive to gravity @xcite or fundamental constants @xcite . the effective two - level system , which emerges from the raman problem , can exhibit behavior such as rabi flopping @xcite , can be used for experiments such as ramsey interferometry @xcite , and can provide the qubits for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "sequences of raman pulses can be used to craft arbitrary superpositions in systems with numerous metastable states @xcite and to prepare such systems in particular states prior to coherent manipulation @xcite .",
    "raman processes have also been used to cool atomic samples to far below the photon recoil limit @xcite .    throughout the literature ,",
    "when the raman transition is discussed , the level structure of the atom is often approximated to three levels  two metastable states and one intermediate ( radiative ) state .",
    "the raman problem is solved for this prototypical case and then extended , without proof , to include the multilevel structure of the atom by summing over the various possible routes ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here , by including multiple routes from the outset , we confirm that this simple approach is correct , show how an expression for the lightshift emerges naturally from this treatment , and show that the system behaves as a two - level system with an effective coupling strength and an effective detuning .",
    "there is much existing work related to this problem .",
    "the three - level ( single intermediate state ) off - resonant case has been treated @xcite , there have been extensions to four levels @xcite , and the general multilevel problem has been recast into `` serial '' and `` parallel '' cases @xcite .",
    "it has never been shown rigorously , however , that the three - level case can be extended in the way so often assumed . in the following ,",
    "we use the semiclassical approach but alternatively one might consider the jaynes ",
    "cummings model  @xcite .",
    "this article is structured as follows .",
    "we first describe , in , the raman transition in a three - level system and we show how this can be generalized to include multiple intermediate states ; details of the lengthly calculation are confined to the appendix .",
    "we then derive , in , expressions for the behavior of the quantum - mechanical amplitudes in the general , off - resonance case . in we",
    "show how these results can be applied to alkali - metal atoms , and we conclude in .",
    "the simplest system in which a raman transition may be driven is the three - level `` @xmath0 '' system , illustrated in , in which two long - lived ground states are coupled via a radiative upper state which , because the single - photon detuning is sufficiently large , is never significantly populated .",
    "a simple three - level `` @xmath0 '' system , in which a raman transition between states @xmath1 and @xmath2 is driven by `` pump '' and `` stokes '' fields via intermediate state @xmath3 .",
    "for each field , the coupling strength and frequency are shown in parentheses , and frequencies are chosen to be near two - photon resonance : @xmath4 ; @xmath5 .",
    "the single - photon detuning @xmath6 is large compared with the couplings , @xmath7 , and , in this illustration , is negative : @xmath8 .",
    "the two - photon detuning @xmath9 is small compared with the separation between the ground states and , in this illustration , is also negative.,width=302 ]    we label the states of the system by @xmath10 , with states @xmath1 and @xmath3 coupled by the `` pump '' field of strength @xmath11 and frequency @xmath12 , and states @xmath2 and @xmath3 coupled by the `` stokes '' field of strength @xmath13 and frequency @xmath14 . using the usual correspondence between bra  ket and column vector notation ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "*  ii - c ) ) , the hamiltonian for this system may be represented by the following matrix ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath15here , as in standard treatments , we assume there is no coupling between states @xmath1 and @xmath3 by the stokes field , or between states @xmath2 and @xmath3 by the pump field",
    ".    this hamiltonian can be simplified by making the rotating wave approximation and transforming to the interaction picture .",
    "this yields a slowly varying hamiltonian , @xmath16 where the pump frequency @xmath17 is detuned from single - photon resonance by @xmath6 , and the difference between the pump frequency and the stokes frequency @xmath18 is offset by @xmath9 from the two - photon resonance @xmath19 .",
    "we now extend this interaction picture to include multiple levels and define the hamiltonian @xmath20 to be    @xmath21    the second part of the subscript , @xmath22 , denotes the level to which the pump or stokes field couples .",
    "note that the oscillation frequency is the same for each stokes term because this depends on the difference in the frequency of the fields and not on the bohr energy of the intermediate level .",
    "however , the single - photon detunings do depend on the intermediate level bohr frequencies , but we now make the approximation that the detuning is large compared with the separation of these intermediate levels , and hence @xmath23 .    in this limit , the above hamiltonian describes a raman system and we expect to see oscillations of population between the ground states .",
    "we solve the schrdinger equation with this hamiltonian by using unitary transformations to find a basis where the time evolution of the states is simple and the transformed hamiltonian is diagonal .",
    "when one makes such a conversion between bases , is it possible to find an equivalent schrdinger equation with a transformed hamiltonian  @xcite : if @xmath24 , then @xmath25 where @xmath26    for the multistate hamiltonian @xmath20 in , we choose the operator @xmath27 to be the matrix of eigenvectors ; the first term @xmath28 is thus the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues . in the appendix ,",
    "we detail a procedure to find the eigensystem of this hamiltonian ; we find two eigenvectors which are superpositions of these ground states , and @xmath29 more which are superpositions of the remaining intermediate levels .",
    "these @xmath29 upper states are decoupled from the ground states and so we ignore them in the following treatment .",
    "the difference between the eigenvalues for the two ground state eigenvectors is @xmath30 where , for conciseness , we have represented the couplings as vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 with components @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively , and have used vector notation for dot products and norms .",
    "this oscillation frequency is composed of a coupling strength @xmath35 and a detuning @xmath36 , via @xmath37 , analogously to a two - level system : @xmath38 the detuning @xmath36 is readily identified as the lightshift and we justify this in the next section .",
    "the operator which describes the transformation from the bare ground states to these dressed ground states can , because of normalization , be written as a rotation : @xmath39 and the angle @xmath40 is defined by @xmath41 .",
    "this treatment is sufficient for the on two - photon resonance case , where @xmath42 , but in general the effective hamiltonian @xmath43 also contains a time - derivative second term , originating from the time - dependence of the operator @xmath27 .",
    "away from the two - photon resonance , where @xmath44 , we find the following slowly varying , but nevertheless time - dependent , effective hamiltonian : @xmath45",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath43 in has the same form as that for the simple two - level problem in the interaction picture and with the rotating - wave approximation .",
    "we can , therefore , use familiar tools to solve this problem .",
    "first , we transform to find a time - independent hamiltonian using the operator @xmath46 in : @xmath47 next , analogously to the dressed - states approach , we rotate by an angle @xmath48 ( thus defining @xmath49 ) where @xmath50 to find a diagonal hamiltonian @xmath51 .",
    "the difference between the diagonal elements of @xmath51 corresponds to the phase evolution frequency @xmath52 of the states in this basis . as in the previous section",
    ", we see that this oscillation frequency is composed of a coupling strength @xmath35 and a modified effective detuning @xmath53 : @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the detuning relative to @xmath36 , which was previously identified as the lightshift .",
    "we now relate the pure phase evolution in this doubly dressed basis to the evolution of the bare states by concatenating the transformations that led us to this final hamiltonian : @xmath56 and @xmath57 , or @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the ground- and excited - state components of the doubly dressed wave function @xmath61 and the bare ( interaction picture ) wave function @xmath62 , respectively . finally , the time evolution of the doubly dressed states is simply @xmath63    using we can find the dressed state initial conditions @xmath64 in terms of the bare state initial conditions @xmath65 .",
    "using these values , we can then use to find the dressed state coefficients at some later time . finally , we can invert the transformation in to find the time evolution of the bare state amplitudes .",
    "the time dependence of the bare state coefficients @xmath66 is readily calculable from the procedure described above and is stated here for completeness :    [ eqn : explicita01 t ] @xmath67\\nonumber\\\\ & \\phantom{=}\\quad~~+a_1(0)\\ , i{\\frac{\\omega_\\text{d}}{\\widetilde{\\omega}_\\text{d}}}\\sin{\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\widetilde{\\omega}_\\text{d } t\\right)}\\biggr)\\,;\\phantom{e^{-i\\delta t}}\\\\   a_1(t)&=\\biggl(a_1(0)\\left[\\cos{\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\widetilde{\\omega}_\\text{d } t\\right)}+i{\\frac{\\delta_\\text{d}}{\\widetilde{\\omega}_\\text{d}}}\\sin{\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\widetilde{\\omega}_\\text{d } t\\right)}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & \\phantom{=}\\quad~~+a_0(0)\\ , i{\\frac{\\omega_\\text{d}}{\\widetilde{\\omega}_\\text{d}}}\\sin{\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\widetilde{\\omega}_\\text{d } t\\right)}\\biggr)e^{-i\\delta t}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    hence the system behaves as a two - level system with the coupling strength @xmath68 and detuning @xmath55 , relative to the effective detuning @xmath36 .",
    "this justifies our previous identification of @xmath36 with the lightshift .",
    "the complete , but cumbersome , formulas in describe the behavior of the bare - state amplitudes in terms of the bare state initial conditions .",
    "if , instead , we express this evolution in terms of the initial values in the doubly dressed basis , we see clearly that the evolution is composed of a time - independent offset and an oscillation : @xmath69 the population @xmath70 in state @xmath1 therefore oscillates with peak - to - peak amplitude no greater than @xmath71 $ ] which , expressed in terms of the effective coupling strength and detuning , is @xmath72 this envelope function describes a power - broadened lorentzian , centered on the light shifted frequency difference between the ground states .",
    "this expression represents the maximum possible population transfer , and any oscillation will be contained within this envelope .",
    "a few specific cases are provided here for illustration .",
    "first , for @xmath73 and @xmath74 we recover the well - known results for the three level problem .",
    "next we note two interesting cases : for @xmath75 , the lightshift @xmath36 is zero . on the other hand , for @xmath76 ,",
    "the rabi frequency @xmath35 is zero .    if , as in this last case , the coupling vectors @xmath31 and @xmath77 are orthogonal , then the transition is not driven .",
    "examples include the trivial case where there is no intermediate state to which both ground states are coupled and the case where there are states to which both are coupled , but where these individual coupling strengths sum to zero . however , unless the vectors are orthogonal , it is possible to adjust the pump and stokes field strengths to ensure the norms of the vectors are equal , and hence that the lightshift is zero .",
    "our approach relies on the slow time - dependence of the interaction - picture hamiltonian : we require that the system is near two - photon resonance , as previously stated , and that there is no coupling of state @xmath1 by the stokes field or of state @xmath2 by the pump field .",
    "if present , these cross - coupling terms would cause the off - diagonal terms in @xmath20 to oscillate in amplitude as well as phase , and the treatment in the appendix would no longer be valid .    for our treatment to be valid , it must therefore be possible to identify clearly which field is resonant with which transition ( see refs @xcite and @xcite for further discussion ) .",
    "first , the detuning must be such that no field is close to a single - photon resonance : @xmath78 and @xmath79 . additionally , the coupling strength must be sufficiently small that each ground state can be resolved : @xmath80 .",
    "if this last condition is violated , the system may still appear ramanlike and exhibit coherent behavior , but it is not described adequately by the treatment in this article .",
    "we are able to calculate the rabi frequency and lightshift for two states @xmath1 and @xmath2 coupled via a number of upper states .",
    "a common embodiment of this situation is the coupling of two ground hyperfine states via a manifold of upper hyperfine states in an alkali - metal atom .",
    "indeed , there typically exists many such pairs of states , but , as ensured by conservation of angular momentum , one state is raman coupled to at most one other state ; hence , the total system may be treated as a collection of independent pairwise couplings .    as a typical example , consider the raman transition between the ground hyperfine states , via the radiative upper states , in atomic cesium .",
    "the pump and stokes fields , both tuned near to the @xmath81 transition at @xmath82 , couple states @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively , to the @xmath85  manifold , and have a frequency difference near to the hyperfine splitting of @xmath86  @xcite . the two ground states and the intermediate states are @xmath87 where @xmath88",
    "are the polarizations of the co - propagating pump and stokes fields and correspond to linear and left and right circular polarizations , respectively ; @xmath89 labels the zeeman sublevel , corresponding to the projection of the total angular momentum @xmath90 along the quantization axis provided by an external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "linear polarization , in this context , refers specifically to the case of the light electric field parallel to the quantization axis ; if these axes are orthogonal , the light field interacts with the atom as though it were a superposition of left and right circular polarizations .",
    "the coupling strengths @xmath91 depend not only on the light intensities but also on the dipole matrix element for the transition . using the wigner - eckart theorem  @xcite we can split the overlap integral needed to find this dipole matrix element and extract from it a purely geometrical term @xmath92 , leaving a term which embodies the other physical details of the transition : @xmath93 the `` reduced '' matrix element , denoted by double bars @xmath94 , depends on many details of the atom , including nuclear mass , and is not easily calculated ; it can , however , be found experimentally from measurements of the upper - state lifetime , as described by loudon  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 2.57 ) ) and demtrder  @xcite : @xmath95 the second part is the product of geometrical terms : @xmath96 where the arraylike symbol in parentheses @xmath97 is the wigner 3-@xmath98 symbol and the similar term in braces @xmath99 is the wigner 6-@xmath98 symbol  @xcite ; both are closely related to the clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "this relation is described in detail by edmonds  @xcite .",
    "the two states coupled by the raman interaction are both in @xmath100 so , in the calculations that follow , it is only this geometrical term which is relevant .",
    "we imagine the atom in a region of uniform magnetic field and consider an experiment where it is possible to adjust the frequency difference in order to sweep across transitions between various zeeman sublevels .",
    "the properties which affect the dipole moment are the various quantum numbers : the nuclear spin @xmath101 ; the electron angular momentum @xmath102 or @xmath103 ; the total angular momentum @xmath104 to @xmath105 via @xmath106 ; and the aforementioned projection @xmath89 of @xmath90 along the quantization axis .",
    "the coupling strength for a dipole transition between states @xmath10 and @xmath107 is proportional to the electric field  @xcite : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the dipole operator . as above , we can extract a geometrical term and , using the vector notation , @xmath110 hence , the relative properties of each of the zeeman sublevels are determined by the geometrical terms @xmath111 . if we revisit the equations for the coupling strength ( ) and the lightshift ( ) , we see that these terms appear as @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "thus : @xmath114    it is simple to calculate these factors for a given initial state and pair of polarizations to examine how the lightshift and the coupling strength depend on the strength of the applied fields .",
    "we find that @xmath115 , for transitions from @xmath116 to @xmath117 , driven by light with polarization @xmath118 , are , for an alkali - metal atom with nuclear spin @xmath119 , given by    @xmath120    where @xmath121 for the @xmath122 transition and @xmath123 for the @xmath81 transition .",
    "the pump vector @xmath124 couples from the lower hyperfine state and corresponds to the negative branch ( @xmath125 ) ; the stokes vector @xmath126 couples from the upper hyperfine state and corresponds to the positive branch ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "using these expressions and , one may easily calculate the lightshift for a given raman transition in any alkali - metal atom .",
    "we now turn to the coupling strength @xmath35 which , for equal polarizations @xmath128 , is symmetrical about @xmath129 .",
    "we find @xmath130 for the @xmath122 and @xmath81 transitions , where @xmath131 is given above .",
    "if we now break this symmetry by choosing , for example , @xmath132 , we find @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the @xmath135 triangular number ( @xmath136 ) . the dependence of coupling strength on @xmath137 level is illustrated in .",
    ".scaling of the coupling strength and the lightshift for the transition @xmath138 to @xmath139 for @xmath128 , in cesium , in terms of the geometrical parts of the dipole matrix elements , as described by eqs  ( [ eqn : niceg - squared ] ) and ( [ eqn : nicegpgs11 ] ) . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the values for a common arrangement are shown in . while of course linear in any overall scaling of the intensity , the lightshift has a different dependence on the individual field strengths for each of the zeeman sublevels .",
    "it is offset from zero ( for unequal intensities ) and is linear in @xmath89 ; the lightshift between the hyperfine ground states hence has the same dependence on @xmath89 as the zeeman shift , and , in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , is sufficient to account for the majority of the observed spacing between the spectral peaks .",
    "the coupling strengths are not necessarily symmetrical about @xmath129 and , for an experiment in which damping is important , this may be manifest as a change in the amplitude of the peaks",
    ". however , the common arrangement of equal polarizations does not show this asymmetry , and , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , asymmetry in the preparation of the initial states is also important .",
    "we have described the stimulated raman transition and , by including multiple intermediate states from the outset , have obtained results which give the coupling strength for the multistate system and from which the lightshift naturally emerges .",
    "we have applied this method to the cesium atom , given more general expressions for the alkali - metal atoms , and noted how the linear dependence of the lightshift on the @xmath89 level mimics a zeeman shift .",
    "we comment on the possibility of the dependence of the coupling strength on @xmath89 level manifesting as a variation in peak height in experimental spectra .",
    "our results were derived in the limit of far detuning and our calculations were simplified greatly by this enforced absence of decoherence . however , for specific coupling strengths and detunings , the problem of finding eigenvalues and vectors can be treated numerically , and many efficient algorithms exist for this task .",
    "hence , a similar approach might be used for situations including coherent population trapping @xcite and electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite .",
