    "discussion of heavy quarkonium dynamics in this talk is based on results for masses and wave functions obtained in refs.@xcite in a relativistic ( boost - invariant ) hamiltonian formulation of qcd .",
    "steps involved in the calculation , starting with the lagrangian for qcd , deriving the corresponding canonical light - front ( lf ) hamiltonian , carrying out the renormalization group procedure for effective particles ( rgpep ) to obtain the quark and gluon operators at finite momentum scales , @xmath0 , deriving an effective hamiltonian for heavy constituent quarks and gluons , @xmath1 , at momentum scales on the order of the quark mass , @xmath2 , using an ansatz for the mass - gap for gluons , @xmath3 , to finesse a new hamiltonian that acts only in the effective quark - antiquark fock sector , @xmath4 , and solving numerically the resulting eigenvalue problem for @xmath5 , are described in the original literature ( a condensed summary@xcite is available ) .    here , only one example of results for quarkonium masses obtained from @xmath5 is quoted , to illustrate what happens in the simplest version of the lf approach to qcd .",
    "the key point is that the results do not depend on the ansatz @xmath3 and fit data reasonably well for the coupling constant expected from rgpep , assuming it has a known value at @xmath6 , and for the charm or bottom quark masses that have typically considered sizes .",
    "then , the emerging recipe for the mass gap ansatz as a tool to facilitate numerical studies of effective quark and gluon dynamics is described .",
    "the ansatz is designed to be introduced only in the final stage of diagonalizing @xmath5 .",
    "lf quantum field theory has a long history@xcite with lots of modern developments@xcite that can not be duly reviewed here . as part of the progress , a conceptual outline of nonperturbative qcd in the lf frame was achieved@xcite using the similarity renormalization group procedure@xcite .",
    "a confining logarithmic potential of order @xmath7 in quark - antiquark sector has been discovered@xcite and studied in heavy quarkonia@xcite and other systems@xcite , but not using rgpep@xcite .",
    "besides the work that led to refs.@xcite , distinct rgpep applications in scattering theory@xcite and gluonium@xcite are relatively new .",
    "but there is a lot of work to do in lf qcd before it can be widely accepted as a viable alternative to lattice qcd@xcite .",
    "the ads / cft method@xcite has not been connected with rgpep in qcd yet .",
    "in the crudest version , @xmath1 is calculated using rgpep to first order in @xmath8 in one flavor qcd , and @xmath5 is then evaluated to the same order , using the ansatz @xmath3 for gluons in the effective quark - antiquark - gluon sector ( see next section ) . the resulting eigenvalue problem does not depend on the ansatz @xmath3 and takes a form that satisfies requirements of rotational symmetry despite that the lf reference frame distinguishes @xmath9-axis . for example , the eigenstates with quantum numbers of @xmath10 are described by a @xmath11 matrix wave function @xmath12 , where ( @xmath13 is the polarization three - vector that determines the polarization state of the whole quarkonium in motion with arbitrary velocity ) @xmath14 \\ , s^n \\ , .",

    "these lf operators depend on the scale @xmath0 ( in ratio to @xmath22 in the rgpep scheme , and the quark mass ) .",
    "the relative momentum three - vector @xmath23 is defined using lf kinetic momentum variables and the quark mass corresponding to the scale @xmath24 .",
    "the eigenvalue equation satisfied by the @xmath25 and @xmath26 wave functions is written in terms of dimensionless momentum variables @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the strong bohr momentum , @xmath29 ( subscript @xmath24 will be dropped from now on ) .",
    "using @xmath30 , the radial equation can be written as @xmath31 \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } s(p )   \\\\",

    "the functions @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 are given in the literature@xcite .",
    "there is no quantitative trace of the gluon mass ansatz in this result .",
    "but there is a qualitatively new element in the form of a harmonic oscillator correction to the strong coulomb potential ( with lf breit - fermi terms ) .",
    "another qualitatively new element , a result of using rgpep , is the form factor @xmath39 ^ 2 \\right\\ } } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 denotes an invariant mass of a pair of free quarks .",
    "the form factor tempers the spin - dependent gluon exchange interaction .",
    "in particular , it regulates otherwise ultraviolet - divergent three - dimensional delta functions ( in the position space formally associated with the momentum space of @xmath41 via the fourier transform ) , which are present in the functions @xmath42 due to the relativistic spin effects .",
    "one solves the eigenvalue equations for @xmath43 bound states , such as eq.[upsilon ] , assuming that @xmath7 is given by the rgpep evolution from the known value at @xmath6 down to @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath44 , the lowest order rgpep evolution of @xmath45 in qcd with only one flavor@xcite produces @xmath46 at @xmath47 gev ( about 30% smaller value is generated for 6 or 5 flavors ) .",
    "less is known about the rgpep evolution and value of the @xmath48-quark mass , @xmath49 .",
    "tab.[upsilontab ] shows masses of @xmath43 quarkonia obtained@xcite when @xmath7 and @xmath49 are adjusted to reproduce masses of @xmath50(1p ) and @xmath50(2p ) at @xmath51 mev .    0.1 in    .",
    "example of calculated masses ( mev ) for @xmath43 states .",
    "the corresponding coupling constant and quark mass are @xmath7 = 0.32595 and @xmath49 = 4856.92 mev . [ cols=\"<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ upsilontab ]    if the rgpep calculation of @xmath1 and subsequent reduction to @xmath52 were exact , there should be no dependence of the spectrum on @xmath0 .",
    "once @xmath7 and @xmath49 are adjusted to observables at one scale , they evolve in some exact way , including the formation of bound states .",
    "but in this crudely simplified version of lf qcd , the rgpep procedure is limited to order @xmath7 and @xmath52 is finessed using an ansatz for the gluon mass gap @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , one can not change @xmath0 considerably using equations limited to order @xmath7 and there is only a hope that in some small range of values of @xmath24 the equations have a chance to work once the coupling constant and quark mass are given their right relativistic values@xcite .",
    "there is a characteristic pattern visible in the fourth column in tab.[upsilontab ] : the greater the difference between a mass eigenvalue and the masses of quarkonia in the middle of the table , used to choose @xmath7 and @xmath49 , the greater the discrepancy between the crudely approximated theory and experiment .",
    "this should be expected .",
    "the most strongly bound states are sensitive to deviations of the effective potential from the coulomb shape .",
    "for example , interactions order @xmath53 ( or @xmath54 ) , introduce @xmath55-functions that are absent here because of the limitation to terms order @xmath56 in the rgpep and two - quark reduction .",
    "analogous 4th order @xmath55s and other singular corrections are known in qed . here",
    "such terms should have much larger effect because the coupling constant is about 30 times larger then in qed ( they have to be treated nonperturbatively ) .",
    "the least strongly bound states , those with largest masses , should not be described well without proper inclusion of gluons .",
    "the mass ansatz should fail to render interactions that are associated with gluons producing a linear potential at distances much larger than the strong bohr radius .",
    "the mass ansatz for virtual effective particles in fock components that contain more such particles than just two in mesons , or three in baryons , deserves a comment for several reasons .",
    "one reason is that the ansatz may help improve the calculations for heavy quarkonia .",
    "another reason is that it may lead to a possibility of calculating properties of baryons built from heavy quarks .",
    "the third reason is that it may help in crossing the barrier that separates all small - coupling expansions in qcd from entering the region of quark masses much smaller than @xmath22 .",
    "the first two reasons concern the difficulty that precise numerical solutions of eigenvalue problems with coupled two- , three- , and more - particle sectors are hard to obtain . in this respect , the mass ansatz appears a candidate to mimic what happens in an infinite tower of the fock components built from effective particles .",
    "since the rgpep form factors limit momentum transfers by @xmath0 , the spread of probability to sectors with many effective particles corresponding to the scale @xmath0 is tamed .",
    "but these sectors do influence the dynamics of the dominant sectors and some ansatz appears inevitable .",
    "the question is how to make it self - consistently .",
    "the basic idea is to drop all sectors above the highest included ( in the sense of number of the effective particles ) , put in instead a mass ansatz in the highest fock component , and see what happens in the dynamics of lower components .",
    "the next step is to increase the maximal number of effective particles by one and see if the same type of ansatz is producing the same answers .",
    "a small coupling expansion may constrain the options sufficiently for finding good candidates for suitable mass terms in the highest components .    the third reason that concerns light quarks",
    "is most speculative .",
    "it involves chiral symmetry , or rather the mechanism of its breaking . in lf hamiltonian of qcd with small @xmath0 ,",
    "there may exist finite terms that violate chiral symmetry and do not vanish in the limit of quark mass approaching zero@xcite . at the same time",
    ", the lf vacuum state remains simple due to cutoffs imposed on the particle momentum components along the front .",
    "the question is how to find those terms in practice .",
    "lf power counting limits the structure of allowed terms but so far insufficiently for anybody to tackle the issue , even though the stakes are high .    from this point of view , the following observation is of interest . consider a colorless state built from two effective gluons .",
    "they attract each other .",
    "consider then that one of these gluons turns into a pair of quarks .",
    "these quarks are in an octet state and instead of attracting they repel each other .",
    "in perturbation theory , if the number of quark flavors is not too high , this is not dangerous and gluonic interactions sustain asymptotic freedom , generating infrared slavery .",
    "however , beyond perturbation theory , a pointlike creation of a pair of quarks that repel each other by violent potentials may lead to an explosive behavior .",
    "such behavior is entirely absent in qed because electrons attract anti - electrons and this effect slows down the growth of a pair , instead of accelerating it .    to be more specific ,",
    "consider eq.[upsilon ] , in which the @xmath57-wave potential @xmath35 contains a term@xcite that would be a @xmath55-function if the form factor @xmath58 did not smooth it out .",
    "this term is attractive in @xmath10 .",
    "it is repulsive instead in the color octet states .",
    "when @xmath0 is comparable to the heavy quark mass , which means that @xmath7 is small , the smallness of the coupling constant and form factor width produce an interaction that can not compete significantly with the size of the quark mass .",
    "this is visible in tab.[upsilontab ] .",
    "however , if the quarks are light , it is entirely unclear what will happen .",
    "the situation is different than in the case of analogy between a gluonium and a helium atom with one doubly charged electron discussed in ref.@xcite . here",
    ", two particles with the same charge are suddenly put on top of each other and large potential energy is created .    in the case of light quarks ,",
    "the large terms are smoothed out by the rgpep form factors @xmath58 but their strength may be comparable with @xmath22 .",
    "the central point is that in order to find out what happens due the explosive nature of color dynamics of effective particles beyond perturbation theory , one has to separate some sectors from a presumably decreasing but in principle infinite chain of them .",
    "this is what the mass ansatz facilitates .",
    "thus , it opens a way to investigate interactions in the effective hamiltonians that may be calculated perturbatively in rgpep and then diagonalized nonperturbatively using computers .",
    "this way one can find out if the effective interactions may in principle be responsible for emergence of the constituent quark masses for quarks @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath57 .",
    "tab.[upsilontab ] shows that the chance that lf hamiltonian approach to qcd may apply in phenomenology of heavy quarkonia is not hopelessly small .",
    "since the coupling constant one needs is order 1/3 , and one may need even a smaller coupling constant when 4th order rgpep is used , the approach stands ready for a more extended scrutiny .",
    "the reason it deserves to be checked is that it appears now to indicate a possibility that a single formulation of the entire theory with quark masses much greater than @xmath22 is conceivable with no need to combine different formulations for including information concerning different scales .    the harmonic potential finessed in the quark - antiquark sector using an ansatz for the gluon mass gap , leads to the eigenvalues @xmath61 that are proportional to the angular momentum of relative motion of quarks , like in the regge trajectories .",
    "it is found that the oscillator frequencies are on the order of one inverse fermi , and the oscillator potential grows as the relative distance squared in fermis with a coefficient given by the quark mass .",
    "so , presumably , for states with masses greater than order 1 gev above the ground states , the probability of emission of effective gluons increases and then formation of strings of gluons is favored if the gluons also have some oscillator force acting among them . for quantum gluons to form a string , each pair of the neighboring gluons must be held together stronger than by a linear potential .",
    "if it is capable of generating such effects , the lf hamiltonian approach could thus lead to a quantum theory of the gluon string in qcd without ever introducing a nontrivial vacuum .",
    "but the concept of mass ansatz in fock sectors with one more effective particle than the maximal number treated nonperturbatively , is probably most interesting as a tool for finding out what happens when one attempts to solve eigenvalue equations for hamiltonians that are evaluated using perturbative rgpep in the case of canonical qcd with quark masses smaller than @xmath22 .",
    "the idea discussed here is that effective particles in non - singlet color configurations may experience explosive potentials in the form of smoothed @xmath55-functions that may cause effects order @xmath22 per constituent .",
    "the ansatz for quark and gluon masses inserted in the highest sectors thus opens a possibility to generate concrete forms of such terms and to study them nonperturbatively .",
    "nothing is known yet about what may come out from such studies .",
