    "the notion of a valence bond , a simple singlet state formed by two localized spin-1/2 particles , captures much of the physics of how pairs of electrons are correlated in the real world .",
    "this is certainly true when describing chemical bonds in molecules , where a local picture of electron correlations is clearly appropriate ; however , the language of valence bonds has also proven useful for describing a variety of possible singlet ground states of quantum spin systems in the thermodynamic limit , including resonating valence - bond states and valence - bond solids .",
    "valence bonds can also be used for monte carlo simulations , as first shown in the context of variational monte carlo by liang , douot and anderson in 1988 @xcite .",
    "more recently , sandvik @xcite has introduced a projector monte carlo method known as valence - bond monte carlo ( vbmc ) which can be used to efficiently sample ground states of quantum spin systems directly from the valence - bond basis .    in this proceedings",
    "we describe some details of the methods used in our recent work on vbmc simulations of both uniform and random spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains and the closely related 1 + 1 dimensional quantum @xmath0-state potts models @xcite .",
    "one motivation for this work is that for certain values of @xmath0 these models describe interacting chains of non - abelian anyons @xcite , exotic quasiparticle excitations which are thought to arise in certain fractional quantum hall states @xcite .",
    "the results presented here are all for the case of uniform models ( i.e. , with no disorder ) for which a number of exact results are known which can be used to benchmark the method .",
    "we begin by describing the valence - bond basis for a chain of @xmath1 spin-1/2 particles .",
    "this basis is made up of valence - bond states  states in which all @xmath1 particles are paired up to form @xmath2 valence bonds .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) shows two ( normalized ) valence - bond states @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "both these states are examples of _ non - crossing _ valence - bond states , meaning that no two valence - bonds cross each other , or , equivalently , that the total spin of all the particles between any two particles connected by a valence bond must be 0 .    for ordinary spin-1/2 particles",
    "the set of non - crossing valence - bond states forms a complete and _ linearly independent _ basis spanning the space of all total spin 0 states @xcite .",
    "the number of these non - crossing states , and hence the dimensionality of the total spin 0 hilbert space , grows asymptotically as @xmath5 for large @xmath1 , as one would naturally expect for @xmath1 spin-1/2 particles .",
    "one price to be paid for doing numerical calculations with the valence - bond basis is that it is a nonorthogonal basis .",
    "the rule for determining the overlap of any two valence - bond states is shown in fig .  [ fig1](b )  one simply overlays the two valence - bond configurations and counts the number of loops formed , @xmath6 .",
    "the overlap is then @xmath7 , where , for spin-1/2 particles , @xmath8 .     and @xmath9 in which pairs of particles ( solid circles ) are connected by valence bonds ( solid lines ) .",
    "( b ) to determine the overlap of these states one overlays the two valence - bond configurations and counts the number of closed loops , @xmath6 .",
    "the overlap is then @xmath10 where @xmath8 for the case of spin-1/2 particles.,width=245 ]    when @xmath11 the hilbert space spanned by non - crossing valence - bond states is still perfectly well defined provided @xmath12 , although it no longer describes a system of ordinary spin-1/2 particles . for certain values of @xmath13 ,",
    "specifically when @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a positive integer , this hilbert space can be interpreted physically as describing the ` topological charge 0 ' sector of a system of @xmath1 non - abelian anyons described by @xmath16 chern - simons - witten theory @xcite .",
    "for these special values of @xmath13 , the non - crossing valence - bond states are no longer linearly independent and the dimensionality of the hilbert space for @xmath1 particles can be shown to grow asymptotically not as @xmath5 but as @xmath17 .",
    "the quantity @xmath13 is known as the quantum dimension of the particles @xcite .",
    "such @xmath16 anyons are thought to arise physically in certain experimentally observed fractional quantum hall states , notably the state with landau - level filling fraction @xmath18 ( corresponding to @xmath19 ) and , possibly , the @xmath20 state ( corresponding to @xmath21 ) @xcite .",
    "leading to an overall factor of @xmath22 . in the second case ( bottom ) , no loop is formed and the overall factor is @xmath23.,width=245 ]    having defined the relevant hilbert spaces we now turn to the model hamiltonians studied here . to define these models",
    "we first describe the action of a nearest - neighbor singlet projection operator in the valence - bond basis .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the singlet projection operator acting on sites @xmath25 and @xmath26 . figure [ fig2](a ) shows a useful diagrammatic representation of this operator .",
    "figure [ fig2](b ) uses this representation to illustrate the two distinct cases which can occur when acting on a valence - bond state with @xmath24 .",
    "either one applies the projection operator to two sites which are connected by a valence bond , in which case the projection operator has no effect on the state , or one acts on two sites which are each connected to different sites by valence bonds , in which case the projection operator forms a singlet between the two particles it acts on , as well as the two particles connected to them , and gives an overall factor of @xmath27 .",
    "the hamiltonians we consider here all have the form @xmath28 for ordinary spin-1/2 particles with @xmath8 , the singlet projection operator can be expressed as @xmath29 and ( [ model ] ) corresponds to an antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor heisenberg chain . more generally , for arbitrary @xmath13",
    ", one can readily check that the operators @xmath30 satisfy the so - called temperley - lieb algebra @xcite , @xmath31 & = & 0,\\ \\ |i - j| > 1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this algebra appears in the study of the 2-dimensional @xmath0-state potts model with @xmath32 , and as a consequence it can be shown that the models ( [ model ] ) are equivalent to the 1 + 1 dimensional _ quantum _ @xmath0-state potts models @xcite . furthermore , for the special values @xmath33 these models correspond to a sequence of conformally invariant andrews - baxter - forrester @xcite models with central charges @xmath34 @xcite . as stated above , these models",
    "can be thought of as describing chains of interacting non - abelian anyons @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind vbmc is to act on a particular valence - bond state @xmath35 repeatedly with @xmath36 in order to project out the ground state . the results of this projection after @xmath37 iterations can be expressed as follows , @xmath38    since acting on a non - crossing valence - bond state yields another non - crossing valence - bond state , ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) , it follows that @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a non - crossing valence - bond state with the same norm as @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the number of time a projection operator acts on two sites which are not connected by a valence bond in the process of projecting @xmath44 onto the state @xmath3 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows diagrammatic representations for two different terms of the form ( [ term ] ) with @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( in our simulations we study system sizes up to @xmath47 and take @xmath48 ) .",
    "in the end the projection ( [ proj ] ) leads to an expression for the ground state @xmath49 of the form latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    in vbmc one samples the valence - bond states @xmath3 contributing to @xmath49 with probability @xmath51 by updating the sequence of projection operators @xmath52 using the usual metropolis method .",
    "one such monte carlo update is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    given any observable @xmath53 with expectation values @xmath54 in the non - crossing valence - bond states",
    "@xmath3 , vbmc can be used to compute the average @xmath55 for any state @xmath49 of the form ( [ wf ] ) , provided @xmath56 ( which is the case here ) . in what follows",
    ", angle brackets will always denote this average , though it should be noted that @xmath57 will in general not be equal to the true expectation value @xmath58 , both because the valence - bond states are nonorthogonal and because the weight factors @xmath59 are amplitudes and not probabilities .",
    "of course the true quantum expectation value of any operator can be computed by vbmc if one carries out the projection on both the bra state and the ket state @xcite .",
    "however , here we focus on those quantities which can be calculated efficiently using the  one - sided \" vbmc described above .",
    "one quantity which is easily computed using one - sided vbmc is the ground state energy @xmath60 .",
    "the procedure given in @xcite for calculating @xmath60 for spin-1/2 systems can be trivially generalized for arbitrary @xmath13 and leads to the following expression , @xmath61 here , @xmath62 is equal to 1 if sites @xmath25 and @xmath26 are connected by a valence bond and @xmath27 if they are not for a given valence - bond state @xmath3 , and , as described above , the angle brackets denote an average over these valence - bond states weighted by the amplitudes @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , the ground state energies of the models ( [ model ] ) can be found exactly .",
    "this can be seen by noting that for any @xmath13 the temperley - lieb operators can be represented using spin-1/2 operators as @xmath63 @xcite . for the case of open boundary conditions the models ( [ model ] )",
    "can then be mapped onto spin-1/2 xxz chains with external ( non - hermitian ) fields applied to the two ends ( the staggered field term in the expression for @xmath64 cancels in the  bulk \" of the chain ) . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the ground state energies will not depend on boundary conditions , and the values of @xmath60 for the models ( [ model ] ) with periodic boundary conditions should be the same as that for the corresponding @xmath65 models . using the expression for the ground state energies of the @xmath65 models found using bethe ansatz by yang and yang @xcite it is straightforward to obtain the following expression for the ground energies of the models ( [ model ] ) , @xmath66    figure [ fig4 ] shows the ground state energies we obtained by evaluating the expression ( [ energy ] ) by vbmc for @xmath14 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 . the red line is the exact energy ( [ exact ] ) as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "the fact that our numerical results clearly agree with the exact bethe ansatz results should be seen as evidence that vbmc can indeed be used to simulate the models ( [ model ] ) with arbitrary @xmath13 .     as a function of quantum dimension @xmath13 .",
    "the solid red line is the exact bethe ansatz result , and the blue squares are the results of our vbmc simulations ( error bars are smaller than symbol size).,width=245 ]          another quantity which is natural to compute using one - sided vbmc is the so - called valence - bond entanglement entropy @xcite . if @xmath69 is defined to be the total number of bonds leaving a contiguous block of @xmath70 sites in a given valence - bond state @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) then the valence - bond entanglement entropy is defined to be @xmath71 . while this quantity was originally only defined for spin-1/2 systems , the definition clearly generalizes to the models considered here for arbitrary values of @xmath13 , as first noted by jacobsen and saleur @xcite . in this same paper ,",
    "jacobsen and saleur also obtained analytic results for the @xmath72 scaling of @xmath73 . for all @xmath74 they found that @xmath73 scales logarithmically with @xmath70 with a @xmath13 dependent coefficient .",
    "it should be noted that this exact result was based on a mapping to a long - wavelength field theoretic description of the models , and so it is worthwhile testing this prediction numerically .    before describing our results for @xmath73",
    ", we note that this quantity is closely related to the bond - length distribution , @xmath75 , for valence bonds .",
    "this distribution is defined to be @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the number of valence bonds of length @xmath78 in a given valence - bond state @xmath79 .",
    "it is readily shown @xcite that @xmath75 is related to @xmath73 by , @xmath80 ( note that @xmath81 for even @xmath78 . )",
    "this expression , together with the result of @xcite that @xmath73 scales logarithmically with @xmath70 for @xmath74 implies that , for these values of @xmath13 , @xmath75 should follow an inverse - square power law for @xmath82 .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows our vbmc results for @xmath73 and @xmath75 for the cases @xmath83 ( corresponding to the critical one - dimensional transverse field ising model ) and @xmath8 ( corresponding to the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain ) .",
    "the log - log plots of @xmath75 vs. @xmath78 clearly demonstrate the predicted inverse - square power law dependence for the bond - length distribution .",
    "the semi - log plots of @xmath73 also show the expected logarithmic scaling of the valence - bond entanglement entropy , for @xmath72 .",
