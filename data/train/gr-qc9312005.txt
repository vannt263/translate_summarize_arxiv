    "the detection of gravitational waves ( g.w . ) is one of the most fascinating and challenging subjects in physics research nowadays . besides checking the general relativity theory , the detection of this phenomenon will mark the beginning of a new phase in the comprehension of astrophysical phenomena by the use of gravitational wave astronomy .",
    "although these waves were predicted at the beginning of the century @xcite , the research on their detection only started around 1960 , with the studies of joseph weber @xcite .",
    "the major obstacle to this detection is the tiny amplitude the g.w .",
    "have @xcite .",
    "even though the more sensitive detector now operating @xcite is capable to detect amplitudes near @xmath0 , this value must be decreased by several orders of magnitude so that impulsive waves can be detected regularly .    on the other hand ,",
    "the discovery of pulsars with periods lying in the milliseconds range stimulated the investigations on the detection of gravitational waves of periodic origin .",
    "although these waves generally have amplitudes even smaller than those emitted by impulsive sources , periodic sources are continuously emitting gravitational waves in space and they can be detected as soon as the correct sensitivity is reached . since many of the resonant mass antennae now operating are designed to detect frequencies near 1000 hz , the millisecond pulsars will probably be detected if these antennae ever become sensitive to amplitudes @xmath1 .",
    "this value is bigger if we consider the crab pulsar ( @xmath2 ) : @xmath3 .",
    "there is a resonant mass detector with a torsional type antenna ( crab iv ) being developed by the tokyo group @xcite to detect gravitational waves emitted by the crab pulsar .",
    "this group expects to reach @xmath4 soon .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is a contribution towards the increase in sensitivity of resonant mass continuous gravitational wave detectors looking at the use of adequate filters .",
    "we study two kinds of filters , the first optimizes the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , and is normally used in the detection of impulsive waves @xcite .",
    "the second filter reproduces the wave with minimum error .",
    "both filters apparently were not investigated in the continuous gravitational wave context yet .",
    "linear , stationary filters obey the relation    @xmath5 @xmath6 is the impulse response function that characterizes the filter @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the input at the filter and @xmath9 is the filter output .    generally @xmath10 has a useful part , @xmath11 , and an unwanted part , @xmath12 : @xmath13 .",
    "we have a similar relation for the filter output , given by @xmath14 .",
    "it is well known from noise theory@xcite that the filter @xmath15 that optimizes snr at its output represents the average value of @xmath16 .",

    "equation ( [ 2 ] ) is valid as long as @xmath21 is well behaved .",
    "for example , if @xmath11 were a strictly monochromatic wave like    @xmath25    it would be difficult to build this filter since @xmath26 .    in order to use the optimal filter ( [ 2 ] ) in continuous gravitational wave detectors",
