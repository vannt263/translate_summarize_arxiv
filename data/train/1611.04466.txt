    "the primordial inflation explorer ( pixie)@xcite is a space - based polarizing fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) designed to measure the polarization and intensity spectra of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . as for previous fts - based instruments flown to measure the cmb @xcite ,",
    "pixie s design and experimental approach represent a significant departure from the focal plane imagers most commonly used for these measurements .",
    "this is especially true for the detectors . instead of requiring several thousand diffraction - limited , ultra - low - noise detectors",
    ", pixie can achieve nk - scale sensitivity across 2.5 decades in frequency with just four multimode polarization - sensitive bolometers based on silicon thermistors . with a large etendue @xmath1 of @xmath2 @xmath3 sr per detector ,",
    "the detectors are designed for a high optical load ( @xmath4 pw ) , but their noise equivalent power ( nep ) is near the thermodynamic limit and is subdominant to photon noise from the cmb . using high impedance silicon thermistor - based bolometers allows the use of simple and mature junction field effect transistor ( jfet)-based voltage amplifiers . as a nulling experiment , where the signal is a small modulated component in a bright background , the detectors will always operate where assumptions of linearity are strong .",
    "a series of discrete symmetries built into the instrument enable multiple detectors to measure the same signal , allowing measurement and control of detector - sourced systematic effects .",
    "developing detectors for a fts with a large but mechanically robust absorbing area ( @xmath0 times that of planck s spider - web bolometers @xcite ) , large enough bandwidth and appropriate geometry to measure optical frequencies from 15 ghz to 5 thz , and sufficiently low nep ( @xmath5 w@xmath6 ) requires meeting a unique set of design , fabrication , and performance criteria .",
    "we describe these in this paper .",
    "complete descriptions of the pixie instrument are available@xcite , but here we reproduce the highlights that drive bolometer design and performance requirements . a cartoon of the pixie fts is shown in figure [ fig : fts ] .",
    "light is directed into the fts by the primary mirrors , folding flats , and secondary mirrors .",
    "polarizer a defines the instrument s polarization basis , transmitting horizontal ( @xmath7 ) polarization and reflecting vertical ( @xmath8 ) polarization .",
    "polarizer b is oriented at 45@xmath9 relative to polarizer a and mixes the beams .",
    "the moving mirror injects an optical phase delay .",
    "polarizer c has same orientation as polarizer b and sorts the beams .",
    "polarizer d has the same orientation as polarizer a and again splits polarizations .",
    "light is then directed into polarization - maintaining receiver horns@xcite and onto the focal planes .",
    "each focal plane consists of two bolometers mounted back - to - back with their polarization axes orthogonal , allowing a simultaneous measurement of both linear polarization states .",
    "the low frequency cutoff of the instrument ( @xmath10 ghz ) is set by the etendue , and the high frequency cutoff ( @xmath11 thz ) is set by a series of filters and the polarizer grid spacing .",
    "is @xmath12 mm , which corresponds to an optical path difference @xmath13 of @xmath14 mm .",
    "the mirror completes a stroke from @xmath15 mm to @xmath16 mm in 3 seconds . the optical path difference between beams @xmath13",
    "is related to the frequency of incident radiation @xmath17 by the relationship @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the speed of light .",
    "the frequency of the mirror movement @xmath20 is related to the frequency of incident radiation by @xmath21 . where @xmath22 is the moving mirror s velocity .",
    "the cmb signal is largely confined to acoustic frequencies below 15 hz .",
    "the dust signal is confined to acoustic frequencies below 100 hz .",
    "these constraints drive the bolometer bias and bandwidth requirements .",
    "right : simulated time domain signal ( interferogram ) incident on a pixie bolometer .",
    "this shows the fourier transform of the polarized cmb.,scaledwidth=33.0% ]    light incident on the instrument is represented by @xmath23 .",
    "if both beams are open to the sky , the power measured by the detectors is    @xmath24    where the superscripts @xmath25 and @xmath26 indicate whether the detector is on the left of right side of the fts ( see figure [ fig : fts ] ) , the subscripts @xmath27 and @xmath28 indicate whether the detector is measuring @xmath7 or @xmath8 polarization , @xmath17 is the frequency of incident radiation , @xmath29 is the mirror position , and @xmath19 is the speed of light .",
    "each power expression given in equation [ eq : p ] consists of a dc term and a term modulated by the movement of the mirror .",
    "the former represents the total intensity of incident light , and the latter is the fourier transform of the difference spectrum between orthogonal incident polarizations ( stokes @xmath30 in instrument - fixed coordinates ) . given the small linearly polarized fraction of the microwave sky , the signal measured by the detectors thus consists of a small modulated component on top of near - constant optical bias . taking the inverse fourier transform of the measured signals removes the dc component and we are left with the spectra of polarized light measured by each detector :    @xmath31    where the subscript @xmath17 indicates that we are working in the frequency domain .",

    "the bolometer consists of an optical absorber structure coupled to silicon thermistor - based thermometers that operate at @xmath35 mk under optical and electrical bias .",
    "the thermometers are coupled to the chip frame held at the bath temperature ( @xmath36 mk ) .",
    "the absorber structure ( section [ sec : abs ] ) is a large - area ( 1.61 @xmath3 ) grid of freestanding , micromachined , degenerately doped silicon wires .",
    "the thermistors are located on silicon membranes ( `` endbanks '' , section [ sec : eb ] ) at either end of the absorber structure .",
    "each endbank consists of a gold bar for thermalization and two thermistors that are independently biased and read out for laboratory characterization but will be wired in series or parallel in flight .",
    "the endbanks are coupled to the chip frame ( section [ sec : frame ] ) through a series of silicon legs . on the chip frame",
    "are wirebond pads for bias and readout of the thermistors and an array of indium bumps enabling the hybridization of a pair of bolometer chips .",

    "they are 3 @xmath34 m wide , 1.35 @xmath34 m thick , 15.8 mm long , and are on a 30 @xmath34 m pitch , making them effective absorbers for frequencies up to @xmath11 thz .",
    "the wires are degenerately doped with phosphorous to be metallic at all temperatures .",
    "the absorber structure s effective sheet resistance is designed to be 377 @xmath39 , impedance matching it to free space .",
    "the string width and thickness are highly uniform across the array .",
    "the thickness is set by the device layer thickness on the starting silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) substrate , and they are etched to width with an inductively - coupled plasma ( icp ) reactive ion etch ( rie ) process .    in previous generations of devices",
    ", we found that the doping process induced compressive stress in absorber strings along the axis of absorption , causing individual strings to buckle and protrude @xmath40 @xmath34 m from the chip frame .",
    "this is problematic for a hybridized pair of chips which are separated by @xmath33 @xmath34 m , since absorbers could collide and break , particularly during vibrations at launch . to prevent this , and to raise the resonant frequencies of the strings to well above the frequencies they will experience at launch",
    ", we deposited a highly - tensile al@xmath41o@xmath42 film on individual strings outside the active absorbing area .",
    "this feature effectively pulls the strings taught ( see figure [ fig : abs ] ) , and based on our elastic model should keep the amplitude of any string vibrations to less than @xmath43 @xmath34 m rms over the band of excitation frequencies expected during launch ( 20 hz - 10 khz ) .",
    "we also estimated the bolometer sensitivity to cosmic ray hits . to minimize the impact of cosmic ray hits , the time constant of the absorber structure",
    "should be much shorter than the hit rate .",
    "based on planck s measured hit rate @xcite , and scaling for our geometry , we expect one cosmic ray hit every two seconds .",
    "measurements and thermal models of our absorber structure yield a time constant of a few ms , so particle hits can easily be flagged and removed during data processing without corrupting an entire interferogram .",
    "each bolometer chip has two endbanks , one at each end of the absorber structure ( figure [ fig : abs ] ) .",
    "the endbanks consist of a gold bar for thermalization and two doped silicon thermistors on a crystalline silicon membrane .",
    "the gold bar also sets the heat capacity of the endbank .",
    "the endbank membrane is the same thickness ( 1.35 @xmath34 m ) as the absorber strings , and is also formed from the device layer of the soi substrate .",
    "endbanks are connected to the chip frame through eight silicon legs .",
    "the thermistors are doped to operate below their metal - insulator transition .",
    "the electron transport mechanism in this regime is variable range hopping ( vrh)@xcite , which yields the following resistance - temperature relationship :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are constants determined largely by the device geometry and doping concentration , respectively .",
    "we also developed a detailed thermal model of the endbank that takes into account heat flow between each thermal element ( absorber strings , gold bar , thermistor and legs ) . this will be discussed in greater detail in section [ sec : perf ] .",
    "the bolometer frame is maintained at the refrigerator bath temperature . under normal operation , the bath will be kept at @xmath36 mk .",

    "the thermistor is wired in series with a bias resistor .",
    "the bias resistor s resistance is much greater than the thermistor s operating resistance , so the thermistor is under current bias . tensioned leads connect the bolometer to a cryogenic jfet amplifier , mitigating capacitive microphonic contamination of the signal band .",
    "for pixie , we use interfet nj14al16 jfets@xcite that operate at @xmath48 k in a source - follower configuration .",
    "these are the same model jfets that were flown as part of the xrs instrument on astro - e2/suzaku@xcite and the sxs instrument on astro - h / hitomi@xcite .",

    "given the endbank geometry , we solve for the etendue between each thermal component , then determine the heat flow between each of them .",
    "heat flow between components on the endbank is via ballistic phonon conduction , where the phonon mean free path @xmath73 is much greater than the endbank dimensions .",

    "when pixie observes the cmb the bolometers will operate under high optical bias ( @xmath4 pw ) .",
    "this results in a large temperature difference between the thermistors and the bath .",

    "the factor of @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the bolometer s electrical responsivity , refers the johnson , amplifier , and excess noise to the bolometer s input . multiplying the nep@xmath84 by @xmath85 gives the voltage power spectral density of the bolometer .    with relevant parameters taken from load curve analysis ( section [ sec : loadcurves ] ) , and accounting for non - equilibrium effects , we calculated the expected bolometer noise under a few bias conditions , and compared them to measured noise spectra . an example noise spectrum and fit",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : se_noise ] .",
    "fits are consistently good for multiple measured bias conditions . running the model for the bias conditions expected during flight",
    ", we expect to be photon noise limited across the entire pixie bandwidth ( figure [ fig : nep ] ) .",
    "we designed , fabricated , and characterized large area polarization - sensitive bolometers for the pixie experiment .",
    "multimode bolometers designed for a fts like pixie require a different optimization from bolometers developed for focal - plane imagers .",
    "in particular , they must handle a large , near - constant optical bias ( @xmath4 pw ) , but still operate with sensitivity near the thermodynamic limit across the relevant bandwidth .",
    "they also must have a large and mechanically robust absorbing area that is sensitive to all optical frequencies of interest , but relatively insensitive to particle hits .",
    "mechanical characterization of the fabricated pixie bolometers with scanning electron microscopy and white light interferometry shows that our tensioning scheme successfully flattens the absorber strings , enabling indium bump hybridization of a pair of bolometer chips .",
    "the resonant frequencies of the tensioned absorbers are also expected to be well above the vibrational frequencies the detectors will experience at launch .",
    "we will confirm this in the near future by subjecting a hybridized pair of bolometers to environmental testing .",
    "the dark data provide significant insight into the performance of the pixie bolometers , particularly regarding the thermal behavior of the endbanks .",
    "our thermal model agress well with the data , and the results indicate that the pixie bolometers satisfy the sensitivity and bandwidth requirements of the space mission ( see figure [ fig : nep ] ) . in the immediate future",
    ", we will further characterize the bolometers , specifically targeting the absorber structure .",
    "these measurements will include thermal transport measurements of absorbers in the dark , ac impedance measurements , and optical measurements with a cryogenic blackbody source .",
