    "the interplay of spin , charge and lattice degrees of freedom has been investigated intensively in many transition metal oxides and especially in perovskite manganites , which have recently attracted new interest due to the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) .",
    "the initial understanding of the properties of manganites was based on the double - exchange mechanism within a kondo lattice.@xcite however , neutron scattering @xcite and electron diffraction @xcite experiments have revealed the simultaneous presence of charge and spin superstructures which makes these early theoretical approaches incomplete .    the existence of charge , lattice and spin modulations with a doping - dependent wave vector in la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath2 , @xcite or the presence of charge ordering at half filling in nd@xmath3sr@xmath3mno@xmath4 @xcite and similar compounds , such as pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath4 , @xcite all suggest that the theoretical understanding has to be extended to account for effects stemming from the lattice in order to understand the doping dependent phase diagram and the richness of phases that are obtained .",
    "more recently , in electron doped charge ordered manganites la@xmath5ca@xmath1mno@xmath4 charge , orbital , and magnetic ordering has been observed @xcite for the first time .",
    "several experiments also confirmed this behavior in other compounds.@xcite charge ordering has also been found for other doping systems as in bi@xmath5ca@xmath1mno@xmath4 @xcite and in la@xmath5ca@xmath1mno@xmath4 ( doped with @xmath6 ) @xcite for @xmath7 .    because of these complex behaviors ,",
    "manganese oxides have been intensively studied during the last few years . since realistic models of these perovskites",
    "is impossible to solve completely , different approximation schemes have been introduced to account for the individual properties of their rich phase diagram .",
    "typically , the electronic degrees of freedom are described by a kondo lattice model ( klm ) which in the strong hund coupling limit reduces to the zener @xcite double - exchange hamiltonian .",
    "early theories @xcite proposed to explain the physics of cmr materials have focused primarily on this model .",
    "as the previously noted experimental findings show , all the approaches based entirely on the phenomenon of double - exchange are incomplete @xcite .",
    "understanding the complex phase diagram of the perovskites can be resolved by including additional physics in the kondo lattice , in the form of electron - phonon coupling @xcite originating from a jahn - teller splitting of the mn@xmath8 ion .",
    "consequently , our first goal here is to understand the lattice effects in the klm by including explicitly the interaction with the lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "a further consequence of the strong hund coupling is that three localized @xmath9 orbitals of the mn@xmath10 ions will be aligned , giving rise to a @xmath11 localized spin .",
    "as most of the recent approaches to cmr are based on monte carlo simulations of one dimensional models,@xcite it has been argued that for finite temperatures a classical spin represents a reasonable approximation .",
    "however , this may not be the best approach , as the quantum fluctuations are the strongest in one dimension .",
    "hence , our second goal here is to develop a bosonization approach which solves the full quantum spin klm in one dimension . for completeness",
    "we will allow for both ferro- and antiferromagnetic coupling in the klm .",
    "in cmr materials where the coupling is ferromagnetic , it is obvious that double - exchange dominates .",
    "we will show in section ii that this is also the case for antiferromagnetic coupling , as in , e.g. , heavy fermion compounds @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows , in section ii we investigate the presence of double - exchange ferromagnetism in both @xmath12 and @xmath13 cases .",
    "section iii contains a description of our starting hamiltonian .",
    "section iv contains the details of the bosonized solution .",
    "section v is devoted to a comprehensive description of the localized spin ordering . in section",
    "vi the obtained phase diagram is analysed in detail .",
    "section vii contains the conclusions .",
    "in order to gain a more transparent understanding of the double - exchange interaction we investigate first the case of two sites and one conduction electron , as was done originally by anderson and hasegawa , and de gennes.@xcite in the case of ferromagnetic coupling ( @xmath12 ) the ground state energy is @xmath14 with wave function @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 refers to the @xmath18 component of the impurity and conduction electron spins , respectively .",
    "as can be seen , ferromagnetism arises here via an ising type coupling , which allows for description of the ground state within a simple semiclassical approximation.@xcite    for @xmath13 the situation is completely changed due to the singlet formation of localized and conduction electron spins . due to this kondo singlet formation",
    ", which is absent for the @xmath12 case , double - exchange is often ignored in the discussions of the @xmath13 klm .",
    "this case has usually been discussed in terms of the competition between kondo singlet formation and the rkky interaction . for a half filled band",
    ", this point of view appears to be sufficient .",
    "however for a partially filled conduction band an overwhelming amount of numerical data @xcite proves that ferromagnetism appears for stronger coupling .",
    "this can not be explained in terms of rkky , which operates at weak - coupling , nor in terms of kondo singlets , since they are non - magnetic .",
    "the missing element is double - exchange ordering @xcite due to an excess of localized spins over conduction electrons .",
    "double - exchange requires only that the number of conduction electrons is less than the number of localized spins .",
    "it operates in any dimension , for any sign of the coupling @xmath19 , and for any magnitude @xmath20 of the localized spins.@xcite .",
    "the double - exchange interaction is specific to the kondo lattice , and is absent in single- or dilute - impurity systems in which the situation is reversed , and the electrons greatly outnumber the localized spins .",
    "double - exchange is conceptually a very simple interaction : each electron has on average more than one localized spin to screen , and consequently hops between several adjacent spins gaining screening energy at each site , together with a gain in kinetic energy . since hopping is energetically most favourable for electrons which preserve their spin as they hop ( called coherent hopping )",
    ", this tends to align the underlying localized spins.@xcite .    for two sites ,",
    "this causes a mixing of the total spin and an enhancement of the hilbert space , where now 16 elements have to be considered .",

    "@xmath25 involves six basis elements ( the degeneracy is partially lifted by conduction electron hopping ) and hence falls outside the four dimensional space needed to establish double - exchange for @xmath12 .    in order to invoke double - exchange as well ,",
    "all three spin directions , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath18 , have to be considered : @xmath28 \\ : \\vert \\psi_{\\rm ks } \\rangle_{z }   + [ 1 / ( j/4 - e_{0 , \\ : j > 0 } ) ] \\ :   \\ { \\vert \\psi_{\\rm de } \\rangle_{j > 0 , \\ : x }   + \\vert \\psi_{\\rm de } \\rangle_{j > 0 , \\ : y } + \\vert \\psi_{\\rm de } \\rangle_{j > 0 , \\ : z } \\}$ ] , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in spite of this extra complication",
    ", it is apparent from the above that also for @xmath13 , ferromagnetism appears .",
    "we show in section v that coherent conduction electron hopping over a characteristic length @xmath31 may be incorporated into a bosonization description which keeps the electrons finitely delocalized . at lengths beyond @xmath31 ,",
    "the electrons are described by collective density fluctuations , common to one dimensional fermi systems .",
    "the electrons remain finitely delocalized over shorter lengths , and describe coherent hopping over several adjacent sites .",
    "this tends to align the underlying localized spins at stronger coupling .",
    "@xmath31 measures the effective range of the double - exchange interaction , and hence is proportional to the width of the magnetic polarons .",
    "the klm considers the coupling between a half - filled narrow band ( localized @xmath32 or @xmath33 ) and conduction electrons . even though studied intensively for the last two decades , the understanding of the klm remains incomplete . only in one dimension",
    "have numerical simulations @xcite and bosonization techniques @xcite been carried through to admit predictions about the phase diagram of the klm .",
    "no investigations exist for the case where the klm is extended to account for contributions stemming from the phonons , which is of special relevance to cmr materials .",
    "in particular , the small doping regime of these systems , which are ferromagnetic at low temperatures , seems to be appropriate for modelling within the klm argumented by interactions with the lattice . in the following we present bosonized solutions of the klm where on - site coulomb and specific phonon contributions are explicitly included .",
    "this `` extended '' klm model allows spin - and magnetoelastic - polaron formation , which we believe are of major importance in understanding these complex materials .",
    "the hamiltonian of the klm in the presence of on - site coulomb interaction reads : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the conduction electron hopping integral , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the pauli spin matrices .",
    "fermi operators @xmath39 with subscript @xmath32 refer to localized @xmath32-spins , while those not indexed refer to the conduction electrons .",
    "the on - site coulomb repulsion is given by the hubbard term proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "in the cmr materials the localized states are represented by the threefold degenerate mn @xmath41 @xmath32-electrons with total spin 3/2 .",
    "however , for reasons of transparency , the localized spin is approximated here by spin 1/2 .",
    "the properties of the model are qualitatively independent of the magnitude of the localized spins , i.e. , the basic features of the phase diagram for the three dimensional case appear in one dimensions as well @xcite .    in the following the kondo coupling @xmath19",
    "is measured in units of the hopping @xmath42 and both cases , antiferromagnetic ( @xmath13 ) and ferromagnetic ( @xmath12 ) couplings , will be considered .",
    "the conduction band filling is given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the number of lattice sites and @xmath45 is the number of conduction electrons . in order to understand the broad properties of cmr materials , we also allow for the number of impurity spins , @xmath46 , to vary , in such a way that @xmath47 . in this way , doped or dilute kondo lattice systems can also be studied .",
    "it will be shown that a dilute kondo lattice system is dominated by short range antiferromagnetic correlations .    in one dimension ,",
    "the electron - phonon coupling can either be of inter - site ( su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) @xcite ) or on - site ( holstein @xcite ) character .",
    "the models we study assumes a dispersionless phonon mode with frequency @xmath48 .",
    "the neglect of the dispersion of bare phonons is not essential since it is absent in the holstein model and the acoustic phonons are decoupled from the low energy electronic spectrum in the continuum limit of the ssh model.@xcite in this approximation the holstein coupling to dispersionless phonons has the following form : @xmath49 with the conduction electron density @xmath50 at site @xmath51 , the lattice displacement @xmath52 , its conjugate momentum @xmath53 , the electron - phonon coupling strength @xmath54 , the spring constant @xmath55 and the ionic mass @xmath56 . within the ssh model the coupling to phonons",
    "is modified to @xmath57 \\ ; ,   \\label{ph - ot}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 denotes the electron - phonon coupling strength .",
    "thus , the starting hamiltonian is @xmath59    these phononic contributions may not describe the full complexity of the phononic couplings observed in real materials because of the phase space constraint of any one dimensional calculation .",
    "however , the results capture the essence of the kondo lattice coexisting with phonons , and being an exact solution , it represents a vital source of information due to the lack of comparable solutions applicable to colossal magnetoresistance materials .",
    "a large class of one dimensional many - electron systems may be described using bosonization techniques @xcite : the electron fields may be represented in terms of collective density operators which satisfy bosonic commutation relations .",
    "bosonic representations provide a non - perturbative description which , in general , by far easier to evaluate than a formulation in terms of fermionic operators .",

    "the charge and spin velocities are @xmath94 where the fermi velocity is @xmath95 in units of @xmath42 .",
    "it is important to note that a renormalization of the spinon - holon velocities appears here due to the hubbard and phonon terms which act oppositely on the corresponding velocities .",
    "while the hubbard term leads to a localization of the spinons and an increased hopping of the holons , thus supporting a magnetic ground state , the phonons delocalize the spins , but localize the charges and act destructively on the magnetic properties .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the hubbard term alone already suffices to establish two time scales for the holon - spinon dynamics .",
    "but an important renormalization of the critical properties of the system is achieved through the variable phonon coupling , which , as will be shown below , establishes the existence of a griffiths phase .",
    "the competition between the hubbard and the phonon term obviously vanishes for @xmath96 .    in the following ,",

    "the localized spin @xmath32 impurities act via double - exchange on the hopping electrons so as to preserve their spin when moving through the lattice in order to screen the localized spins which are in excess of the conduction electrons , i.e. @xmath97 .",
    "this , in turn , leads to a tendency to align the localized spins and results in an additional screening energy for the conduction electrons .",
    "in order to determine rigorously the phase diagram and investigate the ordering of the local spins due to the formation of polarons , we firstly apply a unitary transformation .",
    "this is the simplest method for determining the ordering of the localized spins induced by the conduction electrons and it has been used successfully elsewhere @xcite .",

    "( [ velocities ] ) , this is due to the fact that the hubbard term leads to a localization of spinons and an increase in the hopping of holons , hence increasing the double - exchange . on the other hand , the electron - phonon interaction counteracts this effect by localizing the holons and thus decreasing @xmath107 .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] also shows that the length @xmath31 characterizes the effective range of the double - exchange interaction .",
    "this interaction originates from the bosonization of the conduction electron band in the following way : at wavelengths larger than @xmath31 , the electrons combine to form collective density fluctuations , which involve large numbers of electrons satisfying bosonic commutation relations .",
    "this is the standard behavior of one dimensional many - electron systems for weak interactions @xcite . at wavelengths smaller than @xmath31 , the density fluctuations are not collective , and loose the bosonic character .",

    "one spin - flip process is backscattering , and is accompanied by a momentum transfer of @xmath134 from the conduction electrons to the localized spins . since the chain of localized spins will tend to order so as to reflect this transfer , the transverse - field corresponding to backscattering spin - flips is sinusoidally modulated by @xmath134 .",
    "the other low - energy spin - flip process in @xmath132 is forward scattering .",
    "this involves zero momentum transfer to the localized spins , and the corresponding transverse - field is a constant ( i.e.   has modulation zero ) .",

    "thus the phonons indeed will enhance charge localization and increase the polaronic effect and act destructively on the spin ordering . in the presence of phonons , these magnetoelastic polarons will dominate a larger phase space below and above the ferromagnetic transition compared to the standard klm .",

    "thus most of the properties presented previously will survive in higher dimensions .",
    "this have been confirmed also by extensive numerical calculations.@xcite an important prediction of our theory is the finite temperature behavior of the polaronic liquid phase below the transition line , the so - called weakly disordered paramagnetic phase .",
    "this is the region of the phase diagram which is enhanced by phonons and as such dominated by magnetoelastic polarons , as explained previously . here , following closely ref .",

    "@xmath174 is a temperature scale at which the renormalization flow is stopped when the temperature fluctuation scale equals the quantum fluctuation    the susceptibility diverges at @xmath175 in the griffiths phase as expected @xcite .",
    "if @xmath148 increases , e.g. , @xmath176 the system moves away from criticality , the susceptibility at zero temperature will be finite and will no longer be dominated by the large rare polarons but rather by the more typical smaller ones , becoming a strongly disordered phase . on the temperature scale",
    ", this corresponds to increasing the temperature .",
    "thus , at higher temperatures the susceptibility will become @xmath177 .",
    "interestingly , this is identical to the phenomenological form of the susceptibility that has been associated with heavy quasiparticles in all heavy fermion compounds.@xcite for these compounds @xmath174 is the temperature at which the heavy quasiparticle liquid start to emerge from a standard kondo lattice behavior .",
    "note that in our approach of deriving @xmath178 we moved away from the critical point , in agreement with recent calculations @xcite that the heavy fermion systems are in the vicinity off , but not on a griffiths singularity .",
    "in summary , we have derived an effective hamiltonian from a one - dimensional kondo lattice model extended to include effects stemming from coupling to the lattice and in the presence of an onsite hubbard term , which accounts for the conduction electron coulomb repulsion .",
    "the results are : i ) a ferromagnetic phase appears at intermediate @xmath179 due to forward scattering by delocalized conduction electrons .",
    "ii ) ferromagnetism is favoured by the hubbard term , while it is suppressed by the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "iii ) the paramagnetic phase is characterized by the coexistence of polaronic regimes with intrinsic ferromagnetic order and ordinary conduction electrons .",
    "iv ) in the paramagnetic phase , two time scales compete with each other - reminiscent of a two - fluid model - and the variability of the critical exponents suggests the existence of a griffiths phase .",
    "the results are related to the small - doping regime of cmr materials which are ferromagnets at low temperatures , since here the coupling to the phonons has been shown to dominate the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase transition . note that moving away from this criticality into the weakly disordered polaronic liquid phase the results , in particular the finite temperature susceptibility , show behavior characteristic to all heavy fermion compounds.@xcite    in regard to the cmr materials , it is interesting to point out the discrepancy between infinite dimensional calculations and the present one dimensional results .",
    "many approximate calculations to model cmr @xcite have been made in dynamical mean - field theory , which is an infinite dimensional approximation and therefore incapable of capturing spatial inhomogeneities . in the present work",
    "we have approached the cmr materials via a one dimensional approximation , but with techniques able to describe fluctuations of short - range order .",
    "our results show that strong intrinsic spatial inhomogeneities of griffiths type dominate the behaviour of the kondo lattice .",
    "consequently the inhomogeneities exhibit clear statistical scaling properties as a function of the proximity to a quantum ( order - disorder ) critical point .",
    "the phonons enhance the inhomogeneities , which , in a good approximation behave as a supercritical ( metastable ) phase of a two fluid model .    even though various bosonization schemes have been used for the one - dimensional klm,@xcite non of the previous approaches took into account phonons .",
    "the inclusion of phonon degrees of freedom has been shown here to be relevant in creating local magnetic inhomogeneities .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the properties of the system are controlled by intrinsic inhomogeneities .",
    "this means that , in a renormalization group approach , the dimensionality should not matter.@xcite thus , a similar behaviour is expected in realistic two- and three - dimensions , which clearly merit further detailed study .",
