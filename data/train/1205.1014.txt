    "we list the sequence of coefficients , starting with the constant term , for the first few @xmath319 here : @xmath322    [ unimodality ] for @xmath323 , @xmath319 is a unimodal polynomial .",

    "it is natural to ask if @xmath319 has this stronger property of log - concavity .",

    "for example in @xmath327 we have @xmath328 , and @xmath329 .",
    "since @xmath330 for all permutations @xmath6 , we see that @xmath331 is the set of all @xmath1-bubble sortable permutations in @xmath2 ( i.e. @xmath332 for all @xmath333 ) . in @xcite",
    ", the authors also show that there is a bijective correspondence between @xmath331 , and certain juggling sequences of period @xmath140 . in this section , we show that there is bijection between @xmath334 and a natural 2-colored analog of the aforementioned juggling sequences .",
    "formally , an @xmath140-periodic juggling sequence , @xmath335 , is a sequence of @xmath140 nonnegative integers such that the values @xmath336 are all distinct .",
    "one can interpret each @xmath337 as corresponding to a ball being thrown at time @xmath67 which remains in the air for @xmath337 time units .",
    "if @xmath338 , then no ball is thrown at time @xmath67 .",
    "we also think of the pattern defined by @xmath339 as being repeated indefinitely , so that the juggling sequence is an infinite sequence of period @xmath140 .",
    "the condition that the values @xmath336 are distinct guarantees that no two balls will land at the same time .",
    "furthermore , the average of the @xmath337 s , which is an integer , is the number of balls being juggled ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "next we define the state of a juggling sequence ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "suppose the juggler , who has been repeating the @xmath140-periodic juggling pattern @xmath339 infinitely many times in the past , stops juggling after the ball corresponding to @xmath340 is thrown .",
    "the balls that are in the air will land at various times , and we record the landing schedule as a binary sequence @xmath341 . if @xmath342 , then a ball landed @xmath67 time units after the last ball was thrown . if @xmath343 , then no ball landed at that time .",
    "so @xmath342 if and only if there is some @xmath344 and some @xmath345 such that @xmath346 .",
    "since the tail of the sequence @xmath161 must be all zeros , we let @xmath161 be a finite sequence where the last entry is the last 1 appearing in @xmath161 .",
    "the state of a juggling sequence is the sequence @xmath161 determined by the landing schedule .",
    "there is a particular state which is called the ground state .",
    "if @xmath339 is an @xmath140-periodic juggling sequence with @xmath1 balls being juggled , we say that @xmath339 has the ground state if its state is @xmath347 .    [ ajuggling ] there is a bijection , @xmath348 , between permutations in @xmath331 and juggling sequences which are @xmath140-periodic , juggle @xmath1 balls , and have the ground state .",
    "given @xmath333 , this map is defined by @xmath349    [ bjuggling def ] we now define 2-colored ( or signed ) juggling sequences .",
    "suppose the juggler may initially select @xmath1 balls to juggle , and there are two colors to choose from for each ball .",
    "we encode this as a signed juggling sequence @xmath335 where each @xmath337 is now an integer .",
    "the sign of @xmath337 is the color of the ball being thrown at @xmath337 , and it remains in the air for @xmath350 time units .",
    "we still do not allow more than one ball to land at the same time , so we require that the values @xmath351 are all distinct . furthermore , we do not allow the juggler to change colors once the juggling has started .",
    "therefore , if @xmath339 has period @xmath140 , we also require that @xmath352 we will also define @xmath353 . thus @xmath354 is a ( 1-colored ) juggling sequence as described above .",
    "we define the state of a 2-colored juggling sequence @xmath339 to be the state of @xmath354 , and we say @xmath339 juggles @xmath1 balls if @xmath354 juggles @xmath1 balls .    now consider the special case when @xmath335 is a 2-colored ( or 1-colored ) juggling sequence , where @xmath339 has the ground state , juggles @xmath1 balls , and @xmath355 .",
    "the fact that @xmath339 has the ground state implies that @xmath356 are all nonzero .",
    "informally , we define the landing permutation of @xmath339 , which we will denote by @xmath357 , to be the order in which the first @xmath1 balls thrown will land if we stop juggling at time @xmath140 .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath358 we define the landing time of @xmath67 , denoted @xmath359 , recursively by @xmath360 then @xmath361    for example , consider the 1-colored juggling sequence @xmath362 , which juggles 3 balls , has period 7 , and has the ground state .",
    "we can visualize @xmath339 with the following diagram :    @xmath363{juggling1.eps}\\ ] ]    the landing permutation associated to @xmath339 is @xmath364 .",

    "let @xmath367 be the set of 2-colored juggling sequences , where @xmath368 if @xmath339 is @xmath369-periodic , juggles @xmath1 balls , has the ground state , and @xmath354 is @xmath140-periodic .",
    "there is a bijection @xmath370 .",
    "first we describe @xmath371 , so let @xmath230 .",
    "recall that @xmath372 . moreover , we have @xmath373 since all drop sizes decrease or stay the same if we remove the signs .",
    "define a 1-colored juggling sequence @xmath374 using the map @xmath348 from theorem [ ajuggling ] : @xmath375 where @xmath244 denotes concatenation .",
    "note that theorem [ ajuggling ] guarantees that @xmath233 is a juggling sequence which juggles @xmath1 balls and has the ground state .",
    "we construct @xmath376 by assigning signs to each @xmath377 for @xmath378 , so @xmath379 .",
    "first we set @xmath380 we then assign signs recursively by @xmath381    since @xmath379 , it is clear ( using theorem [ ajuggling ] ) that @xmath368 if we can show that @xmath339 satisfies . since @xmath339 has the ground state , a ball thrown at time @xmath67 where @xmath382 , lands no sooner than time @xmath383 , thus is well defined . since no two balls land at the same ,",
    "the assignments from are also well defined . also , the fact that @xmath339 has the ground state guarantees that each nonzero @xmath377 is assigned a sign .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath384 again , the fact that @xmath339 has the ground state ensures that @xmath385 , therefore will be satisfied if we can show that the landing permutation associated to @xmath339 is the identity permutation .",
    "indeed , let @xmath386 be the landing permutation associated to @xmath387 , and let @xmath388 be the landing permutation associated to @xmath339 .",
