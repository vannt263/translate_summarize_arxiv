    "the discovery of a narrow resonance @xmath5 has an important impact on the studies of exotic hadrons @xcite .",
    "this resonance is peaked at @xmath8 gev with a decay width narrower than @xmath9 mev .",
    "it is confirmed to have baryon number @xmath10 , charge @xmath11 and strangeness @xmath12 .",
    "the quantum number itself implies that the @xmath13 has to contain at least one @xmath14 .",
    "hence , its simplest configuration is @xmath15 , i.e. , a manifestly exotic penta - quark ( 5q ) .",
    "the experimental discovery was motivated by a theoretical prediction @xcite .    since its discovery",
    ", there have been an enormous number of theoretical contributions @xcite .",
    "the determination of its parity is an important topic .",
    "experimental determination of parity of the @xmath13 is difficult , and the opinions are divided into two pieces in the theoretical side .",
    "there are several lattice qcd studies of 5q available @xcite , which , however , have not yet reached a consensus .",
    "refs.@xcite claim the existence of a bound negative - parity 5q state , whereas ref.@xcite claims that the lowest - lying 5q bound state has positive - parity .",
    "( note that , below this positive - parity state , they actually obtained a negative - parity state , which they claim to be a scattering state . )",
    "refs.@xcite have observed no evidence for narrow 5q resonances on lattice .",
    "ref.@xcite studies the static 5q potential to provide physical insights into effective models . under these circumstances ,",
    "our aim is to provide an accurate lattice qcd result using anisotropic lattice technique .",
    "furthermore , we propose a new method with `` _ hybrid boundary condition ( hbc ) _ '' , which can raise the s - wave @xmath0 threshold artificially .",
    "hbc is expected to serve as a convenient tool in the studies of negative - parity 5q states .",
    "we employ the standard wilson gauge action at @xmath16 ( @xmath17 gev ) on @xmath18 lattice with the renormalized anisotropy @xmath19 to generate 504 gauge field configurations .",
    "the anisotropic lattice technique is known to serve as a powerful tool for high - precision measurements @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath20-improved wilson quark ( clover ) action @xcite adopting four values of hopping parameter @xmath21 , which cover the quark mass region as @xmath22 . by keeping @xmath23 fixed for @xmath24 quark , we change @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 quarks for chiral extrapolation .",
    "we adopt the spatially extended source to enhance the low - lying spectrum . assuming that the quantum number of the @xmath28 is spin @xmath29 and isospin @xmath2",
    ", we employ a _",
    "non-@xmath0 type interpolating field _ @xcite @xmath30 to construct two - point 5q correlators . here ,",
    "@xmath31 denote color indices , and @xmath32 denotes the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "the dirac bispinor field @xmath33 couples to baryon states of both parities .",
    "since @xmath33 transforms as @xmath34 under the spatial reflection , the projection matrix @xmath35 can be used to project the intermediate states into positive and negative parities , respectively , in the `` forward - propagation '' region @xmath36 .    in both the parity channels , the effective - mass plots have plateaus , where the single - exponential fit analysis is performed . in the positive - parity channel ,",
    "we obtain @xmath37 gev after the chiral extrapolation , which is too massive to be identified with the experimentally observed @xmath38 . in the negative - parity channel ,",
    "we obtain @xmath39 gev after the chiral extrapolation , which is rather close to the empirical value .      in order to identify this negative - parity state as the @xmath5",
    ", it is necessary to confirm that it is a compact 5q resonance state rather than an @xmath0 scattering state . for this purpose",
    ", we propose a new method with `` _ hybrid boundary condition ( hbc ) _ '' . in the standard boundary condition ,",
    "the spatially periodic bc is imposed on @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath24 quark fields .",
    "hence , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are subject to the spatially periodic bc , and s - wave @xmath0 scattering spectrum starts at @xmath42 as a consequence of the negligibly weak @xmath0 interaction in comparison with @xmath43 or @xmath44 . in hbc ,",
    "the spatial bc is twisted in a flavor - dependent manner .",
    "the spatially periodic bc is imposed on @xmath24 quark field , whereas the spatially anti - periodic bc is imposed on @xmath26 and @xmath27 quark fields . in this case , since @xmath45 and @xmath46 contain odd number of @xmath26 and @xmath27 quarks , they are subject to the spatially anti - periodic bc . due to",
    "the finiteness of the spatial box , allowed spatial momenta of @xmath40 and @xmath41 are quantized as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , and @xmath49 denotes the spatial extension of the box .",
    "note that the momentum is quantized in a different manner from the standard periodic bc case , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 have the non - zero minimum momentum as @xmath50 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath0 scattering spectrum in hbc starts at an artificially raised value as @xmath51 depending on the spatial extension of the box . on the other hand ,",
    "since the @xmath52 contains even number of @xmath26 and @xmath27 quarks , the @xmath13 is subject to the spatially periodic bc .",
    "hence , it can have the zero - spatial momentum .",
    "if the spatial size of the @xmath13 is sufficiently smaller than @xmath49 , it is safely expected that this compact 5q state should be less sensitive to the change of the spatial bc . in this case",
    ", its mass will stay at the same location .    in fig .",
    "[ hikaku ] , we show the lattice qcd result for 5q baryon . we compare the hbc results with the standard periodic bc results .",
    "the closed circles denote the results of the single - exponential fit analysis .",
    "the solid lines denotes the corresponding @xmath0 thresholds .",
    "we see that the @xmath0 thresholds are raised by 200250 mev due to hbc , and that the best fit masses are raised by consistent amount as the shifts of the @xmath0 thresholds .",
    "this implies that the negative - parity states with the mass @xmath53 gev observed in the present lattice qcd calculation is an @xmath0 scattering state rather than a compact 5q resonance .",
    "to summarize , we have performed the anisotropic lattice qcd studies of the 5q state for spin @xmath1 and isospin @xmath2 .",
    "we have obtained the lowest - lying positive - parity state at @xmath54 gev after the chiral extrapolation , which is considered to be too massive to be identified with the @xmath5 .",
    "the lowest - lying negative - parity 5q state has been found at @xmath7 gev , which is rather close to the empirical value .",
    "it is necessary to clarify whether this state is a compact 5q resonance state or an @xmath0 scattering state in order to identify it as the @xmath5 . for this purpose ,",
    "we have proposed a new method with `` _ hybrid boundary condition ( hbc ) _ '' , which can raise the s - wave @xmath0 threshold by a few hundred mev depending on the extension of the spatial box . from the hbc analysis ,",
    "it has turned out that the negative - parity state observed at @xmath55 gev is actually an @xmath0 scattering state .    in this way , we have observed no clear signals for the compact 5q resonance @xmath5 both in the negative and the positive - parity channels .",
    "note that another null - result is reported by ref.@xcite in lattice qcd .",
    "of course , one of the possible implications of these two negative results is that qcd may not accommodate the @xmath5 as a resonance pole .",
    "note that experimental existence of the @xmath5 has not yet been established so far . as an interesting possibility",
    ", these null - results may be a consequence of a possibly complicated intrinsic structures of the @xmath13 as suggested by refs.@xcite . if this is the case , the @xmath5 may not be easily reachable by the lattice qcd with a simple 5q interpolating field , and it would be desirable to introduce series of new non - local interpolating fields , which can fit such non - trivial structures @xcite .",
    "another possible implication is that the @xmath5 may have simply a different quantum number .",
    "indeed , refs.@xcite discuss the possibility of spin @xmath56 . in this respect",
    ", it would be interesting to perform lattice qcd calculation for spin 3/2 states @xcite . of course",
    ", it is necessary to perform more systematic studies in order to reveal the mysterious nature of the penta - quark @xmath5 .    9 leps collaboration ( t.  nakano et al .",
