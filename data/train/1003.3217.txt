    "<S> we discuss the heat transfer by photons between two metals coupled by a circuit containing linear reactive impedances . using a simple circuit approach , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the spectral power transmitted from one metal to the other and find that it is determined by a photon transmission coefficient , which depends on the impedances of the metals and of the coupling circuit . </S>",
    "<S> we study the total photonic power flow for different coupling impedances , both in the linear regime , where the temperature difference between the metals is small , and in the non - linear regime of large temperature differences . </S>"
