    "massive stars are _ not _ expected to be h rich at the time of explosion .",
    "yet , recent observations have questioned this picture , revealing the limitations of our current understanding of the last stages of massive star evolution and in particular the uncertainties in the commonly assumed mass loss prescriptions ( e.g. @xcite ) . here , we present observations from an extensive , broad - band monitoring campaign of sn2009ip ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sn2009ip ] ) during its double explosion in 2012 that revealed extreme mass - loss properties , raising questions about our understanding of the late stages of massive star evolution .",
    "an increasingly complex picture is emerging connecting sn progenitor stars with explosion properties .",
    "the most direct link arguably comes from the detection of progenitor stars in pre - explosion images .",
    "these efforts have been successful connecting type iip sne with the death of red supergiants ( @xmath8 , @xcite ) .",
    "however , massive progenitor stars have proven to be more elusive ( e.g. @xcite ) : sn2005gl constitutes the first direct evidence for a massive ( @xmath9 ) and h rich star to explode as a core - collapse sn , contrary to theoretical expectations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "sn2005gl belongs to the class of type iin sne ( @xcite ) .",
    "their spectra show evidence for strong interaction between the explosion ejecta and a dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) previously enriched by mass loss from the progenitor star . in order for the sn to appear as a type iin explosion ,",
    "the mass loss and the core collapse have to be _ timed _ , with mass loss occurring in the decades to years before the collapse .",
    "this timing requirement constitutes a further challenge to current evolutionary models and emphasizes the importance of the progenitor mass loss in the years before the explosion in determining its observable properties .    mass loss in massive stars",
    "can either occur through steady winds ( on a typical time scale of @xmath10 yr ) or episodic outbursts lasting months to years , reminiscent of luminous blue variable ( lbv ) eruptions ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "sn2005gl , with its lbv - like progenitor , established the first direct observational connection between sne iin and lbvs . on the other hand ,",
    "there are controversial objects like sn1961v , highlighting the present difficulty in distinguishing between a giant lbv eruption and a genuine core - collapse explosion even 50 years after the event ( @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the dividing line between sne and impostors can be ambiguous .    here",
    "we report on our extensive multi - wavelength campaign to monitor the evolution of sn2009ip , which offers an unparalleled opportunity to study the effects and causes of significant mass loss in massive stars in real time . discovered in 2009 @xcite in ngc 7259 ( spiral galaxy with brightness @xmath11 mag , @xcite ) , it was first mistaken as a faint sn candidate ( hence the name sn2009ip ) .",
    "later observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) showed the behavior of sn2009ip to be consistent instead with that of lbvs . pre - explosion hubble space telescope ( hst ) images constrain the progenitor to be a massive star with @xmath12 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , consistent with an lbv nature .",
    "the studies by @xcite and @xcite showed that sn2009ip underwent multiple explosions in rapid succession in 2009 .",
    "indeed , a number of lbv - like eruptions were also observed in 2010 and 2011 : a detailed summary can be found in @xcite and a historic light - curve is presented by @xcite . among the most important findings",
    "is the presence of blue - shifted absorption lines corresponding to ejecta traveling at a velocity of @xmath13 during the 2009 outbursts ( @xcite , @xcite ) , extending to @xmath14 in semptember 2011 @xcite .",
    "velocities this large have never been associated with lbv outbursts to date .",
    "sn2009ip re - brightened again on 2012 july 24 ( @xcite ) , only to dim considerably @xmath4 days afterwards ( hereafter referred to as the 2012a outburst ) .",
    "the appearance of high - velocity spectral features was first noted by @xcite on 2012 september 22 .",
    "this was shortly followed by the major 2012 re - brightening on september 23 ( 2012b explosion hereafter , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "sn2009ip reached @xmath15 at this time , consequently questioning the actual survival of the progenitor star : sn or impostor ?",

    "we present a comprehensive study of sn2009ip during its remarkable evolution in 2012 . using observations spanning more than 15 decades in wavelength , from the gev to the radio band , we constrain the properties of the explosion and its complex environment ,",
    "identify characteristic time scales that regulate the mass loss history of the progenitor star , and study the process of dust vaporization in the progenitor surroundings .",
    "we further predict the neutrino emission associated with this transient .",

    "[ fig:09ipvs10mc ] ) and spectral properties both during the precursor bump and the major re - brightening , as noted by @xcite .",
    "the first important conclusion is that ( i ) the precursor and the major re - brightening are _ causally _ connected events , being otherwise difficult to explain the strictly similar phenomenology observed in sn2009ip and sn2010mc , two distinct and unrelated explosions .",
    "the same conclusion is independently supported by the very short time interval between the precursor and main outburst when compared to the progenitor star lifetime , as pointed out by @xcite for sn2010mc .",
    "a second conclusion is that ( ii ) whatever causes the precursor plus major outburst phenomenology , this is _ not unique _ to sn2009ip and might represent an important evolutionary channel for massive stars .",
    "furthermore , ( iii ) sn2009ip and sn2010mc must share some fundamental properties .",

    "finally , ( iv ) whatever the physical mechanism behind , the time interval of @xmath4 days ( fig . [ fig:09ipvs10mc ] ) between the precursor explosion and the main event must be connected to some physically important time scale for the system .",
    "we employ the fast @xmath585 technique for irregularly sampled data by @xcite to search for periodicity and/or dominant time - scales in the outburst history of sn2009ip _ _ before _ _ the major 2012 explosion .",

    "we speculate on the nature of the underlying physical process in the next two sections .",
    "in section [ subsec : asymmetry ] we showed that asymmetry plays a role in the 2012 explosion , which might point to the presence of a preferred direction in the progenitor system of sn2009ip .",

    "rapid rotation strongly affects the evolution of massive stars , in particular by increasing the global mass - loss rate ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "more importantly , @xcite showed that the mass loss in rapidly rotating massive stars does not remain isotropic , but it is instead enhanced at the polar regions , thus favoring bipolar stellar winds ( e.g. @xcite , their fig .",
    "2 ) . as a result , the formation of an asymmetric ( peanut shaped ) nebula around rapidly rotating stars is very likely . additionally , rapid rotation can induce mechanical mass loss , resulting in some matter to be launched into an equatorial keplerian disk .",

    "a potential solution might be the presence of a high - velocity accretion disk wind.while the presence of a dominant time scale common to the eruptive and explosive phases makes the binary progenitor explanation particularly appealing days as orbital period implies an orbital radius @xmath609 .",

    "the outer envelope of an evolved massive star contains @xmath610 of the stellar radius but only a tiny fraction of the stellar mass .",
    "the physical mechanism leading to the 2012a outburst must have been fairly deep seated to unbind more than @xmath611 .",
    "it is furthermore required to generate a large amount of energy ( @xmath612 erg plus the energy to lift the mass out of the deep gravitational potential well ) and to explain the presence of a dominant time scale of @xmath376 days which is also shared with the observed eruption history in the years before the explosion",
    ". the mass - loss rate of at least a few @xmath613 can only be sustained for an extremely small fraction of the life of a star and in principle only for @xmath50 years , before inducing important adjustments to the stellar structure .",
    "we explore here different physical mechanisms that have been proposed to lead to substantial mass loss in the late stages of evolution of massive single stars and discuss their relevance for sn2009ip .",
    "they can basically be grouped into 4 categories : ( i ) pulsational pair - instability ; ( ii ) super - eddington fusion luminosity ; ( iii ) eddington - limit instabilities ; ( iv ) shock heating of the stellar envelope .",
    "pulsational pair - instability ( ppi , @xcite ) applies to massive stars with helium core of @xmath614 .",
    "ppi leads to partial unbinding of the star , with a sequence of eruptions accompanied by the ejection of shells of material of the stellar envelope .",
    "this mechanism has been considered as a plausible explanation for sn2009ip by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite but has been rejected by @xcite and @xcite for both sn2010mc and sn2009ip ( the leading argument being that ppi would lead to the ejection of much larger amounts of mass than the @xmath615 they infer ) .",
    "according to @xcite , a non - rotating star with zero metallicity ( z=0 ) and zams mass @xmath616 and @xmath617 meets the criteria for ppi .",
    "however , with updated prescriptions for the mass - loss rate , and assumption of solar metallicity ( which more closely represents our conditions of @xmath618 , section [ sec : metallicity ] ) @xcite predict that even stars with @xmath619 will end the c - burning phase with mass @xmath620 , below the threshold of @xmath621 to trigger ppi .",
    "while our limits on the progenitor mass of sn2009ip in sec .",
    "[ subsec : progenitor ] do not formally rule out the ppi scenario in the non - rotating case , they definitely allow for progenitors starting with much lower mass than required for the ppi to develop ( @xmath622 ) .",
    "rapidly rotating progenitors ( @xmath623 ) enter the ppi regime starting with substantially lower zams mass : @xmath624 for @xmath625 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , for @xmath626 even very massive rotating @xmath627 stars develop a core with @xmath628 , insufficient to trigger ppi @xcite . in the previous sections we constrained the progenitor of sn2009ip with zams mass @xmath629 and metallicity @xmath618 .",

    "this indicates some difficulties for rotating progenitors to reach the ppi threshold .",
    "what remains difficult to interpret both for rotating and non - rotating progenitors is the presence of a dominant time - scale of @xmath4 days : depending on the pulse properties and the physical conditions of the surviving star , the interval between pulses can be _ anywhere _ between days to decades @xcite . alternatively",
    ", convective motions stimulated by the super - eddington fusion luminosity in the core of a massive star can excite internal gravity waves ( g - mode non - radial oscillations , @xcite ) .",
    "an important fraction of the energy in gravity waves can be converted into sound waves , with the potential to unbind several @xmath635 . for a @xmath636 star , @xcite estimate that @xmath637 will be deposited into the stellar envelope .",
    "if this mechanism is responsible for the ejection of material by the 2012a explosion , the velocity @xmath638 of the unbound material inferred from our observations implies an ejecta mass @xmath639 , consistent with our estimate of the mass of the compact shell encountered by the 2012b explosion in section [ subsec : shockbo ] .",
    "however , this mechanism is likely to lead to a steady mass - loss ( e. quataert private communication ) as opposed to shell ejection and does not offer a natural explanation for the 40-day time scale involved in the process .",
    "we therefore consider the super - eddington luminosity mechanism unlikely to apply to sn2009ip and sn2010mc , ( see however @xcite ) .    with @xmath426-band observed magnitudes between @xmath640 mag and @xmath641 mag reported by @xcite , sn2009ip oscillates between @xmath50eddington and super - eddington luminosity episodes in the years preceding the double explosion in 2012 .",
    "depending on the effective temperature of the emission , @xmath642 mag corresponds to the eddington luminosity of a star with mass @xmath643 .",
    "@xmath644 would correspond to an eddington limit for a star of @xmath645 .",
    "a number of instabilities have been shown to develop in stars approaching and/or exceeding the eddington limit , actually allowing the super - eddington luminosity to persist ( e.g. @xcite ) , potentially powering lbv - like eruptions .",
    "the eruption time scale , repetition rate and ejected mass are however loosely predicted , so that it is unclear if any of these mechanisms would apply to the eruption history of sn2009ip and , even more importantly , how these are connected with the 2012 double explosion ( which clearly differs from super - eddington powered winds ) .",
    "with luminosity between @xmath646 and @xmath647 the progenitor of sn2009ip falls into the region where radiation pressure starts to have a major role in supporting the star against gravity ( see e.g. @xcite , their fig .",
    "12.1 ) : we speculate that the dominance of radiation pressure over gas pressure in the envelope might have an important role in determining the repeated ejection of shells of sn2009ip .",
    "indeed , the outer layers of massive stars close to the eddington limit and/or critical rotation are only loosely bound and might be easily ejected if enough energy is suddenly deposited .",
    "a potential source of energy deposition has been identified in thermonuclear flashes associated with shell burning @xcite . differently from the ppi , this scenario does not require the progenitor to be extremely massive .",
    "alternatively , non - radial gravity mode oscillations above the core or near to the h - burning shell could provide fresh fuel , triggering a burst of energy ( and subsequent shell ejection ) in massive stars like @xmath363car @xcite .",
    "both scenarios have the advantage to be basically driven by two parameters : the deposited energy and the envelope binding energy , naturally satisfying the `` simplicity '' criterion of section [ subsec:09ip10mc ] .",
    "finally we mention that direct numerical simulations of pre - collapse hydrodynamics by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite found eruptive instabilities due to the interaction of oxygen and silicon burning shells .",
    "the instabilities are related to turbulent convection ( and being inherently nonlinear , are invisible to conventional linear stability analysis ) .",
    "these simulations specifically predicted mass ejection prior to core collapse , suggesting that pre - collapse evolution is far more eventful than previously thought .",

    "-0.0 true cm     our modeling shows that the 2012b explosion is _ not _ powered by ni radioactive decay ( section [ subsec : limitni ] ) and demonstrates that a shock breaking out from a shell of material previously ejected by the 2012a outburst can reasonably account for the observed properties of the 2012b explosion , constraining the mass of the ejecta to @xmath648 ( section [ subsec : shockbo ] ) .",
    "this strongly suggests an explosion energy well below @xmath649 ( likely around @xmath650 erg ) , and brings to question the fate of sn2009ip : a terminal sn explosion ( @xcite ) or a sn `` impostor '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ?    a key prediction of the sn scenario is the presence of chemical elements produced by the sn nucleosynthesis ( like oxygen ) in late - time spectra , which is not expected in the case of a non - terminal explosion .",

    "our model predicts that the `` flat '' phase should be followed by a rapid decline , once the shock has reached the edge of the `` nir shell '' .",
    "we propose that sn2009ip was the consequence of the _ explosive ejection of the envelope of a massive star _ , which later interacted with shells of material ejected during previous eruption episodes . while @xmath653 is insufficient to fully unbind a massive star , its outer envelope is only loosely bound , and can be easily ejected by a lower - energy explosion .",
    "the origin of the energy deposition is not constrained as unclear is its potential relation with the possible binary nature of the system .",

    "we report a tentative detection of hard x - rays ( 15 - 150 kev range ) around the optical peak and put a solid upper limit on the hard x - ray to optical emission from sn2009ip : @xmath511 .",
    "* the collision of the ejecta with a massive shell(s ) is expected to accelerate cosmic rays and generate gev gamma - rays . using _",
    "fermi_-lat data we detect no gev radiation , consistent with the picture of ejecta crashing into a compact and dense but low - mass shell of material at small radius . *",
    "our calculations indicate that the latest outburst from sn2009ip was a bright source of neutrinos if the cr energy is comparable to the radiated energy .",
    "we demonstrate with sn2009ip how to constrain the cosmic - ray acceleration efficiency using broad band electromagnetic data and deep limits on muon neutrinos that will be available in the near future when new facilities will come online . *",
    "we speculate that the nir excess of emission is a signature of vaporization of dust grains with radius @xmath668 in a shell of material located at @xmath669 .",
    "the very high temperature associated with the nir excess remains however difficult to explain .",
    "the shell was ejected by the progenitor in the years preceding 2012 , and will be overtaken by the explosion shock during 2013 .",
    "* finally , our modeling of the 2012b explosion implies a small ejecta mass @xmath670 , with an explosion energy well below @xmath671 erg ( likely around @xmath650 erg ) , thus raising questions about the nature of sn2009ip : was it a terminal sn explosion or a sn impostor ?",
    "this analysis constrains the 2012b re - brightening of sn2009ip to be a low - energy , asymmetric explosion in a complex medium .",
    "we interpret this 2012b episode to be the _ explosive ejection of the envelope of the massive progenitor star _ that later interacted with shells of material ejected during previous eruption episodes .    to unravel the nature of the physical mechanism behind the complex phenomenology of sn2009ip , two key observational findings stand out : ( i ) its extreme similarity with sn2010mc both in terms of time scales and energetics of the precursor bump and main explosion ; ( ii ) the presence of a dominant time scale of @xmath376 days , which regulates both the progenitor outburst history and major explosion ( and which is also shared by completely independent events like sn2010mc ) .",
    "while it is clear that the physical process leading to the 2012a eruption must have been fairly deep - seated to unbind @xmath672 , it is unclear if any of the proposed mechanisms for substantial episodic mass loss ( i.e. pulsational pair instability , super - eddington fusion luminosity , eddington - limit instabilities and shock heating of the stellar envelope ) would be able to fully account for the observed properties , and in particular for the presence of dominant time scales .",
    "indeed , the presence of dominant time scales might suggest a binary progenitor .",
    "finally , the extreme similarity to sn2010mc allows us to conclude that the mechanism behind the precursor plus major outburst is _ not unique _ to sn2009ip and is likely driven by _",
    "few _ physical parameters .",
    "moreover , this eruptive dynamic might represent an important evolutionary channel for massive stars .",
    "future observations will reveal if sn2009ip was able to survive .",

    "this algorithm is suitable for irregularly sampled data with nonuniform errors and it is designed to identify the presence of periodic signals by minimizing the @xmath585 between the data and the model .",

    "this is evidence for a dominant time - scale of about 40  days , with significant power distributed on time - scales between 30 and 50 days .",
    "replicating the same analysis on time series obtained by randomizing the observed magnitudes has the effect of washing out the excess of power on those time scales .",
    "this demonstrates that the excess of power around 40 days is not due to the data sampling .",
    "additionally and independently , we calculated the lomb  scargle ( ls ; @xcite ; @xcite ) periodogram of the same time series .",
    "this is particularly suitable to unevenly sampled data sets and measures the power contributed by the different frequencies to the total variance .",
    "this reduces to the fourier power spectrum in the uniform sampling limit . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempan ] , most power is concentrated between @xmath317 and @xmath5050  days , with a peak around 40  days . to evaluate the impact of the aliasing and to quantify how significant the power is with respect to the white noise case ( i.e. no preferred time scale ) , we carried out the following monte carlo simulation .",
    "we randomized the magnitudes among the same observation times and generated @xmath702 synthetic profiles with the same variance as the real one .",
    "for each period we derived the corresponding confidence levels of @xmath16 , 90% , 99% , and 99.9% , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempan ] . comparing the real ls periodogram with the mc generated confidence levels ,",
    "we conclude that power in excess of white noise around 40  days is significant at 99.9% confidence and we identify this time scale as the dominant one in the overall variance .",
    "in addition , we applied both methods to the time profiles obtained for the v , h and r filters around the 2012 outburst .",
    "we applied both a third and a fourth degree polynomial de - trending . in all cases",

    "<S> high - cadence photometric and spectroscopic observations from the gev to the radio band obtained from a variety of ground - based and space facilities ( including the vla , swift , fermi , hst and xmm ) constrain sn2009ip to be a low energy ( @xmath0 erg for an ejecta mass @xmath1 ) and likely asymmetric explosion in a complex medium shaped by multiple eruptions of the restless progenitor star . </S>",
    "<S> most of the energy is radiated as a result of the shock breaking out through a dense shell of material located at @xmath2 with @xmath3 , ejected by the precursor outburst @xmath4 days before the major explosion . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the nir excess of emission as signature of dust vaporization of material located further out ( @xmath5 ) , the origin of which has to be connected with documented mass loss episodes in the previous years . </S>",
    "<S> our modeling predicts bright neutrino emission associated with the shock break - out if the cosmic ray energy is comparable to the radiated energy . </S>",
    "<S> we connect this phenomenology with the explosive ejection of the outer layers of the massive progenitor star , that later interacted with material deposited in the surroundings by previous eruptions . </S>",
    "<S> future observations will reveal if the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) progenitor star survived . </S>",
    "<S> irrespective of whether the explosion was terminal , sn2009ip brought to light the existence of new channels for sustained episodic mass - loss , the physical origin of which has yet to be identified . </S>"
