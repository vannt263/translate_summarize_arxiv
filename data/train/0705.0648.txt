    "electric transport properties depend on magnetic system degrees of freedom as demonstrated by e.g.  the giant- ( gmr ) and tunnel- ( tmr ) magneto - resistance effects . in these",
    "it is used that charge currents can be tuned by changing the relative orientation of magnetic moments in magnetic heterostructures.@xcite for example , the transmission through an interface between two ferromagnetic electrodes decreases as the relative angle between the electrodes magnetization directions increases , which is known as the spin valve effect.@xcite    if a non - magnetic spacer region is inserted between source and drain , the information about the relative spin orientation is mediated between source and drain by spin accumulation in the intermediate region.@xcite scattering at the interfaces may also contribute significantly to transport.@xcite manipulation of the accumulated spin opens the possibility to modify the source - drain current .",
    "such manipulation was suggested to be achieved electrically with the help of spin - orbit coupling as proposed by datta and das.@xcite it may also be accomplished magnetically , e.g.  by external magnetic fields@xcite or by additional leads.@xcite in addition , in low - dimensional systems the significant charging energy also affects transport , giving rise to the well - known coulomb staircase@xcite , but also affecting the spin - dependence of transport .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we study a magnetically - controlled quantum - dot spin transistor , in which the transport behavior is affected by the interplay of spin accumulation and coulomb charging .",
    "we consider a single - level quantum dot with strong coulomb interaction that is connected to three ferromagnetic leads .",
    "the base lead which is kept charge - current free , so that the source - drain current is magnetically affected by the base lead only via manipulation of the accumulated dot spin .",
    "there are two qualitatively different ways in which the current - free base lead affects the quantum - dot spin .",
    "one is that the base electrode offers a channel of spin relaxation .",
    "an electron with , say , spin up tunnels out of the dot and an electron with spin down tunnels in .",
    "spin - flip _ processes , which are accompanied by a spin but no charge current in the base electrode , reduce the spin accumulation on the dot .",
    "the strength of this relaxation depends on the orientation of the base electrode s magnetization direction relative to the spin accumulation .",
    "this scheme has been proposed to realize a `` spin - flip transistor '' with metallic islands in the absence of coulomb interaction.@xcite in quantum dots , however , there will also be a second contribution , related to _",
    "spin precession _ due to the exchange interaction between the quantum - dot level and ferromagnetic base electrode.@xcite in general , both types of processes play a role .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to identify and discuss the effect of both of them on the transport characteristics .",
    "the spin transistor consists of a quantum dot connected to source and drain lead by tunnel contacts .",
    "source and drain have antiparallel magnetizations so that a non - equilibrium spin is accumulated on the dot , which modifies the conductance of the device . a floating base lead can be used to influence the dot state solely by spin currents , i.e. , the source - drain conductance can be modified by the alignment of the magnetization alone . ]    in the following sec .",

    "we study a single - level quantum dot with contacts to three ferromagnetic leads [ source(left ) , drain(right ) , base(middle ) ] by tunnel junctions , described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 the first part @xmath1 models the quantum dot as an anderson impurity with a spin - degenerate electronic level @xmath2 and charging energy @xmath3 for double occupancy .",
    "each of the three leads is described as a reservoir of itinerant electrons in thermal equilibrium @xmath4 with @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 denotes the majority(minority ) spin states which have the density of states @xmath7 .",
    "the lead magnetization direction is characterized by the direction of the magnetization vector @xmath8 , while the strength of the polarization is given by its magnitude @xmath9 .",
    "the last part of the hamiltonian @xmath10 connects the four subsystems by spin - conserving tunneling between dot and leads @xmath11 the tunnel matrix elements @xmath12 consist of the ( spin - independent ) tunnel amplitude @xmath13 , which is a measure of the barrier height and thickness , times an su(2 ) rotation about the relative polar angles @xmath14 and @xmath15 between the lead s magnetization direction and the dot s spin quantization axis . the tunneling rate for electrons from lead @xmath16 with spin @xmath17 is quantified by @xmath18 , and we define @xmath19 .",
    "the system considered in this paper extends the quantum - dot spin valve studied in ref .   by the addition of a third ( base ) electrode .",
    "we choose this lead to be floating , i.e. , to carry no electric charge current .",
    "instead , it influences the quantum - dot spin , and thus the source - drain current , only by magnetic interactions .",
    "the state of the quantum dot is characterized by the probabilities @xmath20 to find the dot empty ( @xmath21 ) , singly ( @xmath22 ) , or doubly ( @xmath23 ) occupied , as well as the average spin @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the limit of weak tunnel coupling , for which each tunnel event can be uniquely attributed to one lead .",
    "therefore the kinetic equations of a quantum dot with three connecting leads appears identical to the two - lead case,@xcite whereby the sum over the leads hast to be extended to include also the base ( middle ) lead . in lowest order in the tunnel coupling @xmath26 ,",

    "in particular , an accumulation of spin in the quantum dot due to a finite source - drain voltage will reduce electric transport , which constitutes the spin valve effect .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study how transport through this spin valve can be controlled in a purely magnetic way by means of the third lead . in order for this control to be purely magnetic",
    "we keep the base electrode floating , i.e. , it does not carry any net charge current , @xmath34 .",
    "the base lead influences the quantum - dot spin in two qualitatively different ways .",
    "first , the base electrode can act as ( incoherent ) sink for spin currents , thus offering a channel of spin relaxation .",
    "second , the exchange field originating from the tunnel contact can give rise to coherent precession of the quantum - dot spin .",
    "both effects could lead to a transistorlike behavior as discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section we concentrate on the quantum - dot spin transistor as shown in fig .",

    "tunneling processes from or to ferromagnetic leads generate a finite spin accumulation as well as offering relaxation channels , which limit the spin lifetime . in ref .",
    "we chose to call the first and second terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) the accumulation and relaxation terms , respectively . for the source and drain leads we keep this interpretation .",
    "the separation of the tunneling processes into spin accumulation and relaxation terms is to some degree arbitrary . to define a proper spin lifetime boundary conditions need to be specified . in the case of the base lead ,",
    "the condition @xmath34 allows us to rewrite the contribution of the middle ( base ) lead @xmath48 to the spin kinetic equation ( [ eq : s ] ) as @xmath49    \\left [ { \\mathbf s } - ( { \\mathbf s } \\cdot { \\mathbf p}_m ) { \\mathbf p}_m \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\    + { \\mathbf s } \\times { \\mathbf b}_m \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by removing the spin - accumulation term from the kinetic equation we observe that the damping becomes anisotropic .",

    "the imaginary part of the mixing conductance is proportional to the polarization @xmath97 and to @xmath98 . to get the total transfer of angular momentum between dot and lead , we need to integrate over all frequencies @xmath32 , which gives rise to a principal value integral with integrand @xmath99 , in agreement with a full green s function formulation of the spin current through a tunnel barrier.@xcite",

    "this point becomes more transparent by considering that the off - diagonal greater and lesser green s functions vanish in the free limit , while in zeroth - order tunnel coupling @xmath95 they do not , but rather describe nonequilibrium spin accumulation on the quantum dot ."
