    "the above proof goes through because the constant factor in front of the first term in is precisely @xmath286 .",
    "if this constant factor is different from @xmath286 then the connection with balayage measures breaks down , and in fact if the constant is larger than @xmath286 then the energy functional is not bounded from below anymore .",
