    "the idea of quantization has proved its importance to bridge the commutative and noncommutative versions of certain algebraic structures and promote better understanding various aspects of the latter versions .",
    "one popular structure studied for the last three decades is the quantized coordinate ring @xmath4 of @xmath1 matrices over a field @xmath2 , where @xmath5 is a nonzero element of @xmath2 ; it is usually called the _ algebra of @xmath1 quantum matrices_. here @xmath6 is the @xmath2-algebra generated by the entries ( indeterminates ) of an @xmath1 matrix @xmath7 subject to the following ( quasi)commutation relations due to manin  @xcite : for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 this paper is devoted to quadratic identities for minors of quantum matrices ( usually called quantum minors or quantized minors or @xmath5-minors ) . for representative cases , aspects and applications of such identities , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ( where the list is incomplete ) .",
    "we present a novel , and rather transparent , combinatorial method which enables us to completely characterize and efficiently verify homogeneous quadratic identities of universal character that are valid for quantum minors .",
    "the identities of our interest can be written as @xmath11_q\\ , [ i'_i|j'_i]_q \\colon i=1,\\ldots , n)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 ,  @xmath13 , and @xmath14_q$ ] denotes the quantum minor whose rows and columns are indexed by @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] , respectively .",
    "( hereinafter , for a positive integer @xmath17 , we write @xmath18 $ ] for @xmath19 . )",
    "the homogeneity means that each of the sets @xmath20 is invariant of @xmath21 , and the term `` universal '' means that  ( [ eq : q_ident ] ) should be valid independently of @xmath22 and a @xmath5-matrix ( a matrix whose entries obey manin s relations and , possibly , additional ones ) .",
    "note that any cortege @xmath23 may be repeated in  ( [ eq : q_ident ] ) many times .",
    "our approach is based on two sources .",
    "the first one is the _ flow - matching method _ elaborated in  @xcite to characterize quadratic identities for usual minors ( viz . for @xmath24 ) . in that case",
    "the identities are viewed simpler than  ( [ eq : q_ident ] ) , namely , as @xmath25\\ , [ i'_i|j'_i ] \\colon i=1,\\ldots , n)=0.\\ ] ] ( in fact ,  @xcite deals with natural analogs of  ( [ eq : com_ident ] ) over commutative semirings , e.g. the tropical semiring @xmath26 . ) in the method of  @xcite , each cortege @xmath27 is associated with a certain set @xmath28 of _ feasible matchings _ on the set @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 denotes the symmetric difference @xmath31 , and @xmath32 the disjoint union of sets @xmath33 ) . the main theorem in  @xcite asserts that  ( [ eq : com_ident ] ) is valid ( universally ) if and only if the families @xmath34 and @xmath35 of corteges @xmath36 with signs @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , are _ balanced _ , in the sense that the total families of feasible matchings for corteges occurring in @xmath34 and in @xmath35 are equal .",
    "the main result of this paper gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the quantum version ( in theorems  [ tm : nec_q_bal ] and  [ tm : suff_q_bal ] ) .",
    "it says that  ( [ eq : q_ident ] ) is valid ( universally ) if and only if the families of corteges @xmath34 and @xmath35 along with the function @xmath39 are @xmath5-_balanced _ , which now means the existence of a bijection between the feasible matchings for @xmath34 and @xmath35 that is agreeable with @xmath39 in a certain sense .",
    "the proof of necessity ( theorem  [ tm : nec_q_bal ] ) considers non-@xmath5-balanced @xmath40 and explicitly constructs a certain graph determining a @xmath5-matrix for which  ( [ eq : q_ident ] ) is violated when @xmath2 is a field of characteristic 0 and @xmath5 is transcendental over @xmath41 .",
    "the second source of our approach is the path method due to casteels  @xcite .",
    "he associated with an @xmath1 cauchon diagram @xmath42 of  @xcite a directed planar graph @xmath43 with @xmath44 distinguished vertices @xmath45 in which the remaining vertices correspond to white cells @xmath46 in the diagram @xmath42 and are labeled as @xmath47 .",
    "an example is illustrated in the picture .",
    "the labels @xmath47 , regarded as indeterminates , are assumed to ( quasi)commute as @xmath48 ( which is viewed `` simpler '' than  ( [ eq : xijkl ] ) ) .",
    "these labels determine weights of edges and , further , weights of paths of @xmath49 . the latter give rise to the _ path matrix _ @xmath50 of size @xmath1 , of which @xmath46-th entry is the sum of weights of paths starting at @xmath51 and ending at @xmath52 .",
    "the path matrix @xmath53 has three important properties .",
    "( i ) it is a @xmath5-matrix , and therefore , @xmath54 gives a homomorphism of @xmath6 to the corresponding algebra @xmath55 generated by the @xmath56 .",
    "( ii ) @xmath50 admits an analog of lindstrm s lemma  @xcite : for any @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] with @xmath57 , the minor @xmath14_q$ ] of @xmath50 can be expressed as the sum of weights of systems of _ disjoint paths _ from @xmath58 to @xmath59 in @xmath49 .",
    "( iii ) from cauchon s algorithm  @xcite interpreted in graph terms in  @xcite it follows that : if the diagram @xmath42 is maximal ( i.e. , has no black cells ) , then @xmath50 becomes a _",
    "generic @xmath5-matrix _ , see corollary  3.2.5 in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a more general class of planar graphs @xmath49 with horizontal and vertical edges , called _ se - graphs _",
    ", and show that they satisfy the above properties  ( i)(ii ) as well .",
    "our goal is to characterize quadratic identities just for the class of path matrices of se - graphs @xmath49 .",
    "since this class contains a generic @xmath5-matrix , the identities are automatically valid in @xmath6 .",
    "we take an advantage from the representation of @xmath5-minors of path matrices via systems of disjoint paths , or _ flows _ in our terminology , and the desired results are obtained by applying a combinatorial machinery of handling flows in se - graphs .",
    "our method of establishing or verifying one or another identity admits a rather transparent implementation and we illustrate the method by enlightening graphical diagrams .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : prelim ] contains basic definitions and backgrounds .",
    "section  [ sec : flows ] defines flows and path matrices for se - graphs and states lindstrm s type theorem for them .",
    "section  [ sec : double ] is devoted to crucial ingredients of the method .",
    "it describes _ exchange operations _ on _ double flows _ ( pairs of flows related to corteges @xmath23 ) and expresses such operations on the language of planar matchings .",
    "the main working tool of the whole proof , stated in this section and proved in appendix  b , is theorem  [ tm : single_exch ] giving a @xmath5-relation between double flows before and after an ordinary exchange operation . using this ,",
    "section  [ sec : q_relat ] proves the sufficiency in the main result : ( [ eq : q_ident ] ) is valid if the corresponding @xmath40 are @xmath5-balanced ( theorem  [ tm : suff_q_bal ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : examples ] is devoted to illustrations of our method .",
    "it explains how to obtain , with the help of the method , rather transparent proofs for several representative examples of quadratic identities , in particular : ( a ) the pure commutation of @xmath14_q$ ] and @xmath60_q$ ] when @xmath61 and @xmath62 ; ( b ) a quasicommutation of _ flag @xmath5-minors _ @xmath63_q$ ] and @xmath64_q$ ] as in leclerc - zelevinsky s theorem  @xcite ; ( c ) identities on flag @xmath5-minors involving triples @xmath65 and quadruples @xmath66 ; ( d ) dodgson s type identity ; ( e ) two general quadratic identities on flag @xmath5-minors from  @xcite occurring in descriptions of quantized grassmannians and flag varieties . in section  [ sec : necess ] we prove the necessity of the @xmath5-balancedness condition for validity of quadratic identities ( theorem  [ tm : nec_q_bal ] ) ; here we rebuild a corresponding construction from  @xcite to obtain , in case of the non-@xmath5-balancedness , an se - graph @xmath49 such that the identity for its path matrix is false ( in a special case of @xmath2 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] poses the problem : when an identity in the commutative case , such as  ( [ eq : com_ident ] ) , can be turned , by choosing an appropriate @xmath39 , into the corresponding identity for the quantized case ?",
    "for example , this is impossible for the trivial identity @xmath63\\,[j]=[j]\\,[i]$ ] with usual flag minors when @xmath67 are not weakly separated , as is shown in  @xcite . also this section gives a generalization of leclerc - zelevinsky s quasicommutation theorem to arbitrary ( non - flag ) quantum minors ( theorem  [ tm : generallz ] ) and discusses additional results .    finally , appendix  a exhibits several auxiliary lemmas needed to us and proves the above - mentioned lindstrm s type result for se - graphs , and appendix  b gives the proof of theorem  [ tm : single_exch ] ( which is rather technical ) .",
    "throughout , by a _ graph _ we mean a directed graph . a",

    "when it is not confusing , we may use for @xmath78 the abbreviated notation via vertices : @xmath82 , or edges @xmath83 .",
    "also , using standard terminology in graph theory , for a directed edge @xmath84 , we say that @xmath85 _ leaves _ @xmath86 and _ enters _",
    "@xmath87 , and that @xmath86 is the _ tail _ and @xmath87 is the _ head _ of @xmath85",
    ".      it will be convenient for us to visualize matrices in the cartesian form : for an @xmath1 matrix @xmath88 , the row indices @xmath89 are assumed to increase upwards , and the column indices @xmath90 from left to right .",
    "as mentioned above , we deal with the _ quantized coordinate ring _",
    "@xmath4 generated by indeterminates @xmath91 satisfying relations  ( [ eq : xijkl ] ) , shortly called the algebra of @xmath1 _ quantum matrices_. a somewhat `` simpler '' object is the _ quantum affine space _ @xmath92 , the @xmath2-algebra generated by indeterminates @xmath47",
