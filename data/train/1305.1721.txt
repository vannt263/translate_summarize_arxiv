    "@xcite observed that the motion of plastic tracer microbeads in a reconstituted mesh of cross - linked actin filaments is characterized by anomalous diffusion of the form @xmath0 of the ensemble averaged mean squared displacement ( msd ) .",
    "here , @xmath1 is the anomalous diffusion exponent of physical dimension @xmath2=\\mathrm{cm } ^2/\\mathrm{sec}^{\\alpha}$ ] , and the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath3 is in the subdiffusive range @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is the probability density function to find the test particle at position @xmath6 at time @xmath7 .",
    "wong et al . demonstrated that the motion of the microbeads is represented by a random walk with subsequent immobilization events of the beads in ` cages ' within the network @xcite .",
    "the durations @xmath8 of these immobilization periods were shown to follow the distribution @xmath9 with the scaling exponent @xmath3 .",
    "the exponent @xmath3 turns out to be a function of the ratio between the bead size and the typical mesh size .",
    "thus , when the bead size is larger than the mesh size , the bead becomes fully immobilized , @xmath10 .",
    "conversely , when the bead is much smaller than the typical mesh size , it moves like a brownian particle [ @xmath11 , in eq .",
    "] , almost undisturbed by the actin mesh .",
    "however , when the bead size is comparable to the mesh size , the motion of the bead is impeded by the mesh , giving rise to a saltatory bead motion in between cages .",
    "while the measured distribution ( [ wtdist ] ) of immobilization times indeed captures the statistics of the long time movement of the beads , the measured trajectories also exhibit an additional noise , superimposed to the jump motion according to the law ( [ wtdist ] ) @xcite .",
    "this additional noise is visible as jiggling around a typical position during sojourn periods of the bead , and appears like regular white noise .    above example",
    "is representative for the task of physical analysis of single particle tracking experiments .",
    "indeed , following single particles such as large labeled molecules , viruses , or artificial tracers in the environment of living cells has become a standard technique in many laboratories , since it reveals the individual trajectories without the problem of ensemble averaging .",
    "however , the large amount of potentially noisy data also poses a practical challenge . in physics and mathematics ideal stochastic processes",
    "have been investigated for many years , including brownian motion , fractional brownian motion , continuous time random walks , lvy flights , etc . while these can be reasonable approximations for the physical reality",
    ", they rarely represent the whole story . in many cases ,",
    "a superposition of at least two types of stochastic motion are found , such as the ` contamination ' of the pure stop - and - go motion described by the waiting time distribution ( [ wtdist ] ) with additional noise in the above example of the tracer beads in the actin mesh .",
    "similarly , weigel et al . in their study of protein channel motion in the walls of living human kidney cells observed a superposition of stochastic motion governed by the law ( [ wtdist ] ) and motion patterns corresponding to diffusion on a fractal @xcite .",
    "tabei et al .",
    "show that the motion of insulin granules in living min6 cells is best explained by a hybrid model in which fractional brownian motion is subordinated to continuous time random walk subdiffusion @xcite . finally , jeon et al .",
    "find that the motion of lipid granules in living yeast cells is governed by continuous time random walk motion at short times , turning over to fractional brownian motion at longer times @xcite .",
    "even if the trajectories are ideal , in the lab we always have to deal with additional sources of noise , for instance , the motion within the sample may become disturbed by a slow , random drift of the object stage in the microscope setup , or simply by the diffusive motion on the cover slip of a living cell , inside which the actual motion occurs that we want to follow .    in recent years a tool box for data analysis was developed by several groups , in particular , in the context of diffusion of tracers in the microscopic cellular environment .",
    "these also include fundamental aspects of statistical physics such as the ergodic properties of the underlying process and the irreproducible nature of the time averages of the data @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge these analysis methods and the fundamental properties of statistical mechanics ( that is , ergodicity ) have not been tested in the presence of additional noise .",
    "for instance , if we encounter a non - ergodic process superimposed with an ergodic one , as defined precisely below , what will we find as the result of such an experiment ? here we develop and study in detail a new framework for the motion of a test particle , the _ noisy continuous time random walk ( nctrw ) _ subject simultaneously to a power - law distribution ( [ wtdist ] ) of sojourn times and additional gaussian noise .",
    "interestingly , the noise turns out to have a dramatic effect on the time averaged msd , typically evaluated in single particle tracking experiments , but a trivial effect on the ensemble averaged msd .",
    "we hope that this contribution will be a step towards more realistic modeling of trajectories of single molecules , but also of other diffusive motions of particles in complex environments .",
    "our analysis is based on two different scenarios for the additional gaussian noise .",
    "thus , we will consider ( i ) a regular diffusive motion on top of the power - law sojourn times ( [ wtdist ] ) .",
    "this scenario mirrors effects such as the diffusion on the cover slip of the biological cell , in which the actual motion occurs that we want to monitor .",
    "( ii ) we study an ornstein - uhlenbeck noise with a typical amplitude which may reflect an intrinsically noisy environment , such as in the case of the tracer beads in the actin network .",
    "we will study the msd of the resulting motion both in the sense of the conventional ensemble average and , for its relevance in the analysis of single particle tracking measurement , the time average .",
    "moreover we demonstrate how a varying strength of the additional noise may blur the result of stochastic diagnosis methods introduced recently , such as the scatter of amplitudes of time averaged msds around the average over an ensemble of trajectories , or the @xmath12-variation method .",

    "in this section we briefly review the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) model and the behavior of ctrw time series .",
    "moreover , we present some common methods to analyze traces obtained from single particle tracking experiments or simulations .",
    "anomalous diffusion of the subdiffusive form ( [ msd ] ) with @xmath4 is quite commonly observed in a large variety of systems and on many different scales @xcite .",
    "examples range from microscopic systems such as the motion of small tracer particles in living biological cells and similar crowded systems @xcite , over the motion of charge carriers in amorphous semiconductors @xcite to the dispersion of chemical tracers in groundwater systems @xcite .    a prominent model to describe the subdiffusion law ( [ msd ] )",
    "is given by the montroll - weiss - scher continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) @xcite .",
    "originally applied to describe extensive data from the stochastic motion of charge carriers in amorphous semiconductors @xcite , the ctrw model finds applications in many areas .",
    "_ inter alia _",
    ", ctrw subdiffusion was shown to underlie the motion of microbeads in reconstituted actin networks @xcite , the subdiffusion of lipid granules in living yeast cells @xcite of protein channels in human kidney cells @xcite , and insulin granules in min6 cells @xcite , as well as the temporal spreading of tracer chemicals in groundwater aquifers @xcite .",
    "while the sojourn times in a subdiffusive ctrw follow the law ( [ wtdist ] ) , the length of individual jumps is governed by a distribution @xmath13 of jump lengths , with finite variance @xmath14 . in the simplest case of a jump process on a lattice ,",
    "each jump is of the length of the lattice constant .",
    "physically , the power - law form ( [ wtdist ] ) of sojourn times may arise due to multiple trapping events in a quenched energy landscape with exponentially distributed depths of traps @xcite .",
    "subdiffusive ctrws macroscopically exhibit long - tailed memory effects , as characterized by the dynamic equation for the probability density function @xmath15 containing fractional differential operators , see below @xcite .    usually , we think in terms of the ensemble average ( [ msd ] ) when we talk about the msd of a diffusive process .",
    "however , starting with ivar nordlund s seminal study of the brownian motion of a slowly sedimenting mercury droplet @xcite and now routinely performed even on the level of single molecules @xcite , the time series @xmath16 obtained from measuring the trajectory of an individual particle is evaluated in terms of the _ time averaged _ msd @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the so - called lag time , and @xmath19 is the overall measurement time . for brownian motion",
    ", the time averaged msd ( [ tamsd ] ) is equivalent to the ensemble averaged msd ( [ msd ] ) , @xmath20 , if only the measurement time @xmath19 is sufficiently long to ensure self - averaging of the process along the trajectory .",
    "this fact is a direct consequence of the ergodic nature of brownian motion @xcite . to obtain reliable behaviors for the time averaged msd for trajectories with finite @xmath19 one often introduces the average @xmath21 over several individual trajectories @xmath22 .",
    "what happens when the process is anomalous , of the form ( [ msd ] ) ?",
    "there exist anomalous diffusion processes , that are ergodic in the above sense that for sufficiently long @xmath19 we observe the equivalence @xmath23 .",
    "prominent examples are given by diffusion on random fractal geometries @xcite , as well as fractional brownian motion and the related fractional langevin equation motion for which ergodicity is approached algebraically @xcite .",
    "such behavior was in fact corroborated in particle tracking experiments in crowded environments @xcite and simulations of lipid bilayer systems @xcite . in superdiffusive",
    "lvy walks time and ensemble averaged msds differ merely by a factor @xcite .",
    "however , the diverging sojourn time in the subdiffusive ctrw processes naturally causes weak ergodicity breaking in the sense that even for extremely long measurement times @xmath19 ensemble and time averages no longer coincide @xcite . for the time",
    "averaged msd the consequences are far - reaching .",
    "thus , for subdiffusive ctrw we find the somewhat counterintuitive result that the time averaged msd for free motion scales _ linearly _ with the lag time , @xmath24 for @xmath25 , and thus @xmath26 @xcite . in particular , the result @xmath27 decreases with the measurement time @xmath19 , an effect of ageing .",
    "concurrently , the msd of subdiffusive ctrws depends on the time difference between the preparation of the system and the start of the measurement @xcite . under confinement , while the ensemble averaged msd saturates towards the thermal value , the time averaged msd continues to grow as @xmath28 as long as @xmath25 @xcite . another important consequence of the weakly non - ergodic behavior is that the time averaged msd ( [ tamsd ] ) remains irreproducible even in the limit of @xmath29 : the amplitude of individual time averaged msd curves @xmath30 scatters significantly between different trajectories , albeit with a well - defined distribution @xcite . in other words",
    ", this scatter of amplitudes corresponds to a distribution of diffusion constants @xcite .",
    "active transport of molecules in the cell exhibits superdiffusion with non - reproducible results for the time averages @xcite , a case treated theoretically only recently @xcite .    to pin down a given stochastic mechanism underlying some measured trajectories ,",
    "several diagnosis methods have been developed .",
    "thus , one may analyze the first passage behavior @xcite , moment ratios and the statistics of mean maximal excursions @xcite , the velocity autocorrelation @xcite , the statistics of the apparent diffusivities @xcite , or the @xmath12-variation of the data @xcite . in the following",
    "we analyze the sensitivity of the time averaged msd and its amplitude scatter as well as the @xmath12-variation method to noise , that is superimposed to naked subdiffusive ctrws . in particular , we show that at larger amplitudes of the additional noise the ctrw - inherent weak non - ergodicity may become completely masked .      before proceeding to define the nctrw process , we present a brief review of several techniques developed recently for the analysis of single particle trajectories .          already from the time averaged msd @xmath31 of individual particle traces important",
    "information on the nature of the process may be extracted , provided that the measurement time @xmath19 is sufficiently long .",
    "thus , for ergodic processes the time and ensemble averaged msd are equivalent , @xmath32 . a significant difference between both quantities points at non - ergodic behavior .",
    "in particular , the scatter of amplitudes ( distribution of diffusion constants ) between individual traces @xmath33 turns out to be a quite reliable measure for the ( non-)ergodicity of a process .",
    "thus , in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath34 the distribution of amplitudes @xmath35 has a gaussian profile centered on the ergodic value @xmath36 for finite - time ergodic processes @xcite .",
    "its width narrows with increasing @xmath19 , eventually approaching the sharp distribution @xmath37 at @xmath38 , i.e. , each trajectory gives exactly the same result , equivalent to the ensemble averaged msd . for subdiffusive ctrw processes",
    "@xmath35 is quite broad and has a finite value at @xmath39 for completely stalled trajectories @xcite . for @xmath40",
    "the maximum of the distribution is at @xmath39 , while for @xmath41 the maximum is located at @xmath36 .",
    "the non - gaussian distribution @xmath35 for subdiffusive ctrws is almost independent of @xmath19 , and its shape is already well established even for relatively short trajectories @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12-variation test was recently promoted as a tool to distinguish ctrw and fbm - type subdiffusion @xcite .",

    "the sum @xmath59 appears independent of @xmath56 and proportional to time @xmath7 , as expected . for the ornstein - uhlenbeck noise @xmath54",
    "we observe that @xmath60 scales linearly with @xmath7 and the slope decreases with growing @xmath56 , indicating a convergence to zero . also @xmath59 is linear in @xmath7 . for smaller @xmath56 ,",
    "the slope increases with @xmath56 and saturates at large @xmath56 .",

    "a more detailed description of the @xmath12-variation for ornstein - uhlenbeck noise and ctrw subdiffusion is found in appendix [ app_pvar ] .",
    "in this section we define the nctrw model and describe our simulations scheme used in the following sections .",
    "we consider an nctrw process @xmath16 in which ordinary ctrw subdiffusion @xmath55 with anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath4 is superimposed with the gaussian noise @xmath62 , @xmath63 that means that the gaussian process @xmath64 is additive and thus independent of @xmath65 .",
    "the relative strength of the additional gaussian noise is controlled by the amplitude parameter @xmath66 . in this study",
    "we consider the following two gaussian processes : ( 1 ) in the first case @xmath64 is a simple brownian diffusive process @xmath53 with zero mean @xmath67 and variance @xmath68 . as mentioned , physically this could represent the ( slow ) diffusion of a living bacteria or endothelial cell on the cover slip while we want to record the motion of a tracer inside the cell , or the random drifting of the experimental stage .",

    "stochastic processes of this second kind , for example , likely mimic the motion of a bead confined in a polymer network or immersed in a macromolecularly crowded environment , where the thermal agitation of the confining environment gives rise to the random fluctuation of the position of the trapped tracer particle around some average value .    according to the definition ,",

    "the pdf @xmath69 satisfies the fractional fokker - planck equation @xcite @xmath75 where the riemann - liouville fractional derivative of @xmath15 is @xmath76 physically , this fractional operator thus represents a memory integral with a slowly decaying kernel . from definition ( [ superimdef ] )",
