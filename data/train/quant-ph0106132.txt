    "in this article we present an analysis of quantum mechanics and its problems and paradoxes taking into account some of the results and insights that have been obtained during the last two decades by investigations that are commonly classified in the field of ` quantum structures research ' .",
    "we will concentrate on these aspects of quantum mechanics that have been investigated in our group in fund at the free university of brussels .",
    "we try to be as clear and self contained as possible : firstly because the article is also aimed at scientists not specialized in quantum mechanics , and secondly because we believe that some of the results and insights that we have obtained in brussels present the deep problems of quantum mechanics in a simple and new way .",
    "the study of the structure of quantum mechanics is almost as old as quantum mechanics itself .",
    "the fact that the two early versions of quantum mechanics - the matrix mechanics of werner heisenberg and the wave mechanics of erwin schrdinger - were shown to be structurally equivalent to what is now called standard quantum mechanics , made it already clear in the early days that the study of the structure itself would be very important .",
    "the foundations of much of this structure are already present in the book of john von neumann [ 1 ] , and if we refer to standard quantum mechanics we mean the formulation of the theory as it was first presented there in a complete way .",
    "standard quantum mechanics makes use of a sophisticated mathematical apparatus , and this is one of the reasons that it is not easy to explain it to a non specialist audience . upon",
    "reflecting how we would resolve this ` presentation ' problem for this paper we have chosen the following approach : most , if not all , deep quantum mechanical problems appear already in full , for the case of the ` most simple ' of all quantum models , namely the model for the spin of a spin@xmath0 quantum particle . therefore we have chosen to present the technical aspects of this paper as much as possible for the description of this most simple quantum model , and to expose the problems by making use of its quantum mechanical and quantum structural description .",
    "the advantage is that the structure needed to explain the spin model is simple and only requires a highschool background in mathematics .",
    "the study of quantum structures has been motivated mainly by two types of shortcomings of standard quantum mechanics .",
    "( 1 ) there is no straightforward physical justification for the use of the abstract mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics . by introducing an axiomatic approach the mathematical apparatus of standard quantum mechanics can be derived from more general structures that can be based more easily on physical concepts ( 2 ) almost none of the mathematical concepts used in standard quantum mechanics are operationally defined . as a consequence",
    "there has also been a great effort to elaborate an operational foundation .",
    "relativity theory , formulated in great part by one person , albert einstein , is founded on the concept of ` event ' , which is a concept that is physically well defined and understood . within relativity theory itself ,",
    "the events are represented by the points of a four dimensional space - time continuum . in this way",
    ", relativity theory has a well defined physical and mathematical base .",
    "quantum mechanics on the contrary was born in a very obscure way .",
    "matrix mechanics was constructed by werner heisenberg in a mainly technical effort to explain and describe the energy spectrum of the atoms .",
    "wave mechanics , elaborated by erwin schrdinger , seemed to have a more solid physical base : a general idea of wave - particle duality , in the spirit of louis de broglie or niels bohr .",
    "but then paul adrien maurice dirac and later john von neumann proved that the matrix mechanics of heisenberg and the wave mechanics of schrdinger are equivalent : they can be constructed as two mathematical representations of one and the same vector space , the hilbert space .",
    "this fundamental result indicated already that the ` de broglie wave ' and the ` bohr wave ' are not physical waves and that the state of a quantum entity is an abstract concept : a vector in an abstract vector space .    referring again to what we mentioned to be the two main reasons for studying quantum structures",
    ", we can state now more clearly : the study of quantum structures has as primary goal the elaboration of quantum mechanics with a physical and mathematical base that is as clear as the one that exists in relativity theory .",
    "we remark that the initial aim of quantum structures research was not to ` change ' the theory - although it ultimately proposes a fundamental change of the standard theory as will be outlined in this paper - but to elaborate a clear and well defined base for it .    for this purpose",
    "it is necessary to introduce clear and physically well defined basic concepts , like the events in the theory of relativity , and to identify the mathematical structure that these basic concepts have to form to be able to recover standard quantum mechanics .    in 1936 , garret birkhoff and john von neumann , wrote an article entitled  the logic of quantum mechanics \" .",
    "they show that if one introduces the concept of ` operational proposition ' and its representation in standard quantum mechanics by an orthogonal projection operator of the hilbert space , it can be shown that the set of the ` experimental propositions ' does not form a boolean algebra , as it the case for the set of propositions of classical logic [ 2 ] . as a consequence of this article",
    "the field called ` quantum logic ' came into existence : an investigation on the logic of quantum mechanics .",
    "an interesting idea was brought forward .",
    "relativity theory is a theory based on the concept of ` event ' and a mathematical structure of a four dimensional space - time continuum .",
    "this space - time continuum contains a non euclidean geometry .",
    "could it be that the article of birkhoff and von neumann indicates that quantum mechanics should be based on a non boolean logic in the same sense as relativity theory is based on a non euclidean geometry ?",
    "this is a fascinating idea , because if quantum mechanics were based on a non boolean logic , this would perhaps explain why paradoxes are so abundant in quantum mechanics : the paradoxes would then arise because classical boolean logic is used to analyze a situation that intrinsically incorporates a non classical , non boolean logic .",
    "following this idea quantum logic was developed as a new logic and also as a detailed study of the logico - algebraic structures that are contained in the mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics .",
    "the systematic study of the logico - algebraic structures related to quantum mechanics was very fruitful and we refer to the paper that david foulis published in this book for a good historical account [ 3 ] . on the philosophical question of whether quantum logic constitutes a fundamental new logic for nature",
    "a debate started .",
    "a good overview of this discussion can be found in the book by max jammer [ 4 ] .    we want to put forward our own personal opinion about this matter and explain why the word ` quantum logic ' was not the best word to choose to indicate the scientific activity that has been taking place within this field .",
    "if ` logic ' , following the characterization of boole , is the formalization of the ` process of our reflection ' , then quantum logic is not a new logic .",
    "indeed , we obviously reflect following the same formal rules whether we reflect about classical parts of reality or whether we reflect about quantum parts of reality .",
    "birkhoff and von neumann , when they wrote their article in 1936 , were already aware of this , and that is why they introduced the concept of ` experimental proposition ' .",
    "it could indeed be that , even if we reason within the same formal structure about quantum entities as we do about classical entities , the structure of the ` experimental propositions ' that we can use are different in both cases . with experimental proposition",
    "is meant a proposition that is connected in a well defined way with an experiment that can test this proposition .",
    "we will explicitly see later in this paper that there is some truth in this idea .",
    "indeed , the set of experimental propositions connected to a quantum entity has a different structure than the set of experimental propositions connected to a classical entity .",
    "we believe however that this difference in structure of the sets of experimental propositions is only a little piece of the problem , and even not the most important one ] .",
    "it is our opinion that the difference between the logico - algebraic structures connected to a quantum entity and the logico - algebraic structures connected to a classical entity is due to the fact that the structures of our ` possibilities of active experimenting ' with these entities is different .",
    "not only the logical aspects of these possibilities of active experimenting but the profound nature of these possibilities of active experimenting is different . and this is not a subjective matter due to , for example , our incapacity of experimenting actively in the same way with a quantum entity as with a classical entity .",
    "it is the profound difference in nature of the quantum entity that is at the origin of the fact that the structure of our possibilities of active experimenting with this entity is different .",
    "we could proceed now by trying to explain in great generality what we mean with this statement and we refer the reader to [ 6 ] for such a presentation . in this paper",
    "we will explain what we mean mostly by means of a simple example .",
    "as we have stated in the introduction , we will analyze the problems of quantum mechanics by means of simple models .",
    "the first model that we will introduce has been proposed at earlier occasions ( see [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] and [ 9 ] ) and we have named it the ` quantum machine ' .",
    "it will turn out to be a real macroscopic mechanical model for the spin of a spin@xmath1 quantum entity .",
    "we will only need the mathematics of highschool level to introduce it .",
    "this means that also the readers that are not acquainted with the sophisticated mathematics of general quantum mechanics can follow all the calculations , only needing to refresh perhaps some of the old high school mathematics .",
    "we will introduce the example of the quantum machine model step by step , and before we do this we need to explain shortly how we represent our ordinary three dimensional space by means of a real three dimensional vector space .",
    "we can represent the three dimensional euclidean space , that is also the space in which we live and in which our classical macroscopic reality exists , mathematically by means of a three dimensional real vector space denoted @xmath2 .",
    "we do this by choosing a fixed origin @xmath3 of space and representing each point @xmath4 of space as a vector @xmath5 with begin - point @xmath3 and end - point @xmath4 ( see fig 1 ) .",
    "such a vector @xmath5 has a direction , indicated by the arrow , and a length , which is the length of the distance from @xmath3 to the point @xmath4 .",

    "later we will treat the general case .",
    "let us now describe the experiment .",
    "once the elastic is installed , the particle @xmath4 falls from its original place @xmath5 orthogonally onto the elastic , and sticks to it ( fig 8,b ) .",
    "then , the elastic breaks at some arbitrary point . consequently the particle @xmath4 , attached to one of the two pieces of the elastic ( fig 8,c ) , is pulled to one of the two end - points @xmath61 or @xmath62 ( fig 8,d ) . now , depending on whether the particle @xmath4 arrives in @xmath61 ( as in fig 8) or in @xmath62 , we give the outcome @xmath64 or @xmath65 to the experiment . we will denote this experiment by the symbol @xmath66 and the set of experiments connected to the quantum machine by @xmath67 .",

    "the set of experiments that we will consider for this one quantum particle is the set of all possible stern - gerlach experiments , for each direction @xmath61 of space , which we denote by @xmath88 .",

    "suppose that we perform a second stern - gerlach experiment on this beam , with the gradient of the magnetic field in the same direction @xmath61 as in the first preparing stern - gerlach apparatus .",
    "we will then see that now the emerging beam is not divided into two beams .",
    "all particles of the beam are deviated upwards and none of them is absorbed by the plate .",
    "this means that the first experiment has ` prepared ' the particles of the beam in such a way that it can be predicted that they will all be deviated upwards : in physics we say that the particles have been prepared in a spin state in direction @xmath61 . since we can make such a preparation for each direction of space",
    "@xmath61 it follows that the spin of a spin@xmath0 quantum particle can have a spin state connected to any direction of space .",

    "the second stern - gerlach apparatus is placed in direction of space @xmath61 and performs the experiment @xmath87 . we can then measure the relative frequency of particles being deflected  up \" for example .",
    "the statistical limit of this relative frequency is the probability that a particle will be deflected upwards .",

    "indeed we just have to identify the state @xmath59 of the quantum machine entity with the state @xmath90 of the spin , and the experiment @xmath66 of the quantum machine with the experiment @xmath87 of the spin for all directions of space @xmath61 and @xmath5 .",
    "then we just have to compare the transition probabilities for the quantum machine derived in formula s [ transqm01 ] and [ transqm02 ] with the ones measured in the laboratory for the stern - gerlach experiment .",
    "let us show in the next section that the standard quantum mechanical calculation leads to the same transition probabilities .",
    "we will now explicitly introduce the quantum mechanical description of the spin of a spin@xmath0 quantum particle . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "quantum mechanics makes a very abstract use of the vector space structure for the description of the states of the quantum entities .",
    "even the case of the simplest quantum model , the one we are presenting , the quantum description is rather abstract as will become obvious in the following . as we have mentioned in the introduction",
    ", it is the abstract nature of the quantum description that is partly at the origin of the many conceptual difficulties concerning quantum mechanics . for this reason we will introduce again quantum mechanics step by step .",
    "quantum mechanics describes the different spin states @xmath96 for different directions of space @xmath61 by the unit vectors of a two dimensional complex vector space , which we will denote by @xmath97 .",
    "this means that the spin states are not described by unit vectors in a three dimensional real space , as it is the case for our quantum machine model , but by unit vectors in a two dimensional complex space .",
    "this switch from a three dimensional real space to a two dimensional complex space lies at the origin of many of the mysterious aspects of quantum mechanics .",
    "it also touches some deep mathematical corresondences ( the relation between su(2 ) and so(3 ) for example ) of which the physical content has not yet been completely unraveled .",
    "before we completely treat the spin states , let us give an elementary description of @xmath97 itself .    _",
    "i ) the vector space @xmath97 _    @xmath97 is a two - dimensional vector space over the field of the complex numbers .",
    "this means that each vector of @xmath97 - in its cartesian representation - is of the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are complex numbers .",
    "the addition of vectors and the multiplication of a vector with a complex number are defined as follows : for @xmath101 and for @xmath102 we have : @xmath103 there exists an inproduct on @xmath97 : for @xmath101 we have : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the complex conjugation in @xmath106 .",
    "we remark that @xmath107 is linear in the second variable and conjugate linear in the first variable .",
    "more explicitly this means that for @xmath108 and @xmath109 we have : @xmath110    the inproduct defines the ` length ' or better ` norm ' of a vector @xmath111 as : @xmath112 and it also defines an orthogonality relation on the vectors of @xmath97 : we say that two vectors @xmath113 are orthogonal and write @xmath114 iff : @xmath115 a unit vector in @xmath97 is a vector with norm equal to @xmath27 .",
    "since the spin states are represented by these unit vectors we introduce a special symbol @xmath116 to indicate the set of unit vectors of @xmath97 . hence : @xmath117 the vector space has the cartesian orthonormal base formed by the vectors @xmath118 and @xmath119",
    "because we can obviously write each vector @xmath98 in the following way : @xmath120 _ ii ) the quantum representation of the spin states _ let us now make explicit the quantum mechanical representation of the spin states .",
    "the state @xmath90 of the spin of a spin@xmath0 quantum particle in direction @xmath5 is represented by the unit vector @xmath121 of @xmath116 : @xmath122 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the spherical coordinates of the unit vector @xmath5 .",
    "it is easy to verify that these are unit vectors in @xmath97 . indeed ,",
    "@xmath123 it is also easy to verify that two quantum states that correspond to opposite vectors @xmath124 and @xmath125 are orthogonal .",
    "indeed , a calculation shows @xmath126 this gives us the complete quantum mechanical description of the spin states of the spin of a spin@xmath0 quantum particle .",
    "we now have to explain how the spin experiments are described in the quantum formalism .",
    "as we explained already in detail , a spin experiment @xmath87 in the laboratory is executed by means of a stern - gerlach apparatus .",
    "to describe these experiments quantum mechanically we have to introduce somewhat more advanced mathematics , although still easy to master for those readers who have had no problems till now .",
    "so we encourage them to keep with us .    _",
    "i ) projection operators _    the first concept that we have to introduce for the description of the experiments is that of an operator or matrix . we only have to explain the case we are interested in , namely the case of the two dimensional complex vector space that describes the states of the spin of a spin@xmath0 quantum particle . in this case an operator or matrix @xmath127 consists of four complex numbers @xmath128 that have a well defined operation on the vectors of @xmath97 : for @xmath129 we have @xmath130 where @xmath131 it is easily verified that this operation is linear , which means that for @xmath132 and @xmath133 we have : @xmath134 moreover it can be shown that every linear operation on the vectors of @xmath97 is represented by a matrix . there is a unit operator @xmath135 and a zero operator @xmath3 that respectively maps each vector onto itself and on the zero vector @xmath136 : @xmath137 the sum of two operators @xmath138 and @xmath139 is defined as the operator @xmath140 such that @xmath141 and the product of these two operators is the operator @xmath142 such that @xmath143 we need some additional concepts and also a special set of operators to be able to explain how experiments are described in quantum mechanics .",
    "we say that a vector @xmath144 is an ` eigenvector ' of the operator @xmath127 iff for some @xmath145 we have : @xmath146 if @xmath98 is different from @xmath136 we say that @xmath147 is the eigenvalue of the operator @xmath127 corresponding to the eigenvector @xmath98 .",
    "let us introduce now the special type of operators that we need to explain how experiments are described by quantum mechanics .",
    "a projection operator @xmath4 is an operator such that @xmath148 and such that for @xmath132 we have : @xmath149 we remark that a projection operator , as we have defined it here , is sometimes called an orthogonal projection operator .",
    "let us denote the set of all projection operators by @xmath150 .",
    "if @xmath151 then also @xmath152 .",
    "indeed @xmath153 .",
    "we can show that the eigenvalues of a projection operator are @xmath3 or @xmath27 . indeed , suppose that @xmath102 is such an eigenvalue of @xmath4 with eigenvector @xmath154 .",
    "we then have @xmath155 . from this",
    "follows that @xmath156 and hence @xmath157 or @xmath158 .",
    "let us now investigate what the possible forms of projection operators are in our case @xmath97 .",
    "we consider the set @xmath159 for an arbitrary @xmath151 .",
    "\\i ) suppose that @xmath160 . then @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "this means that this situation is uniquely represented by the set @xmath163 .",
    "\\ii ) suppose that there exists an element @xmath164 such that @xmath165 .",
    "then @xmath166 which shows that @xmath167 is an eigenvector of @xmath4 with eigenvalue @xmath27 .",
    "further we also have that @xmath168 which shows that @xmath167 is an eigenvector of @xmath169 with eigenvalue @xmath3 . if we further supose that @xmath170 , then we have @xmath171 and the situation is represented by the set @xmath172 .",
    "\\iii ) let us now suppose that there exists a @xmath173 as in ii ) and an element @xmath174 such that @xmath175 .",
    "an analogous reasoning then shows that @xmath176 is an eigenvector of @xmath169 with eigenvalue @xmath27 and an eigenvector of @xmath4 with eigenvalue @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore we have : @xmath177 which shows that @xmath178 .",
    "this also proves that @xmath167 and @xmath176 form an orthogonal base of @xmath97 , and @xmath4 is in fact the projection on the one dimensional subspace generated by @xmath167 , while @xmath169 is the projection on the one dimensional subspace generated by @xmath176 .",
    "these three cases i ) , ii ) and iii ) cover all the possibilities , and we have now introduced all the elements necessary to explain how experiments are described in quantum mechanics .    _ ii ) the quantum representation of the measurements _    an experiment @xmath179 in quantum mechanics , with two possible outcomes @xmath64 and @xmath65 , in the case where the states are represented by the unit vectors of the two dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath97 , is represented by such a set @xmath159 of projection operators satisfying situation iii ) .",
    "this means that @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "let us state now the quantum rule that determines in which way the outcomes occur and what happens to the state under the influence of a measurement .",
    "if the state @xmath182 of the quantum entity is represented by a unit vector @xmath98 and the experiment @xmath179 by the set of non zero projection operators @xmath183 , then the outcome @xmath64 of @xmath179 occurs with a probability given by @xmath184 and if @xmath64 occurs the unit vector @xmath98 is changed into the unit vector latexmath:[\\[{p(z_1,z_2 ) \\over    after the experiment @xmath179 has been performed .",

    "we remark that we have : @xmath188 such that these numbers can indeed serve as probabilities for the respective outcomes , i.e. they add up to @xmath27 exhausting all other possibilities .",
    "_ iii ) the quantum representation of the spin experiments _",
    "let us now make explicit how quantum mechanics describes the spin experiments with a stern - gerlach apparatus in direction @xmath61 , hence the experiment @xmath87 .",
    "the projection operators that correspond to the spin measurement of the spin of a spin@xmath0 quantum particle in the @xmath61 direction are given by @xmath189 where @xmath190 where @xmath191 and hence @xmath192 and @xmath193 are the spherical coordinates angles of the vector @xmath61 .",
    "we can easily verify that @xmath194 let us calculate in this case the quantum probabilities .",

    "this is one of the reasons why it is so difficult to understand many of the aspects of quantum mechanics . since the quantum machine that we have presented also generates an isomorphic structure we have shown that , within our common reality , it is possible to realize this structure .",
    "the quantum machine is a model for the spin of a spin@xmath1 quantum particle and it is also a model for the abstract quantum description in the two dimensional complex vector space .",
    "this result will make it possible for us to analyse the hard quantum problems and to propose new solutions to these problems .",

    "it is just a description of our lack of knowledge about what precisely happens .",
    "since we do not know what really happens during the trajectory of the dice and its landing and since we also do not know this for all repeated experiments we will make , for reasons of symmetry , there is an equal chance for each side to be up after the dice stopped moving .",
    "probability of @xmath215 for each event expresses this type of lack of knowledge .",
    "philosophers say in this case that the probability is ` epistemic ' .",
    "probability that finds its origin in nature itself and not in our lack of knowledge about what really happens is called ` ontologic ' .    before the advent of quantum mechanics there was no important debate about the nature of the probabilities encountered in the physical world .",
    "it was commonly accepted that probabilities are epistemic and hence can be explained as due to our lack of knowledge about what really happens .",
    "it is this type of probability - the one encountered in classical physics - that was axiomatized by kolmogorov and therefore it is commonly believed that kolmogorovian probabilities are epistemic .",
    "it was rather a shock when physicists found out that the structure of the probability model that is encountered in quantum mechanics does not satisfy the axioms of kolmogorov .",
    "would this mean that quantum probabilities are ontologic ?",
    "anyhow it could only mean two things : ( 1 ) the quantum probabilities are ontologic , or ( 2 ) the axiomatic system of kolmogorov does not describe all types of epistemic probabilities . in this second case",
    "quantum probabilities could still be epistemic .",
    "most of investigations that physicist , mathematicians and philosophers carried out regarding the nature of the quantum probabilities pointed in the direction of ontologic probabilities .",
    "indeed , a whole area of research was born specifically with the aim of investigating this problem , it was called ` hidden variable theory research ' .",
    "the reason for this naming is the following : if the quantum probabilities are merely epistemic , it must be possible to build models with ` hidden variables ' , their prior absence causing the probabilistic description . these models must be able to substitute the quantum models , i.e. they are equivalent , and they entail explicitly epistemic probabilities , in the sense that a randomisation over the hidden variables gives rise to the quantum probabilities .    actually physicists trying to construct such hidden variable models had thermodynamics in mind .",
    "the theory of thermodynamics is independent of classical mechanics , and has its own set of physical quantities such as pressure , volume , temperature , energy and entropy and its own set of states .",
    "it was , however , possible to introduce an underlying theory of classical mechanics .",
    "to do so , one assumes that every thermodynamic entity consists of a large number of molecules and the real pure state of the entity is determined by the positions and momenta of all these molecules .",
    "a thermodynamic state of the entity is then a mixture or mixed state of the underlying theory .",
    "the programme had been found feasible and it was a great success to derive the laws of thermodynamics in this way from newtonian mechanics .",
    "is it possible to do something similar for quantum mechanics ?",
    "is it possible to introduce extra variables into quantum mechanics such that these variables define new states , and the description of the entity based on these new states is classical",
    "? moreover would quantum mechanics be the statistical theory that results by averaging over these variables ? this is what scientists working on hidden variable theories were looking for .",
    "john von neumann gave the first proof of the impossibility of hidden variables for quantum mechanics [ 1 ] .",
    "one of the assumptions that von neumann made in his proof is that the expectation value of a linear combination of physical quantities is the linear combination of the expectation values of the physical quantities . as remarked by john bell",
    "[ 11 ] , this assumption is not justified for non compatible physical quantities , such that , indeed , von neumann s proof can not be considered conclusive .",
    "bell constructs in the same reference a hidden variable model for the spin of a spin@xmath0 quantum particle , and shows that indeed von neumann s assumption is not satisfied in his model .",
    "bell also criticizes in his paper two other proofs of the nonexistence of hidden variables , namely the proof by jauch and piron [ 12 ] and the proof by gleason [ 13 ] .",
    "bell correctly points out the danger of demanding extra assumptions to be satisfied without knowing exactly what these assumptions mean physically .",
    "the extra mathematical assumptions , criticized by bell , were introduced in all these approaches to express the physical idea that it must be possible to find , in the hidden variable description , the original physical quantities and their basic algebra .",
    "this physical idea was most delicately expressed , without extra mathematical assumptions , and used in the impossibility proof of kochen and specker [ 14 ] .",
    "gudder [ 15 ] gave an impossibility proof along the same lines as the one of jauch and piron , but now carefully avoiding the assumptions criticized by bell .",
    "one could conclude by stating that every one of these impossibility proofs consists of showing that a hidden variable theory gives rise to a certain mathematical structure for the physical quantities ( see [ 1 ] , [ 13 ] and [ 14 ] ) or for the properties ( see [ 12 ] and [ 15 ] ) of the physical entity under consideration .",
    "the physical quantities and the properties of a quantum mechanical entity do not fit into this structure and therefore it is impossible to replace quantum mechanics by a hidden variable theory .    more recently",
    "this structural difference between classical entities and quantum entities has been studied by accardi within the category of the probability models itself [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .",
    "accardi explicitly defines the concept of kolmogorovian probability model starting from the concept of conditional probability .",
    "he identifies bayes axiom as the one that , if it is satisfied , renders the probability model kolmogorovian , i.e. classical . again",
    "this approach of probability shows the fundamental difference between a classical theory and a quantum theory .    a lot of physicists , once aware of this fundamental structural difference between classical and quantum theories , gave up hope that it would ever be possible to replace quantum mechanics by a hidden variable theory",
    "; and we admit to have been among them .",
    "meanwhile it has become clear that the state of affairs is more complicated .",
    "years ago we managed to built a macroscopic classical entity that violates the bell inequalities [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] and [ 20 ] .",
    "about the same time accardi had shown that bell inequalities are equivalent to his inequalities characterizing a kolmogorovian probability model .",
    "this meant that the example we had constructed to violate bell inequalities should also violate accardi s inequalities characterizing a kolmogorovian probability model , which indeed proved to be the case .",
    "but this meant that we had given an example of a macroscopic ` classical ' entity having a non kolmogorovian probability model .",
    "this was very amazing and the classification made by many physicists of a micro world described by quantum mechanics and a macro world described by classical physics was challenged .",
    "the macroscopic entity with a non kolmogorovian probability model was first published in [ 7 ] and refined in [ 8 ] , but essentially it is the quantum machine that we have presented again in this paper .",
    "we were able to show at that time the state of affairs to be the following .",
    "if we have a physical entity @xmath216 and we have a lack of knowledge about the state @xmath182 of the physical entity @xmath216 , then a theory describing this situation is necessarily a classical statistical theory with a kolmogorovian probability model . if we have a physical entity @xmath216 and a lack of knowledge about the measurement @xmath179 to be performed on the physical entity @xmath216 , and to be changing the state of the entity @xmath216 , then we can not describe this situation by a classical statistical theory , because the probability model that arises is non kolmogorovian .",
    "hence , lack of knowledge about measurements , that change the state of the entity under study , gives rise to a non kolmogorovian probability model .",
    "what do we mean by ` lack of knowledge about the measurement @xmath179 ' ?",
    "well , we mean that the measurement @xmath179 is in fact not a ` pure ' measurement , in the sense that there are hidden properties of the measurement , such that the performance of @xmath179 introduces the performance of a ` hidden ' measurement , denoted @xmath217 , with the same set of outcomes as the measurement @xmath179 .",
    "the measurement @xmath179 consists then in fact of choosing one way or another between one of the hidden measurements @xmath217 and then performing the chosen measurement @xmath217 .",
    "we can very easily see how these hidden measurements appear in the quantum machine .",
    "indeed , if we call the measurement @xmath218 the measurement that consists in performing @xmath66 and such that the elastic breaks in the point @xmath219 for some @xmath220 $ ] , then , each time @xmath66 is performed , it is actually one of the @xmath218 that takes place .",
    "we do not control this , in the sense that the @xmath218 are really ` hidden measurements ' that we can not choose to perform .",
    "the probability @xmath81 that the experiment @xmath66 gives the outcome @xmath64 if the entity is in state @xmath59 is a randomasation over the different situations where the hidden measurements @xmath221 gives the outcome @xmath64 with the entity in state @xmath59 .",
    "this is exactly the way we have calculated this probability in section  [ secprob ] .",
    "first of all we have to mention that it is possible to construct a ` quantum machine ' model for an arbitrary quantum mechanical entity .",
    "this means that the ` hidden measurement ' explanation can be adopted generally , explaining also the origin of the quantum probabilities for a general quantum entity .",
    "we refer to [ 8 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] and [ 24 ] for a demonstration of the fact that every quantum mechanical entity can be represented by a hidden measurement model .",
    "what is now the consequence of this for the explanation of the quantum probabilities ?",
    "it proves that quantum probability is epistemic , and hence conceptually no ontologic probability has to be introduced to account for it .",
    "the quantum probability however finds its origin in the lack of knowledge that we have about the interaction between the measurement and the physical entity . in this sense",
    "it is a type of probability that is non - classical and does not appear in the classical statistical theories .",
    "quantum mechanical states are pure states and descriptions of the reality of the quantum entity .",
    "this means that the ` hidden variable ' theories which try to make quantum theory into a classical statistical theory are doomed to fail , as the mentioned no - go theorems for hidden variable theories had proven already without explaining why .",
    "our approach allows to understand why .",
    "indeed , there is another type of epistemic probability than the one identified in the classical statistical theories , namely the probability due to a lack of knowledge on the interaction between the measurement and the physical entity under study .",
    "it is natural that this new type of epistemic probability can not be eliminated from a theory that describes the reality of the physical entity , because it appears when one incorporates the experiments related to the measurements of the properties of the physical entity in question .",
    "therefore it is also natural that it remains present in the physical theory describing the reality of the physical entity , but it has no ontologic nature .",
    "this means that , with the explanation of the quantum probabilities put forward here , quantum mechanics does not contradict determinism for the whole of reality .",
    "if we demand for the quantum machine that the elastic can break at everyone of its points , and the breaking of a piece is such that it is proportional to the length of this piece , then this hypothesis fixes the possible ` amount ' of lack of knowledge about the interaction between the experimental apparatus and the physical entity .",
    "indeed , only certain type of elastic can be used to perform the experiments . on the other hand",
    ", we can easily imagine elastic that break according to different laws depending on their physical construction .",
    "let us introduce the following different kinds of elastics : at one extremity we consider elastics that can break in everyone of its points and such that the breaking of a piece is proportional to the length of this piece .",
    "these are the ones we have already considered , and since they lead to a pure quantum structure , we call them quantum elastics . at the other extremity ,",
    "we consider a type of elastic that can only break in one point , and let us suppose , for the sake of simplicity , that this point is the middle of the elastic ( in [ 5 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] and [ 27 ] the general situation is treated ) .",
    "this kind of elastic is far from elastic , but since it is an extreme type of real elastics , we stillgive it that name",
    ". we shall show that if experiments are performed with this class of elastic , the resulting structures are classical , and therefore we will call them classical elastics . for the general case ,",
    "we want to consider a class of elastics that can only break in a segment of length @xmath222 around the center of the elastic .",

    "if @xmath230 , and for the experiment @xmath66 only quantum elastics are used , the lack of knowledge is maximal , because the chosen elastic can break at any of its points . in fig 12",
    "we have represented a typical situation of an experiment with an @xmath223-elastic , where the elastic can only break between the points @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",

    "as we will see , these additional elements are the so called ` non - product states ' .      for standard quantum mechanics the compound entity @xmath216 consisting of two entities @xmath570 and @xmath571 is described by means of the tensor product @xmath638 of the hilbert spaces @xmath639 and @xmath640",
    "that describe the two sub - entities @xmath570 and @xmath571 .",
    "we have studied this situation in detail in earlier work [ 51 ] , and will here only expose the scheme .",
    "let us consider an entity @xmath216 described with a state property space @xmath543 corresponding to the hilbert space @xmath487 consisting of two entities @xmath570 and @xmath571 described by state property spaces @xmath641 and @xmath573 corresponding to hilbert space @xmath642 and @xmath640 .",
    "let us first identify the functions @xmath643 and @xmath644 that describe the situation where @xmath216 is the joint entity of @xmath570 and @xmath571 .",
    "for the function @xmath644 this identification is straightforward .",
    "we have : @xmath645 this shows that for standard quantum mechanics , as in the case where we would describe the compound entity by means of the co - product , for each property @xmath590 of @xmath570 ( @xmath646 of @xmath571 ) there is a unique property @xmath592 ( @xmath647 ) of @xmath216 . the requirement that with each state @xmath182 of the compound entity @xmath216 correspond unique states @xmath584 and @xmath585 of the sub - entities gives rise to a special situation in the case that @xmath182 corresponds to a non - product vector of the hilbert space @xmath648 , i.e. a vector @xmath649 that can not be reduced to a product of a vector in @xmath642 and a vector in @xmath640 .",
    "it can be shown that , taking into account the covariance requirement - this time also for the probalitities - there do correspond two unique states @xmath650 and @xmath651 to such a state @xmath652 , but when @xmath505 is a non - product vector , @xmath653 and @xmath654 are density operators that do not correspond to vectors in @xmath642 and @xmath640 .",
    "this means ( see theorem [ densatom ] ) that @xmath650 and @xmath651 are non atomic states although @xmath652 is an atomic state .",
    "we have not stated this too explicit till now , but in standard quantum mechanics there is a real physical difference between the atomic states - represented by density operators corresponding to a vector - and the non atomic states - represented by density operators not corresponding to a vector .",
    "the atomic states are ` pure states ' and the non atomic states are ` mixed states ' .",
    "this is in fact also the case in our operational definition of the join states in ( see definition [ productteststate ] ) .",
    "the join state of a set of states , as defined there is a mixture of these states , which means that the entity is in the join state of this set iff it is in one of the states of this set , but we lack the knowledge about which one .",
    "so we repeat : a mixed state of a set of pure states describes our lack of knowledge about the pure state where the entity is in .",
    "if this is the meaning of a non atomic state , hence a mixed state over some set of atomic states , as it is the case in standard quantum mechanics , we can conclude that the entity is always in an atomic state .",
    "the non atomic states only describe our lack of knowledge about the atomic state the entity exactly is in .",
    "we can now see where the fundamental problem arises with the tensor product coupling procedure of quantum mechanics .",
    "if entities are always in atomic states , and since for an atomic state of the compound entity that corresponds to a non - product vector of the tensor product hilbert space , the component states are strictly non atomic , it would indicate that the sub - entities are not in a state .",
    "this is of course very strange .",
    "indeed , it seems even contradictory with the concept of state itself .",
    "an entity must always be in a state ( and hence a quantum entity always in an atomic state ) , whether it is a sub - entity of another entity or not .",
    "as we have mentioned already , these non - product states also give rise to epr type correlations between the two sub - entities @xmath570 and @xmath571 .",
    "we remark that the presence of these correlations also indicates that the quantum description of the compound entity is not a description of ` separated ' entities .",
    "so something really profoundly mysterious occurs here .",
    "we also mention that it is excluded that the non - product states of the quantum compound entity would be mathematical artifacts of the theory , since entities are without many problems prepared in these non - product states in the laboratory these days .",
    "so the non - product states exists and are real states of the compound entity consisting of two quantum entities .",
    "should we then decide that the sub - entities have disappeared as entities , and only some properties are left ?",
    "we want to reflect more about this question and investigate what the possibilities are .",
    "most of all we want to put forward an alternative possibility , that is however speculative , but should be worth further investigation .",
    "we have to remark that the problem that we explained in the foregoing section was known from the early days of quantum mechanics but concealed more or less by the confusion that often exists between pure states and mixtures .",
    "let us explain this first .",
    "the reality of a quantum entity in standard quantum mechanics is represented by a pure state , namely a ray of the corresponding hilbert space .",
    "mixed states are represented in standard quantum mechanics by density operators ( positive self adjoint operators with trace equal to 1 ) .",
    "but although a mixed state is also called a state , it does not represent the reality of the entity under consideration , but a lack of knowledge about this reality .",
    "this means that if the entity is in a mixed state , it is actually in a pure state , and the mixed state just describes the lack of knowledge that we have about the pure state it is in .",
    "we have remarked that the deep conceptual problem that we indicate here was noticed already in the early days of quantum mechanics , but disguised by the existence of the two types of states , pure states and mixed states .",
    "indeed in most books on quantum mechanics it is mentioned that for the description of sub - entities by means of the tensor product procedure it is so that the compound entity can be in a pure state ( and a non - product state is meant here ) such that the sub - entities will be in mixed states and not in pure states ( see for example [ 52 ] 11 - 8 and [ 53 ] p 306 ) .",
    "the fact that the sub - entities , although they are not in a pure state , are at least in a mixed state , seems at first sight to be some kind of a solution to the conceptual problem that we indicated in the foregoing section .",
    "although a little further reflection shows that it is not : indeed , if a sub - entity is in a mixed state , it should anyhow be in a pure state , and this mixed state should just describe our lack of knowledge about this pure state .",
    "so the problem is not solved at all . probably because quantum mechanics is anyhow entailed with a lot of paradoxes and mysteries ,",
    "the problem was just added to the list by the majority of physicists .    way back , in a paper published in 1984 ,",
    "we have already shown that in a more general approach we can define pure states for the sub - entities , but they will not be ` atoms ' of the lattice of properties [ 50 ] . as we have shown already the ray states of quantum mechanics",
    "give rise to atoms of the property lattice , such that ` pure states ' in quantum mechanics correspond to ` atomic ' states of the state property space .",
    "this means that the non atomic pure states that we have identified in [ 50 ] can anyhow not be represented within the standard quantum mechanical formalism .",
    "we must admit that the finding of the existence of non atomic pure states in the 1984 paper , even from the point of view of generalized quantum formalisms , seemed also to us very far reaching and difficult to interpret physically .",
    "indeed intuitively it seems to be so that only atomic states should represent pure states .",
    "we know now that this is a wrong intuition .",
    "but to explain why we have to present first the other pieces of the puzzle .    a second piece of the puzzle appeared when in 1990 we built a model of a mechanistic classical laboratory situation violating bell inequalities with @xmath655 , exactly ` in the same way ' as its violations by the epr experiments [ 54 ] . with this model we tried to show that bell inequalities can be violated in the macroscopic world with the same numerical value as the quantum violation",
    "what is interesting for the problem of the description of sub - entities is that new ` pure ' states were introduced in this model .",
    "we will see in a moment that the possibility of existence of these new states lead to a possible solution of the problem of the description of sub - entities within a hilbert space setting , but different from standard quantum mechanics .",
    "more pieces of the puzzle appeared steadily during the elaboration of the general formalism presented in [ 6 ] .",
    "we started to work on this formalism during the first half of the eighties , reformulating and elaborating some of the concepts during these years .",
    "then it became clear that the new states introduced in [ 54 ] , although ` pure ' states in the model , appear as non atomic states in the general formalism .",
    "this made us understand that the first intuition that classified non atomic states as bad candidates for pure states was a wrong intuition .",
    "let us present now the total scheme of our possible solution .    in the example that we proposed in [ 54 ] we used two spin models as the one presented here ( the quantum machine ) and introduced new states on both models with the aim of presenting a situation that violates the bell inequalities exactly as in the case of the singlet spin state of two coupled spin@xmath0 particles do .",
    "we indeed introduced a state for both spin models that corresponds to the point in the center of each sphere , and connecting these two states by a rigid rod we could generate a violation of bell s inequalities .",
    "we have shown in the last part of section [ complquant ] that the centre of @xmath57 is a non atomic state of the quantum machine .",
    "this means that we have ` identified ' a possible ` non - mixture ' state ( meaning with ` non - mixture ' that it really represents the reality of the entity and not a lack of knowledge about this reality ) that is not an atom of the pre - ordered set of states .",
    "is this a candidate for the ` non - mixed ' states that we identified in [ 50 ] and that were non - atoms ?",
    "it is indeed , as we prove explicitly in [ 6 ] .",
    "the states @xmath413 , where @xmath414 and @xmath483 , as defined in [ complquant ] , and that are certainly pure states for the quantum machine entity , are represented by the density operator @xmath444 if we use formula  [ probcal ] for the calculation of the transition probabilities .",
    "the idea that we want to put forward is the following : perhaps density operators just do represent pure states , also for a quantum entity . such that the set of pure states would be represented by the set of density operators and not by the set of rays of the hilbert space . if this would be the case , the conceptual problem of using the tensor product would partly be solved .",
    "we admit immediately that it is a very speculative idea that we put forward here .",
    "the problem is also that it will be difficult to test it experimentally on one physical entity .",
    "indeed , the so called new pure states , corresponding to density operators of the hilbert space , can not experimentally be distinguished from mixtures of old pure states , corresponding to vectors , and represented also by these density operators .",
    "it is an easy mathematical result since in all probability calculations only the density operator appears .",
    "we can also see it explicitly on the quantum machine .",
    "let us go back to the calculation that we made in the second part of section [ complquant ] .",
    "the ` pure ' state @xmath413 corresponding to an interior point @xmath656 of @xmath57 is represented by the density operator @xmath439 but this density operator represents also the ` mixed ' state describing the following situation of lack of knowledge : the point is in one of the pure states @xmath59 or @xmath657 with weight @xmath435 and @xmath436 respectively .",
    "although this mixed state and the pure state @xmath413 are ontologically very different states , they can not experimentally be distinguished by means of the elastic experiments .",
    "we have called section [ failingaxioms ] ` paradoxes and failing axioms ' . indeed a possible conclusion for the result that we have exposed in this section is that the covering law ( and some of the other axioms ) are just no good and that we should look for a more general formalism than standard quantum mechanics .",
    "we are more and more convinced that this must be the case , also because it is again the covering law that makes it impossible to describe a continuous change from quantum to classical passing through the intermediate situations that we have mentioned in section [ intermediate ] ( see [ 5 ] , [ 25 ] and [ 27 ] and the paper of thomas durt in this book ) .",
    "in this sense we want to come back now to the suggestive idea that was proposed in the introduction .",
    "the idea of relativity theory , to take the points of space - time as representing the events of reality , goes back to a long tradition .",
    "it was euclid who for the first time synthesised the descriptions that the greek knew about the properties of space by using as basic concepts points , lines and planes .",
    "let us remember that euclid constructed an axiomatic system consisting of five axioms - now called euclid s axioms - for euclidean space and its geometric structure .",
    "all classical physical theories have later , without hesitation , taken the euclidean space as theatre for reality . from a purely axiomatic point of view there has been a long and historic discussion about the independence of the fifth euclidean axiom .",
    "some scientists have pretended to be able to derive it from the four other axioms .",
    "the problem was resolved in favour of the independence by gauss , bolyai and lobachevski by constructing explicit models of non - euclidean geometries .",
    "felix klein proposed a classification along three fundamental types : an elliptic geometry , the one originally proposed by gauss , the geometry of the surface of a sphere for example , a hyperbolic geometry , proposed by lobachevski , the geometry of the surface of a saddle for example , and a parabolic geometry , that lies in between both .",
    "it was riemann who proposed a complete theory of non - euclidean geometries , the geometry of curved space , that was later used by einstein to formulate general relativity theory .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the programme of general relativity - to introduce the force fields of physics as properties of the metric of space - was already put forward explicitly by riemann .",
    "he could however not have found the solution of general relativity because he was looking for a solution in three dimensional space , and general relativity has to be constructed in four dimensional space - time . in the formulation of einstein ,",
    "which is the one of riemann applied to the four dimensional space - time continuum , the events are represented by the points and the metric tensor describes the nature of the geometry .",
    "let us now see whether we can find an analogy with our analysis of quantum mechanics by means of our axiomatic approach . here",
    "the basic concepts are states , properties and probability . in geometry",
    "a set of points forms a space . in quantum mechanics",
    "the set of states and properties form a state property space .",
    "just like the euclidean space is not just any space , the state property space of quantum mechanics is not just any state property space",
    ". we have outlined @xmath658 axioms that make an arbitrary state property space into a quantum mechanical state property space .",
    "we have remarked already that the purpose of quantum axiomatics was not to change standard quantum mechanics , exactly as the purpose of euclid was certainly not to formulate an alternative geometry : he wanted to construct an operational theory about the structure of space .",
    "the operational axiomatization of quantum theory has taken a long time , the axiom of ` plane transitivity ' relies on a result of maria pia soler of 1995 [ 48 ] .",
    "since however the general problems related to axiomatization are nowadays better known , there has been little discussion about the independence of the axioms .",
    "but the physical meaning of certain axioms ( e.g. the failing covering law ) remained obscure .",
    "these were merely axioms introduced to recover the complete hilbert space structure which includes the linearity of the state space . within this development of the axiomatic structure of quantum theory",
    "it has been shown now that the compound entity of two separated quantum entities can not be described .",
    "the axiom that makes such a description impossible is the covering law , equivalent to the linearity of the state space .",
    "do we have to work out a general quantum theory , not necessarily satisfying the covering law , as riemann has given us a general theory of space ?",
    "we believe so , but we know that a lot of work has to be done . in [ 6 ] a humble general scheme is put forward that may be a start for the elaboration of such a general quantum theory .",
    "i want to thank jan broekaert and bart van steirteghem to read and discuss with me parts of the text of this article .",
    "their remarks and suggestions have been of great value .",
