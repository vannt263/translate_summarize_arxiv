    "many heavy electron materials show knight shift anomalies , which are a deviation from a linear relation of the knight shift @xmath16 to the magnetic susceptibility @xmath1 below the kondo temperature @xmath3 . the origin of the knight shift anomalies has been a subject of great interest in the condensed matter community over a period of nearly twenty five years  @xcite .",
    "if the impurities in metals have local magnetic moments , they display interesting properties comparing to metals with nonmagnetic impurities , such as a resistivity minimum and anomalies in specific heat and susceptibility .",
    "this kondo effect is a consequence of interaction between the magnetic ion and conduction electron .",
    "the central physical concept is that the many body screening cloud surrounding a kondo impurity site should give rise to an anomalous temperature dependent knight shift at nuclear sites due to the coupling of the local moment to the nuclear spin through the screening cloud  @xcite .",
    "such a `` non - linear knight shift anomaly '' is to be distinguished from the non - linear susceptibility related to the field dependence of @xmath6 .",
    "another way to describe this effect is to say that in the absence of an anomaly , the contribution @xmath17 from a local moment at distance @xmath18 from the nucleus can be written as @xmath19 .",
    "this factorization does not hold if there is an     + anomaly ( instead @xmath20 due to the temperature dependent polarization cloud ) .",
    "after heeger  @xcite suggested that the anomalous spin cloud was detected at low temperatures , the central question has been whether a conduction electron spin cloud with huge coherence length @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the fermi velocity and @xmath3 is the kondo temperature exists .",
    "the main motivation of this paper is to help clear up this conflict .",
    "the knight shift calculations presented here are the first performed using a realistic impurity model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ review.sec ] , the kondo effect and the knight shift anomaly in heavy electron materials will be reviewed .",
    "first , general characteristics of the kondo effect are discussed .",
    "we will then review the history of knight shift anomalies in heavy electron systems . in sec .",
    "[ model.sec ] , the model hamiltonian is introduced for both ce and u compound . also we review the methods we have used to evaluate the knight shift ( the non crossing approximation(nca ) and average - t matrix approximation ( ata ) )",
    ". our formalisms for numerical calculations are explained , and a detailed derivation of the knight shift feynman diagram will be given in the appendices . in the next section ,",
    "the numerical results for ce and yb ions which are single channel kondo materials and for u ions in a proposed quadrupolar kondo alloy will be examined and compared with the experimental results .",
    "the calculated nmr knight shift of ce and yb compounds show low temperature anomalies and agree well with the experimental results .",
    "but , there is no calculated knight shift anomaly for the proposed quadrupolar kondo u compound , in contrast to experiment .",
    "the last section includes conclusions and directions for future work .",
    "the existence of localized moments in dilute alloys that couple to conduction electrons has important consequences for the electrical properties .",
    "it has been known since 1930@xcite that the resistivity has a rather shallow minimum occurring at a low temperature that depends weakly on the concentration of magnetic impurities instead of dropping monotonically with decreasing temperature like metals with nonmagnetic impurities . in 1963",
    ", kondo  @xcite explained that this minimum arises from some unexpected features of the scattering of conduction electrons off a local magnetic moment , with the simplified model hamiltonian @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the annihilation operator of the conduction electron , @xmath25 is the spin index , @xmath26 are pauli matrices , @xmath27 is the spin operator of the impurity , and @xmath28 is the exchange coupling .",
    "kondo discovered that the magnetic scattering cross section is divergent in perturbation theory .",
    "the anomalously high scattering probability of magnetic ions at low temperatures is a consequence of the dynamic nature of the scattering induced by the exchange coupling and the sharpness of the fermi surface at low temperatures .",
    "subsequent analysis by kondo and others has shown that a nonperturbative treatment removes the divergence , yielding instead a term in the impurity contribution to the resistivity that increases with decreasing temperature . in spite of the simple model hamiltonian , a magnetic @xmath29 local moment interacting with the conduction electron gas ,",
    "this result is an indication that the problem is explicitly a many body problem , meaning that the electron in state @xmath30 which is being scattered is sensitive to the occupation of all other electron states @xmath31 .    for this single channel kondo model ,",
    "there is only one characteristic energy scale , the kondo temperature @xmath3 , provided that the temperature @xmath32 is much smaller than the conduction electron bandwidth @xmath33 , and corrections of order @xmath34 are neglected .",
    "the kondo temperature is given by @xmath35^{1/2}exp(-1/n(0)j),\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the conduction electron density of states at the fermi level .",
    "any physical quantities are universal functions of @xmath37 . at low temperature , with all material properties buried in @xmath3 .",
    "this kondo model can explain the anomalies in the transport coefficients , specific heat and magnetic susceptibility for some alloys with magnetic impurities .",
    "the kondo effect is characterized by the development of the kondo resonance peak with width of order of @xmath3 . at high temperatures",
    "@xmath38 , the impurity resistivity increases logarithmically as the temperature decreases , and saturates to a finite value at low temperatures below @xmath39 .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility has a curie - weiss form at high temperatures and shows pauli paramagnetism at low temperatures with @xmath40,concomitantly @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath6 behavior is explained by the fact that the magnetic moments which exist at high temperatures are screened out by the conduction electron spin clouds at low temperatures with the formation of a singlet ground state .",
    "this conduction spin cloud and the knight shift anomaly will be discussed more in the next subsection .",
    "there have been many theoretical and experimental works about the knight shift anomaly for the heavy electron materials .",
    "whether there is an observable conduction electron spin cloud with huge coherence length has been an issue in condensed matter physics more than 25 years and this is our main motivation to carry out this paper .    in the simplest approximation ,",
    "the added electron is bound into a singlet with the impurity  @xcite .",
    "because of the falloff the amplitude of wave function with the energy @xmath42 , only states within roughly @xmath43 of the fermi surface are involved in the singlet . as a result , in coordinate space , the singlet wave function extends to a very large distance of order @xmath44 .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite calculated the susceptibility at @xmath45 using the appelbaum - kondo theory  @xcite and found @xmath46 where @xmath47 \\label{eq : chi2}\\ ] ] equations ( [ eq : chi1 ] ) and ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) give the very interesting result that one half the excess susceptibility is localized on the impurity site ( @xmath48 ) and one - half is associated with the partially polarized quasi particle(@xmath49 ) .",
    "the associated spin polarization around the partially magnetized impurity is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the uniform polarization due to the external field , @xmath52 is the usual rkky term  @xcite which @xmath7 dependence is given by @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the quasiparticle term with @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "this expression is valid for @xmath57 , and at greater distances @xmath58 rapidly approaches zero . in both the rkky term and @xmath58 term",
    "the value @xmath59 is not the free spin value but is determined by the local susceptibility @xmath60 .",
    "the existence of the rkky term for @xmath61 was shown by suhl  @xcite .",
    "the technique of nuclear magnetic resonance has been of primary importance in the development of our current understanding of the localized moment problem .",
    "the reasons are twofold .",
    "first , the nuclei in the host metal in the vicinity of the impurity are sensitive to local perturbations in the spin density(via the hyperfine interaction ) and the charge density(via the nuclear quadrupolar interaction ) .",
    "moreover , the nuclei themselves are only weakly coupled to the electronic system and therefore act as passive `` spies '' into the phenomena of interest .",
    "secondly , the nuclear relaxation is sensitive to the low - lying excitations of the electronic system and consequently can provide information on the dynamical aspects of the impurity problem . for the most part nmr experiments in heavy electron compounds",
    "are carried out on the nuclei of the non-@xmath62 ions , so that coupling to the @xmath62 moments occurs via indirect interactions such as transferred hyperfine and dipolar fields .",
    "the nmr experiment of boyce and slichter  @xcite on fe impurities in cu metals showed no evidence for a knight shift anomaly at low temperature and was interpreted to indicate the absence of this screening cloud or at least a screening cloud of size of the order of a lattice spacing .",
    "these mixed results have led to theoretical discussions about the size of any screening conduction electron spin cloud or even whether it exist  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , pronounced knight shift anomalies have been observed in the concentrated heavy electron materials cesn@xmath9@xcite and ybcual@xcite , which have been described as kondo lattice systems with @xmath63 . in view of the boyce - slichter result",
    ", the question is raised whether these anomalies represent a coherent effect of the periodic lattice rather than a single ion effect .",
    "however , recent experiments on the proposed quadrupolar kondo alloy@xcite y@xmath64u@xmath65pd@xmath9 demonstrate that for concentrations of 0.1 - 0.2 there are pronounced non - linearities in the y knight shift for sufficiently large distances away from the u ion@xcite .",
    "ishii  @xcite calculated the field induced spin polarization for the degenerated anderson model and confirmed that an anomalous spin cloud is formed outside of the kondo screening length @xmath66 at @xmath67 .",

    "also , for the strong @xmath86 limit , spin polarization is calculated for @xmath87 .",
    "it is given by @xmath88 by the relation @xmath89",
    "@xcite , the above spin polarization is just the rkky contribution . comparing the equations ( [ br ] ) and ( [ sr ] ) ,",
    "the conduction electron spin cloud which is formed outside the kondo coherence length has the rkky form but with @xmath90 times bigger amplitude than the spin cloud inside the kondo coherence length .",
    "chen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite calculated the zero frequency response function @xmath91 around a magnetic impurity , using a perturbative thermodynamic scaling procedure and nonperturbative renomalization group method for @xmath92 kondo model .",
    "the host nuclei near magnetic impurities at positions @xmath18 displays satellite resonances in the tail of the main magnetic resonance signal , with a knight shift given by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the knight shift of the pure host .",
    "then @xmath95 is @xmath96 chen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that this knight shift is factorized into a product of temperature and spatial dependent functions , specifically @xmath97 where @xmath1 is the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the computed @xmath98 has the rkky form .",
    "the conduction electron spin polarization in the anderson model has been studied with the nca previously by w. pollwein _ et al . _",
    "however , this study was carried out only for the spin 1/2 model with infinite coulomb repulsion , and for a limited parameter regime ( only results for very low @xmath3 values and short distances @xmath99 have been numerically calculated ) . in consequence",
    ", no strong evidence was found for a knight shift anomaly in this previous work .",
    "recently , e. srensen and i. affleck  @xcite showed that the kondo coherence length @xmath21 , varies when temperature changes by combining a finite size scaling ansatz with density matrix renomalization group calculations .",
    "they write the scaling hypothesis for three dimensional susceptibility is @xmath100 where @xmath62 is a real universal scaling function .",
    "@xmath101 is the standard pauli bulk susceptibility with @xmath102 the density of states per spin . at higher temperatures",
    "@xmath103 , the local susceptibility shows rkky behavior and at lower temperatures @xmath39 it has a local fermi liquid form .",
    "so the knight shift has longer range at low temperatures where the conduction electron screening cloud has formed than at high temperatures where it has not .",
    "sorensen and affleck tried to explain the experiment by boyce and slichter  @xcite by the possible factorization of the scaling functions deep inside the screening cloud where the experiment was done .",
    "in our work , we use the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath81 single impurity anderson model  @xcite .",
    "the anderson model can be canonically transformed by the schrieffer - wolff transformation to the kondo model at @xmath81 limit  @xcite , and is a good model hamiltonian to describe heavy electron materials with @xmath62 electrons .",
    "schematics of this model are shown in fig  [ anderson.fig ] for ce ions .",
