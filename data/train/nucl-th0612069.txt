    "also a recent non - relativistic qm calculation of such charmonium - like states gives a vector charge radius that is larger than the pseudoscalar charge radius  @xcite .",

    "our numerical errors grow with increasing meson mass ( i.e. increasing quark mass ) , mainly because the momentum @xmath93 of the quark propagator in the bethe  salpeter integrals and in the triangle diagram spans an increasingly large domain in the complex @xmath93-plane with increasing meson mass . the analytic continuation of the solution of the quark dse , eq .",
    "( [ eq : quarkdse ] ) , from the spacelike ( euclidean ) axis to this complex momentum domain becomes numerically cumbersome and inaccurate for large meson masses . in our calculations",
    "this is reflected by the fact that for the charm quark we have an estimated 2% to 4% numerical uncertainty in the moments , and a numerical uncertainty of 6% to 8% in the radii .",
    "the magnetic moment @xmath94 turns out to be almost independent of the current quark mass , fig .",
    "[ fig : massdep ] . for @xmath95",
    "the magnetic moment increases with quark mass from @xmath96 to @xmath97 ; above @xmath98 the numerical uncertainty starts to increase and the magnetic moment is basically independent of the quark mass within our numerical error bars of a few percent .",
    "this mass dependence can naively be understood by considering a simple constituent quark model , in which a vector meson is a bound state of two quarks in an s - wave with the spins aligned . in such a model one",
    "expects the magnetic moment to be proportional to that of its constituents , i.e. @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the magnetic moment of the constituent quark .",
    "as long as the quark magnetic moment is only weakly dependent on the current quark mass , so is the magnetic moment of the bound state .    since both the charge , @xmath101 , and the magnetic moment , @xmath102 , are ( almost ) independent of the quark mass , one might expect that also the quadrupole moment , @xmath5 , depends only weakly on the quark mass .",
    "however , our calculation shows that this is not the case : the quadrupole moment @xmath103 decreases monotonically with @xmath104 , and is reduced by about 25% at @xmath105 . above this quark mass",
    ", the quadrupole moment continues to decrease with quark mass , but at a slower rate .",
    "the mass dependence of the quadrupole moment may not be that surprising on realizing that our results , @xmath106 depending on quark mass , deviate significantly from the canonical value , @xmath107 .",
    "furthermore , of all the static electromagnetic properties , the quadrupole moment shows the largest model dependence , see table  [ table : resultsrhokstar ] , indicating that the details of the dynamics are important for this quantity .    the fact that we find a nontrivial quadrupole moment for all quark masses , indicates that the naive picture of a vector meson as a nonrelativistic bound state of two quarks in an s - wave is too simple .",
    "clearly , there is a significant amount of quark orbital momentum in the vector mesons , which in our approach is incorporated in the meson bsas .",
    "this is related to the fact that we use method that is explicitly frame - independent : orbital angular momentum is not a poincar invariant quantity .    in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : massdep ] we show the mass dependence of the charge and magnetic radii ( defined analogously ) of the vector mesons .",
    "just like the pion charge radius  @xcite , both the charge and the magnetic radius decreases with increasing quark mass .",
    "our results for @xmath108 are qualitatively similar to a vmd curve , and over the entire mass range the charge radius can in fact be reasonably well described by a vmd curve with a constant shift of about @xmath109 .",
    "of course that means that the relative deviation from a vmd model increases with increasing quark mass , again just as in the case of the pion form factor .",
    "finally , we consider the single - quark transition form factors of the @xmath110 and @xmath111 mesons , at @xmath112 .",
    "this allows us to compare our results with the lattice simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite . both the magnetic moment and the quadrupole moment are in good agreement with the lattice data , see the bottom row of table  [ table : resultsrhokstar ] .",
    "also the charge radii are in reasonable agreement , with the vector state being slightly larger than the pseudoscalar state .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the quark - core contribution to mesonic observables , and do not include pion loop effects . however , the form factors , and their quark - mass dependence , are sensitive to pion loops , in particular at small quark masses .",
    "pion loops lead to corrections to the physical @xmath1 and @xmath113 charge radii of about 10% to 15%  @xcite , but their contributions decrease rapidly with increasing quark mass .",
    "similarly , we expect that at the physical up / down quark masses , the other form factors , @xmath77 and @xmath114 will also receive corrections of the order of 10% due to pion loops .",
    "that means that the mass dependence of the magnetic moment will be dominated by the pion loop corrections , given the very weak quark - mass dependence we find here .",
    "however , we expect these corrections to become negligible for masses around @xmath115 and above .",
    "we have calculated the electromagnetic form factors of the @xmath1 meson , and of both the charged and the neutral @xmath9 mesons .",
    "our method is explicitly poincar invariant , and we have demonstrated explicitly that physical observables are frame - independent . by dressing the quark - photon vertex",
    "we guarantee electromagnetic current conservations ; furthermore , our dressed quark - photon vertex exhibits poles in the timelike region , corresponding to intermediate vector mesons .",
    "exactly the same method , using the same model for the effective interaction  @xcite , has been used quite successfully to describe the pion electromagnetic form factor  @xcite and a plethora of other light meson observables within about 10% to 15%  @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect our results to have a similar level of accuracy .",
    "compared to other calculations , we find a stronger @xmath87-dependence , mostly due to the fact that we have incorporated unambiguously vmd effects in the quark - photon vertex , which have been neglected in refs .",
    "our results favor a magnetic moment close to two , in agreement with sum rule analysis  @xcite , and a quadrupole moment @xmath116 , which is similar to the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , but significantly smaller than suggested by other calculations  @xcite .",
    "our results for the quadrupole moment indicate that there is a significant amount of quark orbital angular momentum in the vector mesons .",
    "the magnetic moment is almost independent of the quark mass for mesons of equal - mass constituents . the quadrupole moment decreases with increasing quark mass .",
    "also the shape of the form factors changes : since the vmd pole in the timelike region shifts further away from @xmath117 with increasing quark mass , the form factors become less steep , and the radii decrease with increasing quark mass . over the entire quark mass range , from the chiral limit to the charm",
    "quark mass , the charge radius can be reasonably described by a vmd curve with a constant shift of about @xmath109 .",
    "a similar behavior of the form factors , and of their quark - mass dependence , has been obtained using the model of ref .",
    "@xcite for the effective quark - antiquark interaction .",
    "ideally experiments would guide us in order to discriminate between different models and different calculation methods , but it is unlikely that these form factors can be measured in the near future . lacking reliable experimental input , it would be very useful to have ( quenched ) lattice data for the vector meson form factors at light quark masses .",
