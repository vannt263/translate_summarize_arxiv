    "the interplay between quantum and classical descriptions of the physical world and the role of the measurement process are still at the heart of the understanding of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the related theoretical debate has been greatly enriched in the last decades by the realization of new experimental techniques aimed at producing quantum states without classical analogue , such as entangled or squeezed states , or to explore phenomena which are intrinsically quantum mechanical , like quantum jumps .",
    "all this occurred also having in mind practical implications , such as the improvement of sensitivity of various devices operating at or near the quantum limit @xcite .",
    "recently , the production of a novel state of matter - bose - einstein condensates of dilute atomic gases - has opened a new road to explore macroscopic quantum phenomena with the precision characteristic of atomic physics @xcite .",
    "bose - einstein condensates are naturally produced by cooling down atomic gases at ultralow temperature with the phase transition occurring in the 100 nk - 1@xmath0k temperature range , _",
    "i.e. _ when the thermal de broglie wavelength becomes comparable to the average spacing between the atoms of a dilute ( peak density @xmath1 atoms/@xmath2 ) trapped gas",
    ". usually samples of bose - einstein condensates are made by @xmath3 atoms in the case of alkali species @xcite , and @xmath4 or more in the case of hydrogen @xcite .",
    "their intrinsically small heat capacity does not allow for a direct manipulation and probing with material samples , such as microtips or nanostructures , since the thermal contact with the latter will induce a sudden vaporization of the bose sample .",
    "thus , manipulation and probing of bose - einstein condensates has been achieved so far only by using light beams .",
    "these probes can be classified according to the resonant or nonresonant nature of their interaction with the measured atomic sample . in the former case",
    ", the condensate interacts with a laser beam resonant ( or close to resonance ) with a selected atomic transition .",
    "the output beam is attenuated proportionally to the optical thickness of the condensate ( also called column density ) , _ i.e. _ the condensate density integrated along the line of sight of the impinging beam .",
    "the absorption of the photons leads to recoil of the atoms then strongly perturbing the condensate . for typical values of intensity and duration of the probe light",
    "the condensate is strongly heated and a new replica has to be produced to further study its dynamics . from the viewpoint of quantum measurement theory",
    "this measurement is of type - ii since it destroys the state of the observed system and forbids the study of the dynamics of a single quantum system @xcite .",
    "an alternative technique , called dispersive imaging , allows for repeated measurements on a bose - einstein condensate and , as an extreme case , its continuous monitoring . in this measurement scheme off - resonance light",
    "is scattered by the condensate , thereby locally inducing optical phase - shifts which can be converted into light intensity modulations by homodyne or heterodyne techniques , for instance by using phase - contrast @xcite or interference techniques @xcite .",
    "since the laser beam is off - resonant the absorption rate is small and the heating of the condensate is accordingly small .",
    "thus , multiple shots of the same condensate can be taken - a type - i measurement in the quantum measurement theory language - allowing the study of the dynamics on the same sample .",
    "this has allowed to overcome the unavoidable shot - to - shot fluctuations always present in the production of different samples of bose - einstein condensates .",
    "several phenomena whose observation rely on imaging at high accuracy the condensate , such as its formation in non - adiabatic conditions @xcite , short @xcite and long @xcite wavelength collective excitations , superfluid dynamics @xcite , vortices formation and decay @xcite , can be successfully studied with this technique .",
    "the repeated nondestructive monitoring lends itself to another question : _ is the measurement process influencing the dynamics of the condensate ? _ answers to this question are important also for disentangling the intrinsic condensate dynamics from the artifacts induced by the underlying measurement process . as we will see in this paper , the effect of the measurement",
    "can also be intentionally amplified to allow for unusual manipulation of the condensate itself .",
    "dispersive imaging , in its more idealized form , is preserving the number of atoms and therefore represent a particular example of quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement @xcite . we know",
    "that even quantum nondemolition measurements affect the state of the observed system , their unique feature being that the nondemolitive observable maintains the same _ average _ value , albeit the probability distribution of its outcome can be affected as well as the average values of all the conjugate observables .",
    "thus , we do expect that during the nondemolitive measurement of the condensate atom number there will be a measurement - induced nontrivial dynamics for both the variance of the monitored observable and the average values of all conjugate observables .",
    "besides gaining insight into the dynamics of the measurement process , our model allows for the description of the _ irreversible _ driving of the condensate toward nonclassical states .",
    "in this paper we try to answer the question formulated above by building a realistic model for dispersive measurements of the condensate , extending the results reported in @xcite to the weak measurement regime .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the dispersive coupling between atoms and light and derive the reduced master equation for the bose condensate tracing out the variables of the electromagnetic field degrees of freedom .",
    "under controllable approximations we obtain a lindblad equation which allows to estabilish the rates for phase diffusion and depletion of the condensate during the dispersive imaging . in section iii",
    "we unravel the lindblad equation in terms of a stochastic differential equation that , in the unmeasured case , corresponds to the description of a single n - body wavefunction .",
    "a solution of the stochastic n - body equation is discussed in the limit of strong continuous measurement , leading to the squeezing of number fluctuations , the main result described in @xcite . in the opposite limit of weak measurement and for an initial mean - field state",
    "this stochastic equation becomes the stochastic counterpart of the gross - pitaevskii equation , as discussed in section iv .",
    "its limit of validity is discussed in section v by comparing its evolution for various parameters versus the exact evolution in the simple situation of a two mode system schematizing a condensate in a double well potential .",
    "this allows us to analyze , in section vi , the effect of the measurement on the evolution of a condensate initially prepared in a soliton state .",
    "more general considerations on the potentiality of such an approach and its consequences are finally outlined in the conclusions .",
    "our main goal in this section is to include the atom - photon interaction present in the dispersive imaging of a bose - einstein condensate into its intrinsic dynamics .",
    "first attempts in this direction have been discussed in the prototypical situation of a two mode condensate in @xcite .",
    "let us start the analysis with the effective interaction hamiltonian between the off - resonant photons and the atoms , written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the density operator of the atomic vapor , and @xmath7 the electric field due to the intensity @xmath8 of the incoming light .",
    "the coefficient @xmath9 represents the effective electric susceptibility of the atoms defined as @xmath10 , where we have introduced the light wavelength @xmath11 and the light detuning measured in half - linewidths @xmath12 of the atomic transition , @xmath13 .",
    "we express the electric field in terms of creation and annihilation operators . in the coulomb gauge it takes the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 =   \\delta_{{\\bf k},{\\bf k'}}$ ] , and @xmath17 is the quantization volume",
    ".    equation ( [ intham ] ) allows us to write the reduced master equation for the atomic degrees of freedom by a standard technique , _",
    "i.e. _ by tracing out the photon degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the decoupling between the two relevant timescales for the photons ( settled by the the lifetime of spontaneous emission , of order of tens ns ) and for the atoms ( related to the oscillation period in the trapping potential , of the order of ms ) , allows to use the born - markov approximation .",
    "thus we get the master equation for the reduced density matrix @xmath18 of the condensate that , in the interaction picture , is written as    @xmath19 -   \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2 } { \\rm tr}_{\\rm r } [ h_{\\rm int } ( t ) , [ \\int_{-\\infty}^t dt ' h_{\\rm int}(t ' ) ,   \\rho(t ) \\otimes \\rho_{\\rm r}(t ) ] ] .",
    "\\label{me}\\ ] ]    the last term on the righthandside contains two different contributions both of lindblad type , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . as we will see soon , the former preserves the number of atoms in the condensate and is responsible for phase diffusion phenomena , while the latter changes the number of atoms leading to its depletion .",
    "let us first concentrate on phase - diffusion which is a number conserving mechanism . to calculate it we insert the interaction hamiltonian into the last term of eq.([me ] ) , with @xmath6 the condensate density operator . by introducing the fourier transform of the density operator such that    @xmath22    we obtain @xmath23 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 $ ] .",

    "it is possible to show that all normal ordered expectation values involving four operators cancel exactly , obtaining    @xmath29,\\ ] ]    where we have used the continuum limit @xmath30 .",
    "unless tomographic techniques are used as for instance in @xcite , the image results from a projection of the condensate onto the @xmath26 plane , by integrating along the @xmath31 direction .",
    "this demands to project the dynamics of the condensate into the imaging plane . in order to write a closed 2d master equation to describe the @xmath26 dynamics we assume the condensate wavefunction to be factorizable as @xmath32 .",
    "such factorization holds if the confinement in the @xmath31-direction is strong enough to make the corresponding mean - field energy negligible with respect to the energy quanta of the confinement , _ i.e. _ @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , with @xmath35 the s - wave scattering length , @xmath36 the condensate density , and @xmath37 the angular frequency of the confinement harmonic potential along the @xmath31 direction , as recently experimentally demonstrated in @xcite .",

    "when tunneling between different lattice sites is allowed ( @xmath109 ) , localization in a fock state is inhibited due to a competition between the measurement , which drives localization , and hopping , which tries to drive the state of the condensate towards coherent states . when measurement outweighs hopping , the final state of the bec is a number squeezed state .",

    "our situation has an important difference from the latter case : since the squeezing is driven by the ( lindblad ) measurement term the evolution into such states is irreversible , even after removal of the imaging photon field",

    "since no measurements are performed , an initial balanced population ( @xmath156 ) would remain balanced for all times , both at the gp and quantum level . for this reason we take an initial unbalanced population , @xmath168 , which due to the hopping term triggers rabi oscillations between the two wells ( just as the measurement did when we took initial balanced populations ) .",
    "it follows from the figure that the gp dynamics departs from the quantum one .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "3b the depletion corresponding to fig . 3a .",
    "again , this depletion remains small , less than one atom is depleted from the condensate .    as we can see in figs.2,3 ,",
    "both the sgp and gp evolutions depart from the exact evolution even in the weak measurement and interaction limits when the depletion from the condensate is small .",
    "the derivation of the backaction terms in the sgp equation requires only one assumption : all the atoms are in the condensate .",
    "in contrast , the derivation of the interaction terms ( both for sgp and gp equations ) not only assumes that all the atoms are in the condensate but also makes further approximations to describe the evolution of the condensate wavefunction @xmath169 .",
    "this is why @xmath170 causes both the sgp and gp evolutions to depart from the exact quantum evolution even for negligible depletion .",
    "however , even after the departure the sgp and gp evolutions remain qualitatively similar to the exact evolution , see figs .",
    "2a and 3a .    to summarize ,",
    "the accuracy of the sgp equation is limited by the weak measurement condition , @xmath171 , and by the nonlinear interaction .",
    "for a weak measurement the accuracy of the sgp equation is the same as that of the gp equation . in the next section",
    "we apply the sgp equation to show how the measurement can trigger the unwinding of a dark soliton @xcite in a realistic experimental setup .",
    "once delimited the validity of the stochastic gross - pitaevskii equation in the simple situation of a two - mode system we can apply it to the more complex case of imaging of a condensate state with a nontrivial phase such as a soliton . even in the limit of weak measurement , with the solution still approximable in terms of gross - pitaevskii coherent states ,",
    "the effect of the measurement is present and affects the observable conjugate to the atom number , i.e. the phase of the condensate . as an example of application of the sgpe",
    "let us consider an isotropic harmonic 2d trapping potential @xmath172 .",
    "the condensate is assumed to be in the thomas - fermi limit of strong repulsive interaction where the ground state wavefunction can be well approximated by    @xmath173    the constant @xmath174 , the chemical potential , is chosen so that the wavefunction is normalized to @xmath175 .",
    "let us use as the initial state a dark soliton @xcite imprinted on the thomas - fermi ground state    @xmath176    here @xmath177 is the healing length at the peak density in the ground state ( [ gstf ] ) .    in our numerical simulations",
    "we assume the following parameters relevant for @xmath178rb : mass @xmath179 kg , scattering length @xmath180 nm , @xmath181m@xmath182 , wavelength @xmath183 nm .",
    "the width of the gaussian @xmath41 is assumed to be @xmath184 m . with these parameters",
    "the resolution of the kernel is @xmath185 m . we assume a 2d harmonic trap frequency @xmath186 . with @xmath187 we get a 2d thomas - fermi radius of @xmath188 .",
    "we also assume the laser intensity of @xmath74 .",
    "the former parameters give a weak measurement strength in the sense discussed in sections iii and iv , so that the use of the sgp equation is justified .",
    "indeed , this continuous problem can be mapped on the lattice model eq.([lattice ] ) , where the lattice constant is the kernel resolution @xmath83 .",
    "given the thomas - fermi radius of @xmath188 , and @xmath185 m , we estimate the lattice to be composed of @xmath189 sites with an average of @xmath190 atoms per site .",
    "the measurement strength is equal to @xmath191 , and the effective hopping frequency for the lattice model is @xmath192 .",
    "therefore @xmath193 , thus confirming a weak measurement regime .    to simulate the continuum sgp equation ( [ sgpecont ] )",
    "we discretized it using a lattice constant @xmath194 times smaller than the kernel resolution @xmath83 .",
    "the program uses a split step method : the fast fourier transform was used to carry out the time integration of the kinetic term and of the nonlocal terms involving the kernel , and the potential and nonlinear coupling terms were integrated in time in the position representation . a cross - section along the @xmath195-axis through the probability density of the initial state ( [ psi0 ] )",
    "is shown in ( a ) of fig.4 .",
    "cross sections through probability densities at later times after the probe light beam has been sent on the condensate are shown in cases ( b ) and ( c ) of fig.4 .",
    "for comparison , the time evolution without the measurement does not result in any soliton unwinding .",
    "the soliton unwinds after roughly @xmath196ms .",
    "this time is much shorter than the depletion time @xmath197s discussed at the end of section ii .",
    "the measurement induces soliton unwinding much earlier that any detectable depletion of atoms occurs .",
    "figure [ stage0 ] suggests that the unwinding will manifest itself by filling up the soliton core with atoms .",
    "such a greying of the dark soliton can also occur through a different mechanism that involves collisions between condensate atoms .",
    "in ref.@xcite it was demonstrated that the dark soliton can grey on a timescale of tens of ms because its core fills up with non - condensed atoms ( quantum ) depleted from the condensate as a result of atomic collisions between condensed atoms .",
    "this result is supported by ref.@xcite where it was shown that the quantum state with minimal depletion has depletion strongly concentrated in the soliton core .",
    "this quantum depletion process does not unwind the soliton : the condensate remains in the soliton state with a phase jump of @xmath198 .",
    "the phase jump or its unwinding could be detected by interference between two condensates , one of them in a ground state and the other with a soliton @xcite . a simpler way to verify that observed greying is due to the measurement induced unwinding is to change the measurement strength in a certain range and see if the greying time depends on the imaging laser intensity .",
    "we simulated the soliton unwinding for a range of measurement strengths .",
    "5 shows the unwinding time @xmath199 versus the laser intensity @xmath8 .",
    "the time @xmath199 is defined as that for which the density at @xmath200 in fig .",
    "4 achieves @xmath201 of the maximal density .",
    "quantum measurement theory has been applied to the dispersive imaging of a bose - einstein condensate . in the strong measurement limit",
    "the condensate is irreversibly driven into non - classical states with reduced number fluctuations . in the opposite limit of weak measurement",
    "the condensate can be approximately described for short timescales through a stochastic counterpart of the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "the latter has been applied for the study of the dynamics induced by dispersive imaging on a condensate prepared in a soliton state .",
    "the proposed model , besides allowing to intentionally design selective manipulation of the condensate state for instance to quench vortices without introducin appreciable depletion , could also lead to a better understanding of quantum phase transitions @xcite in bose condensates @xcite .",
