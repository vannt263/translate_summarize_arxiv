    "the glass transition occurring in many materials can be induced by changing different control parameters . in molecular liquids , for example , the temperature is the relevant control parameter  @xcite , while in hard sphere systems the transition is controlled by the density  @xcite . in other systems , such as attractive or soft colloids , both temperature and density play an important role  @xcite . despite this variety , glass  forming materials exhibit common features .",
    "indeed , on approaching the glass transition one observes a dramatic increase of the relaxation time , a vanishing diffusivity , the breakdown of the stokes ",
    "einstein relation  @xcite and the emergence of dynamical heterogeneities  @xcite . at the microscopic level",
    ", one observes the emergence of an increasingly intermittent single particle motion , both in equilibrium supercooled liquids  @xcite and aging glasses  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in glassy systems particles spend most of their time confined within the cages formed by their neighbors , and seldom make a jump to a different cage .",
    "this universality suggests that jumps might be the elementary irreversible events allowing for the relaxation of the structural glasses  @xcite . if this is so , then particles move performing a random random walk with step size of average length @xmath0 , and average duration , @xmath1 .",
    "since the jump duration is small with respect to relaxation time , an important consequence of this scenario is the possibility of determining the diffusivity @xmath2 on the time ",
    "scale of the jump duration , i.e. well before the system enters the diffusive regime .",
    "indeed , one expects @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the density of jumps , i.e. the fraction of particles that are making a jump at every instant of time .",
    "we have recently investigated this scenario via numerical simulations of a molecular liquid model  @xcite , through an algorithm able to segment the trajectory of each particle in cages and jumps .",
    "this allowed to verify that jumps are irreversible events , and that the relation between the features of the cage ",
    "jump motion and the diffusivity holds as the dynamics slow down by lowering the temperature .    in this paper",
    "we experimentally investigate whether a similar scenario holds in hard sphere like systems , where the density is the relevant control parameter and the temperature plays a minor role , as it simply fix the dynamical time - scale .",
    "this is not obvious , as the physical mechanisms responsible for the slow down of molecular and of hard sphere systems might be different .",
    "indeed , in the first case the slow down occurs on cooling as the system spends an increasing amount of time close to minima of its potential energy landscape  @xcite .",
    "conversely , in hard sphere systems the slowing down has a purely entropic origin , and the elementary relaxation events might not be single particle jumps , but rather structural rearrangements involving a finite number of particles  @xcite . via the experimental investigation of a two  dimensional hard  sphere  like colloidal system , here we show that particle jumps are irreversible and that they are short lived with respect to the relaxation time .",
    "this allows for a short time prediction of the diffusivity of hard  sphere sphere systems via eq .",

    "the sample cell was prepared with a microscope slide and a no.1 thickness coverslip separated by two parafilm stripes .",
    "heating the whole cell up to @xmath8 allowed the parafilm stripes to melt and then to glue the two glasses .",

    "random walk approximation  @xcite , these two distributions are related by @xmath41 .",
    "the two distributions are characterized by different average values , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , whose volume fraction dependence is illustrated fig .",
    "[ fig : cage_stats]c , together with the volume fraction dependence of the relaxation time @xmath44 .",
    "we observe @xmath42 and @xmath43 to have a similar behaviour , and the persistence time to scale exactly as the relaxation time , consistently with the relation between @xmath27 and @xmath37 mentioned above . in the continuous time",
    "random walk description of the relaxation of structural glasses , the agreement between @xmath42 and @xmath43 implies the validity of the stokes ",
    "einstein relation , in agreement with our system being in the mode  coupling regime . as a further characterization of the temporal features of the cage  jump motion , we illustrate in fig .  [ fig : cage_stats]d and e the probability distribution of the jump duration , @xmath45 , which decays exponentially , and the volume fraction dependence of the average value @xmath1 , which decreases on compression . an exponential @xmath45 distribution has been also observed in model molecular glasses , but in that case the average value was found to be temperature independent  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : cage_stats]d , e offer us the opportunity to clarify that the elementary process identified with a jump has a finite duration , which in the present case can be of the order of minutes .",
    "the use of the term ` jump ' , which suggests the presence of short  lived events , is only justified as the jump duration should be compared with the relaxation time of the system .",
    "for instance , in this work the ratio @xmath46 increases from @xmath47 , at the smallest volume fraction with glassy features , to @xmath48 , at the highest volume fraction we have considered .",
    "we finally consider that , at every instant of time , a particle is either caged or jumping .",
    "accordingly , by observing the system for a time of the order of @xmath49 , which is the timescale considered by the protocol used to segment the trajectory in cages and jump , we can measure the density of jumps @xmath4 .",
    "this equals the probability that a particle is jumping at a generic time @xmath18 , and is therefore related to the fraction of the total time particles spend jumping , @xmath50 fig .",
    "[ fig : cage_stats]f shows that this equation is verified by our data . as mentioned above ,",
    "as the dynamics slows down the jump duration becomes much smaller than the relaxation time , so that @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "we also note that in order to compute the r.h.s of the above equation one has to estimate @xmath53 : this requires to reliably sample the waiting time distribution @xmath40 , an operation accomplished on a time scale of the order of the relation time @xmath36 .",
    "conversely the l.h.s . can be estimated on a small and density independent timescale of the order of @xmath54 , as the only requirement is to observe a finite number of jumps .",
    "as the density decreases , the ratio @xmath55 decreases , which implies that we predict a long time feature from a short time analysis .    as a final characterization of the cage ",

    "the probability distribution of the jump length , @xmath59 , and the volume fraction dependence of @xmath60 are illustrated in fig.s  [ fig : jump_stats]a and b. as in molecular systems  @xcite @xmath59 decays exponentially , and its average value decreases as the dynamics slow down .",

    "our experimental investigation proves that , in the considered volume fraction range , single particle jumps are the irreversible events that allow for the relaxation of hard sphere colloidal glasses .",
    "this allows for a short time prediction of the diffusivity .",
    "this result complements our earlier numerical study of a model molecular glass  @xcite , where we also proved single particle jumps to be irreversible events .",
    "indeed , we have found the same physical scenario to capture both the slow down of the dynamics of molecular glass formers , for which temperature is the relevant control parameter , and of colloidal glasses , for which density is the control parameter .",

    "open questions ahead include the investigation of the validity of this approach at higher volume fractions , where the irreversible events might involve the rearrangement of many particles , as previously speculated  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it would be interesting to consider three dimensional systems , even tough we expect the dimensionality to play a minor role , both because structural glasses exhibit an intermittent single particle motion in two and three dimensions , as well as because frustration effects , that might favor collective relaxation processes , are less relevant in high dimensions .      30 c.a .",
