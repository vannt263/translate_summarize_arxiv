    "studies of magnetization reversal in ultra - thin ferromagnetic films under an applied external magnetic field are of great importance in magnetic recording physics .",
    "a conventional theoretical tool to study magnetization reversal is based on the phenomenological landau - lifshitz equation @xcite or , its equivalent modification with the gilbert form of relaxation gilbert .",
    "these equations conserve the absolute value of magnetization ( @xmath2 )  in a single domain region .",
    "both equations were introduced ( a ) for small magnetization motions and ( b ) for the case of uniaxial magnetic symmetry .",
    "the energy losses are defined by an isotropic phenomenological damping fitting parameter @xmath3 ( damping constant ) .",
    "recently a theoretical approach @xcite , @xcite , wangbertsaf1 , @xcite , @xcite has been developed to correct the limitations of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) theory .",
    "the main idea was to represent the magnetization dynamics as the motion of a damped nonlinear oscillator with the random force of thermal fluctuations .",
    "the oscillator model is a convenient tool to establish a bridge  between the microscopic physics , where the rotational oscillator complex variables naturally describe spin excitations and the macroscopic magnetization dynamics .",
    "it has been rigorously shown by including specific coupling of a magnetic system to a variety of loss mechanisms @xcite , @xcite that for small oscillations near equilibrium the macroscopic damping term reflects the anisotropy of the system .",
    "our aim in this paper is to develop a self - consistent picture that describes the entire reversal process .",
    "we consider two possible scenarios : 1 ) the magnetization reverses uniformly , involving nonlinear dynamic damping ; 2 ) the magnetization reverses nonuniformly , involving the excitation of nonlinear spin waves .",
    "we give an explicit criterion for this nonuniform process for an untra - thin magnetic film .",
    "_ scenario # 1 : _ _  _ the total film magnetization @xmath4 is constant during reversal .",
    "all spins perform a coherent motion ( the role of non - uniform spin motions is neglected ) .",
    "an excess of magnetic energy goes directly to a nonmagnetic thermal bath .",
    "we derive a general magnetization dynamic equation from a nonlinear oscillator model .",
    "the nonlinear damping follows from the variety of well - known physical damping mechanisms nonrelax , @xcite .",
    "here we extend our previous results for uniaxial symmetry to the case of non - uniaxial symmetry .",
    "_ scenario # 2 : _ the total film magnetization @xmath4 decreases .",
    "experimentally it was observed in ref .",
    "large angle magnetization motion can excite spin - wave instabilities , which increase substantially the magnetization reversal rate @xcite .",
    "we explicitly evaluate the second order suhl instability and construct a self - consistent theory of magnetization switching for up to @xmath1 from equilibrium .",
    "the problem of nonlinear spin - wave excitation during reversal has been explored by numerical simulations in nanograins @xcite , safbert1 , and thin films @xcite , @xcite .",
    "all these simulations have been performed using conventional local micromagnetic modeling , which includes : a ) the analysis of intra- and inter - cell interactions , b ) analysis of phenomenological dynamic equations , and c ) computer simulations .",
    "there are two principal problems in this technique : 1 ) the physical problem of the introduction of local phenomenological damping ( and corresponding magnetic noise ) and 2 ) the computing problem in the case of a large number of cells",
    ".    both problems of local micromagnetic modeling can be avoided by developing the @xmath0-space micromagnetic modeling as we do in this work .",
    "our theory includes : a ) an analysis of spin - wave spectra and interactions in an ultra - thin film , b ) the calculation of the effective scattering processes ( most of the accumulated energy is to be transformed to nonlinear spin waves ) , c ) the analysis of self - consistent dynamic equations with microscopic damping ( and noise , if necessary ) . note that a similar technique to study nonlinear spin - wave dynamics has been developed in the theory of parametric magnon excitation ( mainly in the bulk , see , e.g. , schloemann , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we have already considered @xmath0-space modeling in application to magnetic noise in a thin film @xcite .",
    "recently dobin and victora dobinvictora estimated the increment of the second order suhl instability and corresponding effective magnetization reversal time for up to @xmath5 deviation from equilibrium in the film plane .",
    "here we give an explicit analytic formulation to describe magnetization reversal ( switching ) for up to @xmath1 deviation from equilibrium in ultra - thin films in terms of spin - wave pair excitations .",
    "in this section we consider the magnetization reversal without spin - wave excitations . the approach is to transform the magnetization dynamics without damping to normal mode coordinates .",
    "then we introduce nonlinear damping , which has a connection with microscopic physics and return back to magnetization coordinates .",
    "the analysis parallels the approach for low - level excitations .",
    "let us consider small - amplitude magnetization motions of a single - domain ferromagnetic particle in the vicinity of equilibrium state @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the unit vector in the equilibrium direction .",
