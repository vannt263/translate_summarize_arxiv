    "the possibility that the dm is composed of the standard model ( sm ) particles has been ruled out for a long time already . indeed , the dm can not be made out of baryons , as producing such an amount of baryonic matter would require drastic modifications of the scenario of the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , which otherwise successfully describes the abundance of light elements  ( see for example  @xcite ) .",

    ". for a review of particle physics dm candidates see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "secondly , there should exist mechanisms of dm production with the correct abundances .",
    "the production mechanism in particular determines the velocity distribution of particles in the early universe .",
    "this velocity distribution can , in principle , be probed experimentally .",
    "namely , if during the structure formation epoch the dm particles have velocities , comparable to the speed of sound in the baryon - photon plasma , they `` erase '' density fluctuations at scales , smaller than the distance , they have traveled ( called the _ free - streaming length _ ) . to differentiate various models in accordance with this property , the dm candidates with the negligible velocity dispersion ( and ,",
    "correspondingly , free - streaming ) are called _ cold _ dm ( cdm ) , while those with the free - streaming of the order of @xmath10 are considered to be _ warm _ ( wdm )",
    ".  mpc . ]",
    "it is possible to constrain the free - streaming length of a particular dm candidate by probing the structure of the universe at galaxy - size scales .",
    "this can be done through the analysis of the lyman-@xmath11 forest data  @xcite .",
    "lyman-@xmath11 analysis puts an upper bound on the free - streaming of the dm particles  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted however that currently existing interpretation of the lyman-@xmath11 data is model - dependent , as , apart from a number of astrophysical assumptions ( see  @xcite ) and complicated hydrodynamic simulations , it relies on _ a priori _ assumptions about the velocity distribution of the dm particles .    a way to differentiate between cdm and wdm models would be to compare the numerical simulations of the dm distribution in the milky way - type galaxies with the actual observations .",
    "however , the resolution of the n - body simulations is not yet sufficient to answer the questions about e.g. the dm density profiles in dwarf satellite galaxies .",
    "moreover , most of the simulations include only collisionless dm particles , and do not model the baryons and their feedback on the galaxy structure formation .",
    "these problems are not solved even for the cdm simulations , and wdm simulations have additional serious difficulties . from an observational point of view , it has been argued for some time already that there is a discrepancy between cdm simulations and observations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) it has been claimed recently that a number of recent observations of dwarf satellite galaxies of the milky way and andromeda galaxy seem to indicate the existence of the smallest scale at which the dm exists  @xcite .",
    "however , this statement and the interpretation of the observations are still subject to debate  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is too early to say what kind of dm models is favoured by comparing simulations and observations .",
    "usually it is also necessary for the dm candidate to be stable . for the most popular dm candidate  weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , this is related to the fact that the particles of @xmath12 electroweak mass , having weak strength interaction with sm matter ( required to produce the correct amount of dm ) , would decay too fast and would not be `` dark '' .",
    "if , however , the dm particle interacts with the sm more weakly than wimps , it could well have a finite ( although cosmologically long ) life time .",
    "there exist several unstable ( decaying ) dm candidates e.g. gravitino  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate mainly on one candidate , the sterile neutrino ( although our results will be applicable for any type of decaying dm )",
    ". constraints on the decaying dm were analyzed in  @xcite ( see also the book by  @xcite ) .",
    "it was noticed long ago that the right - handed ( or as it is often called _ sterile _ ) neutrino with the mass in the kev range would represent a viable dm candidate  @xcite .",
    "such a neutrino would interact with the rest of the matter only via the quadratic mixing with left - handed ( _ active _ ) neutrinos and therefore ( although not stable ) could have cosmologically long life - time . at the same time , it could be produced in the early universe with the correct abundances  @xcite .",
    "one of the decay channels of the unstable sterile neutrinos includes emission of photons of the energy equal to half of the sterile neutrino rest energy .",
    "this potentially provides a possibility to observe the decays of dm sterile neutrinos via detection of a characteristic spectral line in the spectra of astrophysical objects with large dm concentration .",
    "recently this dm candidate has attracted much attention ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it was found that a very modest and natural extension of the sm by 3 right - handed neutrinos ( making the sm more symmetric as all sm fermions , including neutrino , would have now their left and right handed counterparts ) provided a viable extension of the theory , capable of solving several `` beyond the sm '' problems .",
    "first of all , such an extension makes neutrinos massive and thus perhaps provides the simplest and the most natural explanation of the phenomenon of `` neutrino oscillations ''  ( see e.g.  @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses in this model ( called @xmath13msmin  @xcite ) is achieved by the usual see - saw mechanism with majorana masses of right - handed neutrinos being below electroweak scale.msmdoes not introduce any new scale above the electroweak one , makes this theory especially appealing from the point of view of its experimental verification / falsification . ]    secondly , if two heavier sterile neutrinos ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) are almost degenerate in mass and have their masses between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the @xmath13msmprovides the mechanism of generating the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "thirdly , the lightest sterile neutrino @xmath18 can have arbitrary mass and arbitrarily weak coupling with the ( active ) neutrino sector . at the same time",
    ", it can be produced in the early universe in the correct amounts .",
    "it represents therefore the dm particle in the @xmath13msm .",
    "thus , altogether the @xmath13msmrepresents ( arguably ) the simplest extension of the sm , capable of explaining three important questions : origin and smallness of neutrino masses , baryon asymmetry in the universe and the existence of the dm .",
    "what are the current restrictions on parameters ( mass and _ mixing _ ) of sterile neutrino dm ?",
    "first of all sterile neutrino mass should satisfy the universal tremaine - gunn lower bound : @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite can be obtained in the case of the particular production mechanisms  the dodelson - widrow scenario  @xcite . for other possible production mechanisms  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the ly-@xmath11 constraints should be reanalyzed . ]",
    "next , as the sterile neutrino possesses the ( two - body ) radiative decay channel : @xmath20 , the emitted photon would carry the energy @xmath21 .",
    "a large flux of such photons is expected from the large concentrations of the dm sterile neutrinos , like galaxies or galaxy clusters .",
    "recently an extensive search of the dm decay line in the region of masses @xmath22 was conducted , using the data of _ chandra _",
    "@xcite and _ xmm - newton _  @xcite .",
    "the region of soft x - ray ( down to energies @xmath23  kev ) was explored by  @xcite with the use of the wide field of view spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "the non - observation of the dm decay line in x - ray , combined with the first principles calculation of dm production in the early universe  @xcite , implies that the @xcite ( dw ) scenario can work only if the sterile neutrino mass is below 4  kev  @xcite .",
    "if one takes into account recent _ lower _ bound on the mass of sterile neutrino dm in the dw scenario @xmath24  @xcite , it seems that the possibility that all the dm is produced via dw scenario is ruled out  @xcite .",
    "the possibility that only fraction of the dm is produced via dw mechanism remains open  @xcite .",
    "there are other viable mechanisms of dm production , including e.g. resonant oscillation production in the presence of lepton asymmetries  @xcite .",
    "sterile neutrino dm can be produced by the decay of light inflaton @xcite or in a similar model with the different choice of parameters  @xcite .",
    "these mechanisms are currently not constrained and remain valid for dm particles with the masses in the kev range and above .    the search for the dm decay line signal produced by sterile neutrinos with masses above @xmath25  kev is complicated by the absence of the focusing optics telescopes ( similar to _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ ) in the hard x - ray and @xmath26-ray domain of the spectrum .",
    "for example , the existing restrictions in the @xmath27  kev mass range @xcite are derived from the observations of diffuse x - ray background , with the help of non - imaging instruments , heao - i  @xcite . the current status of astrophysical observations in summarized in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use the spectrometer spi on board of integral satellite to place restrictions on parameters of decaying dm in the mass range @xmath28 .",
    "this range of masses is interesting , for example , the sterile neutrinos , produced in the early universe in the presence of large lepton asymmetries  @xcite or through the inflaton decay  @xcite .",
    "it is also relevant for the case of gravitino dm  @xcite .    when the preparation of this paper was at its final stage ,  ( * ?",
    "* hereafter * y07 * ) published their work , which used the results of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter * t06 * ) to place restrictions on the parameters of sterile neutrino dm in the range @xmath29 .",
    "we discuss it in more details in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the absence of the focusing optics significantly reduces the sensitivity of the telescopes operating in the hard x - ray / soft @xmath26-ray  energy band . most of the instruments operating in this energy band use collimators and/or coded masks to distinguish signals from the sources on the sky from the instrumental background .",
    "contrary to the focusing optics telescopes , both the source and background signals are collected from the entire detector , which significantly increases the irreducible background .",
    "the focusing optics enables to significantly reduce the background only in the studies of point sources .",
    "if the source under investigation occupies a large fraction of the sky ( e.g. the entire milky way galaxy ) , the performance of the focusing and non - focusing instruments with the same detector collection area are , in fact , comparable .        in the case of an extended source , emitting a narrow spectral line , an efficient way of reduction of instrumental background is via the improvement of the spectral resolution of the instrument ( in the case of a broad continuum background spectrum , the number of background counts at the energy of the line is proportional to the spectral resolution @xmath30 ) .",
    "the best possible sensitivity is achieved when the spectral resolution reaches the intrinsic width of the spectral line ( see fig.[fig : spi_vs_heao ] for the case of wide fov instruments and  @xcite for the case of narrow fov instruments ) .    in the case of the line produced by the dm decaying in the milky way halo ,",
    "the line width is determined by the doppler broadening by the random motion of the dm particles .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the dm motion in the halo is about the rotation velocity of the galactic disk , @xmath31  km / s .",
    "this means that doppler broadening of the dm decay line is about @xmath32 thus , the optimal spectral resolution of an instrument searching for the dm decay line produced by the milky way dm halo should be @xmath33 .",
    "such optimal spectral resolution is almost achieved with the spectrometer spi on board of _ integral _  satellite , which has the maximal spectral resolving power of @xmath34 and works in the energy range 20  kev  8  mev  @xcite .",
    "spi is a `` coded mask '' type instrument with an array of 19 hexagonal shaped ge detectors ( of which only 17 are operating at the moment ) .",
    "the spi telescope consists of a coded mask inscribed into a circle of the radius @xmath35  cm , placed at the height @xmath36  cm above the detector plane and of the detector , which has the shape of a hexagon inscribed into a circle of the radius @xmath37  cm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fov ] ) .",
    "the portion of the sky visible from each point of the spi detector ( the so - called _ fully coded field of view _ , fcfov ) has therefore angular diameter @xmath38",
    "\\approx 16^\\circ\\;,\\ ] ] while the portion of the sky visible by at least some of the detectors ( the _ partially coded field of view _ , pcfov )",

    "[ fig : fov ] ) .",
    "wide field of view makes the spi telescope suitable for the study of the very extended sources , like the milky way dm halo .",
    "the expected surface brightness of the dm decay line in a given direction on the sky is a function of the angular distance @xmath41 between the given direction on the sky and the direction towards the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "it can be calculated by taking the integral of the dm density profile @xmath42 along the line of sight ( `` _ _ column density _ _ '' ) @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the distance from the solar system to the gc .",
    "angle @xmath41 is related to the galactic coordinates @xmath45 via @xmath46 thus , the galactic center corresponds to @xmath47 , the anti - center @xmath48 , and the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane to @xmath49 .",
    "the expected dm flux is given then by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the dm decay rate    in general , the surface brightness @xmath52 is variable across the telescope fov .",
    "this is especially true for a wide field of view ( fov ) instruments ( like spi ) . in order to calculate the detector count rate , one has to integrate flux  ( [ fdm ] ) over the fov and over the ( effective ) detector area and then divide by the energy of the photons , @xmath53 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 are the angular coordinates in the fov",
    ", @xmath56 is the effective area at energy @xmath57 for the photons , coming from the direction ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the effective area of the spi detector ( which is determined by the transparency of the mask and the quantum efficiency of the detector ) changes with the photon energy . for an on - axis point source ,",
    "@xmath59 the integral of eq .",

    "[ fig : aeffon ] .      in the general case of extended sources , evaluation of the detector count rate  ( [ r ] )",
    "analytically is not possible because of the complicated dependence of the effective area on the off - axis angle ( shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : area ] ) . in the simplest case of an extended source with a constant surface brightness @xmath62 , the integral of eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) reduces to the multiplication by the solid angle @xmath63 and the effective area , averaged over the fov : @xmath64 the numerical factor @xmath65 depends on the energy and has to be calculated via a numerical integration over the energy dependent off - axis response map of the spi detector . a reasonably accurate numerical approximation to @xmath65",
    "is given by @xmath66 one can see that @xmath67 in all the energy interval .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the detector area visible from a given direction on the sky strongly decreases with the increase of the off - axis angle of this direction , so that the sky - averaged effective area is much smaller than the on - axis effective area of the detector . substituting ( [ eq:15 ] ) , ( [ eq:13 ] ) into ( [ r ] )",
