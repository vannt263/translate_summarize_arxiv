    "fair allocation problems arise naturally in various real - world contexts and are the object of study in several research areas such as mathematics , game theory and operations research .",
    "these problems consist in sharing resources among several self - interested parties ( players or agents ) so that each party receives his / her due share . at the same time",
    "the resources should be utilized in an efficient way from a central point of view .",
    "a wide variety of fair allocation problems have been addressed in the literature depending on the resources to be shared , the fairness criteria , the preferences of the agents , and other aspects for evaluating the quality of the allocation .    in this paper",
    "we focus on a specific discrete allocation problem , introduced briefly in @xcite , that can be seen as a multi - agent _ subset sum problem _ : a common and bounded resource ( representing e.g. , bandwidth , budget , space , etc . )",
    "is to be shared among a set of agents each owning a number of indivisible items .",
    "the items require a certain amount of the resource , called item weight and the problem consists in selecting , for each agent , a subset of items so that the sum of all selected items weights is not larger than a given upper bound expressing the resource capacity .",
    "we assume that the utility function of each agent consists of the sum of weights over all selected items of that agent . in this context , maximizing the resource utilization is equivalent to determining the solution of a classical , i.e.  single agent , subset sum problem . since we are interested in solutions implementing some fairness criteria , we call the addressed problem the _ fair subset sum problem _ ( fssp ) .    throughout the paper , as usual with allocation problems , we consider for each agent a _ utility function _ which assigns for any feasible solution a certain utility value to that agent .",
    "we assume that the system utility ( e.g.  the overall resource utilization in an allocation problem ) is given by the sum of utilities over all agents .",
    "this assumption of additivity appears frequently in quantitative decision analysis ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the solution is chosen by a central decision maker while the agents play no active role in the process .",
    "the decision maker is confronted with two objectives : on one hand , there is the maximization of the sum of utilities over all agents . on the other hand , such a _ system optimum _ may well be highly unbalanced .",
    "for instance , it could assign all resources to one agent only and this may have severe negative effects in many application scenarios .",
    "thus , it would be beneficial to reach a certain degree of agents satisfaction by implementing some criterion of fairness .",
    "clearly , the maximum utility taken only over all fair solutions will in general deviate from the system optimum and thus incurs a loss of utility for the overall system . in this paper",
    "we want to analyze this loss of utility implied by a fair solution from a worst - case point of view . this should give the decision maker a guideline or quantified argument about the _ cost of fairness_. a standard indicator for measuring this system efficiency loss is given by the relative loss of utility of a fair solution compared to the system optimum in a worst - case sense , which is called _ price of fairness _",
    "( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the concept of fairness is not uniquely defined in the scientific literature since it strongly depends on the specific problem setting and also on the agents perception of what a fair solution is . in this paper",
    "we consider three types of fair solutions , namely proportional fair , maximin and kalai - smorodinski solutions ( definitions are given in section  [ sec : notation ] ) .",
    "moreover , we formalize several properties of fair solutions ",
    "some of which have been already investigated in some specific contexts  holding for any general multi - agent problem without any specific assumption on the utility sets , contrarily from most of the scientific literature on allocation or multi - agent problems .",
    "the most significant part of this work is devoted to completely characterizing @xmath0 for the fair subset sum problem with two agents for the three above mentioned fairness concepts .",
    "caragiannis et al .",
    "@xcite were the first to introduce the concept of @xmath0 in the context of fair allocation problems : in particular , they compare the value of total agents utility in a global optimal solution with the maximum total utility obtained over all fair solutions ( they make use of several notions of fairness namely , proportionality , envy - freeness and equitability ) . in @xcite , bertsimas",
    "focus on proportional fairness and maximin fairness and provide a tight characterization of the price of fairness for a broad family of allocation problems with compact and convex agents utility sets .",
    "the price of fairness measures the inefficiency implied by fairness constraints , similarly to the utility loss implied by selfish behavior of agents and quantified by the price of anarchy ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . from a wider perspective , many authors have dealt with the problem of balancing global efficiency and fairness in terms of defining appropriate models or designing suitable objective functions or determining tradeoff solutions ( see for instance @xcite ) . a recent survey on the operations research literature that considers",
    "the tradeoff between efficiency and equity is @xcite .",
    "the subset sum problem considered in this paper is related to the so - called _ knapsack sharing problem _ in which different agents try to fit their own items in a common knapsack ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the problem consists in determining the solution that tries to balance the profits among the agents by maximizing the objective of the agent with minimum profit .",
    "as we will see , this problem is equivalent to determining a specific type of fair solution , known as maximin solution in the literature .",
    "another special knapsack problem has been addressed in @xcite , where a bi - objective extension of the linear multiple choice knapsack ( lmck ) problem is considered .",
    "the author wants to maximize the profit while minimizing the maximum difference between the resource amounts allocated to any two agents .",
    "fairness concepts have been widely studied in the context of _ fair division _",
    "problems , see e.g.  @xcite for a general overview , and in many other application scenarios ( mostly in telecommunications systems @xcite and , more recently , in cloud computing @xcite ) . in particular , in @xcite the authors point out that resource allocation in computing systems is one of the hottest topics of interest for both computer scientists and economists .",
    "fair division includes a great variety of different problems in which a set of goods has to be divided among several agents each having its own preferences .",
    "the goods to be divided can be ( @xmath1 ) a single heterogeneous good as in the classical cake - cutting problem ( see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite , which considers price of fairness in the line of @xcite ) , ( @xmath2 ) several divisible goods as in resource allocation problems ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , or ( @xmath3 ) several indivisible goods ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the fair subset sum problem we address is strongly related to fair division .",
    "it can be seen either as a single resource allocation problem in which the resource can be only allocated in predetermined blocks / portions ( the item weights ) or as a special case of the indivisible goods problem in which , due to an additional capacity constraint , only a selection of the goods can be allocated .",
    "a different but related scenario is presented in @xcite , where a game is considered in which several agents own different tasks each requiring certain resources .",
    "the agents compete for the usage of the scarce resources and have to select the tasks to be allocated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section provides the basic definitions , the formal statements for the problems studied ( section [ sec : def_ss ] ) and a summary of our results ( section [ sec : summary ] ) .",
    "some properties which hold for any general @xmath4-agent problem are given in section [ sec : general ] , where the special case of problems with a symmetric structure is also addressed . in section [ sec : subsetsum ] we consider the fair subset sum problem with two agents in two different scenarios . in particular , in section [ sec : separate ] we present the results concerning the case in which the two agents have two disjoint sets of items , while in section [ sec : shared ] the case in which the agents share a common set of items is considered .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conc ] some conclusions are drawn .",
    "consider a general multi - agent problem @xmath5 , e.g.  some type of resource allocation problem , in which we are given a set of @xmath4 agents @xmath6 and let @xmath7 be the set of all feasible solutions , e.g.  allocations .",
    "each agent @xmath8 has a utility function @xmath9 .",
    "if two solutions @xmath10 and @xmath11 yield the same utility for all agents , i.e.  @xmath12 for all @xmath8 , then we are not interested in distinguishing between them and we consider @xmath10 and @xmath11 as equivalent .",
    "note that we do not make any assumption on the set @xmath7 nor on the functions @xmath13 .",
    "we define the above problem to be _ symmetric _ and denote it by @xmath14 , if for any solution @xmath15 and for any permutation @xmath16 of the @xmath4 agents there always exists a solution @xmath17 such that @xmath18 for all @xmath19 . in other words , permuting among the agents the utilities gained from a feasible solution in a symmetric problem always results again in a feasible solution .",
    "the global or social utility @xmath20 of a solution @xmath15 is the sum of the agents utilities given by @xmath21 .",
    "the globally optimal solution @xmath22 is called _ system optimum _ , its value is given by @xmath23 .",
    "in addition to the system optimum solution we consider _ fair solutions _ , which focus on the individual utilities obtained by each agent . in this paper , we use three different notions of fairness formally defined below .",

    "clearly , this does not guarantee the uniqueness of solutions . *",
    "_ kalai - smorodinski fairness _",
    "@xcite : a drawback of maximin fairness is the fact that an agent is guaranteed a certain level of utility , thus possibly incurring a significant loss to the other agents , even though the agent would not be able to gain a substantial utility when acting on its own . in the kalai - smorodinski fairness concept",
    "we modify the notion of maximin fairness by maximizing the minimum relative to the best solution that an agent could obtain .",

    "in contrast , it should be noted that for maximin fairness and also for kalai - smorodinski fairness schemes , there may exist several different fair solutions . in the literature",
    ", these two maximin concepts are sometimes extended to a lexicographic maximin principle ( i.e.  among all maximin solutions , maximize the second lowest utility value , and so on ) which still does not guarantee uniqueness of solutions .",

    "<S> in this paper we study the problem of allocating a scarce resource among several players ( or agents ) . a central decision maker wants to maximize the total utility of all agents . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a solution may be unfair for one or more agents in the sense that it can be achieved through a very unbalanced allocation of the resource . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand fair / balanced allocations may be far from optimal from a central point of view . </S>",
    "<S> so , in this paper we are interested in assessing the quality of fair solutions , i.e.  in measuring the system efficiency loss under a fair allocation compared to the one that maximizes the sum of agents utilities . </S>",
    "<S> this indicator is usually called the _ price of fairness _ and we study it under three different definitions of fairness , namely maximin , kalai - smorodinski and proportional fairness .    </S>",
    "<S> our results are of two different types . </S>",
    "<S> we first formalize a number of properties holding for any general multi - agent problem without any special assumption on the agents utilities . </S>",
    "<S> then we introduce an allocation problem , where each agent can consume the resource in given discrete quantities ( items ) . in this case the maximization of the total utility is given by a subset sum problem . for the resulting _ fair subset sum problem _ , in the case of two agents , we provide upper and lower bounds on the price of fairness as functions of an upper bound on the items size .    </S>",
