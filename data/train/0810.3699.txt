    "it doubles the number of particles and is able to address several open questions in the standard model .",
    "the supersymmetric model msugra is widely used due to its small number of free parameters : the common scalar mass @xmath3 , the common gaugino mass @xmath4 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets @xmath5 , the common trilinear coupling @xmath6 and the sign of @xmath7 , where @xmath7 is the higgs mixing parameter .",
    "charginos @xmath8 and neutralinos @xmath9 are the mixed mass eigenstates of the superpartners of the gauge and higgs bosons .    at the tevatron",
    "associated pairs of @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be produced in @xmath1 collisions with reasonable cross section .",
    "the leptonic decay of @xmath12 and @xmath13 via off - shell @xmath14 , @xmath15 boson or on- or off - shell sleptons @xmath16 as intermediate states is a promising search channel at hadron colliders .",
    "the signature is three leptons and missing transverse energy from the weakly interacting lsp s @xmath17 and the neutrino , which are not detectable",
    "we identify electrons and muons ; `` loose '' electrons or muons need to satisfy weaker requirements than `` tight '' ones .",
    "isolated tracks are used to indicate the hadronic decay of the @xmath18 lepton to one charged particle . based on the type of the selected analysis objects we define five analysis channels : channels with three leptons @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and channels with two leptons and an isolated track @xmath22 , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 refer to a tight lepton , a loose lepton or an isolated track respectively .",
    "lepton @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) thresholds are documented in table  [ tab : cats ] .",
    "several standard model processes can mimic the trilepton signature with three leptons or two leptons and one isolated track .",
    "we remove backgrounds with on - shell z boson by requiring that the invariant mass of the two opposite charged lepton - lepton or lepton - track pairs be between @xmath29 and @xmath30 and above a minimum invariant mass of @xmath31 , @xmath32 to suppress drell - yan background and background from @xmath33 and @xmath34 resonances",

    "the rate for an additional isolated track is measured in data and applied to monte carlo events ; the number of events with one fake lepton is measured in data .",

    "the reach of this analysis is different for these regions since the branching ratio of @xmath52 into three leptons has a strong dependence on the dominant decay channel@xcite . as the decay via sleptons always leads to leptons",
    "the highest limit on the chargino mass can be set in the region where this decay is dominant .",
