    "standard quantum theory is based on a complex hilbert space : density matrices , observables and reversible transformations are all represented by linear operators on such a space .",
    "however , it has been known since the early days of quantum mechanics that many features of the theory are shared by two alternative , hypothetical theories , in which the complex hilbert space is replaced by either a real or a quaternionic hilbert space .",
    "for example , in their analysis of the logical structure of quantum theory in 1936 , birkhoff and von neumann noted explicitly that their postulates , which were intended to capture this logical structure , would be satisfied just as well by the real and quaternionic models as by the standard complex theory @xcite . to be sure , from an empirical point of view",
    "there has hardly been any contest among these three theories : the complex version has survived every test , and no experiment has been done that requires either the real theory or the quaternionic theory for its explanation .",
    "nevertheless , over the years researchers have sought a more fundamental understanding  not merely an empirical understanding  of the origin of the complex structure @xcite .",
    "one avenue of investigation along these lines was carried out around 1960 by stueckelberg @xcite .",
    "he began with the representation of probabilities as squares of real amplitudes , treating this step as a natural generalization of ordinary probability theory .",
    "he felt that one needed to explain the complex structure somehow , starting from a real hilbert space . in order to provide such an explanation he imposed the requirement that the theory admit an uncertainty principle of a specific form .",
    "this requirement led him to introduce a special operator @xmath3 to be used in the expression of the uncertainty principle .",
    "the operator @xmath3 has the property that its square is the negative of the identity operator , and the uncertainty principle then holds if one requires every observable to commute with @xmath3 . with this restriction on the observables ,",
    "the theory becomes equivalent to standard complex quantum theory , with stueckelberg s special operator playing the role of the complex number @xmath4 .",
    "we will say that a real operator satisfies `` stueckelberg s rule '' if it commutes with @xmath3 .    in the present paper",
    "we take the real - vector - space theory seriously as a potential theory of nature and , like stueckelberg , we consider the possibility that the complex structure is somehow to be located or embedded in the real theory .",
    "however , we do not want simply to impose stueckelberg s rule .",
    "rather , we ask whether the complex structure might emerge dynamically in a particular model .",
    "to get started we recall how one can express in real - vector - space terms the basic structure of quantum theory with a finite - dimensional state space .",
    "the finite - dimensional case requires a step that is not needed in the infinite - dimensional case : we have to double the hilbert - space dimension .",
    "that is , to model an ordinary quantum system with a @xmath5-dimensional state space , we need a real hilbert space of @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "suppose , for example , that one wants to describe only the spin of a spin-1/2 particle .",
    "a real state vector in a two - dimensional state space is clearly inadequate . to get all the allowed quantum states",
    ", one needs to double the dimension to four .",
    "but a four - dimensional real vector space is not the same as a two - dimensional complex space : one needs three real numbers to specify a rank - one projection operator ( a pure state ) in the real space but only two real numbers to specify such an operator in the complex space ( these could be the two angular coordinates of the bloch sphere ) . in order to restrict the set of states ,",
    "one can impose a version of stueckelberg s rule , .",
    "] namely , that all density matrices commute with the matrix @xmath7 which has the property that @xmath8 .",
    "( we find it convenient to use the symbol @xmath3 for the @xmath9 matrix rather than for the larger matrix as in stueckelberg s papers or in the mathematical literature on complex structures . )",
    "as we will see in section ii , the theory that results from applying this restriction not only to states but also to measurements and transformations is equivalent to standard quantum theory for this system , and a similar result holds for any other system , regardless of the dimension of the state space .",
    "one always needs to double the dimension in order for the real - vector - space theory to be able to accommodate all the states and operations of the complex theory , and then one needs to impose a restriction so as to limit the sets of states and operations in the right way .",
    "now , doubling the dimension corresponds to adding to the system a single binary quantum object .",
    "so we can say that the spin of a spin-1/2 particle , that is , a qubit , is equivalent to a binary real - vector - space object ",
    "a rebit  together with an auxiliary rebit , such that the whole system obeys stueckelberg s rule .",
    "one might initially think , then , that to describe the spins of @xmath10 spin-1/2 particles , one would need , in addition to the @xmath10 basic rebits , another @xmath10 auxiliary rebits to turn them all into qubits .",
    "but it is clear that this is not the case ; a single auxiliary rebit is sufficient for the whole system , because it is all that is needed to double the dimension .",
    "this fact has been noted by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been shown how one could simulate an @xmath10-qubit quantum computation by a real - vector - space quantum computation involving only @xmath11 rebits @xcite .",
    "we are thus led to consider the following model .",
    "every system is to be described as a quantum object in a real vector space , with the same dimension it would normally have in the complex theory , and in addition , there is a single auxiliary rebit .",
    "we call this auxiliary rebit the universal rebit , or ubit , because in this model it needs to be able to interact with every object in the world . by invoking stueckelberg s rule ,",
    "we could , not surprisingly , make our model equivalent to standard quantum theory , as we will show in section ii . and",
    "@xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the usual pauli matrix .",
    "addition and multiplication of the resulting @xmath14 matrices on the two - ubit space are then equivalent to the addition and multiplication of quaternions .",
    "a thorough development of quaternionic quantum theory can be found in ref .",
    "] however , as we have said , in this paper we want to take a different tack : we ask whether we can arrive at ordinary quantum theory , or an approximation to ordinary quantum theory , _ without _ invoking stueckelberg s rule .",
    "if the ubit is interacting with everything , then no local observer will be able to control its interactions with distant objects .",
    "it is conceivable that this uncontrollability could lead to an _ effective _ theory that approximates ordinary quantum theory , even though the underlying theory is the real - vector - space theory .",
    "whether such an approximation is possible is the question with which we begin our investigation .",
    "one finds that with no further assumptions , a random interaction between the ubit and a large environment does not reproduce standard quantum theory .",
    "rather , the ubit quickly factors out of the system and becomes irrelevant , and one is left with ordinary real - vector - space quantum theory with no ubit , a theory that is in serious conflict with experiment .",
    "however , the results we present in this paper indicate that if the ubit is _ rotating _ sufficiently rapidly in its two - dimensional real vector space ( rotation is the only internal dynamics possible for this simple system ) , then one does recover an effective theory that is very much like ordinary quantum theory .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to begin to discern the features of this effective theory .",
    "one feature we might expect to see , and we do indeed see , is that an isolated system can undergo spontaneous decoherence with an associated increase in entropy , even when no decoherence would be predicted by standard quantum theory .",
    "one expects such decoherence because , although the system may be isolated in the sense that it does not experience any ordinary interactions , the ubit is never isolated and can therefore serve as a conduit of information to the rest of the world .",
    "it may seem quite fanciful to imagine a special rebit with no particular location , associated with the universe as a whole . indeed in this paper",
    "we are not prepared to offer any interpretation of this object beyond what the mathematics implies .",
    "but we note that ordinary quantum theory does have a feature that is something like the ubit . for a quantum system with definite energy @xmath15 ,",
    "even if it is a spatially extended system with many parts , the time dependence of the schrdinger wavefunction is expressed in an overall factor @xmath16 multiplying the rest of the wavefunction .",
    "it is interesting that there is only one such time - dependent phase factor for the whole system , not one for each part .",
    "( each part may not have a definite energy of its own . )",
    "moreover the phase factor does represent a rotation in a certain two - dimensional real vector space , namely , the complex plane . in our real - vector - space model",
    "there is no phase factor , but in its place there is the ubit , with its own internal dynamics ( that is , the rotation ) and its own interactions with other systems .    one might worry that our model is immediately suspect in that it seems to allow instantaneous communication over an arbitrary distance : a sender alice could allow her particle @xmath17 to interact with the ubit , which immediately interacts with particle @xmath18 in a distant galaxy , delivering alice s message to bob ( who has somehow managed to be there ) . in this paper , though , we focus particularly on a limiting case in which it seems that such instantaneous communication can not occur",
    ". there are three relevant frequency scales in the model : ( i ) the rotation rate of the ubit , ( ii ) the typical strength of interaction between the ubit and the large environment , and ( iii ) the typical frequency scale of the local dynamics .",
    "we focus our attention on the case in which the first two of these frequency scales approach infinity with a fixed ratio , while the third remains finite . in this limit",
    "we use a heuristic argument to obtain a reduced dynamics of the local system . under our reduced dynamics",
    "we automatically recover stueckelberg s rule for the states and transformations , which we show prevents instantaneous signaling through the ubit .",
    "the ratio between the strength @xmath1 of the ubit s interaction with the environment and the ubit s rotation rate @xmath2 serves as a single parameter that characterizes the effective theory .",
    "when that ratio is zero , our results indicate that one recovers ordinary quantum theory .",
    "our primary interest in this paper is the case when the ratio is small but not zero .",
    "though our model does not allow instantaneous communication under the conditions we consider , the model itself is manifestly nonlocal and quite contrary to the spirit of special relativity ( not to mention general relativity ) . at any given value of the universal time coordinate",
    ", the ubit undergoes the same change everywhere .",
    "one can imagine making the interactions local by replacing the ubit with a `` ubit field . ''",
    "it is interesting to ask whether such a change would ruin the partial agreement we will find with standard quantum theory . as we will see",
    ", it is important in our model that the ubit be interacting with a large environment . over any short time interval , a _ ubit field _ at a given location would interact with an environment of limited extent , so the `` beneficial '' environmental effects that we rely on would also be limited .",
    "we do not explore this question in the present paper but confine our attention to the simple model with a single , binary ubit . despite the underlying nonlocality",
    ", the fact that we can get an effective theory displaying only local interactions makes it seem worth exploring the model to see where it leads .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we specify what we mean by `` real - vector - space quantum theory , '' and we demonstrate the equivalence with ordinary quantum theory when stueckelberg s rule is imposed with no further restrictions .",
    "( we do not impose stueckelberg s rule in the later sections . ) in section iii we investigate , numerically and analytically , the dynamics of the ubit interacting randomly with an environment .",
    "we find , among other things , that any component of the ubit state that fails to commute with @xmath3 quickly decays .",
    "our next step is to restrict our attention to the limiting case described above in which this decay happens instantaneously and continually . in section",
    "iv we consider one specific physical example , the spin of a spin-1/2 particle precessing in a magnetic field , and we explore its behavior numerically when the problem is recast in the ubit model .",
    "we identify three ways in which this behavior deviates from standard quantum theory : ( i ) the frequency of precession is reduced ; ( ii ) there is a long - term dephasing ( mentioned above ) ; ( iii ) there is a periodic variation in the _ purity _ of the spin state , indicating that the spin is periodically becoming correlated and then uncorrelated with the environment . in section",
    "v we explain all these effects analytically using perturbation theory , taking the ratio @xmath19 as our small parameter .",
    "we find , though , that at least to second order in this parameter we can eliminate the strange oscillation in purity simply by reinterpreting the theory .",
    "the reinterpretation  which does not eliminate either the reduction in precession frequency or the decoherence  is presented in section vi .",
    "we consider in that section systems with higher state - space dimension than a spin-1/2 particle , but in this paper we do not analyze the higher - dimensional case in detail .",
    "section vii focuses on the fact that in the ubit model there is not a unique mapping from the complex theory to the real theory .",
    "the choice of mapping amounts to an additional specification of the dynamics beyond what is determined by the hamiltonian .",
    "it turns out that one particular choice would render the retardation in the evolution unobservable  it would slow all processes by the same factor  leaving only the decoherence as a potentially observable effect of the ubit model .",
    "we discuss our results and draw conclusions in section viii .",
    "one can identify four main components of the basic framework of standard quantum theory in a complex vector space : ( i ) states are represented by positive semi - definite operators with unit trace ( density matrices ) .",
    "( ii ) a reversible evolution is represented by a unitary transformation .",
    "( iii ) an ideal repeatable measurement is represented by a set of orthogonal projection operators @xmath20 , such that the probability of the outcome @xmath4 when the state is @xmath21 is @xmath22 , and when outcome @xmath4 occurs , the final state of the system is proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "( iv ) the state space of a composite system is the tensor product of the state spaces of the components .",
    "other kinds of evolution and measurement are certainly possible , but they can be derived from the above kind by applying these rules to a larger system and then considering the effects on a subsystem .",
    "the analogous statements for real - vector - space quantum theory are exactly the same , except that all the operators are real . in particular this",
    "means that a reversible evolution is represented by an _",
    "orthogonal _ transformation , which is the real version of a unitary transformation .",
    "let us now write down the differential equation governing the evolution of a state in real - vector - space quantum theory .",
    "in the usual complex theory , we can write the equation of evolution as @xmath24.\\ ] ] in the real - vector - space theory there is no direct analogue of the hamiltonian @xmath25 , but we can replace the antihermitian operator @xmath26 with an _ antisymmetric _ real operator @xmath27 , so that the evolution equation becomes @xmath28.\\ ] ] we will call the operator @xmath27 the `` stueckelbergian '' of the system . if the stueckelbergian is constant , as we will always assume in this paper , then the general solution of eq .",
    "( [ diffeq ] ) is @xmath29 as @xmath27 is antisymmetric , the operator @xmath30 is orthogonal .",
    "we now show how one can recover standard quantum theory from the real - vector - space version by adding the ubit and imposing stueckelberg s rule .",
    "much of what follows in this section ( minus the interpretation in terms of a ubit ) is similar to the account given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "suppose the system we want to describe has a @xmath5-dimensional ( complex ) hilbert space .",
    "then we start by considering a @xmath5-dimensional real - vector - space object @xmath17 together with the ubit @xmath31 .",
    "consider any matrix @xmath32 that might apply to the @xmath33 system , whether it be a density matrix , an orthogonal evolution operator or antisymmetric stueckelbergian , or the projection operator associated with a measurement outcome .",
    "the @xmath34 matrix @xmath32 can be written as @xmath35 where each @xmath36 is a real @xmath37 matrix and the subscripts `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' refer to a pair of orthogonal basis vectors in the ubit s two - dimensional space .",
    "we now impose stueckelberg s rule : we insist that @xmath32 commute with @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the @xmath9 matrix we mentioned in the introduction and @xmath40 is the @xmath37 identity .",
    "( we include the alphabetic subscripts to indicate which system the operator acts on . )",
    "that is , we insist that @xmath41 which implies that @xmath42 and @xmath43 . thus we can write @xmath44    we can map any such matrix into a smaller , @xmath37 complex matrix , such that under this mapping , the laws of real - vector - space quantum theory become the laws of complex - vector - space quantum theory . the mapping is this : for a matrix @xmath32 representing an orthogonal transformation , a stueckelbergian , or a projection operator , we have @xmath45 and for a density matrix @xmath21 , we have @xmath46 the special rule for density matrices is simply to make sure every real or complex density matrix has unit trace .",
    "note that @xmath47 must be an antisymmetric matrix in order that @xmath21 be symmetric .",
    "this implies that @xmath48 , since @xmath47 is traceless .",
    "one can verify that eq .",
    "( [ mapping1 ] ) faithfully preserves matrix multiplication : if @xmath49 and @xmath50 , then @xmath51 .",
    "moreover eqs .",
    "( [ mapping1 ] ) and ( [ mapping2 ] ) together preserve the trace of a density matrix times a projection operator : if @xmath52 and @xmath53 , then @xmath54 .",
    "these two facts guarantee that the real - vector - space laws ( restricted by stueckelberg s rule ) are equivalent to the complex - vector - space laws under this mapping .",
    "( [ mapping1 ] ) and ( [ mapping2 ] ) show how to convert real matrices that satisfy stueckelberg s rule into complex matrices .",
    "one can just as easily go the other way around .",
    "for example , given a complex hamiltonian @xmath25 , we can write the corresponding stueckelbergian @xmath27 as @xmath55 given a complex density matrix @xmath56 , one obtains the corresponding real density matrix @xmath21 by performing a similar operation:$ ] , where @xmath57 is the imaginary pauli matrix and the bar indicates complex conjugation .",
    "this form is an extension of the general prescription given in ref .",
    "@xcite for bringing a reference frame into the quantum description . in this case",
    "the ubit would be the reference frame .",
    "we do not use this formulation here because we want to emphasize the possibility of treating the ubit as a rebit rather than as a qubit . for a rebit , we can not have @xmath58 as possible states along with the states @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which we will need . ]",
    "@xmath61 note that in this real - vector - space setting , under the restriction that @xmath21 commute with @xmath38 , no system is described by a state vector .",
    "in fact the purity @xmath62 can not be greater than @xmath63 : from eq .",
    "( [ complextoreal ] ) , we have @xmath64 =   ( 1/2 ) \\hbox{tr}\\,\\sigma^2 \\le 1/2 $ ] .",
    "thus every state has to be represented by a density matrix , even if it corresponds to a pure state in standard quantum theory , and the minimum rank of any density matrix is two .",
    "of course the requirement that operators commute with @xmath38 is crucial here . without this restriction",
    ", one could indeed have a state vector in the real - vector - space theory  in a sense such a state would be purer than any pure state in standard quantum theory . also note that a general orthogonal matrix in @xmath6 dimensions can be characterized by @xmath65 real parameters , whereas a unitary matrix in @xmath5 dimensions requires only @xmath66 real parameters .",
    "so hardly any of those orthogonal matrices correspond to unitary matrices .",
    "this is one sense in which the unrestricted real - vector - space theory allows too many possibilities . in the following sections we will not impose stueckelberg s rule but",
    "will try to achieve its effects in another way .",
    "it is useful to note that , in the absence of any restrictions , every real matrix @xmath32 acting on the @xmath33 system can be broken uniquely into two parts @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which respectively commute and anticommute with @xmath38 .",
    "we can write the two parts as @xmath69\\ ] ] and @xmath70.\\ ] ] in these terms one can see , for example , that if all observables and transformations commute with @xmath38 , then the anticommuting part of a density matrix , @xmath71 , can have no observable effects .",
    "let an initial density matrix @xmath21 be transformed by an orthogonal transformation @xmath72 and then tested for a property represented by the projection operator @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath72 and @xmath73 commute with @xmath38 , then the contribution from @xmath71 to the probability of the `` yes '' outcome is @xmath74 o^t \\right\\}= 0.\\ ] ] ( in the second term inside the trace , we can move one factor of @xmath38 through @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath75 so that it combines with the other factor of @xmath38 to yield @xmath76 .",
    "the two terms then cancel . )",
    "thus if we impose stueckelberg s rule on all observables and transformations , the physical predictions of the theory will not depend on whether we also impose this restriction on the set of allowed states .",
    "ultimately we want to consider a system @xmath17 interacting with the ubit @xmath31 , which is also interacting with an environment @xmath15 ( but there will be no direct interaction between @xmath17 and the environment ) .",
    "we will take the stueckelbergian of the entire system to be of the form @xmath77 where the subscripts again indicate the system on which each operator acts and we use a hat ( rather than the subscript @xmath78 ) to distinguish those operators that act on the entire system .",
    "the operator @xmath39 generates rotations of the ubit , so @xmath2 is the ubit s rotation rate .",
    "the operator @xmath79 characterizes both the interaction of the ubit with the environment and the internal dynamics of the environment itself , and @xmath80 determines the scale of these interactions . finally the operator @xmath81 is the local stueckelbergian , the one part of @xmath82 that we imagine can be controlled by an observer .",
    "this last part deserves some discussion .",
    "the ubit is not localized , but we are assuming that it is available to be manipulated and measured by any observer",
    ". that is , our local observer ",
    "whom we will call alice  can arrange for the implementation of an arbitrary stueckelbergian @xmath81 involving the ubit and the local real - vector - space object @xmath17 and can measure any observable on the @xmath33 system .",
    "one might worry that different physical systems all over the universe will be competing to achieve contradictory effects on the same ubit .",
    "indeed we will see that something along these lines does happen .",
    "it will turn out that the interaction of the ubit with the environment severely limits what alice will actually be able to do .",
    "however , we do not impose any such restriction in the basic model .",
    "we now describe our method of generating the matrix @xmath79 .",
    "one could reasonably model the environment as a collection of , say , rebits or higher - dimensional objects , each having some random interaction with the ubit but no interaction with each other .",
    "when we do our numerical experiments , we would like each run to be reasonably reproducible , as it would be for a very large environment ; so we want @xmath79 to include as many randomly chosen parameters as possible without having to make the environment s dimension intractably large .",
    "we therefore model the environment as a single system , with the matrix @xmath79 simply chosen at random .",
    "more precisely , taking @xmath83 to be the hilbert space dimension of the environment , we create a @xmath84 matrix @xmath85 , each component chosen uniformly between @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which we then antisymmetrize and multiply by @xmath88 .",
    "the factor @xmath89 guarantees that the typical size of an eigenvalue of @xmath79 will not depend on @xmath83 .",
    "the factor @xmath90 has been inserted for later convenience .",
    "thus @xmath91 .",
    "we assume that this matrix is written in a tensor - product basis of the environment and the ubit , with the ubit basis being such that the @xmath39 of eq .",
    "( [ wholes ] ) has the standard form given in eq .",
    "( [ oneone ] ) .",
    "( a mere rotation of the ubit basis does not change @xmath39 , but @xmath39 would pick up a minus sign under a reflection . ) for most of our numerical runs the environment dimension @xmath83 is 200 .",
    "to get some insight into how the @xmath78 system will evolve , in the following two subsections we restrict our attention to the simple case in which the system @xmath17 has no dynamics of its own and is not interacting with the ubit .",
    "that is , the local stueckelbergian @xmath81 is zero , so that @xmath92 , where @xmath93 .",
    "we also assume that alice has prepared the @xmath33 system in an initial state that is uncorrelated with the environment , so that the initial state of the whole system is of the form @xmath94 the state @xmath95 , which could be pure because we are not imposing stueckelberg s rule , and which may exhibit entanglement between the ubit and the @xmath17 system , can always be written as @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the usual pauli matrices acting on the ubit s space and the @xmath99 s are operators on @xmath17 s space . with @xmath81 being zero , the matrices @xmath100 will not change .",
    "that is , at a later time @xmath101 , when the state of the whole system is @xmath102 , the state of the @xmath33 system will be of the form @xmath103 ( the `` @xmath104 '' part will not change , since @xmath104 commutes with the stueckelbergian . )",
    "our aim here is to follow the evolution of the ubit matrices @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the evolution of these matrices will depend to some extent on the initial state @xmath107 of the environment .",
    "numerically we have tried both a randomly chosen pure state and the completely mixed state , and we have found that for a sufficiently large dimension of the environment s hilbert space , the results are almost the same in both cases though they tend to be somewhat smoother in the latter case . for simplicity , then , in all of our calculations we will choose the initial environment state to be the completely mixed state @xmath108 .    under these assumptions ,",
    "our numerical results can be summarized as follows .",
    "the function @xmath109 is of the form @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is an initially oscillating function that finally approaches a constant value between zero and one .",
    "thus the @xmath39 part of the state diminishes but does not disappear . on the other hand , the functions @xmath112 and",
    "@xmath106 both become linear combinations of @xmath97 and @xmath98 whose coefficient vectors rotate in the @xmath13-@xmath113 plane and finally decay to zero ( at least to a very good approximation , which we expect will be exact in the limit of an infinite - dimensional environment ) .",
    "the rotation of the coefficient vectors is simply a manifestation of the rotation of the ubit in its two - dimensional real state space . that @xmath112 and @xmath106 decay to zero tells us that the state of the @xmath33 system eventually obeys stueckelberg s rule , since the remaining operators @xmath104 and @xmath39 commute with @xmath39 .",

    "that is , the vectors @xmath129 are the eigenvectors of @xmath131 , and the vectors @xmath130 are the eigenvectors of @xmath132 .",
    "thus @xmath133 is zero if @xmath134 but @xmath135 is typically nonzero .    before proceeding ,",

    "finally , one might wonder whether it really makes sense to assume , as we have done , that the parameter @xmath1 , which is the size of a typical eigenvalue of @xmath253 , is much larger in magnitude than the spread in eigenvalues of the local stueckelbergian .",
    "after all , the idea underlying our model is that the ubit s interaction with each component of the rest of the world should be similar to its interaction with the local system .",

    "while a light pulse is reflecting off a mirror , for example , it is temporarily correlated with electrons in the mirror s silver coating , but once the reflection is complete the correlation has been undone and the pulse s state is , in the ideal case , as pure as it was before the reflection .",

    "one might wonder whether under some circumstances the correlation between the @xmath33 system and the environment might become so thoroughly mixed up within the environment that it could never be undone , in which case the entropy of the @xmath33 system would have increased permanently .",
    "this seems to be what happens after many cycles of precession  we eventually get the decoherence observed in subsection iv.c .",
    "but can the information get lost even when the spin is not precessing ? to investigate this question , we have run simulations in which , after a quarter - cycle of precession , we turned off the local stueckelbergian @xmath81 and allowed the ubit and environment to continue to evolve according to @xmath210 for thousands of precession periods while the @xmath33 system remained `` frozen '' along the @xmath292 axis .",

    "it is clear that the precession axis , that is , the axis along which the magnetic field vector lies , plays a special role . in the ubit model , it turns out that there is a second special axis : it is the axis that in the complex theory is associated with the purely imaginary pauli matrix .",
    "( the standard convention , which we are using , is to call this axis the @xmath292 axis . )",
    "the specialness of this second axis has not been evident in the numerical experiments described above , because in those experiments the precession axis has always been the @xmath276 axis , whose pauli matrix @xmath113 is purely real .",
    "in fact the results of those experiments would be essentially unchanged if we were to choose any precession axis in the @xmath305 plane , since any real linear combination of @xmath13 and @xmath113 is also real . however ,",
    "when the precession axis is the @xmath292 axis , _ all _ of the above effects disappear .",
    "there is neither a periodic nor a long - term change in the length of the bloch vector , and there is no reduction in the frequency of precession relative to standard quantum mechanics .",
    "moreover , for a precession axis intermediate between the @xmath305 plane and the @xmath292 axis , the above effects all appear but are not as large as when the precession axis is in the @xmath305 plane .",
    "consider the decoherence , for example .",
    "for an intermediate precession axis , we observe that the bloch vector again spirals into the axis of precession without changing its component along that axis .",
    "that is , we observe what in the complex theory would be called a loss of phase coherence in the energy basis .",
    "but the coherence time becomes longer as the precession axis becomes more parallel to the @xmath292 axis . in this way",

    "there is , in addition , one effect pertaining to the @xmath292 axis that has nothing to do with precession .",
    "suppose we have no magnetic field  that is , we set @xmath81 to zero  and we choose the initial state @xmath283 to be @xmath306 .",
    "that is , we try to start the spin in the positive @xmath292 direction .",
    "then one finds that over an extremely short time , the bloch vector shrinks to a shorter length ( still in the same direction ) .",
    "this is what one expects from section iii : the coefficient of @xmath39 quickly decreases by the factor @xmath182 .",
    "a bloch vector of this length is in fact even shorter than what we would get by starting the spin in the @xmath280 direction and letting it precess for a quarter cycle .",
    "as we will see in the next section , the length in the latter case is @xmath307 . in either case ,",
    "a literal reading of the ubit model would seem to say that it is impossible to prepare a pure state of spin in the @xmath292 direction .",
    "instead , we can prepare only a mixed state in that direction .",
    "if we accept this reading , the bloch sphere really is flattened into an oblate ellipsoid .",
    "states that lie beyond the boundary of this ellipsoid are simply inaccessible . in section",
    "vi we will introduce an alternative interpretation in which a pure state in the @xmath292 direction is possible , but even in this reinterpretation the predicted physics depends on which axis in space we associate with the imaginary pauli matrix @xmath57 .    evidently in the ubit model , in order to completely describe the dynamical situation of a spin-1/2 particle , one needs to specify not only the direction and strength of the magnetic field , but also the direction of the `` @xmath292 axis , '' which now becomes physically important .",
    "conceivably the experimenter would have control over this second axis , just as she has control over the magnetic field . or",
    "possibly the second axis would be beyond the experimenter s independent control ; for example , a law of nature could force a relationship between this second axis and the magnetic field axis . in the case of spin precession ,",
    "the second special axis is an axis in space .",
    "but for other physical realizations of a qubit , e.g. a two - level atom , the `` direction '' one associates with the imaginary pauli matrix @xmath57 is not a direction in space ; usually it is associated with a particular equal - magnitude superposition of the ground and excited states .",
    "moreover , we normally have a unitary symmetry that allows us to freely re - express any problem in whatever basis we choose  the choice of basis has no physical significance .",
    "however , the ubit model forces us to treat separately the real and imaginary parts of a hamiltonian or a density matrix , and this separation between real and imaginary parts could be changed simply by changing the basis . to put it in other words , for any given hamiltonian",

    "( [ newschrodinger ] ) the reduction in frequency appears as the constant @xmath423 in @xmath396 .",
    "we do not see the decoherence in this equation because it does not include third - order contributions to @xmath242 .",
    "the notion of a modified ubit raises a new question . throughout our analysis",
    "we have assumed that alice is able to build a device that implements an arbitrary stueckelbergian @xmath235 ( though as we have seen , the ubit - environment interaction can render certain components of this operator ineffective ) .",
    "however , if alice can prepare states of the form ( [ newsplit ] ) , involving the environment - ubit matrices @xmath401 and @xmath402 , one might wonder whether she also has the ability to implement a stueckelbergian of the form @xmath424 , where @xmath425 is antisymmetric and @xmath426 is symmetric . evidently she has some control over the environment , but does she have the right kind of control to be able to implement @xmath82 ?",
    "it seems likely that the correct answer is no .",
    "whereas her ability to prepare states of the form ( [ newsplit ] ) follows from our initial assumptions , we have not found a way by which she might implement this kind of stueckelbergian .",
    "moreover , the theory is self - consistent as it stands , even though alice s local stueckelbergians are linear combinations of @xmath104 and @xmath39 in the original basis , while the states she can prepare can be expressed as such linear combinations only after we have rotated the @xmath220 system by the transformation @xmath72 .",
    "indeed , alice prepares these `` exotic '' states by using `` ordinary '' stueckelbergians , relying on the interaction matrix @xmath79 to bring the environment into the picture .",
    "our modified - ubit interpretation also forces us to extend the argument of subsection iii.e showing that there can be no signaling through the ubit .",
    "if alice can prepare states involving the environment , is it possible that she could leave some mark on the environment that could be read by a second observer ?",
    "the answer is no .",
    "if the second observer does not have access to the @xmath17 system itself , then that observer s knowledge is contained in the reduced density matrix @xmath427 .",
    "for the general form given in eq .",
    "( [ generalrhohat ] ) , this partial trace is always equal to @xmath428 , regardless of what alice has done . so alice can not send a signal by this means .",
    "in our analysis of the precessing spin , we began with the hamiltonian @xmath429 and converted it into a stueckelbergian according to the prescription given in eq .",
    "( [ htos ] ) , which asks us to split @xmath25 into its real and imaginary parts .",
    "the result was @xmath430 .",
    "but for the very same physical situation , we could just as well have associated the magnetic field direction with the pauli matrix @xmath57 instead of @xmath113 , in which case the hamiltonian would have been @xmath431 and the stueckelbergian would have been @xmath432 .",
    "this latter stueckelbergian does not involve the ubit matrix @xmath39 , and this fact would have made the predictions of our model different from those we obtained in sections iv and v. in particular there would be no decoherence and no retardation of the precession .",
    "moreover we would get yet another set of results if we chose to assign to the magnetic field direction some other spin matrix such as @xmath433 .",
    "thus , as we have said before , a given hamiltonian can give rise to many distinct stueckelbergians , depending on the basis in which the hamiltonian is written .",
    "let us see how this ambiguity is expressed for an @xmath17 system with dimension @xmath5 .",
    "given a certain hamiltonian , we can imagine changing the basis first and then applying eq .",
    "( [ htos ] ) . this procedure would give us , for a specified hamiltonian @xmath25 , a stueckelbergian @xmath81 defined by @xmath434 where @xmath31 is a unitary transformation representing the change of basis .",
    "( after performing this operation , we could perform an orthogonal transformation on the @xmath17 system , but this second change of basis does not affect the real - imaginary split . ) as the dimension @xmath5 grows , this freedom opens up many new possibilities .",
    "for example , even for a set of non - interacting particles , the complex - to - real correspondence of section ii could be carried out in an entangled basis . and the predicted physics would in general be different for different choices . in the specific case of a precessing spin , our model as currently formulated implies that in addition to the magnetic field direction , an experimenter might in principle also be able to set the orientation of another physically important axis , namely , the axis with which we associate the imaginary pauli matrix @xmath57 .",
    "the angle between this second axis and the magnetic field direction would affect both the rate of precession and the decoherence rate .",
    "on the other hand , it is conceivable that if something like the ubit model does apply to our world , there could be a law of nature that restricts or determines the way in which the real - imaginary split is made , as we suggested in subsection iv.e .",
    "the simplest possibility would be that the conversion described by eq .",
    "( [ htos ] ) is required to be carried out in a basis in which the hamiltonian is real .",
    "( this law would have meaning only for an isolated system . )",
    "then the stueckelbergian would be uniquely determined by the hamiltonian ",
    "up to an orthogonal transformation on the @xmath17 system  and it would always take the form @xmath435 in this case the ubit would be playing a role very much like that of the phase factor @xmath16 for a state with definite energy @xmath15 . in the example of a precessing spin , in our alternative interpretation there would be no need to specify a second axis as in the preceding paragraph",
    ". the reduced precession frequency and the decoherence would always be just as we described them in sections iv and v , because the direction of the magnetic field would always be associated with a real spin matrix .",
    "moreover , for an @xmath17 system of arbitrary dimension , the effective hamiltonian of section vi would always have the form @xmath436 , where @xmath245 is a symmetric real matrix  there would be no imaginary part @xmath437 .",
    "one consequence is that _ all _ processes would be slowed by exactly the same factor @xmath423 , in which case the slowing would be unobservable .",
    "thus if we ( i ) adopt the modified - ubit interpretation of section vi and ( ii ) assume that eq .",
    "( [ htos ] ) is always to be applied in a basis in which the hamiltonian is real , then of the deviations from standard quantum theory we have identified , the only one that could actually be observed is the decoherence .",
    "over the years a number of researchers have taken an interest in real - vector - space quantum theory . in a paper published around the same time as stueckelberg s papers on the subject",
    ", dyson argued that when we make use of the time - reversal operator , we are implicitly basing our theory on the field of real numbers , since that operator is antilinear in the complex theory but can be expressed as a linear operator in the real theory @xcite .",

    "more recently gibbons and others have argued that the complex structure might be an emergent property associated with the emergence of a time direction @xcite .",

    "we have focused on characterizing the effective theory describing the behavior of a system consisting of the ubit and a local real - vector - space object @xmath17 . from the outset",
    "we have assumed that our local observer alice has the ability to prepare any initial state of the @xmath33 system and could build an apparatus that would implement any stueckelbergian @xmath81 .",
    "however , if both @xmath80the size of a typical eigenvalue of ubit - environment interaction  and the ubit s rotation rate @xmath2 are in effect infinitely large compared to any local frequency , then the local observer s abilities are severely constrained . assuming a large environment , the interaction between the ubit and the environment has the effect of enforcing stueckelberg s rule on the operators of the @xmath33 system .",
    "if alice tries to prepare a state @xmath95 that does not commute with @xmath38 , the noncommuting part will instantly disappear .",
    "( the noncommuting part has zero trace  so its disappearance does not entail a loss of probability . ) and if she tries to use a stueckelbergian @xmath81 that does not commute with @xmath38 , its noncommuting part will have no observable effect .",
    "note that in our model neither the state @xmath221 of the whole universe nor the full stueckelbergian @xmath82 commutes with @xmath439 .",
    "so from a global perspective the theory is quite different from standard quantum theory .",
    "it is only at the local level that we see all operators commuting with @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , this automatic enforcement of stueckelberg s rule at the local level does not cause the effective theory to be equivalent to standard quantum mechanics , because the ubit - environment interaction has other effects as well . as we have seen , the degree of divergence between the ubit model and standard quantum theory depends on how one interprets the ubit model .",
    "we have distinguished two interpretations , which we have called the literal interpretation and the modified - ubit interpretation .",
    "the literal interpretation assumes that @xmath95 is the full and correct description of the state observed by alice .",
    "if we adopt this interpretation , then in addition to losing the states and transformations that would have violated stueckelberg s rule , we also lose certain states and transformations that quantum mechanics normally allows . for example",
    ", for the spin of a spin-1/2 particle , the bloch sphere is in effect flattened into an oblate ellipsoid . except in a certain preferred plane , it is impossible to prepare a pure state of spin in any direction . in particular , in standard quantum theory",
    "there will always be one direction with which we associate a purely imaginary spin matrix ( usually called the @xmath292 direction ) .",
    "this is the direction in which , according to the literal interpretation , the purity of a spin state is the most limited .",
    "moreover , if one prepares a pure state in the favored plane and allows the spin to precess out of that plane , then the purity of the state will temporarily be diminished in order for the bloch vector to be able to fit inside the flattened sphere .",
    "one can see how the ubit model thus provides a kind of interpolation between standard complex - vector - space quantum theory and standard real - vector - space quantum theory with no ubit . in the former case",
    ", we have the full bloch sphere . in the latter case",
    ", we have a `` bloch disk , '' as all rebit states are confined to a plane . in the ubit model , in the literal interpretation , the width of the narrow axis of the flattened bloch sphere depends on the parameter @xmath293 . as this parameter gets larger  e.g .",
    ", as the ubit s rotation rate diminishes  the bloch ellipsoid becomes more flattened .",
    "indeed , when the ubit is not rotating at all , there is nothing preventing the ubit s interaction with the environment from always bringing @xmath95 to the form @xmath440 , in which case the ubit becomes inconsequential and , since @xmath441 is real , the spin is confined to the bloch disk .    however , there are good reasons to prefer the modified - ubit interpretation . in this interpretation",
    "the matrix @xmath95 does not describe what alice sees .",
    "instead , the state of alice s system is described by @xmath442 , where @xmath72 is an orthogonal transformation on the @xmath220 system . in the case of a spin-1/2 particle , in the alternative interpretation the bloch sphere",
    "is not flattened : the set of possible density matrices @xmath409 includes all the pure states on the sphere . in effect",
    "the density matrix @xmath409 includes the ghost part that would have disappeared upon simply tracing @xmath214 over the environment to get @xmath95 .",
    "it makes sense to describe alice s states in terms of @xmath409 , because this description reflects what alice is actually able to do  what states she can prepare and test for  according to our original assumptions .",
    "we have noted that though alice s actions involve the environment , they do so in a way that does not convey information .",
    "the alternative interpretation yields a greater degree of agreement between the ubit model and standard quantum theory . to second order in our parameter @xmath293 , the only difference between the two theories , with regard to the behavior of the local system ,",
    "is a factor @xmath443 multiplying the real part of the hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , we have also contemplated the possibility of a law of nature that would force the local stueckelbergian to be of the form @xmath444 , in which case the factor @xmath423 becomes a universal retardation factor and therefore unobservable .",
    "as we go to higher order in @xmath145 the correspondence breaks down further , and the ubit model will surely be very different from standard quantum theory once @xmath145 is of order unity .",
    "one difference we have been able to identify is the spontaneous decoherence , which appears as a third - order effect . for the case of a precessing qubit",
    ", we have an analytic estimate of the coherence time in our model : it is @xmath445 , where @xmath278 is the angular frequency of precession",
    ". thus experimental observations of the product @xmath446 can be used to place an upper bound on @xmath145 . a particularly high value of @xmath446",
    "was obtained recently by chou _",
    "et al . _",
    "for an optical atomic transition @xcite .",
    "these authors observed a coherence time around 10 seconds for a transition with angular frequency @xmath447s@xmath448 .",
    "this result implies that our parameter @xmath145 can not be much larger than @xmath449 .",
    "note that the slowing by the factor @xmath423 , being a second - order effect , could conceivably place a tighter bound on @xmath145 , but because of our uncertainty about the real - imaginary split , it is hard to know how to look for this slowing .",
    "again , the model we have described here is highly nonlocal , and it is interesting to ask whether we would get similar results from a local theory in which the ubit is replaced with a ubit field .",
    "( one is reminded of refs .",
    "@xcite , in which the authors show that a complex - vector - space quantum computation can be simulated _ locally _ by a real - vector - space quantum computation . )",
    "we have relied on the environment to effectively cut out the parts of the local stueckelbergian and local density matrix that do not satisfy stueckelberg s rule . in order to get this kind of environmental effect with a ubit field , we would probably need the field to be such that a change at one location would quickly bring a large part of the surrounding environment into the dynamics to create effects similar to what we have seen here .",
    "clearly the work presented here leaves many questions unanswered .",
    "it is only an initial exploration of the model .",
    "but we can at least see that the model is not in obvious conflict with observation as long as @xmath145 is sufficiently small .",
    "note that in a complete theory it should not be necessary that this parameter remain constant for all time .",
    "so the degree of deviation from standard quantum theory could conceivably be different at different stages of the universe s evolution",

    "<S> we explore a model of the world based on real - vector - space quantum theory . in our model </S>",
    "<S> the familiar complex phase appearing in quantum states is replaced by a single binary object that we call the ubit , which is not localized and which can interact with any object in the world . </S>",
    "<S> ordinary complex - vector - space quantum theory can be recovered from this model if we simply impose a certain restriction on the sets of allowed measurements and transformations ( stueckelberg s rule ) , but in this paper we try to obtain the standard theory , or a close approximation to it , _ without _ invoking such a restriction . </S>",
    "<S> we look particularly at the effective theory that applies to a subsystem when the ubit is interacting with a much larger environment . in a certain limit </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the ubit - environment interaction has the effect of enforcing stueckelberg s rule automatically , and we obtain a one - parameter family of effective theories  modifications of standard quantum theory  that all satisfy this rule . </S>",
    "<S> the one parameter is the ratio @xmath0 , where @xmath1 quantifies the strength of the ubit s interaction with the rest of the world and @xmath2 is the ubit s rotation rate . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when this parameter is small but not zero , the effective theory is similar to standard quantum theory but is characterized by spontaneous decoherence of isolated systems . </S>"
