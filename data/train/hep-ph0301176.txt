    "the top quark is the heaviest fermion in the standard model ( sm ) with a mass of @xmath2 gev @xcite . in the framework of the sm ,",
    "the couplings of the top quark are fixed by the gauge symmetry .",
    "anomalous couplings between the top quark and gauge bosons might affect the top quark production at high energies and also its decay rate .",
    "precisely measured quantities with virtual top quark contributions will yield further information regarding these couplings .",
    "since the top quark mass is so heavy , it is expected that its physics may be different from the lighter fermions and that the top quark might couple quite strongly to the electroweak symmetry breaking sector .",
    "this suggests the sm is just an effective theory and that the physics beyond the sm may be manifested through an effective lagrangian involving the top quark .",
    "the framework of effective theories , as a mean to parametrize physics beyond the sm in a model independent way , has been used recently .",
    "two cases have been consider in the literature , the decoupling case , which includes the higgs boson , and the non - decoupling case , where there is not any higgs boson .",
    "we shall consider only the first case , in which the sm is a low - energy limit of a renormalizable theory . in this approach",
    ", the effective theory parametrizes the effects at low energy of the full renormalizable theory by means of high order dimensional non - renormalizable operators @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian approach is a convenient model independent parametrization of the low - energy effects of the new physics that may show up at high energies .",
    "effective lagrangians , employed to study processes at a typical energy scale @xmath3 can be written as a power series in @xmath4 , where the scale @xmath5 is associated with the heavy particles masses of the underlying theory @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of the different terms in the effective lagrangian arise from integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom . in order to define an effective lagrangian it is necessary to specify the symmetry and the particle content of the low - energy theory . in our case",
    ", we require the effective lagrangian to be @xmath6-conserving , invariant under sm symmetry @xmath7 , and to have as fundamental fields the same ones appearing in the sm spectrum .",
    "therefore we consider a lagrangian in the form @xmath8 where the operators @xmath9 are of dimension greater than four .",
    "the aim now is to extract indirect information on the magnetic dipole moment of the top quark from lep data , specifically we use the ratios @xmath10 and @xmath11 defined by @xmath12 in the context of an effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the oblique and qcd corrections to the @xmath13 quark and hadronic @xmath14 decay widths cancel off in the ratio @xmath10 .",
    "this property makes @xmath10 very sensitive to direct corrections to the @xmath15 vertex , specially those involving the heavy top quark , while @xmath16 and @xmath11 are more sensitive to the oblique corrections .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider the following dimension six and @xmath6-conserving operators , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the quark isodoublet , @xmath19 is the up quark isosinglet , @xmath20 , @xmath13 are the family indices , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the @xmath23 and @xmath24 field strengths , respectively , and @xmath25 .",
    "we use the notation introduced by buchmller and wyler @xcite . after spontaneous symmetry breaking ,",
    "these fermionic operators generate also effective vertices proportional to the anomalous magnetic moments of quarks .",
    "the above operators for the third family give rise to the anomalous @xmath26 vertex and the unknown coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 are related with the anomalous magnetic moment of the top quark through @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the sine of the weak mixing angle .",
    "the expression for @xmath10 is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the value predicted by the sm and @xmath33 is the factor which contains the new physics contribution , and it is defined as follows @xmath34 and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the vector and axial vector couplings of the @xmath37 vertex .",
    "the contributions from new physics , eq .",
    "( [ operador ] ) , to @xmath11 and @xmath16 are of two classes .",
    "one from vertex correction to @xmath37 in the @xmath38 and the other from the oblique correction through @xmath39 in the @xmath40 . these can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is equal to zero for the operators that we are considering .",
    "we will consider the one loop contribution of the above effective operators to the @xmath15 vertex .",

    "now we have various posibilities to explore the space of the parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . using experimental values for @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61",

    ", we obtain for @xmath58 the following values @xmath77 which correspond to @xmath78  @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "therefore for these observables @xmath79  @xmath10 and @xmath11 , we get the allowed region @xmath80",
    "we are interested in studying possible deviations from the sm on the decay @xmath81 within the context of the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "several authors have been used the cleo results on radiative @xmath82 decays to set bounds on the anomalous coupling of the t - quark .",
    "we will use dimension - six operator which are full strong and electroweak gauge invariant and contribute to @xmath81 in order to bound the chromomagnetic dipole moment of the top quark .",
    "since the anomalous chromomagnetic dipole moment of the top quark appears in the top quark cross section , it is possible , due to uncertainties , to estimate the constraints that it would impose on the @xmath83 .",

    "events produced at @xmath87 gev in @xmath88 colliders , with a cut on the gluon energy of @xmath87 gev and integrated luminosity of @xmath89 , lead to a bound of @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "> from the experimental information it is possible to get a limit on the @xmath83 from tevatron . following the reference by f. del aguila @xcite and assuming that the only non - zero coupling is precisely the chromomagnetic dipole moment of the top quark , we find from the collected data that the allowed region is @xmath91 .",
    "we consider the following dimension - six , cp - conserving operators , which are @xmath92 gauge invariant @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the gluon field strength tensor and @xmath95 are the family indices .",
    "the above operator gives rise to the anomalous @xmath96 vertex and its respective unknown coefficient @xmath97 is related with the anomalous chromomagnetic moment of the top quark by @xmath98 where by means of the dimension 5 coupling to an on - shell gluon , the anomalous chromomagnetic dipole moment of the top quark is defined as @xmath99 with @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the @xmath102 coupling and generators , respectively .",

    "the total contribution of the effective operator ( [ six ] ) to the @xmath115 operator can be written as : @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "using the recent data from cleo collaboration for the branching fraction of the process @xmath119 @xcite , we get an allowed region for the anomalous chromomagnetic dipole moment of the top quark to be @xcite @xmath120",
    "our next objective is to evaluate the contribution at the one loop - level to the anomalous chromomagnetic dipole moment of the top quark in different scenarios with the gluon boson on - shell . beginning with the sm , the typical qcd correction through gluon exchange implies two different feynman diagrams . after the explicit calculation of the loops",
    ", we find that @xmath121 we note that its natural size is of the order of @xmath122 similar to the qed anomalous coupling , but now in combination with a factor @xmath123 coming from the color structure in the diagram i.e. @xmath124 with @xmath101 being the generators of @xmath125 .    the other possible contribution in the framework of the sm comes from electroweak interactions .",

    "it is worth noting that the behaviour of the curve for a large higgs boson mass indicates decoupling and that the values of @xmath83 lie within the allowed region for @xmath83 coming from @xmath128",
    ".    the contributions within a general 2hdm will be different from the sm contributions because of the presence of the virtual five physical higgs bosons which appear in any two higgs doublet model after spontaneous symmetry breaking : @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "therefore , 2hdm predictions depend on their massses and on the two mixing angles @xmath133 and @xmath134 . for small @xmath134 , the charged higgs boson contribution is suppressed due to its large mass and the small bottom quark mass .",
