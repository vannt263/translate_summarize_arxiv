    "the development of quantum - based devices is becoming increasingly necessary for future technological advances and , as a result , enormous effort is being made to find suitable experimental platforms , one of which is cold , neutral atoms .",
    "strong coupling can be viewed as an essential requirement to devise quantum networks based on neutral atoms @xcite and , until recently , free - space cavities were the most promising method for enabling an atomic system to enter this regime @xcite .",
    "very recently , kato and aoki @xcite demonstrated strong coupling for a single trapped atom and an all - fibred optical cavity based on an optical nanofibre ( onf ) spliced between two fibre bragg grating mirrors , thereby illustrating the potential offered by onfs for future quantum technological advances .",
    "+ another distinct advantage of optical nanofibres is that they facilitate the study of nonlinear phenomena in an atomic medium without requiring a tightly focussed laser beam , as in free - space optics .",
    "if light is to be tightly focussed , the interaction distance is essentially limited by the rayleigh length , @xmath0 , given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the beam radius at the narrowest point and @xmath3 is the laser wavelength . if we consider a 780 nm beam , corresponding to the d@xmath4 line in @xmath5rb , the interaction length is limited to about 4 @xmath6 m if the beam is focussed to a 1 @xmath6 m radius .",
    "onfs allow us to overcome this limitation @xcite , due to the strong evanescent field at their waist ( i.e. the thinnest region of the nanofibre ) which can contain most of the power injected into them @xcite",
    ". this evanescent field may interact with atoms in the vicinity of the fibre @xcite and spontaneously emitted light from excited atoms can preferentially couple into the nanofibre - guided modes @xcite .",
    "such properties have led , in recent years , to an explosion of interest in integrating onfs into cold atomic systems in order to fully exploit the advantages that they offer .",
    "+ in this review paper , we present a brief introduction to mode propagation in onfs and provide the reader with pertinent references in relation to the fabrication of such fibres , whether for fundamental mode or higher order mode ( hom ) propagation .",
    "next , we summarise some of the earlier onf work with atomic vapours and cold atoms , leading up to the realisation of onf - based cold atom traps and the achievement of strong coupling between a single atom and an onf - based cavity",
    ". very recent work on nonlinear optics phenomena , such as electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) and slow light using onfs with cold atoms , is then discussed .",
    "finally , we aim to provide some insight into possible future directions of the field .",
    "note that , depending on the wavelength being used , hom propagation may require the fibre waist to be larger than a micron , in which case it should be referred to as an optical microfibre ( omf ) . for clarity , we will assume that all fibres discussed in this review are submicron in diameter , i.e. onfs , unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "in the following , we derive expressions that describe the evanescent field and guided modes in a standard optical fibre .",
    "an extensive development of the mathematics presented here can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "an optical fibre can be approximated to a perfectly cylindrical , step - index fibre in which the refractive index of the core , @xmath7 , is greater than the refractive index of the cladding , @xmath8 .",
    "mathematically , the fibre is represented by the following index profile @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the core radius , @xmath11 is the radial position from the fibre centre and @xmath12 is the cladding radius as defined from the centre of the fibre .",
    "if we assume the fibre to be isotropic and source - free , maxwell s equations for light propagating within this system can be reduced to the following set of helmoltz equations @xmath13 with @xmath14 representing the transverse laplace operator in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath15 is the wave number , @xmath16 is the modal propagation constant and @xmath17 represents the @xmath18component of either the electric or magnetic field of the input light , respectively .",
    "this equation is separable into its individual components @xcite and solutions may take the form @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the radial part and the exponential term representing the azimuthal part .",
    "here @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , @xmath11 and @xmath23 denote the longitudinal , radial and azimuthal components of the field , respectively . inserting this into eq .",
    "gives @xmath24r(r)=0,\\ ] ] which is a bessel differential equation , the solutions of which are bessel functions of order @xmath25 .",
    "two cases can be distinguished depending on the sign of @xmath26 and their general solutions can be calculated to yield @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , the @xmath30 represent constants , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are bessel functions of order @xmath25 of the first and second kind , respectively , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are modified bessel functions of order @xmath25 of the first and second kind , respectively . + for confined propagation of light at the fibre s waist , the effective refractive index , @xmath35 , should be larger than the cladding s refractive index , which leads to the case @xmath36 . for @xmath37 ,",
    "@xmath33 diverges and leads to nonphysical solutions .",
    "therefore , @xmath38 and we are left with the term @xmath39 in the radial part of the field ( see eq . ) describing the exponential decay of the evanescent field at the waist of the fibre . + solving eq . for the fields in the core",
    "yields four eigenvalue equations , corresponding to the four possible guided modes inside a cylindrical optical fibre , namely the he , eh , te and tm modes .",
    "we list their analytical expressions here , without further development @xcite : + @xmath40 modes : @xmath41 @xmath42 modes : @xmath43 @xmath44 modes : @xmath45 @xmath46 modes : @xmath47 @xmath48^{1/2}. \\end{split}\\ ] ]    in these expressions , @xmath49 denotes @xmath50 .",
    "+      fabrication of an onf usually consists of heating a commercially available optical fibre , stripped of its acrylic coating , to a temperature close to the glass melting point ( for example ,  1550@xmath51c for silica ) . under these conditions",
    ", the fibre is in a plastic regime and can be elongated without breaking .",
    "as the fibre is pulled , three regions can be distinguished , as illustrated in fig.[fig : mnf ] .",
    "these are the pigtail , the taper and the waist , which , if small enough , leads to the generation of a significant evanescent field when light is launched into the fibre @xcite .",
    "several fabrication methods have been reported @xcite and the one used generally depends on one s needs , aims and resources . for cold atom experiments , the so - called _ flame - brushing technique _",
    "@xcite is usually preferred since it offers fine control over the taper shape and the waist size , two important parameters for modal selection .",
    "routinely , fibres of the order of 350 nm can be fabricated .",
    "similar advantages were recently reported using a microheater - based fibre - pulling rig @xcite .",
    "+ when light is launched into a fibre , it can couple into several of the available guided modes @xcite .",
    "light propagates differently in each of these modes , a property characterised by the modal propagation constant , @xmath16 .",
    "this difference in propagation gives rise to modal interference and may result in unwanted beam profiles at the output of the fibre .",
    "however , one can limit the number of propagating modes by reducing the dimensionless v - number , obtained from solving maxwell s equations for an optical fibre @xcite .",
    "the v - number is determined from @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the fibre waist diameter , @xmath3 is the wavelength of light , and @xmath7 , @xmath54 are the refractive indices of the fibre core and cladding , respectively . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vnum](a ) , the modal limitation is easily understood when one plots the effective refractive index , @xmath55 , versus the v - number . for a given wavelength , the v - number and , consequently , the number of allowed modes , can be reduced by decreasing the fibre diameter .",
    "this is achieved during the onf fabrication as this process consists of tapering the radius of a normal optical fibre until it reaches a few hundreds of nanometers in diameter .",

    "these losses can be minimised by ensuring that the adiabaticity criterion is met during fabrication @xcite .",
    "as stated above , light injected into an onf can couple into different fibre modes , each yielding a different propagation constant .",
    "for example , fig .",

    "the double - lobe pattern is the result of interference between the different submodes of this group . at the start of the taper region ,",
    "these modes are not in phase and consequently experience beating , which results in losses . the beat length , @xmath61 , has to be kept as short as possible compared to the taper length , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the core radius and @xmath64 is the taper angle ( see fig.[fig : adiab ] ) . in the ideal case",
    "@xmath65 ; this is achieved when the taper angle is as small as possible and , in this case , light at the taper couples entirely to a single mode .",

    "it is possible to limit propagation of the he@xmath60 mode by careful control of the pulling length and using commercially available 80 @xmath6 m diameter fibre @xcite , which has a different cladding - to - core ratio , instead of the usual 125 @xmath6 m . as plotted in fig.[fig:125v80 ] , reducing the cladding- to - core ratio shifts the adiabatic condition on the local core taper angle .",
    "this is a result of the fact that fewer modes can propagate within the cladding , thereby confining them in the core and reducing the beat length .",
    "the choice of this ratio is , therefore , crucial for hom optical nanofibre experiments .",
    "the technique was later refined by ravets _",
    "et al . _ , but for 50 @xmath6 m diameter fibres @xcite .",
    "they matched the hom adiabatic criterion even better and obtained hom propagation efficiency for the lp@xmath59 group up to 97.8@xmath67 .",
    "recently , a heat - and - pull fibre rig for ultra - high transmission of both fundamental mode and hom fibres was reported by hoffman _",
    "_ @xcite . using the same fibre - pulling rig ,",
    "the group reported observation of the spatial evolution of homs in the lp@xmath59 group , over the whole fibre length , via rayleigh scattering imaging @xcite .",
    "additionally , they were able to identify and control which submodes of the lp@xmath59 group were propagating within the omf .",
    "onfs have attracted considerable interest for particle trapping and manipulation and , more recently , for the development of quantum technologies @xcite .",
    "such fibres are particularly praised for their potential role as efficient and reliable photonic communication channels between distant quantum systems @xcite .",
    "atoms localised close to the onf s surface can emit light that couples to its guided modes @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , enhances the photon emission rate @xcite , and can be engineered to generate a lateral translation - invariant force on the atoms @xcite .",
    "the coupled photons in these modes are correlated in either a bunching or an anti - bunching fashion , as demonstrated experimentally by nayak _",
    "_ @xcite . due to the enhanced evanescent field produced at the waist ,",
    "the guided light can interact with surrounding atoms via absorption @xcite .",
    "the first experimental demonstration of this property was made in 2007 by sagu _",
    "@xcite for spectroscopy purposes .",
    "they created a cloud of cold caesium atoms in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) which was superimposed with an onf .",
    "a probe beam was then launched into the onf and its absorption measured on an avalanche photodiode ( apd ) . emitted light",
    "subsequently couples back into the fibre , the propagation direction of which is dictated by the polarisation of the initially injected light @xcite or the atoms arrangement in the immediate vicinity of the fibre @xcite .",
    "+ extensive work on in - fibre spectroscopy of hot vapours @xcite was also carried out in parallel . however , introduction of an onf in an atomic vapour often results in the atoms sticking to the onf s surface , thereby reducing its efficiency as a probing tool .",
    "several ways of dealing with this problem have been explored by the umbc group .",
    "for example , they demonstrated the desorption of rubidium atoms by launching low power , non - resonant light in the onf @xcite , or by placing it on a flange - mounted heater @xcite .",
    "they also proposed to switch to a vapour of metastable xenon atoms@xcite , since it is a noble gas and consequently does not interact as much with the fibre .",
    "they showed saturated absorption at the nw level in this system .",
    "the same group recently reported the observation of a nonlinear optical effect , eit , in a rubidium vapour @xcite .",
    "+ due to the ultra - low pressures needed in cold atom experiments in contrast to vapour experiments , the problem of atom adsorption on the nanofibre does not occur to a detrimental level .",
    "this makes the onf an excellent tool to probe and characterise atom clouds created in a mot @xcite .",
    "several experiments carried out by russell _",
    "@xcite used an onf embedded in such a system to measure the temperature of a cloud of @xmath68rb atoms using different techniques . in @xcite , temperature variations of the order of @xmath6k created by changes in the cooling - lasers alignment , intensities or detuning , were detected by comparing the fluorescence signals coupling into the onf throughout the different stages of a release - recapture process .",

    "more recently , grover _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed temperature measurements in a mot , but this time on @xmath5rb atoms .",
    "the characterisation method , although relying on fluorescence collected from an onf , used the intensity - intensity correlation function to extract the velocity of atoms surrounding the fibre and , hence , their temperature .",
    "it has also been proposed to use an onf as position sensors of trapped atoms in an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "+      the interaction of atoms with an evanescent light field has long been known @xcite . in the 1990 s ,",
    "it was proposed @xcite , and later demonstrated @xcite , that atoms could be guided inside a hollow - core fibre using the optical dipole force resulting from the interaction with the guided light .",
    "in these experiments , a laser beam , red - detuned from the average transition frequency of the d@xmath4 spectroscopic lines for @xmath68rb and @xmath5rb , was launched inside the hollow core fibre .",
    "the red - detuned light generated an attractive dipole force for atoms and they were guided inside the fibre .",
    "later , ito _ _ et al.__@xcite designed a similar experiment using blue - detuned light to repel the atoms from the fibre s inner surface and guide them along the centre of the core .",
    "+ loading atoms inside a fibre is nontrivial and , to overcome some of the obvious limitations , balykin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed trapping @xmath69cs atoms outside the onf by propagating a red - detuned laser beam in the fundamental guided mode ( i.e. he@xmath59 ) .",

    "the first term of eq . describes the dipole force , whereas the second term is the scattering force playing a central role in the initial laser cooling process .",
    "it is important to note that the dipole force depends on the gradient of the field intensity and the detuning . for negative detuning ( i.e. a red - detuned beam ) ,",
    "an atom placed in the vicinity of the onf and interacting with its evanescent field will experience a force pointing in the same direction as the gradient of intensity , i.e. towards the onf s centre . for fibres with a waist diameter",
    "roughly half the light s wavelength , this force can be balanced by the centrifugal force acting on atoms revolving around the onf and , hence , can be used to trap them .",
    "however , the number of atoms that can be trapped using this scheme is restricted to those possessing an initial angular momentum along the fibre axis within an appropriate range .",

    "@xcite proposed an improved version of the onf trap , relying on a two - colour scheme ; a red - detuned beam to attract the atoms towards the onf and a blue - detuned beam to repel and prevent them from sticking to its surface . in this case , the van der waals potential created by the fibre @xcite acts together with the red - detuned beam to attract the atoms , while the blue - detuned beam prevents them from hitting its surface .",

    ", whose frequency was scanned around the @xmath69cs d@xmath4 line , was launched into the fibre to generate fluorescence from the trapped atoms for imaging purposes ( fig.[fig : arnotrap ] ) and to provide an estimation of their number by saturated absorption .",
    "the resulting profile showed an asymmetry in the red - detuned region , which the authors attributed to a state - dependent light - shift created by the trapping beams .",
    "subsequently , the group tuned their probe beam to the stark - shifted resonant frequency and measured approximately 2000 atoms trapped around the onf .",
    "atoms trapped in this configuration showed ground state coherence times on the order of milliseconds @xcite .",
    "this trapping scheme was extended to create a conveyor belt @xcite and led to the transportation of cold caesium atoms over a few mm along the onf .",
    "_ later adapted the two - colour scheme and trapped @xmath5rb atoms@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the experiment in @xcite , they arranged the trapping beams to have linear polarisations close to the parallel configuration .",
    "they justified this choice by the fact that the cold atom cloud had a better optical depth ( od ) in this configuration , but were not able to explain the physical reason accounting for it .",
    "an even more pronounced asymmetry in the absorption profile was observed and used to estimate the number of trapped atoms .",
    "only 300 atoms were trapped in this experiment , that is 7 times less than reported in @xcite for @xmath69cs atoms .",
    "this was attributed to the difference in atomic structure between @xmath69cs and @xmath5rb , the latter being subject to larger vector light shifts .",
    "it was also proposed @xcite to use the fictitious magnetic field generated by a nanofiber - guided light field in combination with an external magnetic bias field to create trapping potentials along the waist .",
    "similar potential depths as in @xcite were reached , though in this work the power of the trapping field was an order of magnitude lower .",

    "fibre - trapped @xmath69cs atoms , using a scheme similar to that presented in @xcite , were used . as explained earlier",
    ", this scheme creates an optical lattice localised close to the waist of the onf . additionally to the trapping beams ,",
    "co - propagating probe and control beams were also launched in the onf to create the eit process ( fig.[fig : memory ] ) .",
    "this resulted in the probe pulse being stored and retrieved on demand .",
    "however , the recovery efficiency was limited to 3% . in @xcite , a retrieval efficiency as high as 10%",
    "is reported . as opposed to the experiment in @xcite , this experiment used an ensemble of cold atoms instead of trapped atoms in a fibre - based optical lattice .",
    "another difference was that only the probe beam was guided through the fibre while the control beams were in free - space .",
    "+          although onfs offer similar features to those of cavities , albeit in a more scalable manner , there is an interest to combine both in order to improve the light and matter interactions .",
    "some proposals have highlighted the advantages of creating a cavity network , in which each cavity is linked to others via fibres @xcite .",
    "le kien _ et al .",
    "_ have been studying in detail an alternative solution , consisting of onfs with a fibre - bragg - grating ( fbg ) positioned at either end of the waist @xcite .",
    "the system combines both aspects in one and demonstrates strong coupling regimes with relatively low cavity finesse .",
    "such devices could lead to improvements in the generation of eit @xcite , or entangled photons @xcite , and thus pave the way to quantum information generation and storage in an all - fibred network .",
    "these proposals are experimentally achievable as nayak _ et al . _",
    "have reported fabrication of fbg - onfs using a focussed ion beam ( fib ) milling technique @xcite ( see fig.[fig : fbgfiber ] ) .",
    "recently , a single caesium atom was trapped in a similar device @xcite and strong coupling was achieved .",
    "the trap relied on a two - colour scheme analogous to that described in @xcite , but with the red - detuned beams set at a magic wavelength in order to compensate for any light - shifts .",
    "as the atom was probed , it yielded a vacuum rabi splitting , which is a signature of strong coupling between the cavity and the atom .",
    "polarisation dependent fbgs can also be designed @xcite by creating optical nanocavities at the surface of an onf or omf via femtosecond laser ablation .",
    "+    560 nm and each slit is @xmath93150 nm wide and @xmath93100 nm deep .",
    "two neighboring slits are separated by @xmath93360 nm . reproduced from @xcite.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    our group recently proposed a design consisting of a rectangular cavity at the centre of an omf s waist@xcite .",
    "this slotted tapered optical fibre ( stof ) , depicted in fig.[fig : slotfiber ] , combines advantages from both the onf and hollow - core fibres for atom trapping .",
    "the use of a two - colour trapping scheme in this device should lead to improved interactions between atoms and guided light compared to the case of atoms trapped outside the waist of an onf .",
    "short range interactions , such as van der waals and casimir - polder effects , can easily be compensated by launching a blue - detuned beam in the stof .",
    "the fabrication methods and achieved transmissions were recently reported @xcite .",

    "as presented in this review article , the large panel of features offered by onfs makes them excellent tools for studies on cold atomic systems .",
    "their potential for the creation of an atom - photon hybrid quantum system , with the advantage of it being fibred and thereby easily networked to other systems , is also clearly evident .",
    "a great amount of work is still to be done before achieving all - fibred networks .",
    "for example , a study on rydberg atoms trapped next to onfs @xcite could lead to applications in quantum information @xcite .",
    "one could envision creating rydberg atoms within a series of slots along the waist of an optical nanofibre @xcite to form a 1d quantum network .",
    "alternatively , this system would provide an ideal testbed for exploring the quantum statistics of light in a strongly nonlinear atomic medium @xcite .",
    "+ likewise , to date very limited research has been conducted on hom propagation in optical nano- or microfibres .",
    "fibre - traps resulting from combinations of homs would lead to several distinct geometries and an overall better control over the trapped atoms positions in the vicinity of the fibre @xcite .",
    "moreover , the first set of homs , namely the lp@xmath59 group of modes , can be easily excited by launching an lg@xmath56 beam into the onf .",
    "this beam carries orbital angular momentum ( oam ) @xcite and provides extremely promising applications for atom trapping @xcite and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the details are beyond the scope of this review article and have been covered extensively elsewhere @xcite .",
    "+ another promising aspect of the atom - fibre system worth investigating is the cooperativity between atoms trapped along an onf since , due to the tight spatial confinement of the optical modes , the coupling strength per atom is increased when compared to free space beams .",
    "taking advantage of this effect qi _ et al .",
    "_ estimated that a peak squeezing of about 5 db should be attainable for a standard configuration consisting of 2500 atoms trapped 180 nm from an onf with diameter 450 nm @xcite .",
    "+ in conclusion , while the field of onfs , or even omfs , integrated into atomic systems has reached a certain level of maturity in the last couple of years there are many more aspects that still remain to be explored and the full versatility of these ultrathin optical fibres in quantum engineering remains to be discovered in what promises to be an exciting field .",

    "<S> optical nanofibres are increasingly being used in cold atom experiments due to their versatility and the clear advantages they have when developing all - fibred systems for quantum technologies . </S>",
    "<S> they provide researchers with a method of overcoming the rayleigh range for achieving high intensities in a focussed beam over a relatively long distance , and can act as a noninvasive tool for probing cold atoms . in this review article , we will briefly introduce the theory of mode propagation in an ultrathin optical fibre and highlight some of the more significant theoretical and experimental progresses to date , including the early work on atom probing , manipulation and trapping , the study of atom - dielectric surface interactions , and the more recent observation of nanofibre - mediated nonlinear optics phenomena in atomic media . the functionality of optical nanofibres in relation to the realisation of atom - photon hybrid quantum systems is also becoming more evident as some of the earlier technical challenges are surpassed and , recently , several schemes to implement optical memories have been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss some possible directions where this research field may head , in particular in relation to the use of optical nanofibres that can support higher - order modes with an associated orbital angular momentum . </S>"
