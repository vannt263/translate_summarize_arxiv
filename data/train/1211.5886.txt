    "after the first construction of the @xmath12 superconformal chern - simons theory ( scs ) based on the three algebra by bagger - lambert - gustavsson ( blg )  @xcite , an @xmath7 scs theory with u(@xmath2)@xmath1u(@xmath2 ) gauge symmetry was constructed by aharony - bergman - jafferis - maldacena ( abjm )  @xcite .",
    "the latter theory includes a large class of scs theories depending on the rank of the gauge group @xmath2 and the chern - simons level @xmath13 .",
    "this abjm theory was proposed as a low energy effective action of @xmath2 coincident m2-branes on the @xmath14 orbifold fixed point and was conjectured to be dual to type iia string theory on @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) or m - theory on @xmath17 @xmath18 in the large @xmath2 limit",
    ".    there has been significant progress in understanding the dynamics of m2-branes in m - theory by the blg and abjm theories .",
    "one direction of this progress might be obtaining solitonic objects which can be identified with m - theory branes , such as m2- and m5-branes . in the blg theory , the composite of m2- and m5-branes  @xcite , the domain wall solutions  @xcite , and some vortex - type bps configurations",
    "@xcite were obtained without and with mass - deformation and also possible bps equations were classified  @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the abjm theory , the composite of m - branes and domain wall solutions  @xcite , the vortex - type solutions  @xcite , and the classification of bps conditions of intersecting m - branes  @xcite were studied . for the vortex - type solutions in the abjm theory , @xmath19 chern - simons vortex - type bps equations  @xcite and yang - mills higgs vortex - type @xmath4 bps ones",
    "were obtained  @xcite and the existence of the corresponding vortices with @xmath4 supersymmetry was discussed  @xcite .",
    "vortex solutions in the nonrelativistic limit of the abjm theory have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as we already know , the mass - deformed blg and abjm theories have sextic bosonic potentials with the symmetric and broken vacua .",
    "in this reason , these theories can be understood as more complicated chern - simons - higgs theories .",
    "so in specific limits of the vortex - type bps equations in the blg and abjm theory , one can obtain the vortex configurations which were widely studied in abelian and non - abelian chern - simon - higgs theories  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the bps equations preserving various supersymmetries in the undeformed abjm theory were classified and the corresponding bps configurations were interpreted as known bps objects in m - theory . in this paper , we recapitulate the classification of the vortex - type bps configurations of the undeformed and mass - deformed abjm theories in terms of the number of remaining supersymmetry and su(4 ) and su(2)@xmath1su(2)@xmath1u(1 ) r - symmetries , respectively . then we reproduce the resulting bps equations by reshuffling the energy expression , thereby obtaining the bps energy bound .",
    "an unusual quantity we consider here is the stress tensor which is the spatial component of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "it has been argued @xcite from the viewpoint of supersymmetry algebra that the stress vanishes for bps configurations .",
    "we explicitly check it for the abjm theory .",
    "we will see that this can actually be a useful method to obtain consistency conditions for bps equations in case of lower supersymmetries .",
    "the main concern of the paper is to study possible solutions of the vortex - type bps equations for various supersymmetries .",
    "we have already considered the half - bps ( @xmath20 ) case in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend our analysis to less supersymmetric cases : @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "since the bps equations get complicated as the number of supersymmetries are smaller , it would not be feasible to find the most general solutions . with suitable ansatzes , however ,",
    "we show that for some @xmath23 and @xmath24 cases the equations reduce to well - known equations such as the vortex equation in the maxwell - higgs theories and chern - simons - higgs theories @xcite .",
    "we compute the energies and the angular momenta for the solutions .    for half - integer supersymmetric cases ,",
    "we show that the supersymmetries of the solutions to the bps equations in mass - deformed theory are actually enhanced to integer ones .",
    "for example , @xmath25 bps equations are shown to be identical to @xmath20 bps equations .",
    "also @xmath26 cases are enhanced to either @xmath20 or @xmath23 cases depending on the supersymmetric conditions .",
    "similarly @xmath27 bps equations are equivalent to @xmath24 bps equations .",
    "it turns out that the stress tensor is a useful quantity to show these enhancement .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the abjm theory without and with mass - deformation to fix the notation . in section 3",
    "we recapitulate the @xmath4 vortex - type bps equations obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite and consider more general bps configurations with finite energy bounds in the mass - deformed case . in sections 4 and 5 we systematically analyze the @xmath0 and @xmath19 bps equations , respectively . for the undeformed case in section 4 ,",
    "we obtain a coupled differential equation which can be reduced to either liouville- or sinh - gordon - type vortex equations in special choices of scalar functions . for the mass - deformed case",

    "we show that the @xmath29 bps equations are equivalent to those with higher integer supersymmetries .",
