    "minimum spanning tree ( mst ) is a subgraph of a weighted network that minimizes sum of the edge lengths while spanning the network and not containing any cycles .",
    "it is often used in optimization and in multivariate data analysis to visualize the key properties of a network representation of the data if the corresponding complete network could not be shown in a transparent way .",
    "many examples of the mst applications can be found in literature ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , but they are particularly common in econophysis  . frequently , a network analysis is used to described a correlation structure among a number of observables measured simultaneously .",
    "such observables are represented by nodes and correlations by the weighted edges .",
    "these weights can be expressed by any correlation measure , like , for example , the pearson coefficient or mutual information .",
    "minimum spanning tree can then be built by using the kruskal s",
    "@xcite or the prim s algorithm  @xcite provided the weights have been transformed into euclidean distances .",
    "one of the key problems that arise while dealing with empirical data is how to overcome nonstationarity .",
    "standard correlation measures , like the already mentioned ones , are highly prone to instability caused by large fluctuations of the data  @xcite and therefore results obtained with such measures are not fully reliable . inevitably , the same weakness is inherited by the networks built on top of those measures . however , as the nonstationarities are typically associated with trends , simultaneous detrending on different scales can produce stationary data .",
    "the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) is the most frequently used method in this context  @xcite .",
    "its outcome , a fluctuation function , plays the role of variance for the nonstationary signals .",
    "analogously , the role of covariance is played by the outcome of the detrended cross - correlation analysis ( dcca )  @xcite .",
    "based on both methods , the so - called detrended cross - correlation coefficient @xmath2 was introduced that is a counterpart of the pearson correlation coefficient  @xcite .",
    "it can be used in the case of nonstationary data to quantify strength of cross - correlations between detrended signals at a given time scale  @xcite .",
    "in statistical analysis , variance and covariance are not able to provide a complete description of the probability distribution function for a given data set and the whole family of statistical moments is necessary to accomplish this .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient is not sensitive to any nonlinear dependences among data . in the same manner ,",
    "dfa and dcca are used to detect power - law auto- and cross - correlations and the related fractal properties of signals , but it is impossible to use them to detect nonlinear structures that are more complex than monofractals .",
    "therefore , the detrended cross - correlation coefficient @xmath2 also has a limited power as regards the detection of higher - order statistics than a simple detrended covariance . in order to make it be more potent ,",
    "recently we have porposed its generalization called the @xmath0-dependent detrended cross - correlation coefficient @xmath1 ( @xmath3 )  @xcite .",
    "its main purpose is to identify the cross - correlations selectively with respect to the fluctuation amplitudes by amplifying the correlated fluctuations of a particular size , while suppressing the ones of other size .",
    "the @xmath1 coefficient is based on the multiscale generalizations of dfa and dcca , i.e. , the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis ( mfdfa )  @xcite and the multifractal detrended cross - correlation analysis ( mfcca )  @xcite .",
    "both these methods are principally applied to quantify multifractal structures in one or two signals , but their sensitivity to time scales make them useful to describe also the signals that are not fractal in general .    the analogy between the @xmath2 coefficient and the pearson coefficient can be exploited straightforwardly to construct the detrended minimum spanning trees  @xcite .",
    "their main advantage over the standard msts is that they are more stable with respect to time as being independent of the data nonstationarity . in our present work",
    "we want to combine this property of the detrended minimum spanning trees with the ability of @xmath1 to focus on the fluctuations of specific size . as a result",
    ", we obtain a tool that is capable of quantifying correlation structure of multivariate nonstationary signals not only with respect to time scale but also with respect to fluctuation size . as in the case of @xmath2 , the signals under study",
    "may be arbitrary , as no fractal properties are required .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sect.2 ]",
    "we provide the necessary definitions , in section  [ sect.3 ] we describe the empirical data and present results of the @xmath0mst analysis based on that data , and in section  [ sect.4 ] we collect the main conclusions .",
    "let us start from a brief description of the mfcca approach  @xcite .",
    "consider a pair of time series @xmath4 and @xmath5 divided into @xmath6 boxes of length @xmath7 ( i.e. , @xmath8 boxes starting from the opposite ends ) . in each box @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , we calculate the difference between the integrated signals and the @xmath11th - order polynomials @xmath12 fitted to these signals : @xmath13 where @xmath14 typically .",
    "the covariance and the variances of @xmath15 and @xmath16 in a box @xmath9 are defined as : @xmath17 here @xmath18 can be either @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "now we define a family of the fluctuation functions of order @xmath0  @xcite : @xmath19 |f_{xy}^2(s,\\nu)|^{q/2},\\\\ f_{zz}^q(s ) = { 1 \\over 2 m_s } \\sum_{\\nu=0}^{2 m_s - 1 } \\left[f_{zz}^2(s,\\nu)\\right]^{q/2}. \\label{eq::variance.q}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the signum function enters the equation for @xmath20 in order to preserve signs of the covariances @xmath21 that would otherwise be lost in moduli that are necessary to secure real values of @xmath20 .",
    "the real parameter @xmath0 plays the role of a filter , by amplifying or suppressing the intra - box variances and covariances in such a way that for @xmath22 only the boxes ( of size @xmath7 ) with the highest fluctuations contribute substantially to the sums while for @xmath23 only the boxes with the smallest fluctuations do that .",
    "the special case of @xmath24 allows us to reduce the above formulas to a form : @xmath25 in which all the boxes contribute to the sums with the same weights . the scale dependence of @xmath26^{1/q}$ ] and @xmath27^{1/q}$ ] can indicate a fractal character of the signals if it is power - law , but here we allow for any form of this dependence .",
    "the @xmath0-dependent detrended cross - correlation coefficient @xmath28 is defined by means of the @xmath0th order fluctuation functions  @xcite : @xmath29 for @xmath24 eq .",
    "( [ eq::rho.q ] ) reduces to the definition of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the filtering ability of @xmath28 manifests itself in such a way that the more deviated from the value @xmath24 the exponent @xmath0 is , the more extreme fluctuations in the corresponding boxes contribute to the coefficient @xmath28 . for @xmath30 , values of @xmath1 fit within the range @xmath31 as in the case of the pearson and the @xmath32 coefficient",
    ", @xmath33 indicates a perfect correlation , @xmath34 indicates independent signals , and @xmath35 indicates a perfect anticorrelation .",
    "however , for @xmath36 the coefficient @xmath1 is not bound and for independent or weakly correlated signals it may happen that @xmath37 . nevertheless , it can be demonstrated that even in this case @xmath1 can be considered a useful measure of correlations if it is replaced by @xmath38 defined as follows  @xcite : @xmath39^{-1 } & \\textrm{if } \\quad |\\rho_q(s)| > 1 .",

    "it is thus convenient to put them in a matrix of size @xmath42 that can be considered a matrix defining an @xmath40-node weighted network .",
    "similar to the pearson correlation coefficient , @xmath1 is not a metric , because it does not fulfill the triangle inequality . in the standard procedure of a minimum spanning tree construction , a matrix of the correlation coefficients",
    "is transformed into a ( metric ) distance matrix based on the formula : @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the pearson coefficient calculated for the signals",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "however , an analogous transformation using @xmath1 , @xmath45 might not produce a metric in general .    in order to test numerically",

    "next , for a given @xmath7 and @xmath0 we calculate @xmath1 for each pair of signals ( 4,950 pairs total ) and transform its value into the distance @xmath50 . then the inequality is tested for all possible distance triples ( 161,700 total ) and the exceptions are counted .",

    ", the distances always fulfill the inequality , which means that @xmath50 behaves like a metric . however , for @xmath53 the exceptions do occur indicating that the distance can not be considered a metric .",
    "we also applied the same test to randomized empirical data from a stock market ( logarithmic price fluctuations of the 100 largest american companies , the same data set that will be studied in sect .",

    "this topologic transition occurs gradually with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "filtering out the insignificant edges has no effect for @xmath59 as the tree consists of all the 100 nodes , but the effect is striking for @xmath65 where the tree is disconnected with only 50 nodes forming the main component , while the remaining nodes either form three smaller components : one with @xmath66 nodes and two with @xmath67 nodes or do not form any connections ( 40 nodes ) . from the market perspective , a centralized structure with large edge weights corresponds to a global coupling among the stocks that causes the stock prices to move collectively .",
    "their evolution can thus be described by a one - factor model . in a correlation matrix analysis",
    "this factor manifests itself as the distant largest eigenvalue and it is often called the market factor . on the other hand ,",

    "from the perspective of practical application of the @xmath0mst graphs , it is important to notice that , since their topology depends on @xmath0 , the correlation structure of the market is different if one considers different fluctuation amplitudes .",

    "it can allow one for a fine tuning of the investment portfolios , for instance , in order to avoid their composition of the stocks that tend to be more strongly correlated during volatile times , which increases the portfolio s risk , and which can remain unnoticed if one uses standard measures .",
    "for example , in the considered interval of time ( 1998 - 1999 ) for @xmath74 the shares of corning were the most closely related to the general electric ones , while for larger @xmath0s it occurs that they were even more strongly related to the aig shares , so that a simultaneous investment in both these stocks was in fact more hazardous than it might be expected from an analysis of the mst for @xmath74 .",
    "in this work we introduced a family of @xmath0-dependent minimum spanning trees that are able to visualize the cross - correlations that are restricted to a specific range of the fluctuation amplitudes .",
    "these trees are a generalization of the detrended msts proposed in  @xcite .",
    "they are defined on the basis of the @xmath0-dependent detrended cross - correlation coefficient @xmath1 by transforming it to a metric distance .",
    "we applied the technique of the @xmath0mst graphs to visualize the correlation structure of the american stock market and found that by changing the fluctuation amplitudes and time scales we are focused on , one observes substantial changes in topology of the graphs .",
    "we identified a few previously known features of the financial data like the epps effect , the division of the market into industrial sectors , presence of the so - called market factor , and the priviledged role of some specific stocks ( like general electric and cisco ) in the market structure .",
    "we noticed also that the detrended @xmath0msts can complement the coefficient @xmath1 in detection of the `` hidden '' cross - correlations that can not be observed in analyses based on the measures defined for @xmath74 , like @xmath2 and the related detrended msts .",
    "therefore , we envisage that both @xmath1 and @xmath0msts will prove helpful in portfolio analysis and , of course , also in many other areas where cross - correlations are to be extracted from nonstationary time series .",
