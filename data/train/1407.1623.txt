    "as the lhc is approaching its run - ii phase , and the experimental collaborations are rapidly progressing in the assessment and reduction of the systematic uncertainties affecting their measurements , on the theoretical side it is necessary to deliver reliable and accurate predictions for as complex reactions as possible , such as ones featuring many electroweak vector bosons , higgs bosons , and top quarks in the final state .",
    "the availability of these predictions is crucial both in searches for new physics , in order to have all sorts of standard - model ( sm ) backgrounds under very good theoretical control , and for the determination of the characteristics and quantum numbers of the recently discovered higgs boson @xcite , where rare signals may in some cases represent a particularly clean detection environment .",
    "moreover , with a wider perspective , some of the processes that can be considered rare and of challenging difficulty for the lhc setup , may instead turn out to be very well visible at the future circular hadronic collider ( fcc - hh ) , due to the foreseen increase in luminosity and centre - of - mass energy .",
    "it is thus important for this kind of studies , entailing the simulation of quite diverse hadronic reactions at various collider energies , to employ robust and flexible tools , best if based on a unique and consistent computational framework , and with no need of resorting to different codes for different types of processes .",
    "moreover , in the case of a detailed analysis of multi - particle final states , nlo qcd accuracy can turn out to be mandatory for a reliable prediction of both the normalisation and the shape of differential distributions and for the assessment of the associated theoretical uncertainties , and several classes of observables require a logarithmic resummation , like the one performed by parton showers , for a complete coverage of the phase space .",
    "the public program madgraph5_amc@nlo  @xcite is a framework that combines all of the above - mentioned elements .",
    "it allows the user to automatically simulate generic sm reactions at the nlo in qcd , matched to parton showers , starting from a minimal amount of input information ( e.g. type of process required and value of parameters ) .",
    "its generality stems from the fact that the elements specific to the particular physics process considered are generated dynamically on the basis of the physical input , and not hard - coded beforehand .",
    "the simulations of this environment are based on the tree - level - diagram generation of madgraph5  @xcite , on the nlo fks  @xcite infrared subtraction implemented in madfks  @xcite , and on the loop - diagram generation of madloop  @xcite , that in turn relies on the opp method @xcite implemented in cuttools  @xcite , and is optimised through the openloops  @xcite technique ( although the program allows to interface to third - party one - loop providers ) .",
    "its nlo matching with parton showers is achieved by means of the mc@nlo formalism @xcite , applied to all modern collinear - based monte carlo s @xcite , and its nlo multi - jet merging is based on the fxfx procedure @xcite .    in what follows",
    "i presents results , all obtained with madgraph5_amc@nlo , relative to the total cross section for various rare sm reactions at the lhc and at the fcc - hh .",
    "many of the cross sections reported here are already known in the literature at the nlo in qcd for lhc energies ( see for example section 4.1 of @xcite , and references therein ) , and have been recomputed here with the sole aim of extracting , readily and in a consistent setup , the cross - section increase ( denoted as @xmath0 in the next sections ) at the 100 tev fcc - hh with respect to the 8 tev lhc .",
    "results for the hadronic production of five electroweak vector bosons , and of a top - antitop pair in association with an electroweak vector boson and two jets are instead presented here for the first time at the nlo .",
    "this talk is structured as follows : in section [ sec : setup ] , i describe the physical setup used to generate all results ; sections [ sec : h ] , [ sec : v ] , and [ sec : t ] present predictions for processes involving multi - higgs - boson , multi - electroweak - bosons , and multi - top - quark final states , respectively ; in section [ sec : conc ] , i draw my conclusions .",
    "in this section i summarise the physical setup employed to obtain the results shown below .    *",
    "non - zero particle masses are @xmath1 gev , @xmath2 gev , @xmath3 gev , @xmath4 gev . the bottom - quark mass is set to @xmath5 gev in the four - flavour - scheme ( 4fs ) simulations , and to @xmath6 in the five - flavour - scheme ( 5fs ) ones .",
    "the ckm matrix is @xmath7 , and the fine - structure constant is @xmath8 . *",
    "renormalisation and factorisation scales are chosen as @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the transverse mass of the @xmath11-th final - state particle .",
    "independent variation of @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the range @xmath14 $ ] is obtained in an exact way without rerunning the code , through the reweighting technique described in @xcite . the uncertainty associated with this variation",
    "is shown as a dark band in the plots of the following sections .",
    "* as parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) i use the mstw 2008 nlo ( 68%  c.l . )",
    "sets @xcite , relevant to four or five active flavours , depending on the flavour scheme employed in the simulation .",
    "pdf uncertainties are estimated according to the asymmetric - hessian prescription provided by the pdf set , and obtained automatically as in explained in @xcite .",
    "they are shown as a light band in the plots of the following sections .",
    "the value and the running of the strong coupling constant @xmath15 are as well set according to the pdf set .",
    "* whenever relevant , jets are clustered by means of the anti-@xmath16 algorithm @xcite as implemented in fastjet  @xcite , with @xmath17 , and @xmath18 gev ( if not otherwise specified ) .",
    "* whenever relevant , photons are isolated by means of the frixione smooth - cone criterion @xcite , with parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 gev , @xmath21 .",
    "in table [ tab : h ] and in figures [ fig : h ] ( left panel ) and [ fig : hv ] , i display the nlo total cross section for the production of a single higgs boson in association with jets , heavy quarks and electroweak bosons , as a function of the collider centre - of - mass energy .",
    "higgs production through gluon fusion , @xmath22 , includes exact top- and bottom - mass dependence , though in a non - automated way , through an interface to the program sushi  @xcite realised by h. mantler and m. wiesemann ( in a way similar to what done for analytic transverse - momentum resummation in @xcite ) .    for most of the channels , the cross - section increase @xmath0 at 100 tev with respect to the 8 tev lhc ranges from a factor of 20 to a factor of 50 , with the exception of the @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) final states , where it is around 80 , and of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 final states , where it exceeds 250 .",
    "the remarkable growth of @xmath27 , together with its sensitivity to the sign of the top - quark yukawa coupling @xmath28 @xcite , makes this reaction a golden channel for a precise measurement of the latter .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that already at the 14 tev lhc it is possible to put loose bounds on the sign of @xmath28 , mainly with a semileptonically decaying top quark , and in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 decay channels . at the fcc - hh",
    "the situation will improve considerably , owing to the cross - section and luminosity increase .",
    "indeed , the nlo cross section for the main irreducible background to @xmath31 production , namely @xmath32 qcd production , has a growth @xmath0 comparable to that of the signal ( or even slightly smaller : about 200 times with the photon - isolation setup employed here ) , hence the significance of the signal , in comparison with the lhc , is expected to scale at least with the square root of the number of events .",
    "moreover , the sensitivity of the signal to the value of the top - quark yukawa is very similar at the fcc - hh as at the lhc , as shown explicitly in the right panel of figure [ fig : h ] .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : hh ] , taken from @xcite , shows the dominant higgs - pair - production channels .",
    "the pattern of growth is qualitatively similar to single - higgs production , with the top - associated channels displaying the largest increase .",
    "the importance of this class of processes is linked in particular to their sensitivity to potential deviations from the sm structure of the higgs self - interactions .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : hh ] , also taken from @xcite , shows interestingly that the dominant mode , namely higgs - pair production through gluon fusion , is also one of the most sensitive to the variation of the trilinear higgs coupling @xmath33 . and the related comments have just to be interpreted as a sketch : a more correct and complete study of non - standard higgs interactions would take into account all of the operators of a given canonical dimension in an effective - field - theory framework .",
    "this is of course beyond the scope of this talk . ]",
    "associated production of three higgs bosons , relevant to studies of the higgs quartic self - interaction , can also be simulated in the madgraph5_amc@nlo  framework , and will be documented elsewhere @xcite .",
    ".[tab : h ] production of a single higgs boson at the lhc and at a 100 tev fcc - hh .",
    "the rightmost column reports the ratio @xmath0 of the fcc - hh to the lhc cross sections .",
    "theoretical uncertainties are due to scale and pdf variations , respectively .",
    "monte - carlo - integration error is always smaller than theoretical uncertainties , and is not shown . for @xmath34 , on top of the transverse - momentum cut of section [ sec : setup ] , i require @xmath35 gev , @xmath36 and @xmath37 being the hardest and next - to - hardest jets , respectively .",
