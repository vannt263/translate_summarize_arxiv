    "collective modes of excitation are an universal feature of nuclei  @xcite . involving a large majority of nucleons , these modes can provide crucial insight into exotic nuclear structure . for instance , the pygmy mode is known to be a consequence of a vibration involving the neutron skin  @xcite against a core composed of neutrons and protons .",
    "originally the increase of the low - lying strength was thought to be an exclusive phenomenon of heavy nuclei with large isospin asymmetry .",

    "the next generation of rib facilities , such as fair , spiral2 or ribf , will provide a wealth of new data on nuclear structure under extreme conditions , for example in nuclei closer to the drip line .",
    "hence it is of interest to perform theoretical investigations on nuclear excitations under such conditions as extreme isospin or deformation .",
    "specifically , the present work will focus on the study the e1 response in very neutron - rich tin isotopes , from @xmath0sn ( where current experimental data stands ) up to @xmath1sn .",
    "several experimental and theoretical studies available on the less neutron - rich part of the isotopic chain already provide some information on the character of the low - lying e1 response .",
    "in general , it has been found that the low - lying e1 strength increases with neutron excess  @xcite , and that the collectivity of the excitations is rather high .",
    "tin nuclei are spherical because of the z=50 shell closure .",
    "however it is believed that for strong neutron excess ( beyond a @xmath3 140 ) , the large diffuseness of the density induces a weakening of the spin - orbit potential  @xcite , and therefore the disappearance of the shell closure , allowing for deformed nuclei .",
    "this means that in order to describe low energy excitations in these very neutron - rich nuclei , beyond @xmath0sn , a model including both pairing and deformation is required .",
    "more generally , most nuclei in the nuclear chart are deformed , which requires to investigate the interplay between the low - lying e1 strength and deformation when going towards the drip - line .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate the influence of deformation on the low - lying e1 strength for neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the recently developed  @xcite relativistic deformed qrpa approach ( rqrpaz ) , provides a viable microscopical framework where deformation and pairing correlations are included in a fully self - consistent fashion .",
    "it should also be noted that the evolution of the giant dipole resonance with respect to neutron excess and deformation has not been investigated yet in a self - consistent microscopic framework .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in the first section of this work we first very briefly recall the rhb and rqrpa formalism . in section",
    "ii we present the ground - state properties of the @xmath4sn chain of nuclei as calculated with the parameter set nl3  @xcite , and study the electric dipole response in the gdr and pdr energy regions , concentrating on the low - lying e1 strength .",
    "the last section is devoted to a brief summary and the conclusions .",
    "a detailed discussion of deformed relativistic hartree bogoliubov ( rhb ) and relativistic random phase approximation for axially deformed systems can be found in references  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively . therefore , only the basic theory will be outlined , and details given where extensions , like the inclusion of pairing at the rpa level , are specific to this work .",

    "this particular form of the non - linear potential has become standard in applications of rmf functionals , although additional non - linear interaction terms , both in the isoscalar and isovector channels , have been considered over the years  @xcite .",

    "furthermore , a study using deformed rqrpa in @xmath90mo ( @xmath91 )  @xcite shows that , at least for stable nuclei , deformation does not destroy neither the excitation pattern nor the collectivity of the pdr , but merely splits the response into different peaks for the different @xmath92 modes .    to gain insight on the geometrical nature of the low - lying excitations one has to look at the transition densities ( [ def : tddensityaxi ] ) , which are in the case of axially deformed nuclei functions depending on the two coordinates along ( @xmath93 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath94 ) to the symmetry axis .",

    "<S> the e1 strength is systematically analyzed in very neutron - rich sn nuclei , beyond @xmath0sn until @xmath1sn , within the relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the great neutron excess favors the appearance of a deformed ground state for @xmath2sn . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the low - lying strength in deformed nuclei is determined by the interplay of two factors , isospin asymmetry and deformation : while greater neutron excess increases the total low - lying strength , deformation hinders and spreads it . </S>",
    "<S> very neutron rich deformed nuclei may not be as good candidates as stable spherical nuclei like @xmath0sn for the experimental study of low - lying e1 strength . </S>"
