    "the ising model has been an important means in the study of statistical systems , since its formulation in 1925 .",
    "it is an arrangement of spins with exchange interaction , located on the sites of a lattice and which for a certain configuration of the spins has a hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the interaction coupling constants and @xmath2 is an external magnetic field .",
    "each spin interacts with its neighbors up to some range and , for chains , in order to avoid doubling , the interactions are accounted from the left to the right , i.e. the energy of a spin is taken to be the one corresponding to its interactions to its right . in general periodic boundary conditions",
    "are imposed , although for our purposes they are not necessary .",
    "the exchange interactions in ( [ energia ] ) could be of a more general form , for example biquadratic .    in an uniform configuration , translational invariance along the lattice",
    "requires that @xmath1 depend on the relative position of the lattice sites , i.e. @xmath3 , and the magnetic field is constant .",
    "these chains are invariant under inversion or parity .",
    "the study and classification of classical ground states for heisenberg chains has been pursued also for a long time @xcite . for the ising chain luttinger and tisza",
    "conjectured that it should be given by a regular lattice , formed by the repetition of an elementary block , and as quoted by karl @xcite , the minimal configuration of classical spins is the usual starting point for the quantum treatment . in this paper ,",
    "@xcite , a proof of the conjecture under certain assumptions has been given , mainly that the spin - spin interactions are parity invariant , and the proof based on the decomposition of the energy expression into several terms which are then minimized .",
    "the ground states for uniform chains with a general form of the exchange energy , have been thoroughly studied by morita @xcite , who generalized previous work @xcite and has shown that the energy of a chain can be written as the sum of energies of irreducible blocks , from which the ground states turn out .",
    "the results of morita can be seen to rely basically on translational invariance .",
    "moreover , there is a certain degree of degeneracy under ground states due to translational invariance @xcite , which puts limits on the maximum length of irreducible blocks , which is further constrained by invariance under parity transformation @xcite .    in this work",
    "we generalize morita s approach to chains which are nonuniform at short scale but uniform at large scale , i.e. they are periodic , with site dependent couplings and in general different spins .",
    "they could be used to modelate for example polymers @xcite , lattice gases @xcite and through competing interactions could arise frustration @xcite .",
    "if the period is @xmath4 , there are @xmath4 different types of atoms ( spins ) , which interact with the other spins in a translational invariant way , but with a coupling dependent on the atom type or site .",
    "thus a chain of this sort will have the form @xmath5 , where the upper index denotes the atom type , and the lower index denotes the position on the chain . further ,",
    "as the labeling is a matter of convention , if we speak on molecules , they could begin at any place in the chain , then repeating regularly .",
    "thus when we refer to molecules , we will understand substructures with this ambiguity .",
    "the exchange energy between two spins is usually given by @xmath6 where the dependence of the coupling on the type of the second spin is implicit in the dependence on its position .",
    "the function @xmath7 can be as usual bilinear , biquadratic , etc .",
    "morita has considered generalized multispin interactions of range @xmath8 , with hamiltonian @xmath9 where the function @xmath7 is translational invariant .",
    "this form can be generalized for polyatomic chains and we show that the length of irreducible blocks satisfy the same main criteria of morita .",
    "further , there is an equivalence of an irreducible block and its cyclic permutations and the length of an irreducible block is a multiple of @xmath4 . in general",
    "there is parity invariance only when the molecules are parity invariant , otherwise the highest length of irreducible blocks depends on the period , the interaction range and the spin values .",
    "morita sets limits of the maximal length of ground state blocks due to parity invariance @xcite , we give an explicit demonstration of these results .",
    "the ground states are obtained by direct energy comparison in the parameter space of the chain and we give the irreducible blocks in various examples and their ground state diagrams .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "2 we review morita s formulation @xcite , in sec .",
    "3 we give the generalization to diatomic chains with distant neighbor interactions , in sec .",
    "4 the generalization is given for polymeric chains , in sec .",
    "5 the ground state diagrams for some examples are given and in sec .",
    "6 conclusions are drawn .",
    "in this section we will consider morita s formulation for the reduction of a one - dimensional homogeneous chain @xcite with hamiltonian given by ( [ hg ] ) .",
    "morita defines `` displaceable '' blocks and by means of them the reducibility of a chain , which allows to obtain the ground states as irreducible states of minimum energy .",
    "additionally he establishes a maximal length for the irreducible states , from which regular chains are constructed .",
    "we are not going into the explicit details of morita s approach .",
    "instead , we make a formulation in different and somewhat simpler terms , which will be then generalized for multiatomic chains .",
    "take first the simplest ising chain @xmath10 with @xmath11 spins @xmath12 and next nearest neighbor interaction . in the following",
    "we will consider for simplicity bilinear hamiltonians , with constant magnetic field , although the steps done and the results do not depend on this form and are valid for the hamiltonian ( [ hg ] ) @xmath13 where in general the chain is periodic , but if it is finite , then @xmath14 for @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "if 2 adjacent spins have the same value @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 , then the energy of the chain can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 . due to translational invariance",
    "the middle term on the r.h.s does not depend on its position in the chain .",
    "this term is the energy of the spin @xmath17 in such a way that to its right there is a similar spin . in general , with the convention that the interactions of a spin are accounted to the right , the energy of a block @xmath21 whose interactions are with the @xmath8 spins of a block @xmath22 , where @xmath8 is the interaction range , will be written as @xmath23 .",
    "however we will write simply @xmath24 when @xmath22 coincides with the first @xmath8 spins of @xmath21 , or as it is explained in the following when the length of @xmath21 is less than @xmath8 .",
    "thus @xmath25 we suppose that @xmath11 is large enough in order that the contribution of the boundary terms is not relevant , although the results are in general valid also for shorter chains , with account of the boundary terms .",
    "therefore a chain of this type , with spin values @xmath12 and @xmath26 repeated spins @xmath27 , will have energy @xmath28 , where @xmath29 are the corresponding energies and the chain @xmath30 does not contain repeated spins , i.e. it is formed by blocks of up - down spins @xmath31 . thus the energy of the chain can be reduced successively to a sum of the energies of the blocks which compose it , i.e. @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of blocks @xmath31 and @xmath37 are the energies per spin , i.e. the energies divided by the number of spins of the block .",
    "note that the energy of a block @xmath38 is the same , @xmath39 .",
    "one of these three energies will be minimum in some region of parameter space , hence the configuration given by the repetition of the corresponding block will be a ground state of this chain .    for higher spin , with a number of values @xmath40 , equation ( [ mono ] ) will be now @xmath41 thus there are @xmath42 irreducible states with spin energies @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "consider now a chain with second nearest neighbor interactions , with first and second neighbor couplings @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 , its energy is also given by ( [ energia1 ] ) , but now @xmath49 .",
    "let us take in general @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "its energy is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a chain formed by @xmath55 and @xmath56 placed one after the other , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "we call irreducible a block @xmath21 , whose energy is ( [ energiab ] ) , if the regular chain @xmath60 can not be , nontrivially , reduced in the same way as ( [ energia2 ] ) . a trivial reduction would be to reduce it by the same block @xmath21 . thus if a block is irreducible , a cyclic permutation of its spins is also irreducible . consistently with it , it is easy to see that ( [ energiab ] ) is invariant under cyclic permutations of @xmath61 .",
    "hence an irreducible block can be represented by any its cyclic permutations .",
    "therefore , for @xmath62 and nearest neighbor interactions , the only irreducible blocks are : for one spin @xmath63 and @xmath64 , for two spins @xmath31 , for three spins @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and with four spins @xmath67 .    following this construction",
    ", it is straightforward to generalize reducibility for a chain @xmath68 with @xmath8-neighbor interactions .",
    "the idea is that there is a block @xmath21 in the chain , whose energy @xmath24 is the same as in a regular chain of this block , i.e. formed by repetition of itself . in this case",
    ", the energy of @xmath10 decomposes into the sum of @xmath24 plus the energy of the rest , and the rest assembles naturally into another chain and could reduce further , as in ( [ energia2 ] ) .",
    "there are two cases , for a block @xmath69 with @xmath70 spins , we must have @xmath71 where @xmath4 is the greatest integer such that @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath74 , then the chain must satisfy @xmath75 in both cases the energy is given by ( [ energia2 ] ) .",
    "these two cases are resumed by the displaceable blocks of morita @xcite , which means that there are two identical @xmath8-lenght blocks ( @xmath8-blocks ) at different places in the chain .",
    "if these blocks intersect we have ( [ c1 ] ) and in the contrary case ( [ c2 ] ) .",
    "hence the length of a reducible block must be at least @xmath76 , i.e. all blocks with length @xmath77 are irreducible .",
    "further , if a chain is long enough , there will be necessarily displaceable blocks . indeed @xcite , if the number of spin values is @xmath78 , then a chain of length @xmath79 will contain at least one displaceable block , because this chain has @xmath80 succesive @xmath8-blocks , and there are only @xmath81 different such blocks .",
    "thus the length of an irreducible block can be at most @xmath82 .",
    "however , the equivalence under cyclic permutations imposes a further restriction on these blocks ( for @xmath83 ) .",
    "indeed , a maximal length irreducible block @xmath21 can be constructed by arranging the @xmath81 different @xmath8-blocks as in the preceding case .",
    "then , cyclic equivalence allows us to set at the beginning of the block , an @xmath8-block with equal spins @xmath84 , hence the next @xmath8-block will be @xmath85 , with @xmath86 .",
    "further , there are @xmath87 @xmath8-blocks @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xmath8-blocks @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath89 of the former blocks will appear together with the last ones , as the @xmath93-blocks @xmath94 .",
    "thus the remainig @xmath8-block @xmath88 must be the last one , and by cyclicity , its @xmath95 spins @xmath96 can be located at the beginning of @xmath21 , hence there will be a block with @xmath97 equal spins , which is reducible .",
    "therefore , in order that @xmath21 is irreducible , it can not contain these @xmath95 last spins , and its length can not exceed @xmath81 .",
    "if the lattice is parity symmetric , as is the case of homogeneous lattices , the energy of an irreducible block can decompose as shown in the following , and the maximal length of irreducible blocks decreases @xcite . as seen in the previous paragraph , the condition that an irreducible block does not contain more than @xmath81 @xmath8-blocks leads to a maximal length of @xmath81 . among these @xmath8-blocks",
    ", there may be @xmath8-blocks with parity symmetry around their middle , i.e. of the form @xmath98 for @xmath8 even , and @xmath99 for @xmath8 odd , we will call these blocks @xmath100-blocks .",
    "there are @xmath101}$ ] different @xmath100-blocks , where @xmath102 $ ] is the integer part of @xmath103 .",
    "thus , if @xmath104}$ ] , there will be @xmath100-blocks @xcite .",
    "let us suppose that an irreducible block @xmath21 contains @xmath105 @xmath100-blocks .",
    "then , by means of a cyclic transformation , we can write @xmath106 , where @xmath107 are @xmath100-blocks , joined by the blocks @xmath108 .",
    "the union symbols @xmath109 take into account that the @xmath100-blocks can overlap .",
    "if @xmath110 and @xmath111 overlap , then @xmath112 must be taken in the same way as in set theory , i.e. it contains @xmath110 and @xmath111 without duplicating elements , in other words @xmath113 , where the intersection is the overlapping block and the simple product means to place one block as the continuation of the other .",
    "we will take in the following as a prescription @xmath114 , i.e. for @xmath110 we take the part of it not contained in @xmath111 . if we call @xmath115 or @xmath116 the parity transformation of a block , then @xmath117 .",
    "further , we define a new block by insertions of @xmath118 , as follows @xmath119 where @xmath120 . in the case",
    "that there is overlap , say between @xmath121 and @xmath122 , and @xmath123 is void , then there will be overlap between @xmath124 and the following @xmath121 in the first row of ( [ cadenap ] ) , given by @xmath125 , hence in this case @xmath126 then @xmath127 reduces and @xmath128 further , ( [ cadenap ] ) leads also to @xmath129 where in the case of ( [ iover ] ) , the corresponding terms in the first row will be @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , after a cyclic permutation in the last term of ( [ cadenap ] ) , we get @xmath131 .",
    "thus , if the interactions are parity symmetric then , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , i.e. , taking into account ( [ energiai ] ) , we get @xcite @xmath134 where the lengths of the blocks , i.e. their numbers of spins , satisfy @xmath135 . from the definition of @xmath124 it can be seen that their lengths are even .",
    "the sum in ( [ ei ] ) can decompose farther , if some of the blocks @xmath124 are reducible    the decomposition ( [ ei ] ) is non trivial if it contains at least two different terms , which requires @xmath136 .",
    "however , if @xmath137 and @xmath138 , then ( [ cadenap ] ) becomes @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "hence in this last case the reduction requires @xmath141 .",
    "this remains valid when @xmath142 and @xmath143 overlap .",
    "thus , the condition for @xmath21 decomposing nontrivially , i.e. ( [ ei ] ) contains at least two terms , is @xmath144}+2 $ ] .",
    "the main assumption in the previous analysis is , up to boundary terms , that the lattice is translational invariant .",
    "moreover the demonstration is facilitated by the convention that the exchange energy of a spin accounts its interactions with the spins to its right ( it could be the other way around ) .",
    "additionally , the parity invariance of the lattice reduces the maximal length of the elementary ground state blocks .",
    "therefore , the energy of a chain is the sum of the energies of irreducible blocks .",
    "a block @xmath21 is irreducible if its regular chain , @xmath60 can not be nontrivially reduced .",
    "hence the cyclic permutations of an irreducible block are equivalent . in this way all irreducible blocks can be obtained .",
    "further , if an irreducible block contains at least 2 or 3 @xmath100-blocks ( see above ) , its energy decomposes as in ( [ ei ] ) .",
    "if any of the blocks in this decomposition is reducible , it must be reduced and ( [ ei ] ) will be expressed in terms of irreducible blocks , whose maximum length is @xmath145}+2 $ ] .",
    "therefore , after a full reduction , considering ( [ ei ] ) , the energy of the chain is , up to boundary terms @xmath146 where @xmath147 , @xmath148 are integers and @xmath149 are even integers corresponding to the decomposition ( [ ei ] ) and @xmath150 are the energies per spin . therefore , consistently , @xmath151",
    "therefore , if @xmath152 is the minimum energy block in ( [ ei2 ] ) , then the corresponding regular chain will be the ground state .",
    "moreover , it may be that a block composed by the same irreducible block is as well irreducible , e.g. @xmath63 and @xmath153 for second neighbor interactions .",
    "they have the same energy per spin and represent the same ground state .",
    "thus it is enough to consider only the simplest one .",
    "we generalize the preceding procedure for chains with period 2 , with two types of spins @xmath154 and @xmath155 , which in general differ by their interactions and their values .",
    "the chain has in general the form @xmath156 , although , as mentioned in the first section , it could begin as well with a spin of type @xmath157 , differing only by boundary terms .",
    "the generalization of ( [ hg ] ) is @xmath158,\\label{hdia}\\ ] ] where @xmath159 if @xmath103 is odd and @xmath160 if @xmath103 is even . in the following , as in the previous section , for simplicity we will consider bilinear interactions , although the computations remain valid for ( [ hdia ] ) .",
    "thus , for first neighbor interactions , the hamiltonian in the presence of a magnetic field is given by @xmath161 where in general the chain will have periodic boundary conditions , but if it is finite , then @xmath162 for @xmath163 or @xmath16 .",
    "one spin can reduce if it repeats , and it can repeat only after an integer number of periods .",
    "thus reducibility must be defined on blocks of the size @xmath164 .",
    "hence , we take @xmath165 the energy of this chain is @xmath166 where @xmath167 . therefore , similarly as for ( [ energia2 ] ) , this energy can be written as @xmath168 where now @xmath169 . instead of ( [ cadena21 ] ) , we could have @xmath170 , with the same result .",
    "thus , following these lines , a block which reduces a diatomic chain has an even number of spins , @xmath171 , @xmath172 with energy given by ( [ energia2 ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath21 is irreducible if it can not be reduced as ( [ cadena2n1 ] ) . as the property of irreducibility",
    "is given with respect to the formation of regular chains , if @xmath21 is irreducible , so will be any cyclic permutation of its spins .",
    "further , the energy of all these permutations is the same , as the corresponding regular chain does not change ( up to boundary terms ) .    under a parity transformation",
    "a chain transforms as @xmath173 , and its energy @xmath174 is given by @xmath175 , with the couplings interchanged @xmath176 .",
    "thus , the chain is parity symmetric only if it is invariant under @xmath176 , which amounts to @xmath177 , as can be seen from ( [ h21 ] ) . in this case",
    "the spin types must be different , otherwise the chain would be monoatomic . in this case , if @xmath8 is odd and greater than 1 , a chain can contain @xmath100-blocks and it can be seen that an irreducible block will decompose as in ( [ ei ] ) .",
    "next we give some examples , for @xmath178 , for @xmath179 , the irreducible blocks are @xmath180 , @xmath34 and @xmath181 with energies per spin @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 .",
    "note that these energies are symmetric under @xmath176 . for @xmath185 ,",
    "the only block is @xmath186 , whose energies are @xmath187 and @xmath188 . for @xmath189 ,",
    "it is easy to see that there are not irreducible blocks",
    ".    if the spins of both atoms differ , at least the type of the first spin of the block must be specified .",
    "for example if @xmath190 and @xmath191 , where now we give to the spin @xmath192 the values @xmath193 and to @xmath194 the values @xmath195 .",
    "the irreducible blocks will be @xmath196 with energy @xmath197 , @xmath198 with energy @xmath199 , @xmath200 with energy @xmath201 , @xmath202 with energy @xmath203 , @xmath204 with energy @xmath205 , @xmath206 with energy @xmath207 , @xmath208 with energy @xmath209 , @xmath210 with energy @xmath211 and @xmath212 with energy @xmath213 .    for second neighbor interactions ,",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath214 in this case if @xmath215 and @xmath216 then the energy is given by ( [ energia2 ] ) . for @xmath179 , with first spin of @xmath21 of type @xmath217 , @xmath218 $ ] . in general this",
    "energy is not symmetric under @xmath219 , although there are cases like @xmath220 for which it is symmetric . in this last case",
    "the irreducible blocks are @xmath180 , @xmath34 and @xmath181 with spin energies @xmath221 , @xmath222 and @xmath223",
    ". for @xmath185 , @xmath224 , they are irreducible if @xmath225 , or what is the same @xmath226 .",
    "thus the irreducible blocks and their spin energies are @xmath227 , @xmath228 ; @xmath229 , @xmath230 ; @xmath231 , @xmath232 ; @xmath233 , @xmath234 ; @xmath235 , @xmath236 and @xmath237 , @xmath238 . for @xmath239 , @xmath240 , which are irreducible if the pairs @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 are all three different ; further , considering the invariance under cyclic permutations , the pairs @xmath244 , @xmath245 and @xmath246 must be also different .",
    "it turns out that in this case the irreducible blocks are degenerated under the interchange @xmath219 and it is not neccesary to specify the spin type .",
    "thus we get @xmath247 with energy per spin @xmath248 and @xmath249 with energy per spin @xmath250 .",
    "further , for @xmath251 , there are only two blocks , @xmath252 and @xmath253 , which are degenerated , and whose spin energies are @xmath254 if the first spin is of type @xmath217 and @xmath255 if the first spin is of type @xmath157 .",
    "there are not irreducible blocks with a higher number of spins .    for interaction range @xmath8",
    ", the hamiltonian of the chain is @xmath256.\\label{energiadr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us consider a block @xmath257 , for which we take the first spin to be of type @xmath217 for definiteness .",
    "thus , as in the previous section , there are two cases : a ) if @xmath258 and b ) @xmath259 .",
    "in the first case we have @xmath260 where @xmath261 is the smallest integer such that @xmath262 and @xmath263 .",
    "further @xmath264 if @xmath8 is even and @xmath265 if @xmath8 is odd . in the second case , @xmath259 , we take @xmath266 in both cases the energy is given by ( [ energia2 ] ) .",
    "therefore a block @xmath21 is irreducible if the chain with configuration @xmath267 can not be reduced by another block as in ( [ cadena2r1 ] ) or ( [ cadena2r2 ] ) . in order that a block can reduce",
    ", its length must be at least @xmath268 and the notion of displaceable block of morita generalizes and requires that there are two identical blocks of length @xmath8 , but now the distance between them must be @xmath269 .",
    "further , the cyclic permutations of an irreducible block are also irreducible and have the same energy",
    ".    thus , an @xmath8-block beginning with any of both types of spin , will be displaceable if there is an identical @xmath8-block in another position , hence the first spins of both blocks will be at an even distance .",
    "thus , if @xmath270 and @xmath271 are the number of values which can take both types of spins , the maximum number of different possible configurations will be @xmath272 for @xmath8 even and @xmath273 for @xmath8 odd .",
    "thus a block will be always reducible if its length is @xmath274 , because it will have the maximum number of possible configurations plus one . in the parity symmetric case , with @xmath177 , and",
    "different spin types @xmath275 in order that it does not reduce to the monoatomic case , there will be @xmath100-blocks if @xmath8 is odd ( @xmath83 ) , and the analysis of the previous section can be repeated almost without changes .",
    "indeed , the blocks @xmath276 have even length , hence begin and end at the opposite type of spin , and ( [ cadenap ] ) can be implemented .",
    "as an example , for @xmath277 , for equal spins @xmath278 ( different couplings ) , the irreducible blocks are @xmath153 , @xmath31 , @xmath279 , @xmath280 , @xmath247 , @xmath249 , @xmath281 , @xmath253 , @xmath282 , @xmath283 , plus the ones obtained by the interchange @xmath284 , up to parity invariance .",
    "the previous procedure can be straightforwardly generalized for polyatomic chains , with @xmath4 different types of atoms , which different spins and couplings .",
    "such a chain has the form @xmath285 , and there are @xmath4 different couplings at each level of interaction range .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hg ] ) is now @xmath286 where @xmath287 for integer @xmath288 and @xmath289 . as in the preceding sections , for simplicity we consider bilinear interactions . for next nearest neighbor interactions",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath290 thus , a reducible chain has the form @xmath291 where @xmath292 thus the chains @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be merged and the energy of @xmath10 is given by ( [ energia2 ] ) , where @xmath293 where @xmath294 .",
    "thus irreducibility is defined in the same way as before and the cyclic permutations of an irreducible block are irreducible and all of them have the same energy . for @xmath295 , in general there is no parity symmetry because from the right the order of the spins changes and it can not be restored by a cyclic permutation .",
    "it can be seen that there is no symmetry even if parity affects only whole molecules , i.e. if the order inside molecules is not changed .",
    "if all the spins take the same values , then an irreducible block can be specified as @xmath296 , although its energy ( [ energiabp1 ] ) will depend on the type of the spin @xmath297 .",
    "thus in general for this block there will be @xmath4 energies , which can be obtained by the cyclic permutations of the couplings @xmath298 .",
    "for instance for a triatomic chain , with spin @xmath299 for the three atoms , the irreducible blocks with @xmath179 are @xmath300 with energy per spin @xmath301 , @xmath302 with energies @xmath303 , @xmath304 and @xmath305 .",
    "for @xmath185 we get @xmath306 with energies @xmath307 , @xmath308 and @xmath309 and @xmath310 with energies @xmath311 , @xmath312 and @xmath313 , and so on for higher @xmath314 .    for range @xmath8 interactions",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath315 where @xmath316 for @xmath317 is defined as previously .    for the generalization of irreducibility ,",
    "consider again @xmath21 given by ( [ b ] ) .",
    "as in the previous sections , there are two cases : a ) @xmath318 and b ) @xmath319 . in the first case take @xmath320 where @xmath261 is the smallest integer such that @xmath321 , @xmath322 and @xmath323 , where @xmath324 is such that @xmath325 , @xmath326 .",
    "for the second case @xmath327 in both cases the energy is given by ( [ energia2 ] ) , where @xmath24 can be calculated by means of ( [ energiapr ] ) .",
    "therefore a block @xmath21 is irreducible if the regular chain , with configuration @xmath267 , can not be reduced as in ( [ cadenalr1 ] ) or ( [ cadenalr2 ] ) .",
    "moreover the cyclic permutations of @xmath21 are also irreducible and all of them have the same energy .",
    "thus , in order that a block be displaceable , its length must be @xmath8 and there must be another identical @xmath8-block at another place , i.e. the distance of their first spins must be a multiple of the the period @xmath4 .",
    "thus the length of a reducible block must be at least @xmath328 .",
    "further , if the number of values of the spins of the chain are @xmath329 , then the number of different configurations which can take an @xmath8-block will be @xmath330 .",
    "hence the maximum length of an irreducible block will be @xmath331 , where @xmath314 is the maximum integer with @xmath332 .",
    "similar to the diatomic case , if the molecules are parity symmetric there will be @xmath100-blocks , which will be centered on a molecule , but in general ( [ cadenap ] ) will not be possible , unless the blocks @xmath333 have a length multiple of @xmath4 , such that they can be inserted .    for the previous triatomic chain , with @xmath334 ,",
    "the maximum length for irreducible blocks is 9 and , additionally to the irreducible states for @xmath335 , for example the state @xmath336 is irreducible , with energies @xmath337 , @xmath338 and @xmath339 and @xmath340 , with energies @xmath341 and its cyclic permutations .",
    "ground states are obtained from irreducible blocks by direct comparison of their energies in the parameter space . in the absence of magnetic field , there is a symmetry under the interchange up@xmath342down , but in the presence of a magnetic field , the blocks with more than half of the spins pointing down can not be ground states . in certain regions of the parameter space , which can be points or lines , there is degeneracy , i.e. there are ground states with the same energy . in these cases other ground states could be formed as follows @xcite .",
    "if some of these blocks , or cyclic permutations of them , @xmath343 , are such that the first @xmath8 spins of each of them coincide , then they can be merged into an irregular chain in any order @xmath344 and the total energy of the chain will be the sum of the energies of the blocks @xmath345 , where @xmath24 is the energy of the blocks and @xmath346 their frequencies . otherwise ,",
    "if the blocks can not be merged , the regular chains formed by these blocks coexist , i.e. they can transform into each other spontaneously .    in the following",
