    "a detailed knowledge of electron collisions with the oxygen molecule is important for the physics and chemistry of both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas . in particular , recent attempts to understand the electrical discharge oxygen - iodine laser have suggested that excited electronic states of o@xmath0 molecule play an important role @xcite . in a previous paper @xcite ( henceforth denoted i ) , we studied integral cross sections for electron collisions with the o@xmath0 molecule in its excited @xmath7 and @xmath8 states , in addition to the much studied electron scattering by the o@xmath0 @xmath9 ground state .",
    "we used the fixed - bond r - matrix method with 13 target states represented by valence configuration interaction wave functions .",
    "state - averaged complete active space scf ( sa - casscf ) orbitals with gaussian type basis functions were employed .",
    "the calculated cross sections for electron impact excitation from the @xmath2 state to the @xmath10 state at 4.5 ev agree well with the available experimental data of hall and trajmar @xcite .",
    "although elastic scattering of electrons by the @xmath2 and @xmath10 states was also studied , we could not find any experimental data for comparison .    in i ,",
    "theoretical and experimental integral cross sections were compared . however , differential cross sections ( dcss ) provide a more stringent test of theory and are often easier to measure reliably than integral cross sections . for electron impact electronic excitations ,",
    "calculations which give good integral cross sections often give dcs s which differ significantly from those observed experimentally . in this paper , we present dcss for the corresponding processes calculated using the same r - matrix model .",
    "previous experimental and theoretical studies in the field of electron o@xmath0 collisions are well summarized by brunger and buckman @xcite .",
    "here we only review works relevant to this paper .",
    "the dcss of electron collisions with o@xmath0 molecule have been measured by many experimental groups .",
    "in particular , electron impact excitations to the low - lying @xmath2 and @xmath10 states have been studied experimentally by trajmar et al .",
    "@xcite , shyn and sweeney @xcite , allan @xcite , middleton et al .",
    "@xcite , and linert et al .",
    "in contrast to these experimental works , only middleton et al .",
    "@xcite report calculations of dcss for these excitation processes .",
    "some of the more recent measurements have focused on electron impact excitations from the @xmath9 ground state to the ` 6 ev states ' , i.e. , the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 states which are also called the herzberg pseudocontinuum @xcite . although these dcss are not state - resolved in most case , shyn and sweeney @xcite obtained cross sections for excitation to the individual electronic state within the ` 6 ev states ' . in this paper",
    ", we also calculate the dcss of this process using the fixed - bond r - matrix method , since no previous theoretical calculation exists . up to now , there is only one measurement of dcss for electron collisions with electronically excited o@xmath0 molecule . hall and trajmar @xcite obtained excitation cross sections from the o@xmath0 @xmath2 to the @xmath10 state at electron impact energy of 4.5 ev .",
    "their integral cross section was compared with our r - matrix results in i.    in this paper , details of the calculations are presented in section 2 , and we discuss the results in section 3 comparing our results with previous theoretical and available experiments .",
    "then the summary is given in section 4 .",
    "the r - matrix method itself has been described extensively in the literature @xcite as well as in i. thus we do not repeat a general explanation of the method here .",
    "we used a modified version of the polyatomic programs in the uk molecular r - matrix codes @xcite to extract t - matrix elements of the electron o@xmath0 scatterings .",
    "these programs utilize gaussian type orbitals ( gto ) to represent target molecule as well as a scattering electron .",
    "although most of the past r - matrix works on electron o@xmath0 collisions have employed slater type orbitals ( sto ) , we select gtos mainly because of the simplicity of the input and availability of basis functions .",
    "the sa - casscf orbitals are imported from the calculations with molpro suites of programs @xcite .",
    "the use of sa - casscf orbitals improves the vertical excitation energies of the o@xmath0 target states compared to the energies from hf orbitals as shown in i. these target orbitals are constructed from the the [ 5s,3p ] contracted basis of dunning@xcite augmented by a d function with exponent 1.8846 , as in sarpal et al . @xcite . in the r - matrix calculations",
    ", we included 13 target states ; @xmath11,@xmath12 , @xmath13,@xmath14,@xmath15 , @xmath16,@xmath17,@xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20,@xmath21,@xmath22 and @xmath23 , where the last 4 @xmath24 states were not included in the previous r - matrix studies performed by other groups .",
    "these target states were represented by valence configuration interaction wave functions constructed from the sa - casscf orbitals . in our fixed - bond r - matrix calculations , these target states are evaluated at the equilibrium bond length @xmath25 = 2.3 a@xmath26 of the o@xmath0 @xmath11 ground electronic state .",
    "the radius of the r - matrix sphere was chosen to be 10 a@xmath26 in our calculations . in order to represent the scattering electron , we included diffuse gaussian functions up to @xmath27 = 5 with 9 functions for @xmath27 = 0 , 7 functions for @xmath27 = 1 - 3 and 6 functions for @xmath27 = 4 and 5 .",
    "the exponents of these diffuse gaussian were fitted using the gtobas program @xcite in the uk r - matrix codes .",
    "details of the fitting procedure are the same as in faure et al .",
    "in addition to these continuum orbitals , we included 8 extra virtual orbitals , one for each symmetry .",
    "the construction of the 17 electrons csfs for the total system is the same as in i. the r - matrix calculations were performed for all 8 irreducible representations of the d@xmath28 symmetry , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , for both doublet and quartet spin multiplicity of the electron plus target system .",
    "the dcss are evaluated from the t - matrix elements obtained by the r - matrix calculations . as in gianturco and jain @xcite and malegat @xcite ,",
    "the dcs is expanded using the legendre polynomials , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the initial and final electronic states of the target , respectively . in exactly the same way as in malegat @xcite , but for @xmath40 symmetry instead of @xmath41 symmetry in her paper , we can derive an expression of the the expansion coefficients @xmath42 , which is @xmath43 details of the derivation are given in the appendix . in equation [ m2eq ] , @xmath44 etc .",
    "are 3@xmath39 coefficients , @xmath45 is the wave number of the incident electron , @xmath46 is the spin quantum number of the initial target state , while @xmath47 is the spin quantum number of the total system and @xmath48 is the projection of the total spin . the indices @xmath49 and @xmath50 run over the 8 irreducible representations of the @xmath40 point group , since we employ the polyatomic version of the uk r - matrix code .",
    "the angular quantum numbers of the scattering electron , @xmath51 and @xmath52 etc . in the t - matrix element @xmath53",
    "specify the real spherical harmonics @xmath54 instead of complex form @xmath55 , because the @xmath54 transform as irreducible representations under @xmath40 symmetry .",
    "this means , there are transformation matrix elements @xmath56 etc . in the expression for @xmath57 in order to convert the index of the scattering electron from the @xmath54 representation to the @xmath55 representation .",
    "an expression of the matrix elements @xmath58 is given in the appendix .",
    "finally , we note that the summations over ( @xmath49,@xmath51,@xmath52 ) should satisfy the symmetry relation , @xmath59 , with ir@xmath60 and ir@xmath61 each being an irreducible representation of the @xmath40 group corresponding to the @xmath38th target state and the real spherical harmonic @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "this relation also holds for ( @xmath49,@xmath63,@xmath64 ) , ( @xmath50,@xmath65,@xmath66 ) and ( @xmath50,@xmath67,@xmath68 ) .",
    "in equation [ m2eq ] , the t - matrix elements belonging to different total symmetries are multiplied together .",
    "since these matrix elements come from different calculations , overall phases of molecular orbitals and target ci vectors underlying these matrix elements may be inconsistent ( see @xcite ) , which may result in erroneous relative signs of these t - matrix elements . to avoid this inconsistency , we saved reference target ci vectors from the first calculation , @xmath29 symmetry for example , and then aligned the overall phases of the target ci vectors in other calculations , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 symmetries , according to this reference .",
    "the same set of molecular orbitals was used in all these calculations .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows dcss for elastic electron scattering from the o@xmath0 @xmath11 state compared with previous theoretical and experimental results .",
    "our results are very similar to the previous r - matrix cross sections of wste et al . @xcite .",
    "the cross sections of machado et al .",
    "@xcite were calculated using the schwinger variational iterative method combined with the distorted - wave approximation .",
    "their results at 5 ev are much lower than the r - matrix results at low scattering angle below 50 degrees .",
    "our results agree reasonably well with the experimental cross sections at 10 ev , including the recent results of linert et al .",
    "@xcite for backward scattering . at 5 ev",
    ", our model significantly overestimates the cross sections for forward scattering compared to the experimental values .",
    "for example , our result is twice as large as the experimental values at 10@xmath69 .",
    "this situation is the same in the previous r - matrix calculation of wste et al . @xcite . as discussed by wste et al .",
    ", this deviation can be attributed to a lack of long - range polarizability in the scattering model .",
    "for example , gillan et al .",
    "@xcite introduced polarized pseudostates to account for the long - range polarizability in electron - n@xmath0 scattering and reduced the cross sections by 50%  in the threshold energy region .",
    "the interaction potential of machado et al .",
    "@xcite includes the correlation - polarization term based on free - electron - gas model .",
    "probably the polarization introduced by this term is responsible for their better agreement with experiment at 5 ev .",
    "since we are interested in electron collisions with the excited electronic states of o@xmath0 in this work , we chose not to pursue precise accuracy further for the ground state elastic scattering .",
    "however , we have to be mindful that similar long - range polarizability problems may exist in the other low - energy electron scattering processes , especially elastic electron scattering of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 state o@xmath0 molecules , which will be discussed below .    the dcss for excitation to the @xmath12 state at electron impact energy 5 and 10 ev are compared in figure [ fig2 ] with the previous theoretical calculation and the experimental measurements of middleton et al .",
    "@xcite , shyn and sweeney @xcite , allan @xcite and linert et al . @xcite .",
    "the cross sections at 5 ev agrees well with the previous calculation and experimental data below 120@xmath69 .",
    "however , our results are much lower than the previous calculation of middleton et al . at scattering angle above 130@xmath69 . at an electron scattering energy of 10 ev ,",
    "our cross section deviates further from the previous calculation of middleton et al .",
    "@xcite especially at scattering angle below 60@xmath69 and above 140@xmath69 .",
    "in contrast to the backward enhanced cross sections of middleton et al . , our dcss have a slightly forward enhanced character .",
    "our results agree better with the experimental data at low scattering angles than the previous calculation of middleton et al .",
    "@xcite . at large scattering angle ,",
    "our results deviate from the experimental data of shyn and sweeney @xcite , but agrees rather well with the recent measurement of linert et al . @xcite . the r - matrix model of middleton et al .",
    "@xcite included the lowest 9 o@xmath0 target states and @xmath27 = 0 - 5 scattering electron orbitals with @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 symmetry .",
    "in this work , we included 13 target states and all components of @xmath27 = 0 - 5 scattering electron orbitals .",
    "in addition to these differences , middleton et al . used hf / sto orbitals where we employed casscf / gto orbitals .",
    "we carried out a test calculation with @xmath27 = 0 - 3 scattering electron orbitals and got almost the same cross sections as in @xmath27 = 0 - 5 case , which suggests that difference in the number of target states may be important for the shape of these excitation cross sections .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] compares dcss for excitation to the @xmath13 state at electron impact energy of 5 and 10 ev with the previous r - matrix calculation and the experimental measurements of middleton et al .",
    "@xcite , shyn and sweeney @xcite and allan @xcite .",
    "transitions between @xmath73 and @xmath74 target states are forbidden at scattering angles of 0@xmath69 and 180@xmath69 , because the scattered electron wave function vanishes in the plane defined by incident electron beam and the molecular axis for any orientation of the molecule @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the dcss decrease to be zero toward 0 and 180@xmath69 . as is apparent from figure [ fig3 ] , our cross sections become zero at 0 and 180@xmath69 , which is consistent with this selection rule .",
    "compared to the previous r - matrix calculations of middleton et al .",
    "@xcite , our cross sections have similar profile , but with slightly smaller magnitude at all scattering angles .",
    "agreement with experiment is good at 5 ev below 120@xmath69 , although our results underestimate the experimental cross sections at larger scattering angles . at 10 ev , the magnitude of the experimental cross sections of middleton et al .",
    "@xcite and shyn and sweeney @xcite do not agree with each other , however our cross sections are closer to the results of shyn and sweeney at low scattering angles below 50@xmath69 .",
    "between 60@xmath69 and 90@xmath69 , our results are closer to the results of middleton et al .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows dcss for excitations to the 6 ev states for electron impact energies of 10 and 15 ev . here",
    "the 6 ev states means the group of the o@xmath0 @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 states .",
    "the cross sections shown in figure [ fig4 ] are a sum of individual excitation cross sections of these 3 electronic states , in line with most experimental measurements .",

    "@xcite and shyn and sweeney @xcite .",
    "the individual cross sections are shown in figure [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] for impact energies of 10 and 15 ev , together with the state - resolved experimental cross sections of shyn and sweeney @xcite .",
    "our summed cross sections given in figure [ fig4 ] are backward - enhanced for both the 10 and 15 ev cases , in accordance with the experimental cross sections campbell et al .",
    "@xcite and shyn and sweeney @xcite . however , the forward enhancement of the dcss at 10 ev observed by green et al .",
    "@xcite is not reproduced by our calculation .",
    "the individual cross sections in figure [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] show similar angular behaviour compared to the experimental results of shyn and sweeney .",
    "however our dcss for excitation to the @xmath15 state is more steep toward backward direction .",
    "also the peak in the @xmath16 state cross sections is more pronounced in our calculation .",
    "note that our results for the @xmath16 state become zero at 0 and 180@xmath69 as dictated by the @xmath75 selection rule .",
    "the dcss for elastic electron scattering with the excited o@xmath0 @xmath12 and @xmath13 states are shown in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "we can not compare them with previous theoretical or experimental work , since there is no available data .",
    "these dcss show strong similarity with those of the elastic electron scattering with the @xmath11 ground state in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the magnitude of these cross sections is almost the same for the 10 ev case .",
    "all of them have a large forward peak at 0@xmath69 , a small rise in the cross sections at 180@xmath69 . the location of the minimum moves inward from 140@xmath69 to 90@xmath69 as the electron scattering energy increases .",
    "this similarity is also reflected in the integral cross sections for elastic electron collisions with the @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 states .",
    "the profiles and magnitudes of the integral cross sections are basically the same for all these 3 electronic states as shown in i. the main configuration of these 3 electronic states has the form @xmath76 , and this may be responsible for this similarity .",
    "our r - matrix calculations tend to overestimate the elastic scattering cross sections of the @xmath11 state at low scattering angles , below 50@xmath69 , compared to the experimental data . considering the strong similarity of the cross section profiles for elastic scattering from excited states and the ground state",
    ", our calculations may also overestimate the cross section at low scattering angle at low electron impact energy .    in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we show momentum transfer cross sections for electron elastic scattering by the @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 states . as a consequence of the similarity in dcss , the momentum transfer cross sections have a similar magnitude .",
    "compared to the experimental data of shyn and sharp @xcite and sullivan et al .",
    "@xcite , our calculation overestimates the @xmath11 state momentum transfer cross section at 2 ev by 20 % , but underestimates the cross section at 10 ev by 8 % of sullivan et al.s value or 29 % of shyn and sharp s value .",
    "our momentum transfer cross sections for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 states may similarly be overestimates or underestimates depending on the electron impact energy .",

    "the figure also includes the experimental data of hall and trajmar @xcite at impact energy of 4.5 ev .",
    "our cross section profiles have characteristic features of minima around 10@xmath69 and 90@xmath69 and maxima around 50@xmath69 and 150@xmath69 .",
    "they agree with the experimental cross sections of hall and trajmar @xcite within their error bars except at 20@xmath69 and 30@xmath69 .",
    "the cross sections of hall and trajmar appear to increase from 50@xmath69 to 0@xmath69 whereas our cross sections decrease from 60@xmath69 toward 10@xmath69 . in the 50@xmath69",
    " 140@xmath69 angular region , hall and trajmar s cross sections vary less than ours .",
    "however , a precise comparison is difficult because of large error bars and lack of other experimental data .",
    "we have calculated differential cross sections for electron collisions with o@xmath0 molecule in its ground @xmath1 state , as well as excited @xmath2 and @xmath3 states . as in our previous work , we employed the fixed - bond r - matrix method based on state - averaged complete active space scf orbitals . in additions to elastic scattering of electron with the o@xmath0 @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 states , we studied electron impact excitations from the @xmath1 state to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states as well as 6 ev states of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 states .",
