    "<S> a novel approach that enables the study of parallel transport in magnetized plasmas is presented . </S>",

    "<S> temperature flattening in magnetic islands is accurately computed . for a wave number @xmath0 , the fattening time scales as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the parallel diffusivity , and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) for non - local ( local ) transport . </S>",
    "<S> the fractal structure of the devil staircase temperature radial profile in weakly chaotic fields is resolved . in fully chaotic fields , </S>",
    "<S> the temperature exhibits self - similar evolution of the form @xmath5 $ ] , where @xmath6 is a radial coordinate . in the local case </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath7 is gaussian and the scaling is sub - diffusive , @xmath8 . in the non - local case , @xmath7 decays algebraically , @xmath9 , and the scaling is diffusive , @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of transport in magnetized plasmas is a problem of fundamental interest in controlled fusion , space plasmas , and astrophysics research . </S>",
    "<S> three issues make this problem particularly challenging : ( i ) the _ extreme anisotropy _ between the parallel ( i.e. , along the magnetic field ) , @xmath11 , and the perpendicular , @xmath12 , conductivities ( @xmath13 may exceed @xmath14 in fusion plasmas ) ; ( ii ) magnetic _ field lines chaos _ which in general complicates ( and may preclude ) the construction of magnetic field line coordinates ; and ( iii ) _ nonlocal parallel transport _ in the limit of small collisionality . as a result of these challenges , </S>",
    "<S> standard finite difference and finite elements numerical methods suffer from a number of ailments . </S>",
    "<S> chief among them are the pollution of perpendicular dynamics due to truncation errors in the discrete representation of the parallel heat flux , and the lack of a discrete maximum principle ( to enforce temperature positivity ) .    despite the severity of these issues </S>",
    "<S> , recent studies have succeeded in partially addressing some of them , and important progress has been made in the study of parallel transport . </S>",
    "<S> reference  @xcite discussed a finite element numerical implementation of nonlocal heat transport with applications including temperature flattening across magnetic islands and tokamak disruptions . </S>",
    "<S> the use of high - order discretizations has been shown to mitigate numerical pollution of the perpendicular dynamics in finite - difference @xcite and finite - element methods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a maximum principle has been shown to be enforceable by the use of limiters at the discrete level in finite differences @xcite , and finite elements @xcite , albeit with the effect of rendering both spatial discretizations formally first - order accurate . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a second order finite - difference iterative krylov method was used to find the steady state solution of the heat transport equation in a weakly chaotic magnetic field .    motivated by the strong anisotropy typically encountered in magnetized plasmas ( @xmath15 ) , we study parallel heat transport in the extreme anisotropic regime ( @xmath16 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the previously mentioned numerical difficulties , this regime presents potentially insurmountable issues regarding the algorithmic inversion of the discretized transport equation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the potentially degenerate null space of the parallel transport operator might render the use of state - of - the - art scalable iterative inversion methods ( e.g. multigrid methods ) impractical . to overcome these numerical challenges , we present a novel lagrangian green s function approach . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed method bypasses the need to discretize and invert the transport operators on a grid and allows the integration of the parallel transport equation without perpendicular pollution , while preserving the positivity of the temperature field . </S>",
    "<S> the method is applicable to local and non - local transport in integrable , weakly chaotic , and fully chaotic magnetic fields .    beyond the integration method , </S>",
    "<S> this letter presents novel physics results . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between local and non - local parallel temperature mixing and flattening inside magnetic islands is studied . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest is the dependence of the temperature relaxation time on the wave number of the temperature perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> understanding this problem is of significant interest to assess the impact of magnetic islands on magnetic confinement . </S>",
    "<S> parallel transport is also studied in the case of weakly chaotic and fully chaotic @xmath17-d magnetic fields . in the case of weakly chaotic fields , </S>",
    "<S> the fractal hamiltonian structure of the magnetic islands implies that , as the ratio @xmath18 increases , the radial temperature profile approaches a devil - staircase . </S>",
    "<S> going beyond previous studies @xcite , we unveil the fractal structure of the devil - staircase in the previously unaccessible @xmath19 regime . </S>",
    "<S> these results open the possibility of a deeper understanding of the role of cantori which have been observed to act as partial transport barriers in numerical studies @xcite and experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another problem of considerable interest in fusion and astrophysical plasmas is the understanding of electron heat transport in fully chaotic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the case of local parallel transport has been extensively studied since the pioneering work in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , most studies have restricted their attention to local transport . here , in addition of the study of the local transport , we present novel results on the self - similar , non - gaussian spatio - temporal scaling of radial heat transport in the non - local case .    </S>",
    "<S> our starting point is the heat transport equation in a constant density plasma [ eq_1 ] _ t t = - , where @xmath20 is the heat flux . for local transport , in the limit @xmath21 , [ eq_2 ] * q*= - _ , where @xmath22 . </S>",

    "<S> the zooms in the successive panels unveil the fractal structure of the devil - staircase profile . ]    at this point it is important to indicate a fundamental difference between the work in refs  @xcite and the method proposed here . in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the flux is calculated throughout the computational domain by integrating along the field lines . however , in these references , once the flux is computed , the lagrangian approach is abandoned and the flux is mapped to gaussian quadrature points for the finite - element standard integration of the temperature evolution equation on a grid . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the method proposed here is fully lagrangian and completely bypasses the use of finite differences or finite elements integration schemes , circumventing the numerical limitations discussed before . </S>",
    "<S> another clear advantage of the use of the green s function is that the solution at an arbitrary time @xmath49 is obtained directly from the integral in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> what follows , we use the lagrangian green s function method to study local and non - local parallel transport in magnetic fields of increasing levels of complexity . </S>",

    "<S> of particular interest is the difference in the temperature relaxation properties in the presence of local and nonlocal transport . </S>",
    "<S> figure  1 shows the solution of the parallel transport of an initial condition of the form @xmath57 with @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , for large enough times , the temperature relaxes to a unique solution of the form @xmath31 in both the local and non - local cases . </S>",

    "<S> as the figure shows , temperature mixing in the non - local case is less homogeneous and slower than in the local case . in general , from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ greens ] ) it follows that the homogenization time of a temperature perturbation with mode number @xmath0 scales as @xmath59 with @xmath4 ( @xmath3 ) in the case of local ( non - local ) transport .    for the study of transport in @xmath17-d magnetic fields , </S>",
