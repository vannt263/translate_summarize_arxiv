    "current cosmological observations indicate that about 96@xmath1 of the total energy content of our universe is made of yet unknown dark components and only 4@xmath1 is made of particles of the standard model . among them , there are precision measurements of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite , and type ia supernovae @xcite . for a recent review of the nowadays status of cosmology see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "usually this _ dark fluid _ is separated into two components : a clustering _ dark matter _ piece responsible for forming structure in the universe and a nonclustering _ dark energy _ with a negative pressure that is responsible for the current accelerated cosmic expansion .",
    "moreover , in the concordance model of cosmology the so - called lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) model the dark energy is of geometric nature and enters as a constant at the lagrangian level of einstein s gravitational theory . for gravity matters ,",
    "the cosmological constant is indistinguishable from the vacuum contribution of quantum fields , and here appears an intriguing problem , the sum of both contributions is about 1 over @xmath2 times the latter @xcite .",
    "a second conceptual problem with the @xmath0cdm model comes out when one considers the ratio of dark energy over dark matter energy densities , which in spite of growing with the third power of the scale factor of the universe , its value today is of order one .",
    "this is the so - called _ coincidence problem_. as a consequence , a plethora of alternative proposals has appeared in the literature ; as a short sample see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we argue that the separation of the dark fluid into dark matter and dark energy is arbitrary and is only favored for historical reasons and computational simplicity .",
    "after all , we define the dark fluid as our lack of knowledge as and @xmath3 , otherwise is stated . ]",
    "@xmath4 where @xmath5 comes from the observed geometry of the universe and @xmath6 from its observed energy content .",
    "in fact , the dark sector could be composed by a large zoo of particles with complicated interactions between them . or",
    ", it could be even just one exotic unknown dark fluid .",
    "this property has been called _ dark degeneracy _ by m. kunz @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "in this paper we assume an astrophysical perspective to the dark fluid by defining it as a barotropic fluid with speed of sound equal to zero , as in @xcite and more recently in @xcite ; for similar approaches see @xcite .    making the speed of sound equal to zero ensures that dark fluid energy density perturbations will grow at all scales , but",
    "at the same time , it allows the fluid to have a nonzero pressure .",
    "this is quite in contrast with canonical scalar fields as quintessence , for which the speed of its perturbations is equal to one , a feature that makes dark energy perturbations to be quickly damped , so they do not grow inside the horizon .",
    "interactions within the dark sector has been studied largely in the literature @xcite , mainly as a mechanism to solve the coincidence problem . on the other hand ,",
    "interactions between dark matter and the standard model of particles are expected , and have been studied also on several occasions .",
    "in fact , the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) paradigm has emerged as the predominant scenario to solve the missing mass problem @xcite . nevertheless , other alternatives have been proposed . among them , special attention has been attracted by the strong interacting dark matter scenarios @xcite , in which dark matter interacts with itself and with baryons @xcite through the strong force .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this alternative can alleviate the cuspy halos and overdensity of substructure problems that appear in n - body simulations based on the standard @xmath0cdm model @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we develop a general class of couplings of the dark fluid to the standard model of particles , and show that they can be also understood as interactions of dark matter to baryons .",
    "then , we impose constraints by using cmb anisotropies and supernovae observations .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we define the dark fluid from the properties of the dark matter itself . in sec .",
    "iii we work out the cosmological background solutions for the dark fluid and show that they are identical to the @xmath0cdm model ones , leading to the dark degeneracy . in sec .",
    "iv we show that the dark degeneracy is preserved under some assumptions when one goes beyond zero order in cosmological perturbation theory . in sec .",
    "v we work a multifluid description of the dark sector , allowing interaction among its components . in sec .",
    "vi we extend these interactions to baryons to try to break the dark degeneracy . finally , in sec .",
    "vii , we present our conclusions .",
    "considering newtonian gravity for the moment , the overdensities of matter in an expanding universe follow the equation in fourier space    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is a physical wavelength ( contrary to the comoving wavelength which we will use in the following sections ) related to a physical length scale by @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the speed of sound of the fluid under consideration and prime means derivative with respect to cosmic time . in astrophysical",
    "scales it is safe to set @xmath11 and then , the scale factor is equal to a constant that we make equal to one for this discussion matters .",
    "it follows that there is a threshold scale , the jeans length , given by @xmath12 for which perturbations with physical length above it , @xmath13 , grow by gravitational collapse , and perturbations with @xmath14 develop acoustic oscillations .",
    "we expect to have dark matter structure at a wide range of scales : from the largest cosmological structure to galaxies .",
    "in fact even dwarf galaxies need to have dark matter halos in order to stabilize their disks and to account for the necessary gravity sources to obtain the observed flat rotation curves which follow the luminous matter in there . the only way to guarantee that dark matter perturbations grow at all scales is demanding that the jeans length be equal to zero .    for barotropic fluids the adiabatic speed of sound coincides with the speed at which perturbations propagate in the fluid .",
    "we define the dark fluid as a barotropic fluid with an adiabatic speed of sound equal to zero ,    @xmath15    and that , at a first approximation , does not interact with particles of the standard model . without lost of generality",
    "we can write its equation of state as    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is its equation of state parameter and is a function of the energy density @xmath18 only .",
    "thus we have @xmath19 . using eq .",
    "( [ dfdef ] ) we obtain that the equation of state parameter is solved by the equation @xmath20 , whose solution is @xmath21 with @xmath22 a constant and the minus sign is set for later convenience .",
    "this means that the pressure is a constant @xmath23 astrophysical observations constrain this value to be very small , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the energy density of typical astrophysical scales where dark matter has been detected .",
    "usually , it is assumed that dark matter is pressureless , but this is by not means necessary , for instance it could be the case that @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a typical cosmological energy density scale at present , without getting in contradiction with observations .",
    "in fact , this is the entrance that leads us to consider the dark fluid to be dark energy as well as dark matter .",
    "now , let us consider a friedmann - robertson - walker description of the universe at very large scales , filled with standard model particles ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , ... ) and with the above - defined dark fluid , from now on labeled by @xmath30 .",
    "the evolution equations of such a universe are    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    and @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the hubble factor",
    ". equations ( [ s2 ] ) and ( [ s3 ] ) give @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where a subindex @xmath38 means that the quantity under consideration is evaluated at present time , and we have normalized the scale factor to be equal to one today , @xmath39 .",
    "integration of eq .",
    "( [ s4 ] ) gives , using eq .",
    "( [ eosdf ] ) ,    @xmath40    where we have defined the constant @xmath41 .",
    "this expression is what we expect for the evolution of a unified fluid : a piece that redshifts with the scale factor as @xmath42 , as a dark matter component does , and a piece that remains constant , as vacuum energy .",
    "this result has been found elsewhere in the literature , as in @xcite , which investigated the @xmath0cdm limit of a chapliying gas , or as in the study of barotropic fluids with constant speed of sound @xcite .",
    "in fact , using the language of e. linder and r. scherrer @xcite , in our case the term proportional to @xmath42 is the _ aether _ piece of a barotropic fluid .",
    "now , the equation of state parameter of the dark fluid ( [ eosdf ] ) becomes @xmath43 we want to stress that the energy density of the dark fluid is proportional to the inverse of its equation of state parameter    @xmath44    and that its pressure , expressed in terms of the constant @xmath45 instead of @xmath22 , is @xmath46 in order to ensure the positivity of the energy density at all times , @xmath45 must be a positive number .",
    "this implies that the pressure is negative , a quality that allows the dark fluid to accelerate the universe , and as we have outlined in the last section it could take values of the order of the critical density @xmath47 without affecting the behavior of the dark fluid as dark matter in astrophysical scenarios .",
    "the friedmann equation ( [ s1 ] ) becomes    @xmath48    this is the same evolution equation for the scale factor as in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this is not an accident , if one assumes @xmath0cdm as the valid model and considers the total energy density of the dark components , @xmath49 , the total equation of state parameter , @xmath50 , defined by @xmath51 where the subindex @xmath52 runs over dark matter ( dm ) and cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) , is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "( [ eosdf2 ] ) and ( [ s1_2 ] ) , we note that under the identifications @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 , the resulting evolution cosmology in both models are exactly the same , at least at the background level .",
    "this property has been called _ dark degeneracy _ by m. kunz in @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is more general than for the single fluid case worked here : any collection of fluids whose total equation of state parameter is equal to eq .",
    "( [ eost2 ] ) and that do not interact with baryons and photons will behave exactly as the composed dark matter - cosmological constant fluid , leading to a degeneracy with the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "in this section we explicitly show that the degeneracy is preserved when one goes beyond the homogeneous and isotropic cosmology , but only under some general assumptions that have been taken for granted in previous works .",
    "we divide the discussion into linear and higher orders in cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "let us consider cosmological perturbation theory in the conformal newtonian gauge , the metric is given by ( for details see @xcite ) @xmath60,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the conformal time related to the cosmic time by @xmath62 .",
    "as usual , we define the matter perturbation variables through the expressions of the energy momentum tensor    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the anisotropic ( traceless ) stress tensor .",
    "the energy density @xmath18 and the pressure @xmath65 denotes background quantities and are functions of the conformal time only .",
    "the vector @xmath66 is called the peculiar velocity and is related to the four velocity @xmath67 of the fluid by the relation @xmath68 . in fourier space",
    "we define the velocity @xmath69 and the scalar anisotropic stress @xmath70 .",
    "we use the flat space metric @xmath71 to raise and lower indices of intrinsic space geometrical objects like @xmath66 and @xmath64 .",
    "the hydrodynamical equations for a general fluid are @xcite    @xmath72    where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and a dot means derivative with respect to conformal time . for the dark fluid case ,",
    "@xmath76 and these equations become    @xmath77    while for baryons after recombination ( when the coupling to photons can be safety neglected ) @xmath78 the fluid equations are supplemented with the einstein s equations    @xmath79    and @xmath80 where the sum runs over all fluid contributions and @xmath81 is the rest fluid energy density @xcite .    to solve these equations , we need to add information about the nature of the dark fluid .",
    "the barotropic condition implies that @xmath82 and thus @xmath83 , and because it is a perfect fluid , the anisotropic stress vanishes , @xmath84 .",
    "accordingly , the space - space components of the perturbed energy momentum tensor are equal to zero , @xmath85 .",

( [ ass2 ] ) implies that @xmath106 , which explains the behavior of the curves in fig .",

    "it is interesting to note the behavior of the density contrast of the dark fluid ( fig .",
    "1c ) , which initially grows as a dark matter component to later decay asymptotically to zero .",
    "in fact , this behavior is natural for all wavelengths modes as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ pertddf ] ) and ( [ perttdf ] ) : at late times , when @xmath108 tends to -1 , the @xmath109 source becomes independent of @xmath93 and is a negative quantity which tends to zero .",
    "meanwhile at early times , for @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and the equations become equal to the cold dark matter evolution equations , ( [ pertddm ] ) and ( [ perttdm ] ) .      to go beyond the linear order , let us make perturbation expansions to the dark fluid and @xmath0cdm energy momentum tensors about the ( zero order ) background cosmological fluids as @xmath112 if the total energy momentum tensors of both models are equal @xmath113 , clearly each of the terms in the expansion will be equal as well @xmath114 .",
    "this argument is outlined in @xcite to argue that the degeneracy is preserved at all orders .",
    "certainly , this is correct .",
    "nonetheless , we want to stress a different approach : we are affected gravitationally by the total energy momentum tensor , but usually when comparing observations to models we expand it as in eq .",
    "( [ emtexp ] ) , and after this we assign values to each of the pieces .",
    "the fact that both energy momentum tensors are equal , say at zero order , does not imply that they will be equal at first order .",
    "in this situation , equations such as ( [ ass1 ] ) and ( [ ass2 ] ) are conditions of the theory and not consequences of it , and if not imposed , the degeneracy is broken , as seen in fig.1 for @xmath115 .",
    "this approach , which we will adopt , is very close to that followed in some papers which investigate modified gravity theories that are indistinguishable in the background from the @xmath0cdm model but could differ in linear order , leaving imprints that are parametrized to compare to current and future observations ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , if some of these imprints were detected , they could be a consequence of interactions within the dark sector ( or even with baryons , as those we study in sec .",
    "vi ) , instead of a deviation of general relativity .",
    "finally , there is a subtle point that is pertinent to assert at this moment .",
    "the fact that the universe is so smooth at very large scales is what allows us to expand the energy momentum tensor of the cosmic fluids as in eq .",
    "( [ emtexp ] ) .",
    "the zero - order term is in fact a spatial average in hypersurfaces of constant cosmic time , @xmath116 , and thereafter we assume that general relativity holds in the form @xmath117 .",
    "this is not true in general due to the nonlinear character of gravity ; it is well known that backreaction effects contributes to this last equation . for recent work in the averaging procedure in cosmology and its caveats",
    "see @xcite .    for the specific case that concerns us",
    "there is a related issue .",
    "let us consider a fluid with equation of state @xmath118 that leads to a unified description of the dark sector .",
    "it has been noted that it is not necessarily true that @xmath119 @xcite ; in fact higher - order corrections enter into this equation .",
    "therefore , when some scale grows and leaves the linear regime , the naive averaging procedure on the equation of state is no longer valid .",
    "this nonlinear effect has been investigated in @xcite , and it was shown that instabilities are expected to occur in unified dark models , even on large cosmological scales .",
    "two exceptions are the cases in which the involved equations of state are @xmath120 and @xmath121 , with @xmath17 a constant .",
    "the former is the case of the dark fluid , and then , it does not suffer for this _ averaging problem_. nonetheless , it is worth emphasizing that in models that depart although indistinguishable by current observations when calculations are performed using the average procedure from the dark fluid or from the @xmath0cdm models these effects must be considered .",
    "from the last section it is clear that the dark fluid , although not necessarily , could be the sum of a dark matter and a cosmological constant components . nonetheless , if the interaction to the particles of the standard model is only gravitational ( which is the ultimate definition of _ dark _ ) , the nature of the dark fluid is fundamentally impossible to elucidate , because of the universality of this force .    in this section",
    "we explore the possibility that the dark fluid is composed of a collection of dark components with possible interactions between them .",
    "the equations that we obtain will be generalized in the next section to include interactions to baryons .",
    "let us consider the einstein field equations ,    @xmath122    where the subindex @xmath52 labels the different dark components .",
    "if we forbid dark components to interact with standard model particles , the bianchi identities imply @xmath123 and    @xmath124    where the energy momentum transfer vectors , @xmath125 , obey the constraint @xmath126 considering for the moment the homogeneous and isotropic cosmology , the continuity equation for each fluid is    @xmath127    where @xmath128 denote the energy transfer between different dark components .",
    "this implies that at zero order , ( ignoring the subindex @xmath52 s for the moment )    @xmath129    if we define @xmath130 , then @xmath131 and @xmath132 now , following @xcite , we split the interaction vector as @xmath133 where the momentum transfer , @xmath134 , is first order and is orthogonal to the four velocity @xmath135 .",
    "thus , under spatial rotations @xmath136 transforms as a scalar and @xmath137 as a vector .",
    "accordingly , we decompose @xmath138 as @xmath139 with @xmath140 a scalar and @xmath141 a transverse vector , @xmath142 , and we define the perturbation @xmath143 through @xmath144 where in the last equality we defined @xmath145 . from ( [ descomq ] )",
    "it follows that up to first order    @xmath146    finally , from eq .",

    "also we have used the decomposition for @xmath154 in tensor , vector and scalar pieces .",
    "then when hit with @xmath155 only the scalar anisotropic stress survives and the first term of the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eqti2 ] ) becomes @xmath156 .",
    "defining the total energy density of these dark fluids as @xmath157 , it follows that the total density contrast , @xmath158 , is the weighted sum of the individual components @xmath159 and the total velocity is given by @xmath160 where @xmath50 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eost2 ] ) , and the index @xmath52 runs over all dark components . using these two last equations",
    "it is straightforward to show that the hydrodynamical equations for the total fluid are    @xmath161    and @xmath162 where @xmath163 .",
    "these are exactly the equations of a single noninteracting fluid , eqs .",
    "( [ pertd ] ) and ( [ pertt ] ) . the adiabatic speed of sound of the total fluid is @xmath164 .",
    "thus , by forcing the condition @xmath165 we obtain that @xmath166 , and if each dark component has positive energy ( @xmath167 ) , it also implies that @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "therefore , we obtain that the hydrodynamical equations for the total fluid perturbations become the same as the dark fluid perturbations ( eqs .",
    "( [ pertddf2 ] ) and ( [ perttdf2 ] ) ) , under the substitution @xmath170 .",
    "thus , the composed fluid we have constructed is just the dark fluid .    if one considers the unphysical case in which not all dark components have positive energy density , the speed of sound of some components can be different from zero , and the total pressure perturbation is equal to @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the relative entropy perturbation between fluids @xmath52 and @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "therefore , to obtain the dark fluid in the case in which some components have negative energy density we have to impose the pressure perturbations given by eq .",
    "( [ dpt ] ) to be equal to zero .",
    "this condition also implies that the total fluid is barotropic .",
    "in this section we study dark fluid couplings to baryonic matter .",
    "we consider models in which the background cosmology is the same as in the @xmath0cdm model , accordingly we do not allow energy transfer ( @xmath173 ) between the cosmic components .",
    "nevertheless , we allow a momentum transfer different from zero .",
    "thus , the interactions affect the fluids only at first order in perturbation theory .    in this work we will not consider interactions to electromagnetism .",

    "after this time , the ionization fraction @xmath183 falls exponentially and thomson scattering becomes subdominant very quickly .    in fig .",
    "9 we plot the cmb power spectrum for the mean values estimated by the mcmc analysis . the reported difference is @xmath244 .",
    "we note that the three models are well inside the error bars of the binned measurements from wmap seven - year observations results .",
    "nonetheless , at higher multipoles ( @xmath245 ) the three models start to have notable discrepancies .",
    "the higher differences appear in the region @xmath246 , just inside the window in which the primordial power spectrum parameters are expected to be estimated with higher precision ( @xmath247 ) . for @xmath248 secondary anisotropies , mainly the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ,",
    "are expected to dominate the cmb spectrum , while for multipoles @xmath249 the spectrum is more sensible to the other parameters .",
    "these high-@xmath250 power spectrum multipoles will be probed by the planck mission @xcite , so we expect to obtain tighter constraints in the near future .    in this work we have not considered the effect that interactions @xmath242 and @xmath239 could have on big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "this is because our phenomenological model only includes the thermalized cross sections @xmath198 and @xmath199 of elastic collisions , whose strengths are at least 9 orders of magnitude weaker than the thomson scattering at this epoch , and more important , do not annihilate baryons and maintain the baryon - to - photon ratio unaltered .",
    "accordingly , we expect the effect over this process to be quite weak .",
    "in this paper we worked out some properties of the so - called dark degeneracy @xcite : the fact that we can only measure the total energy momentum tensor of the dark sector and any split into different pieces ( as in dark matter and dark energy ) is artificial .",
    "although it could be mathematically convenient .",
    "we start by defining the _ dark fluid _ as a barotropic fluid with speed of sound equal to zero , as in @xcite and , more recently , in @xcite ( for similar approaches see @xcite ) .",
    "this is motivated by astrophysical constraints in the dark matter besides its cosmological properties .",
    "making the speed of sound equal to zero allows dark fluid energy density perturbations to grow at all length scales , as a cold dark matter component does , while it leaves room for a constant pressure different from zero .",
    "astrophysical scenarios forbid this pressure to be very high , but it well could take values of the cosmological critical density today . from the positivity of the energy density of the dark fluid it follows that this pressure has to be negative .",
    "thus , we conclude that the dark fluid could act as dark energy",
    ". then we study the background cosmology for the dark fluid and show that , not surprisingly , the same evolution equations as in the @xmath0cdm model are obtained , leading to a degeneracy between both models .",
    "we conclude that any collection of fluids for which its total equation of state parameter is equal to eq .",
    "( [ eost2 ] ) will lead us to the same result at the background cosmological level .",
    "this is not necessarily the case when we consider linear perturbations . in order to preserve the dark degeneracy we demand that the dark fluid be a perfect fluid . for a barotropic fluid",
    ", this last condition implies that the first order space - space part of the energy momentum tensor is equal to zero .",
    "furthermore , one has to add that the energy momentum flux density is equal to that of the @xmath0cdm .",
    "thus , we have demanded that the energy momentum tensor of the dark fluid be equal to the @xmath0cdm one at first - order in perturbation theory , otherwise the degeneracy is broken .",
    "when considering a collection of multiple interacting fluids and demanding that the adiabatic speed of sound of the total composed fluid be equal to zero , we obtain exactly the perturbation equations of the dark fluid .",
    "this shows that the degeneracy is present also for more complicated dark sector schemes .    from the first five sections , we conclude that there exist an infinity of cosmological models that give exactly the same observational signatures",
    "accordingly , it is fundamentally impossible to elucidate the actual structure of the dark sector .",
    "thus , it is a matter of taste to prefer the @xmath0cdm model over any one of the exposed in this paper . in fact , to economize it is better to take the one fluid choice ( the dark fluid ) as the correct model .",
    "the only hope we have to understand the actual nature of the dark sector , is that it interacts in some way with the particles of the standard model .",
    "of course interactions would in general break the degeneracy , but this is not necessarily true .",
    "this subject is studied in sec .",
    "vi , where we allow the degeneracy of the dark fluid and the @xmath0cdm model in the homogeneous and isotropic cosmology , and then , we try to break it by adding interactions to baryons at first order in perturbations theory .",
    "we show that a general class of interactions defined by eqs .",
    "( [ pertddfc ] ) and ( [ perttdfc ] ) also can be understood as between dark matter and baryons in the @xmath0cdm model context , leading to a new degeneracy , although not with the concordance model , but with a @xmath0cdm - plus - interactions model . as a consequence , these interactions does not help us to favor any decomposition of the dark fluid .    for the latter investigation",
    "we have chosen two independent interactions : one that resembles the thomson scattering between photons and baryons , regulated by a parameter @xmath198 , and a second , density - dependent interaction , inspired by chameleon theories and parametrized by @xmath199 .",
    "for the analysis we have used a combination of the seven - year results of wmap , the union 2 data set compilation of supernovae measurements , and a prior in the hubble constant of the hubble space telescope .",
    "when we consider both interactions together , we obtain that other parameters of the theory differ too much from its standard values , up to almost @xmath251 in the case of the baryonic density parameter @xmath229 .",
    "then , we study the case in which @xmath199 is equal to zero , allowing @xmath198 to vary ( model b ) . here",

    "<S> then , we construct the dark fluid from a collection of interacting fluids . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we try to break the degeneracy with a general class of couplings to baryonic matter . nonetheless , we show that these interactions can also be understood in the context of the @xmath0cdm model as between dark matter and baryons . for this last investigation </S>",
    "<S> we choose two independent parametrizations for the interactions , one inspired by electromagnetism and the other by chameleon theories . </S>",
    "<S> then , we constrain them with a joint analysis of cmb and supernovae observational data . </S>"
