    "collisionless shocks @xcite play an important role in energy transport and evolution of charged - particle distribution functions in space and astrophysical environments .",
    "although collisionless shocks in plasmas were first predicted in the 1950s @xcite and discovered in the 1960s @xcite , many questions relating to the microscopic physics of collisionless shock formation , evolution , and shock acceleration of particles to very high energies remain unanswered @xcite .",
    "laboratory studies of collisionless shocks have been conducted since the 1960s @xcite , but a recent renaissance of laboratory collisionless shock experiments @xcite stems from the fact that modern laboratory plasmas can satisfy key physics criteria for the shocks to have `` cosmic relevance '' @xcite .",
    "recently initiated experiments @xcite at los alamos national laboratory ( lanl ) aim to form and study astrophysically relevant collisionless shocks via the head - on merging of two supersonic plasma jets , each with order 10-cm spatial scale size .",
    "compared to most other modern collisionless shock experiments which use laser - produced or wire - array z - pinch @xcite plasmas , the lanl experiment has larger shock spatial size ( up to 30-cm wide and a few - cm thick ) and longer shock time duration ( order 10  @xmath6s ) but somewhat lower sonic and alfvn mach numbers .",
    "the lanl experiment plans to have the capability to apply magnetic fields of a few kg ( via coils ) that can be oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the direction of shock propagation . obtaining physical insights into and experimental data on collisionless shock structure , evolution , and",
    "their effects on particle dynamics are the primary reasons to conduct laboratory experiments on collisionless shocks .",
    "this paper reports results from particle - in - cell ( pic ) and hybrid - pic numerical simulations , using the lsp code @xcite , that informed the design of the lanl experiment and showed that collisionless shocks should appear with the expected plasma jet parameters .    after a brief description of the lanl collisionless shock experiment",
    ", the remainder of the paper describes single - jet propagation and one- ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) pic head - on merging jet simulations .",
    "our 1d magnetized simulations , in which the jets are immersed in an applied magnetic field , are similar to those of shimada and hoshino @xcite who performed 1d pic simulations of magnetized shock formation using a reduced ion - to - electron mass ratio and a reflection boundary to model counter - propagating plasmas .",
    "we use the actual hydrogen mass ratio and the actual hydrogen plasma parameters expected in the lanl experiments , and we directly simulate both jets .",
    "this gives us the flexibility to independently vary the properties ( _ e.g. _ , the density profile ) of the two jets without assuming any symmetry .",
    "we have also performed 2d cartesian merging simulations of magnetized jets which allows us to consider the effects of the orientation of the magnetic field and plasma density gradients with respect to the jet propagation direction .",
    "these simulations demonstrate shock formation caused by the merging of magnetized jets with mach numbers as low as @xmath7 , where the mach number is defined as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the pre - shock jet velocity in the shock frame , @xmath10 is the alfvn velocity ( in si units ) where @xmath11 is the pre - shock magnetic field strength @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the pre - shock ion density , @xmath13 is the ion mass , and @xmath14 where the @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the pre - shock electron and ion temperatures in energy units .    in unmagnetized plasmas , collisionless shocks may also be formed by the weibel instability @xcite . simulations of this mechanism were described by kato and takabe @xcite , whose simulations were also performed at a reduced mass ratio and were restricted to relatively high velocities ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "when using the hydrogen mass ratio and a lower velocity ( @xmath18 km / s as expected in the experiment ) , we find no shock formation on relevant timescales ( a few @xmath6s ) .",

    "hydrogen , helium , and argon jets have been used in the experiments , but we focus exclusively on hydrogen in this paper due to its ability to better satisfy the physics criteria for cosmically relevant collisionless shocks @xcite .",

    "jets are desired ; this is accomplished primarily by reducing the injected mass for a given gun current .",
    "[ fg : exp ]    the approach used in this numerical study is two - fold .",
    "we initially perform a large - scale simulation of a single jet propagating from the end of the plasma gun to the center of the vacuum chamber .",
    "the hydrogen jets emerge from the plasma gun with densities on the order of @xmath19@xmath1 @xmath2 and temperatures of a few ev .",
    "the jets emerging from the guns will be few centimeters in size ( on the order of the railgun aperture ) with masses of a few @xmath6 g , and will have a drift velocity @xmath18 km / s .",
    "but both must propagate on the order of 1  m before merging can begin , during which time the density , temperature , and equation - of - state ( eos ) of the jet can change . the single - jet propagation simulation models the time evolution of the initial jet as it propagates through the chamber .",
    "this 2d @xmath20@xmath21 simulation must be run for several @xmath6s .",
    "this requires using a fairly large timestep , for which @xmath22 at an initial plasma density @xmath23 @xmath2 , where @xmath24 is the electron plasma frequency .",
    "such simulations must be done with a hybrid - pic approach in which electron plasma oscillations do need not to be resolved .    however , a fully kinetic approach is required to model the formation of shocks due to micro - instabilities induced by jet merging . as will be seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : single - h - jet ] , the hydrogen jets ejected from the plasma guns drop considerably in density as they propagate to the center of the chamber where the merging takes place .",
    "this density reduction during propagation allows us to perform fully kinetic explicit pic merging simulations in 1d and 2d cartesian coordinates , in which electron timescales are resolved ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "so these simulations , which are initialized with plasma parameters obtained from the propagation simulation , are intended to model only the merging process which occurs much later than the ejection of the jets from the guns .",
    "all of these simulations are performed using the hybrid - pic code lsp @xcite , which has been utilized widely and validated for applications in many areas of beam and plasma physics , including streaming instabilities @xcite and landau damping @xcite .",
    "in addition to the traditional pic paradigm , i.e. , a maxwell - vlasov solver for collisionless plasmas in which electron length and time scales must be resolved , lsp also contains algorithms for dense plasma simulation and includes physics modules for collisions ( among charged and neutral species ) , eos modeling , and radiation transport .",
    "this flexibility available in the code makes it useful for the two - fold simulation approach described above .",
