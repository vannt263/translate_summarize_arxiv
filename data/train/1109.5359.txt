    "quark matter at sufficiently high baryon density and low temperature becomes a color superconductor(csc ) @xcite .",
    "csc is characterized by a diquark condensate , which is analogous to the cooper pair in an ordinary superconductor , but the structure of the condensate is much richer because quarks have the nonabelian color and flavor charges .",
    "the structure of the csc states depends sensitively on the number of quark flavors and their masses @xcite .",
    "for very high baryon density , where the masses of u , d and s quarks can be ignored , the ground state is in the color - flavor - locked(cfl ) phase @xcite , where quarks of different flavors pair .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated in moderate density because of the strange quark mass , @xmath1 equilibrium and the charge neutrality conditions . a substantial fermi momentum mismatch among different quark flavors",
    "is introduced and thereby reduces the available phase space for the cross - flavor pairing , such as cfl .",
    "different exotic scenarios for cross - flavor pairing proposed in the literature ( gapless csc , loff csc etc . )",
    "either run into various instabilities @xcite or reduce significantly the condensation energy .",
    "this makes the single flavor pairing , which is free from the fermi momentum mismatch and the instabilities , a competing alternative even though the pairing force here is expected to be weaker .",
    "there are a number of different paring states .",
    "the ones frequently discussed in the literature include the spherical color - spin - lock(csl ) and nonspherical planar , polar and a @xcite . here",
    ", the adjective `` spherical / nonspherical '' refers to the symmetry of the order parameter under a space rotation .",
    "the csl pairing is energetically most favored in the absence of a magnetic field , but the situation changed when a magnetic field is applied .",
    "the single flavor color superconductivity may be realized in the interior of a compact star during the later stage of its life , where a magnetic field is present .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field in the interior of a compact star @xcite will offset the energy balance among the four canonical single flavor pairings .",
    "the spherical csl phase has an electromagnetic meissner effect @xcite , but nonspherical phases : polar , a and planar phases do not .",
    "so if a quark matter of single flavor parings cools down through the critical temperature in a magnetic filed , forming csl state will cost extra work to exclude magnetic fluxes from the bulk .",
    "therefore , the magnetic contribution to the free energy may favor the nonspherical states . in a previous work ,",
    "we have explored the consequences of the absence of the electromagnetic meissner effect in a nonspherical csc phase of single flavor pairing @xcite and have obtained the phase diagram with respect to the magnetic field and the temperature .",
    "we found that under the plausible magnitude of the the magnetic field inside a compact star , the most favored state is not always csl and nonspherical pairing states may show up . for the sake of simplicity , we considered both the infinitely massive limit and the massless limit strange quarks in @xcite .",
    "the former limit is unrealistic given the typical chemical potential @xmath2 around 500mev , the latter requires the mass of strange quarks , @xmath3 , to be much lower than quark chemical potential .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath3 has to be sufficiently large in order to win the competition with exotic cross - flavor pairings such as gapless csc and loff .",
    "both requirements may be compromised marginally for the value of @xmath3 in vacuum ( @xmath4 150mev ) but will be problematic when the value of @xmath3 in medium becomes comparable with @xmath2 as was suggested by some numerical works such as @xcite .",
    "all these concerns warrant a systematic treatment of the single flavor pairing with an arbitrary quark mass .",
    "so we did in this paper .    in the present work , we shall give a detailed investigation of the phase structure .",
    "for this purpose , we formulate the single flavor csc for an nonzero quark mass in terms of the same njl(nambu - jona - lasinio)-like effective action employed in @xcite and introduce the mean - field approximation for an arbitrary mass in section 2 . unlike the ultra - relativistic limit , where the cross - helicity(transverse ) pairing dominates , the nonzero quark mass couples the cross helicity pairing channel and the equal - helicity(longitudinal ) pairing channel and thereby complicates the gap matrix underlying the excitation spectrum . fortunately , as will be shown in section 3 , the gap matrix for an arbitrary mass can still be diagonalized analytically for all four canonical phases and our results interpolate both the ultra - relativistic limit and the non - relativistic limit in the literature .",
    "the ranking of the condensation energy in the massless limit remains intact when a nonzero quark mass is switched on . in section 4",
    "we generalize our analysis in @xcite of a three - flavor quark matter beyond the ultra - relativistic limit .",
    "because the transition temperature of the nonzero @xmath3 strange quark paring is reduced , phase diagram with respect to temperature and magnetic field contains a region where only u and d flavors condensate .",
    "the size of this region is tiny for @xmath5mev but can not be ignored for @xmath6 .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and remark on some open issues in section 5 . throughout the paper , we shall assume zero masses for u and d quarks as we did in @xcite .",
    "all gamma matrices are hermitian according to our notation .",
    "in this section and the next one , we shall formulate the single flavor copper pairing with an arbitrary quark mass .",
    "the lagrangian density of the njl - like effective action reads @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 with @xmath9 the @xmath10th gell - mann matrix , @xmath11 is the quark mass and @xmath2 is the chemical potential .",

    "we have @xmath28 where the @xmath29 antisymmetric matrix @xmath30 in color space is defined by @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 and they coincide with the matrix representation of the angular momentum operators of spin one with respect to cartesian basis .",

    "furthermore , the gap energy associated to spin - one cooper pairing is expected much smaller than the chemical potential .",

    "there is a second order phase transition from three flavor condensate to two flavor condensate at transition temperature @xmath163 where strange quarks condense .",
    "the phase boundaries in the two regions join smoothly . as an order of magnitude estimate , we calibrated our model @xmath235 against the that from the qcd one - gluon exchange in the chiral limit and found the typical magnitude of the magnetic field in the phase diagram falls within the range of the plausible magnetic field inside a compact star in the literature .",
    "on the other hand , the effective lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) we employed in this paper is by no means the most general one .",
    "the lorentz covariance of ( [ lag ] ) is unlikely in a medium and the coupling @xmath283 may depends on @xmath3 .",
    "taking the one - gluon exchange as a reference , the screenings of the color magnetic channel and the color electric one by the medium are very different and should depends the masses of quarks .",
    "these properties is likely to persists qualitatively at the moderate density and should be reflected in the effective action to some extents .",
    "also , the inequality ( [ equa ] ) may not be as robust as people thought .",
    "a purely ginzburg - landau analysis @xcite reveals some parameter region where the ranking ( [ equa ] ) is offset even without a magnetic field .",
    "the microscopic mechanism supporting this observation , based on the most general four - fermion effective action or others , remains to be unveiled .    throughout this paper , we take the massless limit of @xmath284 and @xmath285 flavors and then gapless excitations exist in all i - iv phases of table.i .",
    "in reality , the chiral restoration transition from low density to high density may be a crossover and @xmath284 and @xmath285 quarks may also acquire nonzero masses from the chiral condensate .",
    "consequently , the excitations of the phase i where all flavors are in csl will be gapped .",
    "this is welcome since it will slow down the direct urca processes of cooling in a compact star by spin-1 csc alone @xcite .",
    "but the gapless modes remains for nonspherical states and phase diagrams fig.2 are still valid qualitatively .",
    "therefore the magnetic field inside the star can not exceed the magnitude along the border line between i and ii of fig.2 for a slow cooling process .",
    "the authors are grateful to thomas sch@xmath286fer for a communication on the nr limit .",
    "we would like to extend our gratitude to bo feng for useful discussions .",
