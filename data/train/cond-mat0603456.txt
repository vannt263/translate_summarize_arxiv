    "<S> we show that the electron transmittivity of single electrons propagating along a 1d wire in the presence of two magnetic impurities is affected by the entanglement between the impurity spins . for suitable values of the electron wave vector , </S>",
    "<S> there are two maximally entangled spin states which respectively make the wire completely transparent whatever the electron spin state , or strongly inhibits electron transmission .    </S>",
    "<S> the key role that entanglement plays not only in most quantum information processing tasks @xcite but also in a broad range of physical processes such as quantum transport @xcite has been considerably clarified over the past few years . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the interplay between entanglement and single - electron transport properties in a 1d wire in the presence of two scattering magnetic impurities . </S>",
    "<S> such system is the electron analogue of a fabry - perot ( fp ) interferometer @xcite , with the two impurities playing the role of two mirrors with a quantum degree of freedom : the spin . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests the interesting question whether entanglement between the impurity spins plays any role in modulating the transmittivity . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this is indeed the case . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we will show that , under simple suitable circumstances , the maximally entangled bell states @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the scattering centers spins can either largely inhibit the electron transport or make the wire completely  transparent \" . </S>",
    "<S> such striking behaviour , which can be intuitively understood in terms of quantum interference , is here quantitatively analyzed in terms of constants of motion . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we will show that the same scattering mechanism can be used to efficiently create the entanglement between the impurity spins .    </S>",
    "<S> let us assume to inject single conduction electrons into a clean 1d wire - such as a semiconductor quantum wire @xcite or a single - wall carbon nanotube @xcite - into which two spatially separated , identical spin-1/2 magnetic impurities are embedded ( e.g. these could be realized by two quantum dots @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> due to the presence of an exchange interaction , the conduction electron undergoes multiple scattering with the impurities before being finally transmitted or reflected . </S>",
    "<S> let us also assume that the electron spin state can be prepared at the input of the wire and measured at its output ( this could be achieved through ferromagnetic contacts at the source and drain of the wire @xcite ) . to be more specific , consider a 1d wire along the @xmath2 direction with the two magnetic impurities , labeled 1 and 2 , embedded at @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the conduction electrons are injected one at a time ( this allows us to neglect many - body effects ) and that they can occupy only the lowest subband , the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the electron momentum operator , effective mass and spin-1/2 operator respectively , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the spin-1/2 operator of the @xmath11-th impurity and @xmath12 is the exchange spin - spin coupling constant between the electron and each impurity . </S>",
    "<S> all the spin operators are in units of @xmath13 . since the electron - impurity collisions are elastic , the energy eigenvalues are simply @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) where @xmath16 is a good quantum number . </S>",
    "<S> as the total spin hilbert space is 8-dimensional and considering left - incident electrons , it turns out that to each value of @xmath16 there corresponds an 8-fold degenerate energy level . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath17 be the total spin of the system . since @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with quantum numbers @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , are constants of motion , @xmath22 can be block diagonalized , each block corresponding to an eigenspace of fixed @xmath20 ( for three spins 1/2 , the possible values of @xmath20 are @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> let us rewrite eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h ] ) in the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( @xmath10 ) is the total spin of the electron and the @xmath11-th impurity . </S>",
    "<S> note that , in general @xmath27 and @xmath28 do not commute . </S>",
    "<S> here we choose as spin space basis the states @xmath29 , common eigenstates of @xmath28 , @xmath30 and @xmath19 , to express , for a fixed @xmath16 , each of the eight stationary states of the system as an 8-dimensional column . to calculate the transmission probability amplitude @xmath31 that an electron prepared in the incoming state @xmath32 will be transmitted in a state @xmath33 we have derived the exact stationary states of the system . to do this , the quantum waveguide theory approach of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for an electron scattering with a magnetic impurity has been properly generalized to the case of two impurities . </S>",
    "<S> note that due to the form of @xmath22 ( see eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ h2 ] ) coefficients @xmath31 do not depend on @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first consider the subspace @xmath35 . since in this subspace @xmath27 and @xmath28 commute , the states @xmath36 are also eigenstates of @xmath27 and the effective electron - impurities potential in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h2 ] ) reduces to @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the two impurities behave as if they were static and the scattering between electron and impurities can not flip the spins . </S>",
    "<S> the four stationary states take therefore the simple form @xmath38 , where @xmath39 describes the electron orbital degrees of freedom and can be easily found imposing suitable boundary conditions at @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to calculate the transmission probability amplitude @xmath40 which turns out to depend on the two dimensionless parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the density of states per unit length of the wire @xcite . here , given length limitations , we shall omit its explicit form </S>",
    "<S> .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the @xmath44 subspace . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 and @xmath46 do not commute . </S>",
    "<S> this is a signature of the fact that in this space spin - flip can occur . in each of the two - dimensional @xmath47 subspaces , </S>",
    "<S> the two stationary states are of the form @xmath48 where the index @xmath49 indicates that the incident spin state of ( [ ansatz ] ) is @xmath50 . in this subspace </S>",
    "<S> the 8-dimensional column representing each eigenstate of @xmath22 has therefore two non - vanishing components . </S>",
    "<S> the transmitted part of ( [ ansatz ] ) is given by @xmath51 $ ] where again the four coefficients @xmath52 depend on the two parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> note that since in the @xmath44 subspace @xmath46 is not conserved , unlike the @xmath35 case , @xmath53 for @xmath54 .    </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge of all the exact transmission amplitudes @xmath55 allows us to determine , at all orders in the coupling constant @xmath12 , how an incident wave @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is an arbitrary overall spin state , is transmitted after scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the state @xmath56 is the incident part of the stationary state @xmath58 where @xmath59 for @xmath35 , while @xmath49 for @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the overall electron transmittivity @xmath60 is obtained by expressing the transmitted part of each stationary state @xmath61 in terms of @xmath55 , rearranging ( [ sviluppochi ] ) as a linear expansion in the basis @xmath62 and then summing the squared modules of the coefficients of the expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we are now able to investigate how electron transmission depends on the state in which the two impurities are prepared . </S>",
    "<S> let us start with the following family of impurity spins states @xmath63 with @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this family includes both maximally entangled and product states . </S>",
    "<S> the electron transmittivity @xmath60 when the injected electron spin state is @xmath66 with the impurities prepared in the product states @xmath67 and @xmath68 is plotted in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1a and 1b , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> a behaviour similar to a fp interferometer with partially silvered mirrors , with equally spaced maxima of transmittivity , is exhibited . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a principal maxima occur around a value of @xmath69 which tends to @xmath70 for increasing values of @xmath42 , while in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b they occur at @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath42 is increased , maxima get lower and lower and sharpen . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , in both cases the electron and impurities spin state is changed after the scattering and the electron undergoes a loss of coherence , since we always have @xmath71 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar behaviour with decoherence occurs when the two impurity spins are prepared in the maximally entangled state @xmath72 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) . </S>",
    "<S> again the transmitted spin state differs from the incident one and , in particular , when @xmath70 , it turns out to be a linear combination of @xmath73 and @xmath74 .    </S>",
    "<S> a striking behaviour however appears when the impurity spins are prepared in the maximally entangled state @xmath75 : as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b , the wire becomes  transparent \" for @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words perfect transmittivity @xmath77 is reached at @xmath76 regardless of the value of @xmath42 , with peaks getting narrower for increasing values of @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , under the resonance condition @xmath76 , the spin state @xmath78 is transmitted unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> note that this occurs even if @xmath79 belongs to the @xmath44 subspace where spin - flip is allowed . </S>",
    "<S> using the explicit form of @xmath80 it can be proved that for @xmath76 the only spin state which is transmitted unchanged is @xmath81 , with arbitrary complex values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the wire becomes transparent regardless of the electron spin state . </S>",
    "<S> this effect , clearly due to constructive quantum interference , can be quantitatively analyzed in terms of hamiltonian symmetries . denoting by @xmath84 and @xmath85 the effective representations of @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively , in a subspace of fixed energy @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> , it can be easily proved that @xmath88 for @xmath89 . when this occurs the non - kinetic part @xmath90 of @xmath22 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h ] ) assumes the effective representation @xmath91 where @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that , for @xmath89 , @xmath93 ( with quantum number @xmath94 ) becomes a constant of motion . </S>",
    "<S> this is physically reasonable since the condition @xmath89 implies that the electron is found at @xmath3 and @xmath4 with equal probability and , as a consequence , the two impurities are equally coupled to the electron spin . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath90 turns out to vanish for @xmath44 and @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case for the initial state @xmath81 as this is an eigenstate of @xmath30 and @xmath96 with quantum numbers @xmath44 and @xmath95 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , when this state is prepared and @xmath89 , no spin - flip occurs and the wire becomes transparent . </S>",
    "<S> this is not the case for the state @xmath97 belonging to the degenerate 2-dimensional eigenspace of @xmath96 and @xmath98 with quantum numbers @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively . as a consequence , when @xmath76 , the transmitted spin state will result in a linear combination of @xmath97 and @xmath74 , implying spin - flip and decoherence . to further illustrate these results </S>",
    "<S> we have plotted the transmittivity @xmath60 when the electron is injected in an arbitrary spin state @xmath101 with the impurities prepared in a state ( [ family2 ] ) as a function of @xmath102 and @xmath103 , for @xmath76 and @xmath104 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . note how the electron transmission depends crucially on the relative phase @xmath103 between the impurity spin states @xmath67 and @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value of @xmath60 occurs when the impurities are prepared in the singlet state @xmath105 , while its minima occur for the triplet state @xmath106 .     </S>",
    "<S> electron transmittivity @xmath60 at @xmath89 and @xmath107 when the electron is injected in an arbitrary spin state @xmath101 with the impurities prepared in the state @xmath108 . ]    as we have discussed , @xmath71 ( it gets smaller and smaller for increasing values of @xmath109 ) for @xmath106 due to decoherence effects . </S>",
    "<S> since the set of states ( [ family2 ] ) is spanned by @xmath105 and @xmath106 , the transmittivity for a generic state ( [ family2 ] ) will have intermediate values between the value of @xmath60 for @xmath106 and 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the most remarkable result emerging from the above discussion is that , within the set of initial impurity spins states ( [ family2 ] ) , maximally entangled states @xmath105 and @xmath106 have the relevant property to maximize or minimize electron transmission . </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen @xmath107 to better highlight this behaviour , but this happens for any value of @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this result suggests the appealing possibility to use the relative phase @xmath103 as a control parameter to modulate the electron transmission in a 1d wire .    </S>",
    "<S> for this task to be correctly performed , it is required that the state @xmath0 in which the impurities must be prepared to inhibit electron transmission , can be protected from spin - flip events . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved if the electron is injected in a fixed spin state , let us say @xmath66 , and analyzed in the same state when transmitted . </S>",
    "<S> let us denote by @xmath110 the conditional probability that the electron is transmitted in the state @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> in figs . 4a and </S>",
    "<S> 4b we have plotted @xmath60 and @xmath110 , respectively , for an initial impurity spins state ( [ family2 ] ) with the electron injected in the state @xmath66 and for @xmath111 and @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> note how the filtering can be used to efficiently reduce the electron transmission with the impurities prepared in the state @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> we found that @xmath113 for high values of @xmath42 as in fig . 3 for @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> thus in these cases no spin - filtering is required .    </S>",
    "<S> the above features are however not present for all sets of maximally entangled states . </S>",
    "<S> let us for instance consider the family of initial impurity spins states @xmath114 with @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that , in this case , the two impurities behave as if they were prepared in a statistical mixture of @xmath115 and @xmath116 with weights @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 5a , 5b and 5c for the cases @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , respectively , with arbitrary @xmath103 and the electron injected spin state being @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the phase @xmath103 thus plays no role and no interesting interference effect occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this is that @xmath122 and @xmath123 are eigenstates of the constant of motion @xmath19 with different quantum numbers @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively and therefore , unlike the set of states ( [ family2 ] ) , no quantum interference effects are possible . </S>",
    "<S> finally , note that while in the cases of figs . 5b and 5c a loss of electron coherence </S>",
    "<S> is exhibited similarly to the cases of figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1a , 1b and 2a , a coherent behaviour completely analogous to a fp interferometer with partially silvered mirrors @xcite is observed when the impurities are prepared in the state @xmath115 with the electron injected in the state @xmath66 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5a ) . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , the spin state @xmath122 belongs to the non degenerate eigenspace @xmath35 , @xmath124 where spin - flip does not occur and the impurities behave as they were static . </S>",
    "<S> however , we note that at variance with the case of fig . 2b , @xmath77 for values of @xmath41 which depend on @xmath42 and only if the electron spin is initially aligned with the spins of the impurities .        to conclude we show how </S>",
    "<S> the scattering itself can be used to generate the desired entanglement between the impurity spins . to modulate the electron transmission we are interested in generating either a @xmath0 or a @xmath1 state . </S>",
    "<S> such states can be easily transformed into each other by simply introducing a relative phase shift through a local field . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath0 state can be generated by injecting an electron in the state @xmath66 with the two impurities prepared in the state @xmath116 , in the spirit of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath89 , due to conservation of @xmath93 and @xmath19 the transmitted spin state will be a linear combination of @xmath123 and @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> an output filter selecting only transmitted electrons in the state @xmath127 can thus be used to project the impurities into the state @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> the conditional probability @xmath128 for this event is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 6 as a function of @xmath42 .     </S>",
    "<S> conditional electron transmittivity @xmath128 at @xmath89 as a function of @xmath42 when the electron is injected in the state @xmath66 with the impurities prepared in the state @xmath116 . ]    a probability larger than 20% can be reached with @xmath129 .    to estimate the feasibility of the device here proposed , </S>",
    "<S> let us assume an electron effective mass of @xmath130 ( as in gaas quantum wires ) and the impurities to be two quantum dots each one of size 1 nm . </S>",
    "<S> as a consequence , the maximum electron energy allowing to assume a contact electron - dot potential - as in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h ] ) - is around 2 mev . in this case , for @xmath131 we obtain @xmath132 1 ev which appears to be a reasonable value .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we would like to point out that the above main result showed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 opens the possibility of a new maximally entangled states detection scheme . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , electron transmission can be used as a probe to detect maximally entangled singlet and triplet states of two localized spins within the family ( [ family2 ] ) . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it should be clear from the above discussion that in the case of @xmath1 this would be a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) detection scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , in this article we have considered a 1d wire into which single electrons are injected . </S>",
    "<S> such electrons undergo multiple scattering with two spin-1/2 magnetic impurities embedded at a fixed distance before leaving the wire . </S>",
    "<S> we have derived the exact stationary states of the system thus obtaining all the necessary transmission probability amplitudes to describe electron transport . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that for suitable electron wave vectors ( independent on the electron - impurity coupling constant ) perfect transmittivity without spin - flip takes place provided the impurity spins are prepared in the singlet maximally entangled state . in this regime , </S>",
    "<S> singlet and triplet entangled states of the localized spins are found to maximize and minimize , respectively , electron transmission . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests the appealing idea to use entanglement as a tool to control electron transmission through a wire . </S>"
