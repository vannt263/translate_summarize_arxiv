    "spiral galaxies contain substantial amounts of cold interstellar matter ( ism ) and ongoing star formation , while cold ism is but a minor component of elliptical galaxies .",
    "this is generally attributed to early exhaustion of the ism in ellipticals during the early stages of galaxy formation .",
    "however , mass loss during stellar evolution @xcite can replenish the ism to detectable levels in much less than a hubble time , and ism present in ellipticals can be attributed to stellar mass loss or to accretion from outside .    the mass loss from evolved stars is estimated to be @xmath7 per year per @xmath8 of optical luminosity @xcite and indeed is observed to take place as cold molecular gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , ism contents comparable to those of spiral galaxies could be accumulated in elliptical galaxies in of order @xmath9 years .",
    "however , @xcite point out that the cold gas and stellar contents of elliptical galaxies are uncorrelated , and conclude that the cold gas comes from outside through events such as mergers . on the other hand , many elliptical galaxies contain of order @xmath10 to @xmath11 of hot gas , detected by its x - ray emission @xcite , which could originate in collisionally - heated mass shed by dying stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "knowledge of the cold - gas content of normal elliptical galaxies is crucial to these questions .",
    "several such surveys have been made @xcite using the co(10 ) and co(21 ) rotational lines as probes .",
    "however , all of these studies have concentrated on ellipticals which are detected at 100 microns by iras , and are therefore biased .",
    "the present paper discusses observations of 15 nearby elliptical galaxies selected independently of their infrared emission .",
    "these observations were made of the co(32 ) line , which in addition to providing information on the presence of molecular gas allows an evaluation of its physical condition from multi - transition measurements ( cf .",
    "we carried out @xmath0co(@xmath132 ) ( hereafter co(32 ) ) observations of fifteen elliptical galaxies using the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) , a 10 m antenna located at pampa la bola in the atacama desert in chile at an altitude of 4800 m @xcite .",
    "the observations were made on august 2124 2006 from the remote aste operations room at the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) using the network operation system n - cosmos 3 developed at the national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) @xcite .",
    "the front end is a cartridge - type 350 ghz receiver operated in double - sideband mode with an intermediate frequency ( if ) between 5 and 7 ghz .",
    "the antenna temperature and sky extinction were measured using the standard chopper - wheel method .",
    "the antenna beam size is @xmath12 at 345 ghz .",
    "we used three digital spectrometers with a bandwidth of 512 mhz ( 445 km s@xmath13 at 345 ghz ) and 1024 channels .",
    "the same center frequency was set for these spectrometers .",
    "a velocity resolution was 0.53 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the pointing was monitored by observations of the bright line sources afgl 3068 and @xmath14 ceti , and was accurate to 5 \" .",
    "the main beam efficiency @xmath15 was measured each day by observations of w51d using the peak intensity measured by @xcite and was constant at 0.54 .",
    "the observed galaxies were selected from the catalogue of @xcite to lie in the right ascension range 22h - 7h and between declinations of @xmath16 degrees ",
    "@xmath17 degrees ( so that the galaxies can be observed from both the northern and southern hemispheres ) , to have recession velocities less than 5000 km s@xmath13 and to be classified as ellipticals rather than as s0s or of later types .",
    "no other criterion was used for thirteen of the galaxies , so they are unbiased .",
    "in addition , two infrared - bright dwarf ellipticals , ngc 855 and ngc 2328 , were observed . in these galaxies ,",
    "co(10 ) and co(21 ) emission have been observed and the line widths are less than 445 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the observed galaxies are listed in table 1 .",
    "the data reduction was carried out with tasks in newstar , a package developed at nro .",
    "individual bad data were flagged , the remaining spectra averaged , and first - order baselines were removed .",
    "the calibrated spectra were smoothed by 46 channels to a velocity resolution of 19.8 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the typical rms noise levels , @xmath18 , for the smoothed spectra were 8 mk .",

    "both co(10 ) and co(21 ) emission have been detected from ngc 855 @xcite .",

    "the beam sizes used for the co(32 ) and co(10 ) are the same , 22 \" , while the beam size for the co(21 ) observation is @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the true value of @xmath55 might be a factor 1 to 4 lower , while @xmath5 can be considered as the true value .",
    "the value of @xmath5 is larger than the mean observed for three other elliptical galaxies ( 0.2 , @xcite ) , but similar to values observed for spiral and starburst galaxies ( mauersberger et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) of ngc 855 is about @xmath56 yr@xmath13 @xcite , higher than that of most elliptical galaxies and similar to values observed for spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "this suggests that @xmath5 correlates with star formation efficiency , as noted from mapping of m83 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since we have data for three co rotational in ngc 855 , the mean properties of the molecular ism can be modelled .",
    "first , we assume lte and that all three co lines are optically thick .",
    "the brightness temperature , @xmath57 , is then @xmath58 where @xmath59 is planck s constant , @xmath60 is frequency , @xmath61 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath62 is the kinetic temperature . applying equation ( 2 ) to the observed line ratios for ngc 855 implies a kinetic temperature of 8 k , which is far lower than the dust temperature of 33 k estimated by @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we modelled the emission using the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) model @xcite .",
    "we calculated line ratios for kinetic temperatures from 10  100 k , h@xmath63 densities from 10 to @xmath64 @xmath6 , and co abundances @xmath65 of @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 pc km@xmath13 s. the resulting line ratios @xmath5 and @xmath55 are shown in figure [ lvg ] .",

    "the co(10 ) line is optically thick at this density , as was assumed in estimating the molecular mass from equation ( 1 ) .      using the calculated mean density",
    ", we can estimate the volume of the molecular gas and its diameter , assuming a spherical distribution .",
    "we used a mean h@xmath63 density of 650 @xmath6 for all three detected elliptical galaxies .",
    "the results are given in table 3 .",
    "the molecular content in ngc 855 is as much as a single galactic giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) , which can support the existence of the star formation in this galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the size is smaller than the beam size of co(21 ) ( @xmath54 ) , which corresponds to 440 pc at 8.3 mpc .",
    "therefore , @xmath55 would be 4 times smaller ( i.e. , @xmath70 ) , if ngc 855 had only one gmc .",
    "the lvg calculation can not satisfy @xmath71 and @xmath70 at the same time , if this was the case .",
    "the curve of @xmath71 always coincides with that of @xmath72 .    considering these matters ,",
    "the molecular distribution is likely to be more extended than the beam size @xmath12 , forming smaller clumps rather than one gmc .",
    "two of the elliptical galaxies ( ngc 990 and ngc 1550 ) in which we detected molecular gas are not detected by iras , though iras 100@xmath73 m upper limit of ngc 990 is pretty high .",
    "thus cold molecular ism may be more common in ellipticals than previously thought .",
