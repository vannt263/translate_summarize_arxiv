    "few phenomena in modern astrophysics exhibit the maddening combination of theoretical ubiquity and observational elusiveness as the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) .",
    "although it is effectively a generic prediction of hydrodynamic simulations , containing up to 50% of the baryons in the low - redshift universe @xcite , decisive observational confirmation of its existence has yet to be found . at high redshifts ,",
    "the igm has long been assayed through measurements of the lyman - alpha forest . at @xmath1 , however , this forest progressively thins to a desert : ultraviolet spectra of bright quasars reveal drastically fewer absorbers resulting in an inferred local baryon density far below what is seen at high redshift .",
    "this discrepancy is often described as a problem of `` missing baryons . ''",
    "of course , the matter traced by the high - redshift ly@xmath2 forest has not vanished , but instead has become ionized ( through shock heating and photoionization from the uv / x - ray background ) to the point where essentially no neutral hydrogen is left .",
    "fortunately , at typical whim temperatures and densities ( @xmath3k and @xmath4@xmath5 , respectively ) , species of common metals like carbon , oxygen , and neon retain a few electrons , in principle allowing uv and x - ray absorption line studies of the whim at @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "such measurements are challenging ( particularly at x - ray wavelengths ) ; nonetheless , several x - ray forest lines have been reported in blind searches with ultra - deep  and _ xmm _ spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "while blind searches provide an unbiased census of the uv / x - ray absorber population , _ targeted _ observations reveal important information about the nature of the systems themselves . @xcite",
    "successfully employed this tactic with deep spectroscopy of the x - ray bright @xmath7 quasar h@xmath8 ( h2356 hereafter ) , a system which has proven to be a rich laboratory for connecting putative igm lines to large - scale galaxy structures .",
    "not only did they detect an ovii absorption line ( corresponding to @xmath9k gas ) at the redshift of the sculptor wall supercluster ( @xmath10 ) , but follow - up studies on the same sightline by @xcite and @xcite confirmed this initial detection and found two new x - ray absorption systems associated with higher - redshift walls .",
    "conversely , @xcite associated a @xmath11mpc galaxy filament with a previously - detected x - ray absorber .",
    "while the number of detected systems is yet small , the emerging picture seems to be that warm - hot gas pervades such large - scale structures .    however , individual galaxies also host warm - hot , extended coronae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as do low - mass galaxy groups @xcite .",
    "as with any absorption - line study , full spectroscopic information about virialized structures near the line of sight ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is critical to our interpretation of the detected lines . to this end",
    ", we are undertaking a survey of galaxies around four quasars where intervening x - ray absorption systems have been reported ; here we present initial results from the h2356 sightline . a concordance @xmath12cdm cosmology with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15kms@xmath16mpc@xmath16 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ( hereafter b09 and z10 respectively ) analyzed   and _ xmm - newton _ grating observations of h2356 ; b09 using a combined @xmath17 ksec in letg and xmm  rgs , and z10 using a total of 600ksec of letg observations .",
    "b09 reported the detection of a significant  k@xmath2 absorption line at the redshift of the @xmath10 sculptor wall ( later confirmed with deeper data by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "subsequently , z10 jointly analyzed these spectra with the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) catalog to search for whim near other large - scale structures , detecting low - significance candidate absorption systems near the pisces - cetus supercluster ( @xmath18 ) and the farther sculptor wall ( @xmath19 ) . in a more recent study , @xcite reported yet another x - ray absorption line , cv at @xmath20 .",
    "interestingly , this one appears to lie in a relatively empty region with the nearest galaxies @xmath21mpc away , and its redshift is marginally consistent with a large - scale filament of galaxies .    for our analysis",
    ", we extract galaxies in a @xmath22 region centered on h2356 ( @xmath23 ) from the 2dfgrs .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath24mpc at @xmath10 , the redshift of the nearest absorption system . since the 2dfgrs is incomplete at faint magnitudes and in crowded regions , we supplemented these public datasets with our own multi - object spectroscopic survey around this quasar . for this we employed the inamori - magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ;",
    "* ) on the 6.5 m magellan - baade telescope in f/2 mode with a circular , 27@xmath25 diameter field of view .",
    "bright galaxies were selected from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , while fainter ones very close to the sightline were taken from our own magellan imaging .",
    "masks were observed for at least 1 hour each , employing a 300 lines mm@xmath16 grism covering 3900 - 10000  at a dispersion of 1.34 pixel@xmath16 .",
    "spectra were reduced and fit using the techniques employed by @xcite .",
    "ultimately we obtained redshifts for 226 galaxies . between redshifts from the literature and our own survey ,",
    "our sample is at least @xmath26% complete to @xmath27 , which corresponds to relatively faint absolute magnitudes ( @xmath28 , and @xmath29 at @xmath30 , and @xmath31 respectively ) .",
    "however , most of these apparently faint galaxies are at high redshifts ( @xmath32 ) . through the combination of 2df and imacs spectra , selected from a variety of imaging data sets ,",
    "it is unlikely that our sample is missing faint galaxies near ( or bright galaxies farther from ) the absorbers .",
    "since galaxies , groups , clusters , and large - scale filaments and walls are not mutually exclusive classifications , it is often difficult ( or impossible ) to uniquely categorize an absorption line as arising from any one nearby structure ( particularly when precise velocities are not available , as is the case with x - ray spectroscopy ) .",
    "however , it is possible to search for commonalities over an ensemble of systems ; e.g. , whether a _ specific type _ of galaxy or galactic system is typically found near the warm - hot gas . broadly speaking",
    ", more massive galaxies and groups will contain more gas at larger extents , and so their warm - hot gas may be detected at higher impact parameters than that in low - mass galaxies . to take this into account ,",
    "in the following analysis we adopt the host dark matter halo s virial radius as a rough dividing line for `` associated '' vs. `` unassociated '' systems .",
    "although this line is somewhat arbitrary , recent theoretical studies suggest that using @xmath33 should be a reasonable ( or even conservative ) criterion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the virial radii of dark matter halos with @xcite profiles scale with mass according to the following simple relation : @xmath34 where @xmath35 in the concordance @xmath12cdm cosmology . following @xcite , for each galaxy in the 2df sample we estimate @xmath36 from the @xcite @xmath37minimum @xmath38 relation .",
    "sdss @xmath39 magnitudes are estimated with the formula @xmath40 which is derived from the color transformations given in @xcite and @xcite ; @xmath41 and @xmath42 are photographic supercosmos magnitudes .",
    "these magnitudes have large absolute uncertainties ( @xmath43 at @xmath44 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , since @xmath45 these errors typically correspond to just @xmath46% uncertainties on @xmath33 . for comparison purposes ,",
    "we additionally adopt the characteristic @xmath47band magnitude @xmath48 derived from sdss by @xcite .",
    "a significant fraction of low - redshift galaxies reside in low - mass , virialized groups , many of which have substantial reservoirs of warm - hot gas . to determine whether any of the x - ray absorbers are hosted in group - scale halos , we incorporate the 2dfgrs group catalog by ( * ?",
    "* hereafter y05 ) into our analysis . in this catalog , halo masses",
    "are assigned using mass - to - light ratios inferred from the conditional luminosity function ; this catalog is complete to @xmath49m@xmath50 at @xmath51 .",
    "we use the y05 halo masses and equation 1 to compute group virial radii , taking the luminosity - weighted average position of the member galaxies in each group as the halo center and redshift .",
    "a strong  absorption line at a redshift consistent with the sculptor wall was first reported by b09 and later confirmed by @xcite , who measured a column density of @xmath52 .",
    "figure  [ fig_image ] shows a close - up ukst red image of the quasar field with the nearest @xmath53 galaxies circled in cyan ( each galaxy s @xmath33 denoted by the circle s radius ) .",
    "although previous studies conclude that the absorption is associated with whim gas permeating the superstructure , in fact the 2df survey shows an individual low - luminosity ( @xmath54 ) galaxy at the same redshift , 90 projected kpc to the north .",
    "additionally , a significantly brighter ( @xmath55 ) , early - type galaxy lies 240kpc to the east .",
    "these galaxies have inferred @xmath56kpc and 350kpc , respectively , so in principle the warm - hot gas traced by the  could inhabit either halo ( or both ) . note that this more massive galaxy is also listed as a single - member group in the y05 catalog ( see figure  [ fig_grpsky ] ) . although our imacs spectroscopy confirmed the 2df redshift of the nearer galaxy , no additional nearby galaxies at this redshift were found .",
    "z10 searched for x - ray absorption systems at the redshift of this large - scale filament . while no individual lines were found , by jointly fitting several marginally - detected ( @xmath57 ) lines and upper limits they infer the presence of warm - hot ( @xmath58 ) gas near the supercluster redshift .",
    "interestingly , they also report tentative evidence for a separate hotter ( @xmath59 ) phase , albeit at @xmath60 confidence .",
    "the 2dfgrs catalog reveals a @xmath61 disk galaxy at the absorber redshift with impact parameter 49kpc and virial radius 197kpc ( shown in figure  [ fig_image ] as a magenta cross and circle ) ; thus , the absorber is again well within the projected virial radius of the galaxy .",
    "our imacs survey reveals several other galaxies within 1mpc , but none are likely to be associated with the absorber ( figure  [ fig_imacs ] ) .",
    "this absorption system was also detected by z10 through a joint fit to the  spectrum over several ionic species ; its significance appears to be the most marginal of the three ( with inferred @xmath62 ) .",
    "nonetheless , the y05 catalog includes a group of three galaxies 724kpc from the absorber , with a halo mass @xmath63m@xmath50 and @xmath64kpc ( figure  [ fig_grpsky ] ) .",
    "formally the absorber lies within the group s projected virial radius ; however , given the uncertainties involved , we can at most conclude that the hot gas at this redshift is marginally associated with the group halo .",
    "our imacs data show several previously uncatalogued galaxies within 2mpc of the absorber .",
    "none is individually close enough to be associated with the hot gas ; strikingly , however , they appear to form a sub - filament within the larger - scale structure of this wall , nearly centered on the quasar line of sight ( figure  [ fig_imacs ] ) . the warm - hot gas at this redshift may therefore be associated either with the nearby group , the larger - scale filament ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or a combination of both .      in their recent reanalysis of the h2356  spectrum , @xcite reported a @xmath65 cv absorption line at @xmath66 ; notably , the nearest galaxy in 2df at this redshift is about 2.2mpc away .",
    "they instead associate the absorber with a @xmath67mpc large - scale filament of galaxies , marginally consistent in redshift , that passes near the line of sight .",
    "we have checked our imacs data for galaxies at this redshift that 2df may have missed ; while two galaxies indeed fall somewhat closer to the absorber ( 800 and 1700 projected kpc ) , their luminosities are low ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively ) .",
    "the brightest of the two has an estimated @xmath70kpc , much smaller than the impact parameter to the quasar sightline .",
    "the combined 2dfgrs and imacs data thus support the conclusion that this absorption line ( if genuine ) is not associated with a massive galaxy or group , though the possibility of an undiscovered faint nearby galaxy still remains ( see section  [ sec_data ] ) .",
    "interestingly , @xcite also estimate that about 1 in 4 ly@xmath2 absorption systems may occur in underdense regions .",
    "in a previous study @xcite , we examined the galaxy distributions around two candidate absorption systems detected in the mrk 421 x - ray spectrum , finding a large - scale filament coincident with the system at @xmath71 .",
    "the two nearest galaxies lie 360 and 390 projected kpc away at the same redshift , a large enough distance that we discounted the notion of a galactic origin for that absorption system .",
    "however , these galaxies are relatively bright , the nearer of the two @xmath72  corresponding to @xmath73 kpc . moreover , as these two galaxies are separated from each other by only 350 projected kpc and 8kms@xmath16 in radial velocity , they may well share a common group halo , in which case their virial radius would be even larger .",
    "thus , under the @xmath33 criterion adopted in this paper , the @xmath71 mrk 421 system would in fact be associated with the brighter of these galaxies ( or their group ) , not the more distant galaxy filament . in the context of the current study , where all three candidate absorption systems lie nominally within galaxy or group dark matter halos , a halo origin for the mrk 421 absorber may in fact be more globally consistent .",
    "interestingly , the nondetection of broad ly@xmath2 in this absorber by @xcite may be indicative of higher - metallicity gas , which would be preferentially found in a bound group halo rather than a sparse intergalactic filament .",
    "a fundamental puzzle in any igm absorption - line study , particularly one involving metal lines , is whether the systems being measured are connected to localized phenomena like galaxies ( or outflows from the same ) , or the more broadly distributed intergalactic medium .",
    "since metals are strictly produced in galaxies , _ all _ metal - line absorption systems must in some sense have their genesis in stellar systems .",
    "thus , the issue is really whether the observed gaseous systems are now _ bound _ to dark matter halos , or are instead the free - floating remnants of past outflows which have over time mixed with pristine intergalactic gas .",
    "high - redshift ly@xmath2 absorbers , even those which likely arise in the igm , are often found to be enriched ( @xcite , but see @xcite for a notable exception ) , so it stands to reason that some metal line systems could serve as signposts for the `` true '' igm",
    ".    however , one unifying theme among galaxy - absorber cross - correlation studies is that _",
    "strong _ absorption systems predominantly fall near galaxies .",
    "this appears to hold over a range of redshifts and ionic species , from damped ly@xmath2/lyman limit systems to ovi ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even ions like neviii , which arise primarily in @xmath74k collisionally - ionized plasma and were once thought to hold great promise for tracing the whim ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in fact appear to be located in or near galaxies as well @xcite due to its tenuous and highly - ionized nature , the intergalactic medium seems to make its presence known mostly ( or exclusively ) in low column density systems ( like ly@xmath2 forest lines ; @xmath75@xmath76 ) .    in this context",
    ", it would not be surprising if all currently known x - ray absorption line systems originate in bound systems .",
    "state - of - the - art x - ray spectrographs like  and _ xmm - newton _ , while revolutionary , are ultimately limited by the tyranny of poisson statistics and the faintness of background agn .",
    "even the most exquisite grating spectra achieve sensitivities no better than @xmath77@xmath76 , or an equivalent hydrogen column density of at least @xmath78@xmath76 ; typical deep spectra are several times less sensitive .",
    "thus , any significant x - ray line likely represents a relatively dense , enriched system .",
    "while a fraction of these regions may exist as filaments in intergalactic space , they are almost certainly ubiquitous in the form of circumgalactic and intragroup media .",
    "the galactic structures surrounding x - ray absorption systems , whether individual galaxies , groups , voids , or filaments , therefore play a key role in interpreting the nature of those systems .",
    "all told , four x - ray absorbers that were initially presented as evidence for the whim ( that is , the three from @xcite and @xcite , along with the higher - redshift mrk 421 absorber ) may instead be associated with bound dark matter halos ; two other systems ( @xmath79 toward mrk 421 ; @xcite , and the @xmath20 system of @xcite ) currently have no known galaxies or groups nearby .",
    "it can not currently determined whether these absorbers originate in the whim , very faint nearby galaxies , or are themselves spurious detections . however",
    ", the emerging picture  admittedly limited by small - number statistics  suggests that a significant fraction of x - ray absorption lines are hosted in bound systems .",
    "this remaining ambiguity illustrates the need for not just deep x - ray spectroscopy of multiple background quasars , but also complete galaxy surveys around the quasar sightlines to fully assess the nature of the surrounding structure .",
    "our magellan / imacs survey is ongoing ; an analysis of the full galaxy sample with the most recent  spectral data along multiple sightlines will be presented in a forthcoming paper .    unfortunately , even with a full sample of x - ray spectra and galaxy redshifts , systematic uncertainties in the /letg wavelength scale prevent us from kinematically associating absorbers with individual galaxies ; in fact no new instruments with this capability are currently on the horizon .",
    "however , observations and theory suggest that warm - hot absorbers likely occur in multiphase media @xcite",
    ". if this is the case , deep high - resolution uv spectroscopy of lower - ionization lines ( e.g.  civ , ovi , neviii , and broad ly@xmath2 ) may reveal extended warm gaseous phases associated with the same galaxies , thereby providing a circumstantial ( if not conclusive ) link between the galaxies and the x - ray absorbers .",
    "by combining wide - field survey data from 2df with new magellan multi - object galaxy spectroscopy , we have presented a detailed view of the galaxy and group halo distribution around three low - redshift x - ray absorption line systems toward h2356 - 309 .",
    "each of these systems appears to lie within the projected virial radius of at least one galaxy and/or group halo at the same redshift , though for the most distant system the overlap is marginal . though our sample is small , we conclude that a significant fraction of x - ray absorption systems may arise in bound structures , indicating that some of them may trace extended circumgalactic ( and/or intragroup ) media rather than the filamentary warm - hot igm .",
