    "the recent experimental confirmation of two- ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulators  @xcite ( tis ) , such as hgte/(hg , cd)te quantum wells  @xcite of certain width and compounds involving bismuth ,  @xcite respectively , has attracted considerable attention from both basic and applied research communities .",

    "@xcite thus , although tis have energy gap in the bulk , their topological order leads to quantized physical observables in the form of the number of gapless edge ( in 2d ) or surface ( in 3d ) states modulo two  tis have an odd number of edge ( surface ) states in contrast to trivial band insulators with even ( i.e. , typically zero ) number of such states .",

    "@xcite for example , fabrication of spin - field - effect transistor  @xcite ( spin - fet ) , where spin precession in the presence of so coupling is used to switch between on and off current state , requires to prevent entanglement of spin and orbital electronic degrees of freedom in wires with many conducting channels or different amounts of spin precession along different trajectories ,  @xcite both of which make it impossible to achieve the perfect off state of spin - fet .    ) under the fmr conditions induces via the proximity effect a time - dependent exchange field @xmath0 in the ti region underneath .",

    "the role of the central island with static ( in the rotating frame ) noncollinear magnetization , for which the incoming spins are not the eigenstates of the corresponding zeeman term , is to allow for transmission with spin precession or reflection accompanied by spin rotation ( for transport between @xmath112 and @xmath116 electrodes ) .",

    "however , this framework does not offer simple explanation of why pumped currents can become quantized .    figures  [ fig : localspin ] and  [ fig : localcharge ] also provide answer to the following question : what happens to current , which is confined to a narrow region of space along the samples edges within ti , as it exists from the ti region into the nm electrodes ?",
    "the local charge or spin fluxes remain confined to a narrow `` flux tube '' even within the nm electrodes which is refracted at the ti@xmath95 nm interface by an angle @xmath122 .",
    "this feature is explained by the fact that at the ti@xmath95 nm interface the helical edge state in the , e.g. , upper right corner changes direction ( to flow downward along the ti@xmath95 nm interface ) so that at this region of space at which current penetrates from ti into nm the quantum state carrying it has wavevector @xmath123 . by continuity of wavefunctions ,",

    "further increasing of the disorder strength diminishes pumped charge current much faster than the spin current .",
    "finally , our analysis shows that the second fm island with static magnetization covering the opposite edge of the device in the proposal of ref .   for quantized charge pump",
