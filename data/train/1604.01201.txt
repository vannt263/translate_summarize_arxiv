    "the promised speed - up will be critical for the feasibility of a simulation . in many realistic models ,",
    "the stiffness of the operators @xmath7 and @xmath5 is different which suggests to use splitting methods which separately propagate the two vector fields . if @xmath7 is a linear differential operator , effective schemes are known which solve the subproblem efficiently after appropriate space discretization . for the problems discussed in this paper ,",
    "a fourier pseudospectral space discretization is the most natural choice as this allows to propagate the linear part by exponentiation of a diagonal matrix .",
    "parabolic equations often induce high computational demand due to challenging solution dynamics , which suggests to employ adaptive time - stepping    in order to accommodate for local variations in the numerical error .",
    "however , this is not the only reason for using adaptivity .",
    "typically , the optimal step - size is not known a priori , and an adaptive procedure determines the appropriate value within a few steps , see for example section  [ subsec : compare_gs ] .",
    "moreover , adaptive time - stepping increases the reliability of a computation , see for instance  @xcite .    at the ( time-)semi - discrete level , @xmath8-stage exponential splitting methods for the integration of   use multiplicative combinations of the partial flows @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",

    "this is an important asset of our approach , however we will demonstrate in addition that adaptive choice of the time steps leads to a more efficient solution for problems where the variation in the solution is large .    for related work on adaptivity using a pair of lower order methods we refer to  @xcite .",
    "a rigorous error analysis of splitting methods for schrdinger equations has first been given for the second - order strang splitting scheme in  @xcite , which has later been extended to higher - order splittings in  @xcite .",

    "@xmath21 denotes the @xmath22-fold commutator . in our subsequent analysis",
    "we will make use of this error representation , where the main task will be to compute and estimate the commutators of the vector fields in an appropriate functional analytic setting in the space of periodic functions . to this end",

    "_ relies on the explicit knowledge of the leading error terms of methods of equal order .",
    "a collection of splitting coefficients covering also these three types of error estimators has been compiled at the webpage    ` http://www.asc.tuwien.ac.at/~winfried/splitting/ `    which we subsequently refer to as  @xcite .      in  @xcite , pairs of splitting schemes of orders",

    "since the number of compositions @xmath27 in the controller will be higher than the number of compositions @xmath28 in the integrator , we can select an optimal embedded integrator @xmath26 from a set of candidates obtained by flexible embedding , where the number of coinciding coefficients is not a priori fixed .",

    "the additional effort for computing the local error estimate is identical with the effort for the integrator @xmath26 but not higher as is the case for embedded pairs .",
    "this principle is limited to methods of odd order .",
    "in particular , in @xcite so - called palindromic schemes were constructed which turn out to have small error constants as compared to competing schemes .",
    "therefore , we include palindromic pairs in our investigations .      in the context of multi - step methods for odes ,",

    "this simple strategy incorporates safety factors to avoid an oscillating and unstable behavior .",
    "the chosen values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 are commensurable with the recommendations in  @xcite .",
    "the safety factors have not proven critical in our examples , the local changes in the stepsizes are usually smaller from step to step , see for example figure  [ fig : change_vdp ] .",
