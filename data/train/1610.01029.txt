    "in recent decades , an increasing number of supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions for quantum and classical models have been investigated ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in particular , super soliton solutions have been determined for susy extensions of various integrable systems of partial differential equations ( pdes ) , such as the susy sine - gordon equation @xcite , the susy korteweg  de vries equation @xcite , the susy schrdinger equations @xcite , the susy sawada ",
    "kotera equations @xcite and the susy hirota ",
    "satsuma equations @xcite .",
    "super soliton solutions were obtained using the connection between the super - darboux transformations and the super - bcklund transformations ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "supersymmetric versions of the equations of conformally parametrized surfaces provide rich classes of geometric objects @xcite .",
    "in fact , until very recently , the formulation of two distinct susy extensions of the gauss  weingarten and gauss  codazzi ( gc ) equations for conformally parametrized surfaces immersed in a grassmann superspace , one in terms of a bosonic superfield and the other in terms of a fermionic superfield , were the only known examples @xcite .    on the other hand , the subalgebras of lie point symmetries of the bosonic and fermionic susy gc equations were recently established in @xcite .",
    "the classification of the 1d subalgebras of each superalgebra into conjugacy classes has been performed .",
    "the symmetry reduction method was used to find invariants and reduced systems associated with the susy gc extensions @xcite .",
    "this approach allowed us to construct explicit solutions of these reduced susy systems , which correspond to different classes of surfaces immersed in a grassmann superspace .",
    "these extensive results make conformally parametrized surfaces a rather special and interesting object of study .",
    "this paper is concerned with the investigation of different geometric aspects of these surfaces obtained in connection with integrable systems .",
    "our main objective is to provide susy versions of immersion formulas for constructing large families of surfaces in lie superalgebras linked with integrable susy gc equations . in order to achieve this goal we investigate certain features of point and generalized symmetries of susy integrable systems .",
    "the construction of the susy versions of the fokas - gelfand ( fg ) formula for the immersion of 2d surfaces in lie superalgebras is presented in detail .",
    "we demonstrate that a susy generalization of the classical main result on the immersion of 2d surfaces in a lie algebra can be constructed .",
    "we show for these susy extensions that if there exists a common symmetry of the zero - curvature representation ( zcr ) of an integrable system and its linear spectral problem ( lsp ) then the fg immersion formula is applicable in its original form . for this purpose , we write the susy version formula for immersion functions of 2d surfaces in lie superalgebras in terms of vector fields and their prolongations rather than the notion of frchet derivatives @xcite . in the classical case ,",
    "the possibility of using a zcr and its lsp to represent a moving frame on integrable surfaces has yielded many new results concerning the intrinsic geometric properties of such surfaces ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the results obtained for the classical case were so promising that it seemed to be worthwhile to try to extend this method and check its effectiveness for the susy case .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to formulate a susy extension of the fg formula , which is obtained by applying a bosonic infinitesimal deformation to the potential matrices and the wavefunction of the lsp associated with the initial system in such a way that the deformed surface takes the form of a bosonic supermatrix .",
    "next , another susy extension is derived using a fermionic parameter deformation of the potential matrices and the wavefunction , which implies that deformed surfaces take the form of a fermionic supermatrix . for both extensions",
    ", we provide geometrical characterizations of the deformed surfaces using the super killing form as an inner product together with a susy version of the moving frame on the surface .",
    "these theoretical considerations are applied to the susy sine - gordon equation .",
    "surfaces associated with five different symmetries are investigated using the sym ",
    "tafel immersion formula , two gauge transformations and two lie point symmetries . for each surface",
    ", we provide a geometric characterization via the gaussian and mean curvatures based on the susy versions of the first and second fundamental forms .",
    "this is , in short , the aim of the paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , a brief exposition of the classical fg formula for the immersion of 2d surfaces in lie algebras is presented for integrable systems .",
    "section 3 contains an overview of the grassmann algebra formalism and introduces the notation used in this paper .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the construction of two susy versions of the fg formula for the immersion of 2d surfaces in lie superalgebras .",
    "more specifically , in section 4.1 , we formulate the bosonic immersion of super soliton surfaces , while section 4.2 describes the fermionic immersion of super soliton surfaces . in section 5 , surfaces associated with five different symmetries of the susy sine - gordon equation are constructed , namely the sym ",

    "the gaussian and mean curvatures were determined .",
