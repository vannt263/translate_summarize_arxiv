    "the velocity @xmath14 depends on several parameters . the drag force experienced by a helical particle as it propels in the fluid depends on the shape of its cross - section .",

    "[ directions ] we find that for all the pitch lengths considered and for the same applied external torque , the angular velocity of the helix is the highest of them all ( cf .",
    "s3 ) because it displaces the least fluid during rotation .",
    "also , the helix yields the greatest propulsion velocity when the pitch length is varied , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2].a because it has the smallest circular area of cross - section resulting in the lowest drag along the long axis .",

    "we have shown here that helical particles with a circular cross - section characterized by a minimum surface area result in optimal propulsion in terms of maximising the propulsion velocity .",
    "a circular cross - section of the flagella , often naturally encountered in many organisms , is thus optimized for propulsion . controlled propulsion in the presence of thermal fluctuations requires stability in the rotational motion ( _ i.e. _ , minimum wobbling ) which increases with the number of turns @xmath16 .",
