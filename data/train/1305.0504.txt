    "the simulation of strongly interacting quantum many - body systems is , in general , a computationally difficult task . even in the case of one - dimensional quantum systems with finite range interactions , where ground state properties have become readily accessible using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm @xcite , accessing the dynamics",
    "remains hard . while , the matrix product states ( mps ) @xcite that are at the core of dmrg manage to describe the ground states due to their weak entanglement @xcite , the entanglement increases in the real time evolution @xcite making the study of dynamics computationally challenging even for pure states .",
    "even harder is dynamics at finite temperatures .",
    "mps based methods operate on the level of wave functions .",
    "systems at thermal equilibrium , described by a _ mixture _ of quantum states , thus need to be purified by being described as a pure state in an enlarged system , consisting of the system and an auxiliary environment .",
    "the simulation is then performed on this purified system @xcite and by tracing over the degrees of freedom of the environment , the properties of the original system are obtained .",
    "this idea was first implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite for density matrices of thermal quantum systems and systems far from equilibrium .",
    "the same concept was used in the simulation of dynamical properties of thermal systems where the real time evolution was computed on the level of the purified system and the density operator for the original system was obtained by tracing over the environment @xcite .",
    "a disadvantage of these purification based approaches is that they require additional information on the environment , and especially on its dynamics . in general , these methods are accompanied by an exponential growth of computational resources with time and elaborate procedures are required to control the fast growth of entanglement .",
    "recent advances in the application to the xxz model have shown that a smart choice of the environmental dynamics can significantly extend the accessible simulation times @xcite .",
    "however , the question of the _ optimal _ environment and its dynamics is still open . even finding a good choice of the environmental dynamics requires deep knowledge of the system and is far from being straightforward .",
    "here we propose an alternative strategy , based on operator space concepts and matrix product states .",
    "similarly to the purification approach , we describe the density matrices as many - body states ; however , our states are not superpositions of quantum states but superpositions of operators @xcite . in the same way we also describe the observables and their dynamics , known as the time dependent dmrg in the heisenberg picture @xcite .",
    "an operator space approach was used in @xcite , however , still retaining the exponential growth of computational costs .",
    "the key feature of our approach is the _ combination _ of both concepts where the expectation value of an observable at a given time and temperature is calculated as a scalar product of two vectors in the operator space , one representing the density matrix and the other the real time evolution of an operator .",
    "this way , the simulation of density matrices and the real time evolution of operators are _ decoupled _ and can be performed independently such that only two simulations are sufficient to calculate a grid of expectation values at various intermediate ( inverse ) temperatures and times .    the computational costs to simulate the density matrices grow polynomially in time due to a low degree of correlation at thermal equilibrium @xcite , although such description has mostly been used to simulate systems far from the equilibrium @xcite .",
    "similarly , the simulation of local operators also exhibits polynomial growth of resources @xcite for integrable systems .",
    "this corresponds to a logarithmic growth of the operator space equivalent of the entanglement entropy ( osee ) @xcite , which is reminiscent of the situation in a pure - state local quantum quench @xcite .",
    "our method can therefore be used to simulate the real time evolution of local operators in integrable quantum systems in polynomial time .",
    "let us consider a quantum system of @xmath0 sites with a hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "the expectation value of an operator @xmath2 in a mixed state described by a density matrix @xmath3 , is given by @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "like the operator @xmath6 , the density matrix is also a linear map over @xmath1 and these maps form the _ operator space _",
    "algebra @xmath7 with an inner product @xmath8 .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath6 can thus be given as @xmath9 where the bracket notation @xmath10 is used when referring to @xmath11 and @xmath12 corresponds to the fully mixed state ( the identity ) .",
    "in thermal equilibrium for inverse temperature @xmath13 , the expectation values are given by using @xmath14 as the density matrix whereas the time evolution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : avea ] ) is obtained by replacing @xmath6 by the heisenberg operator @xmath15 .",
    "clearly , the simulations for @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be done independently .",
    "the density matrices @xmath16 are obtained by the imaginary time evolution , starting from the infinite temperature equilibrium state @xmath12 . by defining a map _ over _ the operator space , @xmath18 , which left - multiplies an operator by @xmath19 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath20 , the density matrix @xmath14 becomes @xmath21    similarly , the heisenberg evolution @xmath22 can be simulated by introducing a linear map defined as @xmath23   \\right)}}$ ] for @xmath24 .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the heisenberg evolution is hence transformed to the schrdinger evolution in the operator space @xmath25 both @xmath26 and @xmath27 have the same form and the same range of interactions as @xmath19 , if the basis for @xmath7 is local ( see [ app : a ] ) .",
    "let us now define a suitable basis for @xmath7 .",
    "while any basis could in principle be used , it is advantageous to choose a basis given by direct products of local basis operators @xmath28 } \\}$ ] pertaining to the site @xmath29 , as @xmath30 } \\otimes p_{\\nu_2}^{[2 ] } \\otimes        \\cdots \\otimes p_{\\nu_n}^{[n]}$ ] .",
    "these operators are chosen such that they form an orthonormal set .",
    "a suitable choice for @xmath28 } \\}$ ] depends on the type of simulation and a different choice can be made for the thermal  ( [ eq : rhobeta ] ) and the real time evolution  ( [ eq : at ] ) .",
    "for the former , the map @xmath26 , represented by @xmath31_{\\mu,\\nu } =      ( \\textrm{dim}\\mathcal{h})^{-1 } { \\rm tr } ( p_{\\mu}^\\dagger \\hat{\\chi }   p_{\\nu } ) $ ] , is real if @xmath32 are real which in turn allows us to simulate the thermal density matrices  ( [ eq : rhobeta ] ) with real arithmetics .    for the real time evolution  ( [ eq : at ] ) , where  @xmath27 is represented by a matrix @xmath33_{\\mu,\\nu } =    ( \\textrm{dim}\\mathcal{h})^{-1 } { \\rm tr } ( [ p_{\\mu}^\\dagger , p_{\\nu } ] h)$ ] , a different choice for @xmath34 is made to maintain the formulation in real arithmetics .",
    "if @xmath35 , then @xmath33_{\\mu,\\nu } = - [ \\hat{h}]_{\\nu,\\mu}$ ] and @xmath27 is represented by a hermitian skew - symmetric matrix .",
    "together with the imaginary unit in the exponent of  ( [ eq : at ] ) , the heisenberg evolution is generated by a real valued map .",
    "finally , due to different operator space bases used in the thermal and the heisenberg evolution , the calculation of expectation values must be preceded by a basis transformation , which in our case is a product operator and has no significant effects on the computational costs .    for reference we list a few typical operator space bases .",
    "in the case of spin-@xmath36 models , spinless fermions or hard core bosons the basis is given by the products of pauli matrices @xmath37 } = \\sigma_j^{\\mu_j}$ ] for @xmath38 .",
    "this basis is hermitian and thus suitable for the real time evolution whereas the thermal evolution is done using a real local basis @xmath39 .",
    "the local basis for spin-@xmath40 systems is provided by gell - mann matrices whereas for spin-@xmath41 it can be chosen as @xmath42 . in all cases ,",
    "the local basis is hermitian and its real representation can be found in a straightforward way .",
    "let us now focus on the mps ansatz for the operators . for simplicity we shall assume a spin-@xmath36 model although the results are readily generalized to any many - body quantum system with a local dimension @xmath43 .",

    "the evolutions  ( [ eq : rhobeta ] ) and  ( [ eq : at ] ) are simulated using the suzuki - trotter decomposition and local updates of the mps , known as the time dependent dmrg algorithm @xcite which is particularly efficient when @xmath19 contains at most nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "the thermal expectation value @xmath50 given by  ( [ eq : avea ] ) is obtained by combining the independent simulations  ( [ eq : rhobeta ] ) and  ( [ eq : at ] ) . using the same principles",
    ", we can simulate @xmath51 where @xmath17 and @xmath52 are mps , by constructing a matrix product operator @xmath53 .",
    "the result is given by @xmath54 which in the mps language corresponds to calculating an expectation value .",
    "similarly @xmath55 is obtained .",
    "the method proposed here can be used to simulate the real time evolution of a wide range of models at finite temperature , for local operators such as the spin projection at a given site , a local current , or correlations of local operators ( e.g. green s functions ) .",
    "we start by analyzing the complexity of both constituents of the method , the evolution of the density matrices and the time evolution of operators in the heisenberg picture .",
