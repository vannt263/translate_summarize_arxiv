    "small halos collapse at high redshift when the universe is very dense , so their central densities are correspondingly high .",
    "when these halos merge into larger hosts , their high densities allow them to resist the strong tidal forces that act to destroy them .",
    "it is therefore a clear , unique prediction of @xmath8cdm that galaxies are embedded in massive , extended dark matter halos teeming with self - bound substructure or `` subhalos '' .",
    "if the dark matter is in the form of a relic particle once in thermal equilibrium in the early universe , like the neutralino in susy , then substructures will be lit up by pair annihilations of these particles into standard model particles , whose subsequent decay results in gamma - ray emissions .",
    "the signal depends on unknown conjectured particle physics properties and poorly known astrophysical parameters .",
    "particle physics uncertainties include the type of particle ( axion , neutralino , kaluza - klein particle , etc . ) , its mass , and its pair annihilation cross - section . from the astrophysical side ,",
    "since the annihilation rate is proportional to density squared , the predicted flux depends sensitively on the clumpiness of the mass distribution .",
    "the detection of annihilation radiation from dm clumps is surely one of the most exciting discoveries that the upcoming _ gamma - ray large area space telescope _ ( glast ) could make . currently scheduled to be launched in may of 2008 , glast is nasa s successor to the compton gamma ray observatory , whose egret instrument conducted the first all - sky gamma - ray survey and discovered 271 sources , 170 of which remain unidentified @xcite .",
    "glast will carry two instruments , the glast burst monitor ( gbm ) , designed to detect flashes from gamma - ray bursts and solar flares , and the large area telescope ( lat ) , the main survey instrument .",

    "secondly , an uncertainty arises from the importance of dm substructure below the resolution limit of our simulation , due to its boosting effect on the brightness of individual subhalos , its contribution to a diffuse background from undetectable subhalos , and as individually detectable sources .",
    "lastly , the lack of a baryonic component in our simulation is another source of uncertainty .",
    "in addition to the effects baryonic physics might have on the dm distribution at the galactic center ( see section  [ sec : central_flux_corrections ] ) , one may worry that the abundance or detectability of nearby subhalos could be reduced by passages through the milky way s stellar disk .",
    "we can use the subhalo orbits from our simulations to constrain how large an effect such disk crossings would have .    for this estimate",
    "we have used orbits from the vl - i simulation @xcite , as we are still in the process of extracting them from the vl - ii dataset .",
    "we model the milky way s stellar disk as an exponential disk with scale radius @xmath151 kpc and scale height @xmath152 pc .",
    "only 8.2% of all vl - i subhalos ever entered a central disk region delimited by four scale lengths , i.e. @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "this fraction grows to 22% when only subhalos within 50 kpc of the halo center at @xmath155 are considered .",
    "only about one fifth of all disk crossing subhalos do so more than once .",
    "the median of @xmath156 , the velocity component perpendicular to the disk , is quite large , about @xmath157 .",
    "since the typical disk crossing times are thus a few myr , much less than the internal dynamical time of subhalos even within @xmath134 ( @xmath103 myr ) , we can apply the impulse approximation to determine how much subhalos will be heated by disk passages ( see  7.2 of * ? ? ?",
    "the change in the z - component of the velocity of a dm particle belonging to a disk crossing subhalo is given by @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the height of the particle above the subhalo s midplane and @xmath160 is the gravitational field of the disk at radius r , and is approximately equal to @xmath161 $ ] . here",
    "pc@xmath43 is the surface density of the disk in the solar neighborhood @xmath163 . setting @xmath164",
    ", we find @xmath165 \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\times \\left({\\frac}{|z|}{500 { \\rm pc}}\\right ) \\left({\\frac}{v_z}{400 { \\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}}}\\right)^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can understand how destructive such kicks will be to the subhalo by comparing @xmath166 to the local circular velocity at height @xmath167 .",
    "we find that for all disk crossings in vl - i the median of @xmath168 is 0.4 at @xmath169 , and only 25% have @xmath170 at @xmath134 .",
    "these numbers will be even smaller closer to the subhalo s center , since @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "we conclude that only about 5% of all subhalos within 50 kpc today might have experienced a significant reduction in central density , and hence in annihilation luminosity , from disk crossings .",
    "given the substantial uncertainties discussed above , one may wonder whether it is even sensible to consider dm annihilations from subhalos at all .",
    "we believe that the mere possibility of detecting dm annihilations with glast offers such an exciting opportunity to directly confirm the existence of a dm particle and to learn something about its properties , that it warrants theoretical investigations such as the present one .",
    "we conclude by summarizing our main findings :    * numerical simulations indicate that dm is far from smoothly distributed throughout the galactic halo .",
    "extremely high resolution simulations , such as the via lactea series , have shown that this clumpiness extends into individual subhalos , resulting in sub - substructure .",
    "since the annihilation rate is proportional to the dm density squared , such clumpiness leads to a boost by @xmath173 of the annihilation luminosity compared to a smooth density distribution .",
    "any determination of the gamma - ray brightness of individual subhalos must account for this boost factor . in the case of simulated subhalos",
    "only the portion of the sub - substructure hierarchy below the simulation s resolution limit should be included in the boost factor calculation .",
    "our analytical model of the boost factor , which assumes a powerlaw subhalo mass function of slope @xmath74 and low - mass cutoff @xmath75 , a resolved subhalo mass fraction of 10% , and a @xcite like concentration - mass relation , results in moderate boost factors of a few up to 10 for @xmath95 .",
    "lowering @xmath75 to @xmath174 raises @xmath175 by a factor of 2 . for @xmath176 @xmath175",
    "barely exceeds unity . *",
    "the portion of the substructure hierarchy below via lactea s resolution also contributes to a diffuse annihilation background from undetectable sources .",
    "the magnitude of this background depends on the spatial distribution of subhalos within the host halo in addition to the subhalo mass function parameters @xmath177 .",
    "we have extended the model developed by @xcite to allow for an anti - biased subhalo radial distribution and for higher subhalo concentrations closer to the host halo center .",
    "the resulting background tends to dominate the diffuse background from the smooth host halo at angles greater than @xmath178 , depending on the choice of @xmath177 . at high galactic latitudes",
    "this background can dominate the astrophysical backgrounds ( both galactic and extragalactic ) and should be accounted for when determining subhalo detectability . * by comparing the expected number of gamma - ray photons from an individual subhalo to the square root of the number of expected background photons , we can determine a detection significance @xmath73 for each subhalo .",
    "@xmath73 depends strongly on the mass @xmath12 and annihilation cross section @xmath13 of the dm particle as well as on the subhalo mass function parameters @xmath177 .",
    "we find that for @xmath149 gev and @xmath150 @xmath2 s@xmath3 , a few subhalos , even up to a few tens , exceed @xmath77 , and hence should be detectable with glast . in the most optimistic case we considered ( @xmath23 gev , @xmath179 @xmath2 s@xmath3 , @xmath84 , and @xmath180 ) almost 100 subhalos would be detectable , whereas increasing @xmath12 to 500 gev or lowering @xmath13 to @xmath20 @xmath2 s@xmath3 sharply reduces the expected number of sources , especially for low @xmath74 or high @xmath75 .",
    "* for the particular dm annihilation model that @xcite proposed to explain the wmap haze , an excess microwave emission around the galactic center , namely @xmath181 gev , @xmath182",
    "@xmath2 s@xmath3 , and a central host halo density cusp of slope -1.2 , we find that glast should be able to detect around 15 subhalos , for reasonable choices of @xmath177 . * th majority of all detectable subhalos are resolved with glast s expected angular resolution of 9 arcmin .",
    "the median number of pixels is 13 , and only 5% are detected in only one pixel .",
    "* for 9 out of the 11 observer locations we considered , the angular distribution of detectable subhalos is consistent with an isotropic distribution on the sky . *",
    "those subhalos that are detected with the highest significances ( @xmath183 ) tend to be the more massive ones , with a median @xmath5 of 24 km s@xmath3 .",
    "however , the @xmath5 distribution of detectable subhalos is flat , or slightly rising , towards lower @xmath5 , down to @xmath184 5 km s@xmath3 .",
    "* detectable subhalos typically lie between 10 and 100 kpc from the observer .",
    "the distance distribution is consistent with a log - normal distribution centered at 32 kpc and a width of @xmath111 . *",
    "it appears that the number of detectable subhalos has not yet converged in our simulations .",
    "higher resolution simulations would likely resolve smaller clumps , which are more abundant and more likely to be found near the observer .",
    "we estimate that we may be missing up to three quarters of all detectable subhalos .",
    "our results suggest that searching for galactic dm substructure should be an important part of the glast data analysis in the upcoming years .",
