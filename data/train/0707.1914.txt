    "accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysics .",
    "they form around newly born stars , in stellar binary systems and around supermassive black holes in the nuclei of galaxies .",
    "their efficiency at extracting gravitational energy is truly remarkable : in the case of a rotating black hole , the conversion efficiency can exceed a staggering 40% of the equivalent rest mass energy of the accreting matter .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the most luminous sources in the universe , namely quasars and gamma - ray bursts , must necessarily be powered by accretion onto a black hole .",
    "it is also widely accepted that high - energy astrophysical sources , such as x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , are also accretion - powered .",
    "the standard theory of astrophysical disk accretion was formulated over thirty years ago .",
    "@xcite since then , arguably the most important theoretical milestone has been the demonstration via numerical simulations that the removal of angular momentum required for accretion to proceed is mediated by magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence driven by the weak - field magnetorotational instability ( mri  see ref .   for a review ) .",
    "notwithstanding these groundbreaking developments , it still remains unclear precisely how energy can be channelled from the accretion flow to an external diffuse region where high - energy processes can operate .",
    "this outstanding issue is inextricably linked with the ubiquity of outflow phenomena associated with accretion disks .",
    "indeed , the formation and nature of relativistic jets remains one of the most formidable theoretical problems in this field .",
    "in this brief review , we highlight some recent theoretical progress made towards understanding vertical transport in accretion disks . @xcite a macroscopic",
    ", mean field approach is adopted for the mhd turbulence .",
    "this allows us to identify the dominant mechanisms responsible for angular momentum transport as well as the main contributions to the global energy budget of the system .",
    "we also demonstrate quantitatively how outflows , both poynting - flux - dominated and mass - flux - dominated , can modify the spectrum of disk emission substantially from that predicted by standard accretion disk theory .",
    "in the following , we present statistically - averaged equations in a cylindrical @xmath0 coordinate system for a fluid which is time - independent and axisymmetric in the mean ( @xmath1 , where the angle brackets denote ensemble - averaged quantities ) .",
    "we use newtonian physics throughout , with the gravitational potential @xmath2 .",
    "the fluid description is valid down to the innermost marginally stable orbit @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the gravitational radius of a black hole of mass @xmath5 .",
    "the mean - field conservation equations are integrated vertically over an arbitrary disk scaleheight , @xmath6 .",
    "quantities calculated at the disk surface ( @xmath7 ) are denoted by a @xmath8 superscript , @xmath9 , and we assume reflection symmetry about the disk midplane , so that @xmath10 .",
    "midplane values of variables are denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "we assume @xmath12 is much less than the radius ( the `` thin disk '' approximation ) , so that quantities of order @xmath13 and @xmath14 are neglected .",
    "we adopt a mass - weighted statistical averaging approach in which all variables are decomposed into mean and fluctuating parts , with intensive variables such as the velocity mass averaged according to @xmath15 while extensive variables , such as density , pressure and magnetic field , averaged the following way : @xmath16 note that intensive averages are denoted by a tilde , extensive averages are denoted by a bar and fluctuating components are denoted by a prime .",
    "the fluctuating velocity components are restricted to subsonic speeds because the mri is a weak - field instability which drives subsonic turbulence , with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the local sound speed and @xmath19 is the keplerian angular velocity .",
    "the only restriction we place on the mean fluid velocity components is that they satisfy @xmath20 and that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are independent of @xmath23 , simplifying the vertical integration .",
    "the combined magnetic and reynolds stresses are defined by @xmath24    in what follows , we summarize the salient equations for radial and vertical transport of mass , angular momentum and energy .",
    "a full derivation of these equations can be found in our earlier paper .",
    "@xcite for clarity , we have simplified the presentation of the relevant equations by omitting negligible correlation terms and by removing the notation for averaged extensive and intensive quantities . thus , averaged quantities are implicitly assumed .",
    "vertical integration of the mean - field continuity equation gives @xmath25 we now introduce the usual definitions for the surface mass density , @xmath26 and mass accretion rate , @xmath27 we also introduce an analogous mass outflow rate , @xmath28 associated with a mean vertical velocity @xmath29 at the disk surface , i.e. at the base of a disk wind .",
    "this is the total rate at which mass leaves the disk surface at radii exterior to @xmath30 .    in terms of the above definitions , the vertically integrated continuity equation , ( [ e : mass_int ] ) ,",
    "can be written as @xmath31 implying that @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total mass flux at the innermost stable orbit , @xmath34 .",

    "this is a generalized conservation equation for angular momentum in accretion disks .",
    "it can be equivalently expressed in terms of the flux of angular momentum , @xmath46 , as follows : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the angular momentum flux of the accreting matter , @xmath49 is the radial flux of angular momentum carried by the @xmath41 stresses and @xmath50 \\ ; { \\rm d}r$ ] is the vertical flux of angular momentum carried by outflowing matter and by the @xmath51 stresses .",
    "thus , both radial and vertical transport can contribute to the nett rate at which matter loses angular momentum and moves radially inwards . in other words , the mass accretion rate , @xmath52 , is determined by the nett rate at which angular momentum is transported radially outwards by mhd stresses acting over the disk height and vertically outwards by mhd stresses acting over the disk surface .",
    "the most powerful astrophysical sources are inferred to be accreting matter at very high rates .",
    "quasars , for instance , radiate energy at an astonishing rate , typically @xmath53 .",
    "much of this luminosity can be identified with thermal emission from an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole .",
    "if all the extracted gravitational binding energy of the accreting matter is converted into disk radiation , then the radiative efficiency is just equal to the accretion efficiency , @xmath54 , which is typically @xmath55% .",
    "thus , the rate at which matter needs to be accreting is @xmath56 .",
    "identifying the dominant mechanisms responsible for such high mass accretion rates has been a longstanding challenge confronting accretion disk theory .",
    "this problem is made even more severe if one considers in addition conversion of energy into non - radiative forms , such as relativistic jets , which can carry a total kinetic power at least as comparable to the radiative disk luminosity .",
    "it is interesting to compare the rate of angular momentum transport indicated by ( [ e : angmom_int ] ) with that predicted by standard accretion disk theory .",
    "@xcite in a standard disk , angular momentum is transported radially outwards only and the stresses responsible for this are parameterized by a dimensionless parameter @xmath57 such that @xmath58 with @xmath59 for stresses due to subsonic turbulence .",
    "in addition , the stresses are assumed to vanish at @xmath34 and @xmath52 is necessarily constant with @xmath30 ( since there is no vertical mass flux ) .",
    "thus , the angular momentum equation , ( [ e : angmom_int ] ) , reduces to @xmath60 = 2\\pi \\ , r^3 \\ ,",
    "\\alpha \\ , { c_{\\rm s}}\\ , h \\sigma \\ ,",
    "\\left| \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial r }   \\right| \\label{e : mdot_alpha}\\ ] ] there are two important limitations to the @xmath57-disk formalism .",
    "firstly , @xmath57 is treated as a global parameter , so that it remains constant at all radii ; there is no _ a priori _ reason why the radial distribution of turbulent stresses should be parametrized in this way . secondly , because the @xmath61disk model remains a phenomenological prescription , it is unclear whether the values of @xmath57 needed to account for the inferred accretion rates in different sources correspond to a physically plausible realization of the actual turbulent stresses in real accretion disks .",
    "numerical simulations may be uniquely capable of addressing these issues",
    ". simulations of accretion disks have demonstrated conclusively that turbulent mhd stresses can indeed remove angular momentum from matter , thus facilitating the accretion process ( see ref .   for a review )",
    ". however , 3d simulations of mri - generated mhd turbulence in accretion disks have so far been unable to produce high mass accretion rates .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , high accretion rates are recovered from 3d mhd simulations when a large - scale , poloidal mean magnetic field is explicitly included .",
    "@xcite these simulations and others @xcite , as well as semi - analytic models @xcite , show that at small radii , vertical transport of angular momentum by a large - scale magnetic torque is more efficient than radial transport by mhd turbulence .",
    "the numerical results indicate that mhd turbulence , whilst important for the microphysics of accretion disks , can not be solely responsible for the efficacy of angular momentum transport . indeed , as we show explicitly in eqn .",
    "( [ e : angmom_int ] ) , angular momentum can be removed vertically from an accretion disk by the mean fluid and magnetic fields ( i.e. nonzero @xmath62 and @xmath63 components at the disk surface ",
    "see also ref .  ) .",
    "we can make a direct comparison between the value of @xmath52 predicted by the standard model ( which considers only outward radial transport ) and that predicted by our model ( which includes outward vertical transport ) . using the @xmath57-disk formalism , the solution for @xmath52 generalizes to @xmath64 ^{-1}\\ ] ] which is larger than that predicted by the standard disk model , given by ( [ e : mdot_alpha ] ) , by a factor @xmath65 .",
    "that is , our model predicts that in regions where the vertical angular momentum flux exceeds the radial angular momentum flux , the local rate of mass accretion is larger than that predicted by standard accretion disk theory .",
    "we conclude here that it is large - scale , organized mhd stresses in the form of magnetic torques and mass outflows , rather than small - scale , turbulent mhd stresses , that lead to an enhanced _ overall _ rate of angular momentum transport ( and hence , high @xmath52 ) in astrophysical accretion disks .",
    "the fundamental relationship between angular momentum and mechanical energy ( @xmath66 ) then also implies that large - scale mhd effects must also be responsible for driving high - energy phenomena associated with accreting sources which must necessary originate outside the disk in a relativistic jet or magnetized atmosphere ( corona ) . in the following section , we examine the global energy budget of accretion disks in which angular momentum transport is prescribed by the generalized conservation equation ( [ e : angmom_int ] ) .",
    "we now consider energy conservation in mhd disk accretion .",
    "again , we refer the reader to our earlier paper ( ref .  ) for details of the derivations .",
    "accretion power is the rate at which gravitational binding energy is extracted from the accreting matter .",
    "this energy can be converted into mechanical ( e.g. kinetic , poynting flux ) and non - mechanical ( e.g. radiative ) forms .",
    "the rate at which this occurs is determined by keplerian shear in the bulk flow , @xmath67 , with @xmath68 .",
    "the rate per unit disk surface area at which energy is emitted in the form of electromagnetic radiation is determined by the internal energy equation .",
    "if there are negligible changes in the internal energy and enthalpy of the gas , then the disk radiative flux , @xmath69 , is approximately equal to the rate of stochastic viscous dissipation of the turbulent energy , which occurs on the smallest scales , either at the end of a turbulent cascade or via magnetic reconnection .",
    "if there is negligible transport of turbulent energy from the source region , then turbulent energy is locally dissipated at a rate equivalent to its production rate , @xmath70 ( see ref .   for a discussion on the relative importance of production , transport and dissipation of turbulent energy ) .",
    "the internal energy equation then implies @xmath71 vertically integrating over the disk height yields the following expression for the radiative flux emerging from the disk surface : @xmath72 note that in the @xmath57-disk formalism , defined by ( [ e : alpha ] ) , @xmath73 is directly proportional to @xmath57 . in a standard disk , @xmath57 is also directly proportional to @xmath52 ( c.f .",
    "[ e : mdot_alpha ] ) .",
    "that is , a standard @xmath57-disk model predicts that the disk surface brightness varies linearly with the mass accretion rate .",
    "our model , in contrast , predicts that disks can be accreting at a relatively high rate , but locally emit relatively little radiation if vertical mean - field transport is locally more efficient than radial turbulent transport .",
    "according to our model , the level of the turbulent mhd stresses @xmath74 available for internal dissipation is determined by the relative efficiency with which the extracted accretion energy is converted into non - radiative ( mechanical ) form . in other words , @xmath74 is specified by the angular momentum conservation relation ( [ e : angmom_int ] ) , which gives @xmath75 -      \\left ( \\frac{{r_{\\rm i}}}{r } \\right)^2 t_{r\\phi } ( { r_{\\rm i } } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac{1}{2\\pi r^2 } \\int_{{r_{\\rm i}}}^{r } \\left [ \\ ,    r^2 \\omega   \\frac{{\\rm d}{\\dot m_{\\rm a}}}{{\\rm d}r } - 4 \\pi r^2   \\langle t_{\\phi z}\\rangle^+ \\ ,   \\right ] \\",

    "thus , although we would not expect to directly see the modified disk spectrum in xrbs , our model can be indirectly tested by using the underlying ommcd spectrum as the source of seed photons that are upscattered in a disk corona and/or jet . by comparing the predicted and observed x - ray spectra ,",
    "we can improve our interpretation of the source characteristics and obtain tighter constraints on key physical parameters such as mass accretion rate .",
    "the above type of calculation has been performed by us for ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .",
    "@xcite these are exceptionally luminous xrbs found in external galaxies .",
    "they probably involve accretion onto a black hole more massive than those found in galactic xrbs .",
    "they provide an effective test for our modified disk model because some ulxs exhibit a low energy ( @xmath150 ) spectral component that can be interpreted as disk emission .",
    "however , because these sources emit virtually all of their radiative power as hard , power - law x - rays , which must necessarily be produced outside the disk , the accretion disk must be substantially modified and a standard disk model should not be used to fit the soft spectral component . indeed , we show @xcite that the ommcd spectrum can adequately fit the observed soft spectral component , implying a black hole mass @xmath151 .    a similar test can also be performed for quasars and other agn , which are powered by accretion onto a supermassive ( @xmath152 ) black hole .",
    "these sources exhibit a prominent optical - ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum feature known as the `` big blue bump '' .",
    "@xcite this energetically significant feature is generally interpreted as accretion disk emission .",
    "@xcite however , attempts at fitting accretion disk spectral models to the observed spectra have had mixed success ( see ref .   for a review ) . for agn",
    ", the disk spectrum will be most strongly modified by outflows at ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths ( see fig .  [ lnu ] ) .",
    "although there is less overlap between the modified disk and corona / jet x - ray emission than in the xrb case , the poor transmission of uv radiation through earth s atmosphere means that direct observations of the predicted ommcd spectrum in agn are not straightforward .",
    "nevertheless , spectral energy distributions have been compiled from optical observations of high - redshift quasars and from satellite uv observations with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse)_. interestingly , these observations have revealed a far - uv break in the spectral energy distributions of quasars ( see ref .   and references cited therein ) .",
    "specifically , the observed spectra decline dramatically at wavelengths shorter than @xmath153 ( i.e. frequencies above @xmath154 ) .",
    "this is difficult to explain with standard accretion disk models , which predict that the spectrum should continue to rise into the extreme uv ( see fig .",
    "[ lnu ] ) , but is consistent with the predictions our modified disk model ( see ref .  ) .",
    "the standard theory for astrophysical disk accretion has enjoyed remarkable success since its inception over 30 years ago . however , ongoing rapid advances in instrumental technology are placing increasingly tighter observational constraints on theoretical models that use a standard accretion disk .",
    "the ubiquity of energetic outflow phenomena in accreting astrophysical sources gives us two important clues to the underlying processes responsible for accretion : 1 .",
    "vertical transport of angular momentum can not be ignored and may indeed be the dominant mode of transport at small radii ; and 2 . the removal of accretion energy from the disk must result in a modified radial disk structure , particularly at small radii , and consequently , a disk spectrum that is dimmer and redder than a standard disk accreting at the same rate . we have presented a simple model that can be used to quantitatively calculate model spectra for disks modified by a magnetized jet and/or corona and by mass - loaded winds . these model spectra can be applied to a variety of different sources to improve our interpetation of the observations and more accurately determine key physical parameters such as mass accretion rate and black hole mass , as well as the partitioning of accretion power into radiative and non - radiative forms .",

    "<S> we briefly review recent developments in black hole accretion disk theory , placing new emphasis on the vital role played by magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) stresses in transporting angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent universality of accretion - related outflow phenomena is a strong indicator that vertical transport of angular momentum by large - scale mhd torques is important and may even dominate radial transport by small - scale mhd turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an enhanced overall rate of angular momentum transport and allows accretion of matter to proceed at an interesting rate . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we argue that when vertical transport is important , the radial structure of the accretion disk is modified and this affects the disk emission spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we present a simple model demonstrating that energetic , magnetically - driven outflows give rise to a disk spectrum that is dimmer and redder than a standard accretion disk accreting at the same rate . </S>",
