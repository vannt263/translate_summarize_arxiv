    "the separate conservation of the lepton number ( @xmath7 ) can be considered one of the central features of the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions .",
    "this result follows automatically from the asignment of quantum numbers to the fermions contained in the model .",
    "however , it is also known that lepton number could be violated in many of its extensions ; for instance by just providing neutrinos with a mass , either through dimension-5 operators or higgs triplets , can lead to violation of lepton number , which can manifest itself through several signatures .",
    "although the particle data book of 1998 @xcite does not report the presence of any new physics beyond the sm , the recent results presented by the super - kamiokande collaboration @xcite , showing evidence for neutrino oscillations , indicate that lepton number is not conserved in nature and thus the lepton sector of the sm requires some modification to account for the pattern of neutrino mixing that the data suggest .",
    "once the kamiokande data is confirmed as evidence for lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) , it is interesting to find other processes where such violation can be present .",
    "current experimental bounds on lfv transitions severely constraint most hypothetical sources of lepton flavour non - conservation @xcite .",
    "however , since the higgs boson is the only part of the sm that has not been detected @xcite , it is pertinent to ask if there could be a connection or mixing between the higgs sector and the mechanism responsible for the non - conservation of lepton number , and to find out wether some remmant effect could show up in higgs decays , which may be detectable at present or future colliders .    in this paper , we are interested in studying the decays of the higgs boson @xmath8 , as a possible signal of lfv",
    ". we shall work first in a model - independent approach , using the effective lagrangian extension of the sm .",
    "we shall focus on the dimension - six operators that induce lfv interactions of the z and higgs bosons .",
    "then , we also consider several specific models where lfv higgs decays may arise ; namely , the standard model with massive neutrinos , the general two - higgs doublet model ( thdm - iii ) , and the minimal susy extension of the sm ( mssm ) .",
    "the main result of this work is that the decays @xmath9 are generally permited to have b.r.s of order 0.1 , for both the effective lagrangian and thdm - iii cases , whereas the mode @xmath3 can reach at most a b.r . of order @xmath10 , only for some specific cases ; however both scenarios can be tested at future hadron colliders . on the other hand",
    ", we find that lfv higgs decays are highly suppressed for the sm with massive neutrinos and the mssm .",
    "the effective lagrangian approach has been used as a mean to describe the effects of new physics in a model - independent fashion .",
    "these effects are parametrized through effective operators of dimension higher than four @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian , up to dimension - six , is conveniently written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 , ( @xmath13 ) denote flavour indices , @xmath14 runs over the number of independent operators .",
    "the scale @xmath15 is associated with the onset of new physics .",
    "the coefficients @xmath16 are undetermined , and should in principle be calculable from the fundamental theory , but for phenomenologycal studies , it suffices to use the bounds obtained from present experimental data .",
    "the conservation of lepton number , which is automatic in the sm , is lost in general with the inclusion of higher - dimensional operators .",
    "for instance , the dimension-5 operator : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the lepton doublets and @xmath19 is the higgs doublet , can generate neutrino masses of majorana - type which violate lepton number by two units ; however , one can verify that this operator does not generate lfv interaction of the neutral higgs boson .",
    "most studies of lfv in the effective lagrangian context , have focused on establishing bounds on the scale @xmath15 , assuming for the coefficients the value @xmath20 .",
    "although it is tempting to associate a single scale ( = @xmath21 ) with all lfv operators , one should not use this as the only criteria to judge the relative importance of some operator .",
    "the possible values of the coefficient @xmath16 should also be taken into account to estimate the strenght of the corresponding operator .",
    "moreover , it could be the case that the new physics associated to the scale @xmath21 , could induce operators with very different coefficients @xmath16 .",
    "this is already exemplified in the sm , where the gim mechanism allows the fcnc decay @xmath22 to be observable , but it strongly suppresses the top decay @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "we are interested here in studying operators that can induce lfv interactions of the higgs boson . in general , some of these operators will also induce lfv vertices for the z - boson ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "present data on lfv transitions can be used to bound their coefficients , mainly from the decays @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 and @xmath29 denotes the light mesons ) and electron - muon conversion in nuclei .",
    "follwing ref .",
    "@xcite , one can specify whether some operator arises as a tree - level or as a loop - effect from the fundamental theory , and include for the last case the typical loop - factor @xmath30 to estimate its effect . at dimension - six",
    "there are a number of operators that can mix different lepton flavours , which can be classified according to the type of bosonic field that is involved ( gauge bosons and higgs ) , as follows .    1 .",
    "operators that generate lfv photon interactions .",
    "these operators appear in two types : @xmath31 and @xmath32 2 .   lfv four - fermion operators , @xmath33 3 .",
    "operators that only generate lfv interaction of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 @xmath37 4 .",
    "yukawa - type operators that only generate lfv interactions of the higgs , @xmath38    several comments regarding these operators are in order    * the operators ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) must be generated as a loop - effect in the fundamental theory . in this case",
    "the constraints obtained from @xmath2 transitions are quite strong , because they can induce lfv transitions of the photon , which mediates the decays @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "if one takes @xmath41 , these processes implay an strong bound on the scale associated to lfv ( @xmath42 tev )",
    ". however , the bounds associated with lfv transitions of the tau lepton are significantly smaller .",
    "* the set ( 4 ) is favored in composite models , and it also implays strong bounds on the scale @xmath21 for @xmath43 transitions . * the set of operators ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) provides a convenient framework to discuss lfv for the higgs sector , because one can use the bounds on the decays @xmath44 and @xmath45 to constrain their coefficients , and use them to predict the rates for the higgs decays @xmath46 .",
    "operators ( [ eq5 ] ) arise at tree - level , whereas ( [ eq6 ] ) arise as one - loop effects from the underlying theory .",
    "it is interesting to note that the operators ( [ eq5],[eq6],[eq7 ] ) , which generate the vertices @xmath47 and @xmath48 , do not induce the lfv photon vertex @xmath49 , which in fact just follows from @xmath50 gauge invariance .",
    "* operators ( 7 ) contribute to the fermion masses , and in order to derive the corresponding feynman rules in a consistent manner , one should include their contribution to the fermion mass matrices , then perform the diagonalization , and finally write down the interaction lagrangian in terms of mass - eigenstates .",
    "however , we find that the effect of the diagonalizaing matrices can be re - absorved into the ( unknown ) coefficients of the effective operators . , which appearently can induce lfv interactions for photon , z and higgs boson , can be reduced to the form of eq .",
    "( 7 ) . ]    since the operators ( 2 - 4 ) do not generate lfv higgs interactions , they willl not be discussed furthermore here .",
    "thus , our analysis will concentrate on the operators ( 5 - 7 ) .",
    "after ssb , one gets the lfv interactions of the z and the remmainig higgs boson ( h ) , which are described by the following lagrangians : @xmath51\\rbrace+h.c.,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath52   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^2}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}v^2}\\partial^{\\mu}h^0 [ \\epsilon^{ij}_{dl}(\\bar{l}_{li}\\partial_{\\mu}l_{rj})+ \\epsilon^{ij}_{dl}(\\partial_{\\mu}\\bar{l}_{li}l_{rj})]+h.c . ,",

    "( 8,9 ) , we have introduced the dimensionless quantities @xmath59 , to absorb the dependence on the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 into a single factor .",
    "we have also introduced explicitly the factor @xmath60 , for the coeffcients of the loop - induced operators ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "in fact , eq . ( [ eq8 ] ) describes the most general lfv interactions of a higgs boson that includes terms of dimensions four , five and six .",
    "parameters and thus can be neglected . ]    from the interactions contained in eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) , we can derive the expressions for the decay widths of the processes @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which will be used to constrain the parameters @xmath63 .",
    "we shall be working to first order in the parameters @xmath63 . on the other hand , although there are strong experimental bounds on the radiative decays @xmath64 , it happens that they receive contributions from the operators ( 5 - 7 ) only to second order in the parameters @xmath65 , thus the resulting constraints are rather weak and can be neglected in the present analysis .",
    "the results for the decay widths are : @xmath66,\\\\ \\gamma   ( l_i \\to l_j l^+_kl^-_k ) & = & \\frac{\\alpha^2(g^{k2}_v+g^{k2}_a)m_i } { 2048\\pi s_w^4c_w^4 } ( \\frac{m_i}{m_z})^4 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\lbrace \\frac{2}{3}[|\\epsilon^{ij}_{d\\phi}|^2+|\\epsilon^{(1)ij}_{d\\phi}+ \\epsilon^{(3)ij}_{d\\phi}|^2]+ \\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^4}\\frac{m_i^2}{5m_z^2}|\\epsilon^{ij}_{dl}+\\epsilon^{ij}_{dl}|^2   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^2}\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\frac{m_i}{m_z}im\\epsilon^{ij*}_{d\\phi } ( \\epsilon^{ij}_{dl}+\\epsilon^{ij}_{dl } ) \\rbrace , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 denote the vector and axial - vector couplings of lepton @xmath68 with the z boson ; @xmath69 denotes the fine structure constant , @xmath70 is the electro - weak ( ew ) mixing angle . in deriving these expressions ,",
    "we have neglected the lepton masses of the final states . for the decay @xmath71",
    ", we have included only the z - mediated contributions , because we are assuming that the diagonal higgs - fermion terms are of similar strength to the sm values , thus their contribution to the decay amplitude can be neglected .",
    "one can see inmediatly from the above expressions , that if all the operators are present , then the effects coming from the operator ( [ eq5 ] ) will be dominant , whereas the one coming from the loop - induced operator ( [ eq6 ] ) will be very suppressed .    then , we can also evaluate the width for the lfv higgs decays from the lagrangian ( [ eq8 ] ) , the resulting decay widths are given by :    @xmath72\\ ] ]    where    @xmath73 \\nonumber \\\\       & & -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{c^2_w } \\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^2 } ( \\frac{m_{h^0}}{m_z})^2    [ \\epsilon^{ij}_{dl}+\\epsilon^{ij}_{dl } ] \\\\ a^{ij}_r   & = & \\frac{s_w}{8c_w \\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha } }         [ \\frac{m_i}{m_z } \\epsilon^{ij}_{d\\phi }         -\\frac{m_j}{m_z}(\\epsilon^{(1)ij}_{d\\phi}+\\epsilon^{(3)ij}_{d\\phi } ) ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to present results for the branching ratios of the higgs into the lfv modes , we could choose many combinations for the @xmath74 parameters to satisfy the experimental bounds on lfv proceses .",
    "however , in order to simplify the analysis , we shall only consider three scenarios , that we think illustrate the possibilities to detect lfv through higgs decays , namely :    1 .",
    "`` democratic '' scenario , where we shall simply assume that all the parameters @xmath74 that appear in ( 10 - 11 ) are equal , i.e. @xmath75 , which is probably the most conservative case .",
    "the resulting bounds arising from the @xmath76 and @xmath71 , are shown in the first column of table 1 .",
    "we can see that the 3-body decay @xmath77 provides the strongest bound for @xmath2 transitions , whereas the z - decays gives slightly better bounds for tau transitions . to evaluate the b.r . of the higgs boson in this `` democratic '' scenario",
    "we also take @xmath78 ; the results are shown in fig . 1 , and we can see that the mode @xmath79 reaches a b.r . of order 0.1 that seems to be at the reach of tevatron for intermediate higgs masses ( 95 gev @xmath80 ) , whereas the decay @xmath81 can be at most of order @xmath4 .",
    "2 .   `` loop - dominated '' scenario , here we assume that only the loop - induced operators ( 6 ) contribute to lfv .",
    "in this case we find that present data does not imposse strong bounds on the coefficients of these operators , as it is shown in table 1 ( column 2 ) .",
    "however , even if we assume that the respective coefficients @xmath16 are of order 1 , it is found that the lfv higgs decays are more suppressed : the b.r .",
    "turns out to be of order @xmath10 .",
    "notice that in this case we can not distinguish among the different lfv modes .",
    "2 shows the values of the b.r . for the lfv modes assuming several values of the parameter @xmath82 , (= @xmath83",
    ", the first value corresponds to taking @xmath84 tev and @xmath85 ) .",
    "`` yukawa - dominated '' scenario , in this case we assume that the operator ( 7 ) is the only operator responsible for lfv higgs interactions .",
    "this scenario is very weakly constrained by low - energy bounds on lfv reactions , and in fact the resulting bounds are not significant .",
    "thus , we can evaluate the b.r .",
    "for the higgs lfv modes just as a function of the parameter @xmath86 .",
    "however , in order to introduce a criteria to discriminate among the different decay modes , we shall also include a factor that takes into account the breaking of the flavour symmetries that the operator ( 7 ) would respect in the absence of fermion masses .",
    "the flavour - dependent factor that we will use is similar to the one introduced in the general two - higgs doublet model to suppress fcnc , which will be discussed in the next section , namely we take : @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "the factor @xmath90 corresponds to the value of @xmath91 that is obtained with @xmath84 tev and @xmath92 .",
    "the results for the b.r .",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "3 . in this case",
    "the modes @xmath93 can also reach a b.r . of order 0.1 , which can be easily tested at the run - ii of tevatron for intermediate higgs masses .",
    "in this section we shall evaluate the lfv higgs decays for three specific models , namely for the sm with massive neutrinos , the thdm - iii and the mssm .",
    "* a ) lfv with massive neutrinos . * the sm with massive neutrinos provides the simplest example where lfv decays of the higgs boson appear .",
    "it is well known that the existence of massive neutrinos requires the inclusion of physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the low - energy effect of the physics responsible for neutrino masses is only the diagonal neutrino mass matrix ( @xmath94 ) and a leptonic mixing matrix ( @xmath95 ) , then the leading contributions of massive neutrinos to the 1-loop decay @xmath8 can be estimated by just evaluating the loop with two internal w s , which gives the finite result : @xmath96    @xmath97 denote the mass of the heavier lepton , w and higgs boson , respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath98 is given by : @xmath99 .",
    "present bounds on the mixing angles and the neutrino masses @xcite , can be satisfied with @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "thus , for @xmath101 gev the resulting b.r . for the mode",
    "@xmath102 is @xmath103 ; whereas the mode @xmath104 is expected to be much more suppressed .",
    "these rates are clearly beyond experimental reach .",
    "* b ) lfv in the general two - higgs doublet model .",
    "* we are also interested in studying the lfv higgs decays in the general two - higgs doublet extension of the sm ( thdm ) .",
    "this model has potential problems with fcnc , which were solved in its early versions ( the so - called models i and ii ) @xcite by requiring a discrete symmetry that restricted each fermion to couple at most to one higgs doublet .",
    "then , flavour changing neutral scalar interactions ( fcnsi ) are absent at the tree - level .",
    "later on , it was found that fcnsi could be suppressed at acceptable rates , with relatively light higgs bosons , by impossing a more realistic pattern on the yukawa matrices , which in principle can be associated with some family symmetry @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological predictions of this model ( called model iii in the literature @xcite ) have been studied to some extent . in this paper",
    "we shall use the higgs mass - eigenstate basis , which is more appropriate when one is interested in the detection of direct higgs signatures . in this basis the lfv interactions of the neutral higgs boson @xmath105 of model iii take the form : @xmath106 where @xmath69 denotes the mixing angle of the neutral higgs sector , and @xmath107 denotes the yukawa coupling of the second doublet . in order to satisfy the low energy data on fcnc ,",
    "it was proposed @xcite the following ansazt : @xmath108 where @xmath109 gev and the lepton mass factor gives the order of magnitude of the interaction .",
    "the coefficients @xmath110 are dimensionless parameters that can be constrained by comparing with present experimental bounds on fcnc and lfv transitions .",
    "the strongest bound for the parameters @xmath110 are obtained from muon anomalous magnetic moment @xcite , namely : @xmath111 , which involves only one coupling .",
    "other interesting bounds are : @xmath112 , which is obtained from the decay @xmath113 .",
    "we have also studied the decay @xmath77 , and find the result : @xmath114 , which is not as good as the one obtained from the muon anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "then , the corresponding decay width for @xmath115 is given by : @xmath116 the dominant decay mode of the higgs boson in the intermediate mass range is expected to be @xmath117 , which will be proportional to @xmath118 .    then , if we include the present bounds for @xmath110 , the resulting upper limit on the b.r .",
    "of the mode @xmath104 is of the order @xmath119 for @xmath120 , which does not seem to be at the reach of future experiments . on the other hand ,",
    "the mode @xmath102 is allowed to have a b.r . of order 0.1 , which seems at the reach of future colliders .",
    "in fact , the direct search for this mode at run - ii of tevatron could be used to improve the limits on the values of @xmath121 .",
    "results for @xmath120 ( 0.9 ) are shown in table 3 .",
    "* c ) the minimal susy sm ( mssm ) .",
    "* lfv interaction can also arise at 1-loop in the minimal susy standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "the mssm has become one the most preferred extension of the sm ; it predicts new signatures associated with the superpartners , although it reproduces the sm agreement with data .",
    "the most general lagrangian for the mssm has problems with fcnc . in the supergravity ( sugra )",
    "inspired models @xcite , potential fcnc problems are solved by assuming that the sfermion masses are degenerated and the cubic a - terms are proportional to the mass of the corresponding fermion . however , these conditions only hold at a heavy ( gut ) scale , and once these parameters are evolved down to the ew scale ( @xmath122 gev ) , some detectable fcnc effects may arise . to illustrate the rates that result in the mssm , we shall study the lfv effects that arise from the higgs - slepton vertex , using the results of @xcite , which finds the following expressions for the cubic a - terms in the susy @xmath123 model ,",

    "for @xmath3 is of the order @xmath130 , whereas for @xmath131 it can be of order @xmath132 , which does not seem to be at the reach of future colliders .",
    "we have studied the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) decays of higgs bosons @xmath8 , in several extensions of the sm .",
    "results for the effective lagrangian approach and the general two - higgs doublet model ( thdm - iii ) are presented in detail , whereas for the sm with massive neutrinos and the minimal susy - sm , some estimates are given . in the effective lagrangian case , it is found that for those operators whose coefficients can not be constrained by present data , the lfv higgs decays could have a branching ratio ( b.r . ) of order @xmath6 , which could be detected at hadron colliders ( tevatron or lhc ) .",
    "those cases when current bounds on lfv transition apply , induce strong bounds for @xmath2 transitions , and the resulting b.r . for the decay",
    "@xmath3 is of order @xmath4 ; however the bounds involving the tau are considerably weaker , and allow the mode @xmath133 to have a b.r . of the order @xmath6 .",
    "similar results are obtained for thdm - iii ; whereas the corresponding decays in the sm with massive neutrinos and the minimal susy - sm are much smaller , and beyond experimental reach .",
    "thus , we found that the lfv higgs decays @xmath133 can have large branching ratios , of order 0.1 in some cases .",
    "it is important to estimate weather such rates can be detected at future colliders . at the next run - ii of tevatron , it is possible to use the gluon - fusion mechanism to produce a single higgs boson ; assuming that the production cross - section is of similar strenght to the sm case , about 1.2 pb for @xmath101",
    "gev , it will allow to produce 12,000 higgs bosons with an integrated luminosity of 10 fb-1 .",
    "thus , for @xmath134 tevatron can produce 1200 events .",
    "since it has been shown possible to identify the hadronic decays of the tau lepton at tevatron @xcite , it seems factible to study the lfv higgs into @xmath135 by impossing a cut on the invariant - mass of the final state , which should allow to identify the signal . on the other hand , since the mode @xmath136 can reach at most a b.r .",
    "of order @xmath10 , then it will require a higher luminosity to be detected .",
    "for instance , if we have an integrated luminosity of @xmath137 , then we get 18 events , after including a detection efficiency of @xmath138 .",
    "although the rate will be low , the signal is so distinctive that using a cut on the invariant mass should allow to eliminate the sm backgrounds .    in summary",
    ", we have found several cases where the lfv higgs decays may be at the reach of the run ii of tevatron , which should be considered as a motivation , or starting point , to search for lfv higgs decays at present and future colliders .",
