    "graphene is a two - dimensional sheet of carbon atoms possessing unusual properties , which make it interesting for both fundamental physics and for numerous applications.@xcite the electronic excitations in pristine ( undoped ) graphene at frequencies below a few ev are massless and possess linear dispersion relation,@xcite where the speed of light is replaced by the fermi velocity ( which is the so - called dirac model of graphene ) . as a result , the interaction of the electromagnetic field with these excitations is described by relativistic quantum electrodynamics in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions .",
    "the existence of massless charged particles in graphene provides a unique opportunity to test some fundamental predictions of quantum field theory which are beyond the reach for usual elementary particles . among the effects which have become accessible",
    ", one could mention the klein paradox in the interaction of graphene with an electrostatic potential barrier@xcite and the creation of graphene quasiparticles from vacuum either by the schwinger mechanism in a static electric field@xcite or in a time - dependent field.@xcite    one physical phenomenon , where the presence of graphene leads to outstanding results , is the casimir effect .",
    "it is well known that the casimir force between closely spaced material boundaries is caused by the zero - point and thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field.@xcite if at least one of the boundary surfaces is formed by a graphene sheet , the casimir effect takes some new features .",
    "specifically , it was shown@xcite that for graphene the thermal correction to the casimir force becomes dominant at by an order of magnitude shorter separations than for bodies made of ordinary materials .",
    "although several formalisms have been used in the literature to study the casimir effect in different systems including graphene,@xcite the most straightforward approach , starting from the first principles of quantum electrodynamics , is based on the lifshitz theory of the casimir force@xcite and the polarization tensor of graphene in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions .",
    "this tensor was explicitly calculated in ref .   at zero temperature and in the framework of thermal quantum field theory in ref .   at any matsubara frequency .",
    "currently the polarization tensor is actively used for investigation of the casimir effect in graphene systems and many important results are obtained quite recently.@xcite    in this paper , we briefly describe the formalism of the polarization tensor and its applications to graphene . in sec .  2 we present the lifshitz formula for graphene as an infinitesimally thin plane sheet and consider various forms of the reflection coefficients .",
    "this allows one to make a link between different formalisms using the spatially nonlocal dielectric permittivities of graphene , electric polarizabilities , dynamic conductivities , and density - density correlation functions , on the one hand , and the polarization tensor , on the other hand .",
    "section  3 is devoted to different representations of the polarization tensor . here , main attention is given to the recently discovered representation@xcite allowing an analytic continuation to the entire plane of complex frequencies including the real frequency axis . in sec .",
    "4 , using this representation , the origin of the large thermal effect for graphene is discussed .",
    "the measurements of the gradient of the casimir force between a au - coated sphere and a graphene - coated substrate are considered in sec .",
    "it is shown that the measurement data are in a very good agreement with theory using the polarization tensor .",
    "section  6 is devoted to the possibility of observing the large thermal effect which is predicted for graphene systems at short separation distances .",
    "we argue that this effect can be observed by means of already existing experimental setup using the dynamic atomic force microscope ( afm ) . in sec .",
    "7 the reader will find our conclusions and discussion .",
    "according to sec .  1 , the most fundamental quantity describing the response of graphene on the electromagnetic field is the polarization tensor @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "this is a diagonal tensor , and only two of its components are independent .",
    "it is customary to use @xmath15 and @xmath16 as independent quantities .",
    "in fact , the polarization tensor is closely related to other physical characteristics of graphene . keeping in mind applications to the casimir effect",
    ", we present them at the imaginary matsubara frequencies .",
    "thus , the longitudinal ( along the surface ) and transverse electric susceptibilities ( polarizabilities ) of graphene @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the respective spatially nonlocal dielectric permittivities , are expressed as@xcite @xmath19 here , the following notation is introduced : @xmath20    in a similar way , the longitudinal and transverse density - density correlation functions of graphene are given by@xcite @xmath21 then , such important quantities as conductivities of graphene can be expressed in the form@xcite @xmath22    equations ( [ eq4 ] ) , ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) make a link between the formalism of the polarization tensor and other theoretical descriptions of graphene used in the literature .",
    "in fact each of the formalisms can be used to express the reflection coefficients of graphene @xmath12 . in so doing ,",
    "the polarization tensor found in the one - loop approximation turns out to be equivalent to the density - density correlation functions calculated in the random - phase approximation .",
    "it should be taken into account , however , that until very recently the full information about both longitudinal and transverse density - density correlation functions ( respectively , polarizabilities and conductivities ) of graphene at nonzero temperature was not available .",
    "full information was obtained first for the polarization tensor of graphene at the imaginary matsubara frequencies.@xcite    the reflection coefficients on the free - standing graphene sheet expressed in terms of the polarization tensor take the form@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is defined in eq .",

    "the generalization of the results of ref .   for the case of nonzero temperature was obtained in ref .   at all imaginary matsubara frequencies .",
    "it was extensively used in investigations of the casimir and casimir - polder forces in various systems.@xcite    the polarization tensor of graphene at nonzero temperature can be presented as a sum of the zero - temperature part and the thermal correction to it . for the 00-component and the quantity defined in eq .",

    "4 are obtained by using the approximate reflection coefficients given in eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "the total thermal correction is characterized by the difference of the upper and lowest lines in fig .",
    "it consists of the explicit thermal effect originating from the dependence of the polarization tensor on the temperature as a parameter ( the difference between the upper and intermediate lines ) and the implicit thermal effect originating from a summation over the temperature - dependent matsubara frequencies ( the difference between the intermediate and lowest lines ) .",
    "as is seen in fig .  4 , the thermal effect quickly increases with increasing separation . at @xmath66",
    "nm it contributes more than 80% of the casimir pressure . in so doing , the explicit thermal effect contributes more than the implicit one at the separations below 325 nm . at larger separations the implicit thermal effect dominates over the explicit one ( this separation region",
    "is not shown in the figure ) .",
    "thus , both contributions to the thermal correction in the casimir pressure between two graphene sheets are important and should be taken into account .",
    "the first experiment on measuring the gradient of the casimir force between a au - coated sphere and a graphene - coated substrate was performed@xcite by means of a dynamic atomic force microscope ( see refs .   and",
    "for a description of this measurement technique in application to the casimir interaction ) . the sphere radius was @xmath67 m , and the graphene sheet was deposited on a 300 nm thick sio@xmath68 film covering a b - doped si plate of @xmath69 m thickness.@xcite    the gradient of the casimir force in sphere - plate geometry can be calculated using the proximity force approximation as @xmath70 where the casimir free energy per unit area in the configuration of two parallel plates is defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . in this case",
    "the reflection coefficients @xmath71 refer to a au surface , whereas @xmath72 describe the reflection properties of graphene deposited on a two - layer substrate .",
    "both the reflectivity of au and of a two - layer substrate can be easily expressed in terms of the frequency - dependent dielectric permittivities of au , sio@xmath68 and si . there was a problem , however , how to calculate the combined reflection coefficient of a two - dimensional graphene sheet , deposited on a three - dimensional substrate , where graphene is described by the polarization tensor and substrate materials by the dielectric permittivity .",
    "this problem was solved in ref .   by the method of multiple reflections .",
    "the computations were performed using the polarization tensor with the nonzero mass gap parameter @xmath73ev taking into account that the graphene sheet could have the defects of structure and was deposited on a substrate .",
    "the computed gradients of the casimir force have been compared with the experimental data obtained in two series of measurements made for two graphene - coated plates over the separation region from 224 to 500 nm . a very good agreement between the measurement data and theory using the polarization tensor",
    "was demonstrated in the limit of experimental errors and theoretical uncertainties for both graphene samples .",
    "the experimental data was shown to be in complete disagreement with theoretical force gradients computed for the same substrate with no graphene coating.@xcite the same measurement data were compared@xcite with the alternative theoretical predictions obtained in the framework of the hydrodynamic model of graphene.@xcite it was shown@xcite that the hydrodynamic model is excluded by the measurement data at a 99% confidence level over the wide region of separations .",
    "thus , the experiment of ref .   can be considered as a confirmation of the dirac model of graphene .",
    "the experiment@xcite described in previous section has clearly demonstrated the influence of graphene coating on the casimir interaction . in ref .",
    "the problem was raised on whether or not the same experimental data can be used as an evidence for large thermal effect in the casimir interaction predicted for graphene at short separations.@xcite to solve this problem , the gradients of the casimir force @xmath74 in the experimental configuration were computed as described above at @xmath42k and at @xmath65k taking into account all theoretical uncertainties.@xcite it was shown that within the separation region from 224 to 300 nm the obtained theoretical bands do not overlap . the experimental data with their errors presented as crosses were shown to mostly belong to the theoretical band computed at @xmath42k ( a few @xmath75n / m larger force gradients than at @xmath65k ) .",
    "only several data crosses slightly touch the theoretical band at @xmath65k , which represents the force gradients with no thermal correction .",
    "this means that the already performed experiment@xcite was only one step away from the conclusive observation of large thermal effect in the casimir interaction between a au - coated sphere and a graphene - coated substrate .    to solve a question as to whether the thermal effect is observable at the cost of a minor modification of the existing laboratory setup ,",
    "the casimir pressure between two parallel plates made of different materials was calculated , where at least one of the plates was coated with graphene.@xcite note that due to eqs .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) and ( [ eq19 ] ) , calculations of the casimir pressure are equivalent to the calculations of the force gradients in the sphere - plate geometry , which is of an experimental interest .",
    "the computations of the casimir pressure were performed for the plates made of au , si , sapphire , mica and sio@xmath68 .",
    "it was shown@xcite that the influence of graphene coating ( and of the thermal effect)is the most pronounced for a plate material having the smallest static dielectric permittivity ( sio@xmath68 ) .",
    "it is a happy accident that in the experiment of ref .",
    "just the amorphous sio@xmath68 ( silica ) satisfying this condition has been used as a material of the film underlying graphene .",
    "then calculations of the thermal correction to the gradient of the casimir force between a au - coated sphere and a graphene - coated sio@xmath68 plate at the experimental separations have been performed .",
    "it was shown@xcite that within the separation region from 224 to 350 nm the thermal correction markedly ( up to a factor of five ) exceeds the total experimental error .",
    "this makes the thermal effect observable if the thickness of a sio@xmath68 film is sufficiently large ( computations were performed for a thick sio@xmath68 plate equivalent to a semispace ) .",
    "thus , the single point to be modified in the experiment of ref .",
    "is the thickness of a sio@xmath68 film which was equal to only 300 nm ( see sec .  5 ) .",
    "if it were increased up to at least @xmath76 m ( providing almost the same effect as a sio@xmath68 semispace ) the large thermal effect in the gradient of the casimir force originating from graphene would be observed with certainty .",
    "from the foregoing one can conclude that the lifshitz theory and the formalism of the polarization tensor in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional space - time provide fundamental field - theoretical description of the casimir interaction in layered systems containing graphene .",
    "the representation for the polarization tensor allowing the analytic continuation to the whole plane of complex frequencies can be also used to describe other physical phenomena , e.g. , the reflectivities of graphene and graphene - coated substrates.@xcite this representation also leads to simple asymptotic expressions for the reflection coefficients at all nonzero matsubara frequencies which result in nearly exact values for the casimir energy and pressure .",
    "the developed theory is found to be in a very good agreement with the measurement data of the first experiment on measuring the gradient of the casimir force between a au - coated sphere and a graphene - coated substrate . in the framework of this theory",
    "the large thermal effect predicted for graphene earlier was shown to consist of two equally important parts originating from the parametric temperature dependence of the polarization tensor and from a summation over the matsubara frequencies .",
    "it is shown that the thermal effect can be observed with already existing experimental setup if to make a minor modification of the used graphene sample .    in the future it is desirable to generalize the developed formalism for the case of nonzero chemical potential .",
    "this problem was recently solved,@xcite but only for the case of gapless graphene .",

    "<S> we present theoretical description of the casimir interaction in graphene systems which is based on the lifshitz theory of dispersion forces and the formalism of the polarization tensor in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional space - time . </S>",
    "<S> the representation for the polarization tensor of graphene allowing the analytic continuation to the whole plane of complex frequencies is given . </S>",
    "<S> this representation is used to obtain simple asymptotic expressions for the reflection coefficients at all matsubara frequencies and to investigate the origin of large thermal effect in the casimir force for graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the developed theory is shown to be in a good agreement with the experimental data on measuring the gradient of the casimir force between a au - coated sphere and a graphene - coated substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility to observe the thermal effect for graphene due to a minor modification of the already existing experimental setup is demonstrated . </S>"
