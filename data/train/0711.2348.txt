    "an investigation of superhigh energy cosmic rays in the 1950s - 1960s and 1970s - 1990s has led to the discovery of irregularities in the energy spectrum at the energy @xmath5  ev and @xmath6  ev  @xcite .",
    "the problem of origin of breaks in the energy spectrum requires reliable knowledge about the mass composition of primary cosmic rays ( pcr ) from high energies @xmath7  ev up to ultra - high energies @xmath8  ev .    the study of pcr mass composition at @xmath9  ev is possible only with the arrays registering extensive air showers ( eas ) and by indirect way only using the eas characteristics maximum sensitive to the mass composition . for these purposes , at the yakutsk complex array the characteristics of both longitudinal and radial development of eas are taken .",
    "the longitudinal development of showers is reconstructed measuring the eas cherenkov light , and the radial development measuring the structural functions of electron and muons with @xmath10  gev .    in this",
    "paper pcr mass composition data obtained at the yakutsk eas array in recent year are summarized .",
    "the estimation of pcr mass composition was determined by the formula : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the relative portion of nuclei to the mass number @xmath13 . in each case",
    "the experimental data were compared with calculations by the qgsjet model for the primary proton and iron nucleus in the framework of a superposition model : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a parameter characterizing the longitudinal or radial development of eas , for example , @xmath16   a maximum depth of a shower development , @xmath17   a portion of muons at the fixed distance from a core , @xmath18   a correlation between the total number of muon and electrons at sea level etc .",
    "the energy region of @xmath0  ev , where there are `` knee '' and `` ankle '' irregularities in the cr energy spectrum , has been considered specially .",

    "present results on the pcr mass composition of the yakutsk eas array .",
    "data were obtained in the framework of the qgsjet model and two - component mass composition ( proton - iron nucleus ) .",
    "a few characteristics corresponding to the radial and longitudinal development of eas  @xcite are used in this analysis . in each case , the value @xmath2 was determined by an interpolation method according to  ( [ eq2 ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] it follows that the mass composition changes reaching the heavier in the energy region of @xmath19  ev and then , beginning from @xmath20  ev it becomes lighter .",
    "the curves are calculations according to the anomalous diffusion model of cosmic ray propagation in the galaxy ( dashed line in fig .  [ fig01 ] )  @xcite and the two - source model ( solid line in fig .  [ fig02 ] )  @xcite .",
    "the calculations have been carried out separately for each of following groups of nuclei : p , he , cno , n - si , fe . the summary values of @xmath2 are shown in fig .",

    "data in the table  [ t01 ] point to the change of mass composition . in the energy region of @xmath21",
    "ev the mass composition is heavier than at @xmath22  ev .",
    "it contradicts the experimental data ( fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ) .",
    "the calculations  @xcite according to a scenario for the particle generation in the sources of two different types , assuming the analogous model for the cr propagation , showed the presence of a fine structure in the dependence of @xmath2 on energy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ) .",
    "there are also the sharp peaks in our experimental data . in this connection ,",
    "the investigation of the pcr mass composition with using a great numbers of eas characteristics and statistical data as possible is of particular interest .",
    "it should be noted that in the region after a `` knee '' the estimations of the cr mass composition obtained at the compact arrays agree well with each other . the same can not be said of the energy region of @xmath23  ev ( see fig .  [ fig02 ] ) , where hires data point to the faster enriching of the primary radiation by light nuclei and protons in comparison with the yakutsk array data , which point to the gradual change of the mass composition from heavier to light ( proton and he nuclei , on the whole ) at @xmath24  ev . in both cases , the data point to the existence of tendency to the `` protonization '' of pcrs at @xmath25  ev .",

    "a character of energy - dependence of @xmath2 ( see fig .  [ fig02 ] ) by the yakutsk array data points to the change of primary particle mass composition at the singular points of cr energy spectrum",
    ". the @xmath2 rises with energy after the `` knee '' , riching the maximum value @xmath26 in the energy interval of @xmath27  ev , and then it begins to decrease .",
    "such a behavior does not contradict a hypothesis for the propagation of cr by the anomalous diffusion laws in fractal interstellar medium ( lagutin et al , 2001 ) and according to which the mass composition of primary particles varies similar to experimental data . at @xmath28",
    "ev the value @xmath2 decreases gradually and at @xmath24  ev the mass composition is practically represented by he nuclei and protons .",
