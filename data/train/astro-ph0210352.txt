    "the  cosmic concordance \" cosmological model , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , has quickly become the standard as a result of new observations ( type i supernovae by @xcite and @xcite ; cosmic microwave background anisotropies by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) and its ability to reconcile long - standing problems ( for examples see @xcite ) .",
    "the only prominent partial holdout in this avalanche of evidence had been the distribution of qso lens image separations ( see @xcite ) , but even that discrepancy is now thought to be resolved @xcite .",
    "one less well known , but perhaps more striking discrepancy lies with the incidence of giant gravitational arcs in galaxy clusters .",
    "@xcite found that the the currently favored @xmath0cdm underpredicts the strong lensing incidence among a sample of x - ray selected clusters by an order of magnitude . because this discrepancy is one of the few pieces of observational evidence against what has become the accepted cosmological model , it warrants further examination on both the theoretical and observational fronts .",
    "we measure the incidence of lensing among clusters drawn from the las campanas distant cluster survey @xcite and compare it to other measurements and to the existing theoretical expectations .",
    "the potential use of the galaxy cluster mass function to probe the characteristics and evolution of the largest gravitationally bound structures , and therefore constrain the cosmological model , has been theoretically demonstrated over the past decade ( see for examples @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . unfortunately , there are various reasons why the study of clusters has yet to provide a wholly satisfying constraint .",
    "one of the most evident weaknesses had been the lack of large numbers of known clusters at higher ( @xmath4 ) redshifts .",
    "this weakness is being addressed with the many - fold growth in the number of known high redshift , massive clusters due in large part to a variety of both published ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and ongoing ( @xcite , @xcite ) ground - based , optical surveys .",
    "a second more pernicious difficulty involves the measurement of the cluster mass .",
    "the measurement is fraught with possible systematic errors and is observationally time - intensive .",
    "there are four ways to confirm that a cluster is massive : 1 ) compute the velocity dispersion using a large number ( @xmath5 ) of member galaxy redshifts ( for high - z clusters this requires several hours of observation per spectroscopic mask on 10m - class telescopes ; see @xcite ) , 2 ) measure the temperature of the intergalactic medium using x - ray observations ( this requires exposures of tens of ksec per cluster on x - ray satellite telescopes ; see @xcite ) , 3 ) construct a sunyaev - zeldovich decrement map ( this requires @xmath6 40 hours of on - source integration ; see @xcite ) or 4 ) measure the distortion of background galaxy images introduced by the cluster s gravitational potential ( weak lensing maps require several hours of imaging on 10-m class telescopes ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the demanding observational requirements explain why there are relatively few high - z clusters with measured masses and create a significant impediment to taking full advantage of the hundreds of potential massive high - z clusters presented in the new catalogs .",
    "a special case of method ( 4 ) is what is of interest here .",
    "strong lensing , where the cluster potential distorts the image of a background image sufficiently that it appears as an arc ( @xcite , @xcite ) , is a rare phenomenon that increases in likelihood , in part , as the cluster mass increases ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the observational advantages of using strong lensing include that a relatively modest investment of telescope time per cluster is necessary , that it highlights the clusters with the greatest relaxed mass , and that it is a relatively unambiguous phenomenon at a properly selected magnitude limit .",
    "theoretical studies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have found that the predicted numbers of strongly lensing clusters vary by orders of magnitude among popular cosmological models .",
    "the principal disadvantage of the strong lensing approach is that only a small fraction of clusters will produce gravitational arcs , so that even the results from large samples of clusters may suffer from small number statistics .",
    "nevertheless , the differences among various models are sufficiently large that certain models can be excluded by a small number of lensing clusters .",
    "in particular , @xcite found that @xmath0cdm models produce an order of magnitude too few giant arcs to match the observations available at that time .",
    "we describe a study that is analogous to that conducted by @xcite , except that our sample is drawn from an optical survey and concentrates on a more limited redshift range ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the cluster samples are entirely independent .",
    "the typical concerns regarding the viability and fidelity of optical cluster catalogs ( contamination and projection effects ) are less relevant here than in a measurement of the cluster mass function because any observed strong lensing confirms the cluster .",
    "as long as one realizes that this study provides a lower - limit on the lensing incidence , we avoid the concerns regarding optical cluster catalogs . in ",
    "2 we describe our sample and the observations . in  3 we present our newly discovered lensing clusters , calculate the incidence of lensing at these redshifts , compare that incidence to that found in other studies based on independent x - ray and optical catalogs , and compare our results to theoretical predictions .",
    "we summarize our findings in  4 .",
    "the target clusters are a subsample of the las campanas distant cluster survey ( lcdcs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the catalog resulting from that survey contains 1073 candidate clusters at estimated redshifts , @xmath8 , @xmath9 0.35 in a statistically complete sample . for each candidate we provide the coordinates , an estimated redshift , which is based on the luminosity of the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) , and a central surface brightness measurement , @xmath10 , which correlates broadly with standard mass estimators such as the x - ray temperature and luminosity , and velocity dispersion .",
    "extensive testing , in the original catalog paper @xcite , in work using our survey data to examine the evolution of the cluster galaxies and the bcg ( @xcite and @xcite ) , and in the preliminary stages @xcite of the eso distant cluster survey ( ediscs ) all confirm the contamination rates ( @xmath6 30% ) and redshift uncertainties ( @xmath11 for @xmath12% of the candidates ) derived in the survey paper .",
    "clusters in the lcdcs are detected as regions of excess surface brightness relative to the extragalactic background , by first removing all resolved stars and galaxies from the survey images and then convolving the data with a 10@xmath13 exponential smoothing kernel @xcite .",
    "positive surface brightness fluctuations are induced by light from fainter , undetected cluster galaxies and extended emission from the halo of the brightest cluster galaxy .",
    "the peak amplitude of the detected surface brightness , @xmath10 , effectively measures the integrated cluster light within a fixed , exponentially weighted aperture after removal of the brightest galaxies in the cluster .",
    "the value of @xmath10 corrected for galactic extinction is @xmath14 . because of the shallow nature of the exposures ( exposure times @xmath15 sec on a 1 m telescope ) , only a few ( @xmath16 ) cluster galaxies are typically detected and removed before smoothing ( including any resolved interlopers ) .",
    "@xmath10 is tied to the total cluster luminosity , with the caveats that more galaxies will be removed prior to smoothing in nearer systems , that the bcg may contribute significantly , and that the concentration of the cluster will affect @xmath10 .",
    "these distance - dependent effects must be empirically calibrated and that calibration is currently somewhat uncertain due to the small number of x - ray clusters at @xmath17 that we have been able to observe with the same instrumental configuration . for more details on this calibration",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "using @xmath14 , we select the clusters that are likely to be the most massive systems in the catalog at @xmath18 . because of the possible exclusion of massive clusters due to the scatter between @xmath14 and mass , the measured incidence of lensing from this sample ,",
    "if quantified as the number of lenses per unit volume ( or per steradian ) , will be a lower limit on the true incidence .",
    "the two other potential problems with the lcdcs selection , the possible presence of `` false '' clusters in the sample due to contamination and the possible inclusion of less massive clusters because of scatter in @xmath19mass relation , will make our search less efficient but will not bias the lensing incidence if we express the quantity in terms of lenses per steradian .",
    "however , potential unknown biases , for example if the success of our method in identifying a cluster depends on a cluster property that also affects the likelihood of cluster lensing , such as the concentration of the mass profile , then some possible choices for the measure of the lensing incidence , such as the _ fraction _ of lensing clusters would be artificially inflated , while others , such as the number of lenses per steradian would be unchanged .",
    "care must be taken in defining a quantification of incidence that is consistently a lower limit .",
    "we shall quote lensing incidence as a function of area of sky .    from the lcdcs catalog , we select candidate clusters with @xmath20 and @xmath21 cts s@xmath22 sq .",
    "arcsec@xmath22 , which corresponds to a velocity dispersion , @xmath23 , greater than 390 km s@xmath22 at @xmath24 , 765 km s@xmath22 at @xmath25 , and 1040 km s@xmath22 at @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "these criteria produce a list of 125 candidates that we then classify visually .",
    "some high surface brightness candidates are obvious low surface brightness galaxies or tidally interacting pairs and can be rejected immediately ( of the 125 candidates , only six were identified to be such from the original survey data ) . of the remaining 119 candidates , we select 66 as being the most promising , with the highest priority for observation .",
    "independently selected , there is a sample of 30 lcdcs candidates that are being observed as part of the eso distant cluster survey , or ediscs ( 19 of which fall within our selection criteria ) .",
    "we did not re - observe the 16 of these that fall within our high - priority list , nor the three that fall within our low - priority list .",
    "we were able to observe 44 candidate clusters ( 40 from the high priority list and four from the low priority list ) with the baade 6.5 m telescope on las campanas using the magellan instant camera ( magic ) during 9 - 12 mar 2002 .",
    "the camera s detector is a site 2k by 2k device with a pixel scale of 0.069 arcsec pixel@xmath22 ( field - of - view is 2.36@xmath27 ) .",
    "we observed in the sdss @xmath28 filter @xcite , with complementary @xmath29 observations for four clusters that showed interesting features in the initial @xmath28 frames .",
    "the exposure times are either 1800 or 2400 sec total , split between 3 frames ( the total exposure times for each cluster are given in table 1 ) .",
    "the seeing was excellent for the four night observing run .",
    "the effective seeing",
    "( after registering the images and combining ) is typically 0.5 to 0.6 arcsec , and is given for each cluster in table 1 .",
    "the data reduction is only slightly more complicated than usual because the camera uses a four amplifier read - out mode to reduce the readout time .",
    "therefore , bias and flatfielding is done differently for each quadrant .",
    "we applied the standard , public magic reduction pipeline to do the first order corrections and corrected for cosmic rays using the cosmicrays task in iraf .",
    "we then use the source extractor ( sextractor ) algorithm @xcite to produce a background sky image ( objects removed ) .",
    "we remove the spatially - variable background by subtracting this image from the original image .",
    "images are then registered and combined using imalign and imcombine tasks in iraf .",
    "we run sextractor on the final combined images to produce a catalog of objects in each target field and objects with stellarity index @xmath30 0.9 are considered to be galaxies .",
    "our detection parameters are set conservatively to require a minimum of 10 pixels , each above a 1@xmath23 deviation above the global sky , for an object detection .",
    "we interactively define polygon apertures in the @xmath28 band to measure the magnitudes and colors of the lensed galaxies .",
    "photometric calibration was done using both the sdss calibration @xcite and landolt ( 1992 ) standards to place the photometry on both systems .",
    "the redshift and surface brightness , @xmath14 , distributions of the entire sample of 125 candidates and the subsample of observed clusters ( including the ediscs clusters ) are shown in figure [ fig : sampleprop ] .",
    "the only qualitative difference between the low and high priority clusters is that the high priority clusters are slightly more weighted toward lower redshifts .",
    "this difference is the result of lower - redshift candidates appearing more secure in the original survey data , and hence assigned a higher priority .",
    "the ediscs observations will help fill in the high redshift tail of the range , while most of the clusters observed here lie between @xmath31 .",
    "the right panels of the figure illustrate the difficulty in defining a mass - limited sample .",
    "the steep rise in the number of clusters toward smaller masses means that a small systematic error could easily change the sample size by a factor of two and that random errors will generate significant contamination of the sample by lower - mass clusters .",
    "the final desired quantity , the incidence of giant arcs , can be made independent of the uncertainty in the mass measurement by being sufficiently conservative in the mass cut used to define the imaging subsample . because only high - mass clusters produce strong arcs ( see @xcite ) , a sufficiently low mass cut",
    "will ensure that all strongly - lensing clusters are in the subsample .",
    "the disadvantage of such an approach is that the number of clusters to observe is correspondingly larger .",
    "the advantage of a catalog with more precise mass measurements , such as x - ray luminosity or temperature , is primarily in the efficiency with which one can initially identify the candidate lensing clusters , but all studies should find the lensing clusters .    to examine the effects of our adopted mass cut , we plot @xmath14 vs. @xmath8 for our sample and two curves that illustrate where our calibration of the @xmath32 relationship places the two @xmath33 limits from previous studies cosmology to the open cosmology ( @xmath34 ) used by @xcite in determining the various relationships used here . for this reason ,",
    "the numerical values are generally @xmath6 1.2 times the published values . ] in figure [ fig : masscut ] .",
    "the lower curve corresponds to @xmath35 ergs s@xmath22 , the limit below which previous studies found no strongly lensing clusters @xcite .",
    "the upper curve corresponds to @xmath36 ergs s@xmath22 , a cluster luminosity at which previous studies found that over 50% of clusters act as strong lenses ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our sample would include all of the most - likely lcdcs lensing clusters ( @xmath37 ergs s@xmath22 ) for @xmath38 , _ if there was no scatter in our @xmath39 calibration_. we include clusters below the @xmath40 ergs s@xmath22 line at low @xmath41 because our estimation of @xmath33 using @xmath14 has roughly a factor of two scatter @xcite . at @xmath42",
    "the scatter in the relationship implies that we are potentially missing some strongly - lensing clusters in our survey .",
    "an important aspect of the calibration that is yet not well - measured is the redshift evolution . in making the figure",
    "we adopt a @xmath43 evolution in the optical surface brightness , even though a fit to limited data available suggests a steeper slope @xcite .",
    "adopting the latter behavior would make the curves decline more steeply than shown in the figure and would suggest that we are even less complete in our sample of high - mass clusters at high - redshift than illustrated in figure [ fig : masscut ] .",
    "we are currently unable to be sufficiently conservative in our inclusion of all possible lensing clusters at these redshifts because of the limited number of candidates that we can follow - up . as such",
    ", this adds another reason why we consider our result to be a lower limit on the incidence of lensing at these redshifts .",
    "we visually examine each of the cluster images . to match previous work we are attempting primarily to identify arcs that extend at least @xmath6 10@xmath13 and have @xmath44 .",
    "these criteria place these images well above our detection thresholds . in the last column of table 1",
    ", we present comments regarding the candidate cluster ( ` marginal ' reflects the status of the cluster candidate , not of any potential arc - like feature ) .",
    "we identify three clusters that exhibit features that appear to be gravitationally lensed galaxies ( lcdcs 280 , 486 , and 954 , see figure 3 - 5 ) . for these three clusters we also identify several additional ( sometimes questionable ) features that may be lensed images .",
    "however , we do not identify similar low - quality features in other cluster fields because of their uncertainty as lensed images .",
    "a summary of their magnitudes and colors is presented in table 2 .",
    "the magnitudes of the  lensed \" images ranges from 20.07 to 24.25 in @xmath45 , while the faintest detected objects in the frame are typically at least two magnitudes fainter .",
    "the galaxy count histograms typically peak at a magnitude of between 23 and 24 , and only thereafter exhibit serious incompleteness .",
    "no cluster has a histogram that peaks brighter than @xmath46 , which is 2 magnitudes fainter than our criteria for identifying the principal lensed image in a cluster .",
    "this is the least convincing case of lensing among the three clusters in which we have found  lens - like \" images .",
    "both lens features 1 and 2 consist of four peaks , each around a different apparent mass center in the cluster .",
    "the luminous galaxy near lens feature 1 is a typical , extended brightest cluster galaxy .",
    "lens features 3,4,5 , and 6 are all quite marginal cases of lensing , but they appear curved with a center of curvature near the bcg .",
    "spectroscopy of lensed features 1 and 2 is possible with a large telescope ( sources are brighter than @xmath47 and the irregular structure may be indicative of emission line regions ) .    assuming that the images are lensed , we estimate the mass producing the lensing by adopting the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) potential , measuring the distance from the lensed image to the center of curvature ( @xmath48 ) , and making an assumption that the source distance is twice that of the lens . as such ,",
    "the velocity dispersion of the sis potential is given by @xmath49 .",
    "defining the center of curvature is somewhat ambiguous in these cases , but we explore two possibilities : 1 ) we visually fit a circle through the suspected lensed images ( @xmath50 ) , and 2 ) we take the center to be coincident on the nearby dominant galaxy ( @xmath51 ) . in the former case , we calculate that @xmath52 km s@xmath22 , and in the latter that @xmath53 km s@xmath22 .",
    "the latter case suggests that if these are lensed images , we may be seeing group / galaxy lensing rather than cluster lensing .",
    "the former is a plausible cluster lens velocity dispersion , but is significantly larger than the dispersion calculated from @xmath14 , 520 km s@xmath22 , using the relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath23 from @xcite .    given the various difficulties in convincingly identifying these images as lensed images and our intent to maintain our measurement as a lower limit , _ we will not count this object as a lensing cluster_. further observations are necessary to confirm the lensed nature of these images .",
    "this cluster contains the brightest of the arc features found in this study ( and the brightest of any of the arcs listed in the luppino et al .",
    "( 1999 ) compendium ; their table 2 ) .",
    "we measure that the arc has a length , @xmath54 , of 13.7@xmath13 a length - to - width ratio , @xmath55 , of 10.9 ( 12.5 if the width has the effect of seeing removed by simple quadrature ) , and an average surface brightness of @xmath56 mag sq .",
    "the one potentially suspicious aspect of this arc is the sharp bend in the middle .",
    "a possible interpretation is that we are seeing a superposition of an arc ( or two ) and an unlensed galaxy .",
    "however , the @xmath57 color is highly uniform along the entire length ( the color of the entire arc matches that of the primarily horizontal portion , 1a , and that of the primarily vertical portion , 1b , to 0.02 mag ) .",
    "the rather unusual arc morphology implies a challenge to the modeling of this system , but the length , the degree of curvature , and uniform colors suggest that this is indeed a lensed image .",
    "applying the same simple mass model as above ( for a measured @xmath58 , we estimate the velocity dispersion of the corresponding sis model to be 790 km s@xmath22 . from @xmath14",
    "we estimate that @xmath59 km s@xmath22 .",
    "the agreement between the two @xmath23 estimates further supports the lensing interpretation of this image .",
    "this is the most  classic \" lens of the three systems , with some other lensed features also visible in the image . in particular",
    ", lens feature 2 is a potential radial arc .",
    "the principal arc has @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( 11.7 when the width is corrected for the effect of seeing ) , and an average surface brightness of @xmath62 mag / sq .",
    "this is the most massive ( as measured by @xmath14 corrected for redshift ) cluster in our sample for @xmath63 and shows the most dramatic lensing .",
    "such berclusters are exceedingly rare . given the effective area of the lcdcs ( 69 sq .",
    "deg ; @xcite ) and the discovery of one such system at these redshifts , we expect only about 600 similar clusters in the universe at @xmath64 .",
    "there is a similar known cluster rx j1347.5@xmath651145 in the lcdcs ( lcdcs 829 ) at slightly lower redshifts , 0.45 , ( which also produces gravitational arcs ; @xcite ) and has a measured bolometric @xmath33 somewhere between @xmath66 and @xmath67ergs s@xmath22 ; @xcite , @xcite ) . for a local comparison ,",
    "the coma cluster has @xmath68 ergs s@xmath22 @xcite . for a distant comparison , ms1054.4@xmath650321 , which is the best - studied x - ray luminous massive cluster at @xmath69 has @xmath70 @xcite , with a well - measured weak lensing signal @xcite but no strong lensing .",
    "lcdcs 829 is known to be more x - ray luminous than these two well - known clusters , and lcdcs 954 is expected to be more luminous based on its value of @xmath14 .",
    "again , we estimate the mass of the system by fitting an sis model for a measured @xmath71 . we calculate that @xmath72 km s@xmath22 .",
    "the estimated @xmath23 derived from @xmath14 is 1670 km s@xmath22 .",
    "there is some discrepancy in these estimates , but both suggest that this is a very massive cluster .",
    "although we have repeatedly noted that this study will provide a lower limit on the lensing incidence , a measurement that is far below the true incidence may provide little constraint on cosmological models .",
    "there are two primary reasons why our measurement could be a gross underrepresentation of the true value .",
    "first , the lcdcs could be severely incomplete in the most massive clusters .",
    "second , even if the lcdcs is complete , our subsample could be incomplete if our conversion between @xmath14 and mass is faulty .",
    "we argue against both of these possibilities below and then present a comparison of our measurement of the lensing incidence to observational and theoretical studies .      to determine whether the lcdcs is missing a significant fraction of potential lensing clusters , we compare the number densities of massive clusters in the lcdcs and in the _",
    "einstein medium sensitivity survey _ ( emss ) .",
    "we restrict our analysis to 0.4@xmath30@xmath41@xmath300.6 , where the @xmath73 relation is best determined ( and does not involve the highly uncertain redshift correction ) , and to @xmath74 ergs s@xmath22 @xmath75 , where the emss catalog is less incomplete .    within the effective area of the primary , statistical lcdcs catalog ( 69 sq .",
    "degrees ) , we detect 9 cluster candidates at 0.4@xmath30@xmath41@xmath760.6 with surface brightnesses that imply @xmath33@xmath9@xmath77 ergs s@xmath22 .",
    "this result yields a raw angular density of ( 13@xmath78 clusters per square degree ( to minimize dependence on cosmological models we calculate and compare angular densities ) .",
    "the first quoted uncertainty reflects poisson counting ; the second reflects the systematic uncertainty from the conversion of @xmath14 to @xmath33 ( a 1@xmath65@xmath23 variation in this relation results in a net change in sample size of @xmath794 clusters ) .",
    "there are several further steps in converting this raw density to a true density .    because the number of clusters rises rapidly as mass decreases , significant scatter in @xmath14 or @xmath33 , which is certainly present in the lcdcs ,",
    "will artificially boost the number of clusters found above an imposed mass or @xmath33 threshold .",
    "redshift uncertainty and contamination in the lcdcs catalog also act to amplify the observed number of clusters . to assess the effect of scatter in the @xmath33 conversion on the number density , we approximate the underlying cluster mass function with a press - schechter distribution @xcite . this distribution",
    "is then multiplied by a transfer function to reproduce the effect of imposing a fixed mass limit . for data with a gaussian uncertainty in mass ,",
    "this yields @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the number of clusters of a given mass that are included in the sample , @xmath82 is the initial press - schechter mass function , @xmath83 is the uncertainty in @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is the mass limit of the survey imposed by the observer . to connect virial mass to @xmath33",
    ", we use the @xmath86 relation of @xcite in conjunction with the equation @xmath87^{-1/2 } h_{50}^{-1 } m_{\\odot},\\ ] ] which relates virial mass to x - ray temperature for a spherically symmetric , isothermal plasma in virial equilibrium ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath88 is defined as in @xcite , and we set @xmath89=1 . for the lcdcs , the uncertainty is consistent with arising primarily from observational uncertainty ( i.e. @xmath90 is constant ) , so @xmath91 for @xmath92 counts s@xmath22 arcsec@xmath93 ( see @xcite for the origin of this value ) .",
    "the emss has the same qualitative problem , but the uncertainty in @xmath33 is dominated by intrinsic scatter ( i.e. the fractional uncertainty @xmath94 is roughly constant ) , so @xmath95 for @xmath96=0.2 .",
    "for an imposed threshold of @xmath97 ergs s@xmath22 @xmath75 there will be @xmath621% more clusters included in the lcdcs sample than in the emss sample due to the larger scatter in optically estimated mass .",
    "redshift uncertainties lead to a similar bias in which the more numerous , poorer clusters at @xmath41@xmath300.4 are scattered into the relevant redshift range .",
    "although poorer , the surface brightnesses of these systems can be comparable to the more massive clusters at @xmath41@xmath90.4 because of the redshift dependence of @xmath10 .",
    "we again use the ps formalism to compute the expected number of clusters above the lcdcs detection threshold as a function of redshift , and then convolve this distribution with the redshift uncertainty ( see @xcite for the functional form of the redshift uncertainty ) .",
    "the redshift bias introduces an additional 19% increase in the observed surface density .",
    "finally , contamination of the lcdcs sample by sources such as low surface brightness galaxies also boosts the observed surface density . for the redshift range 0.4@xmath30@xmath41@xmath300.6",
    ", we expect , on the basis of spectroscopy and imaging , that @xmath6 80% of the sources are real clusters @xcite .",
    "accounting for all of the issues described above yields a corrected lcdcs surface density of @xmath98 clusters per square degree with @xmath33@xmath910@xmath99@xmath100 ergs s@xmath22 .",
    "the emss contains five systems with bolometric luminosity @xmath33@xmath910@xmath101 ergs s@xmath22 @xmath75 in this redshift range . following the method of @xcite and @xcite , we compute the number density of emss clusters and obtain a comoving density of 9.6@xmath102 mpc@xmath103 for @xmath104=1 , @xmath105 , which corresponds to a projected density of ( 1.6@xmath790.7)@xmath106 clusters per square degree , where the quoted error is purely poissonian .",
    "this value is 4.5 times smaller than the lcdcs value .",
    "why such a large discrepancy ?",
    "massive clusters are strongly correlated ( see @xcite for an analysis of the lcdcs ) and the lcdcs sample includes rx j1347.5 , which is the most luminous known x - ray cluster .",
    "several other massive clusters are in close proximity to rx j1347.5 , and consequently , the inadvertent inclusion of this particularly rich region of space in the lcdcs positively biases our computed angular density . to estimate the magnitude by which this correlation may impact the results , we recompute the angular density using only clusters that are at least 30 arcmin away from rx j1347.5 ( @xmath107 mpc at z=0.5 ) . with this restriction",
    "we have only 4 clusters in the remaining 60 square degrees ( i.e. 56% of the most massive clusters in the lcdcs at 0.4@xmath76@xmath41@xmath300.6 are located within a region corresponding to 15% of the total survey area ) .",
    "including correction for the statistical biases cited above yields a revised angular density of ( 3.7@xmath108 clusters per square degree for the lcdcs .",
    "this value is 50% lower than that derived for the entire survey and not significantly ( @xmath109 ) discrepant with the emss value .",
    "we conclude that the two surveys are marginally consistent with one another but that even in surveys that span over 100 sq . degrees it is possible to be significantly ( factor of two ) affected by large scale clustering . in particular , given that the number density from the lcdcs is larger than that from the emss , we conclude that the lcdcs is not missing a large number of potential lensing clusters out to at least @xmath110 .      the degree to which we have identified all of the possible lensing clusters within the lcdcs for our follow - up imaging depends on the validity of the @xmath19mass relationship and its scatter .",
    "the empirical relation between the surface brightness of the original low surface brightness detection image and the mass of a cluster is only broadly established @xcite .",
    "we will continue to test and refine this relationship because with a large survey it is necessary to develop a method to estimate cluster masses , even crudely , from the original survey data .",
    "subsamples can then be explored in greater detail , as done here .",
    "the ediscs program will provide velocity dispersions and weak lensing maps for @xmath111 lcdcs clusters . here , with a larger sample , but cruder data , we examine whether the number of luminous galaxies in a cluster , which is correlated with cluster mass ( see @xcite ) , correlates with @xmath14 .    in figure [",
    "fig : ngal ] we plot the number of galaxies within our images brighter than a limit set above our estimated completeness , n@xmath112 .",
    "we do not correct for the differences among estimated luminosity distances for the clusters because such corrections correlate for n@xmath112 and @xmath14 , and hence the redshift errors would create an apparent correlation .",
    "we exclude the cluster candidate confirmed to be a low surface brightness galaxy ( lcdcs 801 ) and the two suspected as arising from tidal debris among interacting galaxies ( lcdcs 857 and 899 ) . despite the lack of a correction for the redshift effects on either n@xmath112 or @xmath14 , the lack of a correction for any foreground / background galaxy contamination ( our fields - of - view are too small to do a locally - determined background correction ) , and the inclusion of the marginal clusters , there is a weak correlation between @xmath14 and n@xmath112 ( spearman rank correlation coefficient 0.22 , probability of random occurrence 0.15 ) .",
    "although the correlation has significant scatter , of the 14 cluster fields with @xmath9 80 galaxies in our images all but one have @xmath113 , the median @xmath14 of our sample .",
    "selecting high @xmath14 clusters does not guarantee clusters with many galaxies , but it does nearly guarantee that such clusters will be among the sample .",
    "the scatter in the correlation comes primarily from clusters with high @xmath14 that upon further examination appear to be poorer clusters than expected .",
    "the high measured value of @xmath14 is presumably the result of a poorly subtracted galaxy halo , scattered light , coincident galactic infrared cirrus , or some other contamination .",
    "although it is evident that significant scatter exists and a sample sharply defined by @xmath14 will not be sharply defined in any other cluster property ( such as richness or mass ) , it is sufficient for culling , albeit sometimes inefficiently , the richest ( and presumably most massive ) clusters .",
    "accepting the two lensing clusters as the only ones in the lcdcs sample at these redshifts , then the incidence of clusters that produce giant arcs over the redshift range @xmath1 that are brighter than @xmath114 and have @xmath115 is @xmath116 deg@xmath93 .",
    "the uncertainties reflect only poisson noise ( they do not include the effects of large scale structure and do not reflect the various reasons discussed previously that make this a lower limit on the lensing incidence ) .    the largest directed search for giant arcs in clusters is the study by @xcite of 38 x - ray selected clusters , @xmath117 ergs s@xmath22 at @xmath118 .",
    "they find strong lensing ( @xmath119 and @xmath115 ) in 8 of the 38 clusters ( plus some arclets and some suggestive features ) . of the most x - ray luminous clusters ( @xmath37 ergs s@xmath22 ) they find 60% ( 3 of 5 ) contain giant arcs , while none ( 0 of 15 ) of the least x - ray luminous clusters ( @xmath120 ergs s@xmath22 contain giant arcs . ) .",
    "these are clusters drawn from the _ einstein observatory _ extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ; @xcite , @xcite ) which for @xmath121 covered 734.7 sq .",
    "degrees @xcite .",
    "most of their clusters are at @xmath122 because the x - ray survey is most sensitive to the nearer clusters .",
    "they detect 2 clusters with giant arcs at @xmath123 . to compare to the lcdcs we need to determine the survey area over which they would have found these clusters .",
    "the survey is not complete to all flux limits in the catalog across all fields . for ms0451.6 - 0305 ( z = 0.55 ,",
    "@xmath124 ergs s@xmath22 ) , the effective survey area is 720.6 sq",
    ". degrees . for ms2053.7 - 0449 ( z = 0.583",
    ", @xmath125 ergs s@xmath22 ) , the effective survey area is 225.4 sq .",
    "naively , one would simply add 1/720.6 and 1/225.4 to obtain the lensing incidence of 0.0058 , which is smaller than the lcdcs rate .",
    "however , part of the reason that their value is so low is because the emss survey is incomplete for clusters at redshifts between 0.5 and 0.7 . for a given @xmath33 each cluster",
    "is observed over some fraction of the volume between these redshifts . for ms0451 that fraction corresponds to 0.93 , while for ms2053 it corresponds to 0.32 .",
    "assuming that the number density of lensing clusters is uniform throughout this volume , we can correct the observed values for incompleteness .",
    "doing so , we derive that the lensing incidence measured using the emss and the @xcite study for @xmath4 is @xmath126 deg@xmath93 .",
    "we conclude that our measurement is in agreement with that from the emss , although both measurements are compromised by small number statistics .",
    "although we can not proceed further with this comparison due to the small number of systems involved , the marginally lower lensing incidence in the emss area at @xmath4 may in part be connected to the lower number of massive clusters identified in the emss relative to the lcdcs at these redshifts ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "@xcite present the discovery of one high - redshift ( 0.77 ) cluster with strongly - lensed arcs .",
    "however , they also provide a preview of what their entire survey might find .",
    "this is an interesting , if slightly premature , comparison because their survey is based on an independent method of finding clusters over a comparable survey volume .",
    "they have found six clusters with strong lensing to date in their survey , but because @xcite focus on the one at @xmath127 there are few details of the others ( an image of another at @xmath128 is presented by @xcite ) .",
    "the six have been found in @xmath129% of the survey data ( the survey in its entirety will cover @xmath130 sq .",
    "the photometric redshifts of the lensing clusters are all @xmath9 0.5 .",
    "therefore , the complete survey may be expected to yield 12 strong lensing clusters at @xmath4 .",
    "to best match the situation with the rcs , we include one lcdcs lensing cluster ( rx j1347.5 ) at slightly below @xmath24 because the photometric redshift uncertainty would allow it to be at @xmath131 and one lcdcs cluster observed as part of the ediscs survey @xcite that shows arcs even though its arcs may not satisfy the @xmath115 criteria that we will use to compare to the simulated lensing incidence . from these four lcdcs",
    "lensing clusters we set a lower - limit incidence of lensing at @xmath4 of @xmath132 deg@xmath93 , about half of what is preliminarily the case for the red cluster sequence survey ( @xmath133 deg@xmath93 ) , but within @xmath134 .    although the discrepancy is only marginally significant , there are various possible explanations for a difference : ( 1 ) the rcs lenses may not satisfy the same criteria ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , or magnitude limit ) as the lcdcs lenses and so the numbers may not be directly comparable , ( 2 ) there may be more lenses lurking in the lcdcs ( we have not deeply imaged all rich - cluster candidates ) , and ( 3 ) the lcdcs and rcs may select different clusters , with the lcdcs in some way selecting against  good \" lensing clusters .",
    "we can not comment further on possibility ( 1 ) until the full rcs results are published . examining figure [ fig : masscut ] , and assuming that the correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath33 is reasonably tight , we find that we have imaged 13 of 21 candidate clusters expected to have @xmath135 ergs s@xmath22 within @xmath136 ( this includes low - priority targets ) . making a completeness correction suggests that one of the unobserved clusters ( assuming that the low - priority targets are indeed clusters ) would have an arc .",
    "these numbers would suggest that the solution to the possible discrepancy does not lie entirely with unobserved clusters in our sample at @xmath137 .",
    "however , at @xmath138 we see that our sample becomes much more seriously incomplete and that because of volume effects the sample potentially includes a large number of very massive clusters . among our lensing clusters at @xmath4 ,",
    "1 of 4 is at @xmath138 - if this ratio holds true for the rcs sample , then the full rcs may have only 9 lensing clusters at @xmath64 and a lensing rate of @xmath139 deg@xmath93 , which is less discrepant with our measurement .",
    "the agreement in the projected number densities of massive clusters and in the lensing incidence between the x - ray selected emss and the lcdcs argues against option ( 3 ) .",
    "regardless of any potentially significant difference between the lcdcs and the final rcs lensing rates , there are some key agreements coming from these various studies : ( 1 ) massive clusters that produce giant arcs exist out to @xmath69 , ( 2 ) lensing clusters can be identified from optical surveys at these redshifts at the incidence of 1 to 2 per 20 sq . degrees ( leading to a prediction of over 2000 such clusters in the entire sky ) , and ( 3 ) the number of lenses found in optically - selected cluster surveys is not qualitatively different than in an x - ray selected cluster survey ( although initial x - ray selection will definitely improve the odds of starting with a sample of the likeliest lensing clusters ) .    the potential use of arc statistics as a cosmological constraint led to theoretical efforts to estimate the lensing rate in various cosmologies .",
    "@xcite published their predictions for the total numbers of lenses across the sky in three archetypical models ( standard cdm ( with a tilted power spectrum ) , open cdm , and @xmath0cdm ) .",
    "a comparison of the predictions and our results is of interest and provides a glimpse into what may be possible with both more detailed simulations and larger observational samples .",
    "the principal result of the @xcite study is that different cosmologies predict lensing rates that vary by orders of magnitude . in particular ,",
    "their open cdm model predicts 2400 strongly lensing clusters and their @xmath0cdm model predicts 280 across the sky .",
    "the properties of the simulated arcs ( magnitude limit @xmath140 and @xmath141 ) are similar to those presented here ( the lenses presented here are brighter than @xmath142 and have @xmath115 , @xmath143 ) . assuming poisson statistics and the predicted lensing rates , we calculate that the probability of finding 2 or more strongly lensing clusters within 69 sq .",
    "degrees ( at any redshift ) is 0.08 .",
    "if we include the other known lcdcs lensing cluster that satisfies the criteria ( rx j1347.5 ; @xcite identified multiple arcs , with one arc having @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 ) we find that the probability of finding 3 or more clusters within 69 sq .",
    "degrees is 0.012 ( the brightest arc in the lensing cluster identified in the ediscs survey does not satisfy the @xmath115 criteria although it has @xmath147 ) .",
    "therefore , even the lensing incidence that we have measured , which is a lower limit , is in statistically significant contradiction to the predictions of a @xmath0cdm model .    to further strengthen the statistics of the argument",
    ", we combine the results from the lcdcs and rcs . from the rcs ,",
    "the images of two lensing clusters have been published ( @xcite , @xcite ) . while quantitative measures of the geometry of the arcs are not presented , they appear to satisfy the @xmath115 criteria . however , one system is slightly fainter than @xmath142 and the magnitude for the second system is not published . including just these two clusters , although @xcite have identified six lensing clusters in roughly half the survey area ( 50 sq .",
    "degrees ) , we have a total of five strongly lensing clusters over 119 sq . degrees .",
    "the probability of finding this many clusters in such an area of sky in the @xmath0cdm model is @xmath148 .",
    "although including these systems increases the statistical significance of the discrepancy , the discrepancy is significant even with only the three lcdcs systems .",
    "it is interesting to note that various surveys are leading to the same conclusion and that in combination they may already provide exceedingly strong statistical constraints .",
    "we conclude that the observations are discrepant with the predictions of the @xmath0cdm model as constructed by @xcite .",
    "we note that the application of the @xcite results is not entirely consistent with this observational sample because they focused on clusters at @xmath149 and source galaxies at @xmath150 .",
    "we are likely to have some source galaxies at @xmath151 , although the primary lensed images are quite bright ( @xmath152 ) and so are unlikely to be very distant objects ( a counterexample is presented by @xcite in that one of their arcs is a galaxy at @xmath153 ) .",
    "as argued by bartelmann et al .",
    ", galaxies that produce arcs with @xmath154 are likely to be galaxies with intrinsic @xmath155 , which are in turn likely to be at @xmath150 .",
    "evidently , the models must be constructed to more accurately represent these samples , but our results and conclusions are in direct agreement with those of bartelmann et al.s based on the results from the independent emss .    to increase the lensing rates in the models ( see @xcite ) ,",
    "there have been appeals to certain cluster properties such as strong asymmetry and presence of a massive central concentration ( such as the bcg ) . in support of some missing ingredient in the models",
    ", we note that there are now at least two known strongly lensing clusters at @xmath156 , where all of the @xcite models predict a negligible likelihood of lensing .",
    "however , subsequent studies ( @xcite , @xcite ) that examined the effect of substructure and asymmetries found only moderate changes from the previous results .",
    "in contrast to another challenge to the cdm framework , the compactness of galaxy cores , any solutions to that challenge that affects the concentration of all cdm cluster halos will exacerbate the discrepancy between the predicted and observed number of strong lenses @xcite .",
    "a recent study @xcite finds promise in progressing beyond the simple cosmological constant and altering the equation of state .",
    "the simulations are currently challenged to achieve both sufficient resolution to trace cluster substructure and model a sufficiently large volume of the universe to include enough of the most massive clusters ( for example see @xcite ) . in particular , the scatter in halo properties must be accounted for because the most concentrated systems will dominate the lensing incidence @xcite .",
    "when such simulations exist , one should match not only the total number of lensing clusters , but also their redshift distribution in order to constrain the growth of structures in the universe and the underlying cosmological framework .",
    "we conclude that the data are now at a sufficient stage to motivate a new exploration of the theoretical models .",
    "we have examined a subsample of cluster candidates drawn from the las campanas distant cluster survey ( lcdcs ) for evidence of strong gravitational lensing .",
    "we conclude the following :    \\1 ) over the redshifts range we have explored most extensively ( @xmath64 ) we have identified two previously unknown strongly lensing systems and a third possible system ( see table 1 ) among a subsample of lcdcs clusters . using only the two secure lensing systems from these three , we set a lower limit on the incidence of strong lensing in this redshift range of @xmath157 deg@xmath93 .",
    "\\2 ) over the entire redshift range of the lcdcs ( @xmath158 ) we now know of four secure lensing systems ( including one previously known one , rx j1347.5 and one that is part of the ediscs sample @xcite ) .",
    "of these four , the arcs in ediscs lensing cluster may not satisfy the generally adopted magnitude and size criteria . retaining only the three other lensing systems , we set a lower limit on the incidence of strong lensing in this redshift range of @xmath159 deg@xmath93 .",
    "\\3 ) our lower limit on the lensing incidence at @xmath4 agrees within the uncertainties with the measurement based on the results from a study of emss clusters ( @xmath126 deg@xmath93 ; @xcite ) and the preliminary results from the red cluster sequence survey ( somewhere between 0.06 to 0.12 deg@xmath93 ; @xcite ) .",
    "\\4 ) the empirical values for the number of strongly lensing clusters are significantly higher than the prediction of the @xmath0cdm model from @xcite .",
    "the probability of finding 3 or more strongly lensing clusters in the lcdcs s 69 sq .",
    "degrees is 0.012 .",
    "the discrepancy between the observed and predicted rates for the @xmath0cdm model is in agreement with the conclusion of @xcite based on their comparison to the results from the emss clusters .",
    "although our study has confirmed the discrepancy between observations and theoretical expectations in the  concordance \" model , we have used the same theoretical results , namely those presented by @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy indicates a problem with the theoretical models either with the generally accepted concordance cosmological model ( because the predictions from an open cdm model are in much better agreement with the observations ) , the specifics of the cluster formation and resulting gravitational potential , or the assumed background population .",
    "the next step is to reexamine the models to see if an order of magnitude increase in the lensing rate for what has become the standard cosmological model , @xmath160 , is at all possible .",
