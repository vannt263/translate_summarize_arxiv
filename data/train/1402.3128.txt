    "photoexcitation or photoionization processes are among the most common tools to study the structures of matters . for atomic or molecular systems , the details in the spectroscopy reveal the information at the microscopic regime such as the energy levels , decay rates , and transition strengths between the quantum states .",
    "a large amount of data has been obtained and recorded by synchrotron radiations up to the x - ray regimes . due to the limited brilliance of the light sources , or the limited intensity of the fields ,",
    "normally only single - photon processes are considered in synchrotron measurements .",
    "although it can be very precise and reliable to obtain the atomic energy levels , the dipole - forbidden states ( dfss ) with respect to the ground state are not accessible . nonetheless , these dfss are essential in numerous optical techniques or subjects including electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite , two - photon absorption  @xcite , raman spectroscopy and more .",
    "it is noteworthy that some of these or similar quantum phenomena have been reconsidered in ultrafast optical configurations  @xcite and attract much attention , where their interpretations are based on the dynamics involving dfss . until now",
    "the aspiration for better measurements or characterizations of dfss is tremendous .    in recent years , there are renewed interests in the studies of fano resonances and the corresponding autoionizing states ( aiss ) , which have long been perceived in the energy domain as interpreted by fano more than 50 years ago  @xcite .",
    "the new interests are founded on the developments in ultrashort light sources and ultrafast optical techniques .",
    "the eit effect between the coupled aiss was observed by time - delayed transient absorption in the femtosecond timescale  @xcite .",
    "the time - domain measurements of the autoionization dynamics using attosecond pulses were reported in argon  @xcite and in helium  @xcite .",
    "most recently , the fano line shapes modulated by time - delayed intense fields in transient absorption spectroscopy have been measured and analyzed  @xcite , which has also brought to light the astounding potential to shape and to control the attosecond pulses  @xcite . in these studies and the related theoretical works ,",
    "the dynamics of the fano wave packet were mostly implemented as attosecond streaking  @xcite or resonant coupling  @xcite of the fano states , if not carried out by _ ab initio _",
    "calculations  @xcite which were numerically expensive and less intuitive . while the attention has been put on the directly measurable resonances under the dressing field , the properties of the dipole - forbidden resonances ( dfrs ) in the coupling were largely overlooked . in this work",
    ", we aim to provide a model describing the realistic coupling between the aiss where the dfrs can be `` probed '' , and their essential properties can be characterized .    taking the helium atom in the energy range near the @xmath3 resonance as an example , we carry out an _ ab initio _ two - active - electron time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tae - tdse ) based on the time - dependent hyperspherical ( tdhs ) method  @xcite to virtually provide the reference experimental data",
    ". then a multilevel model with parametrized atomic structure is developed and applied to the case , where the comparison to the virtual experiment optimizes the atomic parameters of the dfrs . in our previous model consisting of coupled aiss  @xcite , the transitions between the aiss were reduced to the transitions involving only the bound states  bound - bound ( b - b ) transitions  by ignoring the second - order ( two - electron ) transitions .",
    "this naive picture successfully predicted the inversion of fano line shapes under intense dressing fields , but the effects on the dfrs were missing .",
    "the present model includes the transitions between the discrete states and the background continua ( bound - continuum , b - c ) , and between the background continua of different symmetries ( continuum - continuum , c - c ) . with ultrashort dressing fields ,",
    "the significance of the b - c and c - c transitions is justified because these transitions take place in such a short time when electrons are still near the ionic core , and the distorted continuum waves are far from plane waves .",
    "this improved picture emphasizes the influences of these added transitions in the dressing field on the fano line shapes of all resonances , including the dfrs .",
    "this signature broadly implies that in ultrafast dynamics , even in weak fields in the sense of few - photon transitions , the implementation or neglection of the c - c transitions needs to be reconsidered carefully , especially for ultrashort overlapping pulses .",

    "the present model describes the dynamics of an autoionizing wave packet in an atom consisting of the aiss of two different symmetries , which are pumped by a weak euv attosecond pulse and dressed by a relatively strong ( tw/@xmath4 ) femtosecond laser pulse .",

    "a clear feature seen in the figure is that the middle flat part of the spectrum oscillates alone @xmath123 with roughly half optical cycles ( 0.9  fs ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : delay_0 ] , with the alternating phase , @xmath126 is coherently added to @xmath146 to give the interference pattern oscillating in full optical cycles . on the contrary ,",
    "the @xmath126 spectra at the @xmath130 and @xmath131 resonances remain stable over @xmath123 .",
    "the latter features come from the euv excitation of @xmath79 and the subsequent laser transition to @xmath130 and @xmath131 before @xmath79 decays .",

    "2.5  fs of the @xmath90 partial waves by the tae - tdse calculations ( top panel ) and the present model ( bottom panel ) , in logarithmic scale and in 20-db dynamic range .",
    "the strength of the middle flat part of the spectrum oscillates with @xmath123 in the period of half optical cycle and is weakened as the laser pulse lags behind the euv pulse , but the resonance parts sustain over large time delays.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the sideband - like signals at @xmath130 and @xmath131 extend in the time delay up to @xmath156  fs .",
    "the formation of the sideband pattern corresponds to two ionization pathways  the direct euv ionization to @xmath110 , and the euv+vis ionization through @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the sidebands at both @xmath130 and @xmath131 vanish as @xmath123 approaches the @xmath79 decay lifetime ( 17  fs ) , where the second ionization pathway effectively stops .",
    "the slopes of the tilted fringes on both resonances change along @xmath123 , which are controlled by the phase differences between @xmath79 and @xmath130 and between @xmath79 and @xmath131 , respectively , in the duration after the euv excitation and before the vis kicks in .",
    "this feature of tilted fringes has been explained by several attosecond ionization studies  @xcite .      at @xmath122 ,",
    "the effective bandwidth of the laser that corresponds to the dynamics of the wave packet initiated by the euv pump is 0.9  ev . considering this laser bandwidth , the signals in 34 - 37  ev of the @xmath126 spectrum , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : xl ] and [ fig : delay_s ] , are only from the laser coupling with the @xmath110 background continuum instead of with the @xmath79 state . while the c - c dipole matrix elements are fixed values with the atomic structure , the signals in 34 - 37  ev vary closely with the laser field in @xmath123 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delay_s ] , i.e. , when the euv pulse is on top of the local peaks of the laser field , the signals are strong , and when the euv pulse is at the zero field of the laser , the signals attenuate .",
    "such behavior suggests that the c - c transition is only significant at the beginning of the euv ionization when the electrons are still at the neighborhood of the atomic core . on the other hand ,",
    "the excitation of @xmath79 lasts long after the euv pulse , and thus the b - b coupling between @xmath79 and @xmath130 or @xmath131 is insensitive to the time delay between the laser and euv pulses .    to elucidate the role of the c - c coupling responsible for signals in 34 - 37  ev in the @xmath126 and @xmath127 spectra , beside the full model calculation with all the original retrieved dipole matrix elements ( described in sec .",
    "[ sec : ml - tdse ] ) , we made two extra calculations with only the nonresonant ( c - c ) and only the resonant ( b - b and b - c ) ones , respectively , for @xmath122 and 3  fs .",
    "the @xmath157  fs case is for non - overlapping pulses where the laser comes later than the euv .",
    "the resultant @xmath126 electron spectra are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dip ] . in the nonresonant ,",
    "@xmath122 case , the spectrum reproduces the 3437  ev part of the full calculation very well . at @xmath130 and @xmath131",
    ", the resonance peaks shrink to two slight bumps , which are the results of the configuration interaction to the continuum .",
    "when the laser is delayed to @xmath157  fs , the overall nonresonant signals drop dramatically , where the bumps at 33 and 37.6  ev indicate the `` actual bandwidth '' 0.5  ev of the laser .",
    "the effect of the c - c coupling is substantial only if the two pulses overlap , or more specifically , the euv overlaps the local maximum of the laser field , where the euv - excited continuum electrons can be driven by the laser . on the contrary , in the resonant case ,",
    "the flat part remains 0 , and the @xmath130 and @xmath131 peaks retain .",
    "the bandwidth of the laser slightly changes the line widths of the resonances , but it has no effect on the empty spectral range in 3437  ev .     partial wave for three sets of dipole matrix elements by the model calculation .",
    "the first set includes all the dipole matrix elements , while the second and the third sets include just the nonresonant ( c - c ) and just the resonant dipole matrix elements ( b - b and b - c ) , respectively .",
    "the peak laser intensity is fixed at 1  tw/@xmath4 .",
    "the euv either overlaps the laser peak or leads in time by 3  fs.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the short - time behavior of the photoelectrons described above can be alternatively explained and reaffirmed by analyzing the motion of the electron wave packet in the coordinate space .",
    "determined by the euv , the wave packet has the central kinetic energy around @xmath79 at 35.6  ev , corresponding to the velocity of 67  a.u./fs and the momentum of @xmath158  a.u . for photoelectrons along , the asymptotic condition of the continuum wave is determined by @xmath159 , and the `` core '' size of the system can be defined by @xmath160  a.u . for bound electrons ,",
    "the core size can be defined by the bound orbitals , which are less than 1  a.u . for @xmath161 . within the core range ,",
    "the emitted electrons still have the chance to interact with each other or with bound electrons . considering the core size and the average velocity , it takes less than 20  as for the wave packet to leave the core , which is significantly shorter than the 0.9  fs half optical cycle of the laser . in other words , the photoelectrons right after the euv ionization are bound - like only instantly in terms of a laser optical cycle before they dissipate away . as a result , in fig .",
    "[ fig : delay_s ] , the 3437  ev signals follow the instantaneous intensity of the laser closely .",
    "meanwhile the excited @xmath79 state holds electrons in the timescale of tens of femtoseconds where the laser couples @xmath79 to the surrounding of @xmath130 and @xmath131 , e.g. at 37.5  ev , which shows the slow attenuation of signals along @xmath123 .",
    "the above demonstration shows that the c - c transition in the coupled autoionizing systems is nonnegligible even in moderately intense fields , in a short period of time after the ionizing pulse .",
    "this is in contrast to the common assumption in previous studies to neglect c - c transitions when applying long pulses  @xcite and ultrashort pulses  @xcite . by fitting the model to the tae - tdse result , the c -",
    "c dipole matrix elements @xmath162 and @xmath163 are determined to be about 1  a.u./ev .",
    "this quantity is equivalent to a 0.1-a.u .",
    "dipole matrix element between the discrete states of the same widths of @xmath79 and @xmath130 , which is 15 times smaller @xmath164 .",
    "a general technique has been developed and tested to retrieve the properties of the dfrs in the autoionization region .",
    "an iap with a synchronized short dressing pulse are applied to an atomic system to obtain the photoelectron spectra .",
    "the simulations are carried out by a multilevel model and a tae - tdse program , where their comparison characterizes the dfrs , in particular the dipole matrix elements of the transitions involving dfrs .",
    "ultrafast technology is critical in this technique for the broadband excitation to cover the resonance region in concern .",
    "the multilevel model successfully recovers the electron wave packet for laser intensities up to 1  tw/@xmath4 .",
    "surprisingly , it shows that the c - c transition by the laser coupling contributes significantly in the photoelectron spectra when the laser overlaps the euv pulse .",
    "it indicates the correlation effect between the `` free '' photoelectrons before they move away from the core , in comparison with the bound - state coupling that has been well studied in laser - dressed systems .",
    "the effect depends on the proximity between the electrons and is controlled by the timing of the laser pulse .",
    "the general technique developed here would help the identification and characterization of dfrs for applications involving multiphoton processes , and would utilize the most advanced ultrafast optical technologies in atomic and molecular studies .",
    "an algorithm to automatically optimize the dfr parameters could be developed in the future .",
