    "the diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) are over 300 interstellar absorption bands commonly observed toward reddened stars from the uv to the near - ir , and whose carrier molecules are still unidentified @xcite .",
    "the identification of the carriers of these bands remains an important problem in astronomy to date and the current consensus on the nature of the carriers is that they are probably large carbon - bearing molecules that reside ubiquitously in the interstellar gas @xcite .",
    "the most promising carrier candidates are carbon chains , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , and fullerenes @xcite .",
    "studies on the environmental behavior of dib carriers suggest that the strength of the dibs results from an interplay between ionization , recombination , dehydrogenation and destruction of chemically stable , carbonaceous species @xcite .",
    "the molecular nature of the dib carriers is supported by the detection of substructures in the line profiles of some dibs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a recent analysis of the profile of the strongest dib ( @xmath04428 ) shows a lorentzian profile remarkably consistent with rapid internal conversion in a molecular carrier @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we present an analysis of high - resolution observations of the @xmath06614 dib in so - called single - cloud lines of sight .",
    "the profiles show a systematic variation in the wavelengths of the observed substructure peaks .",
    "we show that these variations are most naturally explained as changes in the rotational excitation temperature in rotational contours of a large molecule .",
    "the particular band profile of this dib also allows one to uniquely determine the rotational excitation temperature .",
    "the @xmath06614 dib was first observed at high resolution by @xcite , revealing a clear triple - peak substructure and a red degraded wing ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dib6614:allprofiles ] ) . in a few stars , a weaker fourth and a fifth peak show up at longer wavelengths . as these",
    "are only clearly observed in two of our spectra , we will not discuss these peaks in this letter .",
    "the substructures are intrinsic to the band profile , as the same profile shape is observed in lines of sight that only cross one interstellar cloud .",
    "the very presence of these substructures has been explained by two different scenarios .",
    "the most popular explanation is that the profile is due to unresolved rotational contours of a large molecule , in which the three peaks represent individual branches of a rovibronic transition .",
    "rotational contour calculations have been performed by @xcite and @xcite for pahs , by @xcite for fullerenes and by @xcite for linear chains .",
    "@xcite analyzed the profiles of the @xmath06614 dib and compared them to calculated rotational contours , concluding that the carrier of the @xmath06614 dib has a rotational constant compatible with pahs larger than 40 c atoms , chains of 12 - 18 c atoms , 30 c atom rings , or c@xmath1 fullerene compounds .",
    "alternatively , the substructures might be due to isotope shifts in large , highly symmetric molecules @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the individual peaks correspond to entities of the same molecule with a different number of @xmath2c atoms .",
    "the relative intensities of the peaks then determine the abundances of the isotopic varieties ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite presented new high - resolution ( @xmath3 220000 ) , high signal - to - noise ratio observations of the @xmath06614 dib toward single - cloud lines of sight , clearly showing variability in the precise wavelengths of the peaks , and in the intensity ratios . in this letter , we analyze those same observations ; we therefore refer to @xcite for more observational details .",
    "the profiles of the interstellar or lines toward our target stars are narrow , and generally show only one main component @xcite , confirmed also by ultra - high resolution observations for various interstellar lines that are now available ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein )",
    ". the observed dib profiles are therefore intrinsic .",
    "[ fig : dib6614:allprofiles ] shows the profiles of the @xmath06614 dib centered on the central peak .",
    "it is clear that there are considerable variations in the exact positions of the remaining two main peaks with respect to this central peak .",
    "the redward peak ( peak 3 ) shows clear variations in wavelength relative to the central peak that are much larger than the individual variations in radial velocity , and therefore these variations are intrinsic . to assess the nature of these variations , we proceeded in the following way . in all proposed explanations for the substructure of the @xmath06614 dib ,",
    "the observed profile is composed of individual bands . in the rotational contour framework",
    ", these bands correspond to unresolved ro - vibronic branches ; in the isotope shift scenario they correspond to different isotopomers . to accurately determine the peak positions of these individual components , we need to first decompose the profile into its components , rather than measuring the peak positions directly in the observed profile .",
    "@xcite showed that nearly perfect fits to the observed line profiles can be achieved by fitting about five gaussians to the line profiles .",
    "the three main gaussian components correspond to the three main peaks observed in the line profile ; a fourth and fifth component are required for the additional peaks and/or the red wing .",
    "we followed a similar approach to decompose the profile into gaussian components .",
    "the fitting routine provides a formal error estimate on the derived parameters ( such as peak position ) which is generally optimistic since it does not deal with systematic errors  such as the components not being true gaussians .",
    "we therefore followed a statistical approach in which we determined the noise level on the spectra from the continuum parts outside the @xmath06614 dib , subsequently added random noise with the same rms to the entire spectrum , and then fitted the profile .",
    "this procedure was repeated 100 times for each spectrum , and subsequently each parameter value was taken to be the average of these 100 simulations , with the standard deviation providing a more realistic error estimate on the parameters . using the wavelengths of the central peak ( peak 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dib6614:allprofiles ] ) , we then shifted the individual profiles in velocity space to the same `` rest '' wavelength of 6613.56   for the central peak @xcite .",
    "[ fig : dib6614:peakshifsts ] shows the peak positions for each of the three main peaks as a function of the peak separation between the first and the third peak .",
    "the variations in the wavelengths of the sub - peaks now become much more obvious .",
    "when the redward peak ( peak 3 ) shifts to longer wavelengths relative to the central peak , the blueward peak ( peak 1 ) _ systematically _ shifts to shorter wavelengths . whereas peak 1 shifts by about 0.03 (one resolution element ) , peak 3 shifts by twice that amount .",
    "these variations rule out the scenario in which the substructures are due to isotope shifts ; in such a case , the wavelengths of the individual peaks should be the same for each line of sight .",
    "on the other hand , the observed variations are completely consistent with the substructure being due to unresolved rotational contours and the observed variations due to changes in only one the rotational excitation temperature .",
    "in the framework of rotational contours , the three peaks in the @xmath06614 dib correspond to unresolved @xmath4-type branches associated with a molecular species . for any molecular species ,",
    "the peak positions of these branches are determined by both molecular properties and physical parameters ( such as the rotational temperature ) . the added value from this work  where we observe _ variations _ in the peak positions  stems from the fact that the molecular properties should be the same for all lines of sight . moreover ,",
    "the triple - peak structure of the @xmath06614 dib profile allows one to determine the molecular and physical parameters independently .",
    "this is most easily illustrated for molecules exhibiting a linear or spherical top geometry . for linear ( e.g. ,  co@xmath5 , n@xmath5o ) or",
    "spherical top ( e.g. , fullerenes ) geometries , the energies of the rotational levels within a vibronic band are determined by the single rotational constant @xmath6 and the quantum number @xmath7 ( angular momentum ) .",
    "selection rules on @xmath7 are @xmath8 ( @xmath9- and @xmath10-branch transitions ) and , in some cases ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) , @xmath11 ( @xmath12-branch ) . for a given rotational level @xmath7 , the frequencies of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 transitions relative to the corresponding @xmath12 transition",
    "can then be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; the double primes refer to the lower vibronic level and @xmath16 is the difference in rotational constants between the upper and lower vibronic level .",
    "furthermore , the common approximation has been used that @xmath17 .",
    "all other things being equal , the peak absorption will arise from the most populated rotational level in the lower vibronic state . assuming an lte - like population distribution of the rotational levels in this lower state",
    ", it is straightforward to show that the most populated rotational level is ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath18 with @xmath19 in units of @xmath20 .",
    "( [ eq : nu_rq ] ) , ( [ eq : nu_qp ] ) and ( [ eq : jmax ] ) nicely show how the peaks of the @xmath10- and @xmath9- branches move away from the @xmath12-branch peak ( at a different rate ) when @xmath21 increases ; as @xmath21 increases , @xmath22 becomes larger , and therefore both peak separations increase .",
    "this corresponds exactly to what we observe ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dib6614:peakshifsts ] ) , and therefore the central peak ( peak 2 ) in the @xmath06614 dib must correspond to the unresolved @xmath12-branch and peaks 1 and 3 to the @xmath10- and @xmath9-branches , respectively .",
    "the triple - peak structure of the @xmath06614 dib profile offers 14 independent measurements ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 for seven lines of sight ) for eight free parameters ( @xmath19 and seven rotational temperatures ) , so that all parameters can be uniquely determined . although it is possible to determine @xmath19 and @xmath25 independently for each line of sight by manipulating eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nu_rq])([eq : jmax ] ) , the uncertainties on the derived parameters are large .",
    "instead , we performed a @xmath26 minimization to determine the eight parameters that provide the best fit to the 14 observed peak separations and determined the 1 @xmath27 uncertainties on these parameters .",
    "the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ table : peakpositions2 ] and yield a reduced @xmath26-value of 1.45 , indicating a good , but not a perfect fit .",
    "the derived rotational constant ( 0.016 @xmath28 0.003 @xmath20 ) is compatible with published values for linear and aromatic molecules , e.g. , c@xmath29 ( 0.014 @xmath20 ; * ? ? ?",

    "the constant @xmath40 can have values @xmath41 so that each @xmath7 level is now split up into @xmath42 levels with different @xmath40-values . for prolate geometries ( where @xmath43 ) , these levels differ in energy by @xmath44 ; for oblate cases ( where @xmath45 , e.g.  c@xmath46h@xmath46 ) they differ by @xmath47 .",
    "additional selection rules are @xmath48 ( `` parallel '' transitions ) or @xmath49 ( `` perpendicular '' transitions )",
    ". the observed profile will now be the superposition of all @xmath4-branches arising from different @xmath40-values .    for parallel transitions from the @xmath50 level , the additional energy term vanishes , and therefore eqs .",

    "the frequencies of the transitions will change by @xmath52 or @xmath53 compared to the @xmath50 frequencies .",
    "these shifts are generally small , and therefore the overall shape of the profile in terms of peak positions will not change much .",
    "in such a case , the estimates of the rotational constant @xmath6 and the rotational temperature @xmath21 derived from the linear or spherical top case will still be good estimates .    for perpendicular bands ,",
    "the situation is more complex . for each @xmath40 , there are now two sets of @xmath4-branches .",
    "compared to the linear or spherical top case , the transitions in the first set shift to the blue and in the second to the red by an amount of typically @xmath54 for prolate tops or @xmath55 for oblate tops .",

    "when using the formalism for linear or spherical top geometries to determine @xmath21 , we will therefore generally overestimate @xmath21 for oblate geometries and underestimate @xmath21 for prolate geometries .",
    "the observed variations in the peak positions of the substructures in the @xmath06614 dib can be explained at least qualitatively in the rotational contour framework where the variations are due to changes in the rotational excitation temperature .",
    "the formalism for linear or spherical top geometries furthermore yields convenient expressions to uniquely determine @xmath19 and @xmath21 from the observed peak separations .",
    "crucial in this formalism is that the central peak in the observed @xmath06614 dib line profile is the @xmath12-branch .",
    "however , linear and spherical top molecules only exhibit @xmath12-branches for very specific vibronic transitions . in those cases ,",
    "the @xmath12-branch is generally much narrower than the @xmath9- and @xmath10-branches and in many cases also much stronger .",
    "the @xmath06614 dib , on the other hand , shows a central peak that has by and large the same width as the @xmath9- and @xmath10-branches , and a comparable strength .",
    "it seems therefore unlikely that the @xmath06614 dib carrier conforms to a linear or spherical top geometry .",
    "rather , the broadening of the @xmath12-branch is presumably due to the superposition of the various stacks in a prolate or oblate top molecule . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : rotational_contours ] , this means the values for @xmath25 in table  [ table : peakpositions2 ] are either too low ( prolate ) or too high ( oblate ) .",
    "it is interesting to note in this context that the detailed rotational contour calculations by @xcite for planar oblate tops ( where @xmath58 ) do indeed reproduce the width and strength of the observed subpeaks in the @xmath06614 dib profile .",
    "such detailed model calculations to compare to the @xmath06614 dib variations are in progress and will be presented in a future paper . however , for the value of @xmath19 we derived , the rotational temperatures from @xcite do indeed indicate slightly lower values than those in table  [ table : peakpositions2 ] .",
    "it is therefore tempting to conclude that the rotational temperatures for the @xmath06614 dib carrier are indeed relatively low and , as indicated in table  [ table : peakpositions2 ] , significantly lower than the kinetic gas temperature in the same lines of sight .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , as it has been argued that the rotational excitation temperature should actually be higher than the gas temperature ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . clearly , either the rotational excitation processes ( rocket effect , intramolecular vibration - rotation energy transfer , ... ) included in those calculations are less important than assumed or the relaxation processes are more efficient .",
    "however , these calculations are generally carried out for large ( @xmath59 100 c atoms ) pah - like molecules .",
    "smaller molecules or molecules of a different geometry might show a different excitation and relaxation balance .",

    "we have analyzed high - resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of the @xmath06614 dib toward single - cloud lines of sight .",
    "the spectra clearly show a systematic shift in the relative peak position of the subpeaks , shown here for the first time .",
    "this can not be understood if the substructure is due to isotope shifts . on the other hand , this effect can be explained both qualitatively and quantitatively by rotational contours in which only the rotational excitation temperature changes .",
