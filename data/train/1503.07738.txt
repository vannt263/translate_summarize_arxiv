    "<S> its field is expected to contain two major contributions , a quadrupolar field that is produced by the internal charge distribution of the molecule ( negative partial charges at the oxygen atoms , see [ fig3]a ) and a dipolar field due to the well - known electron transfer from ag(111 ) to ptcda upon adsorption @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we consider the observed agreement in magnitude a remarkable verification of the sqdm performance in quantitative mapping of the electrostatic potential . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining small discrepancy between the theory and the experiment can be explained by an effective increase of @xmath35 ( in comparison to the plate capacitor case ) caused by the strong curvature of the sharp metal tip used in the experiment . </S>",

    "<S> 4d shows that the smoluchowski dipole field of the adatom is indeed still detectable at a distance of @xmath54 from the surface .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have reported a scanning probe technique that is able to provide truly three - dimensional , so far elusive , maps of the electrostatic potential field with nanometer resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the current realization of scanning quantum dot microscopy ( sqdm ) is based on a single molecular quantum dot attached to the tip of a scanning probe microscope . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the power of sqdm by measuring the electrostatic potential fields of the smoluchowski dipole created by a single silver adatom and by the quadrupole moment of a single ptcda molecule . </S>",
    "<S> since the quantum dot serves as a sensor of the electrostatic potential which at the same time transduces this signal to a charging event , the technique is a particularly fascinating variant of the general sensor / transducer concept for scanning probe microscopy introduced earlier @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , however , the transduction involves electronic rather than the mechanical degrees of freedom that were utilized in previous work . as a consequence of its high sensitivity </S>",
    "<S> , sqdm can be applied to rough and high aspect ratio samples , opening the possibility to study , e.g. , semiconductor devices and biological samples . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the combination of high sensitivity and spatial resolution suggests the possibility of reading nanoscale electric memory cells entirely contact- and current - free . </S>",
    "<S> we note in passing that beside afm other detection schemes of the charging events are conceivable . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we stress that a molecular quantum dot , although particularly attractive , does not exhaust all possibilities . </S>",
    "<S> sqdm probes with nano - fabricated quantum dots on standard silicon afm cantilevers can be envisioned , extending the applicability beyond ultra - high vacuum and cryogenic temperatures .    </S>",
