    "the abundance of massive compact objects at very early cosmological epochs firmly constrains cosmological structure formation scenarios ( kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 , efstathiou & rees 1988 ) .",
    "this stimulates the search for quasars at the highest possible redshifts .",
    "radio and optical surveys have shown a pronounced increase in the co - moving number density of quasars out to a redshift of 1  2 , by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "there is now evidence that at @xmath12 the abundance of quasars declines ( warren et al .",
    "1994 ; schmidt et al . 1995 ; shaver et al .",
    "1999 ) , which may indicate that , at these redshifts , we witness the onset of quasar activity in the universe . however , recently , the evidence for this has been debated by jarvis & rawlings ( 2000 ) .",
    "whilst radio - loud quasars form only a small subset of the quasar population , the construction of radio - loud quasar samples is less prone to selection effects than are optical samples , since radio emission is unaffected by either intrinsic or extrinsic absorption due to dust .",
    "the most comprehensive and complete search for high redshift radio - loud quasars has been performed by hook et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 ) , who observed a complete sample of 161 @xmath6 mjy flat spectrum radio sources in an area of 7300 deg@xmath4 , which were selected on their red optical colours and unresolved optical counterparts . of these objects ,",
    "13 were found to be radio - loud quasars at @xmath7 , from which one was located at @xmath13 . in a similar fashion ,",
    "hook et al .",
    "( 1998 ) searched for high redshift radio - loud quasars among flat spectrum radio sources , about an order of magnitude fainter ( @xmath14 mjy ) than those studied previously .",
    "seventy - three objects were selected from a complete sample of 2902 radio sources , drawn from the greenbank 5 ghz survey and the first 1.4 ghz ( gregory & condon 1991 ; white et al .",
    "1997 ) in an area of 1600 deg@xmath4 with @xmath15 , of which 70% were spectroscopically observed .",
    "six of those were found to be radio loud quasars at @xmath7 , resulting in a surface density of one per 190 square degrees .    in this paper",
    "we report on a search for distant quasars in the cosmic lens all sky survey ( class , myers et al .",
    "2001 , in prep . ) , using an optical colour selection technique similar , but more stringent , to that used by hook et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 , 1998 ) . this project was aimed to find radio - loud quasars at @xmath5 , using candidate objects at similar flux densities as those in the gb / first sample , but over a larger area . at the time of writing ,",
    "only 5 radio - selected quasars at @xmath5 are available in the literature .",
    "these are given in table [ litgt4 ] , including the newly discovered objects described in this paper .",
    "in addition to these radio - loud quasars , radio galaxies have also been discovered at high redshift .",
    "these are selected on their ultra - steep radio spectrum . at this moment , five radio galaxies are known at @xmath5 ( e.g. van breugel 2000 ) .",
    "the class survey is a large - scale survey primarily to search for gravitational lenses among flat - spectrum radio sources ( myers et al . , 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "it consists of about @xmath16 flat spectrum sources , selected primarily from the 87 gb 5 ghz , wenss 325 mhz , and greenbank 1400 mhz radio surveys ( gregory & condon 1991 ; rengelink et al .",
    "1997 ; condon & broderick 1986 ) .",
    "recently a complete subsample of 11,685 objects was defined on the more accurate gb6 5 ghz ( gregory et al . 1996 ) and nvss 1.4 ghz ( condon et al . 1998 ) surveys . in the selection procedure ,",
    "the 1.4 ghz flux density of a gb6 radio source is defined as all the nvss flux within 70@xmath17 of the gb6 position .",
    "the complete sample has the following selection criteria :    * declination , @xmath18 , and + galactic latitude , @xmath19 .",
    "* @xmath20 , with @xmath21 . * @xmath22 mjy    at the time of the selection of the targets for our spectroscopy observations , 10170 objects ( @xmath23 ) of this complete sample had been observed with the vla in a configuration at 8.4 ghz , yielding a resolution of 025 ( fwhm ) and a position accuracy of @xmath24 .",
    "the remaining @xmath25 objects , were not yet observed due to gaps in the sky - coverage of the nvss at that time . these may therefore be considered to be sources with random radio properties .    about 10% of the observed targets",
    "were not detected at a @xmath26 mjy level . about 30% of those are certainly missed because they are lobes of larger sources , which are resolved out due to the lack of short baselines of the vla in a configuration .",
    "another 10% have been missed due to instrumental problems .",
    "why the remaining sources have not been detected is not yet clear , but extended or complicated structure may play a role .",
    "hence , we believe that most of these objects have large angular sizes and are unlikely to be located at high redshift .",
    "we therefore assume that these undetected sources will not influence the results and conclusions of this project .",
    "since only one night of spectroscopy time was available for this project , with only a limited part of the sky accessible , the sample was reduced to objects located at north galactic latitudes , @xmath27 . in this way the area of sky overlaps with that scanned by the apm ( see below ) . furthermore , since all the observed radio - loud quasars at @xmath5 have radio - spectral indices clearly flatter than @xmath28 , the spectral index cut - off was increased to @xmath29 ( removing 30% of the sources ) . in this way , the contamination of possible ` low ' redshift galaxies , which are more biased towards steepish spectra ( snellen et al .",
    "2001 ) , is reduced .",
    "this resulted in a sample of 3202 candidate objects , selected on their radio properties only , over an effective area of @xmath30 deg@xmath4 .",
    "optical identification of the resulting sample was carried out using the output catalogue of the apm scans of the palomar sky survey ( poss - i ) photographic plates in the @xmath10 ( red ) and @xmath31 ( blue ) passbands ( mcmahon & irwin 1991 ) .",
    "the optical radio correlation was done in a similar way as for the jodrell bank - vla astrometric survey ( jvas ) , as described in detail by snellen et al .",
    "the 3202 sources in the sample were correlated with the apm catalogue and were considered to have a candidate optical identification if the optical to radio position offset was found to be less than @xmath32 . in this way , 2030 sources ( @xmath33 ) were found to have an optical identification .",
    "note that the true percentage of class sources with optical identifications is slightly higher than this due to limitations of the apm catalog , e.g. fragmentation of large galaxies , halos of bright stars , and blending of objects such that the centroid of the merged objects is displaced by a few arcseconds ( see e.g. snellen et al .",
    "note however , that these problems will mainly occur for nearby galaxies and bright stars , which will not affect point source identification statistics of radio sources .",
    "candidate high redshift quasars were selected using the colour selection method ( hook et al . 1995 ) , which is based on the assumption that objects at high redshift appear redder than those at low redshift due to intervening ly@xmath34 absorption systems shifted into the blue passband .",
    "hook et al .",
    "( 1996 ) selected high redshift quasar candidates from the jvas survey with star - like identifications , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 colour @xmath37 .",
    "however , 303 objects in the sample fulfill these selection criteria , too many for our limited observing time .",
    "furthermore , the expected success - rate for finding @xmath5 quasars using these criteria , is only @xmath38 ( hook et al .",
    "for this project we were only interested in the quasars at @xmath5 , so we sharpened the selection criteria to increase the success - rate and decrease the number of candidates .",
    "the five previously published radio - selected quasars , have @xmath39 ( see table [ litgt4 ] .",
    "we therefore increased the colour - cutoff from @xmath40 to @xmath2 .",
    "although this meant that our sample is incomplete for @xmath41 , no effect is expected for quasars at @xmath5 the main contribution of candidates which turn out not to be high redshift quasars comes from galaxies at moderate @xmath42 distances , which the apm can not distinguish from point sources .",
    "the apm morphological classification is particularly crude towards its magnitude limit .",
    "we therefore lowered the magnitude limit for our candidate sample from @xmath35 to @xmath1 .",
    "the more stringent selection criteria in optical magnitude and colour , decreased the number of objects in the target sample from 303 to 40 .",
    "the ipac / caltech extragalactic database ( ned ) was searched for redshifts of the 40 potential target sources .",
    "seven sources turned out to have measured redshifts , of which three galaxies ( j1149 + 2958 , z=0.158 , gregg et al .",

    "in addition , the apm , poss - i , and where available , the poss - ii data of the targets , were carefully examined by eye for anomalies or possible extendedness . of the remaining 33 objects , a further 13 were rejected in this way ; j1324 + 3417 , j1609 + 4717 , j1625 + 2017 , j1648 + 5039 , j1710 + 5028 , j0845 + 4239 , j0900 + 1357 , j0951 + 3451 , j1012 + 1619 , j1151 + 6654 , j1259 + 4129 , j1605 + 3029 , and j1632 + 0419 . hence , 27 objects satisfied our selection criteria , of which 20 sources were previously unobserved .",

    "<S> we report on the search for distant radio - loud quasars in the cosmic lens all sky survey ( class ) of flat spectrum radio sources with @xmath0 mjy . </S>",
    "<S> unresolved optical counterparts were selected from apm scans of poss - i plates , with @xmath1 and red @xmath2 colours , in an effective area of @xmath3 deg@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> four sources were found to be quasars with @xmath5 , of which one was previously known . </S>",
    "<S> this sample bridges the gap between the strong radio surveys with @xmath6 mjy and the samples of radio - weak quasars that can be generated via radio observations of optically selected quasars . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , 4 new quasars at @xmath7 have been found . </S>",
    "<S> the selection criteria result in a success - rate of @xmath81:7 for radio - loud quasars at @xmath5 , which is a significant improvement over previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> this search yields a surface density of 1 per 1600 deg@xmath4 , which is about a factor of @xmath815 lower than that found in a similar search for radio - quiet quasars at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the study presented here is strongly biased against quasars beyond @xmath9 , since the @xmath10-passband of the poss - i only samples the spectra shortward of 1200@xmath11 at these redshifts . </S>"
