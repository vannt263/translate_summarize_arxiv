    "capillarity is a well known physical phenomenon directly related to the free energy present at the interface liquid - air .",
    "whenever the liquid gets in touch with a solid capillary , the motion of the air - liquid interface meniscus takes place , according to the wettability of the capillary wall .",
    "the force responsible for such motion is just the so - called surface tension .",
    "laplace and young were among the first to study the surface tension and capillarity , at the beginning of the nineteenth century .",
    "in particular , their work started from the awareness that the static pressure on the liquid side of a liquid - air interface is reduced by the effect of the surface tension .",
    "some time later , hagen and poiseuille , studying the flow of viscous liquids in circular pipes ( and capillary tubes in particular ) , derived the well - known poiseuille flow profile for a , fully developed , newtonian fluid .",
    "then , reynolds tested experimentally the stability of the poiseuille profile , finding that it is valid in the case of laminar flow .    dating from the early twentieth century ,",
    "the first ones to set up a model for the dynamics of liquid flow into a capillary , were bell and cameron @xcite , lucas @xcite , washburn @xcite and rideal @xcite .",
    "the well - known washburn solution was derived from these works .",
    "washburn solution was found by considering that the motion of a liquid penetrating a capillary is determined by a balance among capillarity , gravitational , and viscous forces under the assumption of a poiseuille profile as the velocity profile .",
    "for sufficiently large time , washburn solution describes excellently the dynamics of capillary flow and this is also proved by experimental results .",
    "moreover , a further validation of washburn solution has been given by both simulations of molecular dynamics , see for instance martic et al .",
    "@xcite , and the lattice - boltzman statistical - mechanical description , mainly used by physicists , see chibbaro @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , washburn solution is defective in describing the initial transient , because the model neglects the inertial effects . on the contrary ,",
    "those inertial effects were considered in a model proposed by bosanquet @xcite .",
    "the snc ( szekely , neumann and chang ) model , introduced by szekely et al .",
    "@xcite , takes into account the outside flow effects including an apparent mass parameter within the inertial terms .",
    "recently , many experimental and theoretical studies on liquids flowing under capillary action have pointed out the limitations of washburn solution and its validity only as an asymptotic approximation . for example , liquids flowing in thin tubes were considered by fisher and lark @xcite .",

    "@xcite in order to get a well - posed problem , see @xcite .",
    "this coefficient is necessary to make the differential model adequate also for the very steep changes in @xmath9 and its derivative at the very beginning of the dynamics .",
    "the contact angle @xmath0 is defined as the angle defined by the tangent to the meniscus at the point of contact with the capillary wall and the wall itself . in the case of a closed - end capillary the entrapped gas action",

    "for the validity of our one - dimensional analysis we must assume that the fluid has a quasi - steady poiseuille velocity profile .",

    "this implies the assumption of no heat exchange during the liquid penetration . under this assumption",
    ", we can use the adiabatic equation of a gas expressed by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the pressure , @xmath22 is the gas volume , and @xmath23 is the well known gas constant ( @xmath24 for bi - atomic gases ) represented by the ratio between the specific heat at constant pressure and the specific heat at constant volume . in order to deduce the value for the constant",
    ", we can assume that @xmath25 is the pressure at time @xmath26 when the volume occupied by the gas is equal to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the cross sectional area of the capillary .",
    "as a result , we have that the constant is equal to @xmath29 and the adiabatic equation becomes @xmath30 the entrapped gas action can be taken into account by adding to the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : model ] ) the pressure that this gas applies to the penetrant liquid meniscus , that is @xmath31 it is evident that the model by deutsch is a specific case of the adiabatic model obtained by fixing @xmath32 , that is about the value for dry air .",
    "let us consider here equation ( [ eq : pe3 ] ) , and remark that the entrapped gas pressure @xmath33 verifies the initial condition @xmath34 , the asymptotic condition @xmath35 and the limit condition @xmath36 corresponding to the common intuition that no action is expected if the capillary is not closed and that the internal pressure will increase if we let @xmath2 increase for a closed capillary .    in the study of capillary dynamics , it is of primary interest to work out the stationary level reached by the fluid inside the capillary .",

    "depending on the values used for the geometrical parameteres @xmath3 and @xmath7 , by keeping fixed all the other parameters affecting the dynamics , we have also observed the occurrence of oscillatory damped solutions .",
    "the possibility to obtain this kind of solution was pointed out also by zhmud et al . @xcite . in particular , it was numerically observed that such solutions oscillate just around the stationary level reached by the liquid interface and that , keeping fixed all the parameters , it always exists a threshold for the radius fixed the total length and viceversa , so that , the dinamics passes from an oscillatory under - damped behaviour to an over - damped one , or the other way round . a sample of this behavior for @xmath32 and for water inside a cylindrical capillary , with @xmath53 m and @xmath54 m , is shown in figure [ fig : oscill ] .",

    "we have found , numerically , the existence of a threshold for the occurrence of an oscillatory behaviour .",
    "moreover , the recent existing literature @xcite on the derivation of an analytical solution of capillary rise unfortunately deals with a model subjected to gravity but not taking into account the presence of an entrapped gas . for this reason",
    ", it is our opinion that an analytical study for the present problem taking into account the presence of an entrapped gas migth be of great interest .",
    "this topic was already partially faced in @xcite . by setting the apparent mass coefficient @xmath55 , the complete model , including the action of the entrapped gas ( [ eq : pe3 ] ) , with @xmath32 , can be rewritten as follows @xmath56 with the initial conditions @xmath57 , the new parameters @xmath58      for the sake of calculation and numerical simplification , it is worth rescaling the problem by introducing the generic scaling group @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 to be determined by replacing the original variables in ( [ eq : closed - end - expanded ] ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", we get @xmath62 as we have the forcing term that is @xmath63 , we are somehow forced to make this exponent appear also in the last term on the left hand side and in the second one on the right hand side of the equation .",
    "this is just obtained by solving the linear system @xmath64 that , once solved , provides the solution @xmath65 so that ( [ eq : scaling ] ) becomes @xmath66 in such a way we get the scaled form for ( [ eq : closed - end - expanded ] ) @xmath67+r^{-1}\\displaystyle{\\frac{d^2v}{ds^2}}=r^{-1}a - r^{-1}2bv\\displaystyle{\\frac{dv}{ds}}-\\displaystyle{\\frac{pr^{4/3}v}{l - r^{4/3}v } } \\ , \\ ] ] subject to the initial conditions @xmath68 . at this point ,",
    "on the left hand side of ( [ eq : closed - end - expanded - scaled ] ) we have the first term that is proportional to @xmath69 , whereas the one on the right hand side relative to the action of the entrapped gas , as long as the penetration is far from filling the capillary , is proportional to @xmath70 , and the remaining three terms are proportional to @xmath71 .",
    "making tend @xmath7 to zero it is clear that the dominant terms are just the ones proportional to @xmath71 .",
    "hence , by ignoring the terms not proportional to @xmath71 , the leading equation for ( [ eq : closed - end - expanded - scaled ] ) results @xmath72 that integrated once , due the given initial conditions , becomes @xmath73 equation ( [ eq : leading ] ) belongs to the class of riccati equation and is well posed .",
    "furthermore , as for very small @xmath74 , being zero the function @xmath75 in the origin , the second term on the right hand side of ( [ eq : leading ] ) can be ignored so as in the very beginning of its evolution , the solution can be approximated as follows @xmath76 by indicating the numerical solution as @xmath77 , obtained for the same parameters of water already used in figure [ fig : oscill ] , and defining the function @xmath78 as well , in figure [ fig : errpar ] it can be appreciated how in the very beginning of its dynamics the solution can be assimilated to a parabola within a very high degree of precision .",
    "moreover , it turns out also that the more is the capillary radius , the longer is the time interval of validity of the above deduction .",
    "[ br][br][1][-90]@xmath79   versus @xmath74.,title=\"fig : \" ]    on the contrary , as @xmath75 is increasing , after some time it becomes so high that we are allowed to ignore the left hand side of ( [ eq : leading ] ) so as the solution can be given by @xmath80 analogously to what done above , by defining the function @xmath81 , in figure [ fig : errwash ] it can be observed how after a given time where , as seen above there is a parabolic trend , unless the solution has reached the steady state ( this happens for @xmath82 ) , there is a time interval widening as the capillary radius lowers where washburn solution represents an excellent approximation .",

    ", we will understand how to estimate analytically the threshold value for the capillary radius or the capillary length about which some oscillations starts showing up around the steady state level @xmath37 , or alternatively the motion tends , without any oscillation , asymptotically to @xmath37 . by imposing the zero discriminant condition on the characteristic polynomial associated to ( [ eq : linear ] ) , an equation in two variables , namely , the capillary radius and length can be easily worked out , provided that we keep on maintaining constant all the remaining parameters .",
    "such a condition is just represented by the following equation @xmath91 which after some algebraic manipulations , and by recalling the functional dependence of @xmath37 in ( [ eq : zsul ] ) , can be rewritten as the polynomial of seventh degree in @xmath7 and third degree in @xmath3 @xmath92 by regarding ( [ eq : transequation ] ) as a two variables function @xmath7 and @xmath3 , its zero level defines a curve on the @xmath93 plane reported in figure ( [ fig : o - nono ] ) .",

    "the trajectories for a set of radius values , including the ones just said , are shown : on the top frame the unscaled function @xmath95 and on the bottom frame the scaled function @xmath96 , respectively .",

    "the corresponding parameters are @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 so that for them it comes out a theoretical threshold @xmath102 in a very agreement with the numerical one .",
    "finally , it is worth adding that the same results on the derivation of the analytical threshold have also been obtained by means of a stability analysis through the study of the jacobian of the vector field around the critical point represented by the steady state level on the phase plane @xmath103 . in this case",
    "it has been confirmed that @xmath103 is a stable point but just for the same threshold value found above it changes its nature from a simple node to a spiral node .",
    "before drawing the conclusions for our study it is worth mentioning how our model ( [ eq : model])-([eq : pe3 ] ) can be made adimensional .",
    "there are two main reasons that make an adimensional model important . as a first reason",
    ", the number of independent paramaters is reduced .",
    "the so - called pi - theorem tells us that for each characteristic dimension a reduction of one variable is possible . a second , and possibly more important",

    "each parameter represent a particular aspect of the problem .",
    "if its value is around unity , then that particular aspect is important .",
    "but , on the contrary , if its value is extreme , i.e. close to zero , or very large then that particular aspect can be treated in an asymptotic sense .    as far as our model ( [ eq : model])-([eq",

    "a reynolds number @xmath113 lower than 2300 indicates the physical condition for laminar flow .",
    "moreover , it would be also possible to introduce other two adimensional fluidynamics paremeters : the bond and the weber numbers .",
    "the lower is the bond number @xmath114 , the less is the deformation induced by the gravitational acceleration on the spherical shape of the meniscus interface due to the surface tension , in a horizontal cylinder .",
    "a low weber number @xmath115 means that the inertia of fluid is negligible with respect to its surface tension .",
    "afther a deeper study we have found that our analysis is better undertaken within the dimensional model . for instance , the scaling analysis presented in the previous section can not be carried on for the adimensional model because a value of @xmath7 appearing on the first two terms on the right - hand side of our model is replaced by the reynolds number .",
    "moreover , all dimensional parameters of different penetrant liquids can be taken from tables available in the literature , as for instance in the recent survey by kornev and neimark @xcite or in fazio et al .",
    "@xcite , whereas in order to correlate a real liquid to the adimensional model we need to find out a characteristic mean velocity u and this is not available within the relevant literature .",
    "the dynamical behaviour of a liquid inside a capillary entrapping a gas represents a very challenging phenomenon , from a modelling , an analytical , and a numerical viewpoint . in this paper",
    "it has been proved how the specific features of the liquid as well as of the capillary dimensions and the entrapped gas affect the dynamics of capillary rise in terms of time , depth , velocity of penetration , and type of dynamical regime ( oscillatory or non - oscillatory ) .",
