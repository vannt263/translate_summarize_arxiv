    "the _ kepler _ mission has now discovered some @xmath11250 very good exoplanet candidates via planetary transits of the parent star ( borucki et al .  2011 ) .",
    "the transit depths range from a few percent for giant gas planets to @xmath5 for smaller planets that are of the size of the earth . the distribution of orbital periods for these systems is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : porb_dist ] .",
    "the bulk of the systems have periods between @xmath13 and 30 days . as observations continue to be accumulated and analyzed",
    ", the newly discovered candidates will tend to be longer period systems ; the short - period end of the period distribution will change relatively slowly .",
    "there are relatively few systems with periods below a few days , and furthermore , most of the systems shown in fig.[fig : porb_dist ] with orbital periods less than a day are either now considered to be false positives ( i.e. , they are most likely associated with background blended binaries ) or have not yet been followed up in the detail required for conclusive categorization ( borucki et al .",
    "2011 ) . the confirmed short - period planets , most of which were not discovered by _ kepler _",
    ", have orbital periods between 0.73 and 1.09 days .",
    "these orbital periods are indicated by dual arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : porb_dist ] .",
    "the shortest planetary orbital period that has been reported is 17.8 hours ( winn et al .  2011 ) .",
    "hours , was reported ( muirhead et al .",
    "the planet 55 cnc e , the innermost of 5 planets revolving around 55 cnc , was discovered with ground - based optical doppler measurements ( fischer et al .",
    "2008 ; dawson & fabrycky 2010 ) and detected in transit by extensive satellite observations with the _ most _ satellite ( winn et al .",
    "winn et al .  ( 2011 ) estimate its mass and radius to be @xmath1@xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "planet orbits considerably shorter than a day are , in principle , quite possible , and their detection via transits using _ kepler _ should not be problematic in a signal - to - noise sense .",
    "there are at least two reasons , however , why such close - in , short - period planets have not been heretofore emphasized .",
    "first , there are many short - period stellar binaries that , when their light is highly diluted by another star within a few arc seconds ( e.g. , the target star under observation by _ kepler _ ) , are hard to distinguish from stars with transiting planets .",
    "second , giant planets are expected to be destroyed by roche lobe overflow if they are heated too strongly by their parent stars ( batygin , stevenson , & bodenheimer 2011 ) .    with _ kepler _",
    "data , the orbital period @xmath8 of a planet about a star can be measured .",
    "if the orbit is circular , and the planet has a mass @xmath9 much less than the mass of the parent star , then the size of its roche lobe can be determined without knowing the mass of the parent star : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mass and radius of jupiter , respectively .",
    "therefore , even if the planet does not evaporate because of the strong stellar radiation field , by the time a jupiter - mass planet migrates to an orbit with @xmath13 9 hours , it will start to empty its envelope via roche - lobe overflow .    in this work",
    "we discuss the signature of a planet in a 15.685-hour orbit about a k star .",
    "the object came to our attention via periodic occultations of the target star kic 12557548 .",
    "the term `` occultation '' is perhaps more appropriate than `` transit '' ( although we will use both terms interchangeably in this paper ) , because of the fact that the depths of the events are highly time dependent .",
    "as we discuss in this work , the occultations are periodic to 1 part in @xmath14 or more , and therefore must be due to the presence of an orbiting companion .",
    "however , the variation of the eclipse depths rules out transits by a single opaque body .",
    "more likely , we argue , the occultations are due to a stream of dust particles resulting from the slow disintegration of the planet .    in  [ sec : lc][sec : omm ] of this work we describe detailed analyses of the _ kepler _ observations of kic 12557548 from quarters q2 through q6 . in these sections",
    "we present light curves as well as power density spectra of the light curves .",
    "we also present an optical spectrum which basically confirms the spectral properties of kic 12557548 given in the kepler input catalog ( kic ) . in ",
    "[ sec : interpret ] we outline three explanations for the variable occultation depths , including grazing transits due to a pair of planets ; an eclipsing binary , possibly containing an accretion disk , that orbits kic 12557548 in a hierarchical triple configuration ; or , more likely , obscuration by a stream of debris from a disintegrating planet .",
    "we explore in  [ sec : dust ] the hypothesis of an occulting dust cloud in some depth .",
    "in particular , we discuss how dust can be stripped off a planet with substantial gravity .",
    "we go on to compute the approximate shape of a dust stream that has left the planet and is shaped by radiation pressure .",
    "our findings are summarized in  [ sec : summary ] ; there we also suggest future observations that may robustly establish the nature of the variable occultation depths .",
    "the occultations of kic 12557548 were discovered as part of a systematic search through the _ kepler _ data base for eclipsing binaries that are not in the prsa et al .",
    "( 2011 ) catalog .",
    "we used publicly available quarter 2 ( `` q2 '' ) data from each of the @xmath1150,000 _ kepler _ targets to carry out a general fourier transform search for periodicities ( kotson et al .",
    "2012 ) . the criteria for declaring a particular power density spectrum ( pds ) as `` interesting ''",
    "are that ( i ) there is at least one peak with amplitude greater than 5 standard deviations above the local mean of the spectrum , and ( ii ) there is at least one harmonic or subharmonic of the largest peak that is at least 3 standard deviations above the local mean .    in all",
    ", we find that @xmath14800 power spectra contain interesting content , as defined above . of these ,",
    "approximately 1800 are binaries that are already in the prsa et al .",
    "( 2011 ) catalog , as well as some 300 binaries , mostly of the contact variety , that appear to have not made it into that catalog ( kotson et al .",
    "most of the remaining ffts of interest involve stars that exhibit pulsations of one sort or another .",
    "0.3 cm 0.6 cm 0.3 cm    one of the interesting power spectra contains a peak at 15.6854 hours and 15 harmonics thereof with amplitudes that decrease slowly with frequency .",
    "this is indicative of a sharp transit / eclipse / occultation which occupies only a small fraction of a cycle .",
    "the target , kic 12557548 , does not appear in either the prsa et al.(2011 ) binary star catalog or the borucki et al .",
    "( 2011 ) planet catalog .",
    "light curves for kic 12557548 are shown in fig.[fig : lcs ] .",
    "the plots shown in this figure were made by combining the raw ( sap@xmath15flux ) long - cadence light curves from quarters 2 through 6 ( q2q6 ) ; before this was done the light curves from the various different quarters were multiplied by relative scale factors chosen to minimize any differences in intensity across quarter boundaries .",
    "low frequency variations caused by instrumental , and possibly intrinsic source , variations were then removed by convolving the flux data with a boxcar of duration 0.65356 days ( 15.5854 hours ) and then subtracting the convolved flux curve from the pre - convolution light curve .",
    "this processing should largely preserve the actual source behavior on orbital and suborbital timescales .",
    "fig.[fig : lcs ] shows the highly variable nature of the occultations which , in fact , have depths that render them easily seen over most of the 460 day interval , but for the first @xmath122 days of q2 are very small or even not noticeable .",
    "we have also checked the q1 data and , indeed , the occultations are not apparent during the first 10 days as well as the final 10 days of that quarter . as seen in panel ( c ) of fig.[fig : lcs ] , the individual occultations vary strongly from one cycle to the next .",
    "the variable occultations persist , with a similar range in depths , throughout the following 438 days of q2 through q6 data .",
    "when the data are folded about the 15.685-hour period , the results , shown in fig.[fig : folds ] , further illustrate how the occultation depths vary .",
    "the largest depth is @xmath11.3% , while some of the points near the middle of the occultation are depressed by no more than @xmath10.15% . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that , aside from a few individual data points within the occultation interval , almost _ all _ show a minimum depression in the intensity by @xmath16% .",
    "thus , even when the occultations are not noticeable , there still may be a small effect .",
    "when the folded data are binned ( see fig.[fig : folds]b ) one can see that the average depth at the heart of the occultation is only @xmath10.6% or about half the maximum depth .",
    "there is evidence ( at the @xmath15-@xmath17 level ) for a small peak in the flux of amplitude @xmath1@xmath18 at phases up to @xmath1@xmath19 before the occultation ingress .",
    "there is a also a very significant depression or deficit in the expected flux over a similar range of phases just after egress .",
    "we will discuss these features briefly in section ",
    "[ sec : scatt ] .",
    "the full width of the occultation , with the exception of these small features , is 0.1 of the orbital cycle .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath11.5 hours in duration , or just 3 _ kepler _ long - cadence integration times . if this duration is interpreted simply as indicating the sum of the radii of the occulting `` bodies '' it corresponds to ( @xmath20 .",
    "however , if we take into account approximately the effect of the finite integration time , then ( @xmath21 .",
    "note that these estimates assume , without justification , equatorial as opposed to grazing occultations .",
    "we have fitted a constant plus a cosine with a period of 15.685 hr and a cosine of half that period to the folded light curve , excluding points inside the occultation interval ( i.e. , at orbital phases of @xmath22 cycles around mid occultation ) , in order to search for possible ellipsoidal light variations .",
    "we find only an upper limit of @xmath1@xmath23 for the amplitude of such features .",
    "this limit will be discussed below in the context of setting a constraint on the mass of any body orbiting the target k star .",
    "finally , we find the epoch of mid - occultation in order to project ahead to future observations : @xmath24 where the numbers in parentheses are the respective uncertainties in the last significant figure given .      as a check for periodic modulations of the occultation depths for the 15.685-hour period , we carried out an fft of the q2 plus q3 data but with the portions of the light curve away from the occultation set equal to the mean out - of - occultation intensity .",
    "the purpose of this latter step is to suppress the noise level , without sacrificing any significant fraction of the signal .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : fft ] .",
    "all 16 harmonics of the 15.865-hour period , out to the nyquist limit , are clearly visible .",
    "in addition , a careful inspection of the amplitudes between the harmonics indicates some evidence for low - amplitude modulation - induced sidebands .",
    "however , at least a number of these can be reproduced in an fft of the window function associated with the occultations .",
    "thus , we find no compelling evidence for periodic modulation of the occultation depths .      because of the unusual exoplanet phenomenon presented in this work , we need to be especially careful to ensure that there are no spurious artifacts in the _ kepler _ data for this object . in this regard , we performed a number of tests on the data .",
    "first , as mentioned above , we checked that the occultations are present in all of the quarters of released ( i.e. , public ) data ( q1q6 ) , and that the behavior of the occultations does not change abruptly across quarterly boundaries .",
    "second , we investigated whether the photometric variations of kic 12557548 could be from another star or source on the sky .",
    "we examined the digitized sky survey images and found that there are no especially bright stars close to kic 12557548 whose light or transferred charge might introduce spurious signals into the data stream ( i.e. , none with v @xmath25 13 within @xmath26 and none with v @xmath27 10 within @xmath28 ) .",
    "an examination of a _ kepler _ full frame image for q1 indicates that there are no obvious stars within @xmath1@xmath29 ( @xmath110 pixels ) .",
    "the kepler input catalog does list two @xmath30=19 stars located @xmath31 and @xmath32 from kic 12557548 ( approximately 3.5 and 4.25 pixels ) , but these could not be the source of the photometric variations for two reasons .",
    "( i ) we checked difference images for each of q1q6 and the apparent source of the photometric variations is coincident with the stellar image of kic 12557548 ( batalha et al .",
    "difference images compare the in - transit frames with out - of - transit frames in the neighborhood of each transit and these are averaged across all events in each quarter .",
    "( ii ) analysis of the correlation of the astrometry ( brightness weighted centroids ) with the photometric signature of the occultations indicates that the position of kic 12557548 shifts by no more than @xmath10.2 millipixels in either row or column during any quarter .",
    "this indicates that there is no other background source that is producing the occultations and that is offset by @xmath12@xmath33 or more from kic 12557548 , given the depth of the events and the brightness of kic 12557548 ( jenkins et al .",
    "2010 ) .    as a further check against video crosstalk from the adjacent ccd readout channels , we examined areas on the sky located at the same row / column position on these adjacent channels , and found no stars within @xmath34 of the row / column position of kic 12557548 .",
    "the fact that the video crosstalk coefficients vary by typically 50% or more from quarter to quarter as the stars are rotated about the focal plane , and can be either negative or positive , and the fact that the photometric signatures of the occultations are consistent from quarter to quarter , provide additional confidence that it is highly unlikely that the photometric variations are due to a source on an adjacent ccd readout channel .",
    "third , there are no binaries in the prsa et al .",
    "( 2011 ) catalog or planets in the borucki et al .",
    "( 2001 ) catalog with periods that match that of kic 12557548 .",
    "kic 12557548 is a @xmath116th magnitude star located at ra(j2000 ) @xmath35 and dec(j2000 ) @xmath36 .",
    "we were able to obtain an optical spectrum of it on 2011 december 16 using the observatoire astronomique du mont - mgantic s 1.6-m telescope .",
    "four 15-minute exposures were taken through 1.4 to 1.7 air masses soon after astronomical twilight .",
    "the spectrometer utilized the sta0520 blue ccd and a 600-line / mm grating , yielding an effective spectral resolution of 4.3  .",
    "the four spectra were background subtracted , corrected for the quantum efficiency of the detector and the reflectance of the grating , corrected for rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere , and co - added to produce the spectrum shown in fig.[fig : omm ] .",
    "we did not carry out absolute flux calibrations since the purpose of this observation was simply to confirm the spectral class of the _ kepler _ target and to check for any unexpected spectral features .    despite the relatively low signal to noise ratio of this spectrum , taken under non - ideal conditions",
    ", we can clearly see the signatures of a mid - k star .",
    "comparisons with standard stars ( see , e.g. , jacoby , hunter , & christian 1984 ) indicate a spectral type of @xmath1k4v .",
    "furthermore , we find that the equivalent width of the na i line is @xmath37  which is indicative of a k5-k7 star ( jaschek & jaschek 1987 ) . from this range of spectral types we infer @xmath38 k , a mass of @xmath39 , and a radius of @xmath40 , assuming that the star is close to the zams .",
    "these are all quite consistent with the values listed in the kic .",
    "the kic lists magnitudes of g=16.7 , r=15.6 , i=15.3 , and z= 15.1 for star 12557548 . from this",
    "we estimate the v magnitude is 16.2 ( windhorst et al.1991 ) .",
    "if we take the absolute visual magnitude of the k star to be + 7.6 ( with @xmath41 ) , and correct for an estimated @xmath42 , this puts the object at a distance of about 470 pc .",
    "the data analysis presented for kic 12557548 in the previous sections reveals a highly periodic set of occultations , likely of the 16th magnitude k - star target of this particular _ kepler _ field .",
    "these occultations are highly variable in depth , and are therefore very different from anything yet reported about the other couple of thousand transiting exoplanets ( including candidates ) .",
    "the remarkable stability of the occultation period strongly suggests that the occultations are due to an orbital companion to kic 12557548 . in  [ sec : constrain ] , we constrain the separation and mass of such a companion .",
    "these constraints are quite independent of any particular model .",
    "we then outline more specific scenarios to explain the variable nature of the occultations .",
    "these are : ( 1 ) direct occultations by one planet , modulated by a second planet that causes a precession of the orbital plane of the occulting planet (  [ sec : dual ] ) , and ( 2 ) dust that emanates from a single disintegrating planet (  [ sec : disintegrate ] ) .",
    "we consider both ideas qualitatively here , and then in  [ sec : dust ] we elaborate on the more likely one : that the occultations are due to dust emitted directly from a planetary atmosphere . in ",
    "[ sec : triple ] , we discuss the alternative possibility that the occultations are not of the k star , but are rather due to a low - mass eclipsing stellar binary , possibly containing an accretion disk .      the regions of the light curve folded at the 15.685-hour period that are away from the occultations show no evidence  with a limiting amplitude of @xmath15 parts in @xmath14for ellipsoidal light variations ( elvs ) with periodicities of 15.685 hr or half that .",
    "since the amplitudes of elvs are of order @xmath43 ( where the subscript @xmath44 refers to the parent star ) we can set a limit on the mass of the companion @xmath9 ( assumed @xmath45 ) if we have an estimate of the companion s orbital semimajor axis @xmath46 .",
    "using the parameters for kic 12557548 taken from the kic , as well as our spectrum ( see  [ sec : omm ] ) , we find @xmath0 k , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "these properties all point strongly toward a mid - k star of mass @xmath49 . the semimajor axis of a small body in an assumed @xmath50-hour orbit about such a star is @xmath51    we then have a rather good estimate of @xmath52 of 0.23 .",
    "when this value and our upper limit on the elv amplitude are used in the above expression for the elv amplitude , we obtain a constraint on the mass of the orbiting companion of @xmath53 thus , it is unlikely that the parent star has another star , or even a brown dwarf , orbiting it at a distance of only 2.8 @xmath54 .",
    "hr , and two essentially equal eclipses per orbit , the limit on the mass of the companion would be @xmath111 @xmath11 ( for @xmath55 ) .",
    "] this leaves only planetary - mass companions as the direct or indirect cause of the occultations .      from our analysis in  [ sec : constrain ] , a planet similar to jupiter in mass and radius could be compatible with the lack of elvs .",
    "such a giant planet would also generate maximum eclipse depths of @xmath11% , like those observed .",
    "the challenge lies in having such a jovian - mass planet produce highly variable transit depths .",
    "we could try to make such a model work by supposing that the transit is grazing , and that precession of the orbital plane alters the transit geometry so that the eclipse depth varies .",
    "however , orbital precession induced either by tidal distortions or by another planet in an independent orbit generally occurs over timescales much longer than the orbital period .",
    "by contrast , the eclipse depths of kic 12557548 vary markedly from orbit to orbit . moreover , invoking a second planet in an attempt to force rapid orbit - to - orbit variations in the planet s trajectory across the star would result in transit timing variations ( ttvs ; agol et al .",
    "2005 ; holman & murray 2005 ) .",
    "no ttvs are observed , although the long - cadence _ kepler _ integration time hinders us from detecting ttvs substantially shorter than @xmath130 minutes .",
    "in addition , the peculiar ingress - egress asymmetry  in particular the pre - ingress brightening  evinced in the _ kepler _ light curve ( figure [ fig : folds ] ) finds no ready explanation under the dual planet hypothesis .    another way to induce precession would be to have a second planet orbit the first in a binary planet configuration ( podsialowski et al .",
    "however , we have verified , using the dynamical stability criteria of mikkola ( 2008 , and references therein ) , that for the parameters of kic 12557548 , two jupiter - sized planets can not be in a stable mutual orbit and avoid roche lobe overflow .      here",
    "we consider another scenario  that the occultations are produced by a much smaller , rocky planet , heated to such high temperatures that it is vaporizing . in evaporating away",
    ", it produces a debris field of dust that variably obscures up to @xmath11% of the light from the parent k star .",
    "a purely gaseous wind emitted by a planet will not have sufficient broadband opacity to affect significantly the transit depth in the _ kepler _ bandpass .",
    "for example , the hot jupiter hd 209458b is known to emit a gaseous wind ( vidal - madjar et al .  2003 ; ben - jaffel 2008 ; linsky et al .",
    "although this wind increases substantially the optical depth in narrow atomic absorption lines , it hardly alters the transit depth in the broadband optical . for kic 12557548",
    ", we must consider instead that the planetary outflow contains particulates , e.g. , dust .",
    "such dust would be driven off a rocky planet so hot that it is vaporizing .",
    "this scenario is further developed and quantified in ",
    "[ sec : dust ] .",
    "could the source of the occultations be a low - mass eclipsing stellar binary that either is coincidentally located close on the sky to kic 12557548 ( but see the limits we have placed on blends in ",
    "[ sec : valid ] ) or orbits kic 12557548 in a hierarchical triple system ?",
    "such a binary might consist of , e.g. , a pair of m stars , whose strongly modulated light would be diluted by light from the k star seen in kic 12557548 .",
    "if such a binary had an orbital period about the k star of @xmath5610 days , it could avoid producing a detectable elv in the light curve of the parent star .",
    "but we know of no mechanism by which an eclipsing stellar binary like this , whether it is or is not in a hierarchical triple , can generate variable transit depths ( e.g. , orbital precession is too slow ) , let alone reproduce the transit profile shown in figure 3 with its distinctive pre - ingress brightening and prolonged ingress .",
    "another possibility is that one component of the low - mass eclipsing stellar binary is a compact object , e.g. , a white dwarf , fed by an accretion disk ( g. marcy , personal communication ) .",
    "light from the binary , made variable by occultations of the accretion disk by the donor star , would be diluted by light from the k star . to explain the variable transit depths ,",
    "the accretion disk itself would have to vary in luminosity .",
    "why such luminosity variations would be restricted to those phases when the disk is occulted  i.e .",
    ", why they would not also occur during the @xmath170% of the orbital cycle when the light curve is essentially flat  is not explained under this hypothesis .",
    "in this section we examine in some detail how dust emanating from a possibly rocky planet might result in variable occultations of the parent star of up to 1.3% in depth .",
    "we discuss the size of the required dust cloud , composition and survival requirements for the dust particles , and required mass loss rates and implied lifetime of the planet against evaporation (   [ sec : superearth ] , [ sec : dustcomp ] , [ sec : taumdot ] ) .",
    "a mechanism of ejecting gas and dust from a planet with non - negligible gravity is described in  [ sec : eject ] .",
    "we argue that dust can provide a natural explanation for the time variability of the mass loss and thereby of the variable occultation depths (  [ sec : limit ] ) .",
    "we carry out a numerical simulation of the motions of dust particles after they escape from the planet s gravitational well that shows that a comet - like tail is formed , and that illustrates how the dust might scatter radiation as well as absorb it (   [ sec : dustflow ] , [ sec : scatt ] ) .",
    "we go on to discuss how long such a close planetary system could last under the influence of tidal drag on the orbit (  [ sec : tidal ] ) .",
    "finally , we explain why occultations by dust have not been heretofore seen in other close - in , hot , rocky planets (  [ sec : difference ] ) .",
    "a number of these sections are necessarily speculative or involve some assumptions .",
    "we offer these simply to start the thinking process on this subject rather than to provide definitive answers .      to set the stage , we assume in what follows that the planet underlying the outflow ( hereafter `` kic 1255b '' ) has an earth - like composition , and has mass @xmath57 ( 1.8 times the mass of mercury ) and radius @xmath58 .",
    "in the absence of an outflow , our nominal `` super - mercury '' would produce a transit depth of at most @xmath59 , consistent with our lack of detections of transits in portions of the light curve .",
    "the planet s hill sphere radius ( distance from the planet to the nearest lagrange point ) is @xmath60 the hill sphere radius is smaller than @xmath61 , defined as the characteristic size of the occulting region during the deepest eclipses ( i.e. , the size of the dust cloud ) .",
    "we adopt a nominal value for @xmath62 , which is such that if the occulting region were circular and optically thick , it would generate a transit depth of 1% , near the maximum observed . from our experiments ( not shown ) simulating the occultation profile , we estimate that @xmath61 could be a few times larger than our nominal choice if the occulting region were optically thin and/or the transit were not equatorial .",
    "we have chosen a mercury - like planet for our fiducial case because a low escape velocity allows us to explain how dust might be ejected .",
    "the physics of how grains can be launched successfully from a super - mercury is explained in  [ sec : eject ] .",
    "in contrast , the difficulties of ejecting dust from hot rocky super - earths are discussed in ",
    "[ sec : difference ] .",
    "dayside planet temperatures peak at approximately @xmath63 neglecting , among other effects , transport of heat from the substellar point by the atmosphere or by a magma ocean ( see lger et al .",
    "2011 for an estimate of the location of the shore of the magma ocean for the hot super - earth corot-7b ) .",
    "such nominal temperatures are hot enough to vaporize silicates and a variety of solid oxides , and to form a high - z atmosphere .",
    "this particular model requires that the atmosphere contain refractory grains which can survive for long enough to produce an observable occultation .",
    "we can think of at least two ways of loading the atmosphere with dust .",
    "the first is by condensation of dust grains from a metal - rich vapor into clouds akin to those in brown dwarf or giant planet atmospheres ; see , e.g. , the modeling of forsterite clouds in cooper et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and madhusudhan et al .",
    "condensation can occur where gas cools , at altitude or near the day - night terminator ( schaefer & fegley 2009 ; schaefer et al .",
    "2011 ; castan & menou 2011 ) .",
    "whether such clouds can contain enough condensed mass remains to be seen  we will see in  [ sec : taumdot ] and  [ sec : eject ] that the planetary wind must contain at least as much mass in gas as in solids ( or liquid droplets ) .",
    "a second way to inject dust into the atmosphere is through explosive volcanism .",
    "tidal locking of hot rocky planets may produce a pattern of mantle convection in which volcanism is focused near the substellar point , where a thermal wind (  [ sec : eject ] ) is best able to entrain volcanic ash ( gelman , elkins - tanton , & seager  2011 ; van summeren , conrad , & gaidos  2011 ) .",

    "whatever gas is ejected from the planet will be photoionized by the stellar radiation field and , like the gas tails of comets , interact with the magnetized stellar wind . to the extent that dust can be entrained in plasma along the planet s magnetotail , plasma instabilities may introduce further time variability .",

    "this upper limit exists because if the flow became too optically thick , light from the star would not reach the planet s surface to heat it .",
    "thus the mass loss rate may be self - limiting in a way that keeps the outflow from becoming too optically thick .",
    "one can imagine a limit cycle which alternates between a low - obscuration phase during which starlight strikes the planet s surface directly and dust proceeds to load the planet s atmosphere , and a high - obscuration phase during which dust removal dominates production .",
    "wind mass loss rates should depend on outgassing rates from the planetary surface .",

    "2009 ) would be welcome .",
    "once dust escapes from the planet , and the gas density becomes too low to exert significant drag , the dust will be swept back into a comet - like tail by the combination of radiation pressure and coriolis forces .",
    "the ratio of the stellar radiation pressure force on a grain to that of _ stellar _ gravity equals @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the radiation pressure efficiency factor ( see , e.g. , burns et al .  1979 ) and",

    "we performed a simple calculation of what a dust tail might look like . since the precise details of how dust",
    "is launched from the surface are presently unclear  they are subject , e.g. , to horizontal winds on the planet that can distribute material from the substellar point to the nightside  the calculation simply assumes a spherically symmetric outflow of dust from the planet at the surface escape speed .",
    "our fiducial planet parameters of @xmath150 and @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and a sublimation time for the dust of @xmath153 s were assumed .",
    "the computations were performed in a frame of reference rotating with the planet s orbit , and followed 30,000 dust particles from launch to sublimation .",
    "the results of this simulation are shown in fig.[fig : dust ] .",
    "a long dust tail is apparent because the color scaling covers a large dynamic range of column densities .",
    "the effective length of the tail is not actually that long , e.g. , the column density of dust particles is quite small at distances comparable to @xmath154 .",
    "this was quantified by integrating the total number of dust grains within @xmath155 1/8 of the stellar radius in height ( @xmath156 ) as a function of distance along the dust tail ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[fig : profile ] . given",
    "the presently available information , only relative values of the optical depth can be shown , but the curve serves to show that the projected density of dust grains falls off sharply with distance from the planet .",
    "thus , the optical depth could be somewhat greater than unity near the projected planet disk , and the net obscuration of the parent star could take on values up to the maximum level of @xmath11.3% that is observed .    in summary , the dust stream geometry seems able to accommodate the occultation durations and depths .",
    "it might even be able to explain the curious ingress - egress asymmetry in the occultation profile , as we argue in the next section .",
    "the putative dust cloud likely attenuates more by scattering photons out of our line of sight than by actual absorption ( this is due to the small imaginary part of the index of refraction in the visible ; see , e.g. , denevi et al .",
    "this opens the possibility that scattering of starlight into the line of sight would produce , at certain orbital phases , an _ excess _ of light above the nominal out - of - occultation region levels .",
    "an excess would be more likely given the presence of larger ( @xmath158 m ) grains that scatter primarily in the forward direction .",
    "we can estimate the ratio of fluxes scattered into , versus out of , our line of sight .",
    "consider an idealized , small , spherical scattering cloud of radius @xmath159 that scatters a fraction @xmath160 ( for `` albedo '' ) of all the stellar radiation incident upon it ( i.e. , the cloud presents a total scattering cross section of @xmath161 ) .",
    "the incident radiation is scattered uniformly into a solid angle @xmath162 centered about the direction of the incident beam . in the case that the cloud sits directly in front of the target star ,",
    "the ratio of fluxes scattered into , versus out of , the line of sight is @xmath163 independent of @xmath160 and @xmath159 .",
    "the ratio ranges from @xmath11.6% for isotropic scattering , to as high as @xmath120% for forward scattering into 1 steradian . if the dust cloud is blocking the stellar disk , then attenuation is dominant ( except in the case of extreme forward scattering ) .",
    "however , if the dust cloud is not blocking the stellar disk , then there may be a small excess contribution to the system light .",
    "this may explain the small bump in flux just before ingress , and the small depression in the flux just after egress ( see fig.[fig : folds ] ) . in this interpretation , the ingress - egress asymmetry results from the asymmetric distribution of dust in the planetary outflow .",
    "just prior to ingress , light is forward - scattered off the dusty head of the `` comet '' into our line of sight , producing the small bump in flux .",
    "light may continue to be forward scattered into the line of sight during the main occultation and even after egress .",
    "however , at those phases when part of the tail occults the star , the scattering of starlight out of the line of sight is likely to dominate and produce a net depression in the observed intensity .",
    "we now consider how long such a planet as the one we are proposing might last in the face of tidal decay due to interactions with the parent star .",
    "the timescale of tidal decay is approximately @xmath164 ( see , e.g. , gu , lin , & bodenheimer 2003 ) where @xmath165 is the usual dimensionless measure of dissipation in the parent star , and we have assumed that the parent star is rotating with an angular frequency much lower than the planet s orbital frequency , and that the orbital eccentricity is zero .",
    "thus , even for a pessimistically small value of @xmath165 , the lifetime against tidal decay is more than adequately long .",

    "there is still another reason why dust clouds are especially observable for kic 12557548 and not in the other observed systems . even if dust grains could be driven off the hot super - earths detected to date , they would be too hot ; grains in these other systems would sublimate too quickly to travel far from their parent planets , and would fail to block as much light from their host stars . if we use equation ( [ eqn : teff ] ) to estimate the temperature of a grain at the location of each super - earth , we find :    * kepler-10b : 3000 k * 55 cnc e : 2800 k * corot-7b : 2500 k * kic 1255b : 2100 k    thus kic 1255b  orbiting the coolest star  is distinguished in having the coolest grains .",

    "time variability of the outflow s dust density as reflected in time variability of the occultation depths could be caused by any number of factors : irregularities and uneven outgassing rates on the planet s possibly volcanic surface ; a feedback loop between mass loss and the stellar radiation flux received at the planet s surface that causes both to fluctuate with time ; and instabilities resulting from the interaction of the ionized planetary wind with the magnetized stellar wind . the analogy between our evaporating super - mercury and comets may not be a bad one , but much theoretical work remains to be done to put this scenario on a more quantitative and secure footing .",
    "obviously , short - cadence observations with _ kepler _ would be helpful in clarifying the issue of whether there are shape changes in individual occultations vs.  only changes in the overall depths .",
    "some shape changes would be expected , as the timescale for the wind to `` refresh '' is given by the grain travel time @xmath192 hr ( equation [ eqn : t_travel ] ) , which is not much longer than the eclipse duration of 1.5 hr .",
    "the target star , at @xmath193 = 15.7 magnitudes , is not very bright , but each 1-minute sample with _",
    "would yield @xmath194% counting statistics .",
    "given that the depths of the deepest occultations are 1.3% , this would provide a signal - to - noise of 8:1 for individual samples .",
    "the ingress and egress should be resolved in short - cadence data and the shapes should give important clues as to the nature of the system .",
    "observations with a large optical / infrared telescope , either from the ground or from space , would also prove helpful .",
    "measurement of the wavelength dependence of the occultation depth could confirm our hypothesis that sub - micron - sized dust is responsible .",
    "the detection of solid - state absorption features ( e.g. , the 10 @xmath64 m silicate band ) would also clinch the case for dust .",
    "deep imaging would have the added benefit of further ruling out blends with faint , variable interlopers .    searching for extra in - transit absorption by metals ",
    "photoionized mg , o , si , ca , and fe  through observations of spectral lines could lead to a direct demonstration that the underlying planet is comprised largely of heavy elements , and is evaporating ( cf .",
    "linsky et al .  2010 ) .",
    "our rough calculations indicate that in some lines ( e.g. , the mg ii 2800   doublet ) , the gaseous outflow may be so optically thick that its occulting size is limited only by the confining pressure of the incident stellar wind .",
    "we estimate the corresponding maximum flux decrement in any spectral lines to be on the order of @xmath15% .",
    "if there indeed turns out to be a super - mercury orbiting kic 12557548 , where the occultations are due to dust carried by outflowing sublimated gas , the planet would be among the smallest - mass bodies ever to have been ( indirectly ) detected .",
    "it would be the first extrasolar planet shown to be geologically active and to be disintegrating via the loss of high - z material .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for an encouraging and incisive report that motivated us to consider volcanic activity and to examine more quantitatively the ability of the atmosphere to entrain solids ; raymond jeanloz and michael manga for instructive exchanges about vaporizing silicates and volcano ejecta speeds ; josh carter for discussions about data validations and the viability of a dynamically stable binary planet ; ruth murray - clay for input about thermal winds ; robert szabo for information about properties of rr lyrae stars ; and bryce croll , dan fabrycky , ron gilliland , meredith hughes , john johnson , heather knutson , tim morton , margaret pan , erik petigura , and josh winn for stimulating discussions about follow - up observations .",
    "we consulted with ron remillard , rob simcoe , and adam burgasser about spectral classifications .",
    "we would also like to thank robert lamontagne and the staff at the observatoire astronomique du mont - mgantic for their assistance .",
    "ec is grateful for support from the national science foundation , and for useful and encouraging feedback from participants of the berkeley planet and star formation seminar , including ryan oleary and geoff marcy who shared their own analyses of the _ kepler _ data on kic 12557548 .",

    "<S> we report here on the discovery of stellar occultations , observed with _ kepler _ , that recur periodically at 15.685 hour intervals , but which vary in depth from a maximum of 1.3% to a minimum that can be less than 0.2% . </S>",
    "<S> the star that is apparently being occulted is kic 12557548 , a v = 16 magnitude k dwarf with @xmath0 k. the out - of - occultation behavior shows no evidence for ellipsoidal light variations , indicating that the mass of the orbiting object is less than @xmath1@xmath2 ( for an orbital period of 15.7 hr ) . </S>",
    "<S> because the eclipse depths are highly variable , they can not be due solely to transits of a single planet with a fixed size . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss but dismiss a scenario involving a binary giant planet whose mutual orbit plane precesses , bringing one of the planets into and out of a grazing transit . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario seems ruled out by the dynamical instability that would result from such a configuration . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly consider an eclipsing binary , possibly containing an accretion disk , that either orbits kic 12557548 in a hierarchical triple configuration or is nearby on the sky , but we find such a scenario inadequate to reproduce the observations . the much more likely explanation  </S>",
    "<S> but one which still requires more quantitative development  involves macroscopic particles escaping the atmosphere of a slowly disintegrating planet not much larger than mercury in size . </S>",
    "<S> the particles could take the form of micron - sized pyroxene or aluminum oxide dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> the planetary surface is hot enough to sublimate and create a high - z atmosphere ; this atmosphere may be loaded with dust via cloud condensation or explosive volcanism . </S>",
    "<S> atmospheric gas escapes the planet via a parker - type thermal wind , dragging dust grains with it . </S>",
    "<S> we infer a mass loss rate from the observations of order 1  @xmath3gyr , with a dust - to - gas ratio possibly of order unity . for our fiducial @xmath4 planet </S>",
    "<S> ( twice the mass of mercury ) , the evaporation timescale may be @xmath10.2 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> smaller mass planets are disfavored because they evaporate still more quickly , as are larger mass planets because they have surface gravities too strong to sustain outflows with the requisite mass - loss rates . </S>",
    "<S> the occultation profile evinces an ingress - egress asymmetry that could reflect a comet - like dust tail trailing the planet ; we present simulations of such a tail . </S>"
