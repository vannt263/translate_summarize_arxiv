    "i would like to talk about the virtual photon structures , especially about the general virtual photon structure functions and their positivity constraints .",
    "this work has been done in collaboration with ken sasaki and jacques soffer @xcite .",
    "the structure of the virtual photon can be studied from the double - tagged two - photon processes in @xmath1@xmath2 collisions ( fig.1 ) or the 2-jet events in resolved photon processes of @xmath3 collisions .",
    "the experimental data provide the effective photon structure functions , @xmath4 , where the indices @xmath5 and @xmath6 refer to the transverse and longitudinal photon , respectively .",
    "so far mostly studied are the unpolarized photon structure functions , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . here",
    "i refer to the recent review articles on virtual photon structure functions , m. krawczyk s talk at photon 2000 @xcite , and m. nisius s summary talk at photon 2001 @xcite .",
    "more recent and detailed reviews are those by m. klasen @xcite and by i. schienbein @xcite .    now in the last few years , there has been much theoretical interest in the photon s spin structure functions @xmath0 and @xmath9 .",
    "especially , @xmath0 has attracted much attention because of its relevance to the axial anomaly just like the case of nucleon spin structure function .",
    "namely we can write down the qcd prediction of the 1st moment of @xmath0 .",
    "these spin dependent photon structure functions can be studied from the polarized @xmath10 collider or more directly from the polarized @xmath11 collision .",
    "the virtual photon target provides a good place to study the structure of the operators appearing in the operator product expansion of the current product , since the virtual photon matrix elements of the operators are perturbatively calculable .",
    "now there are 8 independent structure functions for the virtual photon - photon scattering illustrated in fig.2 .",
    "this process is described by the structure tensor       @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the amplitude for @xmath14 given by @xmath15|0\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the electromagnetic current , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are four - momenta of the probe and target photon , respectively .    for the kinematical region @xmath19",
    "( @xmath20 : qcd scale parameter ) or @xmath21 we have the operator product expansion ( ope ) : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the spin-@xmath25 operator and its coefficient function , respectively .",
    "now we can decompose the structure tensor following budnev , chernyak and ginzburg @xcite as @xmath26 where @xmath27 s are the projectors given by @xcite @xmath28 with @xmath29\\nonumber\\\\ & & w = p\\cdot q , \\quad x=(p\\cdot q)^2-p^2q^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and satisfy @xmath30 where the subscripts @xmath5 and @xmath31 refer to the transverse and longitudinal photon , respectively .",
    "we now introduce the s - channel helicity amplitudes as follows : @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the photon polarization vector with helicity @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . from angular momentum conservation , parity conservation , and time reversal invariance @xcite",
    ", we have in total 8 independent helicity amplitudes , which we may take as @xmath36 the first 5 amplitudes are helicity - nonflip , while the last 3 amplitudes are helicity - flip .    here",
    "we note the relation between the 8 structure functions ( [ structurefn ] ) and the 8 helicity amplitudes ( [ helicityamp ] ) , which are given by @xmath37\\nonumber\\\\ & & w_{st}=w(0,1|0,1)\\nonumber\\\\ & & w_{ts}=w(1,0|1,0 ) , \\quad w_{ss}=w(0,0|0,0 ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & w_{tt}^a=\\frac{1}{2}\\left [ w(1,1|1,1)-w(1,-1|1,-1 ) \\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & w_{tt}^\\tau = w(1,1|-1,-1)\\nonumber\\\\ & & w_{ts}^\\tau=\\frac{1}{2}\\left [ w(1,1|0,0)-w(1,0|0,-1 ) \\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & w_{ts}^{\\tau a}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left [ w(1,1|0,0)+w(1,0|0,-1 ) \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the helicity - nonflip amplitudes are non - negative , the first four structure functions are postive - definite , while the last four are not",
    ". we also note that all structure functions are symmetric under intechange of @xmath38 except @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which satisfy @xmath41",
    "we now turn to the nlo qcd calculation of the virtual photon structure functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 . the basic theoretical framework for the nlo qcd calculation",
    "is either based on the ope supplemented by renormalization group ( rg ) or on the dglap type parton evolution equation .",
    "the master formula for the @xmath25-th moment for @xmath7 and @xmath0 has the same form , and for the @xmath0 case , we have for the kinematical region @xmath19 : @xmath44 \\label{master}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the renormalization scheme independent coefficients computed from the one- and two - loop anomalous dimensions together with one - loop coefficient functions .       @xmath49 is the qcd running coupling constant , and @xmath50 denote the eigenvalues of one - loop anomalous dimension matrix .",
    "we have shown @xmath43 in fig.3 , where the nlo @xmath0 corresponds to the solid line , for @xmath51 , @xmath52 gev@xmath53 and @xmath54 gev@xmath53 with @xmath55 gev .    for a real photon ( @xmath56 )",
    ", the 1st moment vanishes to all orders of @xmath49 in qcd @xcite : @xmath57 now the question is what about the @xmath58 moment of the virtual photon case .",
    "taking @xmath59 limit of ( [ master ] ) the first 3 terms vanish as @xmath60 denoting @xmath61 ( @xmath62 : the @xmath63-th quark charge , @xmath64 : the number of active flavors ) , we have @xmath65 here we note that the sum of the one - loop coefficient function @xmath66 and the finite photon matrix element of quark operator @xmath67 is renormalization - scheme independent and equal to @xmath68 for @xmath58 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath69 we can go a step further to @xmath70 qcd corrections which turn out to be @xcite @xmath71\\nonumber\\\\ & & + { \\cal o}(\\alpha_s^2).\\hspace{3 cm } \\label{virtual2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result coincides with the one obtained by narison , shore and veneziano in ref.@xcite , apart from the overall sign for the definition of @xmath0 .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to explain the transition from the vanishing sum rule ( [ real ] ) for the real photon to the non - vanishing result ( [ virtual1 ] ) or ( [ virtual2 ] ) for the virtual photon .",
    "application of the cauchy - schwarz inequality @xcite to the above photon helicity amplitudes leads to the following positivity bound @xcite : @xmath72 more explicitly , we obtain the following three positivity constraints : @xmath73 in terms of the structure functions ( [ structurefn ] ) , the positivity constraints read @xmath74    for the real photon target , @xmath56 , the number of independent structure functions or helicity amplitudes reduces to four , which are @xcite @xmath75 and we have only one positivity constraint ( [ realpositiv ] ) .    the virtual photon structure functions @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath0",
    "are related to @xmath76 s as @xmath77 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.7cm}f_2^\\gamma(x , q^2,p^2)=\\frac{2x}{{\\widetilde\\beta}^2 } \\left [     w_{tt}+w_{st}-\\frac{1}{2}w_{ss}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.\\hspace{4.8 cm } -\\frac{1}{2}w_{ts }   \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.7cm}f_l^\\gamma(x , q^2,p^2)={\\widetilde\\beta}^2f_2^\\gamma - xf_1^\\gamma ,   \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.7cm}g_1^\\gamma(x , q^2,p^2)=\\frac{2}{{\\widetilde\\beta}^2}\\left[w^a_{tt}- \\frac{(p^2q^2)^{1/2}}{w}w^{\\tau a}_{ts }       \\right ]   \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.7cm}g_2^\\gamma(x , q^2,p^2)=-\\frac{2}{{\\widetilde\\beta}^2}\\left[w^a_{tt}- \\frac{w}{(p^2q^2)^{1/2}}w^{\\tau a}_{ts }       \\right ]   \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.7cm}\\mbox{with}\\quad { \\widetilde\\beta}=\\left(1-\\frac{p^2q^2}{w^2}\\right)^{1/2 } \\mbox{and } \\ w = p\\cdot q.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath78 @xmath79    now let us see if the first positivity constriant ( [ realpositiv ] ) is satisfied in the pqcd results .",

    "5 we have plotted the nlo qcd result of @xmath83 $ ] and the lo result of @xmath84 as functions of @xmath85 for the case @xmath86 with the number of active flavors , @xmath51 .    we observe that the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) is satisfied for almost all the allowed @xmath85 region except near @xmath87 ( @xmath88 for @xmath86 ) .",
    "the reason of why the inequality is not satisfied near @xmath89 is as follows .",
    "we notice that the graph of @xmath90 falls rapidly as @xmath91 . in the qcd parton picture",
    ", this is due to the total momentum conservation of the partons inside the photon . from the large @xmath25 behavor of the structure functions @xmath92 and @xmath0 ,",
    "they vanish like @xmath93 as @xmath94 .",
    "the nlo qcd effects further suppress @xmath92 and @xmath0 at large @xmath85 . while , the lo qcd result of @xmath95 is just same as the massless quark parton model , where the power corrections of @xmath96 is neglected .",
    "hence @xmath84 in fig .",
    "5 increases as a function of @xmath85 like @xmath97 and violates the inequality in the vicinity of @xmath89 .",
    "the _ physical _",
    "@xmath95 should vanish as @xmath91 , which is realized in the case of parton model with massive quark .",
    "this implies the necessity of introducing the quark mass effects for the photon coefficient function .",
    "to summarize we have investigated the aspects of the structure functions of the virtual photon for the most general case .",
    "the virtual photon structure could be studied in future @xmath10 and @xmath11 colliders and provides a good testing ground for the structure of the current product .",
    "we have discussed the sum rule for the @xmath0 for the virtual photon target .",
    "it would be an intriguing question how we can understand the transition from vanishing 1st moment for real photon to non - vanishing one for virtual photon .",
    "for the eight independent structure functions of the virtual photon we have derived three positivity constraints and discussed if the first inequality is satisfied in the qcd parton model computation of @xmath92 , @xmath0 and @xmath95 . for another polarized structure function @xmath9 , the twist-3 effects are important , where we have to solve the mixing problem for the full qcd analysis @xcite .",
    "there remain a number of virtual photon structure functions yet to be studied .",
