    "altogether , we find    @xmath49    in practice , we find that the analysis of a single stacked spectrum does not constrain the redshift evolution in .",

    "we apply the methodology to 1800 quasar spectra drawn from the sdss - dr7 .",
    "we began with the vetted quasar list from our survey of lyman limit systems @xcite which avoids all purported quasars in the sdss - dr7 that have erroneous redshift estimates or are not bona - fide quasars .",

    "therefore , our estimates of  include opacity from the quasar s local galactic environment , i.e.  its proximity region .",
    "the sample was further limited to the following criteria : ( 1 ) @xmath55 to insure significant coverage of the lyman limit in the sdss spectra and minimize the likelihood that lls bias the quasar target probability ( but see below ) ; ( 2 ) s / n  @xmath56 at @xmath28 ; ( 3 ) @xmath57 to insure that a stack of 150 quasars covers a redshift interval @xmath58 .",
    "starting at @xmath59 , we constructed a series of bins of 150 quasars each to produce a stacked spectrum .",
    "each quasar spectrum was normalized by the observed flux at @xmath28  ( in a 20  window ) and shifted to its rest - frame ( nearest pixel ) .",
    "the full ensemble was then averaged ( without weighting ) ignoring bad pixels .",
    "a sample of three of the stacked spectra are given in figure  [ fig : stacks ] .",
    "as noted above , our analysis of  includes contributions from the quasar s proximity region . in general , this corresponds to @xmath60 or @xmath61(e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "from the stacked spectrum , figure  [ fig : stacks ] shows that the flux at the ` edge ' of the proximity region ( i.e.  at @xmath62 ) is @xmath63 times the flux at 912 , giving @xmath64 . in the absence of the igm beyond the proximity region ,",
    "the flux would begin to recover shortward of 900  as @xmath65 .",
    "it is evident , therefore , that opacity from the ` true ' igm dominates our analysis .",
    "furthermore , we find that our analysis yields models that extrapolate well to 912  suggesting the opacity of the proximity region follows the behavior of the general igm .",
    "this is consistent with our finding that there is no strong differences in the incidence of lls near quasars @xcite .    using the model for  ( equation  [ eqn : newteff ] ) ,",
    "we have fitted the data to evaluate the opacity  at @xmath54 in a series of redshift intervals , each containing 150 quasars .",
    "we minimized @xmath66 over rest - wavelength intervals starting at 905  ( to minimize bias from strong lyman series absorption in the proximity zone of the quasar ) and extending down in wavelength corresponding to the larger of 3900   and @xmath67 .",
    "the scatter in the stacked spectrum was estimated locally in 21  pixel bins centered at each data point and presumed to be gaussian .",
    "the flux at  was estimated from the data but allowed to vary by 10%  when minimizing @xmath66 . because the observed scatter in the stacked spectrum is systematic ( related to stochasticity in the igm ) and is not included in our model",
    ", one can not estimate @xmath68 the uncertainty in  from standard @xmath66 techniques .",
    "instead , we performed a bootstrap analysis of 100 realizations of each stacked spectrum and estimated @xmath68 from the resulting distribution of  values .",
    "figure  [ fig : mfp ] presents the evaluations of in terms of the mean free path ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the mean free path exhibits a peak ( minimum in opacity ) of nearly @xmath70 at @xmath1 and declines with increasing redshift .",
    "we have parameterized the redshift evolution in  with a simple linear regression : @xmath71 .",
    "restricting the analysis to @xmath72 , a @xmath66 minimization of this model to the binned evaluations of  gives @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "formally , our analysis also indicated a rise in the opacity at @xmath73 , i.e.  the lower limits in figure  [ fig : mfp ] .",
    "this runs contrary to all expectation and current understanding of the igm .",
    "initially , we suspected that this measurement indicated a systematic error in the sdss spectra at the bluest wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we examined the  colors of the quasars in the first ( @xmath74 ) and third ( @xmath27 ) quasar bins .",
    "figure  [ fig : ug ] histograms the two  distributions .",
    "the colors of the @xmath59 quasars are systematically _ redder _ than those at @xmath1 ; this is the exact opposite of what one predicts if the igm were monotonically increasing in opacity with redshift .",
    "we conclude that the quasars at @xmath59 drawn from the sdss are redder than the cohort at @xmath1 because of an elevated incidence of lyman limit opacity , confirmed by analysis on the incidence of lls @xcite .",
    "we then explored whether this elevated opacity is related to observational bias in the sdss quasar sample .",
    "we simulated the sdss experiment by constructing mock quasar spectra at @xmath74 and @xmath27 with intrinsic seds having mean  color of 0.57mag and standard deviation of 0.19mag .",
    "these spectra were blanketed with igm absorption assuming a monotonically increasing opacity with redshift .",
    "after restricting the quasar sample according to the sdss color - selection criteria @xcite , we found the @xmath74 cohort has systematically redder colors than the higher redshift sample .",
    "similarly , we find a correspondingly higher opacity inferred from the stacked spectrum . because of the targeting criteria , the cohort of @xmath75 quasars in the sdss spectroscopic database are systematically biased against having @xmath76 which biases against sightlines without strong lyman limit absorption .",
