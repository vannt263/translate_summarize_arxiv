    "<S> the results obtained in this way are practically indistinguishable from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : averagepathwave](c ) . to explain this robust deviation from the result by blanco  _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we thus have a more careful look on the weyl estimate which , in addition to the leading order term which we used above , also features a next - order correction proposed by weyl  @xcite , @xmath108 / \\!\\left(2 \\pi\\right)$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this correction involves not only the scattering area @xmath1 , but also the internal boundary of the scattering region @xmath109 which is notably different from the external boundary @xmath2 through which waves can scatter in and out . </S>",
    "<S> the internal boundary @xmath109 in case of our waveguide system under study is given by @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is given by the total circumference of the scatterers . </S>",
    "<S> the open boundary conditions along the external boundary @xmath2 were approximated with neumann boundary conditions , which contribute with the opposite sign as the dirichlet boundary conditions on the surface of the waveguide and of the scatterers . in systems with a small boundary - to - area ratio </S>",
    "<S> this next - order correction of the weyl law is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> since , however , the number of scatterers which we have placed inside the system ( from @xmath49 in the ballistic case , to @xmath84 in the chaotic case , to @xmath86 in the localized case ) increases this ratio , the additional boundary term in the weyl law may become important here . to check this explicity </S>",
    "<S> , we re - evaluate the expression for the average dwell time @xmath87 from above when adding this correction , leading us to @xmath112.\\ ] ] a comparison of this analytical formula with the numerical results , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : averagepathwave](c ) , yields excellent agreement and indicates that the observed deviation from the prediction by blanco _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _  stems from the comparatively large boundary of the many small scatterers which we placed inside the scattering region . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize at this point that this correction to the blanco estimate only contains the boundary values @xmath109 and @xmath2 as additional input and remains entirely independent of any quantities that characterize the scattering process itself , like @xmath3 or the localization length @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> this insight is of considerable importance , since it means that eq .   defines a new invariant quantity that is independent of the scattering regime we are in and thus accurately matches our numerical results for the average time in the ballistic , chaotic and localized limit . </S>",
    "<S> this invariant quantity for waves deviates from the prediction by blanco  _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite only through an additional term originating in the fact that waves feel the boundary of a scattering region already when being close to it on a scale comparable with the wave length . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that additional wave corrections to the result by blanco and fournier may arise when waves have access to a larger scattering area @xmath1 than classical particles through the process of tunneling .        in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have derived a universal invariance property for wave transport through disordered media . </S>",
    "<S> the invariance of the averaged path length or averaged time spent by a wave in an open finite medium has been established based on scattering theory . in the appropriate limit of diffusive and non - resonant media , </S>",
    "<S> the random - walk picture is recovered , and the result coincides with the expression of the averaged path - length initially established by blanco  _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our work confers to this invariance property a degree of universality that extends its implications far beyond applications of random - walk theory . </S>",
    "<S> this extension to waves opens up new possible applications in optics , acoustics , seismology , or radiofrequency technologies , where propagation in complex media is the subject of intense research  @xcite . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> in the context of wave transport through disordered media , most spatial or temporal observables scale with @xmath3 , and the invariance property derived in this work is particularly counterintuitive and rich in implications . </S>",
    "<S> it should find applications in imaging , communications , or light delivery , for instance to generate enhanced light - matter interaction within a certain volume by controlled light deposition , or to design specific structures to enhance light harvesting for solar cells  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consider here for example that the above invariance property allows us to estimate the time that waves need to transit through a given medium based on a measurement of only the reflected portion of incoming waves and an _ a priori _ knowledge of the sample geometry . particularly intriguing in our eyes </S>",
    "<S> is the possibility to get access , through eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , to the internal surface @xmath109 of scatterers embedded in a scattering medium through a time - resolved transport experiment . </S>",
    "<S> such an approach could go as far as to measure the fractal dimension of the scatterer surface by linking our results with the berry - weyl conjecture  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an extension of our findings to media with gain and loss  @xcite should also be of interest , both from a theoretical and an applied standpoint . </S>",
    "<S> our study should also be very relevant to the field of wave control , which has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for light manipulation and delivery in complex media  @xcite , showing for instance that suitably shaped wavefronts can deliver light at a specific time and position  @xcite . finally , let us point out that although we only studied here 3d slab and 2d waveguide geometries with uncorrelated disorder , the invariance property , thanks to its connection to the dos , is very general and should apply to a wide range of geometries and excitation strategies , as well as to non - uniform scattering properties , biological tissues , and correlated disorder , from partially ordered to entirely ordered system such as levy glasses or photonic crystals  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an experimental demonstration of the discussed invariance property should be within reach , in particular in optics where time - resolved techniques and sensitive detectors are available .    </S>",
