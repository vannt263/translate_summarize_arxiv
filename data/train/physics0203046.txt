    "<S> 0.5 cm in recent years , topology has established itself as an important part of the physicist s mathematical arsenal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the concepts of the topological particle and its current have been widely used in particle physics @xcite and topological defect theory @xcite . here , the topological particles are regarded as abstract particles , such as monopoles and the points defects .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we give a new understanding in topology and physics . </S>",
    "<S> many physics system can be described by employing the order parameters . by making use of the @xmath0-mapping theory </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the topological current constructed by the order parameters can possess different inner structure . </S>",
    "<S> the topological properties are basic properties for a physics system , so the difference in configuration of the topological current must correspond to the difference in physical structure .    considering a @xmath1-dimensional system with @xmath2-component vector order parameter field @xmath3 where @xmath4 correspond to local coordinates . the direction unit field of @xmath5 is defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 the topological current of this system is defined by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the surface area of @xmath10-dimensional unit sphere @xmath11 . </S>",

    "<S> then the total topological charge of the system is @xmath25 here @xmath26 is a @xmath2-dimensional spatial space for a given @xmath27 this is a topological invariant and corresponds to some basic conditions of this physical system . </S>",

    "<S> this change in configuration of the topological current must correspond to some change in physical structure .    </S>",
    "<S> all of the above discussion is based on the condition that @xmath28 when @xmath29 at some points @xmath30 at @xmath31 along the zero line @xmath16 , it is shown that there exist several crucial cases of branch process , which correspond to the topological particle generating or annihilating at limit points and splitting , encountering or merging at the bifurcation points </S>",

    "<S> all of these branch processes keep the total topological charge conserved , but it is very important that these branch processes change the number and the charge of the topological particles . i.e. change the inner structure of the topological current . in our point of view </S>",

    "<S> , we can obtain a topological current as @xmath69 in which @xmath70 is the trajectory of the @xmath22-th topological particle @xmath71 and @xmath72 from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) , it is easy to see that @xmath64 is single - valued on @xmath73 which states that hopf index @xmath74 @xmath75 here </S>",
    "<S> . it can be proved that the total charge of this system is just the euler number of @xmath67 which is @xmath76 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a topological invariant of @xmath67 which corresponds to the basic condition of this system : @xmath77 the following discussion can show that this topological invariant can possess different configuration when @xmath44 changes . </S>",
    "<S> this difference in topology corresponds to the change in adiabatic levels of this nonlinear system .    </S>",
    "<S> we can prove that every topological particle corresponds to an eigenstate of the nonlinear two - level system . by solving @xmath78 form ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we find there are two different cases for discussing .    </S>",
    "<S> case 1 . for @xmath79 there only two topological particles @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which locate on the line @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively as shown in the upper panel of fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> all of them with topological charge @xmath84 and @xmath85 for any @xmath86 correspondingly , in this case , there are only two adiabatic energy levels in this nonlinear two - level mode for various @xmath44 @xcite , as shown in the lower panel of fig.1 , @xmath80 corresponds to the upper level and @xmath87 corresponds to the lower level .    </S>",
    "<S> case 2 , for @xmath88 two more topological particles can appear when @xmath44 lies in a window @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary of the window can be obtained by assuming @xmath90 yielding @xmath91 the striking feature happens at @xmath92 there exists a critical point @xmath93 with @xmath94 as we have shown in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we can prove that this point is a limit point , and a pair of topological particles @xmath95 and @xmath96 generating with opposite charge @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively@xmath68 both of the new topological particles lie on the line @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> one of the original topological particle , @xmath87 with charge @xmath98 on the line @xmath99 moves smoothly up to @xmath100 where it collides with @xmath95 and annihilates with it at another limit point @xmath101 the other , @xmath102 which lies on the line @xmath82 , still moves safely with @xmath86    as pointed out by b. wu and q. niu @xcite , when the interaction is strong enough @xmath103 a loop appears at the tip of the lower adiabatic level when @xmath104 while @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> we show the interesting structure in fig . 2 in which @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath107 there are two adiabatic levels , the upper level corresponds to the topological particle @xmath80 , the lower one corresponds to the topological particle @xmath108 for @xmath109 , there are also only two adiabatical levels , but at this time the lower one corresponds to @xmath96 while the upper one still corresponds to @xmath110 the arc part of the loop on the tip of lower level when @xmath89 just corresponds to @xmath111 which merges with the level corresponding to @xmath96 at the point @xmath26 on the left and with the one corresponding to @xmath80 at the point @xmath112 on the right@xmath21    from the above discussion , one finds that when the structure of the topological current is changed by generating or annihilating a pair of topological particles ( the upper panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , at the same time , the physical structure is changed by adding two energy levels or subtracting two energy levels respectively ( the lower panel of fig.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the critical behaviors happen at the limit points where @xmath113 .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this nonlinear two - level model is of comprehensive interest for it associates with a wide range of concrete physical systems , e.g. , bec in an optical lattice@xcite or in a double - well potential@xcite , and the motion of small polarons@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so , the relation between topological particles and physical inner structure can be observed in experimental methods . </S>",
    "<S> here we propose a perspective system for observing the striking phenomenon : a bose - einstein condensate in a double - well potential@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes of general occupations @xmath114 and phases @xmath115 obey the nonlinear two - mode schrdinger equations , approximately@xcite , @xmath116 with @xmath117 , and total number of atoms @xmath118 , is conserved . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath119 are zero - point energy in each well , @xmath120 are proportional to the atomic self - interaction energy , and @xmath121 describes the amplitude of the tunnelling between the condensates . after introducing the new variables @xmath122 and @xmath123 , one also obtain an equations having the same form as eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) except for the parameters replaced by @xmath124/\\hbar , \\ ] ] @xmath125 with these explicit expressions , our theory and results can be directly applied to this system without intrinsic difficulty . in this system </S>",
    "<S> the topological particles can be located by the stable occupation and relative phase @xmath82 or @xmath83 for a give parameter @xmath86 and , one can draw the zero line of each topological particle by giving different @xmath126 we hope our discussions will stimulate the experimental works in the direction .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that for a system the global property ( topology ) is given , the interesting feature is that under the same topology the topological configuration can be different , this difference must correspond the different physical structure . </S>",
    "<S> this relation between topological configuration and physical structure gives an important property to classify some physical system which contains many different structures .    </S>",
