    "the standard model is verified to a great accuracy by recent experiments at lep .",
    "the symmetry breaking of the electroweak interaction is however less understood because its effect is insensitive to these low energy experiments .",
    "this is the consequence of veltman s screening theorem @xcite .",
    "next generation experiments at lhc are designed to probe the higgs sector .",
    "if the higgs boson is sufficiently heavy , the study of the longitudinal vector boson scattering can provide valuable informations on the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism of the standard model .",
    "the theoretical study of this process is a challenge to theoreticians because the standard perturbative field theoretical methods have to be modified due to the strong interaction of the heavy higgs sector .",
    "this problem is well - known and has recently been the focus of extensive studies in the litterature @xcite based on the equivalence theorem @xcite with the linear sigma model @xcite .    an equally interesting problem , but less well - known , is to consider the effect of a possible heavy fourth generation of fermions @xcite . the existence of heavy weak @xmath0 multiplets , sufficiently degenerate to satisfy the @xmath1 parameter constraint , is still consistent with experimental data .",
    "heavy fermions interact strongly because of large yukawa couplings and along with the higgs boson represent strongly interacting quanta of the symmetry breaking sector .",
    "this hypothesis will introduce another scale in the problem and physical amplitudes , even at low energy , does not obey the screening theorem , i.e. the higgs and fermion mass dependence of physical quantities is no longer logarithmic but rather power like .",
    "this result is related to hill s conjecture @xcite about the non - decoupling of heavy quanta when adding extra strong interactions in the higgs sector . in a previous preliminary study of the consequences of the existence of a fourth generation of fermions @xcite , it was found that the p - wave elastic scattering amplitude of the longitudinal @xmath2 bosons depends sensitively on the ratio of the higgs and fermion masses .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to make a more general and precise study of this question .",
    "our strategy is to calculate numerically the one - loop @xmath3 partial - wave amplitudes in all isospin channels .",
    "using the argand diagram analysis we show , from the violation of elastic unitarity , that the strong interaction physics sets in even with a higgs mass as low as 500 gev provided the 4th generation fermion mass is equal or larger than the higgs mass .",
    "we then make the hypothesis that the elastic unitarity condition at low energy , where inelasticity is negligible , is an important condition which must be satisfied by strong interactions .",
    "this leads us to unitarize the pertubative amplitudes by the pad approximant method @xcite .",
    "we also require that the unitarisation scheme should be consistent with analyticity or causality or , in other words , the presence of the landau ghosts due to the unitarisation scheme should not be accepted if they are too close to the low energy region .",
    "we study this landau ghost problem using the low energy expansion of the one loop amplitude and find that the solutions with the fourth generation fermion masses which are comparable or larger than the higgs mass , the landau ghosts in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels move too close to the physical region to be accepted .",
    "our main conclusion is that if the ratio of the higgs to the fermion mass is less or equal to unity , our requirement can not be satisfied with any known non perturbative methods .",
    "large values of the ratio of higgs to fermion mass are entirely acceptable .",
    "although we work with a heavy higgs assumption so that the equivalence theorem can be applied , which simplifies considerably our calculation , we suspect that this difficulty is also present in a scenario with a relatively light higgs of a few hundred gev but with heavier fermions .",
    "the real parts of the one - loop corrections to longitudinal vector boson scattering due to a heavy fourth generation of fermions have been calculated by dawson and valencia @xcite using the goldstone boson equivalence theorem @xcite and the on - mass - shell renormalization scheme .",
    "their calculation can be shown to be in agreement with a much earlier one by jhung and willey @xcite . for a numerical evaluation by the ff package @xcite",
    ", we find it convenient to express the complex @xmath3 scattering amplitudes in terms of the 4- , 3- and 2-point scalar loop integrals .",
    "when the fermions are degenerate , we need only to calculate the one - loop amplitude @xmath6 for the process @xmath7 .",
    "we get @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively the bosonic and fermionic contribution , read @xmath11 and the scalar loop integrals , denoted as @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , are defined by the standard expressions @xmath15 with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the scattering amplitudes @xmath19 of the isospin @xmath20 eigenstates are @xmath21 and the partial - wave amplitudes @xmath22 are defined by @xmath23 given these exact one - loop partial - wave amplitudes , one may try to estimate , as a function of the higgs mass @xmath24 and heavy fermion mass @xmath25 , the scale @xmath26 at which the standard model becomes strongly interacting in the higgs sector .",
    "violation of unitarity can be a useful guide to limit the region of validity of the one - loop calculation .",
    "for that purpose , we use the argand plots of partial - wave amplitudes to find out the degree of violation of elastic unitarity which can be ascribed to the omission of higher order terms in the pertubation series because this expansion only obeys unitarity order by order .",
    "let @xmath27 and @xmath28 be respectively the tree - level contribution and the one - loop corrections to the partial - wave amplitude @xmath22 .",
    "then one can quantify the size of unitarity violation @xcite by the vector @xmath29 of minimum length which can be added to @xmath30 , to bring the elastic scattering amplitude to the unitarity circle @xmath31 there is some arbitrariness in choosing a criterion for satisfactory convergence of the pertubative expansion .",
    "we impose @xmath32 the energy scales @xmath33 which violate this bound are gathered in table  [ scales ] for a representative set of higgs and fermion masses .",
    "argand plots for @xmath4 , @xmath34 channel are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "imposing other criteria such as @xmath35 , or @xmath36 , would lower the scales @xmath37 .",
    "there are no other assumptions than those which ensure the applicability of the equivalence theorem and the elastic unitarity condition , namely @xmath38 .",
    "is relaxed in isospin channels @xmath39 . ]",
    "the influence of the top quark with a mass smaller or equal to 200 gev has negligible effect on the @xmath3 scattering .",
    "the effect of multiple w production has recently been calculated in the heavy higgs limit @xcite and was shown to have negligible effect on the unitarity relation . in the region of energy of interest we can therefore safely ignore inelastic effects in the unitarity relation .",
    "one can read from table  [ scales ] that fermions induce strong interactions below 1 tev in the @xmath40 channel already for higgs and fermion masses between 0.5 gev and 1 gev , whereas in the absence of fermions , interactions become strong below 2 tev only when the higgs mass is greater or equal to 3 tev @xcite .",
    "in this section we want to study the @xmath3 scattering problem by resumming the one - loop calculation in order to make it satisfy the unitarity relation .",
    "this is necessary in order to extend the region of validity of the perturbation calculation as this method can handle strong interactions and/or resonance effects .",
    "the exact preservation of probability is utmost important to handle these problems .",
    "let us denote the @xmath41 partial wave projection of the perturbative amplitude by @xmath42 where the isospin and @xmath41 partial wave indices and the @xmath43 dependence are omitted .",
    "the corresponding tree and one loop amplitude are denoted respectively by @xmath44 and @xmath45 . the perturbative amplitude @xmath46 satisfies the perturbative unitarity relation , @xmath47 , which is to be compared with the exact elastic unitarity relation , @xmath48 , which must be valid in the energy region below the inelastic threshold .",
    "the one - loop perturbative series can be resummed by consructing the diagonal @xmath49 $ ] pad approximant : @xmath50 } = \\frac { f^{(0)}}{1 - f^{(1)}/f^{(0)}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which satisfies the elastic unitarity relation @xmath51 } = \\mid f^{[1,1 ] } \\mid^{2}$ ] .",
    "hence we can write @xmath52 } = e^{i\\delta}\\sin\\delta$ ] , where @xmath53 is the phase shift .",
    "if we add any real polynomial contribution to the denominator of eq  [ pade ] or any analytic function which is real on the unitarity cut , the elastic unitarity relation remains valid .",
    "hence the pad method can also be used to study the inelastic effect of the @xmath54 and @xmath55 intermediate states on the elastic scattering provided we limit ourself to the energy region below the inelastic threshold .    in fig .",
    "2 some typical phase shifts are plotted for higgs boson masses @xmath56 and 1.5  tev as a function of energy .",
    "because of our unitarisation method , for a higgs mass less than 3 tev , the higgs mass defined by the position where the @xmath40 phase shift passing through @xmath57 is the same as that defined by the vanishing of the real part of the inverse of the higgs propagator . for a higgs mass larger than 3 tev a lower energy resonance",
    "is generated with a phase shift passing through @xmath57 from below and is genuinely a bonafide resonance .",
    "the higgs mass that we defined and used in our perturbative calculation corresponds in fact to a @xmath40 phase shift passing through @xmath57 from above .",
    "for @xmath58 the @xmath5 s - wave phase shift also exhibits a resonance behavior but with the phase shift passing through @xmath59 .",
    "we show below it is associated with a landau ghost very close to the real energy axis and can not be accepted .",
    "it is generated by the unitarisation scheme in which the scattering length and the effective range , respectively the @xmath60 and @xmath61 terms , are both negative due the contribution of the fermion loop in this channel .",
    "the @xmath62 phase shift has a resonance behavior ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the position of the resonance is much lower than that given by technicolor models @xcite .",
    "furthermore the ksrf relation is not valid .",
    "our calculation shows that for small values of higgs mass , although the analytical results of @xcite are qualitatively correct , a substantial correction to the width of @xmath1 due to the contribution of the @xmath63 channel must be made .",
    "this is so because the @xmath1 width due to the @xmath3 states are so small that even the @xmath63 contribution becomes dominant .",
    "the unitarisation scheme does not always work because it may introduce unwanted singularities in the complex energy plane which give rise to a violation of causality .",
    "these landau type singularities can be got rid of by multiplying the scattering amplitude by an appropiate polynomial .",
    "this can be obviously done but at the expense of a violation of unitarity .",
    "if they were far from the physical region of interest , the resulting violation of unitarity would be small and could be blamed on our approximation scheme and therefore could be accepted .",
    "therefore we should examine carefully the unitarised amplitudes to see whether they have unwanted singularities which are too close to the physical region of interest .",
    "however our pad amplitude is computed numerically for real energy and is not suitable for analytic continuation to find complex singularities .",
    "a more exact calculation of the landau ghost resulting from our pad amplitude will be undertaken shortly and will be a subject for a future publication . in the meanwhile",
    "we can use the @xmath64 limit of the partial - wave amplitudes @xmath22 @xcite , which turns out to be valid for a wide range of energy , to find the landau ghost .",
    "the contribution of the fermion loop to these low - energy amplitudes can be summarized as follows @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a channel dependent algebraic factor and @xmath67 is the number of color or fermion species .",
    "we shall refer loosely to @xmath68 as the  effective number of fermions  in the @xmath69 channel . in the limit of the non linear sigma model ( nlsm)@xcite , @xmath70 , we have @xmath71 and these numbers are all positive and small . for finite @xmath72",
    "this is no longer the case and the effective numbers of fermions , which vary wildly with the mass ratio @xmath72 , can be large and negative .",
    "we find that : @xmath73 for @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 amplitudes respectively .",
    "these limits are a good approximation already when @xmath72 is of order unity or less . on the contrary",
    "the nlsm limit can only be reached when @xmath72 is much larger than unity .",
    "for example the value @xmath77 ( compared with the nlsm value of 1/3 ) is reached only when @xmath78 .",
    "the main problem with perturbation theory comes from the large effective negative number of fermions in the @xmath40 channel when @xmath79 .",
    "such a large negative number will inevitably introduce a landau ghost close to origin .",
    "this is an essential point . in table",
    "[ ghosts ] we give the position of the landau ghost as a function of fermion and higgs masses .",
    "the result from our calculation is very unsatisfactory : as can be seen from this table , for most values of @xmath72 , equal or less than unity , the landau ghost moves towards the origin along the negative s - axis . because our calculation should be a good low energy calculation , the presence of the low energy landau ghost is therefore not acceptable .",
    "the @xmath80 channel has a similar problem . for @xmath81",
    "the effective fermion number for this channel is also negative . for @xmath82 the landau ghost in this",
    "channel moves near the real positive s - axis .",
    "it gives rise to a  resonance  in this channel with a negative scattering length and negative effective range which is completely unphysical .",
    "it is not clear whether this undesirable solution is due to the pad scheme or to some thing more fundamental which is related to a negative effective fermion number .",
    "unlike the s - wave scattering , the p - wave channel @xmath62 has the effective fermion number positive for all value of @xmath72 . in this case",
    "there is no landau ghost present in our solution even with fermion and higgs values which give difficulties in the s - wave channel .    in summary",
    ", we find that the landau ghosts are far from the physical region of interest provided that the ratio @xmath83 .",
    "although we found satisfactory solutions for the @xmath62 channel even for @xmath84 or less , the s - wave solutions are very unsatisfactory .",
    "one could speculate that there could be some fundamental difficulties in a theory where fermion masses are larger or equal to the scalar masses or simply that we have not treated the channel @xmath85 in a satisfactory manner .",
    "we have made a detailed study of the strongly interacting higgs with or without the presence of the heavy fourth generation . without the fourth generation ,",
    "our conclusion is very much the same as given in the previous study @xcite : it is not possible to generate a p - wave resonnance in @xmath3 scattering with a mass less than 3 tev . a heavy higgs boson with a mass larger than 3",
    "tev would generate a lower mass higgs boson corresponding to the @xmath40 phase shift passing through @xmath57 from below which should be considered as as a genuine resonance .",
    "the input higgs boson mass corresponds to a phase shift passing through @xmath57 from larger values ( antiresonance ) .",
    "yet a consistent pertubative calculation must be done with the input parameter otherwise the chiral properties are spoiled .",
    "here there is a potential difficulty with the perturbative scheme .",
    "it is amusing to note that only in potential scattering theory one can prove that the rate of decrease of the phase shift through @xmath57 is related through causality to the range of interaction .",
    "the existence of an anti - resonance can not be excluded a priori .",
    "when the fourth generation is introduced , the problem becomes much more complicated due to the large effective number of fermions .",
    "for the ratio of higgs mass to fermion mass of the order of unity , the p - wave fermion number is positive and is enhanced by a factor of 8 , the @xmath40 is enhanced by a factor of 60 , the @xmath5 , @xmath34 is of the order of 2 and they are both negative . because of the p - wave enhancement factor , the expected mass is much lower than that obtained from the nlsm ; furthermore , because the tree @xmath62 amplitude decreases from the low energy theorem value as @xmath86 the p - wave resonance has a much narrower width .    in the @xmath40 channel , because of the enormous negative enhancement factor , the landau ghost is driven to the origin , which makes the resulting phase shift unacceptable .",
    "the same situation holds also for the @xmath5 , @xmath34 channel .",
    "here we have an even more difficult situation : when the fermion mass is larger or equal to the higgs mass , a resonance is generated in this channel corresponding to a landau ghost of the same mass , which is slightly off the real energy axis and on the physical sheet .",
    "unlike the usual result of the screening theorem of veltman , the presence of the heavy fermion gives rise to a strong dependence on the higgs mass or more precisely on the ratio of the higgs boson to the fourth family fermion masses .",
    "our main conclusion is that we can get a reasonable solution with heavy fermions of the order of less than 0.5 tev provided that the corresponding higgs boson is at least twice as heavy .",
    "we can also incorporate heavier fermion masses provided we take heavier higgs mass .",
