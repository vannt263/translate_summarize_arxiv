    "at present there is no any observational evidence for the existence of gravitomagnetic monopole or so - called nut charge which may be source of gravitomagnetic field in static case .",
    "however there are several attempts and proposals to detect it through astronomical observations in galactic , extragalactic range and in solar system .",
    "for example , the anomalous acceleration of pioneer satellites  @xcite is attempted to explain through the effect of gravitational field of _ magnetic mass _ on motion of test particles  @xcite . in recent papers",
    "@xcite , the theoretical effect of magnetic mass in nut space on the microlensing light curve and the possibility of magnetic mass detection using the gravitational microlensing technique have been studied .",

    "cylindrically symmetric stationary metrics are analyzed due to the fact that they can be used as simple first order approximation model for describing some astrophysical objects . here",
    "we will concentrate in studying properties of nut sources related to the cylindrical symmetry .",
    "the nut metric components generated by the solution to the newtonian laplacian equation corresponding to a newtonian potential of a rod of length @xmath5 and mass per unit length being equal to @xmath6 was presented in  @xcite . in the paper  @xcite the metric of cylindrical nut source in the approximation of weak field has been obtained and studied . in the paper",
    "@xcite we have shown the metric of nouri - zonoz describing spacetime outside a line gravitomagnetic field could be obtained from papapetrou solution of vacuum equations of gravitational field .    physical interpretation of nut solution was also investigated in the literature . in particular ,",
    "it was shown in recent paper  @xcite that the sources of the nut spacetime are two semi - infinite counter - rotating rods of negative masses and a finite static rod of positive mass .",
    "it was also noted that this model is the only possibility for the nut solution to be stationary and possess zero total angular momentum . although the metric is not , from the mathematical point of view , cylindrically symmetric , it is physically cylindrically symmetric , which is clear from the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields which are both explicitly cylindrically symmetric functions .    in our preceding paper  @xcite",
    "the electromagnetic fields of conducting shell embedded in the weak gravitational field of cylindrical gravitomagnetic monopole were investigated and analytical solutions to the maxwell equations in this spacetime were found . here",
    "we extend them to the space time of cylindrical nut source obtained in  @xcite as exact solution of einstein equations without making any assumption on the strength of gravitational field .",
    "we are interested to study the motion of test particles and electromagnetic fields in nut space with the aim to get tools for studying new important general relativistic effects which are associated with nondiagonal components of the metric tensor and have no newtonian analogues due to their origin .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ motion ]",
    "we study the motion of test particles in spacetime of cylindrical nut source .",
    "we investigate the effective potential and consider the influence of nut parameter on characteristics of particles motion . in section  [ meq ]",
    "we solve maxwell equations in the exterior metric of cylindrical nut source around ( i ) magnetized star with the dipolar magnetic field and ( ii ) electric charge put on cylindrical gravitomagnetic monopole .",

    "@xmath22 represent gravitoelectric ( total mass of the source ) and gravitomagnetic charges respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is also called nut parameter or the most commonly known as gravitomagnetic monopole. from astrophysical point of view it is reasonable to assume that the string has no electric charge and consequently in the space - time around the nonspinning nut string the metric tensor has the following nonvanishing components & & g_00=-f  , g_11=g_33=f^-1e^2  , + & & g_02=f  , g_22=f^-1 ^ 2-f^2  . the euler - lagrange equations [ e - l ] ( ) - = 0  , governing geodesics of the metric  ( [ gen_cylind ] ) can be derived from the lagrangian [ lagr ] 2l = g _  . where a dot stands for differentiation with respect to an affine parameter @xmath23 .    the integrals of motion [ e ] & = & = 0  ,  p_t =- e  , +   + [ l ] & = & = 0  ,  p_=l   follow from euler - lagrange equations  ( [ e - l ] ) .",

    "the lagrangian  ( [ lagr ] ) is [ lagr_nut ] l = -f^2 + f + f^-1e^2(^2 + ^2 ) + ( f^-1 ^ 2-f^2)^2  , and the corresponding canonical momenta  ( [ e][lagr_nut ] ) are [ momenta ] e = f ( - )  , l = f + ( f^-1 ^ 2-f^2 )  .",
    "our task here is complicated due to the fact that the metric coefficients depend not only on radial coordinate , but also on coordinate @xmath14 ( the spacetime is axially symmetric ) .",
    "we have to express @xmath14 through @xmath13 . in the paper",
    "@xcite the motion of a free uncharged test particle in the kerr - newman - taub - nut spacetime was considered . solving the hamilton - jacobi equation which describes the motion of test particle in the vicinity of non rotating source endowed with gravitomagnetic charge",
    "it was shown that the orbit will lie on a cone with [ cos ] =| |  . as @xmath28 such an orbit degenerates to a single orbit on the equatorial plane .",
    "using transformations  ( [ transform ] ) one can get the expression for @xmath14 in cylindrical coordinates [ z ] z=  .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath29 corresponds to the equatorial plane @xmath30 in spherical coordinates . in order to investigate the radial dependence of effective potential we restrict ourselves to the study of circular geodesics neglecting possible motion of particles along the @xmath14 axis , hence @xmath31",
    "this implies that the equation  ( [ lagr_nut ] ) is [ geod_circ ] -f^2 + 2f + f^-1e^2 ^ 2 + ( f^-1 ^ 2-f^2)^2=-m^2  . from equations  ( [ momenta ] ) one could have =  , =  .",

    "curves for particles with equal angular momentum and different gravitomagnetic charges have more monotonous behavior with the increase of the value of nut parameter.,title=\"fig:\",width=430,height=147 ]    to simplify further calculations we can make the assumptions concerning the value of @xmath46 .",
    "we select second order approximation in gravitomagnetic monopole moment which can be justified by the fact that at the moment there is no any astrophysical evidence for strong gravitomagnetic mass .",
    "for example , in the recent papers  @xcite the magnetic mass detection using the gravitational microlensing technique has been explored and it has been evaluated that the minimum observable gravitomagnetic mass to be about @xmath47 .",
    "the following assumption is made concerning energy @xmath39 and angular momentum @xmath48 of the particle .",

    "the orbit situated at an inflection point of the effective radial potential , that is , with [ sec_deriv_r ] v|_=_0=0 is the least tightly bound and describes the bounds of stability region.the solution of this equation for @xmath44 is @xmath65 .",

    "the orbits are stable for @xmath67 and unstable for @xmath68 .",
    "for @xmath69 we have for limit of stability @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the radius of critical orbit separating stable orbits from unstable for nonzero gravitomagnetic monopole increases .",
