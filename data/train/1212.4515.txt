    "it is also worth noting that poincar s result can be generalized .",
    "suppose , for example , that the functions @xmath12 are only piece - wise continuous in @xmath3 but are analytic in @xmath20 for each value of @xmath3 . then the solution will be piece - wise differentiable in @xmath3 .",

    "this work is necessary to get the lay of the land . for comparison , section 3 studies some of the properties of the truncated taylor maps @xmath57 obtained by solving the variational equations numerically .",
    "there we will witness the remarkable fact that a truncated taylor map approximation to @xmath0 can reproduce the infinite period - doubling feigenbaum cascade and associated strange attractor exhibited by the exact @xmath0 .",
    "truncation at order 3 already produces a map @xmath58 with the right qualitative behavior , and agreement with exact numerical results improves as @xmath59 is increased beyond @xmath60 .",
    "thus , in effect , we make a preliminary study of some convergence properties of truncated taylor approximations to the duffing equation stroboscopic map .",
    "a final section provides a concluding summary and discussion .",
    "as an example application , this section studies some aspects of the _ duffing _ equation [ 8 ] .",
    "the behavior of the driven duffing oscillator , like that of generic nonlinear systems , is enormously complicated .",
    "consequently , we will be able to touch only on some of the highlights of this fascinating problem .    duffing s equation describes the behavior of a periodically driven damped _ nonlinear _",
    "oscillator governed by the equation of motion @xmath61 here @xmath62 is an arbitrary phase factor that is often set to zero . for our purposes",
    "it is more convenient to set @xmath63 evidently any particular choice of @xmath62 simply results in a shift of the origin in time , and this shift has no physical consequence since the left side of ( 2.1 ) is independent of time .",
    "we assume @xmath64 , which is the case of a positive hard spring restoring force . and @xmath65 .",
    "] we make these assumptions because we want the duffing oscillator to behave like an ordinary harmonic oscillator when the amplitude is small , and we want the motion to be bounded away from infinity when the amplitude is large .",
    "then , by a suitable choice of time and length scales that introduces new variables @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the equation of motion can be brought to the form @xmath68 where now a dot denotes @xmath69 and we have made use of ( 2.2 ) . in this form",
    "it is evident that there are 3 free parameters : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "while the duffing equation is nonlinear , it does have the simplifying feature that the driving force is periodic with period @xmath73 let us convert ( 2.3 ) into a pair of first - order equations by making the definition @xmath74 with the result @xmath75 @xmath76 let @xmath77 denote initial conditions at @xmath78 , and let @xmath79 be the final conditions resulting from integrating the pair ( 2.6 ) one full period to the time @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath56 denote the transfer map that relates @xmath79 to @xmath77 . then , using the notation @xmath81 , we may write @xmath82    suppose we now integrate for a second full period to find @xmath83 . since the right side of ( 2.6 ) is periodic , the rules for integrating from @xmath80 to @xmath84 are the same as the rules for integrating from @xmath78 to @xmath80 . therefore we may write @xmath85 and in general @xmath86 we may regard the quantities @xmath87 as the result of viewing the motion in the light provided by a stroboscope that flashes at the times , the driving term described by the right side of ( 2.3 ) vanishes at the stroboscopic times @xmath88 . ] @xmath89 because of the periodicity of the right side of the equations of motion , the rule for sending @xmath87 to @xmath90 over the intervals between successive flashes is always the same , namely @xmath56 . for these reasons @xmath56 is called a _ stroboscopic map_. despite the explicit time dependence in the equations of motion , because of periodicity we have been able to describe the long - term motion by the repeated application of a single fixed map .",
    "one way to study a map and analyze its properties , in this case the duffing stroboscopic map , is to find its fixed points .",
    "when these fixed points are found , one can then display how they appear , move , and vanish as various parameters are varied .",
    "such a display is often called a _ feigenbaum _ diagram .",
    "this subsection will present selected feigenbaum diagrams , including an infinite period doubling cascade and its associated strange attractor , for the stroboscopic map obtained by high - accuracy numerical integration of the equations of motion ( 2.6 ) .",
    "they will be made by observing the behavior of fixed points as the driving frequency @xmath72 is varied . for simplicity , the damping parameter will be held constant at the value @xmath91 .",
    "various sample values will be used for the driving strength @xmath71 .",
    ", is varied while the others , including @xmath72 , are held fixed . ]",
    "let us begin with the case of small driving strength .",
    "when the driving strength is small , we know from energy considerations that the steady - state response will be small , and therefore the behavior of the steady - state solution will be much like that of the driven damped _ linear _ harmonic oscillator .",
    "that is , for small amplitude motion , the @xmath92 term in ( 2.3 ) will be negligible compared to the other terms .",
    "we also know that , because of damping , there will be only _ one _ steady - state solution , and therefore @xmath0 has only _ one _ fixed point @xmath93 such that @xmath94 ( here we use the super or subscript @xmath19 to denote _ fixed _ whereas in earlier sections it denoted _",
    "final_. ) finally , again because of damping , we know that this fixed point is _ stable_. that is , if @xmath0 is applied repeatedly to a point near @xmath93 , the result is a sequence of points that approach ever closer to @xmath93 .",
    "for this reason a stable fixed point is also called an _",
    "attractor_.    figure 1 shows the values of @xmath95 for the case @xmath96 , and figure 2 shows @xmath97 . in the figures the phase - space axes are labeled as @xmath98 and @xmath99 to indicate that what are being displayed are steady - state values reached after a large number of applications of @xmath0 . as anticipated , we observe from figures 1 and 2 that the response is much like the resonance response of the driven damped linear harmonic oscillator . to exhibit a resonance - like peak as a function of @xmath72 that dictated the choice ( 2.2 ) for @xmath62 . ] note that the coefficient of @xmath66 in ( 2.3 ) is 1 , and therefore at small amplitudes , where @xmath92 can be neglected , the duffing oscillator described by ( 2.3 ) has a natural frequency near 1 .",
    "correspondingly , figure 1 displays a large response when the driving frequency has the value @xmath100 .",
    "observe , however , that the response , while similar , is not exactly like that of the driven damped linear harmonic oscillator .",
    "for example , the resonance peak at @xmath100 is slightly tipped to the right , and there is also a small peak for @xmath101 .     as a function of @xmath72 ( when @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) for the stroboscopic duffing map.,height=432 ]     as a function of @xmath72 ( when @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) for the stroboscopic duffing map.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    our strategy for further exploration will be to increase the value of the driving strength @xmath71 , all the while observing the stroboscopic duffing map feigenbaum diagram as a function of @xmath72 .",
    "we hasten to add the disclaimer that the driven duffing oscillator displays an enormously rich behavior that varies widely with the parameter values @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and we shall be able to give a brief summary of only some of it . also , for brevity , we shall generally only display @xmath95 .",
    "figure 3 shows the @xmath66 feigenbaum diagram for the case of somewhat larger driving strength , @xmath104 . for this driving strength the resonance peak , which previously occurred at @xmath100 ,",
    "has shifted to a higher frequency and taken on a more complicated structure .",
    "there are now also noticeable resonances at lower frequencies , with the most prominent one being at @xmath105 .",
    "examination of figure 3 shows that for @xmath106 there is a single stable fixed point whose trail is shown in black .",
    "then , as @xmath72 is increased , a pair of fixed points is born at @xmath107 . , but are then complex .",
    "they first become purely real , and therefore physically apparent , when @xmath107 .",
    "] one of them is stable . the other ,",
    "whose trail as @xmath72 is varied is shown in red , is _",
    "unstable_. that is , if @xmath50 is applied repeatedly to a point near this fixed point , the result is a sequence of points that move ever farther away from the fixed point .",
    "for this reason an unstable fixed point is also called a _",
    "repellor_.    this appearance of two fixed points out of nowhere is called a saddle - node _ bifurcation _ or a _ blue - sky _ bifurcation , and the associated feigenbaum diagram is then sometimes called a bifurcation diagram .",
    "the original stable fixed point persists as @xmath72 is further increased so that over some @xmath72 range there are 3 fixed points .",
    "then , as @xmath72 is further increased , the original fixed point and the unstable fixed point move until they meet and annihilate when @xmath108 .",
    "this disappearance is called an inverse saddle - node or inverse blue - sky bifurcation .",
    "finally , for still larger @xmath72 values there is again only one fixed point , and it is stable .     as a function of @xmath72 ( when @xmath102 and @xmath109 ) for the stroboscopic duffing map .",
    "trails of the stable fixed points are shown in black .",
    "also shown , in red , is the trail of the unstable fixed point .",
    "finally , jumps in the steady - state amplitude are illustrated by vertical dashed lines at @xmath110 and @xmath111.,width=480 ]    we remark that the appearance and disappearance of stable - unstable fixed - point pairs , as @xmath72 is varied , has a striking dynamical consequence .",
    "suppose , for example in the case of figure 3 , that the driving frequency @xmath72 is below the value @xmath110 where the saddle - node bifurcation occurs .",
    "then there is only one fixed point , and it is attracting . now suppose @xmath72 is _ slowly _ increased .",
    "then , since the fixed - point solution is attracting , the solution for the slowly increasing @xmath72 case will remain near this solution .",
    "see the upper black trail in figure 3 .",
    "tracking \" will continue until @xmath72 reaches the value @xmath111 where the inverse saddle - node bifurcation occurs . at this value",
    "the fixed point being followed disappears .",
    "consequently , since the one remaining fixed point is also an attractor , the solution evolves very quickly to that of the remaining fixed point .",
    "it happens that the oscillation amplitude associated with this fixed point is much smaller , and therefore there appears to be a sudden jump in oscillation amplitude to a smaller value . now suppose @xmath72 is slowly decreased from a value above the value @xmath111 where the inverse saddle - node bifurcation occurs",
    ". then the solution will remain near that of the fixed point lying on the bottom black trail in figure 3 .",
    "this tracking will continue until @xmath72 reaches the value @xmath110 where the fixed point being followed disappears .",
    "again , since the remaining fixed point is attracting , the solution will now evolve to that of the remaining fixed point .",
    "the result is a jump to a larger oscillation amplitude .",
    "evidently the steady - state oscillation amplitude exhibits _ hysteresis _ as @xmath72 is slowly varied back and forth over an interval that begins below the value where the first saddle - node bifurcation occurs and ends at a value above that where the inverse saddle - node bifurcation occurs .",
    "let us continue to increase @xmath71 .",
    "figure 4 shows that a qualitatively new feature appears when @xmath71 is near 2.2 : a _ bubble _ is formed between the major resonant peak ( the one that has saddle - node bifurcated ) and the subresonant peak immediately to its left . to explore the nature of this bubble ,",
    "let us make @xmath71 still larger , which , we anticipate , will result in the bubble becoming larger .",
    "figure 5 shows the feigenbaum diagram in the case @xmath112 .",
    "now the major resonant peak and the subresonant peak have moved to larger @xmath72 values .",
    "correspondingly , the bubble between them has also moved to larger @xmath72 values .",
    "moreover , it is larger , yet another smaller bubble has formed , and the subresonant peak between them has also undergone a saddle - node bifurcation . for future use , we will call the major resonant peak the _ first _ or _ leading _ saddle - node bifurcation , and we will call the subresonant peak between the two bubbles the _ second _ saddle - node bifurcation , etc .",
    "also , we will call the bubble just to the left of the first saddle - node bifurcation the _ first _ or _ leading _ bubble , and the next bubble will be called the _",
    "second _ bubble , etc .",
    "we also note that three short trails have appeared in figure 5 just to the right of @xmath113 .",
    "they correspond to a period - three bifurcation followed shortly thereafter by an inverse bifurcation .",
    "actually , much closer examination shows that there are six trails consisting of three closely - spaced pairs .",
    "each pair comprises a stable and an unstable fixed point of the map @xmath114 .",
    "they are not fixed points of @xmath0 itself , but rather are sent into each other in cyclic fashion under the action of @xmath0 .     as a function of @xmath72 ( when @xmath102 and @xmath115 ) for the stroboscopic duffing map .",
    "it displays that a bubble has now formed at @xmath116.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]     as a function of @xmath72 ( when @xmath102 and @xmath112 ) for the stroboscopic duffing map .",
    "the first bubble has grown , a second smaller bubble has formed to its left , and the subresonant peak between them has saddle - node bifurcated to become the second saddle - node bifurcation.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    figure 6 shows the larger ( leading ) bubble in figure 5 in more detail and with the addition of red lines indicating the trails of unstable fixed points .",
    "it reveals that the bubble describes the _ simultaneous _ bifurcation of a single fixed point into three fixed points .",
    "two of these fixed points are stable and the third , whose @xmath66 coordinate as a function of @xmath72 are shown as a red line , is unstable .",
    "what happens is that , as @xmath72 is increased , a _",
    "stable fixed point becomes a _",
    "triplet _ of fixed points , two of which are stable and one of which is unstable .",
    "this is called a _ pitchfork",
    "_ bifurcation .",
    "then , as @xmath72 is further increased , these three fixed points again merge , in an inverse pitchfork bifurcation , to form what is again a single stable fixed point .",
    "we end our numerical study of the duffing equation by increasing @xmath71 from its earlier value @xmath117 to much larger values .",
    "first we will set @xmath118 .",
    "based on our experience so far , we might anticipate that the feigenbaum diagram would become much more complicated .",
    "that is indeed the case .",
    "figure 7 displays @xmath98 when @xmath119 and @xmath118 , as a function of @xmath72 , for the range @xmath120 . evidently the behavior of the attractors for the stroboscopic duffing map , which is what is shown in figure 7 , is extremely complicated .",
    "there are now a great many fixed points both of @xmath0 itself and various powers of @xmath0 . for small values of @xmath72 , and as in figures 3 through 5",
    ", there are many resonant peaks and numerous saddle - node and pitchfork bifurcations . for larger values of @xmath72",
    "there are more complicated bifurcations . in this figure , and some subsequent figures , the coloring scheme is chosen to guide the eye in following bifurcation trees with colors changing when the period changes . points with period one are colored red and points of very high or no discernible period are colored black .    of particular interest to us",
    "are the two areas around @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "they contain what has become of the first two bubbles in figure 6 , and are shown in greater magnification in figure 8 .",
    "what has happened is that bubbles have formed within bubbles , and bubbles have formed within these bubbles , etc . to produce a cascade",
    "however , these interior bubbles are not the result of pitchfork bifurcations , but rather the result of _ period - doubling _ bifurcations . for example",
    ", the bifurcation that creates the first bubble at @xmath123 is a pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "but the successive bifurcations within the bubble are period - doubling bifurcations . in a period - doubling bifurcation",
    "a fixed point that is initially stable becomes unstable as @xmath72 is increased .",
    "when this happens , simultaneously two stable fixed points of @xmath124 are born .",
    "they are not fixed points of @xmath0 itself , but rather are sent into each other under the action of @xmath0 .",
    "hence the name  period doubling \" .",
    "the map @xmath0 must be applied twice to send such a fixed point back into itself . in the next period doubling ,",
    "fixed points of @xmath125 are born , etc .",
    "however we note that , as @xmath72 increases , the sequence of period - doubling bifurcations only occurs a _",
    "finite _ number of times and then undoes itself .",
    "remarkably , when @xmath71 is just somewhat larger , _ infinite _ sequences of period doubling cascades can occur .",
    "figure 9 shows what happens when @xmath126 .     as a function of @xmath72 ( when @xmath102 and @xmath127 ) for the stroboscopic duffing map.,height=480 ]     as a function of @xmath72 ( when @xmath102 and @xmath127 ) for the stroboscopic duffing map .",

    "figures 11 and 12 show successive enlargements of parts of the first bubble in figure 9 . from figure 10",
    "we see that the first bubble forms as a result of a pitchfork bifurcation just to the right of @xmath129 , and from figures 11 and 12 we see that the first period doubling bifurcation occurs in the vicinity of @xmath130 . from figure 12",

    "in this section we will compare the behavior of the exact map @xmath56 with polynomial ( truncated taylor series ) maps @xmath57 obtained by integrating the complete variational equations . in particular , we will make this comparison in the vicinity of the infinite period doubling cascade displayed in figures 12 through 14 since duplicating the intricate behavior in this vicinity would seem to be particularly challenging . as an additional challenge , we will employ polynomial maps that involve expansions in the parameter @xmath72 as well .",
