    "with the development of electromagnetic and optics technology and the increasing demands in industrial and military applications , scattering from periodic structures @xcite have attracted much interest in recent years . a variety of numerical methods including finite difference methods @xcite , finite element methods @xcite , spectral and spectral element methods @xcite , integral equation methods @xcite , dirichlet - to - neumann map methods @xcite , and mode expansion method @xcite have been developed by the engineering community and the applied mathematical community for solving linear diffraction problems from periodic structures .",
    "finite difference and finite element methods are easy to implement and result in sparse linear systems , which enable the use of sparse direct solvers .",
    "however , these methods typically have significant dispersion errors for high - frequency problems and thus fail to provide accurate solutions .",
    "if the medium is piecewise constant , boundary integral equations formulated on the interfaces of multilayer structures @xcite or the boundaries of the obstacles @xcite are natural and mathematically rigorous . by exploiting high - order quadratures , one obtains much higher efficiency and accuracy than finite difference and finite element methods . for problems with general medium , spectral methods @xcite can be employed .",
    "they are simple to implement and typically require relatively small number of unknowns to attain a fixed accuracy .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a brief survey of existing spectral methods for partial differential equations .    in this paper , we consider 2d quasi - periodic scattering problems . by introducing transparent boundary conditions ,",
    "the problem is governed by a helmholtz equation with variable coefficients defined on rectangular domains .",
    "we propose a spectral collocation method and a tensor product spectral method .",
    "the first one uses the spectral collocation techniques @xcite and the second one , based on separable representations of the differential operator , combines the fourier spectral method and the ultraspherical spectral method @xcite . for vertically layered medium case , both methods only require to solve a one dimensional problem .",
    "the two spectral methods proposed in this paper can adaptively determine the number of unknowns and approximate the solution to a high accuracy .",
    "we remark that the tensor product spectral method leads to matrices that are banded or almost banded . by employing the fast algorithm in @xcite",
    ", a layered medium approximation problem can be used as a preconditioner for the problem with general media .",
    "recently , chebfun software @xcite was extended to solve problems in two dimensions @xcite , both of which are nonperiodic .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the summary of the mathematics and algorithms of chebyshev technology for nonperiodic functions .",
    "extension to periodic functions in one dimension was proposed in @xcite .",
    "our spectral methods can be used to solve the problems in two space dimensions , one of which is periodic .",
    "implementing our methods with the adaptive strategies of chebfun software is easy .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 the model problem is formulated and further reduced to a boundary value problem . in ",
    "3 we present the spectral collocation method for the problem .",
