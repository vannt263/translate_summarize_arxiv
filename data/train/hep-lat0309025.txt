    "one of the outstanding problems in lattice qcd is to compute physical quantities reliably when the quarks have a small mass .",
    "all conventional algorithms suffer from critical slowing down as the quark masses are lowered . today",
    ", most calculations use quarks that are heavy and the results are then extrapolated to the chiral limit using chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) . whether chpt is applicable to the data in the range of quark masses that are accessible today , is highly debatable @xcite .",
    "the evidence for chiral singularities predicted by chpt is weak .",
    "the chiral singularities are logarithmic in four dimensions and power - like in three dimensions .",
    "even the power - like singularities , which are well known in spin models @xcite , have yet to be seen in lattice qcd calculations .",
    "it has been predicted that qcd with two massless flavors of quarks will undergo a finite temperature second order chiral phase transition in the @xmath1 universality class @xcite .",
    "although there is clear evidence for such a phase transition from lattice calculations , the above difficulties with chiral extrapolations also affect our ability to establish the universal properties of the phase transition .",
    "in particular no precision calculations for the critical exponents exist that match with expectations and rule out other universality classes with similar exponents .",
    "for example , lattice qcd with staggered quarks contains an exact @xmath0 chiral symmetry which is a subgroup of the full chiral symmetry . in a two flavor theory ,",
    "this symmetry is expected to be dynamically enhanced in the continuum limit to the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "ideally it should be possible to show that on coarse lattices the chiral phase transition belongs to the @xmath0 universality class and as the continuum limit is reached the universality class must change to @xmath1 . at present results from lattice simulations do not appear to match with either @xmath0 or @xmath1 universality class @xcite .",
    "although , results with two flavors of wilson quarks appear to show consistency with @xmath1 critical behavior @xcite , these lattice fermions do not even possess the relevant chiral symmetry .",
    "the presence of a parity - flavor broken phase nearby complicates matters further .",
    "more work is necessary before one can understand the results of @xcite .",
    "given these difficulties it is useful to find at least some point in the phase diagram of lattice qcd where precision calculations with massless quarks are possible . in this article",
    "we consider the strong coupling limit of lattice qcd with staggered quarks .",
    "although , this limit has the worst lattice artifacts , it is a good toy model that shares some qualitative features of qcd .",
    "the quarks are confined and the system is known to break the remnant @xmath0 chiral symmetry .",
    "computationally the theory simplifies enormously since all the gauge field integrals can be performed exactly .",
    "however , the remaining dynamics of quarks is still non - trivial and leads to an interesting theory .",
    "the phase diagram in the temperature versus baryon density plane is also expected to be interesting @xcite .",
    "the strong coupling limit was first studied with mean field methods @xcite .",
    "later numerical simulations were proposed to understand the theory from first principles @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , all monte carlo algorithms developed so far have suffered from critical slowing down near the chiral limit .",
    "for this reason calculations were performed away from the chiral limit which limited their precision in determining chiral quantities .",
    "the dream to accurately solve lattice qcd , even in this simplified limit , remains unfulfilled .    over the last decade",
    "a revolution has occurred in the field of monte carlo algorithms .",
    "a variety of classical and quantum lattice models can now be solved accurately using cluster algorithms that can beat critical slowing down very efficiently .",
    "a recent review of the progress can be found in @xcite .",
    "recently , an extension of these ideas has led to the discovery of the directed - path algorithm for studying the chiral limit of strongly coupled lattice gauge theories @xcite .",
    "for the first time this algorithm allows us to precisely compute quantities in the chiral limit without further approximations .    in this article",
    "we apply the new algorithm to study the finite temperature chiral phase transition in strongly coupled lattice qcd with massless staggered quarks .",
    "we focus on the physics of pions and the universal properties near the phase transition at zero baryon density .",
    "we use @xmath2 gauge fields instead of @xmath3 in order to avoid inefficiencies in the algorithm due to the existence of baryonic loops in @xmath3 .",
