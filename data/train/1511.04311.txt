    "the strong population of the very narrow ( @xmath8 kev ) 9.50 mev @xmath0 resonance by the @xmath2c(d , p)@xmath1c reaction provides a means to test two - step reaction models .",
    "the observed population is incompatible with a simple @xmath5 single - particle structure for this level , and structure calculations , see e.g.  refs.@xcite , predict a dominant contribution from the @xmath6 configuration built on the 4.44 mev @xmath9 excited state of the @xmath2c core .",
    "however , the wave function of this state is expected to contain a small ( of the order of 1 % ) contribution from the @xmath5 configuration as well as larger components built on the @xmath10 excited state of the @xmath2c core . to date , possible contributions from configurations built on the 9.64 mev @xmath11 state of the @xmath2c core have not been considered .",
    "the initial motivation of this work was therefore to search for the influence of hypothetical components of this type on the measured @xmath2c(d , p)@xmath1c angular distribution for stripping to the @xmath0 resonance at an incident deuteron energy of 30 mev @xcite .",

    "_ @xcite employed calculated @xmath1c wave functions including components built on the @xmath12 , @xmath3 and @xmath10 states of the @xmath2c core .",
    "the two - step ( d , p ) transitions proceeding via the @xmath10 state were , however , neglected , since they were found to have only a small effect on the results . in this work we adopted a different approach , instead varying the spectroscopic amplitudes for the various components in order to obtain the best description of the angular distribution .",
    "we included two - step transfer paths via the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states of @xmath2c as well as the direct path .",
    "following ohnuma _",
    "_ we omitted transfer paths proceeding via the @xmath2c @xmath10 state .",
    "we limited the configurations built on the excited states of the @xmath2c core to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 , since we considered these to be the most important components , to keep the number of directly variable parameters within manageable proportions .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "firstly we describe in detail the calculations , then compare the results with the high quality data of ref .",
    "@xcite , and finally present our conclusions .",
    "all calculations were performed with the code fresco @xcite .",
    "inelastic excitation of the 4.44 mev @xmath3 and 9.64 mev @xmath4 states of @xmath2c was included as well as the @xmath2c(d , p)@xmath1c stripping reaction leading to the 9.50 mev @xmath0 state .",
    "the entrance channel optical potential was based on the global parameters of daehnick _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite with the real and imaginary well depths adjusted to obtain the best fit to the elastic scattering data of perrin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite when the inelastic couplings were included .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) were taken from refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "nuclear deformation lengths were fixed by fitting the 60.6 mev inelastic scattering data of aspelund _",
    "@xcite , yielding values of @xmath15 fm and @xmath16 fm .",
    "the exit channel p + @xmath1c optical potential was calculated using the ch89 global parameters @xcite .",
    "more modern optical potential parameterizations , e.g.  that of an and cai @xcite for the deuteron or that of koning and delaroche @xcite for the proton in the exit channel , could equally well have been used as a basis for our calculations .",
    "however , we do not expect that their use would significantly change our results , since ohnuma _",
    "@xcite tested several sets of deuteron and proton potentials in their analysis with no significant difference in the final results .",
    "the @xmath17 overlap was calculated using the reid soft core potential @xcite and included the small d - state component .",
    "again , a more modern nucleon - nucleon potential such as the argonne @xmath18 @xcite could have been used but the reid potential is available in fresco as a standard input and we do not anticipate any significant difference in our results from the use of a more modern parameterization . for",
    "the @xmath19 overlaps the neutron was bound in a woods - saxon well with geometry parameters @xmath20 fm , @xmath21 fm .",
    "since the transferred neutron is unbound with respect to the @xmath2c core in both its ground and 4.44 mev @xmath3 excited states the @xmath5 and @xmath6 components of the wave function were calculated in continuum bins , of widths 2.0 and 0.1 mev , respectively , the well depths being adjusted to give resonances at the corresponding energies . the transferred neutron is bound with respect to the @xmath2c core in its 9.64 mev @xmath4 state so for the @xmath7 component of the wave function the well depth was adjusted to give the appropriate binding energy .",
    "initial calculations used the ccba formalism , i.e.  the inelastic scattering steps in the entrance channel were treated using full coupled channel ( cc ) theory but the transfer steps were described using the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) .",
    "we varied the spectroscopic amplitudes for the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 components of the wave function for the @xmath1c 9.50 mev @xmath0 state to obtain the best description of the 30 mev @xmath2c(d , p)@xmath1c stripping data of ohnuma _ et al .",
    "however , we found that in order to describe the data completely it was essential to use full coupled reaction channels ( crc ) theory for the transfer steps .",
    "therefore , the results presented here are for crc calculations .",
    "all calculations were full finite - range crc and included both the complex remnant term and the non - orthogonality correction .",
    "the post form of the formalism was used in all cases .",
    "in fig .  [ fig1 ] we compare the results of our best fit crc calculations with the data of ohnuma _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the full calculation describes the data well over their whole angular range .",
    "a breakdown of the full calculation into its three components , i.e. direct one - step transfer via the @xmath2c @xmath12 ground state , two - step transfer via the 4.44 mev @xmath2c @xmath3 state and two - step transfer via the 9.64 mev @xmath4 state , shows that the shape of the measured angular distribution can only be satisfactorily reproduced as a result of interference effects between the direct one - step transfer and the two - step transfer via the @xmath3 state .",
    "two - step transfer via the @xmath4 state is seen to be almost two orders of magnitude smaller than the data , making a small but nonetheless necessary contribution to the overall description of the full angular range of the data .",
    "the best fit spectroscopic amplitudes for the three components of the 9.50 mev @xmath0 wave function are given in table [ tab1 ] . while we do not expect these to be _ quantitatively _ accurate  our calculations do not by any means include all the processes that may influence the absolute values , in particular deuteron breakup ",
    "they should be _ qualitatively _ reasonable , which is sufficient for our purposes here .",
    "including additional effects such as the deuteron breakup would have made searching on all three spectroscopic amplitudes prohibitively time consuming .",
    ".[tab1]best fit spectroscopic amplitudes and corresponding mixing ratios obtained from the analysis of the 30 mev @xmath2c(d , p)@xmath1c stripping data @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     however , we can definitely state that , while small , the spectroscopic amplitude for the @xmath22 component must be negative in order to produce the required interference effect ( fresco adopts the convention that all bound state wave functions lead off positive from @xmath23 ) .",
    "the corresponding mixing ratios ( defined as the percentage contributions of the individual components of the wave function to the whole in terms of the spectroscopic _ factors _ ) show that in spite of the comparable importance of the cross sections the direct one - step transfer path probes only about @xmath24 % of the wave function of the @xmath1c @xmath0 state compared to @xmath25 % for the two - step path via the @xmath2c @xmath3 excited state .",
    "in fact , our mixing ratios compare rather well with those of ohnuma _ et al .",
    "we therefore confirm the results of the ccba calculations of ohnuma _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite who also found that inclusion of the direct one - step transfer path had an important influence on the @xmath2c(d , p)@xmath1c(@xmath26 ) stripping angular distribution , in spite of the small contribution of the @xmath5 component to the @xmath1c @xmath26 wave function .",
    "we find that the use of crc as opposed to ccba improves considerably the agreement between calculated and measured angular distributions , eliminating the minimum in the ccba angular distribution at about @xmath27 , not present in the data , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . a similar result for ccba",
    "was obtained by ohnuma _",
    "@xcite ( cf .",
    "fig .  9 of ref .",
    "the main result of our analysis is in many respects similar to that of ohnuma _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , since we find that inclusion of the direct one - step transfer path is essential to describe the stripping angular distribution , in spite of the small contribution of the @xmath5 component to the wave function of the @xmath1c @xmath0 state .",
    "in addition , we find that the small contribution from the two - step path via the @xmath2c @xmath4 state is necessary for a good description of the entire angular range of the data , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ; this result has some important general implications for other studies of this kind which have not been explored .",
    "the @xmath2c(d , p)@xmath1c stripping leading to the 9.50 mev @xmath0 resonance in @xmath1c is a striking reminder that when attempting to extract nuclear structure information from a fit to direct reaction data the measured cross section is a product of both nuclear structure factors and what we may term the `` kinematics '' of the reaction , e.g.  matching of q - value and momentum transfer etc . while the addition of the components built on the @xmath10 excited state of the @xmath2c core had an important influence on the structure calculations , ohnuma _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found their contribution to the calculated angular distribution to be negligible .",
    "this may be explained as due to the `` kinematic '' effect of having to find the 14 mev of excitation energy for reaction paths proceeding via the @xmath10 core state and its weak excitation in inelastic scattering , suggesting that it proceeds via a two - step mechanism @xcite .",
    "even the more modest 9.64 mev of the @xmath4 state is sufficient to damp out almost completely the contribution of reaction paths proceeding via this state , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    very precise data  with an uncertainty of better than @xmath28 % are required in order to be sensitive directly to the contribution from the two - step transfer path via the @xmath2c @xmath4 excited state .",
    "we therefore wish to underline that the `` kinematics '' may set a limitation on the sensitivity of direct reaction data to the composition of the wave function of the final state in systems where the reaction mechanism has significant contributions from two - step paths .",
    "conversely , due to the folding of kinematic effects together with the nuclear structure , the inclusion of reaction paths probing apparently small components of the wave function may be essential in order to describe the reaction data .",
    "the data for deuteron stripping to the 9.50 mev @xmath0 resonance in @xmath1c currently under discussion provide a good example of this .    to sum up , when attempting to extract `` empirical '' mixing ratios for the various possible configurations of states with suspected significant core excitation components or when trying to validate calculated wave functions for such states by comparisons with direct reaction data , it should be borne in mind that kinematics may dominate over structure in the calculated angular distributions .",
    "this is particularly so when the core states are relatively high - lying ; exactly how high - lying will probably depend on the incident energy of the particle inducing the reaction .",
    "one may well find that under these circumstances the reaction data are actually more sensitive to the smallest components of the wave function if these happen to be those involving the core nucleus in its ground state or lowest - lying excited state or states .",
