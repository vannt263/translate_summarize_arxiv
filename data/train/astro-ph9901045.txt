    "determination of the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) from diffuse sky measurements is greatly hampered by the presence of foreground emission and scattered light from the interplanetary dust ( ipd ) cloud , and emission from discrete and unresolved stellar components in our galaxy , and from dust in the interstellar medium ( ism ) . in a recent publication ,",
    "hauser et al . ( 1998 ; hereafter h98 ) presented the results of the search for the cib in the 1.25 to 240 wavelength region that was conducted with the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) on the _ cosmic background explorer _",
    "( _ cobe _ ) satellite .",
    "careful subtraction of foreground emission from the ipd cloud ( kelsall et al .",
    "1998 ) and from stellar and interstellar galactic emission components ( arendt et al . 1998 ) revealed a residual emission component in the dirbe skymaps that , after detailed analysis of the random and systematic uncertainties , was consistent with a positive signal at 100 , 140 , and 240  @xmath1 m .",
    "subsequent rigorous tests showed that only the 140 and 240 signals were isotropic , a strict requirement for their extragalactic origin .",
    "only upper limits for the cib intensity were given for @xmath2  =  1.25  @xmath3  60  @xmath1 m , where the cib detection was hindered by residual emission from the ipd cloud .",
    "in the 1.25 to 4.9  wavelength region , uncertainties in the subtraction of the galactic stellar component contributed to the uncertainties as well .",
    "the upper limits on the cib determined by h98 can be found in table 2 of their paper .",
    "here we briefly summarize a new method for the subtraction of the galactic stellar emission component . instead of using a statistical model to characterize the galactic stellar emission ( arendt et al .",
    "1998 ) , we create a spatial template of this emission from the dirbe data itself .",
    "the method is described in more detail by dwek & arendt ( 1998 ; hereafter da98 ) . in this contribution",
    "we emphasize isotropy tests conducted on the residual emission to examine its possible extragalactic origin .",
    "we use the dirbe 1.25 , 2.2 , 3.5 , and 4.9 all sky maps from which the emission from interplanetary dust ( ipd ) has been subtracted ( kelsall et al . 1998 ) as the starting point in the analysis .",
    "the intensity of these maps should , in principle , contain only the galactic emission ( starlight and ism emission ) and the cib .",
    "we then use the ipd@xmath3emission subtracted 2.2 skymap to create a template map for the galactic stellar emission component at this wavelength .",
    "the 2.2 map is particularly suitable for our analysis , since the contribution from interstellar dust emission is negligible at this wavelength .",
    "furthermore , ground@xmath3based galaxy counts in the k - band ( e.g. gardner 1996 ) provide a strict lower limit of 7.4  to the cib intensity at this wavelength which can be used as the nominal value for the cib at 2.2 @xmath4 .",
    "the spatial template of the galactic stellar emission component is derived by subtracting this uniform intensity from the 2.2 @xmath4 zodi@xmath3subtracted skymap .",
    "the final results of our analysis depend only weakly on the adopted 2.2 @xmath4 cib intensity , and we explicitly state their dependence on this value .",
    "the slopes of the correlations represent the colors of stellar emission , and are in very good agreement with the colors of m and k giants shown in figure 2 of arendt et al .",
    "the intercepts of the correlations represent the residual emission . at 3.5 and 4.9",
    "we had to subtract the small contribution of emission from interstellar dust .",
    "the final step in the analysis consisted of testing the residual emission components for positivity and isotropy , the two criteria required to ascertain their extragalactic nature ( h98 ) .",
    "the analysis concentrated on high quality ( hq ) regions of the sky , identified as such for their location at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath5 ) and ecliptic latitudes ( @xmath6 ) , in which the contributions from the galactic and zodiacal emission components are relatively small compared to other regions of the sky .",
    "figure 1 in h98 depicts the location of these hq regions .",
    "the error analysis ( see da98 for further details ) shows that our method significantly reduces the errors associated with the subtraction of galactic starlight .",
    "however , only at 3.5 and 4.9 are the residuals positive , and as described in more detail below , only the 3.5 residual is nearly isotropic . a panel of three dirbe 3.5 maps depicting the as observed sky , the sky after the removal of the interplanetary dust emission , and the final residual map after the subtraction of the galactic starlight and ism emission was presented by cowen ( 1998 ) .",
    "any extragalactic signal is expected to be isotropic , barring small fluctuations expected from the discrete distribution of galaxies .",
    "we therefore conducted several isotropy tests on the residual intensities in the 3.5 and 4.9 bands , which in increasing order of complexity consisted of : ( a ) comparison of mean intensities in the various hq regions ; ( b ) examination of large scale gradients ; and ( c ) analysis of the two point correlation function in the hq regions .",
    "table 1 in da98 shows that the residual 3.5  emission is isotropic , as evident from the agreement between the mean intensities in the various hq regions .",
    "the 4.9 residuals failed this simple isotropy test .",
    "examination of large scale gradients in the residual 3.5 map shows that they are significantly reduced compared to those found in the residual intensity map presented by h98 .",
    "a comparison between the cuts in the residual intensity maps derived by the two methods is presented in figure 1 .",
    "although greatly reduced , the bottom panel of fig . 1 still shows the presence of large scale gradients in the residual map . at low galactic latitudes ( @xmath7 in figure 1 )",
    "the gradient is largely due to residual galactic stellar emission which is affected by dust extinction .",
    "dust extinction is negligible in the hq regions .",
    "additional gradients are due to the incomplete subtraction of the ipd emission .",
    "the same gradient seen in the 3.5 image is significantly stronger in the 4.9 residual map , and is responsible for the larger dispersion in the mean intensities in the various hq regions .",
    "we therefore consider the 4.9 result as only an upper limit .",
    "we also performed a two point correlation analysis of the residuals , a strict isotropy test adopted by h98 . in this test the two point correlation function of the residual emission is compared to that of a simulated flat background posessing random gaussian uncertainties estimated from the dirbe data ( h98 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the results of our analysis .",
    "the top panel shows the two point correlation function of the residuals presented by h98 ( figure 3 in their paper ) .",
    "the middle panel shows the two point correlation function of the residuals using our method for subtracting the galactic stellar emisison component , but with the same uncertainties in the residual maps as those adopted by h98 .",
    "these uncertainties are dominated by unremoved stellar emission , visible as small@xmath3scale structure in the residuals shown in figure 1 . with these uncertainties , the residual emission is isotropic .",
    "the bottom panel shows the two point correlation function of the residuals obtained by using the new method for foreground subtraction , and their reduced uncertainties .",
    "note the large change in scale compared to the previous panels .",
    "because of the smaller uncertainties , the residual emission does not pass the strict two point correlation isotropy test .",
    "if we used only the the mean intensities in the various hq patches as the criterion for isotropy , the 3.5 residual would classify as a definite detection of the cib . however , because of the persistence of large scale gradients ( albeit largely reduced compared to the previous analysis ) , and the existence of correlations between the pixel intensities beyond what one would expect from a flat background , we only regard the derived residual intensity as a tentative detection of the cib at 3.5 with an intensity given by :      where the quoted errors represent 1 @xmath9 uncertainties , and @xmath10 $ ] represents the difference in the actual value of the cib at 2.2  @xmath4 ( in ) and the nominal value adopted in our model .",
    "our analysis also yields new upper limits ( 95% confidence limit ) on the cib at 1.25 and 4.9 of 68 and 36 , respectively ."
