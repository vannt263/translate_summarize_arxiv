    "the recent high resolution cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation measurements ( see , for instance @xcite ) provide a possibility for quantitative investigation of the nontrivial processes taking place at the _ decoupling _ of the baryon - photon plasma ( fluid ) in the early universe . before the decoupling the cmb photons",
    "were tightly coupled to the baryons by photon scattering ( mainly from the free electrons ) forming so - called baryon - photon fluid . at a certain stage of the early universe expansion the energy of the cmb photons",
    "becomes insufficient to keep hydrogen ionized and a recombination process becomes dominating in the baryon - photon fluid .",
    "the recombination is a gradual process , but it serves as a trigger and a catalyst of the decoupling of the baryon - photon fluid . before the decoupling the baryons and photons were tightly coupled whereas after the decoupling the photons are effectively free .",
    "physical processes at the decoupling itself can be described on different levels . in present paper",
    "we will concentrate on the _ coherent _ properties of the decoupling .",
    "it is well known that the main energy of the plasma fluctuations at a certain ( advance ) stage of the decoupling process is concentrated in the coherent states ( the acoustic coherent oscillations - stochastic standing waves ) .",
    "originally the acoustic oscillations become phase - coherent when the causal horizon overtakes their wavelength . around the last scattering surface",
    "the radiation density and ionization are high enough that the photon drag on the baryons can be still significant .",
    "therefore , the baryons are involved in the coherent motion by the photon drag , which differentially accelerates the ions and electrons .",
    "the resulting significant electron - ion drift generates large - scale _ coherent _ electric currents and fields , which rather quickly become comparable to the photon drag in their effect on the electrons ( see , for instance , @xcite,@xcite ) . while we can readily introduce the photon ( thomson ) drag in the dynamical plasma equations it is rather nontrivial task to describe the coherent ( collective ) phenomena at the decoupling , which are crucial for the entire process . to tackle this problem we suggest to use an effective nonlinear schrdinger equation for macroscopic wave function , which is a complex - valued classical field that specifies the index of the coherent state . to the leading order each coherent state evolves along its classical trajectory which is given by the corresponding nonlinear schrdinger equation",
    "the idea is based on the ehrenfest s theorem stating that the the expectation values of displacement and momentum given by the schrdinger equation obey time evolution equations which are analogous to classical ones in the the madelung representation . in this representation",
    "the macroscopic wave function of the free ( non recombined ) electrons can be defined as @xmath3 $ ] , where @xmath4 is the electron number density , @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 as the mass and velocity of the electrons , @xmath8 here is not the plank constant but a parameter characterizing coherence in the system ( real quantum effects are negligible in the considered situation , cf recent papers @xcite,@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "then , momentum equation for the electron can be considered as a nonlinear schrdinger equation for the macroscopic wave function @xmath9 : @xmath10 \\psi ,    \\eqno{(1)}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is a real - valued potential , @xmath12 is an effective potential represented by a real - valued function of the free electrons density @xmath13 .",
    "analogous approach at rather different circumstances was used for a mean field description of dense fermi plasmas ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) . unlike the quantum plasma considered in refs . @xcite,@xcite,@xcite the original ( input ) coherence at the decoupling comes from an external source ( cf section vi ) . at this description the addition of the effective potential @xmath12 to the equation ( 1 ) is possible due to a specific gauge invariance of the equation .",
    "namely , it can be readily shown that addition of the potential @xmath12 ( satisfying condition @xmath14 ) does not affect the classic limit ( i.e. the ehrenfest s theorem ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 is momentum .",
    "the effective potential can be also directly depending on @xmath17 , but the potential @xmath18 should be slowly varying on @xmath17 ( in the adiabatic terms of the ehrenfest s theorem ) .",
    "about a possibility of nonlocal dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath19 see section vi .",
    "it will be shown below that such type of invariance of the schrdinger equation is crucial for the condensation process .",
    "we deliberately have the dissipation term not included into the equation because we will concentrate on the large- and intermediate - scale processes , while the dissipation term is usually related to the small scales ( we will return to this problem below ) . the first term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 1 ) provides , in particular , a possibility of tunneling at the decoupling . on the other hand",
    ", it is believed that the nonlinear schrdinger equation can describe development of the coherent regimes @xcite-@xcite at a certain stage of evolution .",
    "theoretical considerations ( see for instance , @xcite,@xcite ) show that this regime can appear in a long - wavelength region of wavenumber space after the breakdown of the regime of weak turbulence : the kagan - svistunov ( ks- ) scenario .",
    "this is supported by recent numerical simulations for the weakly interacting bose gas @xcite and for the dense fermi plasmas @xcite .",
    "it is expected that there exist three different stages in the time development for the ks - scenario : weak turbulence , transitional turbulence and condensate .",
    "a pre - condensate begins its formation in a long - wavelength region at the transitional turbulent regime .",
    "this transitional turbulent regime is the most difficult for theoretical description @xcite .",
    "there is a problem to define a continuous vorticity filed in the quantum - like turbulence due to non - rotational nature of the velocity field defined on the wave function given by the schrdinger equation .",
    "velocity field defined on the wave functions is a potential field .",
    "vorticity of such field vanishes everywhere in a single - connected region .",
    "it is believed that in the condensate state itself all rotational flow is carried by quantized vortices ( the circulation of the velocity around the core of such vortex is quantized ) .",
    "this idea turned out to be very fruitful , and recent experiments give direct support for existence of such vortices in the condensate @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , for the transitional turbulence apparent absence of a continuous field associated with vorticity is a difficult problem .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the only flux of the particles from the region of lager energies toward the future condensate in not sufficient for transformation of the completely disordered initial weak turbulence into the condensate with its local superfluid order and with the tangles of quantized vortices .",
    "a certain vorticity - like quantity have to be involved in this process just before appearance of the tangles of quantized vortices . in present paper",
    "we study a generalized vorticity defined on the _ weighted _ velocity field .",
    "the generalized vorticity is not vanishing in the bulk of the flow .",
    "then , we show that adiabatic invariance of an enstrophy ( mean squared generalized vorticity ) controls the transitional turbulence just before formation of the condensate with its tangles of quantized vortices .",
    "since in the above described scenario the transitional turbulence already corresponds to a coherent regime ( in this regime the phases of the complex amplitudes of the field @xmath20 become strongly correlated ) we will speculate that an advance stage of the decoupling can be associated with the transitional turbulence regime of nonlinear schrdinger equation ( 1 ) .",
    "them we will consider significance of the generalized vorticity for the cmb photons visibility function , which is the main cmb characteristic of the decoupling stage .",
    "this scenario provokes an additional speculation : to associate the condensate regime itself ( with its tangles of quantized vortices - the topological defects ) with the universe state just after the decoupling .",
    "the recombination process considerably reduces the number of the free baryons before the last stage of the decoupling but a sufficient number of the free baryons can still exist at this stage in order to form a condensate due to the _ fast _ character of the condensation process ( section vii and fig .",
    "the far reaching consequences of such additional speculation are quiet obvious , cf for instance @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "let us recall certain well known properties of velocity field defined on the wave function . in order to calculate the expectation value of velocity",
    "one can evaluate the time derivative of space displacement @xmath21 : @xmath22 substituting @xmath23 provided by the eq .",

    "@xmath30 is _ orthogonal _ to the `` plane of motion '' , which is stretched over the vectors : @xmath31 and @xmath32 , at any point of the space . in this sense",
    "the transitional turbulence can be considered as a locally two - dimensional one .",
    "the second ( _ linear _ ) term @xmath33 in the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( 1 ) does not affect our further results and will be omitted for simplicity . dynamical equation for the generalized vorticity similarly to the dynamic equation for the density @xmath19 ( in a dimensionless form , for simplicity ) @xmath34 \\eqno{(8)}\\ ] ] does not contain the _ nonlinear _ terms explicitly @xmath35 +   [ \\nabla \\psi^ * \\times \\nabla ( \\delta \\psi ) ]   \\eqno{(9)}\\]](the right - hand - side terms in the eqs .",

    "( 8) , results ( after integration by parts ) in the conservation law for the total number of the particles : @xmath36 .",
    "the cancellation of the nonlinear terms in the dynamical equation for vorticity , eq .",
    "( 9 ) , results in a less strong result .",
    "namely , the enstrophy ( mean squared generalized vorticity ) turned out to be an adiabatic invariant for the transitional turbulence .",
    "according to the theoretical predictions @xcite,@xcite if one starts from a self - similar solution of the equation ( 1 ) for weak - nonlinear conditions , then the so - called coherent regime @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , will be developed at a certain stage of evolution .",
    "the first stage of evolution leads to an explosive increase of occupation numbers in the long - wavelength region of wavenumber space where the ordering process takes place . from the beginning of the coherent stage of the evolution",
    "we will call the long - wavelength region of wavenumber space as pre - condensate fraction , while the rest of the wavenumber space we will call as above - condensate fraction .    at a certain time , close to the blow - up time of the self - similar solution , the coherent regime sets in . after this time the system has a certain transitional turbulent period . at the end of this transitional period appearance of a well - defined tangle of quantized vortices",
    "indicates the final ( condensate ) stage of the evolution .",
    "therefore , generalized vorticity exchange between the pre - condensate and above - condensate fractions in the transitional period seems to be crucial for the process of the condensate formation in the ks - scenario .    in the case of space isotropy",
    "it is convenient to deal with an angle - averaged occupation numbers spectrum @xmath37 in variable @xmath38 in the wavenumber space @xmath39 the total number of particles associated with the pre - condensate fraction is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the wavenumber scale separating ( approximately ) the pre- and above - condensate fractions ( for its determination from numerical simulations see next section ) .",
    "then the total number of particles associated with the above - condensate fraction is : @xmath42 . from the dynamical conservation law for the total number of particles , @xmath43",
    ", we obtain @xmath44 then we can define exchange rate of the particles number , @xmath45 and as @xmath46    let us also consider angle - averaged enstrophy spectrum @xmath47 @xmath48 then , the enstrophy associated with the pre - condensate fraction is @xmath49 , whereas enstrophy associated with the above - condensate fraction is : @xmath50 .",
    "the intensive particle flux to the long - wavelength region of wavenumber space ( where the pre - condensate is formed ) involves the enstrophy one .",
    "unlike the total number of the particles , the average enstrophy @xmath51 is not an exact invariant of the motion .",
    "though , characteristic time scale of the enstrophy exchange between the pre- and above- condensate fractions is expected to be much smaller than the characteristic time scale of the @xmath51 evolution @xcite-@xcite . therefore , the @xmath51 can still be considered ( approximately ) as an adiabatic integral for the exchange process . as it is used for the adiabatic processes this statement can be formalized as following : @xmath52 (",
    "actually , only one of the ( 14 ) inequalities is sufficient for further consideration ) . for the nonlinear system",
    "the principal problem is _ invariance _ of the characteristic time - scales in ( 14 ) to the rescaling @xmath53 ( otherwise the inequalities ( 14 ) become meaningless ) .",
    "it can be readily shown that the cancellation of the nonlinear terms in the dynamical equations ( 8),(9 ) provides such invariance for the enstrophy based time - scales in eq .",
    "( 14 ) .    since for the transitional turbulence @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath51 are still of the same order",

    "( 12 ) @xmath60 i.e. the adiabatic invariance of the enstrophy substitutes its exact invariance in the case of the transitional turbulence .    for the weak nonlinearity one can expect that the angle - averaged spectrum @xmath37 for sufficiently large @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath45 ( cf @xcite,@xcite )",
    ". this can be also valid for the transitional turbulence for sufficiently large @xmath2 . then with the additional dimensional parameter @xmath61 ( which has dimension @xmath62 ) one obtains scaling law for sufficiently large @xmath2 from dimensional considerations @xmath63 the enstrophy exchange controls the particle exchange in this case .",
    "external dissipation or forcing can make the estimates ( 14 ) invalid and , hence , destroy this scenario ( cf @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "though , in the case of a sufficiently weak and linear external dissipation ( forcing ) the above consideration can be still valid . in this case the exact invariance of the total number of particles @xmath64 can be replaced by its adiabatic invariance ( similarly to the enstrophy ) and the inequalities similar to the eq.(14 ) can be made .",
    "due to linearity of the dissipation ( forcing ) these inequalities will be still invariant to the rescaling : @xmath53",
    ".    there exists another way to tackle the problem .",
    "the wave function can be considered as a vector on the complex plane .",
    "the density : @xmath19 , gives magnitude of the vector , whereas the phase gives its direction .",

    "<S> coherent properties of the baryon - photon fluid decoupling are considered in the terms of an effective nonlinear schrdinger equation for a macroscopic wave function that specifies the index of the coherent state . </S>",
    "<S> generation of a transitional acoustic turbulence preceding formation of large - scale condensate in the plasma and its influence on the cmb power spectrum has been studied . </S>",
    "<S> a scaling @xmath0 law is derived for the cmb doppler spectrum @xmath1 ( angle - averaged ) in the _ wavenumber _ space , for sufficiently large wavenumber @xmath2 and for the weak nonlinear and completely disordered initial conditions . using the recent wmap data it is shown that the so - called first acoustic peak represents ( in a compensated spectral form ) a pre - condensate fraction of the spectrum @xmath1 at a rather advance stage of the condensate formation process . </S>"
