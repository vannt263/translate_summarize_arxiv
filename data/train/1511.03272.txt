    "in the local universe , most massive star - forming galaxies have traditional hubble - type morphologies and relatively smooth and thin stellar disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these disks are thought to form from the cooling of baryons within dark matter halos ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "galaxy formation models ( both semi - analytic models , e.g. @xcite ; @xcite , and hydrodynamic simulations , e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) are able to reproduce realistic local disk galaxies . however , testing these specific models requires direct observations of galaxies throughout cosmic time .    over the past two decades",
    ", technological advances have enabled observations that provide new insights into the nature of star - forming galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts , in particular due to the combination of high - resolution multi - wavelength imaging with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and near - infrared integral - field spectroscopy with ground - based telescopes .",
    "the kinematics and structures of star - forming galaxies have been measured out to @xmath1 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the epoch during which the star formation rate ( sfr ) density in the universe is at its peak value . at this time",
    ", massive star - forming galaxies generally look very different from similar - mass star - forming galaxies today ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they tend to be smaller ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , morphologically clumpier ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , have thicker disks @xcite , and higher gas fractions ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "many massive star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 do have rotating disks  similar to their local counterparts  but tend to have higher velocity dispersions ( and therefore lower @xmath10 , i.e. the ratio of rotation to velocity dispersion ) than local star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the higher velocity dispersions at higher redshifts are thought to reflect increased turbulence and thickened disks ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical models suggest that the higher turbulence and clumpier morphology of massive star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 relative to their local counterparts are the result of the higher gas fractions ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and that the gas - rich , thicker disks are built - up by smooth , cold - mode gas accretion or minor mergers ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    however , the theoretical interpretation of the structures of distant star - forming galaxies is complicated by observational limitations , including low spatial resolution and small sample sizes . for example , initial studies with sinfoni found that one third ( 14 of 47 ) of star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 appeared to be small and dispersion dominated ( i.e. , @xmath12 ; @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , @xcite revealed that objects that do not show evidence for rotation in the lower resolution observations , especially objects with sizes close to the previous resolution limit , do show evidence for rotation in follow - up adaptive - optics assisted ifu observations .",
    "thus , small rotationally - supported galaxies may appear to be dispersion dominated because of smearing caused by resolution limitations .",
    "new near - infrared ( nir ) spectrographs , including kmos @xcite and mosfire @xcite have multiplexing capabilities , and thus allow for extensive kinematic studies of large , complete samples of galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "however , as both kmos and mosfire are seeing limited , kinematic measurements of the majority of the star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 with @xmath13 will suffer from the same resolution problem as the seeing - limited sinfoni studies .",
    "additionally , multi - slit spectrographs like mosfire have no ifu and a constant position angle for all slits in one mask .",
    "the mask orientation is generally set by the algorithm to maximize the number of targets in a mask , and thus the slit position angle is randomly oriented compared to the galaxy major axes .",
    "the random slit orientations introduce additional challenges to interpreting the observed kinematic information .    despite these complications , we can take advantage of the large galaxy surveys afforded by multi - object nir spectrographs by combining these observations with high - resolution rest - frame optical imaging from _ hst_. ancillary _",
    "hst_/wfc3 data accurately show what portion of a galaxy falls within the slit , and can be used to interpret the observed spectrum .",
    "furthermore , by using large galaxy samples with detailed ancillary measurements , we can apply statistical approaches to constrain the kinematic structures of galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite use the distribution of observed axis ratios to constrain the structures of star - forming galaxies .",
    "in this paper we study the dynamical and baryonic masses and kinematic structures of a sample of 178 star - forming galaxies using data from the mosfire deep evolution field ( mosdef ) survey @xcite .",
    "the galaxies are observed with random orientations between the slit and kinematic major axes , and rotation is detected in only 35 galaxies .",
    "however , for the galaxies without detected rotation we take advantage of our large sample size , accurate @xmath0sfrs , stellar masses and detailed morphological information from imaging of the candels survey ( @xcite , @xcite ) to constrain their kinematics .",
    "we derive dynamical masses for all galaxies , compare them with baryonic masses , and discuss the implications for the structures of the galaxies , the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and dark matter fraction , and the gas kinematics of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) host galaxies .",

    "the position - velocity diagrams of the 35 galaxies with detected rotation are shown in appendix  [ sec : appendix_pv ] .",
    "for all objects without resolved rotation ( see section [ sec : rot_meas ] ) , we measure the kinematics from the 1d spectra . as our sample",

    "this method is discussed in detail in appendix  [ sec : appendix1d ] . in summary , we model each object as an inclined disk ( using the galfit structural parameters @xmath24 , @xmath23 , @xmath25 ) , with the major axis offset from the slit by @xmath78 . the rotation and velocity dispersion kinematics are included by assuming a fixed ratio of @xmath3 , and then the model is convolved to match the mosfire seeing resolution .",

    "we consider whether this is a reasonable assumption by considering the necessary conditions to observe rotation in a galaxy .",
    "one reason why intrinsic rotation may not be observable is that the galaxy is small with respect to the seeing size .",
    "if there is only one resolution element across the galaxy disk , then any rotation signature will be washed out and we would only observe velocity dispersion . additionally , the galaxy major axes may be misaligned with the slit axis . a position angle ( pa ) offset",
    "reduces the ability to detect rotation , as for more misaligned objects , the rotational information is projected into fewer resolution elements along the slit . at the most extreme ,",
    "if a galaxy is completely misaligned with the slit ( i.e. @xmath96 ) , the rotational signature is collapsed into the same resolution element , and again we would only observe a velocity dispersion .",
    "we consider the dual effects of object size and @xmath78 , by calculating how much of the stellar light major axis falls within the slit , projected along the slit direction .",
    "the projected size of the object falling within the slit ( @xmath97 ) should be larger than the seeing for the object to be spatially resolved , or @xmath98 .",
    "we divide our sample into four categories , based on combination of the projected spatial resolution criterion given above ( resolved vs. unresolved ) and whether we detect rotation or not ( rotation vs. dispersion , see section  [ sec : rot_meas ] ) .",
    "this classification scheme gives 15 spatially resolved galaxies with observed rotation , 20 spatially unresolved galaxies with observed rotation , 20 spatially resolved galaxies with only dispersion observed , and 123 spatially unresolved galaxies with only dispersion observed . in figures [ fig : sample_pstamps ] & [ fig : sample_spectra ] we show example _ hst _ images and spectra , respectively , for objects in each category .",
    "we show pa offset versus object size ( @xmath24 ) as a function of seeing in figure [ fig : galfit_params ] . at fixed @xmath24 ,",
    "we tend to have more `` dispersion - only '' objects and fewer objects with detected rotation as the position angle offset increases from aligned ( @xmath99 ) to completely misaligned ( @xmath100 )",
    ". we also note that on average , galaxies for which we observe rotation tend to be larger than those without observed rotation .",
    "this finding supports the possibility that we may not observe rotation for some objects simply because they are physically too small to resolve , even if there is no position angle offset between the semi - major axis and the slit .",
    "we can also see these trends in figure  [ fig : sample_pstamps ] , as the objects with observed rotation ( left panels ) tend to have better alignment between their major axes and the slit , and tend to have larger angular sizes relative to the objects for which we only observe dispersion ( right panels ) .",
    "however , not all objects follow the expected classifications .",
    "for instance , we observe rotation for some spatially unresolved objects .",
    "these galaxies are shown as yellow diamonds in figure [ fig : galfit_params ] , with example images and spectra shown in the lower left panels of figures [ fig : sample_pstamps ] and [ fig : sample_spectra ] . also ,",
    "if all galaxies in our sample are intrinsically disk galaxies and have at least partial rotational support , we would expect to see rotation in all objects that are spatially resolved .",
    "yet we do not observe rotation in some of the galaxies that meet the projected spatial resolution criterion , which are shown as green triangles in figure  [ fig : galfit_params ] , with examples in the upper right panels of figures [ fig : sample_pstamps ] and [ fig : sample_spectra ] .",
    "other effects may influence the classification of our sample into these four sub - samples , which could explain why we see objects in the unexpected classification categories .",
    "first , the position angle offset between the kinematic major axis and the slit could be incorrect",
    ". this error may be due to uncertainties in the photometric major axis position angle estimation or to a misalignment between the kinematic and photometric major axes .",
    "the latter effect has been observed by @xcite in galaxies at @xmath1 , and possibly indicates disturbed kinematics due to mergers @xcite . if the position angle offset is incorrect , our projected size along the major axis may not match the true intrinsic projected size of the region that we probe with the kinematics .",
    "thus objects may scatter from the `` spatially resolved '' category into the `` spatially unresolved '' category or vice versa .",
    "second , we use the rest - frame optical @xmath39 in this classification , but we measure the kinematics from @xmath0emission .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : light_profiles ] that the rest - frame optical and @xmath0sizes of the galaxies with detected rotation are very similar , so using @xmath39to determine spatial resolution is a reasonable approximation .",
    "still , if an object is close to the detection limit , small differences between @xmath39and @xmath0size could change the spatial resolution classification .",
    "third , we do not incorporate inclination angle in our classification procedure . for face - on galaxies",
    ", we do not expect to detect rotation . if we consider galaxies with @xmath101 ( i.e. , @xmath102 , assuming @xmath103 ) to be face - on , only 5 of our galaxies satisfy this criterion , three of which have detected rotation , and two of which had been classified as `` spatially resolved '' .",
    "fourth , we rely on single - component galfit fits to determine the photometric position angle , axis ratio @xmath25 , and stellar effective radius @xmath39 .",
    "our galaxies often exhibit clumps , so they are not perfectly fit by a smooth srsic profile . furthermore , galfit is unable to recover extreme inclination angles ( i.e. , close to edge - on or face - on ; @xcite ) .",
    "these limitations could further influence the accuracy of the position angle , effective radius , and axis ratio , and could influence whether an individual galaxy is categorized as `` spatially resolved '' or not .",

    "instead , we assume that the ionized gas and stellar mass have the same distribution and that the gas follows the gravitational potential of the galaxy .    when using kinematic models to measure rotation and interpret the velocity dispersion of unresolved objects , we weight the model velocity field by a luminosity distribution .",
    "for the galaxies with detected rotation , this weighting determines the composite velocity profile within a spatial slice , as there is a mix of line - of - sight velocity components , as well as components that fall within the slit , parallel to the spatial direction .",
    "the weighting also predicts a light profile along the spatial direction , but our method of fitting the 2d spectra with the models removes this variation in the spatial direction through the scaling factor @xmath212 . for the kinematically unresolved galaxies",
    ", the luminosity weighting affects all directions .    to be fully consistent ,",
    "we should weight the model velocities by the @xmath0light profile , so there are no mis - matches between the model and observed luminosity profiles . however , the @xmath0profiles are not well constrained by the mosdef data , and most galaxies in our sample lie at redshifts where @xmath0falls outside of the wavelength coverage of the wfc3 grism @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume that the stellar light profiles are a reasonable approximation for the luminosity weighting .",
    "we assess this assumption by comparing the stellar light profiles with the @xmath0profiles for the galaxies with detected rotation .    to measure the stellar light profile , we convolve the _ hst_/f160w image to match the seeing resolution of the corresponding mosfire spectrum",
    "we then collapse all light falling within the slit along the slit direction .",
    "we approximate the @xmath0profile by collapsing the scaled emission line model , @xmath213 , over the wavelength direction .",

    "the @xmath0fwhm is measured from the scaled 2d emission line model , and the f160w fwhm is measured from the f160w image within the slit , convolved to match the mosfire seeing conditions .",
    "the dashed grey line shows the line of equality .",
    "the grey shaded region shows the range of values when @xmath215 is 10% smaller or larger than @xmath214 .",
    "the fwhms are similar for most of the galaxies with detected rotation .",
    "also , all but a few of the galaxies lie below the relation @xmath216 found by @xcite , with the converted fwhms convolved with a median seeing fwhm of @xmath217 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we quantify the profile differences for all galaxies with detected rotation by fitting the @xmath0and f160w profiles with gaussians .",
    "we note that the profiles of a number of objects are not well - described by a gaussian profile , but the fwhm measurements should provide a reasonable , albeit rough , comparison .",
    "we compare the widths of the seeing - matched stellar light and @xmath0profiles in figure  [ fig : fwhm_comparison ] .",
    "generally , the fwhms are in reasonable agreement , and only a few objects have fwhms that differ by more than 10% ( objects lying outside the grey shaded region ) . additionally , we show the relation @xmath216 found by @xcite as the dotted grey line , converted to fwhms and convolved with a median seeing fwhm of @xmath217 .",
    "all but a few of the galaxies lie below this line , suggesting that the @xmath0sizes for our sample are closer to the stellar light sizes than for the @xcite sample .",
    "thus , for most of our objects the stellar light profile is a reasonable substitute for the @xmath0profile , and hence the measured kinematics will not be biased .",
    "however , for galaxies with more extended @xmath0 , such as aegis-17437 , we may overestimate the velocity dispersion and possibly the rotation velocity , when assuming the stellar light profile in the model construction .",
    "this velocity difference can be explained by the fact that the high velocities at large radii have been down - weighted when using the less extended stellar light instead of the @xmath0profile .",
    "the exact changes in the measured velocity and dispersion velocity from the 2d models depend on the misalignment between the major axis and the slit .",
    "if @xmath218 , there is symmetric mixing of velocities at different radii within a spatial slice , and the narrower stellar light profile therefore results in less broadening in the wavelength direction .",
    "additionally , by weighting with the narrower stellar light profile , the composite of the velocity components along the line - of - sight direction also results in less broadening in the wavelength direction .",
    "thus , when @xmath218 and we weight the velocity fields with the stellar light profile , the measured @xmath61 is the same , and @xmath60 is larger than we would measure when using the @xmath0light profile . if a galaxy is misaligned with the slit , the measured @xmath61 using the stellar light profile may also be larger than if we weighted with the @xmath0profile .    the 1d model for aegis-17437 would suffer a greater discrepancy if we would have weighted the velocities of the model with the @xmath0 instead of the stellar light profile .",
    "the increased weight at large radii would increase the weighted integrated velocity dispersion of the model within the aperture .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath219 is higher for the @xmath0profile than for the stellar light profile , when using the same underlying rotation curve and assumed @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the corrected rms velocity values measured using the stellar light profile overestimate the true values .",
    "an additional question is whether the stellar light sizes correctly probe the characteristic size of the underlying matter density profile . in particular",
    ", our current calculations have assumed that half of the total mass is enclosed within the half - light radius . however , the half - mass sizes are on average @xmath220 smaller than the half - light sizes @xcite .",
    "if we assume the same intrinsic rotation velocity curve , @xmath221 , and thus the measured @xmath61 ( for the resolved models ) and @xmath222 ( for the unresolved models ) are larger than the velocities at @xmath223 .",
    "if we assume a constant @xmath60 , this difference implies a lower @xmath10 . in combination with a smaller @xmath224 , this results in a considerably lower dynamical mass .",
    "for example , if @xmath225 is 25% lower than @xmath24 ( as in @xcite ) , then a galaxy with @xmath85 at @xmath24 and @xmath226 ( following @xcite , see appendix  [ sec : appendix1d ] ) has @xmath227 which is 31% lower than @xmath228 . when applying the correction found by @xcite the dynamical masses decline by 0.16 dex ( to @xmath229 ) and are inconsistent with both a @xcite and a @xcite imf .",
    "-5pt     we illustrate a lower limit of this systematic variation in the left panel of figure  [ fig : systematics ] , by approximating the changes of @xmath137 caused by varying @xmath230 and using @xmath231 ( i.e. , including variations to the rms velocity and virial coefficient with the assumption of an arctan curve with @xmath85 and @xmath226 ) .",
    "even @xmath232 changes in @xmath230 result in a @xmath232 change to the inferred dark matter fraction .",
    "however , if we instead assume a decreasing velocity dispersion with increasing radius , as we discuss in the next section , the @xmath233 values would be larger .",
    "this moves in the opposite direction as the above trend , and may change the masses so they remain consistent with a @xcite imf .      in this section",
    "we consider caveats to assumptions made in the preceding analysis .",
    "specifically , we focus on possible variations due to assumptions about the accuracy of the structural parameters , misalignment of the photometric and kinematic major axes , the intrinsic thickness of galaxy disks , the accuracy of our derived gas masses , the shape of the rotation curve , and the velocity dispersion profile being constant .",
    "first , we have not fully accounted for the accuracy of the galfit - derived structural parameters .",
    "we depend on the structural parameters to model the kinematics of the detected rotation curves , to correct the kinematics from integrated 1d spectra , and to calculate the dynamical masses .",
    "we include estimated errors on the effective radii when calculating the dynamical masses , but do not include any errors when fitting the kinematic models .",
    "thus , uncertainties in the structural parameters introduce scatter in our derived dynamical masses .",
    "second , for objects where the photometric and kinematic major axes are misaligned , the inferred velocities and dispersion velocities will be incorrect .",
    "if the true @xmath234 is closer to aligned , the corrected rms velocities will be over - estimated , while if it is more misaligned , the velocities will be under - estimated ( as seen in the first panel in figure  [ fig : aper_corr ] ) .",
    "we expect similar over- and under - estimates in the measured velocities and dispersions for the galaxies with detected rotation .",
    "additional misalignment uncertainties are introduced by slit alignment issues , which introduce the same trends as stated above .",
    "third , we assume an intrinsic disk thickness of @xmath235 to estimate inclination angles .",
    "if a galaxy is intrinsically thicker than the assumed value , the inferred inclination angle underestimates the true value . in this case , the inferred intrinsic rotation velocity and @xmath3 would be overestimated .",
    "if a galaxy is thinner , the inclination angle will be overestimated , producing an underestimate of both the rotation and @xmath3 .",
    "thus , variations in disk thickness within our sample will add scatter and a possible systematic offset in our dynamical masses .",
    "fourth , we assume that the galaxies in our sample follow the sfr - gas mass relation of @xcite for star - forming galaxies in the local universe . based on a local sample of normal and starburst galaxies , @xcite measure @xmath236 for @xmath237 , where @xmath35 includes both atomic and molecular gas .",
    "analysis of galaxies at @xmath238 find slopes that vary between @xmath239 @xcite and @xmath240 @xcite .",
    "these values bracket the local slope , so our gas masses may be reasonable .",
    "however , if the true slope is lower than the local relation , our gas masses underestimate the true value , while a higher slope implies our gas masses overestimate the true value . an alternate method would be to adopt the gas mass scaling relations presented in @xcite , which relate the gas mass to the stellar mass , the offset from the star - forming main sequence , and the redshift . if we adopt this scaling relation , we see an offset @xmath229 and a scatter of @xmath241 between the dynamical and baryonic masses , with the median mass difference lying in the unphysical region where @xmath242 .",
    "however , the gas mass scaling relations of @xcite were calibrated for uv+ir sfrs , while we use @xmath0sfrs in this work .",
    "mismatches between these sfr indicators could be causing the large ( @xmath243 ) difference between the inferred baryonic masses when using the scaling relation method and the inverted kennicutt - schmidt relation .",
    "as @xcite calibrated the @xmath244 relation using @xmath0sfrs , we opt to estimate the gas masses following this prescription .",
    "fifth , we have assumed that the rotation velocity profiles of our disk galaxies are well described by arctan models , as shown by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "some distant star - forming galaxies exhibit rotation following a freeman exponential disk model @xcite , as found by @xcite , while @xcite find indications of keplerian rotation in compact star - forming galaxies .",
    "however , preliminary analysis suggests that using an exponential disk rotation curve with our modeling produces poor fits to some of our galaxies .",
    "more detailed modeling is required to determine in detail whether an alternative rotation profile provides better agreement with our data and to assess the uncertainties introduced by this assumption .",
    "sixth , we have assumed that the intrinsic velocity dispersion is constant over all radii .",
    "however , the true velocity distribution may decrease with increasing radius , as seen in @xcite and @xcite . for the unresolved objects ,",
    "a decreasing velocity dispersion distribution would produce higher model rms velocities for a given @xmath3 measured at @xmath24 , in the outer portions of a galaxy , so taking @xmath245 in the case of a non - constant velocity profile should be a reasonable comparison , though may be higher than the true value depending on the exact form of the additional velocity dispersion term .",
    "this notation is in contrast to velocity dispersions of elliptical galaxies , where the _ central _ velocity dispersions are often denoted as @xmath161 or @xmath60 . ] as matching the same @xmath245 implies a higher central velocity dispersion , @xmath246 .",
    "a velocity dispersion profile which rises towards the center would increase the integrated model velocity dispersions but not the model rms velocity at @xmath39 , leading to lower corrected rms velocities and lower dynamical masses .",
    "the trend of decreasing integrated rms velocity with increasing inclination will also be less strong for a fixed @xmath3 than with a constant @xmath247 .",
    "the median @xmath3 required to remove the @xmath248 trend for the kinematically unresolved galaxies will therefore be higher , increasing the implied amount of rotational support relative to the random motions , which would indicate more settled or thinner disks .",
    "preliminary calculations assuming an additional dispersion term that rises towards the center of a galaxy confirms these general trends , but more careful analysis is necessary to determine the correct form of a rising velocity dispersion profile .",
    "seventh , in our derivation of the dynamical masses we have not included the systematic uncertainties arising from the choice of virial coefficients , @xmath249 and @xmath250 . the matter distributions assumed when deriving the virial coefficients may not match the underlying profiles of the star - forming galaxies in our sample , but more detailed analysis is required to quantify the uncertainties introduced by the adopted virial coefficients .",
    "we note that the systematic shifts from a different choice of virial coefficient can be non - negligible , and have implications especially for the imf constraints .",
    "for instance , the combination of @xmath251 ( from @xcite ) , @xmath252 , and @xmath85 would have resulted in dynamical masses that are larger by @xmath253 and an inferred dark matter fraction of @xmath254 .",
    "we approximate the systematic changes due to changing only the combined @xmath255 in the right panel of figure  [ fig : systematics ] . in this plot",
    ", we see that if we assume @xmath256 for all galaxies ( without changing the conversion from the integrated velocity dispersions to the rms velocities for the unresolved galaxies ) , then the median @xmath257 , which lies in the unphysical region where @xmath185 . if we instead assume @xmath258 ( again with no other changes )",
    ", we would instead infer a much higher dark matter fraction of @xmath259 rather than the @xmath260 measured from the default assumptions .",
    "in this paper , we use spectra from the mosdef survey to study the masses and kinematic structures of a sample of 178 star - forming galaxies at @xmath261 . for all galaxies , structural parameters from candels _",
    "hst_/f160w imaging , stellar masses from multi - wavelength photometry , and gas masses from dust - corrected @xmath0sfrs and the relation by @xcite are available .",
    "the gas kinematics have been measured from the @xmath262 emission lines : for 35 of the galaxies we detect resolved rotation , while in the remaining 143 galaxies we only measure the velocity dispersion .    as our galaxies are observed with random orientations compared to the slit angle",
    ", we may not see rotation for some objects that are intrinsically rotating .",
    "additionally , we may not resolve rotation due to seeing limitations , as found by @xcite . to estimate how many of our galaxies are consistent with rotation ,",
    "we compare the projected @xmath0major axis size within the slit to the seeing and use this to estimate whether a galaxy is spatially resolved or not .",
    "the majority of our sample ( 80% ) is too small relative to our seeing , and thus these galaxies may indeed be unresolved rotating disks",
    ".    we have developed models to convert the observed kinematic measurements into intrinsic rotation and dispersion velocities .",
    "these models use the sizes , srsic indices , axis ratios , and position angles measured from the f160w imaging to simultaneously account for the inclination of the galaxy , the misalignment of photometric major axis and the slit , and determine which portions of the galaxy fall within the slit . in the case of galaxies with detected rotation , we directly constrain @xmath61 and @xmath60 , and find a median @xmath131_{\\mathrm{2d , median } } = 2.1 $ ] . for the galaxies without observed rotation ,",
    "the models allow us to convert the observed velocity dispersion into an rms velocity for an assumed ratio of @xmath3 .",
    "when assuming that the galaxies with and without detected rotation have a similar @xmath10 , we find that the baryonic ( @xmath263 ) and dynamical masses of the total sample are in good agreement , with a median offset of @xmath264 and a scatter of @xmath138 .",
    "moreover , we directly constrain the mean @xmath3 for the galaxies without detected rotation by removing any trend of @xmath187 with axis ratio @xmath25 and find @xmath131_{\\mathrm{1d , median}}=2.1_{-0.3}^{+0.2}$ ] .",
    "the offset between the dynamical and baryonic masses implies a dark matter fraction within @xmath39of 8% for a @xcite imf , which is lower than the value measured within @xmath203 for local star - forming galaxies @xcite or within @xmath265 for galaxies at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the consistency between the dynamical and baryonic masses relies on the inclusion of gas masses .",
    "when comparing the dynamical masses with only stellar masses , we find a larger scatter ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "furthermore , the median offset between the stellar and dynamical mass increases with increasing @xmath0ssfr , which is suggestive of a larger gas fraction at higher ssfrs .",
    "we examine trends in the ratio of support from rotation and random motions , @xmath10 , as a function of @xmath0ssfr and stellar mass . for galaxies",
    "without detected rotation , we bin by @xmath0ssfr and stellar mass and estimate @xmath10 by removing any variation of @xmath187 with axis ratio .",
    "we see a trend of decreasing @xmath10 with increasing @xmath0ssfr and a possible weak trend of increasing @xmath10 with increasing stellar mass when combining our measurements with the sample by @xcite",
    ". the trend of decreasing @xmath10 with increasing @xmath0ssfr may reflect disk settling , such that galaxies with lower ssfrs have lower gas fractions and therefore lower velocity dispersions .",
    "while our assumption that all galaxies without detected rotation are disks results in highly consistent dynamical and baryonic masses , we also find a strong correspondence between the two masses if we had instead assumed that all unresolved galaxies are dispersion dominated .",
    "differences in the methods of calculating the dynamical masses ( i.e. , using circularized radii for early - type galaxies vs. inclination corrections for disks , different virial coefficients ) may explain why the dynamical masses are so similar , and why there is no observed trend of @xmath187 with axis ratio .",
    "the measured masses also provide insight into the stellar imf in @xmath1 star - forming galaxies .",
    "the baryonic and dynamical masses of our sample are consistent with a @xcite imf .",
    "a @xcite imf is disfavored by our data , as it would lead to baryonic masses that exceed the dynamical masses by @xmath266 on average .",
    "however , when assuming that the half - mass sizes are 25% smaller than the half - light sizes @xcite , the inferred masses are also inconsistent with a @xcite imf .",
    "nonetheless , other systematic uncertainties , as discussed in detail in the discussion section , may reduce this mass difference .",
    "we examine the modified @xmath162-@xmath190and @xmath162-@xmath136tully fisher relations ( tfrs ) for our sample of galaxies , with @xmath267 .",
    "we find a higher intercept of @xmath162 than @xcite measure for the average @xmath197 tfr at @xmath268 , which may be caused by a decrease in the average gas fraction of star - forming galaxies with time . for the @xmath269 tfr , we measure a lower intercept than @xcite find at @xmath200 .",
    "the change in the @xmath270-tfr may reflect an increase in the average dark matter fraction with time , possibly caused by the increase in average galaxy size at fixed mass with decreasing redshift .",
    "our sample also contains 21 agn , selected by either x - ray luminosity , irac colors , or optical line ratios .",
    "as the line emission may be associated with nuclear accretion activity , the broadening may not only probe the kinematics of the host galaxy .",
    "we measure the baryonic and dynamical masses for the agn in our sample , and find that they follow the same trend as the star - forming galaxies .",
    "this finding suggests that on average the line profiles do indeed reflect the host galaxy kinematics .",
    "this paper demonstrates the power of using large samples of galaxies observed with multi - object near - infrared spectrographs under seeing - limited conditions to study the average kinematic properties of high redshift galaxies .",
    "in particular , combining such observations with high - resolution imaging makes it possible to model the effects of axis misalignment , seeing , and velocity rotation and dispersion on the observed spectra .",
