    "@xcite that the _",

    "more importantly , the previous work @xcite dealt with this two - body system @xmath8 in the formalism of quantum mechanics and the potential between two heavy mesons was constructed in perturbation theory .",

    "composed of two vector fields of arbitrary spin and definite parity has been given @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we apply the general formalism to investigate the molecular state of @xmath8 and consider that the effective interaction between these two heavy mesons is derived from one light vector meson exchange . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have deduced that in our approach one light pseudoscalar meson exchange has no contribution to the potential between two heavy vector mesons .",
    "because of the su(3 ) symmetry of the light vector mesons , one strange meson ( @xmath10 ) exchange should be considered . from one strange meson exchange ,",

    "as well known , the nonperturbative contribution plays an important role in the case of qcd at low energy .",
    "it is necessary to note that the more nonperturbative effects should be taken into account when we investigate the light meson interaction with quark in the heavy meson . in this work ,",
    "we introduce the operator product expansion and obtain the heavy meson bs wave function including the contribution from the condensates of vacuum . from the improved heavy meson bs wave function ,",
    "we can obtain the heavy meson form factors which contain the contribution from the nonperturbative effects of qcd . through these further form factors",
    "we can obtain the heavy meson interaction with light meson and the potentials between two heavy vector mesons without an extra parameter .",
    "obviously , this approach is closer to qcd than our previous works @xcite .",
