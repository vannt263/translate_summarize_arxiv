    "the gauge sector of the standard model ( sm ) , has been extensively tested by lep , sld and tevatron experiments . among these tests ,",

    "the gauge boson pair production can also reveal the nature of the triple gauge coupling , but until now there is no evidence of the existence of anomalous gauge couplings .",
    "in fact , the analysis of the @xmath11 transverse momentum distribution in the process @xmath12 ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 are electrons and muons ) at tevatron ( @xmath15 gev ) gives a more restrict limit on the @xmath16 coupling parameters @xcite .",

    "for example , the @xmath0 production in linear and hadron colliders was analyzed in some extensions of the sm which have the same gauge boson content but where the fundamental matter representation includes new exotic fermions ( very massive leptons and heavy quarks ) @xcite ; using the unitarity constraint the authors determined some relations between model parameters @xcite . in the same context",

    "we are exploring the phenomenological aspects of an alternative to the sm based on the @xmath27 gauge symmetry ( 3 - 3 - 1 model ) @xcite which predicts new very massive particles mixed to the observed states .",
    "together with the exotic fermion content and an extra neutral gauge boson , the model includes gauge bosons carrying lepton number equal 2 , called bilepton @xcite , that also occur in @xmath28 grand unified theories @xcite . there",

    "let us outline some features of the model considered in this paper .",
    "although at low energies the model coincides with the sm , it offers an explanation for basic questions such as the family replication problem and the observed bound for the weinberg angle @xcite .",
    "the family problem is solved by considering the model anomaly cancellation procedure , requiring that the number of fermion families must be a multiple of the quark color number @xcite . considering",
    "that qcd asymptotic freedom condition is valid only if the number of families of quarks is less than five , one concludes that there are three generations . on the other hand , to keep the validity of perturbation calculation , one obtains a bound for the weinberg angle at each energy scale @xmath29 , ( @xmath30 ) this constraint follows from the coupling constants ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) ratio .",
    "the experimental value of @xmath33 leads to an upper bound associated with the spontaneous @xmath7 symmetry breaking @xcite , which implies directly on a restriction on exotic boson masses @xcite .",
    "working with two versions of the 3 - 3 - 1 model , we have analyzed the @xmath34 , ( where @xmath35 denotes ordinary leptons or quarks ) for ilc energies in order to establish some signatures of the extra neutral gauge boson @xmath4 existence and to obtain lower bounds on its mass .",
    "the obtained bounds were confirmed by extending our analysis to @xmath36 and @xmath37 collisions @xcite . in another publication , we have included the @xmath4 contribution to the production of a pair of double charged bileptons in @xmath38 for ilc energy @xcite .",
    "the beginning of activities of the lhc , operating at high energy , opens the search for new discoveries . among these findings",
    "one expect the presence of some signatures for new particles as those predicted by the 3 - 3 - 1 model , in particular new gauge bosons , bileptons and exotic quarks .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze the production of a pair of single charged bilepton ( @xmath5 ) at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern with @xmath39 tev , through the process @xmath40 , where @xmath9 channel contributions come from @xmath41 , @xmath11 and @xmath42 and where @xmath10 channel includes only the exotic quarks contributions .",
    "our calculation is performed at the tree level employing parton distribution functions @xcite in a monte carlo code .    in the section",
    "ii we review the basic aspects of the minimal version of the 3 - 3 - 1 model . in the section",
    "iii we present the calculation of @xmath43 cross section as well as the final results for @xmath44 adding some comments of our results .",
    "finally , in the section iv , we present the conclusions of our work .",
    "in the 3 - 3 - 1 model the electric charge operator is defined as : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are two of the eight generators satisfying the @xmath48 algebra @xmath49 = i f_{i , j , k } t_k",
    "\\quad i , j , k = 1 .. 8,\\ ] ] @xmath50 is the unit matrix and @xmath51 denotes the @xmath52 charge .    the electric charge operator determines how the fields are arranged in each representation and depends on the @xmath53 parameter . among the possible choices",
    ", @xmath54 @xcite corresponds to the minimal version of the model that is used in the present application .",
    "the lepton content of each generation ( @xmath55 ) is : @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the charge conjugate of @xmath58 ( @xmath59 , @xmath29 , @xmath60 ) field . here",
    "the values in the parentheses denote quantum numbers relative to @xmath61 , @xmath7 and @xmath62 transformations .    in order to cancel anomalies ,",
    "the first quark family is accommodated in @xmath7 triplet and the second and third families ( @xmath63 ) belong to the anti - triplet representation , as follows : @xmath64 @xmath65    where @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are exotic quarks with respectively @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath71 units of the positron charge ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this version has five additional gauge bosons beyond the sm ones .",
    "they are : a neutral @xmath42 and four heavy charged bileptons , @xmath72 with lepton number @xmath73 . in order to avoid model anomalies ,",
    "only one quark family must be assigned to a different @xmath48 representation , but this procedure does not specify what is the family to be elected @xcite .",
    "we will comment , in the conclusion section , about the consequences of our choice where the first family is treated differently from the other two .    the minimum higgs structure necessary for symmetry breaking and that gives quark and lepton acceptable masses",
    "are composed by three triplets ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) and one anti - sextet ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the neutral field of each scalar triplet develops non zero vacuum expectation values ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 ) and the breaking of 3 - 3 - 1 group to the sm is produced by the following hierarchical pattern : @xmath82 the consistency of the model with the sm phenomenology is imposed by fixing a large scale for @xmath78 , responsible to give mass to the exotic particles ( @xmath83 ) , with @xmath84 gev@xmath85 .    in the minimal version ,",
    "the relation between @xmath42 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 masses @xcite is : @xmath88 this special constraint respects the experimental bounds that , even being a consequence of the model , is not often used in the literature .",
    "we keep this relation through our calculations .",
    "for example , this ratio is @xmath89 for @xmath90 @xcite , so that @xmath91 can decays into a bilepton pair .",
    "the interactions of quarks and neutral gauge bosons are described by the lagrangian : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the quark electric charge and @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the quark vector and axial - vector couplings with @xmath11 and @xmath91 respectively .",
    "as referred before , in the 3 - 3 - 1 model , one family must transform with respect to @xmath48 rotations differently to the other two .",
    "this requirement manifests itself when we collect the quark currents in a part with universal coupling with @xmath42 similar to the sm and another part corresponding to the non - diagonal @xmath42 couplings .",
    "the transformation of these non diagonal terms , in the mass eigenstates basis , leads to the flavor changing neutral lagrangian @xmath98 where @xmath99 the mixing matrices @xmath100 ( for _ up_-type quark ) and @xmath101 ( for _ down_-type quark ) , that give raise to the quark masses , come from the yukawa lagrangian and are related to the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix , as @xmath102    by convention , in the sm , it is usual to assume that for _ up_-type quark the gauge interaction eigenstates are the same as the mass eigenstates , which corresponds to @xmath103 .",
    "this assumption is not valid in the 3 - 3 - 1 model because , in accordance to the renormalization group equations ( rge ) , all matrix elements evolve with energy and are unstable against radiative corrections .",
    "it turns out that @xmath104 must be @xmath105 . as the eq .",
    "( 9 ) is independent of representation , one is free to choose which quark family representation must be different from the other two .",
    "we recall that our choice was for the first family to belong to the triplet @xmath48 representation . in the next section",
    "we will discuss the consequences of our choice .",

    "in this paper we focus on the bilepton ( @xmath121 ) pair production in @xmath2 collision at lhc .",
    "this particle is predicted in many extensions of the sm and in particular in the 3 - 3 - 1 model used in the present paper .",
    "we restrict our calculation to a version of the model where the bilepton mass is related to the mass of the extra neutral gauge boson @xmath42 , also predicted in the model . for the range of the extra neutral gauge boson mass considered here , the dominant @xmath121 decay is leptonic ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the hadronic channel ( @xmath123 ) will open when @xmath124 tev , associated with a bilepton heavier than @xmath125 gev . for the elementary drell - yan process , there are the contributions of @xmath41 , @xmath11 , and @xmath42 in the s - channel and the exotic quark in the t - channel .",
    "@xmath67 is exchanged when the initial quark of colliding proton is an up - type quark , but when the down - type quark is participating , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are exchanged .",
    "this is a consequence of our choice for family quark representation .",
    "the correct high energy behavior of the elementary cross section follows from the balance between the individual contributions . in order to emphasize the role of the exotic quark contribution , we present in the figure",
    "5 the `` bad '' behavior of the elementary cross section in the absence of the t - channel contribution for a fixed @xmath42 mass , we see clearly that the @xmath126 sub - process violates `` softly '' the unitarity bound and @xmath127 leads to a more severe violation . as expected , the @xmath127 process is more sensitive than @xmath126 , because this channel receives additional exotic quark contribution .    when considering the t - channel contribution we take into account the mixing of quark mass eigenstates originated from the yukawa coupling . in this work",
    "we have obtained a set of mixing parameters allowing to a good behavior for the elementary cross section , for different @xmath128 .",
    "these parameters are related to our particular choice for @xmath7 family representation .",
    "this result does not exclude any other choice for quark representation .    in the 3 - 3 - 1 model ,",
    "@xmath42 couples to the quarks in a non universal way leading to the existence of flavor changing vertices . as a consequence , the quark mixing parameters are also present in @xmath42 quark vertices .",
    "we display in the tables i and ii our results for the flavor changing couplings .    in order to obtain the total cross section for the production of bilepton pairs we employed the cut on the final particle pseudo - rapidity . considering a conservative integrated luminosity value and @xmath129 tev we predict the production of a thousand of @xmath130 gev pairs mainly due to the contribution from @xmath131 tev . for @xmath132",
    "tev the same number of events is obtained for @xmath133 gev pairs , associated to a @xmath134 tev .",
    "one can ask about the possibility of tevatron to find a large amount of bileptons .",
    "in fact , as our prediction lies on a large @xmath128 ( greater than @xmath135 gev ) , the required energy _ per _ quark for an individual sub - process @xmath136 would be larger than @xmath137 gev not available at tevatron , where the energy beam is about @xmath138 gev .",
    "for this reason the tevatron gives @xmath139 gev .",
    "finally , we observe that it is possible to distinguish the leptons coming from bileptons with those from the background of @xmath8 decay .",
    "in contrast with @xmath140 which decays into @xmath141 @xmath13 , the charged lepton coming from the bilepton decay has a large transverse momentum .",
    "a useful @xmath142 cut can eliminate this sm background .",
