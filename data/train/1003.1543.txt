    "flavor mixing plays a central role in the physics of flavors . for quarks ,",
    "the ckm ( @xmath0 ) matrix has stood the test of time and is found to be sufficient in describing all of the relevant physics .",
    "similarly , the pmns ( @xmath1 ) matrix has been used to analyze neutrino oscillation with no known discrepancies .",
    "mathematically , both matrices belong to elements of @xmath2 , the @xmath3 unitary matrices .",
    "physically , for quarks , since the phases of individual quark states are unobservable , the rephasing transformation , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are arbitrary phase matrices , leaves the physics unchanged .",
    "thus , only the rephasing invariant",
    "part of @xmath0 is physical . for @xmath1 , while the charged lepton phases are unobservable , for majorana neutrinos actually there are two observable , cp - violating , phases @xcite .",
    "however , as long as one restricts oneself to lepton number conserving processes , such as in neutrino oscillations , these phases also become unphysical so that the physical @xmath1 is again rephasing invariant .    related to the rephasing invariance of mixing matrices",
    "is their parametrization .",
    "while it may appear that the choice of parametrization is not important , since , at the end of the day , the physical quantities must be grouped into rephasing invariant combinations . however , when one deals with a situation where relations between parameters are considered , a particular choice may be advantageous over others .",
    "for instance , when the mixing depends on the energy scale , as in the rge for mass matrices , we have a set of evolution equations relating parameters at neighboring scales . another example deals with neutrino mixing in matter . here",
    ", the mixing depends on the density of matter and neutrino energy , contributing to an induced neutrino mass .",
    "one can establish the relation between parameters for neighboring densities , resulting in a set of evolution equations as a function of the neutrino effective mass .",
    "they are very similar to those of the energy scale as described by a set of rge .",
    "it turns out that , in both cases , the use of explicitly rephasing invariant parameters simplifies the evolution equations .    in the following",
    "we will derive a set of evolution equations , as a function of the effective mass of neutrinos , for neutrino parameters in matter .",
    "these equations are based on the use of rephasing invariant parameters developed earlier .",
    "we find that they have simple , analytic , albeit approximate , solutions .",
    "it is interesting that the parameters in matter preserve a number of salient features of those in vacuum , resulting in a matter - dependent pmns matrix that can be grasped at a glance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is a brief summary of the rephasing invariant parametrization that is adopted in this work . in stead of directly solving the eigenvalue problem ,",
    "we derive in section iii the evolution equations for the neutrino mixing parameters and masses from the effective hamiltonian in matter .",
    "certain well - known invariants are also derived using the symmetric properties of the equations .",
    "section iv is devoted first to solving the two - flavor problem using this rephasing invariant formulation , and then the three - flavor case . making use of the known properties of measured neutrino parameters , analytic , approximate ,",
    "solutions are obtained . in section",
    "v , the accuracy of the solutions are confirmed by comparison with numerical integration of the equations .",
