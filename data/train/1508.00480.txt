    "excitons in bulk semiconductors and heterostructures have been under intensive study for many years since their discovery in 1952  @xcite .",
    "one of the important characteristics of an exciton is the binding energy caused by the coulomb interaction of the electron and the hole  @xcite .",
    "although in bulk semiconductors this energy is relatively small , typically lower than the lattice vibration energy at room temperature , in the semiconductor heterostructures it can increase significantly , up to four times  @xcite . together with the binding energy , the radiative properties of an exciton are characterized by another important parameter , the radiative decay rate  @xcite or the oscillator strength  @xcite , which is defined by the exciton - light coupling . since the discovery of the giant exciton oscillator strength ( the rashba effect  @xcite )",
    ", the exciton states and exciton - light coupling have been drawing much attention , see , for example , refs .",
    "recent developments of the microcavities  @xcite open up new frontiers for controlling the exciton - light coupling efficiency .",
    "precise experimental determination of the exciton binding energy is a quite complicated problem  @xcite .",
    "the exciton transition can be shifted and broadened due to defects and roughness of the interfaces in a heterostructure .",
    "the edge of optical transitions between uncoupled electron and hole is usually inexplicit , therefore the spectroscopic determination of the exciton binding energy leads to significant uncertainties .",
    "the most accurate methods seem to be a spectroscopic study of optical transitions to different exciton states ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , ... ) .",
    "the experimental study of exciton - light coupling and quantitative determination of its characteristics are also a nontrivial problem .",
    "the coupling gives rise to an energy shift and a radiative broadening of exciton lines  @xcite , which can be , in principle , measured using , e.g. , the steady - state reflectance spectroscopy , see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein . this approach , however , is applicable only for the high - quality heterostructures when the non - radiative processes do not dominate over the radiative one .",
    "another approach is the time - resolved spectroscopy using photoluminescence kinetics , pump - probe , or four - wave mixing methods for determination of the radiative decay time , see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite .",
    "similar problems appear in this approach if the quality of the heterostructure is not high enough .",
    "the theoretical modeling of the exciton in a bulk semiconductor is usually carried out in the framework of the hydrogen model  @xcite . in this model , the motion of an exciton as a whole and relative motion of the electron and the hole are separated that leads to the two independent schrdinger equations ( ses ) for the center - of - mass and intrinsic motions .",
    "the solution of the first equation is the plane wave , whereas the latter equation is similar to the se for a hydrogen atom and can be analytically reduced to the one - dimensional problem . in this case , the exciton binding energy is easily calculated for various semiconductors .",
    "for example , in the case of bulk gaas semiconductor , this energy is @xmath3  mev  @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen model becomes unsuitable for semiconductors with degenerated valence band . in this case , the kohn - luttinger hamiltonian  @xcite , which couples the center - of - mass and intrinsic electron - hole motions , is more appropriate . as a result",
    ", the variables of the exciton se can not be separated and one has to consider the multi - dimensional se  @xcite .",
    "a study of the exciton in a quantum well ( qw ) meets further complications of the problem . even in the simplest case , when only the diagonal part of the kohn - luttinger hamiltonian is included in the problem",
    ", the presence of the qw potential requires one to consider at least the three - dimensional se , which can not be solved analytically .",

    "the qws with finite barriers as well as with infinitely high ones were studied .",
    "the binding energies have been calculated for different qw thicknesses and the breakup of the @xmath4 limit has been obtained for excitons in the qws with finite barriers .",
    "similar results have been obtained in the paper of leavitt and little  @xcite who have applied the method based on the adiabatic approach .",
    "it is worth noting that these authors have also studied the indirect excitons .",

    "@xcite describes a phenomenological model for the binding energy of an exciton in a qw .",
    "the authors compare the results of their model with the energies obtained by the variational approach with the prescribed trial function for the exciton wave function .",
    "the comparison shows a certain advantage in accuracy of the variational approach over the phenomenological model .",
    "the trial wave functions used in the variational calculations of the exciton binding energy can be accurately chosen for two extreme cases .",
    "one of such cases is the wide qw , when the width , @xmath5 , is much larger than the exciton bohr radius , @xmath6 , so that the motion of the exciton as a whole can be separated from the intrinsic motion of the electron and the hole . in this case",
    ", the trial function is a product of the hydrogen - like @xmath1-function and a standing wave describing the quantization of the exciton motion in the wide qw .",
    "another case is the narrow qw , in which the quantum confined energy of the electron and the hole is much larger than their coulomb coupling energy .",
    "then , the separately obtained wave functions of the quantum confined electron and hole states are appropriate approximations  @xcite . the part of wave function taking into account the coulomb interaction",
    "is usually modeled by a simple function with some parameters  @xcite .",
    "so far , the precision of such approximations has not been studied in detail .",

    ", we provide the results of numerical solution of the se for excitons in qws with degenerated valence band",
    ". partial separation ( over two variables ) of the center - of - mass motion and cylindrical symmetry of the problem allowed us to reduce the initial se to the three - dimensional one .",

    "we consider only the diagonal part of the expression  ( [ eq4 ] ) , assuming that the nondiagonal terms contribute little to the energy states  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we do not consider several effects extensively discussed in literature , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "in particular , we ignore the heavy - hole  light - hole coupling . on the one hand , these effects give rise to a relatively small change of the carrier and exciton energies and weak modification of the exciton - light coupling not exceeding experimental errors of the data obtained in our work . on the other hand ,",
    "these simplifications allow us to get a precise numerical solution of the problem and to compare it to that obtained by the standard variational approach .",
