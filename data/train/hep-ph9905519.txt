    "the soft ( nonperturbative ) odderon @xmath3 is introduced in elastic hadron - hadron scattering as the @xmath4 partner of the pomeron @xmath5 @xcite . in perturbation theory",
    "the existence of @xmath4 contributions is clear ( 3-gluon exchange ) .",
    "it is even believed @xcite , that 3-gluon exchange dominates the @xmath6-scattering amplitude @xmath7 for momentum transfers @xmath8 . on the other hand , for @xmath9",
    "it seems that odderon contributions play no role asymptotically or even are absent .",
    "an example is the measurement of @xmath10 at @xmath11 gev @xcite .",
    "together with @xmath6 scattering data at smaller energies one deduces @xmath12 . in other words",
    "the soft odderon couples very weakly to the nucleon .    since soft elastic high energy scattering is totally dominated by the pomeron , it is useful to look at a reaction where pomeron exchange does not contribute . in the following",
    "we discuss some results of @xcite considering exclusive @xmath0 production in high energy @xmath13-scattering .",
    "the @xmath0 is produced ( see fig . [ b1 ] ) by @xmath14-fusion and by @xmath15-fusion , but can not be produced by @xmath16-fusion since the @xmath0 has positive @xmath17-parity .",
    "1.0 cm    ( 15.,4.8 )    ( -0.0,0.2 ) = 4.7 cm    ( 4.5,2.0)@xmath18    in fig .",
    "[ b1 ] x stands for a proton or resonances or a sum over resonances . here",
    "we treat the very small @xmath19 range . in the h1 experiment at hera the kinematical cuts for this so called photoproduction region",
    "are @xmath20 where , in the proton rest frame @xmath21 is the fractional energy loss of the incoming lepton .",
    "this allowes us to use the equivalent photon approximation @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the nucleon mass , @xmath24 is the total photoproduction cross section for the reaction , and @xmath25 is the equivalent photon number .",
    "we look at @xmath26-scattering in the c.m .",
    "system and choose @xmath27 as 3-direction . then the photon and the proton have very large momenta in @xmath28-direction . in the following",
    "we discuss the cases , ( i ) that the proton , which is assumed to be a quark - diquark system with a scalar diquark stays intact or ( ii ) gets diffractively exited into the resonances @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 , described as exited quark - diquark systems .",
    "when considering unpolarised cross sections , summed over both resonances in case ( ii ) , the quark spin degree of freedom becomes irrelevant and the calculation reduces to one where a spinless state stays intact or is exited to a 2p resonance . for ( ii )",
    "the helicity amplitudes are @xcite @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the helicity of the photon ( 2p state ) and @xmath35 is the momentum fraction of the photon , carried by the quark .",
    "the physical picture arising from ( [ psamp ] ) is the following ( fig .",
    "[ gampbild ] ) .",
    "the photon fluctuates into a @xmath36 pair , described by @xmath37 . by soft colour interaction ( odderon exchange ) ,",
    "calculated from the functional integral of two lightlike wegner - wilson loops ( @xmath38 ) the @xmath39 pair turns into a @xmath0 and the proton either stays intact or gets exited ( described by @xmath40 ) .",
    "= 3.2 cm    now , when the proton stays intact there occurs in ( [ psamp ] ) the quark - diquark density ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "but , since this density is symmetric under a parity transformation whereas the odderon coupling changes sign , there is a cancelation when we integrate over all angles . on the other hand",
    "when the proton gets exited to a negative parity state like the resonances @xmath29 and @xmath31 there is no cancellation ( the overlap is odd under parity ) and the odderon couples to the nucleon without any restriction @xcite .",
    "thus in our model the odderon couples only if breakup of the proton occurs .      in fig .",
    "[ msvbild ] we show our result for the differential cross section in @xmath26-scattering , @xmath42 .",
    "1.0 cm    ( 15.,4.8 ) ( 1.0,0.0 )    = 6.5 cm    the slope of @xmath43 at @xmath44 is around @xmath45 .",
    "the integrated cross section is @xcite : @xmath46 as this photoproduction cross section is constant , i.e. independent of @xmath47 , the epa conversion to electroproduction can be achieved by simply multiplying it with a constant @xmath48 corresponding to the @xmath49 integration in ( [ epa ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath50 in the following we consider only @xmath13-scattering .",
    "an experimentally prefered observable is the @xmath51 spectrum , the transverse momentum distribution of the @xmath0 with respect to the beam direction . at hera @xmath51 distributions",
    "can be measured for values of @xmath51 greater than @xmath52(0.1 gev ) .",
    "the photoproduction cuts of ( [ cuts ] ) restrict the transverse momentum of the incident photon to be smaller than @xmath52(0.1 gev ) , so in our case there is practically no distinction between the beam axis and the photon axis .",
    "the @xmath51 spectrum is displayed in fig .",
    "[ k_tmsv ]    1.0 cm    ( 15.,4.4 ) ( 0.5,-0.2 )    = 6.5 cm",
    "in this section we consider ps production mediated by photon rather than odderon exchange ( fig .",
    "[ b1 ] ) . again the proton , now hit by the photon , is allowed to go into some hadron final state x. the process has been calculated in @xcite for x being a proton . in @xcite",
    "we have calculated the cross section , when x is a hadron final state in the invariant mass ( @xmath53 ) range @xmath54 gev . in fig .",
    "[ k_tmsv ] we show the distribution of the pion s @xmath51 summed over the elastic and all inelastic channels for the electromagnetic exchange .",
    "as we can see there the photon exchange is larger than the odderon exchange only for very small @xmath51 . for @xmath55",
    "gev the odderon exchange dominates by orders of magnitude .",
    "the integrated cross section is @xcite : @xmath56 which has to be compared with the odderon cross section ( [ oddcross ] ) .",
    "in addition we have estimated in @xcite contributions from reggeon ( @xmath57 ) exchange and from a possible background process , namely an additional final state photon emitted from the @xmath0 vertex ( fig .",
    "[ b1 ] ) , where we have used realistc cuts .",
    "both contributions are of the same order of magnitude as the photon exchange contribution .",
    "the conclusion is : with the large odderon cross section as given in our model the process should be observable at hera .",
    "this would establish the soft odderon as an exchange - object in high energy scattering on an equal footing with the soft pomeron ."
