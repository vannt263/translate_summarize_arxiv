    "the interaction between quantum degenerate atomic gases and optical fields is a cornerstone of modern atomic physics and quantum optics . in early experiments on bose - einstein condensation ,",
    "light fields were applied primarily for the capture and precooling of atoms , preceding the last stage of evaporative cooling in a magnetic trap .",
    "they were also used to obtain dramatic images of the condensates ( bec ) , and to launch solitons @xcite and vortices @xcite in condensates .",
    "this was soon followed by applications such as the trapping of condensates in optical dipole traps , and the demonstrations of matter - wave superradiance @xcite and of coherent matter - wave amplification @xcite .",
    "more recently , optical dipole traps have been employed for the all - optical realization of bec and of quantum - degenerate fermi gases @xcite .",
    "optical lattices , formed by counterpropagating laser beams in one , two and three dimensions , were originally used in polarization gradient cooling and sub - recoil cooling experiments at the single - atom level .",
    "they rapidly found further applications in the manipulation of becs , first in the demonstration of a ",
    "mode - locked \" atom laser and the observation of josephson tunneling between lattice wells @xcite , and subsequently in the transport and acceleration of condensates @xcite .",
    "more recently , they have lead to the demonstration of the superfluid - mott insulator transition @xcite , and of the collapse and revival of the condensate wave function @xcite . in the near future",
    ", they may also prove useful in the realization of bright atomic solitons relying on negative effective atomic masses in periodic potentials @xcite .",
    "in contrast to magnetic traps , which only capture atoms in weak - field seeking states , optical traps function for all hyperfine sublevels of the alkali electronic ground states . this presents considerable advantages , in particular in the study of spinor condensates such as sodium and rubidium .",
    "the first study of the magnetic properties of spinor condensates were carried out by ketterle and coworkers , who investigated the existence of coexisting spin domains in @xmath0na , an `` anti - ferromagnetic '' , or `` polar '' condensate @xcite .",
    "recent experimental and theoretical studies have established that in contrast to @xmath0na , @xmath1rb is expected to be ferromagnetic at zero temperature .",
    "that is , the expectation value of its total spin @xmath2 is finite , @xmath3 @xcite . as a result , an ensemble of condensates placed at the potential minima of an optical lattice would act as mesoscopic magnets , much like large spins on a crystalline lattice . in the absence of external fields and long range site - to - site interactions , these magnets would have random orientations .",
    "the situation is changed in the presence of interactions between neighboring lattice sites .",
    "it is known that in the case of spins on a crystal lattice , the dominant source of coupling is the quantum - mechanical exchange interaction .",
    "we recall that 19th century physics failed in its attempts to explain ferromagnetism in terms of the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction , and it is heisenberg who first introduced the exchange force to explain this effect @xcite . in the present case , though , the overlap between neighboring condensate wave functions is negligible for deep enough lattice wells  the mott insulator state  and so is the exchange interaction . instead ,",
    "the individual mesoscopic magnets are coupled by the magnetic ( and possibly also the optical ) dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "because of the large number @xmath4 of atoms at each lattice site , this interaction is no longer negligible , despite the large distance , of the order of half an optical wavelength , between sites . as such , the present situation is in some sense a return to 19th century physics .",
    "the goal of this paper is to discuss several aspects of the spin and magnetic properties of such lattice systems in one- and two - dimensions .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii briefly reviews the theory of spinor condensates in general , with special emphasis on the ferromagnetic and polar ground states resulting from local spin - changing collisions .",
    "we then introduce the nonlocal long - range magnetic dipole - dipole interaction between condensates at different sites in the optical lattice . section iii briefly reviews previously published results on one - dimensional lattices , and discusses the ferromagnetic ground state of the full lattice . on this basis ,",
    "an extension of the one - dimensional case to two - dimensional lattices are analyzed in section iv .",
    "the ground state of the system is determined numerically using a genetic algorithm that is discussed in some detail .",
    "we show that in that case , the ground state is normally anti - ferromagnetic .",
    "edge effects are also briefly addressed .",
    "finally , section v is a conclusion and outlook .",
    "the dynamics of spinor condensates trapped in optical lattices is primarily governed by three types of two - body interactions : spin - changing collisions , magnetic dipole - dipole interactions , and light - induced dipole - dipole interactions . for an optical lattice created by blue - detuned laser beams ,",
    "the atoms are trapped in the dark - field nodes of the lattice and the light - induced dipole - dipole interaction can be neglected @xcite . in this paper , we focus on this case . as a preparation for sections iii ,",
    "iv and v , we first discuss the interatomic interactions in some detail .",
    "in second - quantized form , the hamiltonian describing a system of spin @xmath5 bosons subject to local spin - changing collisions is @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the field annihilation operator for an atom in the hyperfine state @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is a potential produced by an optical dipole trap and assumed to be the same for all hyperfine states , and @xmath11 is the mass of the atoms .",

    "this is the case for @xmath0na condensates , in which case @xmath31 a.u .",
    "ketterle and coworkers have studied this situation in great detail @xcite . in particular",
    "they have obtained spin - domain diagrams and studied experimentally the miscibility of these domains in the presence of external fields .    for @xmath32 , in contrast ,",
    "the energy @xmath29 is minimized by making @xmath33 . as discussed in ref .",

    "all possible orientations @xmath37 are possible and lead to the same ground - state energy @xmath29 .",
    "recent theoretical calculations by klausen _",
    "predict that for spin-1 @xmath1rb , the scattering lengths @xmath17 and @xmath18 are almost equal , but with @xmath38 , with a difference of the order of 0.3 to 2.7 a.u .",
    "@xcite .",
    "consider , then , an @xmath1rb condensate trapped on an optical lattice with wells deep enough that its ground state is the mott - insulator state , i.e. , there is no global phase of the condensate over many lattice sites @xcite .",
    "each lattice site is therefore the location of a `` mini - condensate , '' which can contain as many as several thousands atoms in one - dimensional lattices , and several hundreds in 2-d lattices . in the absence of external fields and long - range site - to - site interactions ,",
    "these condensates can be thought of as independent magnets , whose spin vectors point in random directions , with no spin correlations between sites .",
    "this situation is similar to the spin lattices familiar from the study of magnetism , with two differences .",
    "first , the quantum mechanical exchange interaction , which is at the core of magnetism , is completely negligible in the present situation .",
    "this is because neighboring sites on an optical lattice are at least one half optical wavelength apart . for deep lattice wells , the center - of - mass wave functions for the individual mini - condensate",
    " essentially the ground state wannier wave functions at the individual sites  do not have any significant overlap .",
    "second , the magnetic dipolar coupling , which is normally negligible and leads to the prediction of curie temperatures several orders of magnitude lower than actually observed in solid state magnetic materials , is now the dominant interaction , due to the large number @xmath4 of atoms at each lattice site .",
    "this leads to an @xmath39 enhancement factor , as we now show .      in order to describe the magnetic dipolar interaction between mini - condensates at lattice sites @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we assume that the condensates at each site can be treated independently , and have the same spatial form , which is also independent of the spin state of the atoms . specifically , we decompose the schrdinger field operator as @xmath42 with @xmath43 in this expansion , which goes beyond the mean - field approximation of eq .",

    "in this section , we study the magnetic properties and spin dynamics of spinor condensates in a 1d optical lattice . more specifically",

    "the hamiltonian describing the spin @xmath79 of a generic site @xmath80 reads then @xmath81 .",
    "\\label{hi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now proceed to determine the ground state of the single - site hamiltonian ( [ hi ] ) in the mean - field  or weiss molecular field  approximation @xcite .",
    "it consists in replacing the operators @xmath82 , @xmath83 , by their ground - state expectation value @xmath84 which is assumed to be the same for all sites .",
    "we remark that @xmath85 is nothing but the difference in population of the zeeman sublevels of magnetic quantum numbers @xmath86 .",
    "replacing @xmath82 by @xmath87 allows us to approximate the hamiltonian ( [ hi ] ) by @xmath88 where we have introduced the effective magnetic field @xmath89 and @xmath90    in the case of @xmath1rb , the individual spinor condensates at the lattice sites are ferromagnetic , @xmath91 . in that case , the ground state of the mean - field hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) must correspond to a situation where the condensate at the site @xmath80 under consideration must be aligned along @xmath92 and takes its maximum possible value @xmath4 .",
    "that is , the ground state of the mean - field hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) is simply @xmath93 where the first number denotes the total angular momentum and the second its component along the direction of @xmath92 .",
    "note that @xmath94 represents a spin coherent state in the basis of @xmath95 .",
    "the fact that the ground state magnetic dipole moment of each lattice site is @xmath4 times that of an individual atom results in a significant magnetic dipole - dipole interaction even for lattice points separated by hundreds of nanometers .",
    "this feature , which can be interpreted as a signature of bose enhancement , is in stark contrast with usual ferromagnetism , where the magnetic interaction is negligible compared to exchange and where the use of fermions is essential .    the mean - field ground state of eq .",
    "( [ gs ] ) allows us to calculate the magnetization @xmath96 .",
    "one finds readily @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the angle between @xmath92 and the @xmath47-axis . in the absence of externally applied field , @xmath99 , this gives    [ mxz ] @xmath100    where @xmath101 normalizes the magnetization vector to unity .    since @xmath102 , the third of these equations implies that @xmath103 . with @xmath104 and the condition @xmath105 , which follows directly from the equation for @xmath85 , we find further that for @xmath106 , the unique solution is @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "that is , the lattice of condensates is magnetically polarized along the environmental magnetic field @xmath109 . for @xmath110 , in contrast , there are two coexisting sets of solutions : i ) @xmath107 and @xmath111 ; and ii ) @xmath112 , @xmath103 and @xmath113 .",
    "it is easily seen that the state associated with the latter solutions has the lower energy .",
    "hence it corresponds to the true ground state , while solution 1 represents an unstable equilibrium .",
    "we have , then , the following situation : as the effective magnetic field strength @xmath109 is reduced below the critical value @xmath114 , the lattice ceases to be polarized along the direction of that field .",
    "a phase transition occurs , and a _ spontaneous magnetization _ along the @xmath115-direction appears , characterized by a finite @xmath85 .",
    "this phenomenon is reminiscent of conventional ferromagnetism .",
    "indeed , our model is analogous to the ising model@xcite , with the environmental transverse magnetic field @xmath116 playing the role of temperature . for @xmath117  corresponding to zero temperature in ising model  the spins at each lattice site @xmath118 align themselves along the lattice direction , even in the absence of longitudinal field .",
    "this spontaneous spin magnetization diminishes as @xmath116 increases , and completely vanishes if @xmath116 exceeds the critical value @xmath119  the analog of the curie temperature in the ising model .",
    "we note however that the situation at hand exhibits important qualitative differences with the ising model .",
    "for example , no spontaneous magnetization occurs in 1d ising model , for any finite temperature .",
    "we note however that the appearance of a spontaneous magnetization does not rely on this condition being fulfilled .",
    "this point was discussed in ref.@xcite , which numerically solved the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) without invoking the mean - field approximation for a two - well system and showed how the situation rapidly approaches the mean - field results as @xmath4 increases .",
    "now we turn our attention to 2d lattices , formed as before by blue - detuned lasers .",
    "we show that depending on the relative magnitude of the lattice constants along its two axes , this system exhibits a variety of possible ground states , including an anti - ferromagnetic configuration .",
    "we consider a rectangular lattice in the @xmath120-plane , with primitive lattice vectors @xmath121 and @xmath122 , of lengths @xmath123 and @xmath124 , in these two directions .",
    "we assume as before that the number of atoms at each lattice site is the same and that the atoms are tightly confined so that we can approximate their probability density by a delta function at each lattice site , @xmath125 here , @xmath126 is the position of the center of the @xmath127 lattice site . under these conditions ,",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ h ] ) with @xmath128 becomes @xmath129 \\label{h11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 and @xmath131 , with @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "as in the preceding section , we determine the ground state of the lattice in the semiclassical limit , ignoring spin - spin correlations and replacing the operators @xmath134 with their expectation value with respect to a spin coherent state , @xmath135 the semiclassical ground state corresponds to the orientation of the spin vectors that minimizes the semiclassical energy corresponding to the hamiltonian ( [ h11 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the one - dimensional case , it is not obvious from inspection of eq .",
    "( [ h11 ] ) that all expectation values @xmath136 should be equal .",
    "hence , the determination of the ground state for an @xmath137 lattice requires the minimalization of the energy with respect to @xmath138 variables . however , in the limit of an infinite lattice the ground state should be translationally invariant with respect to displacements of the spins by a finite number of lattice constants along either axis .",
    "we can therefore generalize the mean - field ansatz used in the one - dimensional case by assuming that the 2d lattice can be decomposed into a finite set @xmath139 of interpenetrating periodic sublattices for which all spin vectors have the same orientation .",
    "the positions of the sites of the sublattice @xmath140 of primitive lattice vectors @xmath141 and @xmath142 are @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 denote the origin of that lattice .",
    "since the interaction between dipole moments that are perpendicular to the plane of the lattice is repulsive while the interaction between dipole moments in the plane of the lattice is predominantly attractive , the ground state must correspond to spin vectors in the plane @xmath120 of the lattice .",
    "hence the spin vector associated with the sublattice @xmath140 can be written as @xmath146    one can gain an intuitive feel for the ground state of the system by considering what happens when one lets a 1d lattice approach an already existing one from infinity .",
    "for concreteness , we take the axes of both lattices to be along @xmath147 . we know from the previous section that for large lattice separations , the spins in each lattice will be oriented in either the @xmath148 or @xmath149 direction with equal probability . in effect , each lattice acts like a long bar magnet . as the lattices approach each other , though , they start to interact via their magnetic dipole moments .",
    "the minimization of energy then proceeds in a familiar way : just as two bar magnets placed side by side orient themselves so that opposite poles are next to each other , the spins of the two 1d lattices will arrange their orientation so that the spins in one lattice point along @xmath148 while in the other lattice the spins point along @xmath149 .",
    "this will remain true as long as the lattice separation is much larger than the primitive lattice vector @xmath150 of the 1d lattices , due to the @xmath151 dependence of the magnetic dipole interaction .",
    "indeed , in this case the easy axis is the @xmath152-axis .",
    "this argument can easily be generalized to many rows .",
    "it follows that for @xmath153 , rows of spins parallel to the @xmath115-axis will alternatively align themselves along the @xmath148 and @xmath149 direction .",
    "similarly , for @xmath154 , the @xmath115-axis becomes the easy axis and rows of spins parallel to @xmath152 align themselves alternatively along the @xmath155 or @xmath156 direction . in both cases ,",
    "though , the ground state is expected to be anti - ferromagnetic .",
    "even though the magnetic dipole interaction is long ranged , it is easy to see that neighboring spins within each row interact more strongly than do neighboring spins in adjacent rows provided that @xmath157 with @xmath158 positive .",
    "one therefore expects that the ground state will remain anti - ferromagnetic unless @xmath159 . in this limit",
    ", there are clearly two degenerate anti - ferromagnetic ground states that are topologically distinct , i.e. that can not be related by a simple rotation",
    ". any weighted combination of these two configurations has the same energy and is therefore a new degenerate ground state . assigning the weight @xmath160 to the ground state with all spins pointing in the @xmath161 direction and @xmath162 to the ground state with all spins in the @xmath163",
    ", then we find that this situation is equivalent to a ground state consisting of four interpenetrating sublattices ( @xmath164 ) , with spin orientations ,    [ m1 ] @xmath165    and sublattice sites located at    [ r4 ] @xmath166    where @xmath167 .",
    "the corresponding lattice structure is illustrated in fig .",

    "the lengths are in units of @xmath174 . ]",
    "the next section discusses the use of a genetic algorithm to numerically determine of the lattice ground state for a finite lattice size .",
    "genetic algorithms have become a widely used tool for solving optimization problems that depend on a large number of variables @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind genetic algorithms is darwinian natural selection .",
    "these algorithms proceed from an initial set of trial solutions to the optimization problem , which can be thought of as individuals in a population .",
    "the individuals breed , following some prescribed mating rules , to produce offspring , which constitute the next generation of individuals .",
    "in addition , random mutations are also introduced .",
    "the offspring that produce better solutions to the problem survive and are allowed to further breed , while those that produce poor solutions are eliminated .",
    "ideally , after many generations the algorithm converges to the optimal solution(s ) to the problem at hand .    in the specific system at hand ,",
    "the algorithm starts from a large population @xmath175 of initial lattices , typically @xmath176 .",
    "most of them have completely random spin orientations , but some may have ordered configurations based on the ground state of the infinite lattice . at each generation , the genetic algorithm performs a combination of mutations and breeding steps on the members of the population , which we refer to as mutating and mating .",
    "the mutations modify each member of the population to form a second population of @xmath175 lattices .",
    "they can be either global and local .",
    "local mutations involve giving random rotations to a random percentage of the spins in the individual lattices .",
    "these rotations are by angles @xmath177 and @xmath169 about the @xmath152 and @xmath178 axes , respectively , where @xmath177 and @xmath169 are normally distributed random numbers with standard deviations typically chosen to be @xmath179 . in contrast , the global mutations rotate _ all _ spin in the lattice by related amounts : they either apply the same random rotation to all lattice sites , or rotate the spin at each lattice site by a slightly different amount determined by its value ( this is used when investigating the case of equal lattice constants , @xmath180 , discussed below ) .",
    "in general , a given individual is subjected to both local and global mutations .",
    "after the mutations are performed , the @xmath181 individuals are allowed to mate .",
    "the mating process randomly picks two individuals using a normally distributed probability distribution centered around individuals with the lowest energy .",
    "this insures that , on average , only those individuals with the lowest energies produce offspring .",
    "each pair of parents produces two offsprings using one of four randomly selected mating techniques : site swapping , sub - lattice swapping , row and column swapping , and row and column rearranging .",
    "site swapping consists of swapping a random number of randomly chosen sites from the parents .",
    "similarly , sub - lattice swapping consists of swapping a randomly sized and positioned sub - lattice between the parents .",
    "row and column swapping works by randomly picking rows from both parents and forming one child , and doing the same with columns to form a second child . row and column rearranging uses only a single parent to produce a child by randomly rearranging its rows or columns .",
    "the mating process is repeated @xmath175 times at each generation to produce a total population of @xmath182 lattices . of those ,",
    "only the @xmath175 individuals with the lowest energy are selected as parents for the next generation .",
    "the genetic algorithm is run until the relative energies of the individuals in generation @xmath183 and @xmath184 differ by less than @xmath185 .",
    "the ground state of the system determined by the genetic algorithm is characterized by all spins lying in the plane of the lattice , in agreement with the discussion of section iv .",
    "if the lengths of the primitive lattice vectors @xmath123 and @xmath124 differ significantly , say , by 10 percent or more , the ground state is anti - ferromagnetic . with the exception of sites near the lattice boundary , the anti - ferromagnetic structure is identical to that predicted based on an infinite lattice .",
    "as is to be expected , boundary effects become more important , the smaller the lattice . in that case , the ground state is characterized by spins orientations near the boundaries that deviate from the @xmath186 or @xmath187 directions .",
    "when @xmath123 and @xmath124 are significantly different , these boundary effects are manifest only near the corners of the lattice , and they lower the ground state energy by a very small amount .",
    "for example , for @xmath188 and @xmath189 , where @xmath174 is the wavelength of the laser forming the lattice in the @xmath115-direction , the boundary effects reduce the ground - state energy of an @xmath190 lattice by only @xmath191 percent compared to its infinite lattice value . for larger lattices ,",
    "the boundary effects become even smaller .    when @xmath192 , finite size effects are more important in determining the spin structure of the ground state .",
    "we recall that in that case , an infinite lattice possesses an infinite number of degenerate ground states characterized by the angle @xmath169 .",
    "boundary effects break this degeneracy and lead to the appearance of a preferred pattern .",
    "[ fig2 ] illustrates the transition from the boundary dominated pattern of the @xmath192 situation to the anti - ferromagnetic configuration of @xmath193 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , for the case of @xmath192 , near boundaries the spins are aligned parallel to them . that this should be the case is plausible since when going from a situation where @xmath194 to @xmath195 , the spin orientation must go from being parallel to the @xmath152-axis to being parallel to the @xmath115-axis . to accommodate the orthogonal directions along two adjacent boundaries , the angle @xmath169 near the corners changes in such a way that the spins at the corner sites make an angle of @xmath196 relative to the @xmath152- and @xmath115-axis .",

    "we have shown here that the array of spin magnets can undergo a ferromagnetic ( in the 1d case ) or anti - ferromagnetic ( in the 2d case ) phase transition under the dipolar interaction when external magnetic fields are sufficiently weak . using the same mechanism",
    ", it will also be possible to create ferrimagnetic lattice systems if one can interleave two sets of optical dipole potentials , each trapping one species of atoms ( or one hyperfine state of the same atom ) different from the other .",
    "in the case of a far red - detuned lattice such that the spacing between adjacent lattice site exceeds the atomic resonant wavelength , the detection of the ground state spin structure amounts to detecting populations in the individual zeeman sublevels at each site .",
    "this can be achieved using a raman scattering scheme .",
    "for example , one can shine two light beams , one @xmath200-polarized and the other circularly polarized , onto the system .",
    "the absorption or gain of the probing light after passing the sample is then a measure of the relative population of the hyperfine levels , since it depends upon which of them are initially populated .",
    "this scheme would nt work for a blue detuned lattice , though , since in that case the spacing between neighboring sites is sub - wavelength .",
    "however , the long range periodic spin structure , in particular the ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic ordering , can still be detected by bragg scattering @xcite .",
    "let us take @xmath1rb as an example .",
    "its ground state is the 5s@xmath201 state with @xmath202 . for @xmath203-polarized bragg probe light",
    "( we choose the quantization axis to be parallel or antiparallel to atomic spins ) with a frequency close to the @xmath204 d2 resonance line , then the ratio of the transition strength ( or scattering cross section ) for atoms in @xmath205 and @xmath206 zeeman sublevel is @xmath207 . as a result ,",
    "the bragg signal depends on whether one has a ferromagnetic lattice ( where all the atoms are in either @xmath205 or @xmath206 zeeman sublevel ) or anti - ferromagnetic lattice ( where half the atoms are in @xmath205 and the other half are in @xmath206 sublevel ) .",
    "in addition to their ground state structure , spinor condensates in an optical lattices also possesses considerable potential for studying other phenomena such as spin waves @xcite , macroscopic magnetization tunneling @xcite , domain wall formation , etc .",
    "future studies will also include the dynamical properties of the system",
    ". due to the long - range as well as the nonlinear nature of the dipolar interaction , the dynamics of the system should be very rich .",
    "for instance , given a ground state 2d lattice with primitive lattice constants @xmath194 where all the spins are aligned along the @xmath208 direction , one can suddenly modify the lattice light so that @xmath195 .",
    "whether and how the spins adjust themselves to the new ground state will be an interesting problem , closely related to the phenomenon of spin tunneling @xcite .",
    "in addition , these systems may also find applications in the field of quantum information and computation .",
    "we conclude by noting that in addition to the mott insulator limit studied in this paper , the genetic algorithm that we have developed here might be modified to investigate the other limit where tunneling between lattice sites becomes significant and the system becomes a superfluid @xcite .",
