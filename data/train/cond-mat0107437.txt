    "for a statistical description of a matrix ensemble , one has to define a measure of the space of the matrices having the required symmetries .",
    "if one is interested by the distribution of a restricted set of parameters suitable for describing the matrices ( e. g. the eigenvalues of an hermitian matrix ) , one has to use the system of coordinates using those parameters .",
    "the j acobian of the transformation ( e. g. from matrix elements coordinates towards eigenvalue - eigenvector coordinates ) yields correlations between those parameters .",
    "those correlations ( level repulsions ) are at the origin of universal behaviors first observed in complex nuclei , then in small metallic particles , quantum billiards , hydrogen atom in a magnetic field , mesoscopic quantum systems , electro - magnetic cavities ... the simplest illustration is given by the gaussian ensembles of hermitian matrices introduced in this section .",
    "another illustration is given in the following section : the distribution of the radial parameters characterizing a scattering matrix @xmath0 or a transfer matrix @xmath1 .",
    "for doing statistics with real numbers , one defines the probability @xmath2 to have a real number @xmath3 inside an infinitesimal interval of length @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a density and @xmath7 the measure of an infinitesimal interval of the real axis .",
    "similarly , for doing statistics with matrices @xmath8 , one defines the measure @xmath9 of an infinitesimal volume element @xmath10 of the matrix space in which @xmath8 is defined and one gives a density probability @xmath11 .",
    "the measure @xmath9 is given by the symmetries of @xmath8 , while the density @xmath11 may contain physical assumptions ( e.g. minimum information density given a few physical constraints ) .",
    "for instance , let us introduce the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of real symmetric matrices @xmath12 and the probability distribution of their eigenvalues @xmath13 .",
    "a real symmetric matrix @xmath14 of size",
    "@xmath15 has @xmath16 independent entries .",
    "the infinitesimal volume element @xmath17 has a measure @xmath18 given by the product of the infinitesimal variations @xmath19 of the @xmath20 independent entries : @xmath21 a possible definition of the goe density probability @xmath22 is given by a maximum entropy criterion .",
    "minimizing @xcite the information entropy @xmath23 with an imposed expectation value for the trace of @xmath24 gives @xmath25 since @xmath26 the @xmath20 independent matrix elements @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) are uncorrelated variables with gaussian distributions of variance @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the diagonal and the off - diagonal entries respectively .",
    "this ratio between the variances is important since it makes the goe ensemble invariant under change of basis : @xmath22 is only function of the @xmath15 eigenvalues @xmath13 of @xmath12 through @xmath31 and does not depend on the eigenvectors of @xmath12 . to calculate @xmath32 ,",
    "one has to go from the parameterization of @xmath12 in terms of its matrix elements @xmath27 to the parameterization of @xmath12 in terms of its eigenvalue - eigenvector coordinates .",
    "the jacobian of this change of coordinates is at the basis of the level repulsion and of the spectral rigidity characteristic of usual random matrix theories .",
    "a real symmetric matrix is diagonalizable by an orthogonal transformation .",
    "let us define the measure of an orthogonal transformation @xmath33 .",
    "we first consider a @xmath34 rotation @xmath35 of angle @xmath36 .",
    "one has @xmath37 and by differentiation @xmath38    clearly , @xmath39 is the appropriate measure for the transformation @xmath35 .",
    "the generalization to an arbitrary @xmath40 orthogonal transformation @xmath33 is straightforward : @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the unit @xmath40 matrix .",

    "@xmath12 is diagonalizable by an orthogonal transformation @xmath45 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a real diagonal matrix of entries @xmath13 and of measure @xmath48 . by differentiation",
    ", one gets @xmath49 where we have used @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the real symmetric matrix @xmath17 is related to @xmath52 by an orthogonal transformation .",
    "the jacobian is equal to one and @xmath53 .",
    "the product of the infinitesimal diagonal elements of @xmath52 gives @xmath54 , the off - diagonal contribution gives @xmath55 , and one eventually obtains the measure @xmath18 in terms of the measures @xmath56 and @xmath54 @xmath57 in terms of the eigenvalue - eigenvector coordinates of @xmath12 , the goe distribution becomes : @xmath58 where the joint probability distribution of the eigenvalues is identical to the gibbs factor of a set of @xmath15 point charges free to move on the real axis of the complex plane with a pairwise logarithmic repulsion and a quadratic confining potential at an inverse temperature @xmath59 : latexmath:[\\[p(e_1 , \\ldots , e_n ) \\propto \\exp \\left[-\\beta \\sum_{i < j}^n \\ln    pairwise repulsion coming from the jacobian makes unlikely level degeneracies and explains why dramatically non - random an energy - level series really is .",
    "this is the coulomb gas analogy usual in random matrix theory . to appreciate how this random matrix approach is adapted to include symmetry breaking effects ,",
    "let us assume that the matrix @xmath12 is the hamiltonian of an electron moving in a chaotic cavity .",
    "applying a magnetic field removes time reversal symmetry , @xmath12 becomes hermitian ( @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 , taking into account the infinitesimal variations of the real and imaginary parts of its matrix elements ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "@xmath12 is now diagonalizable by a unitary transformation @xmath64 and @xmath65 where @xmath66 is an infinitesimal anti - hermitian matrix ( @xmath67 ) , and @xmath68 .",
    "one obtains for hermitian matrices",
    "@xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "the jacobian of a unitary transformation being equal to one , one eventually finds latexmath:[$\\mu(dh ) = \\prod_{i < j }    from the fact that the non diagonal contribution of @xmath52 is now complex . breaking time reversal symmetry ,",
    "one keeps the coulomb gas analogy , with a temperature divided by a factor two ( @xmath72 ) . for electrons of spin @xmath73",
    ", one can also break spin rotation symmetry ( srs ) by spin orbit scattering , an effect which preserves time reversal symmetry ( trs ) .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath12 are no longer real ( @xmath59 ) or complex ( @xmath74 ) , but quaternion real @xmath75 and the level distribution is still given by the coulomb gas analogy with a temperature divided by a factor 4 : @xmath76 .",
    "the main feature of those three gaussian ensembles of random matrices is that @xmath22 does not couple eigenvalue and eigenvector variables .",
    "these ensembles are invariant under canonical transformations : orthogonal transformations ( @xmath77 when the system invariant under trs and srs symmetries , unitary transformations @xmath78 ) in the absence of trs and symplectic transformations ( @xmath79 ) with trs and without srs .",
    "the eigenvectors are totally random , the measure of the matrices @xmath45 or @xmath64 are given by the haar measures over the orthogonal or unitary groups respectively , and the integration over the eigenvectors is trivial .",
    "this is the totally random character of the eigenvectors which makes the energy levels correlated ( pairwise logarithmic repulsion ) and subject to universal symmetry breaking effects ( e.g. @xmath80 when trs is broken ) .",
    "similar random matrix theories can be adapted to matrices having different symmetries and can give the joint probability distribution of a subset of variables which can be used for their parameterization .",
    "another example is provided by the unitary matrices describing complex elastic scatterers .",
    "let us consider a perfect waveguide characterized by @xmath15 quantized modes propagating to the right and @xmath15 time reversed modes propagating to the left .",
    "let us introduce in the middle of this wave guide a complex elastic scatterer described by its @xmath81 scattering matrix @xmath0 .",
    "this matrix describes the various transmission and reflection amplitudes to the right or to the left , has to be unitary for conserving the flux amplitudes ( @xmath82 ) , and must be symmetric ( @xmath83 ) if one has time reversal invariant scattering : @xmath84 the @xmath40 matrices @xmath85 and @xmath86 describe transmission amplitudes of the incoming fluxes to the right and left directions respectively , while @xmath87 and @xmath88 describe reflections . let us consider time reversal invariant scattering where @xmath0 is symmetric and can be decomposed as @xmath89 where @xmath64 and @xmath90 are respectively a unitary and an infinitesimal real symmetric matrices .",
    "this decomposition is not unique , one can multiply @xmath64 by an arbitrary orthogonal transformation @xmath45 ( @xmath91 ) but the measure @xmath92 is uniquely defined since the jacobian of the transformation @xmath93 is equal to one .",
    "@xmath94 was expressed by dyson @xcite in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath0 and their associated measures .",
    "the original motivation in dyson s work was not at all to study a scattering problem , but to use the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath0 for describing energy - level statistics ( the eigenvalues of @xmath0 being confined on the unit circle of the complex plane , one does not need the somewhat artificial goe quadratic confining potential ) . for a scattering problem ,",
    "the eigenvalue - eigenvector parameterization of @xmath0 is not adapted and we introduce a more convenient one using @xmath95 unitary @xmath40 matrices @xmath96 and @xmath97 and a diagonal @xmath98 matrix @xmath99 with @xmath15 real positive diagonal entries @xmath100 . denoting @xmath101 and @xmath102 , @xmath0 can be written as : @xmath103 in this parameterization , the transmission and reflection matrices become @xmath104 and @xmath105 and @xmath106 contain the eigenvalues of @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( transmission and reflection eigenvalues ) .",
    "one can note that the transfer matrix @xmath1 which gives the flux amplitudes of the right side of the scatterer in terms of the flux amplitudes of its left side can be written using the same parameterization as @xmath109 @xmath1 is pseudo unitary ( flux conservation ) @xmath110 and when one has trs ( @xmath59 ) , @xmath1 must also satisfy the requirement : @xmath111 @xmath1 has the advantage to be multiplicative when one puts the scatterers in series .",
    "for the derivation of this parameterization of @xmath0 , see ref.@xcite , and use the relation between the matrices @xmath1 and @xmath0 . to understand the interest of this parameterization",
    ", we introduce the variables @xmath112 from @xmath113 .",
    "one can see than @xmath1 is decomposed in the product of a unitary transformation , followed by @xmath15 hyperbolic rotations of angle @xmath112 : @xmath114 before a second unitary transformation .",
    "the @xmath15 parameters @xmath115 are called the radial parameters of @xmath1 ( or @xmath0 ) .    diagonalizing the matrix containing those parameters in the new parameterization of @xmath0 by the orthogonal matrix @xmath45 @xmath116 and denoting @xmath117 and @xmath118 one can write @xmath119 where the unitary matrix @xmath120 . defining the infinitesimal anti - hermitian and real antisymmetric matrices @xmath121 and @xmath122 from @xmath123 and @xmath124 , using @xmath125 , one obtains : @xmath126 which allows us to write the jacobian matrix of the change of coordinates @xmath127 .",
    "this matrix has a simple block diagonal form and its determinant gives the measure @xmath94 in terms of the measures @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "we have sketched the derivation when @xmath0 is unitary symmetric ( @xmath77 , but the extension to the three possible symmetry classes is straightforward and gives for @xmath130 the general form @xcite @xmath131 if the scattering is not time reversal symmetric ( @xmath74 ) , @xmath0 is no longer symmetric and one needs two additional unitary matrices @xmath132 and @xmath133 for parameterizing @xmath0 and @xmath134 . if one considers scattering of spin @xmath73 particles by a trs scatterer which removes srs ( spin - orbit scattering ) , @xmath79 .",
    "one can similarly show that the measure for the transfer matrices @xcite is given in terms of the radial parameters @xmath115 by : @xmath135",
    "let us assume that the scatterer represented by the matrix @xmath0 is a ballistic cavity of irregular shape having chaotic classical dynamics , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "we have in mind long scattering trajectories corresponding to particles reflected many times inside the cavity before being transmitted or reflected .",
    "let us assume that the shape of the cavity is slightly modified , or that the wave length of the incoming fluxes varies .",
    "the scattering will be deeply re - organized and a statistical description of the fluctuations of the scattering amplitudes becomes necessary . to this end , we need to define a statistical ensemble of scattering matrices @xmath0 and we will assume that the scatterer will visit this ensemble when one varies a tunable parameter ( shape of the cavity , wave - length , applied magnetic field reorganizing the quantum interferences if we consider electron elastic scattering ) .",
    "the simplest ensemble is the one where all the scattering processes are equiprobable , which does not contain any information about the system excepted its basic symmetries .",
    "those ensembles of minimum information entropy for @xmath0 are the circular ensembles @xcite introduced by dyson in 1962 , for which the probability to find @xmath0 inside a volume element @xmath136 is @xmath137 where @xmath138 is a normalization constant .",
    "one obtains for the radial parameters @xmath139 a coulomb gas analogy very similar to the goe - gue - gse coulomb gas analogies for the energy level of a random hamiltonian , excepted two noticeable differences : ( i ) the @xmath115 are real positive in contrast to the @xmath13 which are only real , the coulomb gas is free to move only on the positive part of the real axis in the complex plane ( ii ) the confining potential @xmath140 is implied by the symmetries of @xmath0 ( in contrast to the quadratic potential given by a certain choice of @xmath22 ) and depends on the symmetry parameter @xmath141 .",
    "let us see the implication for the total transmission probability @xmath142 .",
    "when @xmath0 gives fermi wave scattering by a mesoscopic scatterer coupling to electron reservoirs , @xmath143 gives its electrical conductance in units of @xmath144 ( landauer formula ) .",
    "if @xmath145 ( single mode wave guide ) , the probability distribution of @xmath143 exhibits strong symmetry breaking effects ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) : @xmath146     for a chaotic cavity coupled to leads via single mode contacts ( @xmath145).,height=226 ]    if one measures the electrical conductance of a chaotic cavity ( quantum billiard ) coupled to two electron reservoirs by single mode leads , the conductance is likely to be close to @xmath147 if one has trs and srs , to have a value uniformly distributed between @xmath147 and @xmath144 if one applies a small magnetic field ( no trs ) , and a value close to @xmath144 if the electron reflection on the walls of the cavity is accompanied by spin - orbit scattering ( no srs ) . the distribution @xmath148 can be explored by changing the fermi energy with a metallic gate , by small deformations of the cavity or by applying a magnetic field .    if @xmath149 the symmetry breaking effects are much smaller .",
    "a first one is the suppression , when there is no trs , of a small `` weak localization '' correction to the average transmission @xmath150 , the second effect of removing trs is to halve the universal variance of @xmath143 .",
    "the large @xmath15 limit of the density @xmath151 @xmath152 can be calculated using an equation derived by dyson @xcite @xmath153 taking the @xmath140 characterizing the three circular ensembles for @xmath0 , one gets for the ensemble averaged total transmission : @xmath154 the term @xmath155 is obvious : having chaotic scattering , the probability to be reflected equals the probability to be transmitted .",
    "however there is a small correction of order @xmath156 which reduces by @xmath157 @xmath143 when there is trs and srs , which disappears without trs and which enhances @xmath143 by a factor @xmath158 without srs .",
    "this is the analog in a quantum billiard of the well - known weak - localization corrections to the boltzmann - drude conductance of a disordered system .",
    "one of the main phenomena which is naturally explained by random matrix theory @xcite are the `` universal conductance fluctuations '' ( ucf ) characterizing mesoscopic conductors .",
    "when one varies the `` conductance '' @xmath143 with an external parameter ( fermi wave length , magnetic field ... ) one generates fluctuations of magnitude independent of @xmath159 . to calculate @xmath160",
    "one needs to know the density - density correlation function of the @xmath161-parameters . in the limit @xmath162",
    ", one can simply calculate @xcite this variance . exploiting the coulomb gas analogy , one can write @xmath163 as a functional derivative : @xmath164 when @xmath162 , @xmath165 ( this amounts to neglect the term responsible for the weak localization correction in eq .",
    "( [ dyson ] ) . in the large @xmath15-limit ,",
    "@xmath140 becomes a linear functional of @xmath166 .",
    "this implies an important result : @xmath167 depends only on the nature of the pairwise repulsion between the radial parameters and becomes independent of the confining potential @xmath168 .",
    "the evaluation of the functional derivative giving @xmath169 is straightforward : @xmath170 to eventually give @xmath171 for the variance @xmath172 of a linear statistics @xmath173 of the @xmath161-parameter .",
    "taking @xmath174 , one gets @xmath175 the variance of @xmath143 is just a number which depends on @xmath141 but not on @xmath159 .",
    "when @xmath15 is finite , weak localization corrections and variances can be exactly calculated using a method introduced by mehta , gaudin and dyson . using a set of orthogonal polynomials ( @xmath74 ) or shew - orthogonal polynomials ( @xmath176 ) , one can perform the integration of @xmath177 over an arbitrary set of @xmath161-parameters in order to have @xmath178 , @xmath179 and higher order correlation functions .",
    "going to the variables @xmath180 the polynomials required @xcite to perform the integrals for @xmath74 are the legendre polynomials .",
    "so far , we have done the simplest random matrix exercise where all the scatterers are taken with a uniform distribution .",
    "those circular ensembles are suitable to describe scattering in zero - dimensional chaotic cavities , as it has been numerically checked .",
    "another exactly solvable case is provided by a @xmath181 series of scatterers .",

    ", one can derive a fokker - planck equation @xcite for @xmath196 : @xmath197 in this statistical description of @xmath1 ( or @xmath0 ) , the radial parameters and the matrices @xmath193 are statistically uncorrelated .",
    "the @xmath193 remain distributed with haar measure over the @xmath40 unitary group . increasing the number @xmath194 of blocks put in series only changes the statistics of the radial parameters as given by the above fokker - planck equation , this is the limitation of this `` isotropic '' model which allows us to solve it entirely and to describe quasi-@xmath181 localization .",
    "but the transverse system dimensions appear only through the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "a strip of purely @xmath181 transverse section and a bar with a @xmath34 section are treated the same way : within the @xmath198 approximation for the transverse dynamics . when @xmath145 , @xmath199 and the resulting equation was originally derived @xcite in 1959 in a work entitled : `` waveguides with random inhomogeneities and brownian motion in the lobachevsky plane '' .",
    "the nature of the fokker - planck equation was indeed correctly identified as a `` heat equation in a space of negative curvature '' .",
