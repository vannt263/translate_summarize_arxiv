    "dynamical systems with time - delayed feedback show interesting phenomena which are relevant to a broad spectrum of research fields , such as nonlinear dynamics  @xcite , laser physics  @xcite , neurobiology  @xcite , chaos control  @xcite , synchronization  @xcite and communication  @xcite .",
    "the mathematics of delayed differential equations is less developed and not as understood as that of ordinary ones  @xcite .",
    "hence the theoretical analysis of delayed feedback currently attracts a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "most of the research on time delayed systems concentrates on deterministic systems .",
    "however stochastic systems with time - delayed feedback are discussed as well , for instance , in the context of gene regulation @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a simple discrete model with delay : a stochastic process for a single binary variable which evolves according to its own history .",
    "we show that this model can be mapped onto a two - dimensional stochastic cellular automaton in such a way that the time - delayed couplings become local . as a result",
    ", the autocorrelation function of the corresponding time series is related to the critical properties of directed percolation .",
    "our results are however more general and may be applied to a large variety of systems .",
    "we consider a time series @xmath0 with a discrete time variable @xmath5 that evolves by non - local stochastic updates @xmath6 in such a way that the probability for the outcome @xmath0 is given by @xmath7 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are two different delays .",
    "the initial configuration may be given by specifying @xmath3 subsequent elements of the time series , e.g. @xmath8 .",
    "the type of data represented by @xmath0 as well as the function @xmath9 is not restricted in any way ; the only important ingredient is that a new entry of the time series @xmath0 depends on the previous values at times @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "here we show that irrespective of the structure of @xmath0 and @xmath9 , it is possible to rearrange the time series in such a way that the couplings become local in a two - dimensional representation .",
    "more specifically , we show that it is possible to define a reordered series @xmath12 that evolves by updates @xmath13 with @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a different delay that switches between the values @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "the only condition for this transformation to work is that the original delays  @xmath3 and  @xmath4 have to be coprime , i.e. , they have no common divisor other than  @xmath16 .",
    "the reordered time series @xmath12 is related to the original one by @xmath18 where the map @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 in this equation @xmath21 denotes integer division by @xmath3 while @xmath22 is an integer such that @xmath23 note that the existence of @xmath24 requires @xmath3 and @xmath4 to be coprime .",
    "the condition of coprimality of @xmath3 and @xmath4 guarantees that the mapping is one - to - one with the inverse @xmath25 coprimality should not be seen as a shortcoming of the mapping since the number of coprimes to a given @xmath3 , as given by the euler s totient function @xmath26 , is known to increase sufficiently rapidly ( faster than @xmath27 ) so that in the large @xmath3 limit the transformation can be applied to systems with various delays @xmath4 .    to understand this transformation ,",
    "the time line should be thought of as being divided into equidistant blocks of size @xmath3 .",
    "the transformation simply reorders the time indices in each block .",
    "this reordering takes place in the first term on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hoye ] ) while the second term simply enumerates the blocks in such a way that they do not mix .",

    "one starts out with a given configuration @xmath34 . from this initial condition",
    "the whole time series can be constructed by iteration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : updatingrule ] ) . applying the transformation",
    "( [ eq : hoye ] ) the first @xmath3 sites are reordered by @xmath35 the same reordering scheme takes place in the subsequent blocks . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : visual ] , this transformation preserves the long delay @xmath3 while the short delay @xmath4 is mapped onto @xmath16 or @xmath17 . in the appendix",
    "we prove that this is also true in the general case as long as @xmath3 and @xmath4 are coprime .",
    "the main purpose of the mapping described above is to arrange the reordered time series in a 1 + 1-dimensional plane in such a way that the interactions become local .",
    "following giacomelli and politi  @xcite the time series is divided into equidistant segments of @xmath3 elements which are arranged line by line on top of each other .",
    "this means that the index @xmath36 is mapped to the position @xmath37 obviously this procedure turns the long delay  @xmath3 into a local interaction . for example , drawing the original time series @xmath0 in such a 1 + 1-dimensional representation the long delay @xmath3 turns into a nearest - neighbor interaction in vertical direction while the short delay is still non - local ( see fig .

    "[ fig : transformedlattice ] are local , they are still biased towards north - east .",
    "moreover , the coupling scheme exhibits vertical dislocation lines . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : distortedlattice ] , these irregularities can be removed by redrawing the figure in such a way that all updates have the same orientation in the @xmath41-plane .",
    "this representation allows one to relate the original time series with 1 + 1-dimensional cellular automata on a tilted square lattice .",
    "however , by rearranging the lattice one obtains skewed boundary conditions with a _ non - local delay _ connecting blocks with vertical distance @xmath42 .    to demonstrate how the transformation works",
    "let us consider a simple deterministic update rule where @xmath43 is a binary time series .",
    "the update rule is given by the boolean function @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes a logical xor .",
    "such a binary time series can be visualized by plotting @xmath0 as black and white pixels at position @xmath46 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sp ] , where we used the delays @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "starting with a single non - zero entry in the initial state @xmath49 the iteration of the update rule ( [ eq : updatingrule ] ) produces an irregular pattern of pixels , which is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sp ] . applying the transformation  ( [ eq : hoye ] )",
    "the pixels are ordered with a bias to the north - east , resulting in a tilted sierpinsky gasket ( see middle panel ) . finally , plotting the same data in such a way that the tilt is removed one obtains the usual form of the sierpinsky gasket ( see lower panel ) . however , as exemplified by the arrow , the boundary conditions are no longer periodic , instead they involve a non - local shift @xmath50 in vertical direction .",
    "let us now turn to a simple but non - trivial example of a _ stochastic _ update rule . for a binary time series a probabilistic update @xmath6 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : updatingrule ] ) is determined by @xmath51 with four control paramters @xmath52 . in what follows",
    "let us assume that @xmath53 . in this case",
    "the time series consisting of zeroes is a fixed point of the dynamics . in non - equilibrium",
    "statistical physics such a configuration which can be reached but not be left is called an absorbing state . whether or not this absorbing state is stable against perturbations depends on the magnitude of the remaining control parameter @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "for example , setting @xmath56 and varying @xmath57 between @xmath58 and @xmath16 one observes the following phenomenological behavior :    * if @xmath57 is very small the time series quickly approaches the absorbing series consisting of zeroes . * for large @xmath57 the dynamics approaches a fluctuating steady state with a non - vanshing stationary expectation value of  @xmath0 . the probability to reach",
    "the absorbing configuration is very low and decreases with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "* at a certain threshold @xmath59 one observes a power - law decay of the density in a finite temporal range which grows with @xmath3 .",
    "this behavior reminds of a non - equilibrium phase transition from a fluctuating phase into an absorbing state .",
    "in fact , using the transformation  ( [ eq : hoye ] ) the update rule becomes equivalent to that of a domany - kinzel cellular automaton  @xcite , which is known to exhibit a second - order phase transition belonging to the universality class of directed percolation ( dp )  @xcite . using the present notation",
    "the 1 + 1-dimensional domany - kinzel model is defined on a tilted square lattice with coordinates @xmath46 .",
    "each lattice site can be either active ( @xmath60 ) or inactive ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the model evolves by parallel updates , i.e. the new horizontal line at @xmath62 is obtained by setting @xmath63 for the choice @xmath64 and @xmath65 the domany - kinzel model reduces to directed bond percolation .",
    "this model is known to exhibit a continuous phase transition belonging to the universality class of directed percolation at the critical point @xmath66 if the system size is infinite .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : dp ] , the transformation  ( [ eq : hoye ] ) maps an apparently disordered time series into an ordered one , where typical dp cluster can be seen .",
    "it should be stressed that in the present model the corresponding dp process takes place on a _ finite _ lattice so that for any finite @xmath3 there is no phase transition in a strict sense .",
    "nevertheless it is possible to observe the typical signatures of dp critical behavior within a certain temporal range which grows with @xmath3 , as will be shown in the following .",
    "two - point correlation function of the time series @xmath67 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : twpoint ] ) .",
    "the dashed line demonstrates that the spike peaks decay as @xmath68 .",
    "the inset shows a zoom of the first and the last spike.,width=321 ]    in order to see a signature of dp critical behavior we tried to identify the critical exponents in 1 + 1 dimensions @xmath69 to this end we iterated the time series slightly above the critical point @xmath70 and measured the connected part of the two - point correlation function @xmath71 before the average was taken the time series was equilibrated over @xmath72 iterations in order to reach a stationary state .",
    "moreover , we chose a very large delay @xmath73 to prevent the system from entering the zero sequence due to finite - size effects .",
    "figure  [ fig : dpcorr ] shows a train of spikes at regularly spaced times @xmath74 which are caused by correlations between subsequent rows in the two - dimensional representation .",
    "the asymptotic envelope of these spikes seems to obey an asymptotic power law @xmath75 with an exponent @xmath76 .",
    "the relation to dp predicts this exponent to be given by @xmath77 a similar attempt to obtain the spatial correlation exponent @xmath78 from the form of a single spike ( see inset ) fails .",
    "this can be explained as follows . in the central panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dp ] the form of the spike would correspond to a correlation function in horizontal direction , whereas in the symmetrized representation shown in the right panel this correlation function would be tilted .",
    "therefore , the spike profile is given by an interplay of both exponents @xmath79 and @xmath80 , making it difficult to distinguish between them .",

    "the iteration starts with a single active seed @xmath84 .",
    "after reordering the time series and representing it in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dp ] , we measure the density @xmath85 in vertical distance @xmath86 and horizontal distance @xmath87 from the seed .",
    "since the pair connectedness function is known to obey the scaling form @xmath88 with a universal scaling function @xmath89 , the exponents can be determined by plotting @xmath90 versus @xmath91 in such a way that data sets for different values of @xmath87 collapse .",
    "plugging in the known exponents of dp one obtains a convincing data collapse , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dpcollapse ] .",
    "this confirms unambiguously the critical behavior we expected to get .",
    "in this paper we have shown how a time series evolving according to a nonlocal update rule can be mapped onto a local process in two dimensions with special time - delayed boundary conditions .",
    "one interesting question is whether this result holds also for the continuous case .",

    "first we show that two sites of the time series separated by a time delay of @xmath100 are still separated by the same delay after the transformation .",
