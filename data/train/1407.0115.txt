    "strongly turbulent magnetic fields arise due to mri and their stress transports the angular momentum @xcite . recently",
    ", numerical simulations of mri in collisionless plasma have been performed , and high - energy protons are shown to be generated by magnetic reconnection induced by mri @xcite .",
    "these high - energy protons are expected to interact with thermal protons and generate neutrons and pions , @xmath3 where x represents multiple pions . while thermal protons are confined by the strong turbulent magnetic fields",
    ", the neutrons can escape from the accretion flow because of the charge neutrality if their life times are longer than their escape times @xcite .",
    "a @xmath4 decays into two photons , and a @xmath5 decays into three neutrinos and a positron . since photons and neutrinos are not trapped by the magnetic fields , they will also escape from the accretion flows .",
    "in addition , high - energy protons can have much larger mean free paths than the thermal protons and can escape from the flow through their diffusive motions .",

    "we solve the six differential equations , ( [ eq : eoc ] ) , ( [ eq : eomphi ] ) , ( [ eq : eomr2 ] ) , ( [ eq : epth ] ) , ( [ eq : nhe ] ) , and ( [ eq : uhe ] ) for @xmath130 and @xmath67 .",
    "we calculate the time evolution of these equations until a steady state solution is realized rather than solve the equations with steady assumption because the former method has some advantages over the latter .",

    "we assume that there is a rotationally supported flow at the outer boundary @xmath137 , i.e. , we set the outer boundary of tps as @xmath138 these boundary conditions make the viscous dissipation rates large , which are expected to induce the large injection rates .",
    "we confirm that the results are almost unchanged if we set a slowly rotating outer boundary , such as @xmath139 . for heps",

    "the observations suggest that lorentz factors of the jets are typically @xmath10 , and that their luminosities are broadly distributed over @xmath269 @xcite . as described in section [ sec : intro ] , if the energy source of a jet is gravitational energy that is released by mass accretion , some mechanisms that concentrate the energy on a small fraction of mass are necessary in order to produce relativistic jets .",
    "it is likely that the gravitational energy is converted to poynting and/or kinetic energies and they are injected into the polar region above the smbh , `` the funnel '' , where the gas is very dilute due to the centrifugal barrier .",

    "heps that escape from the accretion flows are likely to inject some amount of kinetic energy and mass in the funnel , which is available to launch the kinetically dominated jet .",
    "although the escaping particles are considered to be isotropic , we discuss the case with the most efficient injection in which all the escaping particles are injected in the funnel .",

    "they estimate @xmath279 and @xmath280 .",
    "the total rates including the neutrons that do not decay in the funnel , i.e. , the isotropic escaping rates , are around @xmath281 , which is slightly larger than those in our models .",

    "our model does not include the spectrum of heps that is considered to affect escaping rates of heps . in order to clarify injection rates of mass and kinetic energy",
    ", we should construct a more realistic model ( see subsection [ sec : ignored ] ) .      in this paper ,",
    "we have ignored effects of the electron component and radiation from thermal component . if electrons obtain large amount of thermal energy , they radiate the energy away by synchrotron emission and bremsstrahlung . under the assumption that electrons obtain thermal energy from protons by coulomb collisions and that electrons are non - relativistic , the timescale of energy transport from protons to electrons is estimated as ( cf . * ? ? ?",

    "many studies on accretion flows with the multi - dimensional simulations show that the disk winds are very common phenomena ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "typically , injection scale of the turbulent magnetic fields , which is around the scale height of the accretion flow , is about 10 orders of magnitude larger than gyration scale of heps @xcite .",
    "this difference between two scales is expected to make the turbulent fields very weak at the gyration scale of heps .",
    "thus , bohm limit that corresponds to @xmath303 is unlikely to be suitable in the accretion flows , and we have used @xmath304 .",
    "we note that acceleration of heps is inefficient for large @xmath87 because large @xmath87 means that heps rarely interact with the turbulent magnetic fields .",

    "we assume monoenergetic heps in order to use the moment equations of the diffusion convection equation .",
    "actually , heps have energy spectra that are determined by acceleration , escape , and cooling processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we also calculate luminosities of escaping particles such as protons , the neutrons , the gamma - rays , and the neutrinos .",
    "we formulate a one - dimensional model of the two component accretion flow consisting of the thermal particles and the high - energy particles .",

    "we assume that injection rates of high - energy particles are related to heating rates of thermal particles .",
    "we obtain steady state solutions by solving the time evolution of these equations . without high - energy particles ,",
    "we obtain advection dominated solutions that have features consistent with those obtained by previous studies . including high - energy particles , we also obtains advection dominated flows , and effects of high - energy particles on the flow structure turn out to be small even if the pressure of high - energy particles dominates over the thermal pressure . for a model in which escape of high - energy protons takes away almost all energy ,",
    "the accretion flow has the keplerian angular momentum , slow infall velocity , and large surface density .",

    "<S> we study effects of high - energy particles on the accretion flows onto a supermassive black hole and luminosities of escaping particles such as protons , neutrons , gamma - rays , and neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> we formulate a one - dimensional model of the two - component accretion flow consisting of thermal particles and high - energy particles , supposing that some fraction of the released energy is converted to the acceleration of the high - energy particles . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal component is governed by fluid dynamics while the high - energy particles obey the moment equations of the diffusion - convection equation . by solving the time evolution of these equations , we obtain advection dominated flows as the steady state solutions . </S>",
    "<S> effects of the high - energy particles on the flow structures turn out to be small even if the pressure of the high - energy particles dominates over the thermal pressure . for a model </S>",
    "<S> in which the escaping protons take away almost all the released energy , the high - energy particles have large influence enough to make the flow have the keplerian angular velocity at the inner region . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the luminosities of the escaping particles for these steady solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the escaping particles can extract the energy from about @xmath0 to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mass accretion rates . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosities of the escaping particles depend on the parameters such as the injection lorentz factors , the mass accretion rates , and the diffusion coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss some implications on the relativistic jet production by the escaping particles . </S>"
