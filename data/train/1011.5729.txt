    "the sample covariance matrix plays an important role in multivariate analysis since it is an unbiased estimator of the population covariance matrix and , more importantly , many statistics in multivariate statistical analysis ( e.g. , principle component analysis , factor analysis and multivariate regression analysis ) can be expressed as functionals of the empirical spectral distributions of sample covariance matrices . the _ empirical spectral distribution _ ( esd ) of a symmetric ( or hermitian , in the complex case ) @xmath9 matrix @xmath8 is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the eigenvalues of @xmath8 .",
    "assuming that the magnitude of the dimension @xmath12 is proportional to the sample size @xmath13 , we will study a simplified version of sample covariance matrices , @xmath14 since @xmath15 and @xmath16 have the same liming properties , according to theorem 11.43 in @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a review of this field .",
    "the first success in finding the limiting spectral distribution ( lsd ) of sample covariance matrices is due to to marenko and pastur @xcite .",

    "the commonly used method to study the convergence of @xmath15 is the _ stieltjes transform _ , which is defined for any distribution function @xmath25 by @xmath26    it is easy to see that @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the conjugate of the complex number  @xmath29 .",
    "as is known , the stieltjes transform of the mp law @xmath30 is the unique solution to the equation @xmath31 for each @xmath32 in the set @xmath33 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath34 here , and in the sequel , @xmath35 denotes the square root of the complex number @xmath29 with positive imaginary part .    using a berry  esseen - type inequality established in terms of stieltjes transforms ,",
    "bai @xcite was able to show that the convergence rate of @xmath36 to @xmath37 is @xmath38 or @xmath39 , according to whether @xmath40 is close to @xmath41 or not . in @xcite ,",
    "bai , miao and tsay improved these rates in the case of the convergence in probability .",
    "later , bai , miao and yao @xcite proved that @xmath15 converges to @xmath37 at a rate of @xmath42 in probability and @xmath43 a.s .",
    "when @xmath44 is away from 1 ; when @xmath44 is close to 1 , both rates are @xmath45 .",
    "the exact convergence rate still remains unknown for the esd of sample covariance matrices .",
    "instead of studying the convergence rate directly , bai and silverstein @xcite considered the limiting distribution of the linear spectral statistics ( lss ) of the general form of sample covariance matrices , indexed by a set of functions analytic on an open region covering the support of the lsd .",

    "bai and silverstein proved the central limit theorem ( clt ) for the lss , @xmath50 their result is very useful for testing large - dimensional hypotheses .",
    "however , the analytic assumption on @xmath51 seems inflexible in practical applications because in many cases of application , the kernel functions @xmath51 can only be defined on the real line , instead of on the complex plane . on the other hand ,",
    "it is proved in @xcite that the clt of lss does not hold for indicator functions .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask what the weakest continuity condition is that should be imposed on the kernel functions so that the clt of the lss holds . for the clt for other types of matrices , one can refer to @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the clt for @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes any open interval including @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath54 denotes the set of functions @xmath55 which have continuous fourth order derivatives .",
