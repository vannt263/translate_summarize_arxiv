    "for photocatalysis , titanium dioxide ( tio@xmath0 ) offers excellent oxidation and charge transport properties together with its wide availability , nontoxicity , and chemical stability . for this reason",
    ", it finds many useful applications such as photogeneration of hydrogen from water , degradation of pollutants under visible light irradiation and production of hydrocarbon fuels and dye sensitized solar cells ( dssc).@xcite among the other polymorphs the anatase phase exhibits higher catalytic activity.@xcite    one important limitation is that anatase tio@xmath0 has a wide band gap of @xmath13.2 ev  @xcite and can only absorb in the ultraviolet ( uv ) region ( @xmath2380 nm ) .",
    "this seriously reduces solar energy utilization to @xmath15% .",
    "substitutional cation and/or anion modified titania has been proposed as an effective approach to get catalytic activity under visible light irradiation.@xcite recent experiments have shown that cr - n codoping in tio@xmath0 drastically enhances absorbance.@xcite moreover , cr and cr - n dopings were reported to increase the visible light reactivity with increasing cr incorporation .",
    "@xcite ferromagnetism has also been observed in cr doped anatase films.@xcite theoretical studies predicted magnetization per cr much larger than experimental findings.@xcite pure density functional theory ( dft ) methods unreliably estimate half - metallic character for cr doped tio@xmath0@xcite . for the optical properties , hybrid theoretical approaches has been recently used to get improved quantitative agreement with the experimental data.@xcite detailed electronic structure investigations are still needed to get a proper description of band gap features for the doped systems .    in this present work ,",
    "we used screened coulomb potential hybrid dft calculations to investigate the modifications of the band gap properties of tio@xmath0 induced by cr and cr - n dopants and their effect on the corresponding absorption spectra .",
    "formation energies have been calculated as a function of oxygen chemical potential to compare thermodynamical statbility of the doped structures .",
    "we also obtained the magnetic moments and the charge states of cr and n species .",
    "for all systems , our calculations were performed based on the spin polarized hybrid density functional theory as implemented in the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp).@xcite ionic cores and valence electrons were treated by projector - augmented waves ( paw ) method.@xcite the kinetic energy cutoff value was determined to be 400 ev .",
    "pure dft describes impurity and defect associated properties of transition metal oxides incorrectly .",
    "for example , tio@xmath0 is predicted to be metallic in oxygen vacancy cases.@xcite however , experimental studies show a semiconducting nature .",
    "this failure of dft lies in the approximations to the exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy being usually local or semilocal .",
    "this flaw can be patched by using hybrid methods where a portion of the non - local exact exchange is admixed with the traditional semilocal exchange .",
    "we used the heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof hybrid xc functional ( hse06 )  @xcite based on screened coulomb potential reducing the self - interaction error .",
    "technically , this results in a rapid spatial decay of hf exchange which improves the convergence behavior of self - consistent iterations .",
    "the hse exchange is derived from the pbe0@xcite exchange by range separation and then by cancellation of counteracting long range hf and pbe contributions , as , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the range separation parameter for the screening and @xmath5 is the mixing coefficient .",
    "the parameter of @xmath4=0.2 @xmath6 is used for the exchange contributions as suggested for the hse06 functional.@xcite we determined the mixing ratio of the exact exchange to be 22% so that calculated band gaps and lattice constants for both the anatase and the rutile polymorphs show good agreement with the experimental values.@xcite    in order to model the doped systems we constructed a 108-atom supercell by 3@xmath73@xmath71 replication of the conventional anatase unit cell .",
    "this structure is sufficiently large to accommodate spatial separation between the periodic images of the defects .",
    "we traced all possible cr and n doping configurations .",
    "in particular , for cr / n codoping , the structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is found to be energetically the most favorable . for geometry optimization and density of states ( dos ) calculations we used 8 special @xmath8-points to perform the brillouin zone integrations .",
    "the calculated properties are converged such that they unnoticeably change when a higher @xmath8-point sampling is used .",
    "we required a precision of 0.015 ev /  in the residual forces in every spatial component on all the atoms without fixing them to their bulk positions .",
    "the formation energies of the defects were calculated by using the formula , @xmath9 where e@xmath10 ( e@xmath11 ) is the total energy of doped ( pure ) supercell .",
    "the chemical potentials of cr , n , ti and o are denoted by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively . depending on the presence of cr ( n ) substitutional dopant ,",
    "the number @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) assumes values 0 or 1 . in thermodynamical equilibrium ,",
    "the chemical potentials of ti and o varies depending on the growth environment and must also satisfy the restriction @xmath18 . under o - rich conditions ,",
    "@xmath15 is taken from molecular oxygen , and then @xmath19 . under ti - rich conditions , @xmath14 is derived from bulk ( hcp ) ti ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath15 is calculated from @xmath21 .",
    "the remaining chemical potentials of cr and n are taken from their natural phases ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "bader analysis quantitatively describes local charge depletion / accumulation .",
    "it involves integration of bader volumes around atomic centers .",
    "these volumes are partitions of the real space delimited by local zero - flux surfaces of charge density gradient vector field .",
    "we calculated charge states of atomic species ( in table  [ table1 ] ) using a grid based decomposition algorithm.@xcite    .average charge states ( @xmath24 ) of dopants and their adjecent ( nn ) ti and o atoms from bader analysis.[table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the bulk properties of pure anatase were calculated using the 108-atom supercell .",
    "our hse - predicted lattice parameters ( @xmath25  , @xmath26  ) and band gap value ( 3.23 ev in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) show remarkable agreement with the experimental data .",
    "since nitrogen doping case has been discussed in detail elsewhere,@xcite we will focus on cr and cr - n doped anatase to elucidate the role of cr in photoelectrochemistry of tio@xmath0 .    _ * cr - doped tio@xmath0 :* _ experiments report incorporation of chromium at substitutional sites forming single - crystalline cr - doped tio@xmath0.@xcite they also conclude that if chromium oxide forms it must be highly dispersed and its size must be undetectably small.@xcite in order to model the structure we substituted one cr atom at a ti site in the anatase supercell forming sixfold coordination with the nearest neighbor oxygens as shown in fig .",
    "all cr - o bonds are 1.90  and slightly shortened relative to those of the undoped tio@xmath0 .",
    "the disturbance of the substitutional cr on the lattice is very small agreeing with the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns.@xcite under o - rich conditions , the formation energy of cr@ti doping has been calculated to be 1.06 ev ( in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "these energetics are sensitive to the choice of the xc functional .",
    "for example , mcdonnell _ et al .",
    "_ found a value of 0.36 ev with hse06-pbesol method.@xcite under ti - rich conditions the formation energy gets as large as 10.21 ev .",
    "therefore , synthesis of substitutional cr under o - rich conditions must be much easier as pointed out by previous calculations.@xcite    substitutional cr introduces @xmath27 states which are dominant above the top of the valence band ( vb ) as presented in the corresponding projected dos ( pdos ) of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for the minority spin component",
    ", fully occupied cr @xmath27 states appear isolated 1.07 ev above the valence band maximum ( vbm ) .",
    "our calculations are interestingly in agreement with the x - ray photoemission spectra ( xps ) of osterwalder _ _ et al.__@xcite who reported the formation of defect states at 1.0 ev above the vbm giving an intensity roughly proportional to the cr concentration .",
    "functional not only gives the relative positions of the defect states in the band gap but also better describes the character of these states .",
    "for instance , unlike the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) calculations of ye  _ et al._.@xcite and lda study of peng  _ et al .",
    "_ , our hse06 results predict cr doped anatase to be semiconducting , not half - metallic .",
    "chromium significantly modifies the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) , too , by introducing empty cr @xmath27 states at the bottom of the cb . widely dispersing cr - induced states effectively reduce the calculated band gap from 3.23 ev to a value of 2.16(2.14 ) ev for the spin up(down ) component .",
    "this band gap narrowing agrees well with the decrease of the binding energy of cr @xmath27 from 3.2 ev to 2.20 ev observed in the xps spectra.@xcite depending of the choice of xc flavor , the band gap reduction was calculated by the previous theoretical studies to be 1.2 ev,@xcite and 0.34 ev@xcite with flapw and hse06-pbesol methods , respectively .",
    "xps core level and valence band data show that the majority of cr is present in the @xmath28 charge state.@xcite in addition , the room temperature magnetization measurements reveal a ferromagnetic state for all cr - doped anatase films , with a saturation magnetic moment of @xmath10.6 @xmath29 per cr atom.@xcite similarly , zhang  _ et al . _ reported cr@xmath30-associated ferromagnetism which increases up to @xmath10.42 @xmath29/cr by lowering of oxygen pressures.@xcite theoretical studies , on the other hand , predicted a charge state of @xmath31 with a magnetization of 2 @xmath29.@xcite the discrepancy has been attributed to the possible presence of oxygen vacancies which leave excess charge in the samples reducing the charge state from cr@xmath32 to cr@xmath30 .",
    "however , without such a compensation , our hse - calculated charge state of @xmath33 and total magnetic moment of 1.21 @xmath29 per cr show a significant improvement over the existing theoretical estimations .",
    "* _ cr / n - codoped tio@xmath0 : _ * substitutional codoping of cr and n in the anatase form has been confirmed by xrd measurements for various impurity concentrations.@xcite initially , we considered all possible doping configurations .",
    "after the relaxation , the cr - n pairing shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](g - h ) yields the lowest total energy .",
    "the lattice gets slightly disturbed because of the strong cr - n interaction leading to a bond length of 1.62  which is considerably shorter than the ti - n bonding . the total charge density plots in fig .  [ fig1](g ) and fig .",
    "[ fig1](f ) clearly shows the covalent character of cr - n coupling while ti - n bonding is more polarized .",
    "we calculated the formation energy for cr / n codoping to be 4.43 ev under o - rich conditions .",
    "it rises up to 8.93 ev under o - poor growth environment as shown in fig .",
    "the experimental realization of cr - n codoping is expected to be energetically viable under oxidizing atmosphere in agreement with previous studies.@xcite    the presence of substitutional n in the codoped anatase phase reduces the calculated magnetic moment to 1.00 @xmath29 relative to the case of cr monodoping .",
    "besides , it insignificantly alters the charge state of cr which is @xmath34 as presented in table .",
    "[ table1 ] .",
    "this indicates a strong delocalization of n @xmath35 states over tio@xmath0 bands .",
    "the uv - vis reflectance spectral measurements of li _ _ et al.__@xcite and the x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) of chiodi _ _ et al.__@xcite confirm the presence of cr@xmath30 species .",
    "our hse - calculated charge state is reasonably closer than the previous dft+u predicted mulliken charges on the substitutional cr when n dopant is present.@xcite    strong cr - n pair interaction exhibits interesting features in the electronic properties in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "first , the isolated impurity states associated with cr @xmath27 and n @xmath35 in the ( cr@ti ) and ( n@o ) monodoping cases mutually passivate each other giving a clean band gap .",
    "this eliminates the possiblility of photo - generated charge recombination due to well localized trap states .",
    "secondly , the cr and n concentration of @xmath10.93% in the computational cell causes a band gap reduction of 0.3 ev .",
    "_ calculated 2.66 ev band gap for cr / n codoping by using hse06-pbesol xc functional.@xcite chiodi _",
    "_ reported the appearance of codoping - induced and cr @xmath27 dominant states at the top of the vb which translates to a band gap of 2.8 ev.@xcite this observation nicely fits in our pdos structure in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with an estimated band gap of 2.9 ev . for higher dopant concentrations ,",
    "experiments report increased gap narrowing causing significantly red - shifted optical absorption.@xcite thirdly , n @xmath35 states which appear in the monodoping case ( n@o ) in fig .  [ fig2 ] significantly delocalize over the vb and the cb when cr is present ( cr / n ) due to strong cr - n interaction .",
    "this pdos feature shows remarkable agreement with the experimental observations.@xcite therefore , n has a weaker effect on the optical response than cr which dominantly modifies the band edges of tio@xmath0 .",
    "we calculated the absorption spectra of cr- and cr / n - doped cases in comparison with pure anatase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "cr seems to be absorbing in the visible region significantly better than the cr - n codoping .",
    "however , pdos structure of cr@ti shows that the overall photocatalytic efficiency might be lower than the cr / n case due to the charge recombination in the presence of localized @xmath27 gap states .",
    "in fact , cr - n codoped tio@xmath0 exhibits relatively higher catalytic reactivity under visible light irradiation.@xcite",
    "the electronic , magnetic and optical properties of cr- and cr / n - doped anatase tio@xmath0 have been investigated by means of screen coulomb hybrid calculations .",
    "hybrid functionals incorporating exact exchange terms not only improve the description of defect states but also are promising to predict magnetization properties of @xmath36-band dopants . we have shown the dominant character of cr in modifying the band edges of anatase . substitutional cr with or without n is very effective in band gap reduction causing significant red - shift of the absorption edge into the visible spectral region . isolated n @xmath35 states get delocalized over tio@xmath0 bands due to mutual passivation by cr @xmath27 states giving a clean band gap for cr / n - codoping .",
    "thus , the enhancement of the optical absorption is emergent .",
    "moreover , the calculations imply that the substitutional cr and n pair reduces electron - hole recombination rate improving the overall photocatalytic performance .",
