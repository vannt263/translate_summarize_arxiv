    "<S> we derive the conservative secular evolution of precessing compact binaries to second post - newtonian order accuracy , with leading - order spin - orbit , spin - spin and mass quadrupole - monopole contributions included . </S>",
    "<S> the emerging closed system of first - order differential equations evolves the pairs of polar and azimuthal angles of the spin and orbital angular momentum vectors together with the periastron angle . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with the instantaneous dynamics , the secular dynamics is autonomous . </S>",
    "<S> this secular dynamics reliably characterizes the system over timescales starting from a few times the radial period to several precessional periods , but less than the radiation reaction timescale . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically compare the instantaneous and secular evolutions and estimate the number of periods for which dissipation has no significant effect , e.g. the conservative timescale . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the analytic equations to study the spin flip - flop effect , recently found by numerical relativity methods . </S>",
    "<S> our investigations show that the effect does not generalize beyond its original parameter settings , although we reveal distinct configurations exhibiting one half flip - flops . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find a flip - flopping evolution of the orbital angular momentum vector , which ventures from one pole to another through several precessional periods . </S>",
    "<S> this is a new effect , occurring for mass ratios much less than one . </S>"
