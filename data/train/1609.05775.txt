    "in the study of the formation and evaporation of black holes , various approximation schemes have often been adopted . in particular , as the surface of a collapsing star gets very close to the schwarzschild radius , pre - hawking radiation is expected to arise before the horizon emerges , but its back - reaction is conventionally ignored .",
    "we will show in this paper the significance of this back - reaction on geometry despite its extreme weakness .",
    "a new approach to black - hole formation and evaporation was proposed by kawai , matsuo and yokokura in 2013 @xcite .",
    "it allows us to study the space - time geometry for a collapsing sphere , _ without _ ignoring the back - reaction of pre - hawking radiation as a solution to the einstein equation .",
    "it was found that the back - reaction of pre - hawking radiation prevents the apparent horizon to emerge whenever there is complete evaporation @xcite . the proposal that pre - hawking radiation prevents the formation of horizon",
    "was also proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "various aspects of this new approach , including its generalization and its connection to the information loss paradox , have been discussed in the literature @xcite . while it was the special case of a matter sphere collapsing at the speed of light that was considered in the original paper @xcite",
    ", we shall refer to all models of black - hole formation and evaporation that are constructed following this new approach @xcite as the kmy model .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the geometry inside the collapsing sphere , generalizing the results of earlier papers @xcite . the metric of the full space - time is found for mass densities and collapsing velocities with arbitrary radial dependence .",
    "it allows us to clarify various misunderstandings about black - hole formation and evaporation .",
    "furthermore , we shall emphasize the notion of the asymptotic black hole , which refers to a universal asymptotic state of late - stage gravitational collapse .",
    "a generic gravitational collapse with a sufficiently large mass eventually evolves into a configuration which is almost indistinguishable from this asymptotic state , and , for a distant observer , it is also very difficult to distinguish it from a real black hole with horizon .    in sec.[kmy - model ] , we first review the kmy model , and then derive the red - shift factor inside a collapsing sphere for generic radial distributions of mass and velocity .",
    "the space - time metric for the collapsing sphere is given in sec.[geometry ] .",
    "we verify that the energy - momentum tensor involves no singularity at the surface of the collapsing sphere , and analyze the case of a sphere collapsing at the speed of light in more detail as an example .",
    "finally , we clarify misconceptions in sec.[misconceptions ] , and comment on implications of the kmy model in sec.[comments ] .",
    "the kmy model @xcite describes a gravitational collapse with the back - reaction of pre - hawking radiation taken into consideration .",
    "the major difference between the kmy model and the conventional model of black holes is the following . in the conventional model , it is assumed that hawking radiation ( as well as pre - hawking radiation ) exists only at distance , and the neighborhood of the horizon is a vacuum state .",
    "however , it was shown @xcite that this is not a consistent assumption . even if the horizon is in vacuum in the beginning",
    ", it will evolve into the state of a `` firewall '' at a later time . on the other hand",
    ", the kmy model assumes that the pre - hawking radiation contributes to the energy - momentum tensor in the einstein equation even at the surface of the collapsing sphere , when it is close to the schwarzschild radius .",
    "taking into account of the back - reaction of the pre - hawking radiation , one can show @xcite that the whole collapsing sphere can evaporate completely without apparent horizon .    in this paper",
    ", we shall make the following assumptions for simplicity and for technical convenience .",

    "the argument goes as follows .",
    "if there would be an event horizon , there must be some infalling light - like trajectories which are geodesically incomplete from the viewpoint of a distant observer ( in the coordinate patch of @xmath9 ) .",
    "if there would be an apparent ( but not event ) horizon , there must be a moment when certain infalling light - like trajectories cross over @xmath5 .",

    "it can be shown that @xmath5 shrinks at a speed faster than light as long as @xmath10 , it is thus impossible for infalling light - like geodesics to cross over @xmath5 within the coordinate patch of @xmath9 .",

    "let us also emphasize here that the assumption of complete evaporation is not necessary for most of the discussion below .",

    "<S> following earlier works on the kmy model of black - hole formation and evaporation , we construct the metric for a matter sphere in gravitational collapse , with the back - reaction of pre - hawking radiation taken into consideration . </S>",

    "<S> we find that a generic gravitational collapse asymptote to a universal configuration which resembles a black hole but without horizon . </S>",
    "<S> this approach clarifies several misunderstandings about black - hole formation and evaporation , and provides a new model for black - hole - like objects in the universe .    </S>",
