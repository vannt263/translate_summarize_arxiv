    "ever since the pioneering work of belavin , polyakov and zamolodchikov @xcite , two - dimensional conformal field theory has been at the forefront of much of the progress in modern mathematical physics .",
    "its application to the study of critical statistical models and string theory is well known , see @xcite for example , but it also provides the basic inspiration for the mathematical theory of vertex operator algebras .",
    "the simplest conformal field theories are constructed mathematically from irreducible representations of an infinite - dimensional symmetry algebra .",
    "however , recent attention to non - local observables for statistical models and string theories with fermionic degrees of freedom has led to the conclusion that the corresponding field - theoretic models require , in addition , certain reducible , but indecomposable , representations .",
    "such models have come to be known as _ logarithmic conformal field theories _ because the type of indecomposability required leads to logarithmic singularities in correlation functions .    as a field of study , logarithmic conformal",
    "field theory dates back to the works of rozansky and saleur on the @xmath13 ( or perhaps @xmath6 ) wess - zumino - witten model @xcite and that of gurarie on a fermionic ghost system @xcite related to the theory now known as symplectic fermions .",
    "since then , things have progressed rather rapidly with many of the standard features of rational conformal field theory now understood in the logarithmic setting . in particular , there are three fine reviews of the subject @xcite which focus on , among other things , modular transformations , module structure and boundary aspects , mostly for a family of theories related to symplectic fermions .",
    "each of these reviews are accounts of lectures given at a workshop in 2001 .",
    "the present review aims to build upon the state of knowledge summarised there , introducing the reader to some of the recent advances that seem to be converging towards a more unified picture of logarithmic conformal field theory .",
    "unfortunately , a detailed overview would require a rather lengthy book , hence we will restrict ourselves to foundational material and in - depth examples which we believe , hopefully without controversy , are `` archetypes '' for the discipline .",
    "we hope that our choice will give the reader a good sense of what structures logarithmic conformal field theory relies upon and what one can do with it .    in particular , we work almost entirely in the continuum , expecting that the reader is familiar with rational conformal field theory as described ( for example ) in @xcite , eschewing approaches based on statistical lattice models and conjectured scaling limits ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we also work , for the most part , with chiral algebras , even though it is well known that the holomorphic factorisation principle of rational conformal field theory fails in the logarithmic setting .",
    "instead , we will see how to construct physically satisfactory non - chiral fields , even when logarithmic behaviour is present . for other approaches to logarithmic conformal field theory , as well as condensed matter physics and string - theoretic applications , discussions of logarithmic vertex operator algebras and other relations to mathematics",
    ", we refer to the other articles that constitute this special issue of the journal of physics a.    we will outline what we cover in this review shortly .",
    "first however , we quickly remind the reader how logarithmic singularities arise in correlation functions as consequences of a non - diagonalisable action of the virasoro zero - mode @xmath14 . then",
    ", we digress slightly in recalling the ( non - logarithmic ) theory known as the free boson , in particular , its characters , their modular transformations and the relation between these and the fusion rules ( the verlinde formula @xcite ) .",
    "this is in order to set the scene for the analysis of the `` archetypal '' logarithmic theories that follow .",
    "we also mention simple currents for the free boson and the corresponding extended algebra theories as these ideas will also play an important role for us .",
    "conformal field theory is relatively tractable among physical models due to its infinite - dimensional algebra of symmetries .",
    "as is well - known , this always includes the virasoro algebra , the infinite - dimensional lie algebra spanned by modes @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 with commutation relations @xmath18 } = { { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft } ( m - n { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright } ) } l_{m+n } + \\frac{m^3-m}{12 } \\delta_{m+n=0 } c , \\qquad { \\bigl [ l_m , c \\bigr ] } = 0.\\ ] ] the central mode @xmath17 will act on all representations as a fixed multiple of the identity , known as the central charge @xmath19 .",

    "we recall how the global conformal invariance of the vacuum @xmath21 , meaning its annihilation by @xmath22 , @xmath14 and @xmath23 , fixes the two - point functions of ( chiral ) fields and gives rise to logarithmic singularities when the corresponding virasoro representations admit a non - diagonalisable action of @xmath14 . given any chiral field @xmath24 , the natural action of the virasoro modes is given by @xmath25 } = \\oint_w { t { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft } ( z { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright } ) } { \\phi { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft } ( w { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright } ) } z^{n+1 } \\ : \\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}z}{2 \\pi { \\mathfrak{i}}}.\\ ] ] if @xmath24 is a chiral primary field of conformal weight @xmath26 , then this action gives @xmath27 } = { \\partial}{\\phi { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft } ( w { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright } ) } , \\quad   { \\bigl [ l_0 , { \\phi { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft } ( w { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright } ) } \\bigr ] } = h { \\phi { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft } ( w { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright } ) } + w { \\partial}{\\phi { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft } ( w { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright } ) } , \\quad   { \\bigl [ l_1 , { \\phi { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft } ( w { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright } ) } \\bigr ] } = 2h w { \\phi { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft } ( w { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright } ) } + w^2 { \\partial}{\\phi { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft } ( w { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright})}\\ ] ] and the invariance of @xmath21 then leads to the following differential equations for the two - point functions : @xmath28 it is a straight - forward exercise to show that the general solution of these equations has the form @xmath29 for some constant @xmath30 ( which could be zero )",

    "the reason is that each of the @xmath106 are in the same module for the extended algebra , hence each of these fock spaces gives exactly the same contribution to the fusion product .",

    "this necessitates a brief introduction to the famous fusion algorithm of nahm , gaberdiel and kausch @xcite .",
    "we compute a few fusion products explicitly before describing the results of more involved calculations that detail the structures of the indecomposable modules so constructed .",
    "we then use the results to derive a couple of logarithmic correlators , generalising the analysis of section  [ sec : logcorr ] , before briefly discussing other non - local percolation observables and other @xmath117 models .",
    "section  [ sec : trip ] introduces the first of our `` archetypal '' logarithmic conformal field theories , the symplectic fermions of kausch @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we discuss a family of @xmath119 theories which include symplectic fermions , the triplet model @xmath1 studied in @xcite , and the corresponding singlet model @xmath0 , itself a special case of zamolodchikov s original w - algebra @xcite .",
    "we begin with the symplectic fermion algebra , constructing its irreducible and indecomposable ( twisted ) representations and verifying the non - diagonalisability of @xmath14 on the latter , before decomposing its representations into those of the subalgebras @xmath1 and @xmath0 . for the singlet ,",
    "the spectrum is continuous and it is here that we derive character formulae and deduce modular transformations .",
    "the s - matrix is found to be symmetric and unitary , so we apply a continuous version of the verlinde formula and find that the resulting ( grothendieck ) fusion coefficients are positive integers .",
    "as far as we are aware , the modular properties of the singlet model s characters are new ( the generalisation to @xmath120 will be reported in @xcite ) . assuming that the continuous verlinde formula does give the correct ( grothendieck ) fusion coefficients , we also deduce many fusion rules , in particular concluding that the singlet model possesses a countable infinity of simple currents .",
    "we identify the maximal simple current extension as symplectic fermions and the maximal bosonic extension as the triplet model .",
    "this also seems to be new .",
    "we moreover use our singlet results to determine what the ( grothendieck ) fusion rules for the triplet model should be , finding agreement with the fusion computations of @xcite .",
    "this then provides a stringent consistency check of the continuous verlinde formula .",
    "we also conjecture the existence of certain singlet indecomposable modules before briefly discussing the known issue with obtaining an s - matrix for the triplet model ( the s - matrix entries are not constant ) and how this is manifested in the simple current extension formalism we have developed .",
    "finally , we discuss the bulk ( non - chiral ) aspects of these @xmath119 theories .",
    "bulk logarithmic conformal field theories are not as well understood as their chiral counterparts , though progress has been steady @xcite . for this , it has proven useful to study analogous situations in mathematics .",
    "for example , the representation of a semisimple finite - dimensional associative algebra , where it is acting on itself by left - multiplication , decomposes as a direct sum of irreducibles , with every irreducible appearing with multiplicity equal to its dimension ( wedderburn s theorem ) .",
    "however , the non - semisimple case gives a direct sum of projectives , where the multiplicity of each is now the dimension of the irreducible it covers .",
    "the semisimple case is also the result for compact lie groups @xmath121 acting on the hilbert space @xmath122 ( with @xmath123 the haar measure ) , whereas the non - semisimple case seems to be roughly correct for lie supergroups and many non - compact groups ( this is the _ minisuperspace limit _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this is relevant because the modular invariant partition functions that have been constructed for logarithmic conformal field theories often have the form @xmath124 } } } { { \\mathrm{ch}}\\bigl [ p_i \\bigr ] } = \\sum_i { \\overline{{{\\mathrm{ch}}\\bigl [ p_i \\bigr ] } } } { { \\mathrm{ch}}\\bigl [ l_i \\bigr]},\\ ] ] where @xmath125 labels the irreducibles @xmath126 in the spectrum and @xmath127 denotes an indecomposable cover of @xmath126 which one expects to be projective in some category .",
    "( in the rational case , each @xmath127 and @xmath126 coincide and this reduces to the standard diagonal invariant . ) because of this , the state space of a logarithmic theory seems likely to decompose , upon restricting to the chiral or antichiral algebra , into a direct sum of projectives ( each with infinite multiplicity ) .",
    "digressions over , we conclude our discussion of this family of @xmath119 logarithmic conformal field theories by noting the well known structure for the bulk state space of the symplectic fermions theory and discuss the structure one obtains by restricting to the triplet algebra @xcite .",
    "we then indicate how one could have guessed this structure , without _ a priori _ knowledge of the symplectic fermions structure , based on the form of the diagonal modular invariant partition function and the above analogy .",
    "this leads to a simple proposal for constructing bulk module structures from chiral ones which we stress automatically satisfies the physical _ locality _ requirement that bulk correlators are single - valued .",
    "algebraically , this will be met if the chiral and antichiral states have conformal dimensions that differ by an integer and , in a logarithmic theory , if the spin operator @xmath128 acts diagonalisably .",

    "section  [ sec : sl2 ] considers an example of a fractional level wess - zumino - witten model , specifically that whose symmetry algebra is @xmath3 at level @xmath130 .",
    "the existence of such fractional level theories was first suggested by kent @xcite in order to provide a unified coset construction of all virasoro minimal models , unitary and non - unitary .",
    "they began to be studied seriously once kac and wakimoto discovered @xcite that the levels required for kent s cosets , the _ admissible levels _ , were the only ones which admitted modules whose characters carried a finite - dimensional representation of the modular group @xmath81 . assuming , naturally enough , that this meant that admissible level models were rational , koh and sorba computed the fusion rules given by the verlinde formula , noting that this sometimes resulted in negative integer fusion coefficients @xcite .",
    "this puzzle was subsequently addressed by many groups @xcite , without any real progress , before gaberdiel pointed out @xcite that the assumption of rationality was in error ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "he constructed enough fusion products for @xmath3 at level @xmath131 to conclude that the theory was logarithmic , but was unable to solve the puzzle of negative fusion multiplicities .",
    "the level @xmath4 was subsequently argued to be logarithmic using a free field realisation @xcite , but a complete picture including indecomposable module structure , characters , modular properties and the verlinde formula has only recently emerged @xcite .",
    "the purpose of section  [ sec : sl2 ] is to explain this progress for @xmath4 .",
    "we start by introducing the closely related @xmath5 ghost system and derive the current algebra @xmath132 as an orbifold .",
    "instead of considering the representation theory of the ghost algebra , as we did for section  [ sec : trip ] , we determine the spectrum of @xmath132 directly . as",
    "before , we find a continuum of generically irreducible modules , but this time they are neither highest nor lowest weight . at the parameter values where the continuum modules become reducible , four highest weight modules are constructed ( these are the admissible modules of kac and wakimoto ) .",
    "the characters of these admissibles can be meromorphically continued using jacobi theta functions , leading to a four - dimensional representation of the modular group .",
    "we then illustrate the paradox of negative verlinde fusion coefficients before indicating its resolution @xcite using spectral flow automorphisms .",
    "a very important point here is that one must be careful with regions of convergence of characters . indeed , certain non - isomorphic modules , related by spectral flow , have ( up to a sign ) exactly the same meromorphically - continued character .",
    "however , the regions where these characters converge are disjoint , being separated by a common pole .",
    "we then interpret the sum of these characters as a distribution supported at this pole . with this formalism",
    ", we obtain modular properties , apply the verlinde formula and construct a discrete series of modular invariants . here , the story is very similar to the previous section and we are again able to propose a structure for the local bulk modules .",
    "finally , we use a free field realisation to compute correlation functions and conclude with a brief discussion of how all this generalises to the level @xmath131 .",
    "section  [ sec : gl11 ] addresses the last of the `` archetypal '' examples , the wess - zumino - witten theory on the lie supergroup @xmath6 . as usual , supergroup models depend upon a level @xmath53 and the symmetry algebra is an affine lie superalgebra .",
    "but , in contrast to ( integer level ) bosonic wess - zumino - witten models , our understanding of these superanalogues is still rather rudimentary . aside from the _ rational _ theories associated with @xmath12 , see @xcite for example , only the theories associated to the lie supergroups @xmath6 and @xmath133 ( which is just symplectic fermions ) are completely understood .",
    "indeed , these were the first logarithmic conformal field theories investigated over two decades ago .",
    "we structure this section so as to bring out the analogy with the previous two examples .",
    "we start with the algebra and representation theory , then continue with modular data and correlation functions following @xcite .",
    "this example , like the two that preceded it , exhibit all the features of the simplest known logarithmic conformal field theories .",
    "there are certainly many more logarithmic theories that should be considered , some with similar indecomposable structures to our examples , and some which are more complicated .",
    "we mention that there are many applications which involve supergroup theories of the latter class as , for example , in statistical physics @xcite and the ads / cft correspondence @xcite  these will therefore need a detailed investigation in the near future .",
    "section  [ sec : stag ] aims to briefly outline a reasonably general approach to understanding the mathematical structures that underlie logarithmic conformal field theory .",
    "it commences with a somewhat technical discussion which introduces the important idea of a _ staggered module _",
    ", familiar from virasoro studies @xcite , for a large class of associative algebras .",
    "some very basic results are proven at this level of generality ( these results have not before been published ) before restricting to a discussion of the _ logarithmic couplings _ that parametrise the isomorphism classes of staggered modules for the virasoro algebra .",
    "we emphasise that these numbers are as important to logarithmic conformal field theory as the three - point constants are to rational theories and we detail how they arise when computing two - point functions .",
    "we conclude with a brief analysis of an example of a virasoro indecomposable whose structure is more complicated than that of a staggered module because @xmath14 acts with a _",
    "rank @xmath134 jordan block_.    section  [ sec : conc ] then summarises what we have presented , describing a proposed approach to understanding quite general classes of logarithmic conformal field theories .",
    "finally , we provide a short appendix in which we have collected some of the necessary basic information about homological algebra , a very useful tool ( and language ) for describing the structure of indecomposable but reducible representations .",
    "percolation may be loosely defined as a collection of closely related probabilistic models whose observed behaviour is believed to be reasonably typical for more general classes of statistical theories . in particular , these models exhibit phase transitions as their defining parameters pass through certain critical values @xcite .",
    "moreover , percolation is particularly easy to simulate numerically , so it is a popular choice for testing predictions such as conformal invariance and universality @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we discuss how the hypothesis of conformal invariance , which led cardy to his celebrated formula @xcite for the horizontal crossing formula , can be accommodated within the standard framework of ( boundary ) conformal field theory .",
    "it has long been suspected ( see @xcite for example ) that the conformal invariance of percolation requires a logarithmic theory . here , we follow @xcite to deduce from the assumptions underlying cardy s derivation that the spectrum of percolation contains indecomposable modules on which the virasoro mode @xmath14 acts non - diagonalisably , hence that critical percolation is described by a logarithmic conformal field theory .      as with many other statistical models ,",
    "the primary consideration of percolation is the degree to which a very large number of identical objects tend to cluster together when distributed in a random fashion .",
    "the setup for one of the basic percolation models is as follows : consider a square lattice with a given edge length and choose a fixed rectangular subdomain whose sides are a union of lattice edges .",
    "a percolation configuration is then obtained by declaring that each edge within the subdomain is open with probability @xmath135 and closed with probability @xmath136 .",
    "the idea is that the subdomain represents a porous material and that open edges permit the flow of a liquid medium whereas closed edges do not . when @xmath137 , all edges are closed and the material is impermeable to the liquid .",
    "when @xmath138 , all edges are open and there is no obstruction to the liquid s flow . for @xmath139 , one",
    "is then led to question whether the liquid is able to percolate through the material and it is this , of course , that gives the model its name .    to be more precise",
    ", we may ask for the probability that a randomly chosen configuration of edges in our rectangular subdomain contains an open path connecting a chosen side of the rectangle with the opposite side .",
    "such a path is called a _ crossing _ and figure  [ fig : perc ] shows an example of a configuration in which one ( of the many ) crossings has been drawn .",
    "computing this crossing probability analytically is a hopeless task , though simulation can approximate it extremely well .",
    "however , one can ask the question again in the continuum limit where the edge length tends to @xmath113 while the size and shape of the rectangular subdomain is kept fixed . in this case",
    ", one has the result @xcite that the limit of the crossing probabilities is @xmath113 if @xmath135 is less than a critical value , which turns out to be @xmath140 for a square lattice , and is @xmath8 if @xmath135 is greater than @xmath141 .",
    "the only interesting value is then the limit of the crossing probabilities when @xmath135 is precisely this critical value .",
    "was not known until cardy s crossing formula ( see ) was rigorously proven @xcite . ]    a typical percolation configuration ( left ) for a rectangular subdomain of a square lattice showing only the open edges ( closed edges are omitted ) .",

    "this lattice has several crossings from left to right , one of which is indicated in bold ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]    this probability of a crossing being present when @xmath142 was famously derived by cardy @xcite within the formalism of boundary conformal field theory and his result is generally recognised as one of the most striking confirmations of the conjecture that the continuum limit of a statistical model is conformally invariant at its critical points .",
    "cardy combined the well known description of percolation as the @xmath143 limit of the @xmath144-state potts model with an inspired identification of certain boundary - changing operators in these potts models to write the crossing probability as the four - point correlation function of a virasoro primary field @xmath145 , where the subscript indicates the field s kac labels .",
    "to apply the machinery of conformal field theory , one now maps the rectangular subdomain conformally onto ( a compactification of ) the upper half - plane so that the fields insertion points ( the corners of the rectangle ) are mapped to points @xmath146 , @xmath147 , lying on the real axis ( or to @xmath148 ) .    the central charge @xmath19 of the continuum limit of the @xmath144-state potts model is well known @xcite , assuming of course that the limit is conformally invariant . for percolation ( @xmath143 ) , one obtains @xmath117 and it therefore follows that @xmath145 has conformal dimension @xmath113 .",
    "moreover , @xmath145 will have a singular descendant field at grade @xmath112 and so , according to standard conformal field theory dogma , the four - point correlator representing the crossing probability will satisfy a second - order linear differential equation .",
    "the obvious behaviour of the crossing probability as the aspect ratio of the rectangle tends to @xmath113 and @xmath148 then picks out a unique solution : @xmath149 the agreement between this computation and numerical data from simulations @xcite is impressive .",
    "the precise formula for the crossing probability is not important for what follows .",
    "rather , what we wish to emphasise is that the derivation is performed with the aid of a limit @xmath143 which hides a remarkable amount of subtlety .",
    "indeed , one might guess that the percolation conformal field theory is a minimal model , based on the usual identification of the @xmath144-state potts models for @xmath150 and @xmath134 with @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively .",
    "however , the minimal model with @xmath117 is @xmath118 which is trivial in the sense that its field content is limited to constant multiples of the identity .",
    "obviously , four - point functions in @xmath118 will be constant , so this model can not accommodate cardy s derivation . on the other hand , it would be distressing if cardy s derivation turned out to be inconsistent with the principles of conformal field theory .",
    "we will therefore assume that a description of critical percolation can be accommodated within conformal field theory .",
    "as we shall see , this will require the consideration of reducible , yet indecomposable , representations .      before embarking on our explorations ,",
    "let us pause to recall some useful facts concerning virasoro modules .",
    "this will also serve to introduce our notation .",
    "verma modules will be denoted by @xmath153 , where @xmath26 is the conformal dimensional of the highest weight state , and their irreducible quotients by @xmath154 . for @xmath117",
    ", we recall that the verma module is itself irreducible unless @xmath155 for some @xmath156 , where @xmath157 in the latter case , @xmath158 will have a submodule generated by a singular vector at grade @xmath159 ( its conformal dimension will be @xmath160 ) . if @xmath95 is",
    "even or @xmath161 is a multiple of @xmath134 , then the maximal proper submodule of @xmath162 is generated by the singular vector of lowest ( positive ) grade .",
    "otherwise , it is generated by the two singular vectors of lowest and next - to - lowest grades .",
    "it is convenient to collate the @xmath163 with @xmath156 into an _ extended kac table _ , a part of which we reproduce in table  [ tab : kac ] .",
    "finally , we introduce notation for certain verma module quotients that will frequently arise in what follows : @xmath164 .     & & & & & & & & & & + 2 & 1 & & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 2 & & 5 & + & & & & & & & & & & + & & & & & & & & & &    we begin by postulating that the conformal field theory describing the continuum limit of critical percolation contains a vacuum @xmath21 .",
    "equivalently , by the state - field correspondence , the identity field @xmath165 is present in the theory . as @xmath166 ,",
    "the vacuum verma module @xmath167 has singular vectors at grades @xmath8 and @xmath112 and these turn out to be independent in the sense that the latter is not descended from the former . which are each descended from both the grade @xmath8 and grade @xmath112 singular vectors .",
    "] in fact , the maximal proper submodule of @xmath167 is generated by these two singular vectors . since @xmath168 corresponds to the field @xmath169 , we have to set @xmath170 ( by quotienting @xmath167 by the submodule it generates ) .",
    "however , the grade @xmath112 singular vector then corresponds to the energy - momentum tensor @xmath171 .",
    "if this is set to @xmath113 , then each of its modes , the virasoro generators @xmath15 , must all act as the zero operator on the states of the theory , and this leads us to the ( trivial ) minimal model @xmath118 ( or a direct sum of copies of this model ) .    to get a non - trivial @xmath117 theory",
    ", we must abandon the idea that singular vectors are always set to @xmath113 . instead of assuming that the vacuum @xmath21 generates the irreducible virasoro module @xmath172 , we are led to propose that the vacuum module is the reducible , but indecomposable , quotient @xmath173 .",
    "this is , in fact , the only remaining option because the only singular vector to survive in @xmath174 has grade @xmath112 ( it corresponds to @xmath175 ) and setting it to @xmath113 leads back to the irreducible vacuum module @xmath172 . in the language of appendix  [ app :",
    "exact ] , our proposed vacuum module @xmath174 is an extension of @xmath172 by the submodule generated by @xmath176 , which is itself irreducible and isomorphic to @xmath177 .",
    "this is summarised by the exact sequence ( see appendix  [ app : exact ] ) @xmath178    this argument shows that there is a unique choice for the vacuum module which leads to a non - trivial theory .",
    "moreover , this choice is reducible , but indecomposable . to accommodate cardy s derivation",
    ", there should also exist in the theory a primary field @xmath145 with a vanishing grade @xmath112 descendant .",
    "this last requirement stems from the fact that the crossing probability is derived as a solution to a second order differential equation and this equation is derived from the vanishing of a grade @xmath112 descendant . because @xmath179 , the corresponding verma module is again @xmath167 with singular vectors at grades @xmath8 and @xmath112 .",
    "this time , we can not set the grade @xmath8 singular vector to @xmath113 because it would lead to a first order differential equation for cardy s crossing probability ( one can check that the solutions to this equation are all constant ) . we therefore conclude that the reducible , but indecomposable , module @xmath180 is present .",
    "again , this is the only possibility compatible with cardy s derivation ; the exact sequence is @xmath181    this concludes the basic setup for a conformal field theory which is consistent with cardy s derivation of the crossing formula .",
    "one can therefore declare with confidence that the percolation ( boundary ) conformal field theory , whatever it may be , must include the indecomposable vacuum module @xmath174 and the indecomposable module @xmath182 in appropriate boundary sectors .",
    "it remains to explore the consequences of this conclusion . as usual ,",
    "one can try to generate new field content through fusion .",
    "it is natural to expect that the identity field @xmath165 will act as the fusion identity ( @xmath183 and @xmath184 ) and this is indeed the case .",
    "one also expects that the vanishing of the grade @xmath112 singular descendant of @xmath145 will imply that @xmath185 where @xmath186 is a virasoro primary field of conformal dimension @xmath187 .",
    "this also turns out to be true .",
    "however , the natural sequel to this computation , @xmath188 where @xmath189 is primary of dimension @xmath190 , is _ false _ as we shall see .      in standard conformal field theory , where the modules are completely reducible ,",
    "it is permissible to regard fusion as an operation on primary fields , remembering that the fusion rules in fact also apply to the entire family of fields descended from the respective primaries .",
    "however , we have already surmised that there are reducible , but indecomposable , modules in the percolation spectrum .",
    "therefore , one needs to be much more precise about fusion and regard it not as an operation on primaries , but rather as an operation on the modules themselves .",
    "we also need to be more careful about how fusion rules are computed .",
    "the usual method of examining the effect of setting singular vectors to zero on three - point functions might not be practical if we do not know what type of fields to insert in the three - point functions ( as we shall see , primary fields do not suffice in general ) .",
    "the standard method of computing fusion rules when reducible , but indecomposable , modules are involved is known as the _ nahm - gaberdiel - kausch _ algorithm .",
    "this was originally introduced by nahm @xcite in a limited setting and was extended ( and applied to indecomposable virasoro modules at @xmath119 ) by gaberdiel and kausch @xcite .",
    "the key insight behind this algorithm is the realisation that one can concretely realise the fusion product of two modules @xmath191 and @xmath192 as a quotient of the vector space tensor product @xmath193 . to demonstrate this",
    ", one needs to know how the action of the symmetry algebra ( here , the virasoro algebra ) on @xmath194 is derived from the actions on @xmath191 and on @xmath192 .",
    "this takes the form of coproduct formulae @xcite :    [ eq : ngk ] @xmath195    actually , one derives two distinct coproducts which should coincide  is then deduced by imposing this equality .",
    "of course , there are generalisations of these formulae for other symmetry algebras @xcite .",
    "practically , one does not compute explicitly with the entire fusion module @xmath194 .",
    "rather , one restricts attention to a subspace by setting all states of sufficiently high grade to @xmath113 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath196 is the cutoff grade , then any state which can be written as a linear combination of states of the form @xmath197 , with @xmath198 , is set to @xmath113",

    "we remark that more general percolation crossing probabilities are considered in @xcite from a different perspective .    from a more abstract point of view",

    "an old proposal of gurarie and ludwig @xcite associates this latter conformal field theory with modules from the first column of the extended kac table .",
    "we will not detail this polymer theory or its observables here , instead mentioning only that a field corresponding to the module @xmath310 is relevant and that fusing this module with itself leads to an indecomposable module which we denote by @xmath311 : @xmath312 the loewy diagram of @xmath311 is identical to that of @xmath256 ( illustrated in figure  [ fig : percloewy ] ) except that the composition factor @xmath255 is replaced by @xmath254 .",

    "this confirms experimentally that percolation corresponds to first row modules and dilute polymers to first column modules , at least in their formulation as boundary conformal field theories .",
    "one thing worth mentioning here is the observation ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "a ) ) that the otherwise reasonable - looking two - point function @xmath318 is inconsistent with conformal invariance .",
    "more precisely , the three inhomogeneous partial differential equations for this correlator , which are derived from the global conformal invariance of the vacuum , admit no simultaneous solution",
    ". this appears @xcite to rule out the possibility that both @xmath256 and @xmath311 can belong to the spectrum .",
    "however , a more careful conclusion @xcite is that the presence of one of these indecomposables in a boundary sector labelled by boundary conditions @xmath319 and @xmath320 precludes the presence of the other in any boundary sector with label @xmath319 or @xmath320 . this does not prove that @xmath256 and @xmath311 can coexist in a boundary conformal field theory , but it does provide a loophole whereby inconsistent two - point functions may be avoided .",

    "we remark that these notions of being `` standard '' may be lifted to the respective simple current extensions by declaring that an extended module is standard whenever it is the orbit , under fusing with the simple current , of a standard module . in this sense ,",
    "@xmath388 and @xmath389 are standard @xmath1-modules , while @xmath362 and @xmath363 are not .",
    "note that this notion is more general than logarithmic conformal field theory .",
    "for example , we may choose the standard modules of a ( type i ) lie superalgebra like @xmath796 to be its kac modules @xcite .",
    "similarly , a good choice for quantum groups like @xmath920 is that standard means highest weight .",
    "even the diagram algebras , such as the temperley - lieb algebra , which crop up in statistical lattice models have standard modules , in this case the right choices are the cell modules of graham and lehrer @xcite ( also known as standard modules ; we have borrowed the nomenclature from this example ) .    the feature that these collections have in common is that standard modules are always indecomposable and , moreover , are naturally parametrised so that they are generically irreducible . in this review ,",
    "we have referred to irreducible standard modules as typical and reducible ones as atypical . furthermore , and this is crucial for the next definition , the central elements of the associative algebra all act diagonalisably on standard modules .",
    "we now define a staggered module @xmath921 to be one which is ( isomorphic to ) an extension of a standard module by another upon which there is a central element @xmath144 acting non - diagonalisably : @xmath922 in other words , @xmath921 has a submodule isomorphic to a standard module @xmath923 , which we shall refer to as the _ left module _ , and",

    "in other words , any @xmath938 annihilating @xmath935 also annihilates @xmath944 .",
    "this is a bit abstract , so let us consider an important specialisation that occurs for a lie ( super)algebra with standard meaning highest weight and @xmath237 chosen to project onto the highest weight state of @xmath925 .",

    "another example occurs in the symplectic fermions theory in which one can identify @xmath119 staggered virasoro modules where @xmath235 and @xmath237 have dimensions @xmath113 and @xmath8 , respectively . for each such module , one example being @xmath1050 and @xmath1051 ( see section  [ sec : sf ] for notation )",
    ", @xmath551 is found to be @xmath525 .",
    "however , there is another @xmath119 theory , the _ abelian sandpile model _ ( see @xcite for example ) ,",
    "in which a staggered module with @xmath235 dimension @xmath113 and @xmath237 dimension @xmath8 is present .",
    "however , the logarithmic coupling here has been measured to be @xmath1052 @xcite , indicating that this theory is not equivalent to symplectic fermions .",
    "as noted at the beginning , the staggered modules which have occupied us throughout this section are among the simplest , structurally , which give rise to logarithmic singularities in two - point functions .",
    "however , more complicated structures may arise : examples of indecomposable virasoro modules on which @xmath14 acts with jordan blocks of rank @xmath134 were first discovered in @xcite through fusion .",
    "these appear structurally as a glueing of four highest weight modules and their existence was posited more generally in @xcite using a ( conjectured ) means of analysing virasoro representations using lattice techniques .",
    "moreover , indecomposables formed by glueing three highest weight modules , but with only rank @xmath112 jordan blocks , have been shown to arise in the percolation conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "more recent lattice computations @xcite suggest that indecomposables with jordan blocks of arbitrary rank are physically relevant .",
    "unfortunately , there is almost nothing known about the finer mathematical structure of these more complicated indecomposables .    for completeness , we consider an example illustrating a virasoro indecomposable with a rank @xmath134 jordan block for @xmath14 .",
    "it may be realised as the fusion product of the @xmath117 irreducibles @xmath1053 and @xmath1054 , but has only been explicitly constructed to grade @xmath250 @xcite , so its deeper structure remains unknown ( see @xcite for a conjectured character ) .",
    "there are two ground states of dimension @xmath113 and they form a jordan block for @xmath14 .",
    "we denote the eigenvector by @xmath235 and its partner by @xmath237 , normalised so that @xmath1055 . at dimension @xmath8 , one finds four states with all but one forming a rank @xmath134 jordan block .",
    "@xmath245 is found to be non - zero , hence is the @xmath14-eigenstate belonging to the jordan block ; the other eigenstate will be denoted by @xmath1056 .",
    "the generator of the jordan block will be denoted by @xmath1057 and , along with @xmath1058 , this completes a basis for the dimension @xmath8 subspace .",
    "the states @xmath1057 and @xmath1056 must satisfy the following relations : @xmath1059 however , @xmath1060 as @xmath1057 generates a rank @xmath134 block , hence we may scale @xmath1057 so that @xmath1061 .",
    "moreover , @xmath1056 is an @xmath14-eigenvector , hence @xmath1062 , giving @xmath1063 .",
    "one can check explicitly that @xmath1064 is non - zero , hence we may normalise @xmath1056 so that @xmath1065 .",
    "we now make use of the freedom we have in defining @xmath1057 : shifting by multiples of @xmath1058 and @xmath1056 allows us to tune @xmath1066 and @xmath1067 to @xmath113 .",
    "finally , @xmath1068 reduces us to a single unknown : @xmath1069 these conclusions may be checked explicitly with the result that the fusion product has @xmath1070 .",
    "it is now straight - forward to calculate the corresponding two - point correlators : @xmath1071 the constants @xmath30 , @xmath44 , @xmath17 , @xmath1072 and @xmath797 all depend upon the precise choices that we have made for the fields , while @xmath1073 does not .",
    "we remark that a @xmath1074 term in two - point functions is indicative of a rank @xmath134 jordan block for @xmath14 .",
    "we conclude by noting that there are large gaps in our knowledge regarding how one can completely specify the isomorphism class of staggered modules for general chiral algebras and for generalised staggered modules such as the one studied above .",
    "while the `` generalised logarithmic coupling '' @xmath1073 seems to characterise the module above , we can not say whether each choice of @xmath1073 corresponds to a consistent indecomposable structure or whether @xmath1070 is the only consistent choice .",
    "a related issue is our lack of knowledge concerning logarithmic couplings for bulk modules .",
    "we have throughout specified loewy diagrams for atypical bulk indecomposables without considering whether these diagrams completely determine the module structure .",
    "this seems to be a very difficult problem which has only received attention very recently @xcite .",
    "hopefully , the years to come will improve our understanding of bulk atypicals considerably .",
    "in this review , we have covered various aspects of logarithmic conformal field theory . with the exception of motivational sections like section  [ sec : crossing ]",
    ", we have worked exclusively in the continuum setting .",
    "the indecomposable structures that arise in logarithmic theories were introduced for the virasoro algebra through a discussion of the horizontal crossing probability for critical percolation . while these structures lead directly to the type of singularities in correlation functions that logarithmic theories are named for , the percolation theory is still not particularly well understood . in particular , we are still not sure of its spectrum . to contrast this",
    ", we then embarked on detailed summaries of three of the best understood examples ( we refer to them as `` archetypes '' ) of logarithmic conformal field theories . here",
    ", the indecomposability arose for modules over certain affine kac - moody superalgebras and we were able to provide a relatively complete picture including the spectrum and fusion rules , the chiral characters and their modular transformations , as well as bulk modular invariants and structures for the bulk state space .",
    "we concluded with a brief introduction to the general ( and as yet unknown ) mathematical theory of the type of indecomposables responsible for logarithmic structure , the staggered modules .",
    "the continuum approach to logarithmic conformal field theory that we advocate here consists of two essential steps .",
    "first , one needs to thoroughly understand the representation theory of the chiral algebra .",
    "the observed pattern in each of our archetypes is that one has a large spectrum , preferably continuous , of standard modules which are generically irreducible .",
    "the irreducible standard modules are said to be typical , whereas there are also atypical standard modules that are reducible , but indecomposable , the vacuum module being a notable example .",
    "the crucial , but difficult in general , step is to understand the structure of the projective covers ( in an appropriate category of vertex algebra modules ) of these atypicals . we expect that there is a generalisation of bernten - gelfand - gelfand reciprocity @xcite at work here , where the structure of the atypical standards in terms of irreducibles is related to the structure of the projectives in terms of atypical standards .",
    "the second step is the modular data . here",
    ", we have seen that the characters of the standard modules span a ( projective ) representation of the modular group and that , when the spectrum is continuous , this representation may be ( topologically ) completed so as to include the characters of the atypical irreducibles .",
    "then , we can apply the continuum verlinde formula to get grothendieck fusion coefficients , determine the bulk modular invariants , and discuss extended algebras .",
    "these steps together constitute a procedure which is just a logarithmic adaptation of that detailed in section  [ sec : freeboson ] for the free boson .",
    "we also view it as a wide - reaching generalisation of the formalism proposed for type i supergroup wess - zumino - witten models in @xcite .",
    "while it has thus far only been tested on logarithmic theories related to affine algebras , we are convinced that our procedure is much more generally applicable .",
    "we therefore summarise it as follows :    1 .",
    "start with a theory possessing a continuous spectrum of well understood standard modules whose characters are all linearly independent .",
    "2 .   compute the modular s - transforms of the characters of the standards , the typical irreducibles being a proper subset .",
    "3 .   splice short exact sequences to obtain resolutions for the atypical irreducibles in terms of standards .",
    "this allows one to express atypical characters as infinite sums of standard characters .",
    "4 .   use these sums to deduce the s - matrix entries between atypical irreducibles and standards .",
    "apply the natural continuum version of the verlinde formula to compute the grothendieck fusion rules , checking that the resulting multiplicities are non - negative integers .",
    "check the modular invariance of the diagonal bulk partition function and look for simple currents in the fusion rules .",
    "construct extended algebras with discrete spectra and modular invariant partition functions .",
    "use the grothendieck fusion rules of the continuum theory to deduce those of its simple current extensions .",
    "we remark that the determination of the genuine fusion rules and the structure of the projective covers of the atypicals still remains . for this",
    ", the nahm - gaberdiel - kausch fusion algorithm will be computationally prohibitive in all but the easiest cases .",
    "however , the grothendieck rules indicate exactly where one should look for indecomposable structure , especially if one has mathematical knowledge of the irreducibles in the spectrum ( extension groups in particular ) .",
    "we therefore suggest that combining this knowledge with the computation of carefully chosen correlators may be sufficient to determine the structures of the indecomposables that arise by fusing irreducibles . in this article",
    ", we have only partially capitalised upon the power of free field realisations .",
    "all three archetypes admitted a free field realisation inside a lattice theory , the chiral algebra being identified with the kernel of a screening charge .",
    "such a description can be a powerful tool in representation - theoretic investigations and provide one of the only really general tools available for computing the correlators required to completely determine the fusion rules .",
    "it is worth stressing that the derivation of atypical s - matrix elements , necessary for applying the verlinde formula , requires _",
    "non - periodic _ resolutions of atypical irreducibles in terms of indecomposable standards .",
    "the simple current extensions that we construct usually have discrete , or even finite , spectra and so the resolutions for the extended atypicals are periodic . in many such examples ,",
    "the s - transformations are known @xcite to depend upon the modular parameter @xmath371 , invalidating a straight - forward application of the verlinde formula .",
    "there is a proposal @xcite for a generalisation of the verlinde formula appropriate to certain logarithmic theories with discrete spectra ( see also @xcite ) , so it would be very interesting to see if this proposal can be derived using our extended algebra formalism .",
    "( of course , the fusion rules for an extended algebra are easily obtained from those of its parent . )",
    "finally , we remark that there is a real need to extend our detailed knowledge of logarithmic conformal field theory to more non - trivial examples .",
    "the three archetypes considered in this review all have similar logarithmic structures and are , in fact , very closely related .",
    "namely , one can construct @xmath132 as a @xmath1075-coset of ( an extension of ) @xmath795 @xcite , while the singlet algebra @xmath0 and triplet algebra @xmath1 are @xmath1075-cosets of @xmath132 and its maximal extended algebra , respectively @xcite . , @xmath1076 and @xmath778 @xcite , but the generalisation is that @xmath120 and @xmath129 are @xmath1075-cosets of certain fractional level feigin - semikhatov algebras @xmath10 @xcite . ] in particular , all the atypical irreducibles of these theories may be resolved in terms of ( indecomposable ) standards .",
    "the next step in terms of difficulty would be to consider logarithmic theories in which one has _",
    "degree @xmath112 _ atypicals which are resolved in terms of degree @xmath8 atypicals , which are themselves resolved in terms of standards .",
    "an example of such a theory has been worked out in @xcite .",
    "we expect that the @xmath1077 and @xmath1078 wess - zumino - witten models will provide further examples which , with applications to both string theory and statistical physics in mind , seem to us to be the most obvious candidates for future study .",
    "we would like to thank the many many people who have contributed to the writing of this logarithmic review through teaching us , discussing with us and telling us when we were talking rubbish .",
    "these people include , but are not limited to , drazen adamovi , john cardy , matthias gaberdiel , azat gainutdinov , yasuaki hikida , kalle kytl , andrew linshaw , pierre mathieu , antun milas , paul pearce , thomas quella , jrgen rasmussen , peter rnne , philippe ruelle , ingo runkel , yvan saint - aubin , hubert saleur , volker schomerus , alyosha semikhatov , romain vasseur and simon wood .",
    "the research of dr is supported by an australian research council discovery project dp1093910 .",
    "the quantum state space of a ( bulk ) conformal field theory is a module ( representation space ) over a symmetry algebra which must contain two commuting copies of the virasoro algebra ( one copy in the boundary case ) .",
    "raison dtre _ of logarithmic conformal field theory is that there are occasions for which this module can not be written as a direct sum of irreducible submodules over the symmetry algebra , but rather that one must include , in the direct sum , some submodules which are reducible but indecomposable .",
    "when discussing reducible but indecomposable modules , the language of homological algebra and category theory becomes very convenient , indeed almost unavoidable . in this appendix",
    ", we will introduce some of the basic concepts and terminology that are used freely throughout the text .",
    "first , recall that a module is said to be",
    "_ reducible _ if it contains a non - trivial proper submodule and _ decomposable _ if it may be written as the direct sum of two non - trivial submodules : @xmath1079 with @xmath1080 .",
    "we remark that in the latter case , @xmath1081 and @xmath1082 are called _ direct summands _ of the decomposable module @xmath191 .",
    "an _ irreducible _ ( or _ simple _ ) module is then one which has only the trivial module and itself as submodules . a direct sum of irreducible modules",
    "is said to be _ completely reducible _ ( or _ semisimple _ ) .",
    "similarly , an _ indecomposable _ module is one for which @xmath1079 implies that either @xmath1081 or @xmath1082 is trivial . finally , we define a _ proper _ submodule of @xmath191 to be one which is not all of @xmath191 .",
    "a _ maximal _ proper submodule of @xmath191 is then a proper submodule @xmath192 for which @xmath1083 ( with @xmath202 also a submodule of @xmath191 ) implies that @xmath1084 .    the structure - preserving maps between modules @xmath191 and @xmath192 , the _ module homomorphisms _ ( or intertwiners ) , are defined to be those linear maps @xmath1085 which commute with the action of the symmetry algebra @xmath30 : @xmath1086 canonical examples include the identity map @xmath1087 , the inclusion map @xmath1088 of a submodule @xmath191 of @xmath192 , and the canonical projection @xmath1089 onto the quotient by a submodule .",
    "we note that both the kernel and image of a module homomorphism @xmath1085 are submodules ( of @xmath191 and @xmath192 , respectively ) .",
    "one of the central notions of homological algebra is the _",
    "exact sequence_. this is a chain of modules connected by module homomorphisms , @xmath1090 which is _ exact _ : at each position @xmath342 of the chain , the kernel of the outgoing homomorphism @xmath1091 coincides with the image of the incoming one @xmath1092 , that is , @xmath1093 .",
    "one may also consider chains which terminate at either end , in which case one does not require exactness at the endpoints . as examples ,",
    "note that the identity , inclusion and quotient maps give rise to the following exact sequences : @xmath1094 conversely , the first sequence says that @xmath1095 is bijective , the second that @xmath1096 is injective and the third that @xmath957 is surjective .",
    "we remark that it is standard to abbreviate the trivial module @xmath1097 to just @xmath113 .",
    "a _ short exact sequence _ is an exact sequence of the form @xmath1098 ( note that @xmath1096 is automatically an injection and @xmath957 is automatically a surjection ) .",
    "this concisely summarises the common situation in which @xmath191 is a submodule @xmath192 and the quotient @xmath1099 is isomorphic to @xmath144 .",
    "an obvious question that arises now is whether there is a submodule of @xmath192 isomorphic to @xmath144 such that @xmath1100  if so , then we say that the short exact sequence _",
    "splits_. certainly , if @xmath192 is such a direct sum , then the sequence is exact .",
    "we are therefore asking if a direct sum is the only possibility . in the very important case",
    "in which both @xmath191 and @xmath144 are indecomposable , this amounts to asking if @xmath191 and @xmath144 can be `` glued together '' to form a new indecomposable @xmath192 , or whether they may only be combined as @xmath1101 .    answering",
    "this question is a very subtle and difficult business in general .",
    "the general machinery of homological algebra reduces this to the computation of the first _ extension group _ @xmath1102 ( when is exact , @xmath192 is said to be an _ extension _ of @xmath144 by @xmath191 ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath1103 guarantees that always splits , hence that @xmath1100 is the only possibility",
    ". we will not need to concern ourselves with the formal machinery required to compute extension groups in general .",
    "instead , we only remark that there is one easy test for deciding when a short exact sequence must split : if some _ central _ element of the symmetry algebra @xmath30 acts as a multiple of the identity on @xmath191 and as a _",
    "different _ multiple of the identity on @xmath144 , then it acts on @xmath192 as a linear map with two distinct eigenspaces which may easily be checked to be submodules isomorphic to @xmath191 and @xmath144 . in other words",
    ", it follows that @xmath192 splits as @xmath1101",
    ".    we will typically apply this test on modules that are graded by the ( generalised ) eigenvalues of a zero - mode such as that of the virasoro algebra @xmath14 . in this case , the central element should be identified with @xmath926 and the test reduces to the remark that if the states of the indecomposable modules @xmath1081 and @xmath1082 , have conformal dimensions ( @xmath14-eigenvalues ) in @xmath1104 and @xmath1105 , respectively , then @xmath1106 will follow if @xmath1107 .",
    "we also note that there may exist modules @xmath144 for which @xmath1103 for all modules @xmath191 ( in the category under consideration ) .",
    "such @xmath144 are said to be _",
    "projective_. these modules give a rough measure of maximal complexity among indecomposable modules .",
    "more precisely , they have the property that if they appear as a quotient of any module , then that module decomposes as the direct sum of @xmath144 and something else .",
    "we mention that if an irreducible module @xmath144 is a quotient of an indecomposable projective module @xmath1108 , then we say that @xmath1108 is the _ projective cover _ of @xmath144 ( projectivity guarantees that these covers are unique when they exist ) .",
    "this is a remarkably useful concept .",
    "unfortunately , progress in rigorously identifying projective covers for the module categories of interest in logarithmic conformal field theory is lamentably slow .",
    "one construction that we will take advantage of is that of _ splicing _ two short exact sequences together .",
    "this procedure starts from two short exact sequences of the forms @xmath1109 and produces the sequence @xmath1110 it is a simple exercise to check that the resulting sequence is also exact .",
    "moreover , if one has a short exact sequence with @xmath1082 in the third position , @xmath1111 say , then the splicing process may be repeated to obtain a new , longer exact sequence .",
    "the most interesting case occurs when one can splice infinitely many times , thereby obtaining a long exact sequence called a _ resolution _ of @xmath1112 in terms of the @xmath1113 : @xmath1114 when the @xmath1113 belong to a class of well - behaved modules , one can use this to understand the behaviour of @xmath1112 .",
    "one point that deserves emphasising is that the indecomposable structures that modules may exhibit become irrelevant when modules are replaced by their underlying vector spaces .",
    "this is because exact sequences of vector spaces always split .",
    "it follows that quantities attached to modules which only depend upon their vector space structure , characters being prime examples , will be blind to any indecomposable structure .",
    "one is therefore motivated to consider the effect of forgetting the indecomposable structure of modules such as the quantum state space .",
    "certainly , it will usually be easier to ignore questions of whether a module is completely reducible or not and for some applications , computing modular invariant partition functions for example , maintaining such ignorance is perfectly justified .",
    "this `` forgetting '' may be formalised through the notion of a _ grothendieck group_. here , one starts with a collection ( category ) of modules , preferably finitely - generated , and forms an abelian group @xmath1115 whose generators are formal elements @xmath1116}$ ] , where @xmath191 is a module from the collection , and whose relations are @xmath1117 } - { \\bigl [ n \\bigr ] } + { \\bigl [ q \\bigr ] } = 0 , \\qquad \\text{whenever } \\quad { 0 { \\longrightarrow}m \\overset{}{{\\longrightarrow } } n \\overset{}{{\\longrightarrow } } q { \\longrightarrow}0 } \\quad \\text{is exact.}\\ ] ] the point of these relations is to ensure that all extensions of @xmath144 by @xmath191 are identified with @xmath1101 in @xmath1115 . in favourable circumstances , such as when the characters of the irreducible modules are linearly independent , then the abelian group generated by the characters will be isomorphic to the grothendieck group .",
    "note that the collections of modules that we will be considering will always carry a tensor product structure ( fusion ) and that this structure will ( almost ) always induce a well - defined product on @xmath1115 .",
    "we will therefore usually refer to @xmath1115 as a _ grothendieck ring _ or grothendieck fusion ring .",
    "finally , it is often convenient to go beyond the formalism of exact sequences in order to visualise the structure of an indecomposable module .",
    "one way to do this is through _ composition series_. this is a filtration of a module @xmath191 by submodules , @xmath1118 such that the _ subquotients _ @xmath1119 of @xmath191 are all irreducible .",
    "composition series are not unique , but if @xmath191 does possess a composition series , then the _ length _ @xmath995 and the _ composition factors _",
    "@xmath1120 are common to every composition series of @xmath191 ( only the ordering of the @xmath1120 may change ) .",
    "a common variation on this theme is the _",
    "socle series_. here , one again has a filtration by modules , but the condition that @xmath1121 be irreducible is replaced by the requirement that @xmath1121 be the _ socle _ of @xmath1122 .",
    "the socle of a module @xmath191 is defined to be its maximal completely reducible submodule .",
    "equivalently , it is the ( direct ) sum of the irreducible submodules of @xmath191 . as the socle is unique",
    "( if it exists ) , the same is true of socle series .",
    "in essence , composition series describe how irreducible modules are glued together to form @xmath191 , whereas socle series describe how completely reducible modules are glued and so are usually more efficient .",
    "the dual notion to the socle is the maximal semisimple quotient , sometimes called the _",
    "head_.    we conclude with an abstract example illustrating an indecomposable structure which commonly arises in logarithmic conformal field theory ( and elsewhere ) .",
    "the socle series is @xmath1123 where the @xmath1120 are the irreducible subquotients ( composition factors ) of @xmath191 . a common way of visualising this information is through the associated _",
    "loewy diagram_. this is constructed by `` layering '' with the @xmath125-th layer consisting of the direct summands comprising the @xmath125-th filtration quotient @xmath1121 . in the example at hand ,",
    "the bottom layer is @xmath1124 , the middle layer is @xmath1125 , and the top layer is @xmath1126 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : loewy ] ( left ) .",

    ", both @xmath1131 and @xmath1132 may be associated to certain states of @xmath191 and the arrow indicates that the action of the algebra can take a state associated with @xmath1131 to a state associated with @xmath1132 , but not vice - versa .",
    "more precisely , it is possible to isolate @xmath1131 and @xmath1132 by canonically constructing a length @xmath112 subquotient of @xmath191 whose composition factors are precisely @xmath1131 and @xmath1132 .",

    "we will not try to demonstrate or verify this precise criterion for drawing arrows on loewy diagrams here . suffice to say that it will be clear in the examples considered how composition factors are associated to states and arrows will be drawn on this rough basis .",

    "<S> each of the archetypal logarithmic conformal field theories is studied here by first determining its irreducible spectrum , which turns out to be continuous , as well as a selection of natural reducible , but indecomposable , modules . </S>",
    "<S> this is followed by a detailed description of how to obtain character formulae for each irreducible , a derivation of the action of the modular group on the characters , and an application of the verlinde formula to compute the grothendieck fusion rules . in each case , the ( genuine ) fusion rules are known , so comparisons can be made and favourable conclusions drawn . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , each example admits an infinite set of simple currents , hence extended symmetry algebras may be constructed and a series of bulk modular invariants computed . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of such an extended theory is typically discrete and this is how the triplet model @xmath1 arises , for example . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , simple current technology admits a derivation of the extended algebra fusion rules from those of its continuous parent theory . </S>",
    "<S> finally , each example is concluded by a brief description of the computation of some bulk correlators , a discussion of the structure of the bulk state space , and remarks concerning more advanced developments and generalisations .    </S>",
    "<S> the final part gives a very short account of the theory of staggered modules , the ( simplest class of ) representations that are responsible for the logarithmic singularities that distinguish logarithmic theories from their rational cousins . </S>",
    "<S> these modules are discussed in a generality suitable to encompass all the examples met in this review and some of the very basic structure theory is proven . </S>",
    "<S> then , the important quantities known as logarithmic couplings are reviewed for virasoro staggered modules and their role as fundamentally important parameters , akin to the three - point constants of rational conformal field theory , is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> an appendix is also provided in order to introduce some of the necessary , but perhaps unfamiliar , language of homological algebra .    </S>",
