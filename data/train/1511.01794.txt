    "protocol television ( iptv ) services have been becoming increasingly popular among telecommunication companies @xcite . recently , due to the significant growth in the amount of mobile devices , access bandwidth over wireless networks , and advanced video coding technologies @xcite , mobile iptv @xcite has become viable over wireless cellular networks .",
    "several works @xcite have focused on the architecture and standardization for providing mobile iptv services . according to a recent study by cisco @xcite , mobile video traffic exceeded 50% of mobile data traffic for the first time in 2012 and was 53% of traffic by the end of 2013",
    ". mobile video will grow at a compound annual growth rate ( cagr ) of 69% between 2013 and 2018 , indicating that it is having an immediate impact on traffic today and in the future .",
    "most of the video traffic is from live tv and video - on - demand ( vod ) applications , and vod traffic will nearly triple by 2017 .",
    "therefore , the impact of video services on the performance of mobile networks is significant and must be investigated .    in wireless cellular networks , the channel conditions are time - varying because of multipath fading , radio interference , and user mobility . to provide robust transmissions and improve the spectral efficiency ,",
    "the adaptive modulation and coding ( amc ) scheme for wireless link adaption was proposed and analyzed @xcite .",
    "the amc scheme can dynamically adjust the modulation and coding scheme ( mcs ) of a wireless link according to its signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) , or channel quality indicator ( cqi ) .",
    "when the wireless link has a higher snr , sinr , or cqi , the mcs with a higher data rate can be used to improve the spectral efficiency .",
    "amc has been widely used in wireless communication networks , such as wimax @xcite , enhanced data rates for gsm evolution ( edge ) @xcite and high - speed downlink packet access ( hsdpa ) @xcite , for link adaptation . a closed - form expression for the spectral efficiency in single - carrier frequency - division multiple access ( sc - fdma )",
    "when amc is applied was derived in @xcite . in @xcite , the packet drop rate ,",
    "packet average delay and throughput were derived based on the markovian queueing model when amc is used .",
    "the blocking rate and spectrum consumption of multicast iptv services were studied by simulations in @xcite .",
    "all results in @xcite show that amc can significantly improve the spectral efficiency and network performance .",
    "three basic transport technologies for video streaming applications include unicast , broadcast , and multicast .",
    "broadcast and multicast schemes can provide a good bandwidth gain at the heavy load condition @xcite , but the implementation and management of amc in them for improving the spectral efficiency are complicated and difficult .",
    "for example , the issue of cqi decision and maintenance for each multicast group and the cqi feedback implosion problem @xcite still remain to be solved .",
    "unicast technology provides one - to - one connection between the base station and the mobile user .",
    "although the bandwidth gain of unicast scheme is low , it can support both interactive vod and live tv services with amc link adaptation for increasing the spectral efficiency .",
    "additionally , users prefer to watch video on - demand , rather than following a fixed schedule , to meet the anytime and anywhere requirement",
    ". therefore , unicast is still a popular and important transport scheme for mobile video streaming applications today .",
    "unicast iptv services are bandwidth hogs network applications and have a significant impact on the performance of wireless cellular networks .",
    "thus , to guarantee the network qos ( quality of services ) for subscribers , effective admission control , frequency planning , and resource allocation for unicast iptv services are extremely required . to achieve these goals , accurate performance analysis for unicast iptv services must be provided first .",
    "however , most of the performance analyses for iptv in wireless networks focus on the packet - level performance , such as the packet delay / jitter , packet loss rate , and video quality / distortion . such conventional packet - level rather than system - level performance analyses can not resolve the resource allocation issue .",
    "only few papers @xcite focused on the system - level performance analysis for unicast iptv services . the work @xcite developed a model to estimate the amount of wimax cell resources required for a video channel delivery , as a function of the number of video channels offered and the number of users on the cell .",
    "the paper @xcite analyzed and compared the performance of unicast , multicast and broadcast iptv services .",
    "another paper @xcite analyzed the blocking probability of unicast iptv services as a function of the average number of users .",
    "the authors in @xcite calculated the blocking probability of unicast tv services by erlang s loss formula with the m / m / c / c queueing model . in @xcite , the performance of unicast tv services",
    "was also assessed based on the markovian queueing model . among these works , only the analysis models in @xcite and @xcite consider the effect of mcss on the system performance .",
    "all these presented analysis models for unicast iptv services did not take user mobility into consideration .",
    "however , the user behavior such as the user mobility and the video watching time of a user can significantly affect the performance of networks supporting iptv services .",
    "hence , in this work the blocking rate , dropping rate , and bandwidth usage of unicast iptv services are analyzed based on the queueing model that considers both amc and user mobility .",
    "the differences of analysis methods between this work and @xcite are addressed as follows . in @xcite ,",
    "the analytical model is not based on the queueing model and assumes that the number of users requesting tv channels is known . in the work @xcite",
    ", the authors mentioned that their proposed queueing model can be solved by constructing the generating matrix and solving the corresponding balance equations .",
    "however , it is difficult to obtain the solutions using the generating matrix since the size of the generating matrix is large . therefore , they resorted to the approximate insensitive solutions to obtain the network performance .    in this work ,",
    "multi - dimensional system states are defined for the queueing model that considers both amc and user mobility .",
    "the difficulties of analyzing the proposed problem include the modeling of states , formulation of global balance equations , and verification of the availability of local balance equations .",
    "first , the queueing system with multi - dimensional states is rarely studied and found in the literature .",
    "second , the global balance equations with multi - dimensional states are not easy to be formulated . if the global balance equations can not be formulated , then it is impossible to show whether the local balance equations exist or not .",
    "when local balance equations do not exist , conventional methods to solve the queueing system can only appeal to the transition rate ( intensity ) matrix @xmath0 and obtain the stationary state probability vector @xmath1 by solving @xmath2 .",
    "however , it is very difficult to construct the matrix @xmath0 and solve @xmath2 because the size of the transition rate matrix @xmath0 for the queueing system with multi - dimensional states is usually very large @xcite .",
    "it is also impossible to derive the closed - form solution by solving @xmath2 . to overcome this problem , the unit vector @xmath3 is first introduced and then the precise state transition diagram is constructed in this paper",
    "next , the global balance equations are formulated based on the state transition diagram and the availability of local balance equations is verified . for the queueing model with user mobility",
    ", exact local balance equations do not exist .",
    "thus , approximate local balance equations are derived in this work .",
    "finally , the closed - form solution of the stationary state probability is derived using the local balance equations .",
    "the novelty and contributions of this work are summarized as follows .",
    "firstly , the user request arrival process , video watching time , user mobility , amc , and limited time - frequency resources are simultaneously considered in the queueing analysis .",
    "the proposed analysis approach for unicast iptv services is completely new .",
    "secondly , the closed - form solutions , which are never found in literature , for the blocking rate , dropping rate , and bandwidth usage of unicast iptv services are derived .",
    "thirdly , different mobility models are simulated to validate the accuracy of our analysis .",
    "finally , using the closed - form solutions , precise admission control and dynamic resource allocation can be implemented very efficiently .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the system model .",
    "section iii analyzes the performance of unicast iptv services over wireless cellular networks .",
    "numerical results and performance comparisons are presented in section iv .",
    "finally , the concluding remarks are made in section v.",
    "since mobile iptv services require extra large bandwidth compared with voice and data services @xcite , the performance of mobile networks is significantly dominated by mobile iptv traffic . to guarantee",
    "the qos of traditional voice / data services , the dedicated time - frequency resources for voice / data traffic and mobile iptv traffic can be completely isolated @xcite .",
    "thus , in this paper only the performance of unicast iptv services is analyzed .",
    "assume @xmath4 mcss with respective data rates @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 are used in the cellular mobile network .",
    "if the signal strength attenuation is mainly due to the free space path loss , then the adaptive mcs of each unicast connection is determined according to the user s distance to the base station .",
    "consequently , in this paper a cell is divided into @xmath4 concentric zones : zones 1 , 2 , @xmath7 , @xmath4 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : region ] .",
    "the area fraction , relative to the whole cell , of zone @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "the unicast connection for the user in zone @xmath9 uses the mcs at the data rate @xmath11 .",
    "the mcs rates satisfy @xmath12 .        to understand the effects of unicast iptv services on the performance of mobile networks , the following queueing model is presented and analyzed .",
    "the considered queueing system in this paper is limited to within a cell of the mobile network since the network operation of each cell is similar .",
    "the terminology _ bandwidth resources _ is used to represent the time - frequency resources in the wireless cellular network hereafter .",
    "the amount of bandwidth resources consumed by each unicast iptv connection , namely the bandwidth usage per unicast iptv connection , is assumed to be @xmath13 if the mcs rate @xmath11 is used .",
    "since the mcs rates satisfy @xmath12 , one can conclude that @xmath14 .",
    "notably , in the proposed model the unicast iptv streams can be constant bit rate ( cbr ) or variable bit rate ( vbr ) traffic .",
    "however , the bandwidth allocated for each unicast iptv connection must not be less than its average bit rate in a stable system .",
    "in addition , the average data bit rate of each unicast iptv stream , such as 128 kbps , is assumed to be the same .",
    "the total amount of bandwidth resources reserved for unicast iptv services in each cell is assumed to be @xmath15 .",
    "the arrival process of unicast iptv requests is presumed to follow the poisson process @xcite with total arrival rate @xmath16 .",
    "the users are uniformly located in the cell .",
    "thus , the average arrival rate of unicast iptv requests in zone @xmath9 can be denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "the watching time of each iptv request is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath18 .    to model the user mobility , the sojourn time of a user in each zone",
    "is also assumed to be exponentially distributed , i.e. , a markovian mobility model is assumed @xcite .",
    "however , the users in zone @xmath9 can only move to the adjacent zones , namely zone @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "that is , the transition rate of each user moving from zone @xmath21 to zone @xmath22 , denoted by @xmath23 , equals zero if @xmath24 .",
    "when a user moves from zone @xmath21 to zone @xmath22 , the used mcs rate of the connection for the user must be changed from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "notably , @xmath27",
    "if @xmath28 and @xmath29 . additionally , a user in zone 1 moving outward to the adjacent cells indicates a handover occurrence .",
    "first , the case that each user does not move to other zones during its session , i.e. , @xmath27 , is considered . in such a case",
    ", all connections are not required to change their mcss during their sessions .",
    "the system state @xmath30 is defined to be the @xmath4-tuple vector @xmath31 , where @xmath32 represents the number of connections using the mcs rate @xmath25 .",
    "the stationary state probability of @xmath30 is denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "the state transition diagram under the markovian model is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where @xmath34 = ( 0 , @xmath7 , 0 , @xmath35 , 0 , @xmath7 , 0 ) is the @xmath4-tuple vector that all elements are zero except the @xmath21-th element @xmath35 .",
    "since the amount of consumed bandwidth resources by all unicast iptv connections , @xmath36 , must not exceed the total amount of bandwidth resources @xmath15 , the sample space of system states is defined as @xmath37(@xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath7 , @xmath40)@xmath41 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , if @xmath42 , then the state @xmath43 disappears .",
    "if the bandwidth usage @xmath44 in the state @xmath30 is larger than @xmath45 , then the state @xmath46 disappears .",
    "notably , the proposed queueing model for unicast iptv services is a connection - based model rather than a packet - based one .",
    "the well - known classic queueing models can not be directly applied to solve the presented queueing problem .",
    "therefore , the closed - form solutions presented in this paper are completely novel .     and @xmath47 , @xmath48.,width=211 ]    when the system is in state @xmath30 and the bandwidth usage @xmath44 satisfies @xmath49 , then no user request can be rejected .",
    "hence , according to the state transition diagram in fig .",

    "however , the following local balance equation @xmath61 can satisfy all global balance equations ( [ eqn : g1 ] ) , ( [ eqn : g2 ] ) , and ( [ eqn : g3 ] ) .",
    "the reason is explained as follows . from ( [ eqn : l1 ] ) , one can deduce the following equations : @xmath62 @xmath63 obviously , both eqs . ( [ eqn : g1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : g2 ] ) can be derived by combining ( [ eqn : l2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : l3 ] ) , and eq .",
    "( [ eqn : l3 ] ) implies that ( [ eqn : g3 ] ) holds .    in queueing theory ,",
    "the global balance equations are a set of equations that in principle can always be solved to give the stationary state probabilities of a queueing system . in some situations ,",
    "terms on either side of the global balance equations cancel",
    ". then the global balance equations can be partitioned into a set of local balance equations .",
    "the structure of local balance equations is usually much simpler than global balance equations .",
    "if there exists a solution for the local balance equations , then this solution is also the solution of the global balance equations .",
    "accordingly , the stationary state probability @xmath33 can be solved using the local balance equation ( [ eqn : l1 ] ) .",
