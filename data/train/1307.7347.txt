    "consequently , we are able to make a topological phase transition ( bdi@xmath26ai@xmath26bdi ) to occur without gap closing by switching on and off the cdw .",
    "we have also analyzed silicene with the af order as another example with symmetry reducing .",
    "it is interesting that a topological phase transition without gap closing takes place within the same class a. however , there is a symmetry change whether the spin @xmath213 is a good quantum number and not .    when the symmetry is enhanced , the above reasoning no longer follows .",
    "as such examples we have considered symmetry increasing transitions ( aii@xmath214diii ) by way of introducing the sc order .",
    "although both the classes aii and diii are characterized by the @xmath2 index , their physical meaning is different .",
    "the @xmath2 index is essentially the spin - chern number in the class aii system , which becomes ill - defined as soon as the system moves into the sc phase ( diii ) due to the sc order .",
    "we have explicitly shown that a topological phase transition ( aii@xmath26diii@xmath214aii ) may occur without gap closing by switching on and off the sc order .    to conclude , we mention the implications of the adiabatic connection between the different sectors of topological number . up to now only the single - particle hamiltonian has been considered , but in reality the electron - electron interaction is effective , and the gaps are often induced by the order parameters .",
    "therefore , the character of the quantum critical phenomenon depends strongly on whether the continuous change of the topological number is possible or not .",
    "namely , when we write down the effective action for the quantum phase transition , there are multiple order parameters relevant to the gapless point when the continuous detour is possible to change the topological number .",
    "when the multiple topological phase transitions merges at one point , even more interesting quantum critical phenomenon is expected .",
    "the global view of the phase diagram taking into account all the possible classes will be an important direction to study the topological quantum transition .",

    "<S> we propose the generic principles how this is possible ( impossible ) by demonstrating various examples such as 1d polyacetylene with the charge - density - wave order , 2d silicene with the antiferromagnetic order , 2d silicene or quantum well made of hgte with superconducting proximity effects and 3d superconductor cu doped bi@xmath0se@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that such an unusual phenomenon can occur when we detour around the gap closing point provided the connection of the topological indices is lost along the detour path .    </S>",

    "<S> it is characterized by the topological indices such as the chern number and the @xmath2 index . </S>",
    "<S> when there are two topological distinct phases , a topological phase transition may occur between them . </S>",
    "<S> it has been generally accepted that the gap must close at the topological phase transition point since the topological index can not change its quantized value without gap closing . </S>",
    "<S> note that the topological index is only defined in the gapped system and remains unchanged for any adiabatic process . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively we may think of the edge or surface of the sample in a topological phase . </S>",
    "<S> gapless edge or surface modes appear because the boundary of the sample separates a topological state and the vacuum whose topological indices are zero . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon is known as the bulk - edge correspondence . </S>",
    "<S> we wonder if a topological phase transition can not occur without gap closing at all .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3    the topological classes are classified@xcite by the eigenvalues of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , represent the time - reversal , particle - hole and chiral symmetry operators as shown in fig.[figclass ] . </S>",
    "<S> there are ten classes , which are separated into two complex and eight real representations . </S>",
    "<S> the topological periodic table has been established as in fig.[figclass](b ) , which classifies all the possible homotopy groups and topological indices depending on the symmetry and dimensionality of the system . </S>",
    "<S> one important fact about this topological periodic table is that the adiabatic connection is possible between the two classes with the difference in dimensions by one@xcite . as for the eight real representations , </S>",
    "<S> this connection is summarized by the symmetry clock shown in fig.[figclass](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> namely , considering the hamiltonian @xmath10 which depends on both the @xmath11-dimensional real space coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath13 -dimensional momentum space coordinates @xmath14 , the mapping connecting the neighboring classes in the symmetry clock is possible by adding @xmath12- or @xmath14-dependent hamiltonian@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the essential dimensionality is @xmath15 and the adiabatic connection exists next to each other along the _ diagonal _ direction in the topological periodic table . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this _ diagonal _ shift , one can consider the _ horizontal _ shift , i.e. , dimensionality @xmath16 by introducing the defects such as vortex ( @xmath17 ) , and point defect ( @xmath18 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are several works on the _ vertical _ shift in the periodic table@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however in these cases , the gap closing is necessary for topological phase transitions .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study the adiabatic connection within the common dimensionality @xmath16 , and the possible change in the topological indices without closing the gap . </S>",
    "<S> we propose two principles . </S>",
    "<S> let the energy spectrum be given by @xmath19 with a topological phase transition taking place at a critical point @xmath20 of a certain parameter @xmath21 , where the gap closes . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that we can extend the hamiltonian to include a new parameter @xmath22 so that the energy spectrum is modified as@xmath23the phase transition point is @xmath24 in the @xmath25 phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> we may detour the point @xmath24 in the phase diagram , along which the gap never closes though a topological phase transition occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the second principle is that the topological number should become ill - defined by a symmetry change along the above detour . </S>",
    "<S> this invalidates requirements of the gap closing when the topological number changes .    </S>",
    "<S> we confirm these generic principles by demonstrating various examples . </S>",
    "<S> the first example is a simple one - dimensional model of polyacetylene with reduced symmetry at intermediate states ( bdi@xmath26ai@xmath26 bdi ) by way of the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a two - dimensional example of silicene with the antiferromagnet ( af ) order as another model with symmetry reducing . </S>",
    "<S> we then present three models with enhanced symmetry at intermediate state ( aii@xmath26diii@xmath26 aii ) by way of introducing the superconducting ( sc ) order@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are silicene and quantum well made of hgte as two - dimensional models , and superconductor cu doped bi@xmath0se@xmath1 as a three - dimensional model . </S>"
