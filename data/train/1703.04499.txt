    "the theory of time - homogeneous branching processes dates back to the work of galton and watson ( @xcite ) and the characterization of survival of these processes is very simple : the expectation of the offspring distribution must be strictly larger than 1 .",
    "one way to add complexity is to study the process on a spatial structure : the individuals live on the vertices of a graph @xmath5 and randomly reproduce ; the offspring are placed onto neighbouring vertices .",
    "if we look at the trajectory of lineages , they can be seen as random walks , which branch whenever an individual has more than one child , whence the name branching random walk ( briefly , brw ) for the process . in a brw survival",
    "can be global or local , meaning that with positive probability there will always be someone alive on the graph ( global survival ) or on a given vertex ( local survival ) .",
    "clearly local survival is more restrictive than global survival and both situations become more likely when individuals get more prolific . in continuous time an easy way to tune reproductions ( and to have markovianity ) is to fix @xmath6 and to attach to each particle living at @xmath7 and to each oriented edge @xmath8 of the graph an exponential clock whose parameter is proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "the same is repeated for all particles , sites and edges . whenever the clock rings , the corresponding particle at @xmath7 ( if still alive ) places an offspring at @xmath10 .",
    "the larger @xmath9 , the higher the probability of global and local survival will be .    to be more precise , the graph is endowed with a matrix @xmath11 of nonnegative _",
    "rates_. each particle has an exponential lifetime of mean 1 , and individuals living at @xmath7 place children at @xmath10 , one at a time , at time intervals with @xmath12 law ( death and reproduction clocks being all independent ) .",
    "starting with one particle at time 0 , it is well - known that there exist two critical parameters , @xmath13 such that for @xmath14 the brw goes extinct almost surely ; for @xmath15 $ ] there is local extinction but global survival ; for @xmath16 there is local survival ( when @xmath17 , depending on the cases , there can be global extinction or global survival ) .",
    "the two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 are called local ( or strong ) and global ( or weak ) critical parameters , respectively . these parameters in principle depend on the starting vertex , but they are actually equal for all vertices in the same irreducible class ( for more details , also on the critical cases , see section [ sec : basic ] ) .",
    "the characterization of @xmath0 in terms of the matrix @xmath18 has been known for quite a while . indeed ,",
    "pemantle and stacey proved ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.1 ) ) that if the graph @xmath5 is irreducible , @xmath19 ( where by @xmath20 we mean the adjacency matrix of @xmath5 ) and @xmath21 , ( where @xmath22 is the @xmath23 element of the @xmath24-th power of the matrix @xmath18 ) , then @xmath25 .",
    "this result has been extended to irreducible brws on multigraphs by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) and then to generic brws with rates @xmath18 by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) .",
    "the behaviour at @xmath26 is also understood : ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.5 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.7 ) prove that there is almost sure extinction in continuous time , in the case of multigraphs and in general , respectively .",
    "the discrete - time case has been described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) .",
    "the critical behaviour was also investigated independently , with different techniques , in @xcite .",
    "the characterization of @xmath1 is more challenging and is the main aim of this paper . if @xmath27 and @xmath19 , then @xmath28 : it is also said that there is no weak phase .",
    "the absence of weak phase can be found in many cases which , like @xmath29 , are nonamenable .",
    "nonamenability by itself is neither necessary nor sufficient for @xmath28 , as was proven in @xcite . nevertheless adding some kind of regularity to the graph , like quasi - transitivity ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) ) or some more general regularity ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.6 ) ) turns nonamenability into an equivalent condition for the absence of weak phase .",
    "the presence of the weak phase was first observed on regular trees @xmath30 ( endowed with @xmath31 ) and in that case , @xmath32 was computed in @xcite ( note that vertex transitivity makes @xmath1 easy to determine , since the total progeny is a galton - watson process ) . when either the graph or @xmath18 lack regularity , the characterization of @xmath1 is not obvious .",
    "for instance , on galton - watson trees , only some bounds for @xmath1 are known ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we note that it is possible to define @xmath0 using the entire sequence @xmath33 : indeed one has @xmath34 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) ) .",
    "this result has an intuitive explanation in the fact that the expected value of the cardinality of the set of @xmath35-th generation descendants living at @xmath7 is @xmath36 .",
    "then , moving to @xmath1 it would be natural to conjecture that @xmath37 .",
    "the first thing to note is that this conjecture has to be modified since in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 2 ) we have a brw where @xmath38 .",
    "we denote by @xmath39 the last limit and then look for conditions guaranteeing that @xmath3 .",
    "the main result of this paper , theorem  [ thm : main ] , states that for a generic continuous - time brw , two uniformity conditions , ( u1 ) and ( u2 ) , together are sufficient for @xmath3 ( see section  [ sec : main ] for the definition of these conditions ) .",
    "we mention here that an adjacency matrix always satisfies ( u2 ) and , in the case of multigraphs with @xmath19 , it was already known that ( u1 ) was a sufficient condition for @xmath3 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2 ) ) . for generic brws",
    ", the proof requires a new and different technique , which heavily relies on multidimensional generating functions and their fixed points ( generating function techniques have proven to be excellent tools to identify the extinction probabilities of a brw , see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "so far in the general case it was proven that @xmath3 is true for brws which can be projected onto finite spaces , namely the @xmath40-brws ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.5 ) ) .",
    "theorem  [ thm : main ] extends this result , since @xmath40-brws satisfy the two conditions ( u1 ) and ( u2 ) , while there are examples of brws satisfying the uniformity conditions without being @xmath40-brws ( for instance , a periodic tree - like brw ) .",
    "moreover , again a uniformity request , more restrictive than ( u1 ) , had proven to be sufficient for @xmath3 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.6 ) ) .    here is an outline of the paper . in section  [ sec :",
    "basic ] we formally define the process , its local and global survival and the associated critical parameters .",
    "we also introduce the generating function @xmath41 of the brw and recall theorem  [ th : survival ] which links global survival with some properties of @xmath41 . in section  [ sec : main ] we first prove theorem  [ thm : main ]  and then theorem  [ th : mapping ] , which gives a sufficient condition for the uniformity condition ( u1 ) to hold . section  [ sec : examples ] is devoted to examples where the equality @xmath3 holds . the first example is given by periodic tree - like brws , which we define in this paper , much in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "in particular they are a family of self - similar brws , which can be neither quasi - transitive nor @xmath40-brws .",
    "to figure an idea of the self - similarity we require , one can think of brws on tree - like graphs .",
    "tree - like structures arise naturally in the context of complex networks .",
    "in particular , many social and information networks present a large - scale tree - like structure or a hierarchical structure ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the global survival of this family of processes could not be treated with the previously known techniques .",
    "the second example is given by continuous - time branching processes in varying environment : namely branching processes where individuals breed accordingly to a poisson process whose parameter depends on the generation .",
    "it suffices to interpret generations as space variables and brw techniques apply .",
    "we also show that , even for such a particular law of the process , when @xmath17 still global extinction and global survival are both possible .",
    "examples  [ exmp : treeandz ] and [ exmp : star ] show that ( u1 ) is not necessary for @xmath3 ( in the first case @xmath42 , in the second case @xmath28 ) .",
    "example  [ exmp : backtotheorigin ] shows that ( u2 ) is not necessary for @xmath3 .",
    "finally example  [ exmp : finally ] we construct an irreducible brw where @xmath4 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , in the reducible case , it can even happen that @xmath3 if the process starts from certain vertices and @xmath4 if it starts from other vertices ( see example  [ exmp : finally ] ) .",

    "the couple @xmath43 identifies the brw , that is a family of continuous - time processes , depending on a positive parameter @xmath9 , where each particle has an exponentially distributed random lifetime with parameter 1 .",
    "when @xmath6 is fixed , for each particle alive at @xmath7 , there is a clock which rings at @xmath12-distributed intervals ; each time the clock rings the particle places one newborn at @xmath10 .",
    "we say that the @xmath9-brw has a death rate 1 and a reproduction rate @xmath47 from @xmath7 to @xmath10 .",
    "all the particles behave independently .",
    "we observe ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark  2.1 ) ) that the assumption of a non - constant death rate does not represent a significant generalization . with a slight abuse of notation , when there is no ambiguity , we omit the dependence on @xmath9 and denote by brw also the process with a fixed @xmath9 .",
    "it has to be mentioned that under the name brw one can find , in the literature , several kinds of processes : for instance processes in discrete time , with no death , where parents randomly walk either before or after breeding , on continuous space , in random environment or with multiple types ( @xcite just to mention a few ) . to the process @xmath43 we associate a graph @xmath48 where @xmath49 if and only if @xmath50 .",
