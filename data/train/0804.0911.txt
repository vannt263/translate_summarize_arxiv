    "<S> mercury - based cuprates hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 with 0 @xmath2 0.2 ( hg1201 ) are the superconductors with a single cuo@xmath0 layer in unit cell and the optimally oxidized one has the highest @xmath3 = 98 k among the ever reported single - cuo@xmath0-layer superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> double cuo@xmath0 layered cuprates hgba@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath4 with 0.05 @xmath2 0.35 ( hg1212 ) have the highest @xmath3 = 127 k at the optimal oxygen concentration . </S>",
    "<S> this is the highest @xmath3 among the ever reported double - cuo@xmath0-layer superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the hg1201 has the nearly perfect fat cuo@xmath0 plane . </S>",
    "<S> the hg1212 has the flattest cuo@xmath0 plane among the other lower @xmath3 double - layer cuprates , which is associated with the mystery of the highest @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> both systems have a pseudo spin - gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum of the normal states . in this article , we present the microscopic studies of magnetic and electric properties of the hg - based superconducting cuprates using nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) techniques . </S>",
    "<S> nmr and nqr are powerful to detect local information through the nuclear sites in materials and have supplied us with information on low frequency magnetic response of electronic systems . </S>",
    "<S> although the structure analysis indicates the flat cuo@xmath0 planes , zero field @xmath5cu nqr spectra , which are sensitive to local electric charge distribution , show inhomogeneous broadening . </S>",
    "<S> the local electrostatic states are rather inhomogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> although the @xmath6-wave superconductivity must be fragile to imperfection and non - magnetic impurities , the pure hg - based superconducting cuprates show impure @xmath5cu nqr spectra but rather robust pseudo spin - gap in the @xmath7cu nmr knight shift and nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate over the wide doping regions . </S>",
    "<S> there had been an issue whether the pseudo spin - gap results from a double - layer coupling or a single layer anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> the nmr results for hg1201 served as the evidence for the existence of the single - layer pseudo spin - gap . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudo spin - gap is explained by a precursory phenomena of superconducting pairing fluctuations or spin singlet correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the different doping dependence of the pseudo spin - gap of hg1201 and hg1212 is associated with the different fermi surface contour . </S>",
    "<S> the similar temperature dependence of the @xmath8hg and the @xmath7cu nuclear spin - lattice relaxation times indicates uniform interlayer coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the double - layer coupling effect is revisited through the comparison of hg1201 and hg1212 . </S>"
