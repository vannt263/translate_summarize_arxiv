    "during the last decade mounting evidence has emerged for the existence of long - period oscillations in a handful of pulsars  @xcite .",
    "an outstanding example of this kind of phenomenon is observed in psr 1828 - 11  @xcite .",
    "its timing residuals are modulated with periods of 256 and 511 days , while a 1009-day periodicity is inferred with lower confidence .",
    "these timing residuals coincide with periodic modulations of the pulse shape , which is a strong indication for the precessional motion(s ) of the pulsar with the periods quoted above  @xcite . in fact",
    ", various models of precessing neutron stars  @xcite fit the timing data fairly well .",
    "however , it is known that free precession is incompatible with the existence of a superfluid in the pulsar s interior if the superfluid is strongly coupled to the normal fluid  @xcite .",
    "the mutual friction for the superfluids present in the crust and core of neutron stars , which are derived using microscopic calculations , cover a broad range of values .",
    "a reliable calculation necessarily involves the superconducting and superfluid properties of the fluid(s ) and the non - superconducting material , which resists to vortex motion .",
    "while precession remains a viable model for the quasiperiodic oscillations observed in pulsar timing data , here we follow a different route  @xcite by exploring the propagation of tkachenko modes in pulsars as the source of long term variations .",
    "charge neutral superfluids in neutron star interiors rotate by forming an array of singly quantized vortices . in their lowest energy state",
    "the vortices form a two - dimensional triangular lattice .",
    "the lattice supports collective elastic modes , tkachenko waves , in which the vortices are displaced parallel to each other  @xcite .",
    "their undamped propagation would lead to variations of the angular momentum of the superfluid due to the local variations of the density of the vortex lines as well as periodic variations in the rotation and spin - down speeds of the star .",
    "ruderman @xcite pointed out that the frequency of the tkachenko modes is of the order of several hundred days and these modes could be responsible for the quasiperiodic timing residuals observed in the crab pulsar .",
    "little attention has been paid to the role played by the tkachenko modes in neutron stars since ruderman s 1970 paper .",
    "here we reinvestigate the propagation of tkachenko modes in neutron star superfluids and calculate how these modes are damped by mutual friction and the shear viscosity of normal matter .",
    "these factors are clearly important for the continuous propagation of these modes , which would certainly lead to observable effects .",
    "provided that the observed variations are indeed caused by the shear modes of the lattice we can ask the question : what do the quasi - sinusoidal variations tell us about the microscopic physics governing superfluids in neutron stars ?    this question can be answered by describing the physics present at micro- and mesoscopic scales ( the upper limit on these scales is set by the size of the neutron vortex ) in terms of the few parameters that enter the equations of superfluid hydrodynamics .",
    "these parameters include the kinetic coefficients and other local characteristics ( e.  g. , density , baryon and lepton fractions , etc ) .",
    "the predictions obtained within this hydrodynamic description can be presented in a form that is independent of the details of physics at the micro- and mesoscopic scales .    in this paper",
    "we pursue this `` model independent '' approach , although some comments about the physics present at intermediate scales are in order . a key problem concerning the crust of neutron stars",
    "is the question of whether neutron vortices are pinned to the crustal nuclei both under static and dynamical conditions .",
    "the static problem always has pinning solutions for infinitesimally attractive interactions between a neutron vortex and a nucleus ( for repulsive interactions the vortex is localized in between the lattice sites )  @xcite .",
    "the dynamical problem of repinning under the action of external superflow  @xcite allows for repinning solutions only for strong pinning potentials and current estimates for the pinning energy do not favor repinning solutions .",
    "however , if the axisymmetry of the problem is lost , as in the case of precessing neutron stars , the vortices may not pin at all  @xcite .",
    "another issue concerning neutron star crusts is that they may often undergo starquakes  @xcite , which drive the vortex lattice out of its equilibrium state .",
    "in fact , the form of the lattice may change from a triangular shape into some other structure reflecting the symmetries of the underlying nuclear lattice . moreover , other possible scenarios include cases where the vortices may acquire multiple quanta of circulation or the lattice may contain impurities and vacancies .",
    "thus , our working assumption that the ground state of the lattice consists of a simple triangular array of vortices may not be applicable to the crusts of frequently quaking neutron stars .    regarding the cores of neutron stars , a major question is whether the proton fluid is a type - i  @xcite or type - ii superconductor  @xcite ( it may also become unpaired at high densities ) .",
    "the friction in the case of type - ii superconductors is large  @xcite , which implies that precession is impossible .",
    "if , however , the proton fluid is a type - i superconductor the friction is found to be small and compatible with precession  @xcite .    finally , we would like to point our that the superfluids may develop quantum turbulence when the velocity difference between the superfluid and the normal fluid exceeds a certain critical value .",
    "turbulent states in superfluid he may be generated in many ways , e.  g. , by driving the normal fluid along the vortex lines through a temperature gradient .",
    "neutron stars superfluids may also develop turbulent states  @xcite , which could be caused either by unstable precession  @xcite or tectonic activity in the crusts  @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [",
    "sec : hydro ] we recapitulate the equations of superfluid hydrodynamics that include the combined effects of vortex tension , mutual friction , and shear viscosity . sec .",

    "it is convenient at this point to discuss the three main length scales that appear in our study in more detail .",
    "the relevant length scales are the vortex core radius @xmath1  cm , the intervortex spacing @xmath2  cm , and the size of the superfluid phase @xmath3  cm ( we refer to these three different scales as micro , meso , and macroscopic scales ) .",
    "a hydrodynamic description requires averaging over the mesoscopic scales . in order to describe the deformations of the vortex lattice",
    ", one needs an additional dynamical variable , the local deformation of the vortex lattice @xmath4 , which can be incorporated into the bekarevich - khalatnikov superfluid hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "a hydrodynamic description of superfluids that includes lattice deformations has been studied by a number of authors  @xcite and in this work we use the baym - chandler version of superfluid hydrodynamics  @xcite to study the tkachenko modes and their damping due to mutual friction and shear viscosity .",
    "the fluid motions are naturally separated into the center of mass motion ( known as first sound ) and second sound , which corresponds to temperature dependent relative oscillations between the superfluid and the normal component .",
    "these motions are conveniently described in terms of the total mass current @xmath5 and the relative velocity @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) are the superfluid ( normal fluid ) density and velocity , respectively .",

    "the dissipative terms in the hydrodynamic equations defined above ( such as the mutual friction forces ) are the most general expressions that can be used in the description of a rectilinear vortex lattice in equilibrium that are still compatible with the conservation laws and the assumption that the dissipative function is a positive quadratic form of the perturbations ( higher order terms are neglected ) . furthermore",
    ", we would like to remark that baym - chandler hydrodynamics only describes the linear order corrections in the lattice displacements , which are considered to be small .",
    "the neutron vortex lattice in neutron stars may , however , become unstable towards forming a tangle with turbulent superfluid flow , which would require a thorough revision of the hydrodynamic equations . in particular , the form of the mutual friction force ( [ mf ] ) should be changed to the one suggested by groter and mellink  @xcite where @xmath35 .",

    "this value of the temperature is a realistic upper bound on the temperature in the core of neutron stars except for very young objects such as the vela and crab pulsars . for colder stars the viscosity could be a few orders of magnitude larger because @xmath123 .",
    "our results indicate that tkachenko modes are broadly consistent with the weakly coupled theories between the superfluid and the normal fluid , independent of the value the shear viscosity .",
    "the subclass with @xmath124 has periods that are consistent with the lowest observed periodicity in psr 1828 - 11 of 256 days .",
    "the existence of tkachenko modes in the strongly coupled region depends on the shear viscosity of normal matter . for low viscosities",
    "the tkachenko modes are ( in strong coupling ) renormalized to values that are a few times smaller than their non - dissipative limits .",
    "this implies that in strong coupling the tkachenko oscillations have periods that are larger than their non - dissipative counterparts .",
    "in fact , the damping caused by mutual friction is not always strong enough to preclude an oscillatory behavior .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the long term variation in the spin of psr 1828 - 11 can in principle be explained in terms of tkachenko oscillations within superfluid shells for a broad range of values of the mutual friction and the normal fluid shear viscosity .",
    "finally , we note that larger wave vector oscillations corresponding to periodic motions on shorter length scales may lead to phenomena that are responsible for the observed timing noise in pulsars .",
    "our model necessarily involves certain approximations .",
    "for instance , we have adopted the two - fluid superfluid hydrodynamics , which should be modified in order to account for the multiple fluids in the neutron star s core  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the cylindrical symmetry of our setup and the assumption of uniform density need to be relaxed in more realistic treatments of spherical superfluid shells with density gradients .",
