    "galaxies do not appear in arbitrary combinations of luminosity , mass and shape , but instead obey empirical scaling relations ( such as the fundamental plane for early - type galaxies ) .",
    "explaining the origin , and cosmic evolution , of the scaling relations is a fundamental goal of galaxy formation theories .",
    "as far as disk galaxies are concerned , the hierarchical structure formation scenario predicts a correlation between size and stellar mass , with width depending on the distribution of the initial spin of the dark halos @xcite . at any given mass ,",
    "the expected distribution of sizes is well - approximated by a log - normal distribution .",
    "qualitatively , this prediction is quite robust , although the exact forms of the correlation and the distribution depend on the details of baryonic processes such as energy feedback from star formation and bulge instability @xcite .",
    "therefore , measuring the shape and width of the correlation provides not only a test of the standard paradigm , but also valuable information on the poorly - understood baryonic processes happening at sub - galactic scales .    from an empirical point of view",
    ", the relation between size , luminosity ( or equivalently surface brightness ) and stellar mass is well established for disk galaxies in the local universe @xcite .",
    "analysis of suitable objects in the sloan digital sky survey shows that at any given mass ( luminosity ) the distribution of galaxies is indeed well - approximated as log - normal , although the scaling with mass of the characteristic size and the width of the distribution are non - trivial . defining disk galaxies as those being well - fit by a single component with index @xmath1 , @xcite",
    "find that above a characteristic stellar mass ( @xmath2 corresponding to approximately m@xmath3 ) , size scales rapidly with stellar mass ( @xmath4 ) and the scatter is relatively small ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "below the characteristic stellar mass the correlation flattens ( @xmath6 ) and the scatter increases significantly ( @xmath7 ) .    at intermediate redshift ( @xmath8 )",
    "the nature and interpretation of the size - luminosity or size - mass relation is more uncertain .",
    "several authors @xcite have used hubble space telescope images to determine the sizes of intermediate and high ( @xmath9 ) redshift galaxies , down to the resolution and completeness limits of hst ( roughly equivalent to 1  kpc and 10@xmath10 ) .",
    "recent studies conclude , taking selection effects into account , that there is significant evolution in the size - luminosity relation @xcite . however , it is hard to disentangle luminosity evolution from size evolution , to ensure that samples at different redshifts are directly comparable , and to compare results from different studies , as the selection criteria are often similar but not identical ( color vs. morphology ; morphology determined via index vs.  bulge to disk decomposition vs.  concentration parameter vs. visual classification ) .",
    "overall , it appears that disk galaxy evolution can not be explained by pure luminosity or pure size evolution , but requires a combination of both .",
    "in contrast , the relation between size and stellar mass appears to have changed very little since @xmath11 @xcite , much less than would be expected in the naive model where stellar mass and size are proportional to the virial mass and radius ( and hence size is expected to scale as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the hubble parameter ) .",
    "rather , galaxies appear to be growing `` inside - out '' in scale radius as their stellar mass increases such that the size - mass relation is preserved over cosmic time @xcite . it has been suggested that galaxy evolution models that take into account the ever - increasing concentration of dark matter halos , and the further effect of baryons via adiabatic contraction could provide the physics required to reproduce the observed trend @xcite , although this may make it more difficult to reproduce simultaneously other scaling laws , for example the tully - fisher @xcite relation @xcite .",
    "lower mass ( @xmath14 ) galaxies are even less well understood . while the local size - mass relations of @xcite for low ( @xmath1 ) and high ( @xmath15 ) index objects diverge , the interpretation of index as a morphological galaxy classifier becomes more uncertain at lower masses ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at the same time , the measurement of the structural parameters themselves becomes harder as the galaxy size decreases .",
    "nevertheless , such small galaxies are important objects to understand : the luminous compact blue galaxies first noted by @xcite appear in large numbers at intermediate redshifts in deep hst images @xcite , but evolve very rapidly to vanishing abundance in the local universe .",
    "what becomes of these objects , which represent sites of small - scale but vigorous star formation , is a topic of some debate , with dwarf spheroids @xcite and the bulges of disk galaxies @xcite the principle candidates .",
    "gravitational lensing is a powerful tool with which to extend the investigation of scaling laws over cosmic time @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , the lensing geometry provides a precise and almost model - independent measure of total mass of the lens galaxy .",
    "since the lens galaxies are mostly early - type galaxies ( or the bulges of spirals ) , this gives a new handle on the mass profile of these systems @xcite and hence , for example , on the relationship between stellar and total mass @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the background source is typically magnified by a factor of @xmath1610 , mostly in the form of a stretch along the azimuthal direction . while lensing preserves surface brightness , the increase in apparent size of the lensed source means that the number of pixels at any one surface brightness also increases , such that the isophotes are observed at higher signal - to - noise .",
    "thus , gravitational lenses act as natural telescopes , allowing one to gain a factor of @xmath17 in sensitivity and spatial resolution , and thus improve markedly our ability to study the size and dynamical mass ( through rotation curves ) of intermediate and high redshift galaxies .",
    "for example , studies of the internal structure of faint blue galaxies  @xcite , and in particular the most compact of these @xcite , are currently limited by the resolution of hst @xcite .",
    "when magnified by a gravitational lens , such objects become well - resolved .",
    "thanks to the dedicated efforts of several groups , the number of known gravitational lenses is increasing dramatically : it is now possible to envision statistical studies of relatively large sample of lensing or lensed galaxies in the near future .    in this paper",
    "we present multi - color high - resolution images of the gravitational lens system @xcite , obtained with both the hubble space telescope and with the laser guide star adaptive optics ( lgsao ) system on keck ii .",
    "the scientific goal of the analysis of this case study is two - fold .",
    "first , we perform a detailed comparison of the results of the lens modeling across bands , showing that  when a bright nearby star is available for tip - tilt correction and conditions are favorable  the most important parameters can be measured with comparable accuracy with hst and keck - lgsao .",
    "second , we exploit this particular cosmic telescope to achieve super - resolution of the source galaxy .",

    "we derive the index , size , and stellar mass of the source , and show that using gravitational telescopes the size - mass relation may be extended by an order of magnitude in size with respect to current studies , thus allowing one to probe , for example , whether the change in slope and intrinsic scatter below the characteristic mass persists to higher redshifts .",

    "on december 11 , 2006 , we imaged with the lgsao system on the keck ii telescope .",
    "the images were taken in the with the near - infrared camera ( nirc2 ) in the wide field ( @xmath26 ) of view . the pixel scale for this configuration is @xmath27pix@xmath25 .",
    "a total of 3120 seconds of exposure was obtained . to avoid saturating stars in the field ,",
    "individual exposures were 1 minute in duration ( divided into two 30-second co - adds ) .",
    "a dither was executed after every set of 2 exposures to improve the sky sampling .",
    "dithers were randomly chosen using a script with a circular dither pattern of radius @xmath28 .",
    "the laser was positioned at the center of each frame , rather than fixed on the central galaxy .",
    "steinbring et al.(2007 , submitted ) demonstrate that this method provides a more uniform ao correction over a larger area , in comparison with the fixed laser method .",
    "observing conditions during the run were good .",
    "the observations were made as part of the center for adaptive optics treasury survey ( cats , larkin et al .",
    "2007 , in prep ) , which aims to image @xmath29 distant galaxies with keck adaptive optics .",
    "the images were processed with the cats reduction procedure described in @xcite . a sky frame and a sky flat were created from the individual science exposures after masking objects .",
    "frames were then flat - fielded and sky - subtracted .",
    "the images were de - warped to correct for known camera distortions . the frames were aligned by centroiding on objects in the field , and finally co - added to produce the final image .",
    "the final processed image shows three unsaturated stars lying within @xmath30 of the lens position .",
    "two of these stars are between the tip - tilt star and the lens .",
    "the third lies on the opposite side of lens from the tip - tilt star .",
    "these stars provide a very strong constraint on the point - spread - function ( psf ) , which is often difficult to track for ao observations . a further constraint on",
    "the psf comes from observations of a psf star - pair .",
    "the star - pair observations were made immediately following the lens observations .",
    "we picked a star pair that had a tip - tilt / psf orientation and separation similar to the tip - tilt / lens system . as a result",
    ", the lens observation has one of the best constrained psfs ever obtained for an extragalactic ao observation .",
    "a visual inspection of the stars in the field reveals an approximate double gaussian profile , as used in simple models of adaptive optics psfs @xcite .",
    "the small - scale component of this profile was observed to have a fwhm of @xmath31 pixels , or @xmath32  arcsec .",
    "this is significantly larger than the diffraction limit of keck in the k - band ( @xmath33 ) , but is primarily the result of using the wide - field camera which slightly under - samples the psf . the large - scale gaussian component has a fwhm of @xmath34  arcsec , indicating very good seeing . from this simple psf picture",
    "we estimate the strehl ratio to be approximately 0.35 for all the psf stars , demonstrating consistently good ao performance in these observations .",
    "the lens system was observed with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and with the near infrared camera and multi object spectrograph ( nicmos ) on board hst on november 5 2006 , as part of _ hst _ program 10494 ( pi : koopmans ) .",
    "one - orbit integrations were obtained through filters f555w ( 2200s ) and f814w ( 2272s ) with the wide field camera centering the lens on the wfc1 aperture , in the center of the second ccd .",
    "four sub - exposures were obtained with a half - integer pixel offset ( acs - wfc - dither - box ) to ensure proper cosmic ray removal and sampling of the point spread function .",
    "a one orbit integration with the nic2 camera through filter f160w was obtained with nicmos in multiaccum mode for a total exposure time of 2560s . as with acs ,",
    "the integration was split in four sub - exposures with a semi - integer pixel offset to ensure proper cosmic ray / defect removal and improve sampling of the point spread function .",
    "the acs data were reduced using multidrizzle @xcite as described in @xcite .",
    "the nicmos data were reduced using a set of iraf scripts based on the dither package @xcite , as described in @xcite .",
    "the output pixel size was set to match that of nirc2 ( @xmath35 ) to facilitate comparison between the hst and reduced nirc2 images .",
    "in order to predict accurately the data given a model lens image , we must convolve it with the point spread function ( psf ) of the telescope . for the instruments on hst the psf is calculable from the engineering parameters that characterize the optics and detectors , using the tinytim package @xcite .",
    "however , the psf varies over time , both as a result of the `` breathing '' of the telescope over the course of an orbit , but also monotonically as the system ages : the tiny tim approximation is not always sufficient .",
    "somewhat similarly , the psf derived from first principles for an adaptive optics system is the sum of a moffat profile for the seeing disk , and the diffraction pattern due to the telescope itself . in practice ,",
    "the seeing , and the strehl ratio , vary over the course of a set of observations , making a priori predictions of the psf of limited use .    in principle",
    ", one could include some variable parameters to describe the model psfs introduced above , and then fit for them simultaneously with the lens model parameters .",
    "we show in section  [ sect : modelresults ] that there is indeed enough information in our data to constrain the psf , thanks to the multiple - images produced by the lens , but defer the investigation of model psf parameters to further work . here",
    "we take a pragmatic approach and use nearby unsaturated stars as estimates of the psf at the position of the lens . for the case of",

    "the source behind appears to be about a factor of @xmath41 smaller than the average local galaxy @xcite , putting it approximately 3-@xmath42 below the local size - mass relation for galaxies with low index .",
    "the distant gems data do not extend to small enough masses to allow for a direct comparison with our measurement .",
    "however , bringing our point into agreement with the typical @xmath43 galaxy from gems would require a somewhat marked flattening of the size - magnitude relation at masses lower than @xmath44 since redshift  0.6 , which appears unlikely given the very modest evolution observed at masses above @xmath44 : @xcite find a constant size - mass relation ; @xcite measure @xmath45 for disk - like galaxies , predicting that the mean object at @xmath46 is only about @xmath47 times the size of the mean local disk - like galaxy . even comparing with the incomplete gems data at @xmath48 (",
    "* figure 10 ) we see that our object is unusually small .",
    "thus we conclude that the source galaxy behind is , relative to existing surveys , somewhat extreme in terms of mass and size , _ if it is indeed a disk galaxy_.    such compact galaxies have , however , been well - studied .",

    "these objects comprise a small fraction of the ubiquitous faint blue galaxies reviewed by @xcite . extending the sample to intermediate redshift and focusing on the higher luminosity members ( @xmath52 ) , @xcite found using high resolution spectroscopy that these objects appear more similar to local hii galaxies ( dwarf galaxies showing violent star formation activity ) , and suggested that these systems will evolve into today s dwarf spheroids .",
    "this conclusion was also reached by @xcite in an extension of that work , although they note that the number densities are such that not all compact galaxies at intermediate redshift can be progenitors of spheroids .",
    "however , @xcite argue that the observed narrow emission line widths may not represent the depth of the whole galaxy potential , and instead argue on the basis of the stellar masses they infer from their spectra and photometry that the more luminous , compact galaxies are more likely the progenitors of the bulges of present - day massive spiral galaxies . at the stellar mass scale inferred in this work ( @xmath53 ) , the source behind appears closer to the low - luminosity end of the samples of @xcite and @xcite , but is almost a factor of two smaller than the limiting size of their sample ( @xmath54 ) and is fully resolved . indeed",

    "the low index measured would suggest not , placing it firmly in the disk - like samples of the literature .",

    "the consistency in morphology between the observation filters is indicative of a regular spheroid ( although the residual structure in the bluer filters would argue against a highly - evolved , smooth stellar distribution .",

    "[ fig : smr ] we show the local , and @xmath43 , size - mass relations for `` elliptical '' ( @xmath55 ) galaxies from sdss and gems  @xcite , and can see that the source behind sits rather more comfortably with these relations , albeit at significantly ( a factor of 2  4 ) lower mass .",
    "our results demonstrate that , using a gravitational telescope to super - resolve the source , it is possible to study in considerable detail atypical sources that may well be missed or excluded by non - lensed surveys .",
    "in fact , size - mass studies at redshift  0.5 and above have necessarily focused on the high luminosity end , and have inevitably included a size cut to remove stars from the catalogs , before a further completeness cut that discards the least massive galaxies .",
    "it is not clear just how many small galaxies are being overlooked in this way .",
    "the higher resolution afforded by our gravitational telescope allows us to study the structure and surface brightness profiles of the compact blue galaxies in much greater detail and with higher precision , and to extend the investigation to smaller sizes still . for comparison ,",
    "the total magnification provided by is @xmath56 , indicating an angular resolution in the source plane of approximately 0.01  arcsec .",
    "the  @xmath57 accuracy we obtain on our size measurement indicates that we are still some way from the limit imposed by the resolution of our optics .",
    "indeed we note that this accuracy can be improved by a further factor of 2 by simply using a more flexible lens model .",
    "having demonstrated the power of this method , a larger sample of objects is needed in order to infer statistically meaningful conclusions about the low mass / size tail of the mass - size relation . as clearly discussed by @xcite , to achieve this goal",
    "it is crucial to understand the selection function of the objects being used in the size - mass relation study . due to a form of the so - called magnification bias ,",
    "gravitational lens surveys such as slacs tend to favor compact sources .",
    "slacs lenses were selected from ( spectroscopic ) observations where the system is essentially unresolved , meaning that lens systems with high total magnification are preferentially detected .",
    "this bias is strongest when the source is point - like , much smaller than the size of the fiber and the einstein radius ( @xmath58  arcsec ) .",
    "thus , it is not so surprising that the first source to be studied is compact .",
    "this realization implies that when performing statistical analyses of the size - mass relation of lensed galaxies it will be necessary to use monte carlo simulations to understand and quantify the selection function of multiple image systems . applying our methodology to other lens systems ,",
    "will , once the selection effects are quantified , extend this study to join the existing statistical analyses of higher - mass disks , to probe the small size ( low angular momentum ) regime .",
    "the slacs lenses are well - suited to this task : the efficiency of the survey is such that some 100 high - magnification systems like are expected to be found by the end of the program .",
    "( the number of systems currently confirmed using high resolution imaging is already close to this figure . )",
    "extending the study to sources at even higher redshifts requires more lenses to be discovered at greater distances : the sl2s survey @xcite is expected to discover @xmath59 suitable systems , with sources at redshifts of  1.0 and higher .",
    "however , the detection of these systems ( via a ground - based imaging survey in the @xmath60- and @xmath61-bands ) will lead to different selection effects than those present in the slacs survey , and will again require monte carlo simulations in order to understand them .    the different identification schemes of the slacs and sl2s survey introduce also a different selection effect in terms of stellar population , which will have to be modeled and taken into account when interpreting the results .",
    "slacs sources are emission line selected and will therefore be representative of actively star - forming galaxies , directly comparable with galaxies selected in narrow band surveys .",
    "sl2s sources are continuum - selected and contain a mix of actively star - forming , post - starburst and quiescent stellar populations , directly comparable with the galaxy population studied by wide field hst surveys in similar broad bandpasses .",
    "an additional implication of the lensing selection effect is that the magnification bias in some sense increases the power of a galaxy survey , by picking out the smallest objects and then making them measurable . with current technology ,",
    "gravitational telescopes are the only way of accurately measuring such tiny objects .",
    "we find that high quality images from are capable of providing very similar precision on simple lens and source model parameters to typical datasets from and . the data themselves contain information about the most appropriate psf model to use , to the extent that a set of nearby unsaturated stars can be fruitfully compared using suitable statistics that are sensitive to the goodness - of - fit .",
    "we estimate that even for the lgsao imaging this way of modeling the psf allows a photometric precision of 0.05 mag .",
    "however , the calibration of isothermal however , the calibration of _ isothermal _ galaxy - scale gravitational lenses as cosmic telescopes is very likely limited by the subtraction of the lens galaxy light .",
    "we estimate that this procedure introduces up to 0.1 magnitudes of systematic error into the source galaxy photometry . however , this is still smaller than the error introduced by the assumption of an isothermal density profile for the lens itself .    with this in mind",
    "we draw the following conclusions about the source behind :    * our photometry is robust enough to permit a reconstruction of the sed , and we find a stellar mass of ( ) . this is a factor of 5 smaller than the completeness limit of the gems disk galaxy analysis of @xcite , and also smaller than the least massive spheroid at this redshift studied by  @xcite . *",
    "the profile parameters of the source can be measured to high accuracy .",
    "we find an effective radius of ( ) ( @xmath62 arcsec with @xmath17% accuracy ) , and a index of ( ) in the ( @xmath16 rest - frame  b ) , and that these values change little over the rest - frame optical range . *",
    "this very small galaxy lies approximately 3-sigma below the local size - mass relation for disks .",

    "while the planned statistical analysis of a large sample of lensed galaxies will rely on the detailed understanding of the selection function , it is clear that the magnifying effect of gravitational lenses allows us to extend current size - mass studies to smaller sizes and lower masses than would otherwise be available , posing fresh challenges to models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
