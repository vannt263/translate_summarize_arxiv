    "it is noteworthy that there exist several heterometallic molecular - based compounds with a magnetic structure , which can be properly described as one - dimensional chain of alternating spin-@xmath1 and spin-@xmath2 metal ions . among the most common examples of the one - dimensional mixed spin-(1/2 , 1 ) chains one could mention    * cuni(edta).@xmath3h@xmath4o , @xcite * cuni(pbaoh)(h@xmath4o)@xmath5.nh@xmath4o , @xcite * cuni(pba)(d@xmath4o)@xmath5.@xmath6d@xmath4o , @xcite * pph@xmath7[ni(pn)@xmath4][fe(cn)@xmath9h@xmath4o , @xcite * \\{pr(bet)@xmath4(h@xmath4o)@xmath5fe(cn)@xmath10 } , @xcite * \\{ru(acac)@xmath4(cn)@xmath4}\\{ni(dmphen)(no@xmath5)}. @xcite    even though the vast majority of aforementioned polymeric compounds should be preferentially regarded as experimental representatives of the mixed - spin quantum heisenberg chain rather than the mixed - spin ising chain , it is the authors hope that our exact analytical results for the mixed spin-(1/2 , 1 ) ising chain may provide a deeper insight into several important vestiges of real physical behavior and explain some experimental results at least at a qualitative level . besides , one should also expect that the theoretical description based on the mixed spin-@xmath11 ising chain may be quite appropriate for those heterometallic coordination polymers , where at least one from both constituent magnetic ions possesses a rather high magnetic anisotropy .",
    "it should be stressed that the magnetic behavior of this type has been recently found in two heterometallic complexes containing highly anisotropic rare - earth ions @xcite .",

    "if the azfs parameter is selected close enough to the phase boundary between @xmath111 and @xmath115 , then , the additional second peak can be observed at low temperatures no matter whether @xmath111 or @xmath115 constitutes the ground state ( see the specific heat curves for @xmath144 and @xmath145 ) . however , the pronounced double - peak dependence of the specific heat gradually changes into the dependence with a single more or less symmetric maximum when considering more negative values of the azfs parameter far from the phase boundary between @xmath111 and @xmath115 ( see the thermal dependences for @xmath146 and @xmath147 ) .",
    "these observations would suggest that the low - temperature peak in the double - peak dependence of the zero - field specific heat arises from thermal excitations between the ground - state spin configuration and the relevant excited state with only slightly higher energy .",
    "the situation becomes even more intriguing when assuming the azfs parameter close enough to the phase boundary between @xmath111 and @xmath115 and applying the non - zero magnetic field .",
    "it is quite apparent from fig .",
    "[ sh](c ) that the thermal dependence of specific heat with a single more or less symmetric maximum can be recovered upon strengthening the external magnetic field ( see the curve for @xmath148 ) .",
    "however , one may also detect the very unusual triple - peak dependence of the heat capacity when applying the sufficiently small but non - zero longitudinal magnetic field as depicted in fig .",
    "[ sh](d ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the third peak is located in the low - temperature area and the emergence of this additional third peak can be explained as the zeeman s splitting of energy levels . in agreement with this argument , the third peak shifts linearly towards higher temperatures with increasing the strength of the magnetic field until it completely merges with the second low - temperature maximum .",
    "therefore , the triple - peak dependence of the heat capacity may be observed in a relatively weak magnetic fields only .",
    "next , let us examine the thermal dependence of the initial longitudinal susceptibility times temperature product @xmath149 as shown in fig .",
    "if the azfs parameter is selected so as to achieve @xmath111 in the ground state , then , @xmath149 product generally exhibits an exponential divergence when approaching zero temperature as depicted in fig .",
    "[ sus](a ) .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that @xmath149 monotonically decreases with increasing temperature for positive or small negative values of the azfs parameter .",
    "in addition , one may also detect a more striking non - monotonous temperature dependence of @xmath149 with a rather flat minimum when the azfs parameter is chosen sufficiently close but slightly above the ground - state boundary between @xmath111 and @xmath115 [ see for instance the curve @xmath150 in fig .",
    "[ sus](a ) ] .",
    "the emergence of the round minimum in the temperature dependence of @xmath149 product is a typical feature of the quantum ferrimagnets @xcite , because the monotonous decrease ( increase ) of @xmath149 product with increasing temperature indicates predominantly ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) character of excitations .",
    "the position of the round minimum can be thus regarded as a crossover point from the region with predominant ferromagnetic towards the region with predominant antiferromagnetic excitations .",
    "if the azfs parameter is strong enough to stabilize @xmath115 in the ground state [ see fig .",
    "[ sus](b ) ] , then , @xmath149 product increases monotonically with increasing temperature from its minimum initial value @xmath151 .",
    "this constant value evidently comes from the response of the spin-@xmath1 atoms with respect to the infinitesimal change of the magnetic field , because the spin-@xmath2 atoms occupy within the @xmath115 the non - magnetic spin state @xmath152 .",
    "it is also noteworthy that @xmath149 product converges to the constant value of @xmath153 in the limit of high temperatures @xmath154 regardless of whether @xmath111 or @xmath115 is being the ground state .",
    "this value agrees with the curie law for the mixed spin-(1/2,1 ) system , which consist of an equal number of independent spins-@xmath1 and spin-@xmath2 atoms .",
    "further , let us proceed to a discussion of temperature dependences of the initial transverse susceptibility times temperature product .",
    "it is worthwhile to recall that the rzfs parameter effectively introduces a magnetic anisotropy into both transverse ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) spatial components of the mixed - spin ising chain refined by the azfs and rzfs parameters and consequently , thermal variations of both spatial components of the initial transverse susceptibility ( @xmath155 and @xmath156 ) might significantly differ one from another .",
    "note furthermore that the positive value of the rzfs parameter corresponds to the situation when the @xmath97-axis is easier magnetization axis than the @xmath98-axis within the @xmath157-plane .",
    "first , let us compare thermal dependences of both initial transverse susceptibilities by considering the ground - state spin arrangement inherent to @xmath111 ( the left panel in fig .",
    "it is noteworthy that both spatial components of the initial transverse susceptibility exhibit very different temperature variations of the susceptibility times temperature product in this particular case .",
    "@xmath158 product initially decreases to its local minimum and then gradually increases with increasing temperature for positive or small negative values of the azfs parameter ( e.g. @xmath159 and @xmath160 ) , while it monotonously increases upon temperature increase for more negative values of the azfs parameter ( e.g. @xmath161 and @xmath162 ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath163 product always exhibits a non - monotonous temperature dependence with a single rounded maximum .",
    "another interesting observation is that @xmath163 is in general greater than the corresponding value of @xmath158 irrespective of temperature .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ 24 ] ) , the greater ( smaller ) value of @xmath163 ( @xmath158 ) relates to the greater ( smaller ) value of the @xmath164-component of the quadrupolar moment @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "the zero - temperature limits of the transverse susceptibility times temperature product are actually consistent with the asymptotic values of the quadrupolar moment obtained for @xmath111 from eq .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) in the zero - temperature limit @xmath167 @xmath168 this result is taken to mean that the @xmath97-axis is indeed easier magnetization axis than the @xmath98-axis in @xmath111 .",
    "it is worthy to notice , moreover , that the zero - temperature value of transverse spatial component of the quadrupolar moment ( [ qm ] ) has been confused with the zero - temperature value of the transverse susceptibility in the recent work of wu _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "it should be also mentioned that the difference in thermal dependences of both initial transverse susceptibilities becomes much less pronounced when considering the mixed spin-(1/2,1 ) ising chain in the another possible ground state @xmath115 ( the right panel in fig .",
    "the spin-1 atoms occupy within @xmath115 the non - magnetic spin state @xmath117 , which leads in turn to the equality of both transverse spatial components of the quadrupolar moment simultaneously achieving their maximum value @xmath169 in the ground state . owing to this fact ,",
    "both spatial components of the initial transverse susceptibility times temperature product start from its maximum value @xmath170 and they must generally decrease with increasing temperature due to the temperature - induced lowering of the quadrupolar moment . the only non - monotonous temperature dependence of the initial transverse susceptibility times temperature product can be found in @xmath163 vs. @xmath45 dependence if one considers the azfs parameter close enough to the phase boundary between @xmath115 and @xmath111 . in this special case , @xmath163 initially decreases rather rapidly to its local minimum , then it rises steadily to a shallow local maximum and finally , it repeatedly exhibits a gradual decline with increasing temperature .",
    "last but not least , let us examine the adiabatic demagnetization in connection with a possibility of observing the enhanced magnetocaloric effect that might be of technological relevance for magnetic refrigeration @xcite . to gain an insight into the adiabatic demagnetization , fig .",
    "[ en ] displays the temperature as a function of the external magnetic field under the adiabatic condition ( i.e. the constant entropy ) for one specific value of the rzfs parameter @xmath105 and four different values of the azfs anisotropy .",
    "note furthermore that the displayed dependences correspond to the low - temperature magnetization curves depicted in fig .",
    "[ mag ] .",
    "the observed temperature changes can easily be understood from a comparison of figs .",
    "[ fd ] and [ en ] . if the azfs parameter is so selected that @xmath111 constitutes the zero - field ground state [ fig .",
    "[ en](a ) ] , then , the spin system finally approaches a relatively low but non - zero temperature in the limit of vanishing external magnetic field .",
    "contrary to this , the temperature tends towards the absolute zero when a sufficiently strong ( negative ) value of the azfs parameter energetically stabilizes the disordered ground state @xmath115 in the zero - field limit @xmath171 [ figs .",
    "[ en](b)-(d ) ] . from this point of view , the mixed spin-(1/2,1 ) ising chain becomes a more efficient refrigerant if the azfs parameter drives the system into the disordered ground state @xmath115 .",
    "it is also worthy to notice that the character of magnetocaloric effect basically changes at transition fields , where one generally observes a rather fast cooling ( heating ) when approaching the relevant transition field from above ( below ) . besides",
    ", it is also quite apparent from fig .  [ en ]",
    "that the relatively fast and efficient cooling ( heating ) can be achieved only for the adiabatic processes with the constant entropy close enough to the value @xmath172 . under this circumstance",
    ", the temperature falls rather quickly to zero if the external magnetic field is approaching either the transition field between @xmath111 and @xmath118 , @xmath115 and @xmath118 , or it tends towards zero . on the other hand , the temperature reaches just some non - zero ( even if relatively small ) value if the external magnetic field approaches the transition field between @xmath111 and @xmath115 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the latter behavior can not be clearly seen within the displayed scale from fig .",
    "[ en ] and thus , it is separately demonstrated in fig .  [ me ] .",
    "it is quite evident from this figure that a relatively small dip ( minimum ) can be observed at the field - induced transition between @xmath111 and @xmath115 , whereas this local minimum in the magnetic field dependence of the temperature already disappears upon a small increase of the entropy of the adiabatic process .",
    "in this article , the mixed spin-(1/2,1 ) ising chain with the azfs and rzfs parameters in the applied longitudinal magnetic field has been exactly solved by combining the decoration - iteration transformation with the transfer - matrix method .",
    "exact results for phase diagrams , free energy , magnetization , quadrupolar moment , entropy , specific heat , longitudinal and transverse initial susceptibilities have been derived and discussed in detail .",
    "it has been shown that the rzfs parameter basically modifies the magnetic behavior of the investigated mixed - spin chain , since it is responsible for the quantum entanglement between two magnetic states @xmath173 of the spin-1 atoms .    among the most interesting findings to emerge from the present study one could mention an extraordinary diverse magnetization process , which may include the regions with the continuous change in the total magnetization , the intermediate magnetization plateau at one third of the saturation magnetization , as well as , one or two magnetization jumps accompanying the field - induced transitions between different phases .",
    "another interesting findings concern with an appearance of the round minimum in the temperature dependence of susceptibility times temperature data , the double - peak zero - field specific heat curves and the enhanced magnetocaloric effect in a vicinity of the field - induced phase transitions .",
    "it has been evidenced that the triple - peak temperature dependence of the specific heat may also be found when driving the system through the azfs and rzfs parameters close enough to a phase boundary between @xmath111 and @xmath115 and applying sufficiently small but non - zero longitudinal magnetic field .",
