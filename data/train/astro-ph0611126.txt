    "during the dark ages ( the time between recombination and the formation of the first stars ) , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is coupled to atoms of neutral hydrogen through spin - flip 21-cm transitions . due to the resonant nature of the interaction , neutral hydrogen at redshift @xmath1 imprints a signature at a wavelength of @xmath2 cm in the cmb .",
    "the brightness temperature of the cmb at radio wavelengths thus probes the three - dimensional neutral hydrogen distribution at @xmath3 .",

    "this is obtained by expanding the brightness temperature of the cosmic background up to second order in the underlying density fluctuations .",
    "related work has been presented by cooray ( 2005 ) who discussed the large - scale non - gaussianity generated during the era of reionization and by saiyad , bharadwaj & pandey ( 2006 ) who focussed on the post - reionization era ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "measuring the bispectrum of fluctuations in the 21-cm background will ultimately allow to quantify the degree of non - gaussianity ( ng ) of the dark matter density field at high - redshift .",
    "such a non - gaussianity has two possible origins : non - linearity due to the usual newtonian gravitational instability and non - gaussianity which is intrinsic in the mechanism generating the primordial seeds , i.e. arising during or immediately after inflation , as well as post - newtonian terms inherent in the solution of einstein s equations to second order ( bartolo , matarrese & riotto 2005 ) .",

    "moreover , the ratio of newtonian non - linear terms to intrinsical ng terms roughly scales like @xmath12 , so that ng signatures in the local universe are easily masked by the effects of gravitational instability . in this sense",

    "these figures are somewhat lower ( down to @xmath14 mhz ) at preferred sites located near the magnetic poles but , in general , the propagation properties of radio waves with frequencies @xmath15 mhz show extreme variations due to ionospheric scintillation ( e.g. kassim et al . 1993 ) .",

    "the total non - gaussian signal in the various configurations and for different values of @xmath7 is shown in the right panels of figure [ bispfig ] .",

    "the ratio between the two contributions is @xmath241 .",
    "this difference becomes much more severe at smaller angular scales .",
    "this happens because any primordial non - gaussianity in the gravitational potential is going to be shifted to larger scales when observed in the overdensity field as a direct consequence of the poisson equation .",
    "using second order perturbation theory , we have computed analytically and evaluated numerically the bispectrum of redshifted 21-cm fluctuations down to a few arcsecond angular scales ( @xmath242 ) .",
    "is the expected signal detectable by future radio experiments ? and can the data be used to test the gravitational instability scenario and quantify primordial non - gaussianity ?",
    "suppose we fit the observed bispectrum @xmath243 with a theoretical model by minimizing the objective function ^2=__1_2_3 where @xmath129 distinguishes the different contributions of non - linear gravity and primordial non - gaussianity and @xmath244 is a normalization constant ( i.e. , for a given set of cosmological parameters , @xmath245 and @xmath246 ) .",
    "if the amount of non - gaussianity is small , the cosmic variance of the bispectrum is given by the disconnected part of the six - point function of @xmath247 ( luo 1994 ) .",
    "the variance of @xmath248 is then calculated as ( e.g. spergel & goldberg 1999 ) ^2__1_2_3=b^2__1_2_3 - b__1_2_3 ^2 _ _",
    "1c__2 c__3__1_2_3 , where @xmath249 is equal to 1 , 2 or 6 when all the @xmath250-indices are different , two of them are the same or all of them are identical , respectively . here",
    "@xmath251 denotes the total angular power spectrum of the 21-cm background including the contribution of the detector noise .",

    "the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath257 for the @xmath129-component is given by ( ) _ i=. an order of magnitude estimation of this quantity as a function of the angular resolution @xmath250 can be obtained neglecting the covariance of the different components , thus writing @xmath258 .",
    "since the calculation of @xmath248 is expensive at high @xmath250 , we use the configurations in figure [ bispfig ] to estimate the total signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "our results are shown in figure [ snfig ] : an experiment with arcmin - scale resolution at @xmath238 would clearly detect the bispectrum induced by non - linear gravity with @xmath259 . on the other hand , for the signal from primordial non - gaussianity , @xmath260 .",
    "increasing the angular resolution by a factor of 10 would give @xmath261 .",
    "we consider here an ideal , full - sky experiment where the measurements are only limited by cosmic variance ( i.e. with no detector noise ) and where foreground signals can be perfectly subtracted .",
    "if only a fraction @xmath262 is surveyed , our signal - to - noise estimates should be depressed by a factor @xmath263 .",
    "a tomography of the neutral hydrogen distribution within the redshift range @xmath3 in slices of bandwidth @xmath264 mhz ( @xmath237 ) would provide nearly 150 21-cm maps . since the correlations between different redshift slices will be negligible for high multiples ( @xmath265 ) , this would increase the signal - to - noise ratios by a factor of @xmath4 .",
    "our results show that studies of the 21-cm bispectrum have the potential to test the gravitational instability scenario and the origin of primordial fluctuations .",
    "measurements of three - point statistics will also provide information on the cosmological parameters through the shape dependence of @xmath248 and the redshift evolution of the growth factors .",
    "low - frequency radio observations with high - angular resolution ( a few arcsec , corresponding to @xmath266 ) can detect primordial non - gaussianity with @xmath0 .",
    "one should however take into account that such high values of @xmath250 correspond to perturbation modes which have crossed the hubble radius during radiation dominance ; for such modes and for values of @xmath267 , a full second - order evaluation of the matter - transfer function would be needed to account for e.g. the mszros effect beyond the linear approximation , following bartolo , matarrese & riotto ( 2007 ) . on the scales of interest , weak lensing by the large - scale structure of the universe",
    "typically modifies the angular power spectrum of 21-cm fluctuations by only @xmath268 ( mandel & zaldarriaga 2006 ) .",
    "however , it also produces a non - vanishing disconnected four - point function which represents an additional source of noise for the bispectrum .",
    "potentially this could severely hamper the measurement of @xmath7 and a detailed study of the effect is required .",
    "major improvements in the measurement of @xmath7 could be achieved by constructing optimal estimators that weigh more those triangular configurations that correspond to particularly high signal - to - noise ratios .",
