    "decoherence - free(df ) states @xcite are useful for collective decoherence environment , even if there is a small symmetry breaking perturbation parameterized by @xmath0 in the order of o(@xmath0 ) ( @xmath1)@xcite . nowadays ,",
    "experiments for df states have been successful up to four qubits in photon system@xcite and in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr)@xcite",
    ". however , in solid - state qubits , it seems to be more difficult to realize the collective decoherence environment than in the case of optical or nmr qubits .",
    "this is because we could not prepare plenty of qubits with mathematically exact size , because the sizes of cooper - pair box@xcite or quantum dot ( qd)@xcite are less than hundreds of nm , and moreover , localized trap sites generated in the fabrication process disturb the collective decoherence environment .",
    "we theoretically describe the effect of non - uniform environment on df states of charge qubits composed of coupled qds , considering the measurement process , by using time - dependent density matrix ( dm ) equations .",
    "the charge distribution of the qubits changes the qpc current capacitively , resulting in detection and corruption of charged state ( backaction)@xcite .",
    "thus , measurement is a basic and important decoherence process that should be investigated in detail . in ref.@xcite , we discussed the robustness of df states under non - uniformity of qubits when they are detected by a simple structureless qpc detector .",
    "however , generally speaking , the solid - state qubit system is arranged compactly to avoid extra noises , and therefore , qubits have a tendency to be often affected by geometrical local structures such as electrodes or electrical wires .",
    "in addition , when there are local structures and large non - uniformities , it is possible that the four - qubit df states are less robust than non - df states . in such cases , for example , two qubit non - df state and",
    "the singlet state would be appropriate to constitute two logical states instead of using four - qubit df states , because defects and fault rates will increase as the number of qubits increases .    in this paper",
