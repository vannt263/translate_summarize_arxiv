    "it has been proven already three decades ago by elitzur that local ( gauge ) symmetries can not be broken spontaneously without invoking an explicitly asymmetric gauge fix.@xcite also , it has been argued recently that because the local gauge symmetry in superconductors can not be broken spontaneously , the order should be of a purely topological nature , and that the low energy properties of the superconducting state are determined solely by its topological structure.@xcite at first sight then , the claim that a superconductor possesses states related to spontaneous symmetry breaking that are at very low energy and within the superconducting energy gap , might come as a surprise .    however , it is well known that the superconducting ground state is characterized by a definite phase and a corresponding uncertainty in the number of cooper pairs . for a piece of superconducting material",
    "the realization of one specific phase is but one choice out of a manifold of equivalent possibilities .",
    "its phase having just one specific value therefore has to come about by spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "this symmetry breaking in the thermodynamic limit requires the existence of a so called thin spectrum of total phase states whose energies all collapse onto the groundstate energy in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "such a spontaneous symmetry breaking is _ not _ at variance with elitzur s theorem because the symmetry that is broken in a superconductor is a _",

    "the resulting superconducting state is still manifestly invariant under local gauge transformations .    to clearly illustrate these points we will first discuss the superconducting state of an array of josephson junctions . in this",

    "symmetry breaking in this superconductor turns out to be exactly analogous to the case of quantum crystals or magnetic systems.@xcite after that we will switch to a microscopic strong coupling model of superconductivity in which the role of gauge symmetry can be more clearly discussed .",
    "we will then use this model to describe a cooper - pair box qubit and show that the presence of the thin spectrum leads to a maximum coherence time @xmath5 of the qubit , which is of the order of milliseconds .",

    "the phase @xmath17 in this description can be thought of as the phase of the ginzburg - landau wavefunction for the superconducting island , or equivalently as the phase describing the perfectly ordered bcs state @xmath18.@xcite this phase is not measurable as such , but a difference in phase across a josephson junction causes a supercurrent @xmath19 , and therefore phase differences are measurable .",
    "the condition of measurability implies the gauge independence of these quantities , because a gauge transformation by definition can not alter the outcome of any experiment .",
    "the total phase is both unmeasurable and a gauge dependent quantity .",

    "we should add a symmetry breaking field to the collective hamiltonian .",
    "we can not simply add a term which involves the bare total phase @xmath24 , because that total phase is not a gauge independent , measurable quantity .",
    "instead we can look at the difference of phase between the josephson junction array and some given reference superconductor . in the end",
    "we will let the strength of the symmetry breaking field go to zero , or equivalently move the reference superconductor away to infinity .",
    "the hamiltonian including the symmetry breaking field thus becomes @xmath25 for small values of @xmath26 we can expand the cosine to quadratic order and then the hamiltonian reduces to a harmonic oscillator with well known solutions in terms of hermite polynomials , in exact analogy to the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum crystals and antiferromagnets . using these hermite polynomials , it is easy to show that indeed the josephson junction array can spontaneously break the rotational symmetry of its total phase by looking at its fluctuations in the limit of disappearing symmetry breaking field and infinite number of superconducting islands : @xmath27 clearly the fluctuations in the total phase disappear in the thermodynamic limit even if only an infinitesimal symmetry breaking field is present .",
    "the symmetry broken state that is formed in that limit has a well defined total phase , and must thus be in a superposition of many different total number states .",
    "these total number states were precisely the eigenstates of the collective hamiltonian  eq . , which we identified as being the thin spectrum of the josephson junction array .",
    "the symmetry broken hamiltonian also has a tower of low lying states that form a sort of dual thin spectrum which consists of all the total phase states necessary to build a state with a fixed total number of cooper pairs .",
    "notice that the thin spectrum states must be observable states , because the description of the collective dynamics in hamiltonian  eq . is still manifestly gauge invariant .",
    "this also implies that the symmetry breaking which we have just described is _ not _ the breaking of a local gauge symmetry .",
    "only the u(1 ) symmetry of the global total phase is spontaneously broken , and even then only in the sense that its fluctuations disappear in the thermodynamic limit , so that its value relative to that of some other , external superconductor will be fixed .    the fact that we needed to introduce an external superconductor as a _",

    "one can only assign a definite value to the position of the symmetry - broken crystal by measuring the distance of its center of mass to some external reference point ( which in that case can the observer himself ) .",
    "the position of the entire system of crystal and observer together is still completely arbitrary ( or at least unmeasurable for the observer ) , even in the symmetry - broken state .",
    "from the previous section it is clear that that the non - commutativity of number and phase naturally gives rise to the presence of a thin spectrum in a superconducting system .",
    "now we will examine how the superconducting orderparameter comes about by spontaneous symmetry breaking in the first place and how this is related to gauge symmetry .",
    "this relation was not visible in the context of a josephson junction array , because there we started out with islands that were postulated to be in a superconducting state .",
    "that way we could describe the whole system with an effective hamiltonian that only consisted of observables related to the macroscopic properties of the superconducting state .    for a more general description of superconductivity",
    "we start out with a microscopic hamiltonian for a single superconductor that incorporates the effects of the gauge field .",
    "the simplest such model is the extensively studied local pairing , negative-@xmath28 hubbard model@xcite @xmath29 here @xmath30 creates an electron on site @xmath8 , @xmath10 connects neighboring sites and @xmath9 counts the number of electrons .",
    "the reason to consider this local pairing model rather than for example the bcs model for superconductivity is the fact that this model is explicitly gauge invariant , while the bcs model is not . from the symmetry point of view , the models are the same : there is no phase transition in going from weak to strong coupling superconductivity , only a cross - over . if we parametrize the hopping in terms of a uniform amplitude and a bond dependent phase as @xmath31 , then minimal coupling allows us to identify the phase of the hopping parameter with the electromagnetic vector potential integrated along the bond under consideration , so that @xmath32 . thus the hamiltonian is invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath33 which immediately implies @xmath34.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we focus on the strong coupling limit where @xmath35 , so that we only need to consider the physics of the lower hubbard sector . on each site there",

    "doing so and then transforming back to the pseudospins @xmath95 and @xmath125 yields @xmath136 which is precisely the expected josephson current.@xcite notice that the occurrence of the josephson effect is a direct consequence of the phase symmetry breaking . starting from a symmetric , total - number ground state for the superconductors , the first order correction to the energy induced by the hopping term vanishes , so that there is no josephson current in that case .",
    "this observation raises the question what happens in practice when we try to bring two isolated pieces of superconductor closer together and allow them to weakly couple . assuming that the superconductors were so well isolated that their initial states were total number states , the first influence of the coupling will be to break the phase symmetry and cause the superconductors to acquire a well - defined phase _",
    "difference_. if two superconductors approach each other from infinity the actual value of the phase difference @xmath17 will be zero due to the energy gain  eq. and no josephson current of the type  eq .",
    "is present .",
    "however , a finite phase difference between the two pieces of superconductor can be induced by first applying a voltage difference between the two systems and then letting them approach . in the hamiltonian",
    "the voltage bias can be introduced into the hopping term by the peierls construction : @xmath137 where @xmath17 depends on the applied voltage .",
    "this form of the coupling term causes the symmetry to be broken such the phase difference between the superconductors is @xmath17 .",
    "if the bias is switch off again , a josephson current as in  eq . is induced .",
    "we would now like to apply the results of the previous sections to the description of quantum coherence . in analogy to the result for antiferromagnets,@xcite",
    "we expect the existence of the unobservable thin spectrum to give rise a maximum coherence time @xmath138 .",
    "let us define a qubit made of the eigenstates of the collective part of the local pairing superconductor .",
    "if temperature is sufficiently low ( i.e. @xmath139 ) then we can use the states @xmath140 and @xmath141 as the computational states of such a qubit .",
    "these states correspond to states with a different number of cooper pairs , and qubits of this type have been made experimentally in the form of cooper - pair boxes.@xcite in these cooper - pair boxes a superconducting island can be brought into a superposition of having @xmath142 and @xmath143 cooper - pairs present .",
    "superpositions of this type can reach coherence times of up to 500 ns.@xcite    in our local pairing description of the qubit , the initial state of the system must be a thermal mixture of thin spectrum states . after all",
    ", controlling these states experimentally is practically impossible .",
    "the initial state should then be brought into some superposition of the computational states @xmath140 and @xmath141 , so that it can be used in a quantum computation . because we know all eigenstates and eigenvalues of the hamiltonian exactly",

    "the thin spectrum states labeled with @xmath101 can not be observed or controlled experimentally , and they should therefore be traced out of the final density matrix . the remaining reduced density matrix then shows the coherence of only the superposition of @xmath89 states . the disappearance of the off - diagonal matrix element of the reduced density matrix serves as a measure of the resulting coherence time , and it can easily be checked that this coherence time is given by @xmath147 here @xmath86 signifies , as before , the average number of cooper pairs on the superconducting island in the groundstate .",
    "this coherence time is the maximum coherence time of a superconducting island , which is limited by the existence of a thin spectrum in the superconductor .",
    "just as in the cases of crystals and antiferromagnets , the details of the model ( e.g. @xmath41 or @xmath50 ) do not enter into the expression for the maximum coherence time , which thus looks like a universal timescale.@xcite    filling in the values for the constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 and taking @xmath148 and @xmath149 mk,@xcite we find a maximum coherence time for the experimentally realized cooper pair boxes of @xmath150 ms .",
    "clearly this timescale set by the presence of the thin spectrum states which are associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking , is much larger than the timescale that is the current limit to coherence of the cooper - pair boxes due to other environmental factors .",
    "however , it is well possible that the limit set by the thin states will come within the experimental reach in the near future , either because the isolation from external sources of decoherence will be developed further , or because the size of the cooper - pair box itself is reduced even more .",
    "in the previous sections we have shown that the superconductive groundstate is a state with a spontaneously broken u(1 ) symmetry . as a consequence the superconductor must have a thin spectrum of states that describe the collective excitations on top of the ground state . in the case of a local pairing model for superconductivity",
    "we have found an explicit expression for these thin states and we have shown how they can cause decoherence if we try to use a superconductive island as a qubit .",
    "it could be argued that the local pairing model is somewhat pathological , and not really representative for real - life superconductors , even though from the point of view of symmetry the model is equivalent to a weak coupling model ( because there is no phase transition which separates the two ) .",
    "we will therefore also work out the symmetry breaking and decoherence in a bcs description , and show that although the details of the picture change , the underlying physics is exactly equivalent , and in fact gives rise to the exact same conclusions regarding the thin spectrum and the timescale on which decoherence will set in .",
    "the draw - back of doing the calculation in a mean field bcs description is that it can not be done in a manifestly gauge invariant way , so that the role of the vector potential is obscured .    after creating cooper pairs ,",
    "we arrive in the standard bcs theory at the effective hamiltonian @xmath151 here we have adopted the convention to write @xmath152 as @xmath153 and @xmath154 as @xmath155 .",

    "@xmath28 is non - zero and attractive only in a shell around the fermi energy with a width of about the debije energy .",
    "it is easy to see that extensivity of the model in fact requires @xmath28 to be inversely proportional to the total number of electrons in the system .",
    "we will therefore redefine the pairing potential as @xmath157 , where @xmath1 denotes the total number of electrons in the @xmath153-space shell in which @xmath28 is non - zero .    by writing down the hamiltonian  eq .",
    "we have assumed that there is no external magnetic field and we have fixed the gauge to ensure that the electromagnetic vector potential vanishes everywhere .",

    "interpreted at face value , this hamiltonian describes pseudo spins on a lattice which has position - label @xmath153 . on this lattice",

    "@xmath162 ( where @xmath161 is the fermi wavenumber and @xmath163 the debije wavenumber ) we know that the pairing potential vanishes and @xmath156 is negative , so that all pseudospins in that region will point down , which corresponds to completely filled electronic states . in the region @xmath164 the pairing potential is zero as well , but here @xmath156 will be positive , causing all spins to point up , and all electronic states to be empty . in the shell of width @xmath163 around @xmath161",
    "a more interesting situation occurs .",
    "there @xmath12 is nonzero ( and approximately constant ) , while @xmath156 switches sign right at @xmath161 .",
    "the pseudo - spin structure that one would classically expect in that region is that of a magnetic domain wall : the pseudospins point up at one end of the region , then continuously fall over until they reach the @xmath38 plane exactly at @xmath161 , and then they continue on until they point down at the other end ( see figure  [ wall ] ) .",
    "electronically that structure corresponds to the bcs wavefunction @xmath165 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath166 however is invariant under rotations around the @xmath37-axis , and the exact groundstate will also obey this symmetry and have a completely delocalized projection of the pseudospins on the @xmath38 plane . to form a true domain wall , and thus the classical superconducting state , this u(1 ) symmetry",
    "will have to be spontaneously broken .",
    "because the symmetry breaking will only have an effect in the region around @xmath161 and because this region is fully decoupled from the other two regions of @xmath153-space , we will focus solely on that shell from now on , and define all sums over @xmath153 to run from @xmath167 to @xmath168 .",
    "the collective dynamics of the system will again be described by the singular points of the bogoliubov transformation which diagonalizes the hamiltonian .",

    "the latter can be thought of as a strong coupling approximation , in the sense that the hamiltonian  eq .",
    "will certainly be relevant in the region where @xmath173 .",
    "we will discuss different approximations for @xmath174 at the end of this section .",
    "the eigenstates of the collective hamiltonian are trivially found to be labeled by the total spin quantum number @xmath175 and its @xmath37-projection @xmath176 , while the corresponding energies are given by @xmath177 .",
    "the thin spectrum in this case is labeled by @xmath176 , and describes states with different total electron densities .",
    "the total spin excitations labeled by @xmath175 on the other hand , are gapped with an energy @xmath178 . to break the @xmath38-symmetry of @xmath77",
    "we can add a symmetry breaking field @xmath179 along for example the @xmath101-axis .",
    "after evaluating its matrix elements@xcite and taking the continuum limit , schrdinger s equation can once again be written as a harmonic oscillator equation @xmath180 with @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "the symmetry broken wavefunctions @xmath183 thus have energies @xmath184 in the ground state @xmath175 will be maximal ( i.e. @xmath185 ) , and then the term @xmath186 in the energy signals spontaneous symmetry breaking : in the thermodynamic limit the system can gain an infinite amount of energy by aligning with an infinitesimally small symmetry breaking field . the collective excitations that make up the ( dual ) thin spectrum on top of the symmetry broken ground state are labeled by @xmath101 .",
    "their energies are slightly influenced by the remaining collective quantum number @xmath175 .",
    "if we make a superposition of total spin states and trace away the unobservable thin spectrum , then this small shift in the thin spectrum s energy levels will cause the decoherence of the visible reduced density matrix , in a manner completely analogous to the one described in equation  eq .. the resulting maximum coherence time is given by @xmath187 where @xmath1 counts the number of states in the @xmath153 space volume of @xmath163 around @xmath161 , which is proportional to the number of cooper pairs in the superconducting condensate .",
    "so we find the same universal form for the expression of the coherence time set by spontaneous symmetry breaking as in the case of the local pairing model for superconductivity .",
    "as mentioned before , the collective hamiltonian  eq . can be seen as a strong coupling limit , because we require @xmath174 to be much smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "we can drive the system to a somewhat weaker coupling regime by reincluding an approximate form of @xmath188 into @xmath77 .",
    "one possible choice for such a term would be @xmath189 , which acts as a boundary condition , pulling the pseudospins down at the low @xmath153 boundary and up at the other end",
    ". a second choice could be the inclusion of the term @xmath190 where @xmath191 consists of all spins with @xmath192 and @xmath193 denotes spins above the fermi surface . in the latter case we should take care that @xmath194 can not be too great , for",
    "if it would dominate over @xmath12 everywhere , then it would transform the domain wall structure of the superconducting state into a trivial fermi - sphere structure again .",
    "it turns out that after some elaborate algebra both of the above cases give the exact same form for the thin spectrum and the maximum coherence time as the `` bare '' model @xmath77 did .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the non - commuting observables of number and phase in a superconductor give rise to spontaneous symmetry breaking and an associated thin spectrum .",
    "we have given explicit expressions for these thin spectrum states in an array of josephson junctions , in a tight - binding , negative-@xmath28 hubbard model , and in the bcs model for superconductivity .",
    "using the negative-@xmath28 hubbard model we have commented on the relation between spontaneous symmetry breaking and its associated thin spectrum , and the meissner effect , the anderson - higgs mechanism and the occurrence of josephson currents . for the occurrence of the meissner effect the phase symmetry actually need not be broken , but for the josephson effect it does .",
    "we have also given a description of a gedanken experiment in which the superconductor is to be used as a qubit , and we have shown that the presence of the thin spectrum states associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking will lead to decoherence of the qubit within the time @xmath195 , where @xmath1 counts the number of cooper pairs involved .",
    "this result was obtained in the negative-@xmath28 hubbard model as well as the bcs model .",
    "the timescale @xmath5 is universal in the sense that it does not depend on the underlying model parameters .",
    "its form coincides precisely with that of the decoherence time induced by thin spectrum dynamics in antiferromagnets and quantum crystals .",
    "the maximum coherence time that we found here for superconducting devices should apply directly to experimental realizations of the so called cooper pair box , and thus give a maximum coherence time of the order of milliseconds .",
    "the decoherence caused by the thin spectrum at the moment is much weaker than that caused by other sources , but it may well come within experimental reach in the near future . to apply the results of this paper to other types of superconducting qubits , such as for example superconducting flux qubits , one should adjust the models used here in order to also accommodate for the presence of an external magnetic flux and an associated supercurrent in the groundstate .",
    "because of its universal nature it is expected that the decoherence time set by the thin spectrum in these cases also will be given by the timescale @xmath195 .",
