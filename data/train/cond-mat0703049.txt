    "during the last decade , ultrafast light - induced magnetization dynamics has been a subject of many experimental studies , which have yielded results of interest from both the insight into the basic physical processes occurring in ferromagnets at short time - scales , and from the possible practical implications for ultrafast writing of magnetic memories .",
    "the seminal discovery @xcite of sub - picosecond demagnetization in ni has challenged the previously held belief that the fastest time - scale of magnetization dynamics is the spin - lattice relaxation time , which is of the order of at least tens of picoseconds.@xcite since then , such an ultrafast magnetization quenching process in transition metals has been confirmed by various time - resolved magneto - optical techinques @xcite as well al other experimental methods , such as magnetic second harmonic generation,@xcite spin - resolved photoemission,@xcite and thz light emission @xcite .",
    "recently , an analogous phenomenon of light - induced demagnetization , including a complete destruction of ferromagnetic order in less than a picosecond , has been observed in ( iii , mn)v ferromagnetic semiconductors.@xcite    apart from magnetization quenching , which is caused by absorption of light , there has recently been significant progress in nonthermal ( coherent ) light manipulation of magnetic order .",
    "@xcite coherent manipulation on the sub - picosecond time scale has been shown in antiferromagnetic @xcite and ferrimagnetic materials.@xcite theories of coherent manipulation of magnetization by strong off - resonant light have been put forth for ( iii , mn)v ferromagnetic semiconductors @xcite and for closely related undoped paramagnetic ( ii , mn)vi materials.@xcite in this paper we are interested in ultrafast demagnetization , which is an incoherent process involving strong excitation . the laser pulse heats up the carrier population , and we analyze the magnetization dynamics induced by such a hot gas of electrons or holes .",
    "ultrafast demagnetization experiments in transition metals were initially interpreted using a phenomenological three - temperature model.@xcite in this approach the system is divided into three reservoirs : carriers , lattice , and spins .",
    "excitation by light injects energy into the carrier system .",
    "each reservoir is described by its temperature , and phenomenological equations are written down for heat flow between each pair of reservoirs .",
    "physical underpinnings and time - scales of two of the couplings , carrier - lattice ( electron - phonon ) and spin - lattice interactions are known ( for the latter see ref .  ) . a new ingredient , a direct carrier - spin coupling has to be postulated in order to explain the ultrafast demagnetization .",
    "in addition to the lack of detailed microscopic understanding of such carrier - spin coupling , there are two major deficiencies of the three - temperature model .",
    "the first is that treating carriers and spins as separate entities might not be a good starting point for the transition - metal itinerant ferromagnets .",
    "if such an approach is possible , the nature of an effective separation into subsystems should be elucidated .",
    "the second shortcoming is the fact that only the energy transfer between reservoirs is considered . as the key phenomenon to be explained is the change of magnetization",
    ", a correct physical description should involve the mechanism by which the angular momentum ( spin and orbital ) is exchanged between the subsystems.@xcite recently,@xcite koopmans et .",
    "al .  proposed a simplified model of a transition - metal ferromagnet in which spinless electrons induce spin - flips in a magnetic subsystem separate from the electronic system .",
    "another proposed theory of demagnetization,@xcite in which the cooperative effect of a coherent laser field and the spin - orbit coupling is calculated , seems to be more suitable for the case of coherent manipulation of antiferromagnets.@xcite    a model of ferromagnetism ideally suited for investigation of magnetization quenching induced by excitation of carriers is the sp - d model . in this approach ,",
    "most of the macroscopic magnetization comes from the localized d - shell spins ( or f shells , in case of the rare earths ) , which are coupled by an exchange interaction to itinerant s or p carriers .",
    "this model was introduced independently by zener @xcite and by vonsovskii @xcite in order to describe the transition metals , but was abandoned when the above - mentioned lack of sharp separation into s carriers and d spins was understood .",
    "later , the s - d(f ) model was succesfully applied to magnetic semiconductors such as the chalcogenides of europium.@xcite recently , it has been again used in itinerant ferromagnets in order to analyze the situations in which an interplay between the transport and magnetic properties is critical .",
    "examples include spin - transfer torque @xcite and an enhancement of gilbert damping in a magnet due to pumping of spin currents into adjacent non - magnetic material.@xcite finally , and most importantly for us , the p - d model is used to describe the basic physics of ferromagnetism in ( iii , mn)v semiconductors,@xcite such as ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as or in@xmath0mn@xmath1as .",
    "ferromagnetic ( iii , mn)v semiconductors are created by doping a small ( @xmath25% ) molar fraction of mn into a iii - v semiconductor such as gaas or inas .",
    "the mn ions , which substitute the cations , are acceptors and their d shells can be treated as well - localized @xmath3 spins.@xcite hybridization between mn d orbitals and anion p states leads to a kinetic p - d exchange interaction @xcite , which couples localized d spins to spins of p holes in the valence band .",
    "these holes are a source of indirect mn - mn spin coupling . at large hole densities",
    "( typically @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 ) a mean - field theory of zener @xcite has been successful in describing many features of ferromagnetism in these materials .",
    "it correctly predicts the critical temperature @xmath8 , increasing trend in @xmath8 with the density of carriers , and magnetic anisotropies.@xcite    the strong correlation between the presence of the delocalized ( or at least weakly localized ) holes and ferromagnetic ordering of mn spins , has been firmly established experimentally .",
    "the optical induction of ferromagnetic transition ( through cw photoinjection of holes ) has been shown,@xcite and the critical temperature and the coercive field have been altered by changing the density of holes in inmnas by applying a gate voltage.@xcite most relevant for this article is the observation of the sub - picosecond light induced demagnetization in inmnas @xcite and gamnas.@xcite a complete quenching of ferromagnetic order was achieved in inmnas for pump fluences above 10 mj/@xmath9 .",
    "this should be contrasted with behavior in ni , where the demagnetization saturates at higher fluences while not reaching the complete demagnetization.@xcite since the carrier concentration is much lower in ferromagnetic semiconductors as compared to metals , their magnetization is more amenable to manipulation by external stimuli .",
    "these experiments led us to a preliminary investigation of the spin dynamics induced by strong incoherent excitation within the framework of the sp - d model,@xcite and to a proposal of the `` inverse overhauser effect '' as the physical basis of the observed phenomenon . in this scenario ,",
    "the rate of spin - flip scattering between the localized spins and the mobile carriers is enhanced by the non - equilibrium distribution of excited carriers .",
    "this triggers the transfer of angular momentum from the localized spin system to the carriers , leading to demagnetization of the localized spins . for this process to be sustained , the angular momentum transferred into the carriers system has to be efficiently dissipated into the lattice by spin - orbit interaction assisted scattering , and we have stressed that the expected short spin relaxation time of holes in ferromagnetic semiconductor is essential for the explanation of measured changes in magnetization .    in this article , we present a detailed theory of ultrafast demagnetization within the sp - d model .",
    "we concentrate on ferromagnetic semiconductors , specifically , we discuss photoexcitation processes specific to these materials , and we perform calculations using an effective hamiltonian @xcite model of the spin - split valence band .",
    "we assume that the indirect ( carrier - mediated ) exchange interaction between localized spins dominates over short - range antiferromagnetic d - d superexchange ( it has been argued@xcite that in the presence of holes the superexchange is suppressed ) .",
    "we also neglect the mn interstitials@xcite which can form antiferromagnetically coupled pairs with nearby substitutional mn spins,@xcite as we are only interested in mn spins which participate in ferromagnetic order .",
    "furthermore we work in the regime of strong carrier excitation , in which the carrier mediated mn - mn correlations beyond the mean - field level are averaged out .",
    "the localized spins flip independently in the common mean field due to the average carrier spin .",
    "we derive the rate equations for their dynamics due to spin - flip scattering with the carriers spins .",
    "the transition rates depend on the instantaneous state of the carrier system at a given time .",
    "this derivation generalizes to the non - stationary case the theory from ref .",
    ", where the heating of mn spins by electrons excited by cw light was considered in a ( ii , mn)vi based quantum well . apart from the localized spin dynamics , we consider the energy and spin relaxation of carriers by means of phenomenological equations .",
    "the energy relaxation time of the carriers sets an upper bound for the time - scale of the ultrafast demagnetization process .",
    "if the spin relaxation rate of carriers is smaller than the rate at which the angular momentum is injected into the carrier system by sp - d scattering , the demagnetization becomes suppressed .",
    "below we show that this `` spin bottleneck '' effect does not affect qualitatively the results in p - type ( iii , mn)v semiconductors .",
    "the general results of this article are directly applicable to any system described by analogous s(p)-d(f ) model . however ,",
    "when the non - carrier - mediated d - d exchange coupling is strong ( e.g. in the europium chalcogenides @xcite ) , the starting point of the calculation should not be the interaction of a single spin with the carriers ( which is our approach here ) , but the enhancement of the carrier - magnon scattering . a similar treatment should be applied to a recent measurement@xcite of the ultrafast demagnetization in gamnas excited with the pump fluence 3 orders of magnitude smaller than in ref .  .",
    "in this case , our assumption of complete obliteration of the carrier - mediated exchange coupling by excitation of carriers might not hold , and spin - wave modes of coupled mn spins should be the starting point of the calculation .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section [ sec : sp - d ] we introduce the sp - d model .",
    "section [ sec : excitation ] contains a discussion of the photoexcitation process , which is followed in section [ sec : bath ] by the description of the model of the carrier bath heated up by absorption of light .",
    "section [ sec : derivation ] contains the formalism and the derivations of equations governing the dynamics of localized spins interacting with hot itinerant spins . in section [ sec:1band ]",
    "we calculate the process of ultrafast demagnetization using a simplified band structure ( a single spin - split band ) , introduce the equations governing the carrier dynamics , and discuss how the energy and spin relaxation of carriers influences the demagnetization process .",
    "complications introduced by valence band - structure of a ferromagnetic semiconductor are discussed in section [ sec : valence ] , where we use a 6 band luttinger hamiltonian to calculate the hole - mn spin - flip transition rate .",
    "finally , we discuss the connection to the experiments in section [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "we use a hamiltonian consisting of the single - particle carrier part @xmath10 , localized spin part @xmath11 and the sp - d coupling @xmath12 : @xmath13 we do not explicitly consider the carrier - carrier interaction , carrier - phonon interaction , and the lattice dynamics .",
    "however , these interactions are included phenomenologically in our treatment of the carrier bath ( section [ sec : bath ] ) .",
    "the carrier part of the hamiltonian is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the band index , @xmath16 is the wave - vector , and @xmath17 is the energy . in the case of ( iii , mn)v semiconductors , the valence band structure near the @xmath18 point can be obtained from a @xmath19 model , such as 6@xmath206 luttinger hamiltonian commonly used in these systems.@xcite although the ferromagnetic semiconductors are known to be heavily disordered , we have neglected the disorder potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hc ] ) .",
    "if the disorder can be treated perturbatively , then its influence on the treatment below is not expected to be strong . as we are working in the regime of very strong excitation of carriers ,",
    "more subtle features of bands will be averaged out . on the other hand , if the effects of disorder are non - perturbative ( e.g. the holes are in an impurity band rather than in the host valence band , as it was recently suggested in ref .  ) , a new energy dispersion ( e.g. a single weakly dispersive band ) should be included introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hc ] ) .",
    "the localized spin hamiltonian @xmath11 includes zeeman coupling to the external magnetic field . in the ferromagnetic phase ,",
    "the splitting of the localized spin s due to exchange interaction with carriers exceeds the typical zeeman splitting , and the only role of zeeman term is to choose the direction of the magnetization .",
    "we disregard possible s - s exchange coupling by mechanisms other@xcite than indirect carrier - mediated exchange .",
    "finally , the exchange coupling is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the spin operator of localized spin at @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the carrier spin operator and @xmath25 is the exchange constant . in the literature on diluted magnetic semiconductors ,",
    "the @xmath25 parameter is called @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the conduction and valence band electrons , respectively.@xcite the typical values in ( iii , mn)v materials are @xmath26@xmath5@xmath28 and @xmath27@xmath5@xmath29 mev@xmath30nm@xmath31 .",
    "the exchange energy @xmath32 per unit cell is @xmath32@xmath33@xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the density of the cations .",
    "accordingly , @xmath36@xmath5@xmath37 ev and @xmath38@xmath5@xmath39 ev .    for a single band ,",
    "the sum over @xmath15 states is simplified to @xmath40 where the scalar product of spin operators can be expressed using spin ladder operators as : @xmath41 and the explicit form of carrier spin operators is @xmath42 @xmath43    the magnetization ( average localized spin ) is in the @xmath44 direction , and we treat the sp - d hamiltonian in a mean - field approximation .",
    "the mean - field felt by the carriers is obtained by performing the simplest virtual crystal disorder averaging of localized spins positions : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the density of localized spins and @xmath47 is the average localized spin .",
    "the energy of the carrier spin splitting is defined as @xmath48 the typical value of @xmath49 in gamnas and inmnas with the highest critical temperatures is about @xmath50 ev . by averaging eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcs ] ) with respect to the carriers we arrive at @xmath51 where the energy splitting of different @xmath52 levels of a localized spin is @xmath53 with @xmath54 the carrier density and @xmath55 the average carrier spin . the typical magnitude of @xmath56 in ( iii , mn)v materials is of the order of 1 mev . in the mean - field theory of ferromagnetism",
    "@xcite only the two averaged fields @xmath47 and @xmath55 are taken into account , and the free energy of their interaction is minimized .      to construct a model of the excited carrier bath ,",
    "it is helpful to first analyze qualitatively the process of carrier photoexcitation in ferromagnetic semiconductors .",
    "the cw ( magneto)optical spectra of gamnas are qualitatively different from the ones in pure gaas , as they show very strong effects of disorder.@xcite in gamnas , there is no gap in the absorption , which is at least of the order of @xmath57 @xmath58 for all energies.@xcite the origin of strong absorption inside the host gap is a matter of controversy ( see figure [ fig : gamnas_bandstructure ] ) . it has been proposed that the additional optical transitions are between the valence band and the dispersionless levels ( located about @xmath59 e@xmath60 above the valence band ) originating from as antisites or mn interstitials.@xcite transitions terminating inside the mn derived impurity band @xmath2@xmath50 ev above the valence band edge have also been suggested.@xcite    in addition , the role of the inter - valence band transitions is increased in the disordered material , in which the @xmath16-selection rule is relaxed . as a result ,",
    "the absorption of light with energy smaller than the bandgap of the host material leads to a strong excitation in the valence band , which occurs due to inter - valence transitions and possible transitions from below the fermi energy into the localized states within the gap .",
    "the initial distribution of photoholes is expected to be very broad , determined only by energy conservation ( not by @xmath16-selection ) .",
    "we use the broadness of the distribution of the carriers after the excitation and their total number as free parameters of the theory . some flexibility in the used values of total hole density immediately after the excitation @xmath4 is also justified by the fact that the initial densities @xmath61 are usually known with only an order of magnitude accuracy .",
    "we use an energy width of hole distribution after excitation of the order of @xmath50 ev , a value comparable to the exchange splitting of the valence band .",
    "in section [ sec : comparison ] we use the experimental data to argue that the above energy scale is sensible .     model with mean - field sp - d exchange interaction",
    "( @xmath62@xmath33@xmath63 ev ) .",
    "the dotted lines denote the possible positions of midgap energy levels of different origins . in the model without an impurity band , the fermi energy is typically around @xmath64 ev for hole density @xmath4@xmath2@xmath6 @xmath7 . , width=302 ]    the optical experiments in inmnas are limited to samples with very small mn concentrations @xcite or energies above the fundamental bandgap.@xcite the role of various defects has not been investigated in inmnas as closely as in , but the observed@xcite ultrafast electron trapping time suggests that inmnas does have a large concentration of midgap defects characteristic of low - temperature grown iii - v semiconductors .",
    "we can also use the results of this article to argue for the presence of strong transitions involving the valence band states and states not in the conduction band , on the ground that the number of states available in the conduction band is far too small to explain the demagnetization results .",
    "this picture of photoexcitation is confirmed by the ultrafast demagnetization measurements @xcite in gamnas excited by @xmath65 ev pump , far below @xmath66 ev bandgap of gaas .",
    "the results are similar to the ones observed @xcite in inmnas ( bandgap of @xmath67 ev ) excited by the same pump beam , showing that excitation into the conduction band plays a minor role in the demagnetization process .",
    "according to the discussion in the previous section , immediately after the photoexcitation the distribution of carriers is very broad .",
    "we will approximate it by a thermal distribution described by the electronic ( carrier ) temperature @xmath68 . using the experimental data from ref .",
    "we estimate the initial @xmath68 to be of the order of 1000 k ( for details see section [ sec : comparison ] ) .",
    "the interaction between the carriers and the localized spins produces a mean - field term ( eq .  ( [ eq : cmf ] ) ) and a secondary term corresponding to simultaneous flips of the itinerant and localized spins . the latter causes exchange of angular momentum between the excited carriers and the localized spin system . due to the spherical symmetry of the sp - d hamiltonian , the sp - d interaction alone conserves the total spin , and it can only move the spin polarization from one system to another .",
    "the mechanism of this transfer of spin is described in detail in the next section .",
    "now we concentrate on the features of the carrier bath which are specific to the case at hand : the possibility of dynamic spin polarization and the energy relaxation of carriers .",
    "the spin transferred into the carrier system is not conserved due to the spin - orbit interaction . in its presence the scattering within the electronic system is accompanied by spin relaxation @xcite ( ultimately into the lattice ) .",
    "however , the spin relaxation occurs on a finite time - scale @xmath69 .",
    "if the rate at which the carriers relax their spins is smaller than the rate at which angular momentum is injected into the carrier population , there is a dynamic spin polarization of the carriers . in this case",
    "the average carrier spin deviates from the mean - field value determined by @xmath49 splitting of the bands . in the case",
    "when the carriers occupy a single spin - split band , there is a simple way of introducing the dynamic polarization into our formalism ( the case of multiple bands strongly coupled by spin - orbit interaction is considered in section [ sec : valence ] ) .",
    "we assume that populations for both spin directions are described by fermi - dirac distributions with the common temperature @xmath68 but different quasi - chemical potentials @xmath70 ( spin @xmath71@xmath33@xmath72,@xmath73 ) .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that we coarse - grain the dynamics on a time - scale larger than the time in which the energy is redistributed within the carrier system ( by carrier - carrier scattering ) , and we explicitly consider only the slower processes : spin relaxation of carriers and energy transfer into the lattice .",
    "it is similar to the situation encountered in semiconductor lasers , where the processes of thermalization of electrons and holes separately occur faster than the recombination , and the resulting globally out - of - equilibrium situation can be described by using the quasi - equilibrium form of the carrier distribution , with different quasi - chemical potentials for electrons and holes .    as we discuss in detail in the following sections , dynamic polarization of carriers",
    "affects the spin - flip scattering rate .",
    "this is a back - action effect of the s system on the carrier system : demagnetization of localized spins causes the dynamic polarization of carriers , which in turn influences the rate of transfer of angular momentum between the systems .",
    "additionally , as the average s spin changes in time , so does the @xmath49 splitting of the carrier bands .",
    "apart from the dynamic polarization effects , we also have to take into account that the carriers are not in thermal equlibrium with the lattice , and in the first picoseconds after the photoexcitation they are described by a different temperature than the lattice .",
    "we model the carrier - phonon interaction ( leading to the cooling of carriers ) and carrier - carrier scattering ( maintaining the thermal distribution ) phenomenologically . in metals ,",
    "the electron - phonon energy relaxation time is a couple hundreds of femtoseconds.@xcite in semiconductors , the regime of such strong excitation as used in ref .",
    "to demagnetize inmnas has not been investigated in detail .",
    "theoretical calculations of energy relaxation of holes deep in the valence band indicate that emission of optical phonons is very efficient for these states.@xcite calculated emission of 7 phonons during a picosecond should correspond to significant cooling of the carriers .",
    "nave extrapolation of energy - loss curves @xcite to hole temperatures of @xmath2@xmath74k also gives a sub - picosecond energy relaxation time . in the following",
    ", we will use an energy relaxation time @xmath75 of the order of picosecond , and assume @xmath76 .",
    "more generally , the carrier and lattice temperatures could be solved for using a two - temperature model.@xcite however , in the case of ( iii , mn)v semiconductors the rise in lattice temperature due to heat transfer from the carriers described by such @xmath68 is quite small , so that the final common temperature of carriers and the lattice is less than 100 k. as we discuss in detail further on , such a temperature corresponds to very slow demagnetization dynamics , and for the purpose of calculating the ultrafast process , we can then assume that the carrier temperature simply decays towards zero .    in the following , all the averages with respect to carrier degrees of freedom will be taken using a density matrix of non - interacting electrons @xmath77 , which is not necessarily of the equilibrium form , but remains diagonal in the basis of carrier hamiltonian s eigenstates @xmath78@xmath33@xmath79 .",
    "these averages are denoted as @xmath80@xmath81@xmath82 , and they are given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the average occupation of @xmath26 state . in a single - band model ,",

    "@xmath87 is a fermi - dirac function at temperature @xmath68 with spin - dependent chemical potential @xmath70 .",
    "the framework of the sp - d model allows for clear separation of carrier ( c ) and localized spin ( s ) systems .",
    "the mean - field parts of their mutual interaction are given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cmf ] ) and ( [ eq : smf ] ) .",
    "the spin - splitting @xmath49 of the carriers band is proportional to the instantaneous @xmath47 , and the splitting of localized spins , @xmath56 , changes with the average carrier spin @xmath55 .",
    "we assume that any correlation between localized spins beyond the mean - field zener approach is obliterated by the strong scattering of excited carriers .",
    "each localized spin feels the dynamics of the other spins only through their average value , which influences the state of the carrier system ( its spin splitting @xmath49 ) .",
    "essentially , we consider an ensemble of paramagnetic s spins interacting with a bath , the properties of which depend on the average s. the ferromagnetism enters only as an initial condition : the s system is polarized at @xmath88@xmath33@xmath89 .",
    "below we derive the equations for the dynamics of the average s spin due to the interaction with the carrier bath , the state of which depends on the average s.    the hamiltonian of the localized s spins and the carriers system is written as @xmath90 where @xmath10 is the carrier band hamiltonian ( eq .",

    "( [ eq : cmf ] ) , @xmath56 is the mean - field localized spin splitting defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) , and the spin - flip term of @xmath92-th localized spin @xmath93 comes from part of sp - d interaction which is off - diagonal in @xmath94 basis .",
    "we write it in the following way : @xmath95 where @xmath96 are proportional to the ladder operators of carrier spin . in the general case of multiple bands ( as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcs ] ) ) we have @xmath97 whereas for a single band we have @xmath98    now we follow a standard way of deriving the master equation for the density matrix of the localized spin system interacting with a carrier bath ( see e.g.  ref .  ) .",
    "the total density matrix of the system is assumed to factorize into the carrier and the localized spin density operators : @xmath99 and the liouville equation for time - dependence of @xmath100 is turned into an equation for @xmath101 by tracing out the carrier degrees of freedom .",
    "however , unlike in standard treatment,@xcite the state of the carrier bath changes in time , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the usual derivation of the master equation implies coarse - graining of the system dynamics on time - scale @xmath102 longer than the correlation time of the bath , @xmath103 .",
    "this is the condition on which the markov approximation rests . for the gas of carriers described by the effective temperature @xmath104@xmath5@xmath50 ev",
    ", we can expect this time to be of the order of a few femtoseconds .",
    "let us define a time - scale @xmath105 in which changes in the carriers density matrix @xmath106 occur .",
    "the contributions to the evolution of @xmath106 are as follows .",
    "the carrier temperature changes appreciably during energy relaxation time @xmath75@xmath2@xmath107 ps . the spin splitting of the band @xmath108 is proportional to the average localized spin @xmath109 , which we expect to decrease during a characteristic demagnetization time @xmath110 .",
    "the build - up of the dynamic spin polarization of the carriers is determined by two processes : transfer of spin from the s system occurring during the aforementioned time @xmath110 and the spin relaxation of carriers characterized by time @xmath69 ( for very short @xmath69 , there is no dynamical polarization ) .",
    "now , we will assume that all these result in the time @xmath105 much larger than the bath correlation time @xmath103 , so that we can choose our coarse - graining step @xmath49 fulfilling the condition : @xmath111 in such a case , at each coarse - grained time - step @xmath112 we can derive a master equation with carriers described by @xmath113 treated as approximately constant during @xmath102 . in this way we can use the markov approximation locally in time , having separated the `` macroscopic '' back - action of the localized spin system on the bath , which occurs on a longer time - scale .",

    "the hole concentration before the excitation is about @xmath242 @xmath7 , estimated from critical temperature of @xmath177 k and magnetization measurements.@xcite after the excitation the total number of holes is larger but , because the initial @xmath4 is not certain , we will simply use a value of total @xmath4@xmath33@xmath242 @xmath7 .",
    "the measured sample was a 25 nm thick layer of inmnas grown on gasb .",
    "for such thickness , the confinement leads to formation of hole subbands , with typical energy spacing between them of the order of 10 mev .",
    "this confinement energy is much less than the disorder broadening and the thermal spread of photoexcited carriers ( both @xmath2@xmath50 ev ) , so that our calculation of spin - flip transition rates using the bulk band - structure should be a good approximation . in the previous section",
    ", we have seen that for such @xmath4@xmath33@xmath242 @xmath7 the sub - picosecond drop in magnetization is about @xmath28% .",
    "experimentally a @xmath177% drop in kerr signal was observed within @xmath2@xmath243 fs after the pump pulse .",
    "the step - like character of the magnetization drop is not reproduced by our theory , which predicts a smoother demagnetization .",
    "however , the carrier - induced artifacts ( termed `` dichroic bleaching '' in ref .  ) obscuring the magnetization dependence of the magnetooptical signal are possible at very short time - scale .",
    "the magnitude of the total demagnetization is in qualitative agreement with our calculations .    for pump fluence of 10 mj/@xmath9 , for which a complete quenching of ferromagnetic order is observed ,",
    "the role of multi - photon absorption processes becomes pronounced , and photocarriers are created in a very large region of the brillouin zone ( as in experiments from ref .  , where a pump with @xmath244@xmath33@xmath245 ev was used in gamnas ) .",
    "our @xmath201 model with `` rigid '' spin splitting ( i.e.  @xmath16-independent exchange constant ) is not applicable far away from the @xmath18 point .",
    "also , for very high excitation the assumption of quasi - thermal distribution of holes can fail .    in gamnas",
    "the experiments show a similar behavior @xcite after 1 picosecond , with @xmath246% magnetization drop for fluence of @xmath2@xmath247 mj/@xmath9 .",
    "this value is very close to the predictions of our theory for @xmath4@xmath33@xmath225 @xmath7 .",
    "for the same fluence inmnas was already nearly completely demagnetized .",
    "although our theory predicts larger demagnetization in gamnas than in inmnas , in order to make meaningful comparisons one has to achieve comparable excitation parameters ( total @xmath4 and @xmath68 after the pulse ) . also , the efficiency of excitation of holes can be different in the two materials .",
    "we have presented an investigation of the ultrafast demagnetization induced by an incoherent light excitation in a system described by the sp - d model .",
    "the physical picture of demagnetization is very transparent , with sp - d interaction providing a mechanism of spin transfer from the localized spins into the system of excited carriers .",
    "this process is closely related to effects known from systems of electronic and nuclear spins coupled by hyperfine contact interaction , and thus we have termed it the inverse overhauser effect .",
    "the demagnetization basically comes from very fast @xmath184 relaxation of the localized spins due to sp - d interaction with the hot carriers spins . in a simple one - band model",
    "the rate of spin flip scattering of itinerant and localized spins is proportional to the square of the sp - d exchange constant , the product of electronic densities of states at fermi energy for two spin directions , and the temperature of the carriers . due to the carrier temperature dependence",
    "the rapid demagnetization can occur only for a time of the order of energy relaxation time @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the sub - picosecond time scale of the demagnetization process simply comes from the characteristic time of carrier - phonon interaction .",
    "the total magnitude of demagnetization during the @xmath75 time depends only on the spin - flip scattering efficiency if the carrier system is a good spin sink , i.e. the carrier spin relaxation time @xmath69 is shorter than the time - scale on which the dynamic spin polarization of carriers builds up .",
    "a long @xmath69 leads to spin bottleneck that suppresses the demagnetization .",
    "this general theory can be used as an admittedly rough model for demagnetization process in transition metals ( treated within s - d model ) , as it captures all the crucial aspects of the problem .",
    "@xcite    a large part of the discussion was aimed at the specific cases of ( iii , mn)v semiconductors . there , a non - trivial band structure with spin - orbit interaction has to be taken into account . we have performed the calculations of spin - flip transition rate using an effective @xmath248@xmath30@xmath249 hamiltonian approach .",
    "an approximate calculation of the effects of dynamical spin polarization of holes has been used to argue that the holes can be treated as a perfect sink for the angular momentum transferred from the localized spins . a qualitative agreement with demagnetization experiments in these materials",
    "was obtained : the theory shows that the magnetization can drop by @xmath2@xmath28% within the energy relaxation time of the holes . more theoretical and experimental work on electronic and optical properties of ( iii",
    ", mn)vs will be necessary in order to better reconcile experiments and theory .",
