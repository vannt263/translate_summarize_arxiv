    "scale - invariance is ubiquitous in physics , appearing in statistical mechanics and phase transitions , quantum field theories near fixed point , and the much - lauded ads / cft correspondence @xcite . in this paper , we explore dynamics of a simple classical conformal field theory in a flat spacetime , consisting of a single real - valued scalar field with action @xmath1 \\sqrt{-g}\\ , d^4 x\\ ] ] and the quartic potential with the `` wrong '' sign @xmath2 corresponding to attractive self - interaction .",
    "although potential is unbounded from below and the theory is unstable , the classical vacuum @xmath3 is infinitely long - lived , and the corresponding quantum theory is renormalizable @xcite .",
    "in fact , this model is in some sense better off than familiar gravity , which is also attractive , also has unbounded negative binding energy , singularities appearing in evolution of a regular initial data , but is non - renormalizable on top .",
    "quantum field theory with @xmath4 interaction has been extensively studied , with renormalization group calculated perturbatively to fifth loop long time ago @xcite .",
    "recently , dvali _ et .  al .",
    "_ @xcite argued that the theory ( [ eq : action],[eq : v ] ) captures some features of quantum phenomena , asymptotic freedom and dimensional transmutation , at a classical level .",
    "this would be pretty interesting , because in classical field theory we have direct access to fully non - perturbative and non - linear solutions , which are readily found using numerical methods .",
    "models of the type ( [ eq : v ] ) might also have cosmological applications , where conformal symmetry can be used to generate scale - invariant primordial fluctuations @xcite .    with this in mind",
    ", it would seem that the theory ( [ eq : v ] ) warrants some further investigation .",
    "seeming simplicity of the model is deceptive , and there are some rather non - trivial things about it , which is what i report here .",
    "evolution of the classical scalar field ( [ eq : action ] ) with potential ( [ eq : v ] ) is governed by the wave equation @xmath5 conformal symmetry can be used to make variables dimensionless by rescaling to an arbitrary length scale @xmath6 .",
    "in addition coupling @xmath7 can be rescaled to unity by @xmath8 as long as it does not vanish , which is what we will do in most calculations below .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : collapse ] , i explore the eventual fate of a localized wavepacket and find that there is dynamical critical behavior in this theory , similar to the critical gravitational collapse @xcite . in section  [ sec : static ] , i derive static spherically symmetric solutions , which turn out to have regular localized soliton - like states that are unstable and probably correspond to critical solutions of the dynamical collapse . as the energy of these is infinite due to slowly decaying tails ,",
    "i construct static non - linear dipole configurations in section  [ sec : dipole ] , and show that their energy is finite .",
    "i conclude with some speculations in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finer points of classical beta function asymptotics and behavior of irregular static solutions are hidden in appendix  [ sec : running ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     we will look for the static dipole solutions by spectral decomposition in bispherical coordinate system , which is adapted to the symmetries of the solution we seek @xcite .",
    "bispherical coordinates are obtained by axial rotation of a bipolar reference frame , which in turn is a conformal transformation of a @xmath9-plane by a factor @xmath10 which leaves coordinate grid orthogonal , but shrinks infinity @xmath11 to two points  the location of dipole foci  as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bipolar ] . explicit transformation back to cartesian coordinates reads @xmath12 while the flat space metric in bispherical coordinates is @xmath13 bispherical coordinate system allows separation of variables for laplace equation , so we will decompose the solution we seek onto a countable set of basis functions @xmath14 formed by a tensor product of a radial basis @xmath15 and the usual spherical harmonics @xmath16 @xmath17 with a little work , one can show that the variables in laplace equation indeed separate , with @xmath18 y_{\\ell m}.\\ ] ] the natural choice for radial basis in dipole symmetry is @xmath19 which makes the laplace operator diagonal @xmath20 f_{k \\ell m},\\ ] ] and the free field dipole solution formed by a pair of point charges @xmath21 and @xmath22 simply @xmath23 however , as exponentials are rapidly growing functions as @xmath24 , the convergence rate for coefficients of expansion in this basis is abysmal .",
    "instead , we notice that basis functions ( [ eq : basis : rk ] ) are simply odd power polynomials in @xmath25 , and recombine the basis set into chebyshev polynomials of argument rescaled inside a bounded domain @xmath26 @xmath27 the simplest way to evaluate the new radial basis is by using trigonometric representation @xmath28 while the second derivative of @xmath29 with respect to @xmath30 which enters the laplace operator can be evaluated as @xmath31 evaluated at a set of points @xmath32 , laplacian and field value operators ( [ eq : decomp],[eq : laplacian ] ) are just big matrices acting on a vector of spectral coefficients @xmath33 drawn from a linear space spanned by values of composite index @xmath34 in ( [ eq : decomp ] ) @xmath35 truncating the spectral expansion and selecting an appropriate collocation grid to evaluate the residuals , linear elliptical partial differential equation @xmath36 turns into a linear algebra problem @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "an optimal grid is determined by the basis choice , which we take to be the gauss - lobatto grids for chebyshev and legendre polynomials in radial and angular directions , respectively @xmath38 direct inversion of the resulting linear algebra problem solves linear elliptic pde to arbitrary precision @xcite . alas ,",
    "the same can not be said even for semi - linear pde .",
    "it is well known in computational mathematics that elliptic semi - linear pdes like @xmath39 admit infinitely many distinct solutions even in compact domains , even with trivial boundary conditions @xcite . without any additional constraints ,",
    "positions and amplitude of the solitonic waves will be undetermined . to break this degeneracy",
    ", we impose explicit dirichlet conditions on @xmath40 at arbitrary excision boundary @xmath41 close to focal points , and look for the solution outside . as all of the basis functions decay as @xmath42 ,",
    "no additional boundary conditions arise at spatial infinity ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) .",
    "then , starting with some initial guess , one tries to zero the residual @xmath45 by an iterative scheme .",
    "as one soon finds out , newton - kantarovich iteration obtained by linearizing the above equation @xmath46 fails to converge if non - linearity is sufficiently strong ( and it is for oscillatory solutions we seek ) .",
    "so one is reduced to crawling down the direction of steepest descent in levenberg - marquardt fashion @xmath47 and hoping for the best . here",
    "tilde denotes the usual levenberg - marquardt regularization operator scaling the diagonal elements of a matrix by a factor of @xmath48 , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the preconditioned newton iteration matrices @xmath51 preconditioning by @xmath52 reflects the volume factors in the residual squared cost function @xmath53 thus , after much effort and some applied magic having to do with initial guess , the solutions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipole ] were obtained .",
    "as degree of non - linearity is increased , the solution goes from a simple deformation ( b ) of a free dipole ( a ) through a sequence of sign reversals ( c , d ) which change the topology of @xmath3 surface .",
    "all of the dipole solutions have finite energy , as far away from the dipole field @xmath40 decays as @xmath42 .",
    "the most interesting result of this paper is that a version of critical collapse exists in a theory without gravity , and a simple one at that .",
    "the criticality is driven by an attractive self - interaction of the field .",
    "the critical solutions are long - lived , and are likely the static soliton - like solutions we found .",
    "inverse lifetime of a collapsing wavepacket scales linearly with amplitude for large amplitudes or homogeneous configurations , but switches over to a much shallower power law close to criticality .",
    "the value of critical exponent is determined by the spectrum of unstable perturbation of the critical solution @xcite .",
    "this we leave for future study , but since approximate universality is observed in the critical collapse of arbitrary initial data , the spectrum should have a mass gap , or be discrete .",
    "we further investigate static spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "the theory admits everywhere regular localized vacuum solutions  solitons , but their energy is infinite due to slow decay of the oscillating tails at spatial infinity .",
    "irregular solutions have an asymptotic at origin where effective coupling constant runs logarithmically , as the one in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "this , taken together with infinite energy of an isolated charge , lead to an interpretation of this theory as showing a classical analogue of confinement @xcite . leaving aside the matter of solutions being unstable , we find the story is substantially more complicated  in a general static solution two other intermediate asymptotic regimes interject between logarithmic running and the limit cycle contributing to energy divergence .",
    "we also construct static non - linear solutions for soliton  anti - soliton pair .",
    "such a dipole has finite energy , and thus forms a bound state . as a final note",
    ", we must remark that the classical conformal field theory we consider here is deceptively simple , but actual non - linear solutions have very rich phenomenology .",
    "in many ways they are similar to solitonic solutions of korteweg - de vries equation and petviashvili monopole vortices encountered in atmospheric science @xcite .",
    "if one breaks conformal invariance by introducing mass terms , static solitons discussed here will probably turn into oscillating breather modes , not quite like in @xcite , but rather related to oscillons discovered in @xcite .",
    "this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada under discovery grants program .",
    "as the theory is scale - invariant , the equations of motion can be rewritten in an autonomous form .",
    "introducing variable @xmath54 once again and switching over to logarithmic spatial scale @xmath55 , equation ( [ eq : static : phi ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath56 dynamical system can be analyzed in terms of classical renormalization group variables , effective coupling and its running @xmath57 as with any autonomous dynamical system , the order can be reduced by considering momentum a function of generalized coordinate @xmath58 , not the scale @xmath59 @xmath60 behavior of solutions as @xmath61 corresponds to an uv fixed point at @xmath62 , but the equation ( [ eq : rg ] ) admits _ two _ distinct flows to the fixed point , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( and only two in the power law class ) . substituting ansatz @xmath65 in ( [ eq : rg ] )",
    "@xmath66 one can see that for leading terms to cancel as @xmath67 , the power exponent in the second term has to coincide with the first or the last one .",
    "first alternative yields @xmath63 , the second @xmath64 . integrating renormalization group equations give corresponding asymptotic solutions @xmath68 so , which one is chosen by the static solution",
    "?    turns out the general solution follows both asymptotics in turn , abruptly switching over at a certain scale @xmath69 , as illustrated in fig .  [ fig : running ] .",
    "this can happen because , while the theory is scale - invariant , _ the solutions are not_. regular soliton solutions are characterized by a single length scale @xmath70 .",
    "irregular solutions introduce a second length scale @xmath71 related to the value of charge sourcing them . starting from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , the general solution then goes through four distinct asymptotic regions : the limit cycle ( [ eq : cn ] ) , the soliton core ( [ eq : rg : core ] ) , the transition over @xmath74 branch , and finally the asymptotically free regime with logarithmic running ( [ eq : rg : free ] ) .",
