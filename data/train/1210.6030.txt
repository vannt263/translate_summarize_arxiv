    "( _ i _ ) all the best fitting models are located close to the blue edge of the instability strip ( fig .",

    "the effective temperatures and absolute luminosities lie in a narrow ranges of @xmath26k and @xmath27 , respectively .",

    "( _ ii _ ) radius depends on metallicity and is equal to @xmath32 for @xmath28 and @xmath33 for @xmath31 .",
    "( _ iii _ ) considering the @xmath6-band light curves ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.bestmodels ] ) , clearly the best fit to the observed light curve is obtained for models with convective parameters of set s3 , and with @xmath34 ( for both metallicities , bottom two curves in fig .  [ fig.bestmodels ] ) .",
    "these are the models with the lowest value of @xmath35 .",
    "a slightly worse fit is obtained for models with @xmath36 . among these models",
    "the best ones are those with convective parameters of sets s2  and s3  and with the higher metallicity ( @xmath28 , third and fifth curve from top in fig .",
    "[ fig.bestmodels ] ) .",
    "for all these models the radial velocity curves well reproduce the observed curve , in particular , a bump on the ascending branch is present , although less pronounced than in observations .",
    "we conclude , that chemical composition typical for population i stars ( @xmath34 ) seems more appropriate for  ( see discussion in section  [ sec.concl ] ) .",
    "( _ iv _ ) for the lower metallicity models ( @xmath31 ) a phase shift between the model and the observed light curves is apparent for models of all three sets of convective parameters ( left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig.bestmodels ] ) .",
    "a minimum brightness in these models follows the observed minimum by @xmath37 pulsation cycle .",
    "the shift is also present in the case of the radial velocity curves , for all the models .",
    "a phase of maximum expansion velocity in our models occurs later than is observed .",
    "again the difference is slightly larger for the lower metallicity models . to explain these phase shifts we first note that we defined phase 0 as the phase of maximum radius .",
    "it is determined with the help of the radial velocity , which changes the sign . at around this phase a bump is present in the radial velocity curves , which manifests itself as a slower ( less steep ) variation of the radial velocity .",
    "thus , its exact location may influence our phasing of the model curves .",
    "the location of the bump depends on the @xmath38 period ratio which is a function of metallicity , as is evident from an analysis of the values given in tab .",
    "[ tab.bestmodels ] . at lower metallicity ,",
    "the @xmath38 ratio becomes larger and the bump moves up the ascending branch of the radial velocity curve .",
    "the second effect is a systematic difference between the observed and the computed phase lag between the radial velocity curves and the light curves .",
    "indeed , the phase lag of  is positive and equal to @xmath39 , while the phase lags for all our models ( tab .",
    "[ tab.bestmodels ] ) are systematically smaller and negative .",
    "a significantly better agreement is obtained for models with higher helium content , i.e. with @xmath34 .",
    "we also note that in spite of the model phase lags being all negative , the phase of maximum expansion velocity always precedes the phase of maximum brightness , just as in the case of . the negative value of @xmath40 results from the highly nonlinear shape of the light and radial velocity curves .",
    "( _ vi _ ) the model for , that reproduces both the light and radial velocity variation best ( has the lowest value of @xmath35 ) is the model with convective parameters of set s3  and with chemical composition of population i stars ( @xmath34 , @xmath28 ) .",
    "its absolute luminosity is @xmath41 and effective temperature is @xmath2k . among the models with chemical composition corresponding to population ii stars , the best two models ( with convective parameters of sets s2  and s3 ) have the same metallicity ( @xmath28 ) , luminosity ( @xmath42 ) , and nearly the same effective temperature ( @xmath43k ) .",
    "all our best matching models have very similar @xmath38 ratios , in agreement with interpretation that the bump is caused by the 2:1 resonance between the fundamental mode and the second overtone .",
    "at first ,  was recognised as a classical rr  lyrae star ",
    "its light variation and radial velocity curves mimic that observed in rr  lyrae stars pulsating in the fundamental mode . only its presence in the eclipsing binary system allowed to determine its mass and to reveal its true nature .",
    "its mass is only half the typical rr  lyrae mass , too low to ignite helium .",
    "it can not be a classical rr  lyrae star , its a product of mass transfer during the binary evolution .",
    "the incidence rate of such stars estimated by @xcite is only @xmath44per cent and only a fraction may be discovered through eclipses .",
    "majority of such binaries are expected to be non - eclipsing systems .",
    "consequently , direct estimate of mass of the pulsating component will not be possible .",
    "then , the shape of the light / radial velocity curve may mimic that of rrab star , as it is the case for , and lead to wrong interpretation .",
    "the goal of this section is to conduct a large model survey of the light and radial velocity curves of beps , to check how to distinguish these stars from classical rrab stars and to check whether the case of   rr  lyrae impostor  is a rule or an exception .",
    "we consider model sequences with three different masses corresponding to one - third  one - half the typical rr  lyrae mass , @xmath45 , @xmath0 ( mass of ) and @xmath46 , and with different absolute luminosities , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    "[ fig.hr2 ] we present the hr diagrams for models with @xmath53 ( top panel ) and @xmath54 ( bottom panel , adopting convective parameters of set s1 . for @xmath55 the hr diagram is plotted in the top left panel in fig .",

    ", the first overtone instability strip appears at the lowest luminosities .",
    "the models cover a wide period range from @xmath56 up to @xmath57 days .",
    "we focus our attention on models with @xmath58 below one day , as in rrab stars . as discussed in the previous section the 2:1 resonance",
    "is expected to shape the light and radial velocity curves of beps .",
    "for all considered masses , its loci ( thick dotted lines in figs .  [ fig.hr2 ] and [ fig.hr ] ) crosses the instability strip at fundamental mode periods between @xmath59 and @xmath60days .",
    "an analysis of the light and radial velocity curves and of the corresponding fourier decomposition parameters clearly show that indeed , the 2:1 resonance with the second overtone causes the progression of the light and radial velocity curve s shape .",
    "this is illustrated based on model sequences with @xmath55 ( and different luminosities ) and adopting convective parameters of set s1 .",
    "the bump progression , akin to that observed in classical cepheids is best visible for radial velocity curves .",

    "* ) and predictions based on analysis of amplitude equations for the 2:1 resonance @xcite . a clear drop in the pulsation amplitude is observed , followed by the decrease and minimum of the @xmath61 ratio at somewhat larger values of @xmath38 . in the case of the fourier phase ,",
    "a bell shape is apparent .",
    "the ascending part of the bell follows a universal progression ",
    "@xmath62 is a function of @xmath38 only ( for @xmath63 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath38 at which departure from this relation is observed and the highest possible value of @xmath62 depends strongly on the luminosity .",
    "the correlation of the fourier parameters progression with the @xmath38 ratio is lost if the fourier parameters are plotted versus the period  see the blue curves in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.fou_freak_rv ] , which represent the same model sequences as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig.fou.hp ] .",
    "no doubt , the 2:1 resonance is crucial in shaping the progression of the radial velocity curves .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.hp_curves ] ( right panel ) we plot the radial velocity curves along a sequence of @xmath64 . in contrast to fig .",
    "[ fig.per.curves ] , now a wide range of period ratios is probed , which clearly reveals the bump progression .",
    "the bump appears first in the middle of the ascending branch of the velocity curve , at the phase of maximum radius ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "then , as period increases and period ratio decreases , the bump moves towards the phase of maximum expansion velocity ( @xmath66 ) . for period ratios below @xmath67 the bump is present on the descending branch and disappears for @xmath68 .",
    "the bump progression is also visible for the @xmath6-band light curves ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.hp_curves ] ) , although in this case the interpretation is more difficult , because of additional features present in the light variation . at the highest effective temperature",
    "the light curve is roughly triangular .",
    "a trace of bump appears on the descending branch , just after the maximum brightness , which next , moves towards the ascending branch and deforms the brightness maximum . for effective temperatures below @xmath69k ( @xmath70 ) a pronounced bump is present on the ascending branch .",
    "it is present even for the lowest temperature model , and in general , is a feature of our models located in the centre and close to the red edge of the instability strip , even with period ratios as low as @xmath71 ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.hp_curves ] ) , although it is much less pronounced in such models .",
    "it is likely that other non - resonant effects play a role in shaping this bump .",
    "another feature of the light curves , well visible in fig .",
    "[ fig.hp_curves ] is a nearly flat and long phase of high brightness for cooler models ( @xmath72k ) . at the lowest effective temperatures , two brightness maxima at similar level",
    "are present .",
    "origin of such shape is most likely non - resonant and connected to the development of extensive zone of efficient convective transfer at the phase of maximum compression , which is sustained then for nearly half the pulsation cycle .",
    "analysis of figs .",
    "[ fig.fou.hp ] and [ fig.hp_curves ] indicates that the 2:1 resonance influences the shape of the light and radial velocity curves in a wide range of period ratios , which we estimate to @xmath73 .",
    "the border values of @xmath38 are plotted with thin dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig.hr2 ] and labelled with @xmath38 value .",
    "clearly the 2:1 resonance is influential in a significant part of the instability strip and hence , is the most important effect shaping the light and radial velocity curves of beps .",
    "another resonant effect which we find in our models is a period - doubling effect .",
    "for some models , we observe alternating deep and shallow minima / maxima in the light and radial velocity variation ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig.pd ] for exemplary light curves .",
    "consequently , pulsation repeats after two fundamental mode periods .",
    "the behaviour is found only for some model sequences and is restricted to rather narrow parameter ranges . for models adopting convective parameters of set s1",
    ", period doubling was found only in the least massive , most luminous models .",
    "their location is plotted with triangles in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.hr2 ] .",
    "as analysed by @xcite period doubling in the hydrodynamic models is caused by the half - integer resonances .",
    "the effect is observed in several types of large amplitude pulsators including rv  tau variables ( caused by the 5:2 resonance , @xmath74 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , rr  lyr stars showing the blazhko effect ( caused by the 9:2 resonance , @xmath75 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in bl  her stars ( caused by the 3:2 resonance , @xmath76 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig.hr2 ] we plot the loci of two half - integer resonances that might be influential in the case of beps models ( red lines ) .",
    "these are the 3:2 resonance with the first overtone ( @xmath76 ) and the 7:2 resonance with the fifth overtone ( @xmath77 ) . to cause the period doubling",
    ", the resonant overtone mode can not be damped too strongly @xcite .",
    "this is the case for both resonances .",
    "the fifth overtone is a trapped envelope mode in the discussed models , for which the growth rate is high @xcite . without the relaxation technique ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) however , it is hard to identify which resonance is operational in these models .",
    "as the models are limited to narrow parameter ranges we do not study this issue in more detail here .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of the overall properties of the model light and radial velocity curves for beps , in terms of their fourier decomposition parameters .",
    "to provide a feeling how reliable our non - linear code is in predicting the fourier parameters , and to provide a background for discussing the parameters of beps , we have conducted a model survey for classical rr  lyrae stars , briefly mentioned in section  [ sec.hydro ] , results of which were presented in fig .  [ fig.fou_normf ] .",
    "these models adopt the convective parameters of set s1 , but results for other sets of convective parameters are very similar . amplitude and @xmath61 amplitude ratio are modelled satisfactorily , a somewhat too low values of @xmath78 are predicted .",
    "fourier phases agree well with the observations , indicating that majority of rr  lyrae stars have absolute luminosity around @xmath79 .",
    "fourier parameters from similar survey of bep models are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig.fou_freak_light ] ( @xmath6-band light curves ) and [ fig.fou_freak_rv ] ( radial velocity curves ) for all considered model sequences . left panels in these figures illustrate the effects of different mass of the models ( with convective parameters of the models fixed to that of set s1 ) , while right panels illustrate the effects of using different convective parameters in the modelling ( sets s1 , s2 , and s3 ) , while mass of the models is fixed to @xmath0 . for each case , five model sequences with different absolute luminosities were computed .",
    "successive models in each sequence were computed with a step of @xmath52k in effective temperature .",
    "the first , shortest period model in each sequence is the hottest model located at the direct proximity of the blue edge of the instability strip .",
    "it is clear that with increasing luminosity , model sequences shift towards longer periods . in all the figures we also mark the location of  ( diamond ) and for the @xmath6-band light curves we also plot the location of rrab and rrc ( first overtone pulsators ) stars from the galactic bulge for a reference .",
    "such comparison is not possible in the case of radial velocity parameters . only for a few rr  lyrae stars coverage of radial velocity curves",
    "is good enough to allow determination of their fourier parameters .",
    "consequently , a meaningful comparison is not possible at the moment .",
    "we first discuss the fourier parameters for the @xmath6-band light curves displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig.fou_freak_light ] .",
    "as discussed before , we expect that the 2:1 resonance will have a significant effect in shaping the light curves .",
    "we first note that progressions of fourier parameters with pulsation period are very similar for different model sequences displayed in the figure .",
    "for example the @xmath61 progressions have a wavy shape with local minima in the middle and at the edges of the progression .",
    "@xmath61 drops for the shortest and the longest period as a result of amplitude decrease at the edges of the instability strip .",
    "the decrease of @xmath61 in the middle of the progression is a resonant effect ( see fig .  [ fig.fou.hp ] ) .",
    "as resonance centre falls at different periods for different model sequences , the minimum of @xmath61 also shifts in period .",
    "for example , for models with @xmath53 the resonance centre is located at @xmath80days for @xmath47 and at @xmath81day for @xmath51 ( top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig.hr2 ] ) .",
    "the predicted peak - to - peak amplitudes of beps are below @xmath59mag in the @xmath6-band , which is smaller than the typical amplitudes of rrab stars with periods shorter than @xmath82days . in this period range",
    "also the predicted amplitude ratios are smaller than in rrab stars .",
    "we note however , that the predictions for amplitudes and amplitude ratios should be treated with caution .",
    "amplitudes and consequently amplitude ratios strongly depend on the convective parameters adopted in the model , which is well visible if one compares the results for the models of sets s1  and s3  in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.fou_freak_light ] .",
    "the lower the eddy viscosity ( set s3 ) , the higher become the amplitudes and amplitude ratios .",
    "convective parameters should be calibrated to match the observational constraints , in particular the amplitude - period relation for a given group of pulsators . with only one bep known at the moment",
    "the calibration is necessarily very rough .",
    "fortunately , the fourier phases do not depend strongly on the pulsation amplitude , which is clear from the analysis of the bottom right panels of figs .",
    "[ fig.fou_freak_light ] and [ fig.fou_freak_rv ] .",
    "the fourier phases depend only weakly on the adopted convective parameters as well .",
    "thus , the fourier phases are the best and most reliable predictions of our modelling .    the progressions for the fourier phases ( bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig.fou_freak_light ] ) are very interesting .",
    "note that for @xmath4 the model sequences were plotted twice , shifted by @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath83 ambiguity in the values of the fourier phases should be kept in mind while analysing the figures .",
    "we note that @xmath62 progressions strongly depend on the mass and on the absolute luminosity adopted in the models .",
    "thus , @xmath62 may provide useful constraints on the physical parameters of beps discovered in the future .",
    "although for the majority of our models @xmath62 significantly differs from the rrab progression , values typical for rrab stars are also possible , particularly for models located on the hot side of the instability strip .",
    "consequently @xmath62 is not the best indicator of bep .",
    "it is the @xmath4 fourier phase that may be used to distinguish beps from rr  lyrae stars .",
    "clearly , the values of @xmath4 predicted for beps differ significantly form the values typical for rr  lyrae stars . only very close to the blue edge of the instability strip ( and",
    "this is the case for ) the values of @xmath4 are similar for the two groups . through",
    "the majority of the instability strip @xmath4 is larger in the beps models . for cooler models",
    "the @xmath4 value increases . in the middle of",
    "the instability strip the difference between @xmath4 as predicted for beps and the rrab progression is around @xmath84rad . for lower masses",
    "the difference becomes smaller , but even for @xmath45 models the difference is about @xmath44rad .",
    "we also note that at shorter periods bep models are also different from rrc stars .",
    "the predicted amplitudes are larger than those of rrc stars , and the same is true for the @xmath61 ratio .",
    "the modelled fourier phases , both @xmath62 and @xmath4 , fall in between the rrab and rrc progressions .",
    "the phases are larger than in rrab stars , but smaller than in rrc stars .    in the case of the radial velocity curves , the fourier parameters displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig.fou_freak_rv ] should be treated as predictions , to be compared with future observations of beps .",
    "it is hard to pinpoint the expected differences between the fourier parameters for beps and those for rrab stars , as radial velocity observations of rrab stars are currently very scarce .",
    "the @xmath62 values seem to be the most interesting ones for radial velocity curves .",
    "they depend only slightly on the adopted convective parameters .",
    "the bell shape is a result of the bump progression , and this is the most important difference between beps and rrab stars .",
    "no bump progression is expected in the latter case .",
    "the presence of a bump on a radial velocity curve is thus a good indicator for a bep .",
    "the situation is more difficult in the case of the light curves , as additional features ( bumps , shoulders ) which may result for example from the shock propagating in the atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are commonly present in rrab stars .",
    "we also note that the @xmath62 values for the radial velocity curves might be used as an indicator of mass and absolute luminosity .",
    "in section  [ sec.resultsbep ] we have conducted a model survey to reproduce the observed properties of .",
    "our best model adopts the convective parameters of set s3 , and a chemical composition typical for population i stars , i.e. @xmath34 and @xmath28 .",
    "the model is located at the blue edge of the instability strip , its absolute luminosity is @xmath41 and effective temperature is @xmath85k .",
    "the model light curve fits the observed light variation very well .",
    "good agreement was also obtained for the radial velocity curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig.bestmodels ] ) . we have reproduced the bump on the ascending branch of the radial velocity curve of , and traced its origin to the 2:1 resonance between the fundamental mode and the second overtone , @xmath86 .",
    "the models with a chemical composition typical for population ii stars ( @xmath36 ) also reproduce the observations of  well and have nearly the same luminosity and effective temperature .",
    "we note that although the mass of  is very low and its pulsation resembles that of an rr lyrae star ,  is the product of mass transfer in the binary system .",
    "5.4gyr ago the progenitor of  was a @xmath87 star , as models of @xcite indicate and thus , the chemical composition typical for population i stars is very likely the correct one .",
    "we also considered models with other values of convective parameters .",
    "the resulting properties of the best matching models for  are then very similar to those quoted above ( see tab .  [ tab.bestmodels ] ) and therefore depend only slightly on the detailed treatment of convection in the model .",
    "we note that the phase lag between the radial velocity curve and the light curve is systematically smaller in our models than that observed in .",
    "more computations are needed to find out how this discrepancy might be removed .",
    "the current models indicate that a slight helium enrichment might be needed .",
    "also effects of turbulent convection , not considered in this study ( e.g. turbulent pressure , overshooting ) need to be checked .",
    "a more detailed modelling of  is planned in the near future .",
    "the effective temperature of  estimated by @xcite is @xmath88k larger ( @xmath21k ) than in our best matching model .",
    "consequently , also the absolute luminosity is higher ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the estimates of effective temperature and absolute luminosity of  not only differ from our results , but are also in conflict with stellar pulsation theory .",
    "they place  outside the instability strip , as the analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig.hr ] clearly indicates .",
    "this conclusion is independent of the convective parameters and chemical composition adopted in the model calculations .",
    "the estimate of the effective temperature of  by @xcite was based on the assumed @xmath90k effective temperature of the secondary component .",
    "it is a typical temperature for a @xmath23 giant , but it is not an actual measurement .",
    "then , the effective temperature of the pulsating component of the binary was calculated using a temperature ratio ( @xmath91 ) obtained from the analysis of the light curve of the binary . to check how the assumption on @xmath92 affects the results we have redone the analysis of @xcite but adopting lower values of @xmath92 .",
    "it turned out that a decrease of @xmath92 by @xmath52k leads to a decrease of @xmath93 by @xmath94k .",
    "thus , only a slight decrease of the effective temperature of the secondary component , by @xmath95k , brings the effective temperature of  into agreement with the effective temperature resulting from our best models .",
    "the absolute luminosity is still somewhat too high ( @xmath96 ) as compared to our models , which is caused by slightly different estimates of the radius .",
    "the radius of  estimated by @xcite is @xmath20 , and , as we checked , is independent on the assumed value of @xmath92 .",
    "the values inferred from our models ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.hr ] and tab .",
    "[ tab.bestmodels ] ) are lower by up to @xmath97 ( @xmath97 for models with @xmath28 and @xmath98 for models with @xmath31 ) .",

    "we have conducted a large non - linear model survey for the new class of variable stars . the aim was to provide the criteria to distinguish beps from classical rr  lyrae pulsators .",
    "the resonant bump progression caused by the 2:1 resonance between the fundamental mode and the second overtone is the main factor expected to determine the shapes of the light and radial velocity curves of beps .",
    "this is not the case for classical rr  lyrae stars . in the latter case ,",
    "the 2:1 resonance falls close to the red edge of the instability strip and hence , no bump progression is observed in classical rr  lyrae stars .",
    "thus , the presence of a bump may indicate the binary evolution of the rr  lyrae impostor .",
    "we note that the location of the bump on the radial velocity curve is a measure of the @xmath38 ratio , which provides an excellent constraint on the stellar models . in the case of the light curves",
    ", one may expect pronounced bumps on the ascending branch and long and flat , or long and double - peaked phases of high brightness ( fig .",
    "[ fig.hp_curves ] ) . in some of our models with the lowest @xmath99 ratio we find a period - doubling effect ( fig .  [ fig.pd ] ) .",
    "the other excellent discriminant of the new class of pulsating stars is the value of the @xmath4 fourier phase for the @xmath6-band light curve . except the models located extremely close to the blue edge of the instability strip , the expected values of @xmath4 differ significantly from the typical values for rrab stars .",
    "the values of @xmath62 on the other hand , might be useful indicators of stellar mass and absolute luminosity .",
    "we also note that beps are expected to change ( decrease ) their periods very fast @xcite .",
    "our models clearly indicate that with its light and radial velocity curves strongly mimicking the typical rr  lyrae curves , might be a rare case . for the majority of beps , significant departures from the observational properties of rr",
