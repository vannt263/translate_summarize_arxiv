    "dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) are very faint galaxies ( some of the recently discovered dsph satellites of milky way are the faintest known galaxies , @xcite ) which tend to cluster around large galaxies @xcite . among the 50 or so local group dsphs discovered so far , only two ( tucana and cetus ) are relatively isolated ; the rest are located in the vicinity of either milky way or m31 , and are believed to be their satellites . despite their dull appearances ( no ongoing star formation ; little or no interstellar medium ; @xcite ) , dsphs are fascinating objects  largely due to the fact that they contain significant quantities of dark matter ( dm ) , and as such represent the smallest observed scale of dm clustering .",
    "state of the art cosmological simulations predict that large galaxies should contain many smaller sub - halos which have not had time to be completely destroyed by the tidal field of the host halo .",
    "dsphs are believed to represent at least some of this substructure @xcite .",
    "dsphs present two major challenges to the standard ( @xmath10cdm ) cosmological model .",
    "first , despite the recent advances on both theoretical and observational sides , there still appears to be a factor of a few discrepancy between the observed and predicted numbers of milky way satellites ",
    "so called `` missing satellites problem '' @xcite .",
    "second , some indirect evidence ( such as the `` timing paradox '' for the five globular clusters of fornax dsphs ; @xcite ) suggests that dm distribution in dsphs has a flat core , which is in line with what is deduced for larger dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies @xcite , but is at odds with the results of many cosmological simulations , predicting central divergent dm cusps with the logarithmic slope @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "different theoretical mechanisms suggested to rectify this `` cusp  core '' problem produce different velocity anisotropy profiles for stars .",
    "for example , our stellar feedback mechanism @xcite , where the dm cusp is flattened via gravitational heating from the interstellar gas sloshed around by supernovae , results in isotropic stellar cores . on the other hand , the dynamical friction mechanism of @xcite ,",
    "where the cusp is heated by massive baryonic clumps passively spiraling in towards the galactic center , should produce noticeable central tangential anisotropy @xcite .",
    "constraining stellar anisotropy profiles in spheroidal galaxies can hence be a valuable indirect way of identifying the correct theoretical mechanism of dm core formation .",
    "@xcite was the first who deduced the presence of significant amounts of dm in a dsph ( draco ) , based on the measurements of the line - of - sight velocities of only three stars .",
    "since then , the number of stars in dsphs with known line - of - sight velocities has grown dramatically : recently published homogeneous datasets have up 2500 stars per galaxy ( for fornax ; @xcite ) .",
    "mass modeling of dsphs has dramatically improved as well : from simple global estimates based on the virial theorem @xcite , to spatial models with strong simplifying assumptions ( such as `` mass follows light '' ; @xcite ) , to more recent modeling efforts with fewer assumptions @xcite .",
    "the classical method of dsph mass modeling is to solve the spherical jeans equation for a range of models with different dm density profiles , and then to compare the predicted stellar line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles with the observed ones  using either @xmath12 or maximum likelihood techniques to find the best models .",
    "the spherical symmetry assumption is reasonably accurate given the spheroidal appearances of dsphs ( ellipticity @xmath13 is usually @xmath14 or less ) , absence of disk - like structures , and negligible rotation in these systems @xcite . to solve the spherical jeans equation ( that is , to derive the stellar velocity dispersion as a function of radius )",
    ", one has to specify two functions : total ( dm @xmath15 stars ) density , and stellar velocity anisotropy ( @xmath16 ) profiles . to reduce the dimensionality of the problem",
    ", one usually assumes a certain shape of the @xmath16 radial profile  either a constant , or the osipkov - merritt profile ( purely isotropic at the center , purely radially anisotropic in the infinity ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are no reasons to believe that stellar anisotropy is constant in dsphs .",
    "for example , simple dynamical models which start with an initially non - equilibrium stellar configuration inside the dm halo ( `` cold collapse '' , @xcite , and `` hot collapse '' , @xcite ) tend to produce the stellar velocity isotropy at the center and a variable degree of radial anisotropy in the outskirts of the relaxed stellar body .",
    "as already mentioned , the central parts of dwarf galaxies can be significantly affected by dense and violent baryons , which may either randomize stellar velocities @xcite or induce a significant tangential anisotropy @xcite . on the observational side",
    ", dsphs are known to be non - homogeneous objects , with younger , more metal - rich and kinematically colder star populations concentrated towards the center @xcite ; it would be strange if the stellar velocity anisotropy would be the same across these different populations of stars .",
    "given the expectation that @xmath16 is not constant across a dsph and that the important properties of dsphs ( such as the central logarithmic slope of the dm density ) are strongly degenerate with respect to the unknown stellar velocity anisotropy @xcite , proper mass modeling of dsphs has to include radially variable stellar anisotropy .",
    "to the best of my knowledge , the only example of a full - fledged jeans mass modeling of dsphs with variable @xmath16 is the work by @xcite . here",
    "i outline the main differences of my approach with that of @xcite .    1 .   in this paper ,",
    "i carry out mass modeling of the limited number ( five ; carina , fornax , leo  i , sculptor , and sextans ) of galactic dsphs with the highest quality , homogeneous data : large ( @xmath17 stars ) homogeneous datasets of stellar line - of - sight velocities @xcite and accurate stellar surface brightness profiles derived in a homogeneous manner in this paper .",
    "this is in contrast to the work of @xcite , who analyzed a much larger set of local group dsphs , with heterogeneously derived data and a wide range of data quality .",
    "i employ a `` brute force '' optimization while searching for the best fitting models .",
    "this approach generated a wealth of statistical data , which can be used for testing a variety of different hypotheses about the distribution of stars and dm in dsphs .",
    "the data are available online .",
    "the `` brute force '' approach coupled with a flexible dsph model allowed me to find the dsph parameters which the jeans analysis can constrain very well .",
    "specifically , i found that the total enclosed mass in a dsph can be constrained to a high accuracy ( two - sigma uncertainty as good as @xmath1815% , for fornax ) at a certain radius , which is different for different dwarfs .",
    "this information can be valuable for matching the galactic dsphs to the predictions of cosmological simulations .",
    "similarly , i derived tight constraints on the local dm density at a certain radius ( unique for each galaxy ) , which can be used in the research aimed at detecting dm in dsphs via its annihilation signal .",
    "4 .   unlike @xcite , i properly account for the self - gravity of stars .",
    "this can be important for dsphs with dense stellar cores ( e.g. sculptor ) .",
    "i use an advanced ( with the variance due to random locations of stars within one radial bin removed ; see ",
    "[ good ] ) @xmath12 model fitting approach .",
    "unlike @xcite , who employed a maximum likelihood technique , my approach is insensitive to the ( unknown ) shape of the line - of - sight star velocity probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "i had two main goals for this paper .",
    "first , i wanted to find out which ( if any ) dsph parameters can be meaningfully constrained via the classical , jeans mass modeling approach , if such an analysis is pushed to the extreme ( large homogeneous observational datasets of stellar line - of - sight velocities ; a very flexible galactic model ; careful numerical analysis consuming a significant ",
    "@xmath19  cpu hours in my case  amount of supercomputing time ; a `` brute force '' optimization which ensures that no hidden `` valleys '' and local and global minima in the multi - dimensional likelihood manifold are missed ) . the second goal was to generate high - quality data which can be used to dramatically reduce computational time ( by restricting the model parameter space to be explored ) in future post - jeans ( analyzing the full shape of the stellar velocity pdf ) mass modeling efforts  which will be the subject of paper  ii in this series .",
    "as the dynamical state of the outer parts of dsphs is still a matter of debate ( specifically , some authors , e.g. @xcite , argue that the observed outskirts of these galaxies are undergoing a severe tidal disruption and hence are not in dynamic equilibrium , which would invalidate the jeans analysis for those parts ; but see @xcite for the opposite example ) , in the present study i put the main emphasis on recovering the _ inner _ structure of dsphs . unfortunately , the most interesting aspect of the inner structure of these galaxies  the `` dm cusp or core '' question  can not be addressed via the jeans analysis alone , as the central logarithmic slope of the dm density profile @xmath20 is known to be degenerate in this method .",
    "this follows from the properties of the spherical jeans equation @xcite , and is clearly visible even in the mass modeling with a constant stellar anisotropy @xcite . in this paper",
    "i obtain a more general result that @xmath21 is completely unconstrained by the jeans analysis not only at the center ( @xmath22 ) , but also at any other radius @xmath23 within the stellar body of the dwarf .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section    [ model ] describes the dsph model .",
    "section    [ obs_data ] discusses the observational data ( stellar line - of - sight velocities and stellar surface brightness profiles ) .",
    "section    [ fitting ] gives a detailed description of my @xmath12 optimization technique .",
    "section    [ results ] presents the main results of this study .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section    [ conclusions ] .",
    "assuming a spherical symmetry , the jeans equation for a two - component ( dm @xmath15 stars ) system can be written as    @xmath24    here @xmath23 is the distance from the center , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the stellar density , radial velocity dispersion , and anisotropy , and @xmath28 is the total ( dm @xmath15 stars ) gravitational potential .",
    "we introduced the anisotropy parameter @xmath27 in @xcite .",
    "it is defined as @xmath29 , and is related to the more conventional anisotropy parameter @xmath16 through @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "( here @xmath32 is the one - dimensional tangential velocity dispersion . ) unlike @xmath16 , the parameter @xmath27 is conveniently symmetric : it is equal to @xmath33 , 0 , and 1 for purely tangential , isotropic , and purely radial orbits , respectively .",
    "( the corresponding @xmath16 values are @xmath34 , 0 , and 1 , respectively . )",
    "i assume that the stellar anisotropy @xmath27 smoothly varies between the two asymptotic values , @xmath35 at the center and @xmath36 in the infinity :    @xmath37    @xcite . here",
    "@xmath38 is the anisotropy transition radius , and @xmath39 .",
    "the dm halo is assumed to have the following density profile :    @xmath40    ( here @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the dm scaling radius and density , respectively . )",
    "this is a generalization of the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nfw ) profile , with an arbitrary central logarithmic density slope @xmath20 and the outer slope of @xmath43 . in the limit @xmath44",
    "we recover the theoretical nfw profile ; when @xmath45 , we obtain a flat - cored profile , which is almost identical to the observationally inferred @xcite profile .",
    "stars are assumed to have a generalized plummer density profile ( see eq .",
    "( [ rho _ * ] ) in  [ sb ] ) . the dm contribution to the total gravitational potential @xmath28",
    "is obtained by numerical integration of the corresponding poisson equation ; the stellar contribution has simple analytical solutions ( different for different values of the stellar outer density slope @xmath46 ) .    to compare the solution of the jeans eq .",
    "( [ jeans ] ) with observations , one has to compute the stellar line - of - sight velocity dispersion , @xmath47 , as a function of the projected radius , @xmath48 :    @xmath49    @xcite here @xmath50 is the stellar surface density .",
    "overall , the model has six free parameters : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath20 ( characterize the dm distribution ) , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath38 ( characterize the stellar anisotropy profile ) .",
    "for jeans mass modeling it is essential to know stellar density profiles of dsphs as accurately as possible . these can be derived from surface brightness profiles if one assumes a spherical symmetry and a certain value for the stellar mass - to - light ratio . as galactic dsphs",
    "are located within 300  kpc from the sun and are fully resolved into stars , one has to employ star count techniques to derive their surface brightness profiles .",
    "traditionally , a few simple analytical stellar surface density profiles have been used for mass modeling of dsphs : empirical @xcite , plummer @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we showed in @xcite that the surface density profile of the form    @xmath51^{-(\\alpha-1)/2},\\ ] ]    corresponding to the `` generalized plummer law '' ,    @xmath52^{-\\alpha/2},\\ ] ]    describes the surface brightness profile of draco dwarf spheroidal extremely well .",

    "this operation boosted the absolute probability of the best fitting model for carina from 0.04 to 0.26 ( when @xmath81 ; see   [ method ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that all the six stars are located in the outer half of the radial bins , so this operation should have had very little impact on the analysis of the central parts of the galaxy  which is the main focus of the current study .",
    "two popular statistical methods used in mass modeling of dsphs are @xmath12 fitting and maximum likelihood analysis . both methods have advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the @xmath12 method complements naturally the jeans analysis , as both operate only with the second moment ( dispersion ) of the stellar velocity distribution , whereas for the maximum likelihood approach one has to assume a certain ( usually gaussian ) form for the line - of - sight velocity probability distribution function .",
    "this factor makes the @xmath12 fitting less sensitive to outliers , and hence a much better approach when one is interested in absolute probabilities of different models .",
    "the maximum likelihood method , on the other hand , is more appropriate for post - jeans mass modeling , where the full model line - of - sight velocity pdf is computed and compared to the data .",
    "the main disadvantages of the @xmath12 technique are that 1 ) one has to try a few different values for the number of the radial bins , @xmath82  but that only means longer computing time , and 2 ) in its simplest implementation , the random locations of individual stars within each radial bin is an additional source of variance in the analysis .",
    "to address the latter issue , for both the observational data and model i estimate the following quantity ( for each radial bin ) :    @xmath83    here @xmath84 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion at the specific location ( projected distance from the dwarf s center ) of the @xmath85-th star , and @xmath86 is the number of stars in the current radial bin .",
    "the quantity @xmath87 will converge to the square of the local line - of - sight velocity dispersion when the radial extent of the bin shrinks to zero and the number of stars ( @xmath86 ) grows to infinity .",
    "the important point is that such a convergence is not required when all one wants to do is to measure the statistical deviation of the model from the data .",
    "all is needed is to estimate the mean ( for the data and the model ) and standard deviation ( only for the data ) of the quantity @xmath87 for each radial bin , and then compute the @xmath12 deviation for @xmath87 from all the radial bins .",
    "as the @xmath87 measurements for both observational data and model are carried out for the same projected distances from the center of the dwarf ( corresponding to the distances of actual stars ) , the variance due to random locations of stars within radial bins is completely removed .    of course",
    ", we do not know from the observations the values of @xmath84 at the position of each star .",
    "instead , we know the individual line - of - sight velocities ( corrected for the systemic velocity of the galaxy ) , @xmath88 , and the associated measurement uncertainties , @xmath89 .",
    "one can use these known quantities to write down the following unbiased estimator of @xmath87 ( without any assumptions on the shape of the velocity pdf ) :    @xmath90    this expression is valid even for the cases when the line - of - sight velocity dispersion changes dramatically within a single radial bin .",
    "the standard deviation of @xmath91 can be estimated from the following expression ,    @xmath92^{1/2},\\ ] ]    which does require the velocity dispersion to be approximately constant within a single bin .",

    "i carried out the classical jeans mass modeling of the five dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the highest quality observational data  carina , fornax , leo  i , sculptor , and sextans .",
    "my primary goal was to push the analysis to its limits , by developing a flexible enough galactic model ( with variable stellar velocity anisotropy ) , refining the traditional @xmath12 fitting algorithm , and investing a significant amount ( @xmath19  cpu  hours ) of supercomputing time to carry out an exhaustive model parameter optimization .",

    "moreover , i show that the local dm density logarithmic slope , @xmath202 , is unconstrained at all the radii probed by the data . as a consequence",
    ", one must resort to much more computationally expensive post - jeans mass modeling techniques ( which deal with the full probability distribution function for stellar line - of - sight velocities , and not just the dispersion ) to be able to solve the `` cusp  core '' issue for dsphs , or to identify theoretical mechanisms responsible for flattening dm cusps in dwarf galaxies ( by constraining the stellar velocity anisotropy profiles ) . *",

    "these constraints can be used in projects aimed at detecting dm in dsphs via its annihilation signal . *",
    "i show that stellar anisotropy profiles are very poorly constrained in jeans mass modeling .",
    "the only useful results here are that the pure central tangential anisotropy is excluded at better than two - sigma level for three out of the five dsphs , and that the data are consistent with the global stellar velocity isotropy for all the five dwarfs . *",
    "a significant advantage of the exhaustive search through the multi - dimensional model parameter space employed in this study , with all the intermediate results stored and available online , is that the results can be used for many other projects .",

    "<S> using a flexible galactic model with variable stellar velocity anisotropy , i apply the classical jeans mass modeling approach to the five dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the largest homogeneous datasets of stellar line - of - sight velocities ( between 330 and 2500 stars per galaxy )  </S>",
    "<S> carina , fornax , leo  i , sculptor , and sextans . </S>",
    "<S> i carry out an exhaustive model parameter search , assigning absolute probabilities to each parameter combination . </S>",
    "<S> my main finding is that there is a well defined radius ( unique for each galaxy ) where the jeans analysis constraints on the enclosed mass are tightest , and are much better than the constraints at previously suggested radii ( e.g. 300  pc ) . for carina , fornax , leo  i , sculptor , and sextans the enclosed dm mass is @xmath0 ( at 410  pc ) , @xmath1 ( at 925  pc ) , @xmath2 ( at 390  pc ) , @xmath3 ( at 435  pc ) , and @xmath4 ( at 1035  pc ) , respectively ( two - sigma uncertainties ; in @xmath5  m@xmath6 units ) . </S>",
    "<S> local dm density has the tightest constraints at smaller ( and also unique for each galaxy ) radii . </S>",
    "<S> the largest central dm density constraint is for sculptor : @xmath7  @xmath8  pc@xmath9 ( at two - sigma level ) . </S>",
    "<S> i show that the dm density logarithmic slope is totally unconstrained by the jeans analysis at all the radii probed by the data ( and not just at the center , as was demonstrated before ) . </S>",
    "<S> stellar velocity anisotropy has only very weak constraints . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , pure central tangential anisotropy is ruled out at better than two sigma level for three dwarfs , and the data are consistent with the global stellar velocity isotropy for all the five galaxies . </S>"
