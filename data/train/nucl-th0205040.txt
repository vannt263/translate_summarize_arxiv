    "though recently some hybrid models are used @xcite for the description of the hadronic phase , we here use a conventional description in which the hadronic phase is in local equilibrium .    in this paper ,",

    "single - particle distributions are used as inputs in order to determine initial parameters rather than outputs .",
    "however , it is not trivial whether we succeed to reproduce experiments with `` natural parameters '' or not .",

    "thus , dynamical models such as hydrodynamical models are indispensable for understanding the relation between observed correlation functions and the space - time history of the system . however , up to now , any dynamical model assuming qgp failed to explain the experimental hbt radii in rhic consistently with the single - particle spectra @xcite and elliptic flow @xcite , as being known as `` hbt puzzle .
