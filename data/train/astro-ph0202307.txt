    "the 32nd object in the catalog of messier ( 1850 ) has come to be known as the archetype of high surface brightness , low - luminosity , _ compact elliptical _ galaxies ( de vaucouleurs 1961 ) .",
    "it has been proposed that they may be the dense cores of tidally truncated , or at least modified , ordinary elliptical galaxies ( king 1962 ; faber 1973 ; nieto & prugniel 1987 ; choi , guhathakurta , & johnston 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that m32 ( ngc  221 ) may in fact never have been an elliptical galaxy , but is instead the bulge of a ( partially ) stripped disk galaxy ( bekki et al .",
    "2001 ; see also nieto 1990 )",
    ".    using the tight ( @xmath8 ) correlation between the central concentration index @xmath9 of a bulge and the mass of its central supermassive black hole ( smbh ; graham et al .",
    "2001a ) , provides a new constraint capable of determining which proposition , if either , is correct . simply by modelling m32 s surface brightness profile as either a one - component ( @xmath1 ) elliptical , or as a 2-component ( @xmath1 bulge + exponential ) lenticular or spiral galaxy , and knowing its smbh mass , allows one to decipher which scenario is more probable .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces m32 s surface brightness profile which is modelled in section 2.1 .",
    "section 3 introduces m32 s velocity dispersion measurements and smbh mass estimates into the discussion , supporting the notion that the bulge _ and disk _ decomposition is the correct one .",
    "m32 s major - axis , @xmath10-band surface brightness profile presented in kent ( 1987 ) is reanalyzed here .",
    "the data was obtained using an rca ccd attached , at different times , to three telescopes with different fields of view at the whipple observatory on mount hopkins .",
    "the observing procedures are described in kent ( 1983 ) and the ( remarkably standard ) reduction procedure given in kent ( 1987 ) .",
    "the main complication with this galaxy is its proximity to m31 ( andromeda ) .",
    "it resides ( in projection ) within the outer disk of m31 , and so the disk of m31 had to first be modelled and then subtracted .",
    "kent wrote , `` _ the light from m31 was removed approximately by fitting second order polynomials to the background light in the frame of m32 obtained with the bausch & lomb 8000 _ [ a 20 cm aperture telescope with a @xmath11 field of view ] _ excluding an area about m32 itself _ '' .",
    "ultimately , uncertainties in the sky - background level resulted in the termination of the profile at @xmath12@xmath1324 @xmath10-mag arcsec@xmath14 .",
    "further complications and solutions are described in kent ( 1987 ) , and wo nt be repeated here for the following reason . after commencing this work , choi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) presented new @xmath15- and @xmath16-band surface brightness profiles for m32 .",
    "these show very good agreement over the radial range in common with kent ( 1987 ) , and extend to 420@xmath6 .",
    "this lends confidence that the publicly available data from kent ( 1987 ) is reliable .",
    "the profiles of choi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) will however be referred to in a qualitative manner .",
    "inner components such as nuclear disks , star clusters , flattened cores , etc . , are known to reside within the central @xmath17 of many galaxy s ( e.g. , rest et al .",
    "2001 ; ravindranath et al .",
    "we wish to avoid such features here as we are presently only concerned with the bulge ( and outer disk , if one exists ) of m32 . however , typically observed galaxies are considerably more distant than m32 . at a distance of 0.8 mpc , with the exception of the milky way , m32 is some 10 times closer than any other galaxy with a positive smbh detection ( kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ; merritt & ferrarese 2001b ) .",
    "its nuclear region is therefore very well resolved : 1@xmath6 is equivalent to 3.87 pc . if m32 was located at the distance of the virgo cluster , exclusion of its central arcsecond would translate to the removal of the inner @xmath7 60 - 80 pc ( @xmath7 15 - 20@xmath6 at its present location ) .",
    "bker et al .  (",
    "2001 ) chose to model the central excesses ( above that of the bulge ) found in hst images of spiral galaxies with a power - law .",
    "tonry ( 1984 ) noted that the inner 10@xmath6 of m32 displays a power - law shape .",
    "this may therefore be a somewhat common feature of bulges when modelling ground - based images which have not resolved , or avoided , such central excesses . ] .",
    "michard & nieto ( 1991 ) presented evidence that the inner @xmath18 of m32 contains a nuclear disk , however this has subsequently been refuted by lauer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who found no photometric evidence for separate nuclear components in hst images .",
    "however , the presence of an apparent excess central flux did result in kent ( 1987 ) excluding the inner 15@xmath6 from his model fitting , and choi et al ( 2002 ) excluding the inner 10@xmath6 , which is also done here . apart from this ,",
    "the entire surface brightness profile beyond 10@xmath6 is modelled here .",
    "the data from table 3 of kent ( 1987 ) , and also a resampling of kent s figure 1 ( to give an equal spacing in radius , effectively providing a more even weighting [ radially ] to the data ) , are modelled .    both a seeing - convolved @xmath1 model and a seeing - convolved ( @xmath1 + exponential ) model were fitted . in both cases ,",
    "all model parameters were simultaneously fitted using the quasi - newton , non - linear least - squares algorithm uncmnd ( kahaner , moler , & nash 1988 ) which was iterated until convergence on the optimal solution giving the smallest @xmath19 value .",
    "all parameters were allowed to range freely in the fitting process , the only constraint was that they must be positive real numbers .",
    "the seeing was reported by kent ( 1987 ) to have a fwhm of 1.3@xmath6 , and therefore , due to the exclusion of the inner 10@xmath6 , has little effect on the results which are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "several truncations of the outer profile were explored , but the overall conclusion was always the same : _",
    "m32 can not be modelled as , that is to say it is not ( structurally ) , a single component system_. the curvature in the residual profile of figure  [ fig1]a is classic evidence of this .",
    "importantly , m32 can be described exceptionally well with the standard two - component model used these days to model disk galaxies with bulges + exponential ) model resulted in 86% more scatter than using an ( @xmath1 + exponential ) model , and a rather unimpressive fit . ] .",
    "the notably small residuals are compelling evidence that this model is likely to be correct .",
    "this is , however , not to say that m32 has a rotationally supported disk of stars , only that is has an outer exponential distribution of stars . to help evaluate",
    "if the two - component model is indeed correct , let us look at the resulting structural parameters to see if they are consistent with those of known bulge / disk systems .",
    "the bulge - to - disk size ratio ( @xmath4 ) is 0.20 , in good agreement with that of normal disk galaxies ( graham 2001 , and references therein ) and suggests nothing unusual .",
    "the logarithm of the bulge - to - disk luminosity ratio ( @xmath20 ) is 0.22 and typical of an s0 galaxy .",
    "the effective half - light radius of the bulge is 27@xmath6 , in reasonable agreement with the value of 32@xmath6 derived by kent when modelling the radial interval @xmath21 , and even agrees well with the value of 30@xmath6 found by de vaucouleurs ( 1953 ) .",
    "the effective bulge surface brightness is 18.23 @xmath10-mag arcsec@xmath14 , the central bulge surface brightness is 15.31 @xmath10-mag arcsec@xmath14 , and the absolute magnitude of the bulge is 16.34 @xmath10-mag .",
    "further support for the above bulge / disk decomposition comes from the new location of m32 in several structural parameter diagrams for bulges .",
    "m32 is a distant outlier in the insightful @xmath22-@xmath23 diagram presented in jerjen & binggeli ( 1997 ; their figure 2 ) . noting that their value of @xmath24 corresponds to our value of @xmath25 , when @xmath2 ( in our notation ) m32 moves up into the very center of points , and indeed the very center of the relation defined by the dwarf galaxies ( see also graham 2001 , his figure 14 ) .",
    "the reason for this is that the disk had biased jerjen & binggeli s one - component @xmath1 fit to m32 s light profile , resulting in a value of @xmath24 which is @xmath75 in our notation .",
    "this additionally explains the deviant nature of m32 in the @xmath26-@xmath23 diagram , and most of the discrepancy in the @xmath27-@xmath23 diagram .",
    "the suggestion by wirth & gallagher ( 1984 ) that compact elliptical galaxies may be the extension of brighter elliptical galaxies , based on color , luminosity , and velocity dispersion ( and the existence of isolated compact elliptical galaxy candidates ) would appear to be correct in the sense that the bulge of m32 appears to be the faint extension of bulges and elliptical galaxies in general .",
    "what of the disk ?",
    "kent ( 1987 ) remarked that there `` _ seems to be an excess of light at large radii , with the excess having an exponential profile _ '' .",
    "the ellipticity profile of kent ( 1987 ) also suggests the presence of a distinct outer component in m32 , rising from @xmath28=0.11 at 150@xmath6 to @xmath28=0.19 by @xmath29 ( where the ellipticity was then held constant ) .",
    "this feature is even more clearly evident in the ellipticity profile of choi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , rising steadily from @xmath30 at 100@xmath6 to @xmath31 at 250@xmath6 .",
    "the position angle also changes notably at 100@xmath6 - 150@xmath6 .",
    "the central disk surface brightness is 21.28 @xmath10-mag arcsec@xmath14 ( figure  [ fig1]b ) . applying the standard disk inclination correction @xmath32 , where @xmath28 is the ellipticity of the disk ( @xmath330.3 from choi et al .",
    "2002 ) and @xmath34=0.5 in the @xmath10-band ( tully & verheijen 1997 ) , would give a face - on central disk surface brightness of 21.48 @xmath10-mag arcsec@xmath14 .",
    "the definition of a low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxy , is one in which the central disk surface brightness is more than one magnitude fainter than the canonical freeman ( 1970 ) value of 21.65 @xmath15-mag arcsec@xmath14 ( which is about 20.5 @xmath10-mag arcsec@xmath14 ) .",
    "thus , m32 would just about qualify as a bulge - dominated lsb disk galaxy ( beijersbergen , de blok , & van der hulst 1999 ; impey & bothun 1997 ) .",
    "it is , however , because of it s size and magnitude , a dwarf galaxy .",
    "the scale - length of the disk is 130@xmath6 or 0.5 kpc .",
    "there is , however , possible evidence of a disturbance in the very outer profile ; it turns downward from an exponential profile at around 250@xmath6 .",
    "that is , there appears to be a lack of light , relative to the exponential part of the profile , beyond @xmath35 .",
    "this behavior is visible in both the data of kent ( 1987 ) and also that of choi et al .",
    "it is accompanied by a marked change in the behavior of the ellipticity profile of choi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , flattening ( or even decreasing slightly ) beyond 250@xmath6 .",
    "this may be a sign that material has been stripped away from the outer disk , although it is stressed that this conclusion is largely speculative .",
    "however , if true , this turnover would be biasing the surface brightness profile fit , making the disk scale - length appear shorter than it was before tidal - stripping commenced . truncating the ( equally spaced ) profile at 220@xmath6 , to avoid the potentially stripped outer disk , and thereby ( possibly ) sampling only the original undisturbed profile gives @xmath36 ( 1.27 kpc ) and @xmath37 for the disk",
    "for the bulge , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ; using the profile which is logarithmically spaced in radius gives @xmath40 ) . here",
    "the value of @xmath20=-0.09 , and @xmath4=0.09 , which are again not unreasonable .",
    "an @xmath1-only model fails to provide a convincing fit to this truncated radial range .",
    "the surface brightness profile of m32 can be modelled remarkably well as a combination of an @xmath1 bulge and an exponential disk of stars .",
    "the ellipticity profile additionally supports this interpretation of the data . however , could , instead , m32 s surface brightness profile be so disturbed that the outer exponential envelope is actually due to material pulled off from what was once a one - component @xmath0 ( i.e.  @xmath41 ) elliptical galaxy ?",
    "this scenario appears unlikely for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , somewhat persuasive evidence comes from the the central velocity dispersion of m32 which has been measured to be 76@xmath4210 km s@xmath43 ( van der marel et al .",
    "this figure is in good agreement with the average value of 74 km s@xmath43 obtained from numerous estimates listed in hypercat",
    ". it also agrees with gebhardt et al.s ( 2000 ) estimate of 75 km s@xmath43 for the luminosity weighted velocity dispersion within one effective radius .",
    "recently , it has been discovered that the central velocity dispersion of a bulge correlates strongly ( @xmath44 ) with the shape of the bulge light profile ( as measured with the srsic index : graham et al .",
    "2001b ; graham 2002 ) .",
    "galaxies with measured velocity dispersions less than 100 km s@xmath43 are observed to have values of @xmath45 .",
    "the measured value of @xmath2 for the bulge of m32 is thus exactly what one would expect from its dynamics , not @xmath41 .",
    "bulges ( which includes elliptical galaxies ) with values of @xmath46 have velocity dispersions typically greater than 100 km s@xmath43 .",
    "the second , related , line of reasoning comes from m32 s smbh mass . from ground",
    "based kinematical data , tonry ( 1984,7 ) predicted a smbh mass of ( 3 - 10)@xmath47 at the center of m32 .",
    "this pioneering work has been confirmed with hst data , from which van der marel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) derived a smbh mass of ( 3.4@xmath420.7)@xmath47 , and more recently joseph et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find a mass of ( 2 - 4)@xmath47 .",
    "the velocity dispersion ( @xmath48 ) and smbh mass ( @xmath49 ) combination of m32 is known to fall on the @xmath50-@xmath51 relation for ( non - disturbed ) ellipticals and bulges ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; merritt & ferrarese 2001a ) . thus ,",
    "unless the process of tidal stripping modifies both the central velocity dispersion and the smbh mass in such a way that it preserves the @xmath50-@xmath51 relation , the central structure and dynamics of m32 are likely to be that of the original ( i.e.  undisturbed ) galaxy .",
    "indeed , due to the higher densities at smaller radii , the central velocity dispersion and hence inner mass distribution and therefore inner light profile are expected to remain largely unaffected by the outer stripping process .",
    "taken with the result in the previous paragraph , this strongly suggests that the @xmath52 bulge profile is the original shape of the bulge .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the @xmath50-@xmath22 relation for bulges .",
    "it is a variant of the relation between smbh mass and central bulge concentration ( @xmath53 $ ] ) shown in graham et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "( the parameter @xmath9 is a monotonicly increasing function of @xmath24 , trujillo et al .  2001 . ) if m32 did ever have an @xmath0 profile , then ( from figure  [ fig3 ] ) its smbh mass should have once been and should still be @xmath54 , and certainly greater than @xmath55 .",
    "given the bulge value of @xmath2 agrees with the actual smbh mass estimate ( and with m32 s velocity dispersion ) , the stars composing the outer exponential envelope are almost certainly an excess ( relative to the bulge ) which have not come from a reshaped bulge bulge to the inner profile of m32 is likely because of the limited radial range @xmath56 they used to do this . ] .",
    "all of this is not to say that the outer profile of m32 has not been disrupted , indeed , the deficit of stars in the outer profile , causing the downward kink ( or break ) in the disk , may have been due to gravitational stripping by m31 .",
    "this deficit is also visible in the @xmath15- and @xmath16-band profiles of choi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and hence less likely to be a systematic error in the profile extraction technique of kent ( 1987 ) .",
    "indeed , the recently reported tidal stream of metal - rich stars around m31 is thought to have likely come from m32 and/or ngc  205 ( ibata et al .",
    "the presence of a disk may also explain the intermediate - age ( 5 - 15 gyr ) stellar population in m32 ( e.g.  grillmair et al .",
    "1996 ; davidge 2000 ) .",
    "perhaps a comment on nomenclature would be beneficial here .",
    "kormendy & gebhardt ( 2001 ) used the words ` compact ' and ` fluffy ' when referring to bulges .",
    "it should be noted that this has no reference at all to varying profile ` shape ' ( or equivalently ` concentration ' , according to the mathematical definition given in trujillo et al .",
    "2001 , their equation 5 and 6 ) .",
    "that is , no reference to departures from the @xmath0 law , or structural homology , are implied by their terms ` compact ' and ` fluffy ' .",
    "the @xmath0 law only has a horizontal scale term ( @xmath57 ) and a vertical scale term ( @xmath58 or @xmath59 ) , the shape , or concentration , is exactly the same for all @xmath0 profiles .",
    "kormendy & gebhardt ( 2001 ) discussed variations in @xmath60 and @xmath61 when they referred to ` compact ' and ` fluffy ' .",
    "hence , although m32 is regarded as compact , it s central concentration @xmath9 is actually rather low .",
    "bekki et al.s ( 2001 ) n - body / sph simulations of tidal interactions between m31 and an orbiting early - type spiral galaxy predict either a complete stripping of the disk , or at least a vertical heating of the satellite s disk to create a thick disk .",
    "clearly a faint disk , with very little gas ( welch & sage 2001 ) , still surrounds m32 .",
    "much of the gas and stars may indeed have been stripped away , resulting in the low surface brightness disk .",
    "also possible , is the suggestion by bekki et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that tidal interactions with m31 funnelled some of m32 s gas to its center , forming a massive starburst ( see also noguchi & ishibashi 1986 ) .",
    "this could account for the excess central flux within the inner @xmath62 of m32 having an age of @xmath74 gyrs ( vazdekis & arimoto 1999 ; del burgo et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "compact elliptical galaxies are a rare class of objects .",
    "a closer inspection of such objects seems warranted in order to inspect whether the species is indeed real , or simply a case of misclassification .",
    "i wish to thank peter erwin for providing me with kent s ( 1987 ) surface brightness profile of m32 , resampled with equal spacing in radius , and for useful discussions which helped to shape this paper .",
    "i am also grateful to carme gallart for her comments on this work .",
