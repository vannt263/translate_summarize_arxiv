    "analyzing structure factors and correlations in many - particle systems is a standard way to study collective behaviour in real experiments , computer simulations and theoretical frameworks .",
    "for example , for a system with short range microscopic interactions , placed in thermal equilibrium , there are no long range spatial correlations in general .",
    "their presence is a typical signal that the system is at a critical point . on the other hand , when such systems are driven into non - equilibrium steady states , long range correlations",
    "are often observed @xcite .",
    "another good example is the _ driven _ ising lattice gas @xcite .",
    "the role of the drive ( `` external field '' ) is to bias hopping rates along a particular direction on the lattice .",
    "in addition to many other unexpected features such as non - hamiltonian fixed points controlling the critical behavior @xcite , the system exhibits long range spatial correlations _ at all temperatures _ above criticality , as a result of the breakdown of the traditional fluctuation - dissipation relations @xcite . in momentum space , this appears as a discontinuity singularity of the structure factor at the origin @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit a simple , non - equilibrium model @xcite displaying similar features and examine the steady state structure factors from a more general point of view . in particular , we will construct _ the full distribution _ of various structure factors , using both monte carlo simulations and langevin equations following the method in ref@xcite .",
    "the model can be considered as a generalization of the kls @xcite model , in a fashion similar to an equilibrium ising model being extended to spin-1 @xcite or potts @xcite models , in that it involves _ two _ species of particles ( and holes ) .",
    "referred to as @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s , they are driven in opposite directions , subject to periodic boundary conditions . to keep the model simple , we suppress the usual ising nearest neighbor interaction and retain only the excluded volume constraint and the bias . in the simplest scenario ,",
    "charge exchange ( @xmath2 ) is not allowed .",
    "phase transitions in this multi - species model , in both one and two dimensions , have been investigated extensively@xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations @xcite in two dimensions and mean - field studies @xcite show that there is a transition , controlled by particle density and drive , from a spatially homogeneous ( disordered ) phase to a charge segregated one , where the excluded volume constraint leads to the mutual blocking of particles .",
    "we will focus on the disordered phase of the system , where we have a sound analytic understanding of the dynamics in terms of langevin equations . performing monte carlo simulations and measuring the full distributions of several structure factors , we find that the gaussian approximation is extremely effective in predicting these properties of our non - equilibrium system .",
    "in contrast to the earlier study @xcite , the structure factors here form a @xmath3 _ matrix _ , due to the presence of _ two _ species of particles , and the real and imaginary parts of the off - diagonal elements exhibit a characteristic asymmetry . the measurement of these distributions can be used to extract considerable information about the structure of the underlying linearized equations of motion , independent of model details .",
    "we consider a two dimensional fully periodic lattice with @xmath4 sites , each of which can be empty or occupied by a single particle . since there are two species we need two occupation variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being 0 or 1 , depending on whether a positive or negative particle is present at site @xmath8 .",
    "although we refer to these particles as `` charged '' , they do not interact via the coulomb potential .",
    "instead , they respond to an external , uniform `` electric '' field @xmath9 , directed along a specific lattice axis which we label the @xmath10-direction . we restrict ourselves to zero total charge , i.e. , @xmath11=0 $ ] . in the absence of the drive",
    ", the dynamics does not distinguish between the different species : both types hop randomly to nearest neighbor empty sites , with a rate @xmath12 .",
    "the electric field introduces a bias into these rates in such a way that jumps _ against _ the force will be exponentially suppressed . during one monte carlo step @xmath13",
    "nearest neighbor bonds are chosen randomly .",
    "if a particle - hole pair is encountered , an exchange takes place with probability @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the charge of the particle and @xmath16 is the change of the @xmath17 coordinate of the particle due to the jump .    for our simulations",
    ", we set @xmath18 . using @xmath19 lattices ,",
    "we initialize the system with random configurations of various particle densities and carry out runs ranging from @xmath20 to @xmath21 mcs . after allowing @xmath22 mcs for the system to settle into a steady state , we measure the fourier transforms of @xmath23 every @xmath24 mcs , defining them in the usual way : @xmath25 in the literature , the term `` structure factor '' typically refers to the ( ensemble- or time- ) average of density - density operators in momentum space , i.e. , @xmath26 where @xmath27 ; @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the volume . instead of the overall averages , we construct histograms for @xmath30 , @xmath31}v$ ] and @xmath32}v$ ] from their time series in the steady state .",
    "we will use the somewhat loose term `` structure factors '' for these fluctuating quantities themselves . by symmetry , @xmath30 and @xmath33",
    "are distributed identically , and we consider only the former .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] for the smallest longitudinal and transverse wave vectors . before discussing the data",
    ", we will first present the theoretical framework within which they can be understood .",
    "being interested in the large distance ( small @xmath34 ) behavior , we may exploit the simplest approach , i.e. , to use coarse - grained equations of motions for the slowly varying local densities @xmath35 these can be considered as the naive continuum limits of the average lattice occupation numbers @xmath36 @xcite . for generality",
    ", we consider the d - dimensional case when @xmath37 is directed along the electric field and @xmath38 lies in the @xmath39 dimensional subspace transverse to the field .",
    "then the mean - field equations of motion for the charge densities follow as : @xmath40 here , @xmath41 is the diffusion matrix which is diagonal but not a simple multiple of the unit matrix , due to the anisotropies induced by the bias .",
    "@xmath42 is the asymmetric gradient operator , acting on any two functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 according to @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 is the coarse - grained bias and @xmath47 is the unit vector along the @xmath17 direction .",
    "the coefficients appearing in eqn .",
    "( [ meaf ] ) are functions of the microscopic control parameters ; however , their precise dependence need not be known .    to study small fluctuations in the disordered phase , we linearize ( [ meaf ] ) about the homogeneous time - independent solution @xmath48 and",
    "add conserved noise terms , to model the fast degrees of freedom .",
    "writing @xmath49 , we arrive at the langevin equations for the density fluctuations : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and summation over repeated indices is implied in ( [ rsl ] ) and in the following . here ,",
    "@xmath52 are gaussian white noise terms , satisfying : @xmath53 where @xmath27 ; @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the kronecker - symbol .",
    "@xmath56 is the noise matrix , and similar to @xmath41 , it is diagonal but not proportional to the unit matrix , due to the bias . to describe systems in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem would require @xmath57 . in particular , in the absence of the drive",
    ", we would have @xmath58 here . however , when driven , the proportionality is not expected to hold , since the diffusion and noise matrices are renormalized differently by the drive @xmath46 , similar to the driven single species case@xcite . finally , we point out that @xmath59 and @xmath60 are uncorrelated , due to the fact that charge exchange is not allowed .    introducing the fourier",
    "transforms for the density fluctuations ( and similarly for the noise ) @xmath61 the solution to ( [ rsl ] ) is trivial : @xmath62 where @xmath63 . according to the definition of the full dynamic structure factors @xmath64 \\equiv \\langle \\chi   ^\\alpha ( { \\bf k},\\omega ) \\chi ^\\beta ( { \\bf k}^{\\prime } , \\omega ^{\\prime   } ) \\rangle \\ ; ,   \\label{dyn_str_def}\\ ] ] we can integrate them over @xmath65 to obtain the steady state structure factors : @xmath66 \\equiv \\langle \\chi ^\\alpha ( { \\bf k},t)\\chi ^\\beta ( { \\bf k}%   ^{\\prime } , t)\\rangle \\;.   \\label{str_def}\\ ] ] note that they are just the fourier transforms of the usual _ equal - time _ correlation functions @xmath67 the explicit forms of the structure factors are : @xmath68 where . they clearly exhibit a finite discontinuity singularity at the origin , i.e. , @xmath69 which translates to power law decays in the spatial correlations . in particular , we find the expected @xcite power law , @xmath70 , related to @xmath71 , typical of non - equilibrium steady states of a system with anisotropy and subjected to a conservation law .",
    "in addition , a novel power , @xmath72 @xcite , controls correlations along the bias direction .",
    "next , we seek the _ full probability distributions _ of the density - density operators .",
    "thus , for each @xmath34 vector , we construct the distributions separately for @xmath73 , @xmath74}v$ ] and @xmath75}v$ ] , represented by @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 : @xmath79}v - s_r^{+-}\\right )   \\right\\rangle    \\label{prob_distr } \\\\",

    "also note that we used @xmath83 , since the densities @xmath84 are real .",
    "for our purposes , we need both , the density fluctuations and the explicit distribution of the noise , in the @xmath85 domain . within the linear stability regime of the disordered phase ,",
    "each matrix element of @xmath86 has two poles in the positive @xmath65 half - plane corresponding to two stable eigenvalues of @xmath87 .",

    "we start with the probability distribution of @xmath94 by first finding its characteristic function , i.e. , @xmath95 when performing the average in ( [ char++ ] ) , all integrations over the noise are trivial , except those associated with @xmath96 .",
    "thus , we need to evaluate the following integral : @xmath97\\;e^{i\\omega \\frac{\\chi ^{+}(t){\\chi ^{+}}^{*}(t)}v }   \\label{char++1}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the @xmath34 and @xmath100 components of the noise , respectively , yielding the only non - trivial integrations . inserting ( [ fluct_noise ] ) into ( [ char++1 ] )",
    ", we still have a gaussian integrand , controlled by the quadratic form : @xmath101 where the indices @xmath102 include all the degrees of freedom left over , namely , time , charge , and spatial component .",

    "we also emphasize that formulas ( [ prob++ ] ) and ( [ prob+- ] ) are completely independent of the specific model and can be derived in any multicomponent system .",
    "the only necessary conditions are linear langevin equations with gaussian noise .",
    "finally , let us turn to a comparison with the simulation results summarized in figure [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , for the two smallest wave vectors .",
    "the ` @xmath108 ' histograms show the usual exponential decay @xcite , while the ` @xmath134 ' histograms clearly represent asymmetric exponential distributions . to test the predictions of our gaussian theory , namely , that the slopes of the histograms are determined by the structure factor averages themselves , we simply measured these averages , i.e. , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "the ` @xmath108 ' case is particularly simple since the decay factor is just the inverse of @xmath135 itself . for the two @xmath134 distributions , we inserted the _ measured _ averages into the non - trivial _ theoretical _ relationship ( [ params ] ) , to find the decay factors latexmath:[$%     is remarkably good , indicating that linearized langevin equations are quite acceptable in this regime .",
    "while the external field , @xmath9 , may obviously generate renormalizations , these can be absorbed in the effective parameters of the theory , namely the diffusion matrix , the noise matrix , the average density and the coarse - grained bias , leaving the _ form _ of the structure factor distributions invariant .",
    "however , we must avoid critical fluctuations since the linear approximation will fail to capture their effects correctly .    to summarize",
    ", we have analyzed the full structure factor distributions in a simple driven lattice gas .",
    "due to the presence of two species , there are several distinct structure factor distributions here .",
    "all are simple exponentials , with the decay factors given in terms of the average structure factors .",
    "however , only the `` diagonal '' elements @xmath110 and @xmath139 are characterized by a _",
    "single _ decay factor , being distributions for a non - negative variable .",
    "in contrast , both @xmath140 and @xmath141 are combinations of _ two _ exponentials , with _ different _ decay factors , characterizing positive versus negative arguments , respectively . while this asymmetry may , at first sight , be rather surprising , its origin is quite easily traced to the presence of _ off - diagonal _ elements in the matrix @xmath142 , eqn .",
    "( [ det_matr ] ) .",
    "thus , the observation of asymmetric structure factor histograms , either in an experiment or a simulation , provides some basic insight into the form of the underlying langevin equation .",
