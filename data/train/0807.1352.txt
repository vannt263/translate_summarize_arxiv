    "the excitation spectrum of a bcs superconductor consists of an electron - like and a hole - like branch .",
    "while the two are equally populated in equilibrium , non - equilibrium states may have a ` branch imbalance ' .",
    "for example , if a superconductor is placed in an nsn junction as in the experiment of clarke @xcite , the injected quasi - particles can be primarily electron - like , and the electron - like branch more heavily populated than the hole - like branch in the steady state .",
    "superconducting wires , where branch imbalance arises at phase - slip centres @xcite , give another example .",
    "this imbalance suppresses the spectral gap @xcite . if large enough , it returns the system to the normal state , which is known to be unstable below @xmath0  this is the cooper instability .",
    "it was realized by galperin , kozub and spivak @xcite that the cooper instability is a limiting case of a more general instability which afflicts any state beyond a critical level of imbalance and results in oscillations of the order parameter .",
    "traditional approaches to the dynamics fail when the instability occurs , and for this reason the supercritical behavior of the superconductor is as yet unknown .",
    "it is important to resolve this , since situations in which large imbalance occurs are quite natural , for example in nsn junctions at large enough injection rate , or long superconducting wires held at sufficiently high voltage .",
    "this paper makes a step in this direction by treating the short - time dynamics in the limit where dissipative processes act slowly in comparison with the bcs dynamics ( in particular the oscillation of the gap ) .",
    "we work in the regime @xmath1 , when the slow relaxation of imbalance allows the system to reach a ` quasiequilibrium ' whose deviation from equilibrium can be characterized only by the amount of imbalance .",
    "we also assume the initial conditions are close to the unstable stationary solution , in a sense defined below .",
    "since the bcs dynamics are characterized by a time scale of order @xmath2 , the assumed separation of scales is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the time scale associated with energy relaxation . in a metallic superconductor with debye energy @xmath5 and @xmath6 , this gives only the unrestrictive @xmath7 .",
    "often one can avoid the complexities of the microscopic bcs dynamics of a superconductor with a simpler effective description such as the ginzburg - landau or the boltzmann kinetic equation .",
    "two time scales are important in deciding whether either is appropriate : the inelastic quasiparticle relaxation time , @xmath4 , and the time scale @xmath8 over which the order parameter varies significantly .",
    "when @xmath9 , the quasiparticle distribution rapidly reaches a local equilibrium characterized by the order parameter @xmath10 , with dynamics described by the ginzburg - landau equations for @xmath11 .",
    "we are interested in the opposite limit , @xmath12 , which is usually tackled with the boltzmann kinetic equation @xcite for the quasiparticle distribution function @xmath13 : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the energy of a quasiparticle state and the functional @xmath16 accounts for impurity scattering and collisions between electrons or between electrons and phonons",
    ". the kinetic equation must be supplemented with the self- consistency equation , which determines @xmath17 and thus the quasiparticle energies : @xmath18 here @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the chemical potential , and @xmath21 the bcs coupling constant .",
    "in addition there is a ` neutrality condition ' involving the phase @xmath22 of the order parameter .",
    "this condition arises from the continuity equation and ensures the conservation of charge ",
    "it is independent of ( [ boltzmann ] ) in the case of a superconductor . in the spatially homogeneous case ,",
    "if we define @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the electric potential ) and @xmath25 , it takes the form @xmath26 this integral quantifies the branch imbalance . the electron- and hole - like branches",
    "are distinguished by the sign of @xmath27 . in equilibrium",
    "the two branches are identically populated since the quasiparticle energy ( @xmath28 ) is even in this quantity , and @xmath29 vanishes .",
    "it is important that while branch imbalance is absent in equilibrium , its relaxation rate @xmath30 diverges as @xmath0 is approached @xcite : @xmath31 .",
    "( this is in the absence of oscillations of the gap , and assuming relaxation due to electron - phonon collisions @xcite . )",
    "thus when @xmath32 , the quasiparticle distribution reaches a ` quasiequilibrium ' on a time of order @xmath4 , characterized by distinct chemical potentials for the separately equilibrated hole - like and electron - like branches @xcite . this distribution is given below ( [ npwithimbalance ] ) .",
    "inserting it into the self - consistency equation ( [ selfconsist ] ) reveals that imbalance suppresses the gap relative to @xmath33 , its value when @xmath34 : @xmath35 , the gap is completely suppressed , and the system is returned to the unstable normal state .",
    "the instability appears earlier , at an intermediate value @xmath36 .",
    "the boltzmann description can not handle the system after the instability takes hold , as modes are excited in which cooper pairs posses non - zero relative phases ( the relative phases of the @xmath37 , in the language of anderson pseudospins @xcite ) .",
    "only the overall phase of the condensate is retained in the boltzmann approach , effectively restricting the system to a subclass of solutions where the cooper pairs precess in phase .    in this situation",
    "we must return to the gorkov equations describing the mean - field dynamics of the individual cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "we study here only the limit in which dissipative processes are neglected ( @xmath38 ) and the dynamics controlled purely by the bcs hamiltonian .",
    "this was done for the cooper instability by barankov , levitov and spivak in @xcite , yielding a ` soliton train ' of peaks in the gap .",
    "the problem was further discussed by warner and leggett in @xcite , by barankov and levitov in @xcite , and by yuzbashyan and dzero in @xcite .",
    "the integrability of the mean - field bcs system was established by yuzbashyan , altshuler , kuznetsov and enolskii in the papers @xcite and a general framework for addressing its dynamics was developed , which we use here to tackle the more involved case of imbalance .",
    "we confine ourselves to the integrable bcs hamiltonian because it can be treated analytically ; it was however shown by barankov and levitov in @xcite for the case of the cooper instability that the gap oscillations survive the breaking of integrability .",
    "our results show the emergence of oscillatory behavior at the instability point . on much larger time scales ( @xmath39 )",
    "dissipation will modulate the form of these oscillations and determine the final fate of the system .",
    "such an analysis is beyond the scope of this paper , but the solutions we present may be thought of as candidates to be found either at very large times after the onset of the instability or at intermediate times on the way to the asymptotic behavior , and are a first step in calculating the long - time behavior .",
    "we discuss this briefly in section [ conclusion ] .    the ability to ` switch on ' the pairing interaction in ultracold trapped gases via tunable feshbach resonances",
    "@xcite means that one might hope to observe the oscillations of the order parameter directly in the case of the cooper instability @xcite . on the other hand , it is not clear whether one could create imbalance in a sufficiently controlled fashion to observe the instability it creates .",
    "in contrast , imbalance can be created easily in metals , for example in tunnel junctions @xcite . here",
    "the direct observation of the collisionless dynamics is unlikely due to short dissipation times , and its significance is instead in its effect on processes at longer timescales such as the relaxation of imbalance .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ gorkoveqns ] presents the equations of motion for the system and the relevant initial conditions , and includes the final result of the analysis .",
    "section [ elements ] describes the formal solution to bcs dynamics @xcite , which is applied to the relevant case in section [ solutionwhereimbalance ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the system of equations describing the bcs superconductor in the non - dissipative regime were derived by volkov and kogan @xcite in the keldysh green s function formalism : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is defined by the following keldysh green s functions : @xmath42 { \\rangle}\\nonumber\\\\ s_- ( \\xi ) =     { \\langle}[c_\\uparrow(\\xi ) , c_\\downarrow(\\xi )   ] { \\rangle}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath43 , and : @xmath44 this system of equations can be derived from a classical hamiltonian : @xmath45 this is the mean - field bcs hamiltonian written in terms of anderson pseudo - spins , with an up ( resp .",
    "down ) spin representing a full ( empty ) cooper pair .",
    "singly - occupied pairs decouple from the order parameter dynamics ( as can be seen from the bcs hamiltonian which involves only pair - to - pair scattering ) and correspond to zero - length spins .",
    "one may derive the gorkov equations heuristically as a mean - field approximation to the bcs hamiltonian .",
    "the current paper aims to present solutions of ( [ volkovkogan ] ) for imbalanced superconductors , using the approach of @xcite . before doing so , let us recall the instability of the stationary solutions of ( [ volkovkogan ] ) in the presence of imbalance which was pointed out in @xcite .",
    "generally , stationary solutions of ( [ volkovkogan ] ) have the form : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the quasi - particle distribution function , which in the presence of imbalance is that is smooth on the scale of the level spacing .",
    "justification for the use of thermally averaged initial conditions is given in @xcite : we can average our spins over a small energy range containing many levels to give a smooth @xmath47 without changing the equations of motion ( [ volkovkogan ] , [ selfconsist ] ) . ]",
    "@xcite @xmath48 which is a fermi - dirac distribution for the quasi - particles , with different chemical potentials for the hole - like and electron - like spectral branches implemented by the term @xmath49 in the exponent .",
    "@xmath29 parametrizes the amount of imbalance in the system .",
    "the expression for @xmath47 is valid when @xmath50 .",
    "the self consistency condition ( [ selfconsist ] ) is satisfied if @xcite : @xmath51 in the absence of imbalance ( for the case @xmath34 ) .",
    "thus imbalance between electron - like and hole - like excitations suppresses the order parameter ) one solves the self - consistency equations with ( [ npwithimbalance ] ) .",
    "the self - consistency condition is dominated by spins in the energy range @xmath52 , where ( [ npwithimbalance ] ) is valid . ] .",
    "one can easily see that the distribution is unstable when @xmath53 , and @xmath54 by ( [ gapsuppression ] ) . at this point",
    "it becomes @xmath55 which is nothing but the quasi - particle distribution of a normal fermi gas in the excitation representation , where an artifical distinction between hole - like and electron - like excitations is made at @xmath56 .",
    "so , the peculiar form of ( [ normalindisguise ] ) is an artifact of the excitation representation , and it just describes a normal metal placed at @xmath57 .",
    "the cooper instability of this metal presents itself as a instability of the stationary solution of equation ( [ volkovkogan ] ) .    at @xmath34",
    "however the solution is stable , and represents the equilibrium superconducting state .",
    "there must therefore be an onset of instability at some finite @xmath29 intermediate between @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in order to find this point and in order to give a quantitative characterization of the instability , a linear stability analysis was performed around this solution in @xcite , looking for the presence of an unstable mode @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "this leads to an integral equation for @xmath62 : @xmath63 here @xmath64 .",
    "the solutions of this equation were found to be : @xmath65 becomes positive at @xmath36 .",
    "when the imbalance completely suppresses the gap ( [ gu=0 ] ) agrees well with the usual cooper instability case .",
    "in fact all we shall need in the following are the orders of magnitude of the the following quantities : @xmath66 where @xmath67 , and we have also defined the parameter @xmath68 , the rate of instability , an important parameter which will appear frequently below .",
    "the order of magnitude of the different quantities could just as well have been taken from the cooper instability case , as they remain the same when the imbalance completely suppresses the gap .",
    "namely these orders of magnitude are not sensitive to the exact form of the distribution function , but rather to gap suppression and may be viewed as consequences of eq .",
    "( [ gapsuppression ] ) .",
    "the main result of the following analysis is the time dependence of the order parameter following a perturbation from the unstable stationary solution .",
    "this is a train of ` solitons ' each of the form : @xmath69 where @xmath70 ( as opposed to @xmath71 ) denotes the value of the order parameter , which we can take to be real and positive , in the stationary but unstable initial state .",
    "the solitons are separated in time by a period that increases logarithmically with the smallness of the perturbation , @xmath72 in the notation used below .",
    "@xmath22 is a real constant ( see below ) which does not affect the qualitative nature of the soliton .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath73 consists in fast ( at frequency @xmath74 ) ocillations within an envelope given by @xmath75 .",
    "when @xmath76 ( recall that as @xmath77 we return to the finite - temperature normal metal ) this formula gives a soliton of the same shape as that found in @xcite for the order parameter oscillations associated with the cooper instability . in the opposite limit where the instability is small and @xmath78",
    ", we find instead pulses of oscillations of @xmath73 during which the value of @xmath73 averaged over over a period of the fast oscillation rises : @xmath79 .",
    "the instability discovered by galperin et al . shows that at large times dissipation may take the system to a new state which is very different to the initial stationary solution .",
    "a similar situation exists when a normal metal is placed at @xmath57 . for comparison we briefly review here the known results on this instability , the current paper expounding on these results to include the case where imbalance is present .",
    "a normal metal at @xmath57 is unstable against the development of a gap ( this is the celebrated cooper instability ) .",
    "the short term dynamics of the system , just after the instability takes hold , consist in an oscillatory behavior of @xmath70 .",
    "these oscillations damp out at large times because of dissipation ( this process is not described by the pure bcs hamiltonian ) and the material is left in the superconducting state .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of @xmath70 consists of a ` soliton train ' which can be found by solving ( [ volkovkogan ] ) for a system placed near the normal metal state ",
    "namely with initial conditions ( [ stationaryfg ] ) , where @xmath80 is the fermi distribution function plus a small perturbation .",
    "this is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the soliton train describes the short - time ( @xmath81 ) behavior of the order parameter following the onset of the cooper instability .",
    "a similar analysis will be presented here for the case when the initial state is given by ( [ stationaryfg ] ) and ( [ npwithimbalance ] ) , i.e. a superconductor with branch imbalance near @xmath0 .",
    "we study the behavior of the system after a small perturbation is added to @xmath47 .",
    "this describes the short time behavior after the instability has taken hold .",
    "the approach also yields solutions where the perturbation is rather larger .",
    "we believe that these solutions may provide further intuition about the possible routes the system may take once dissipation effects are taken into account .    in order to find these solutions",
    "we apply the formalism developed in @xcite for the dynamics of the mean field bcs system , which draws heavily on the theory of integrable systems .",
    "we shall establish the notation and present the main concepts of the derivation , referring the reader interested in further details to the original papers . in these papers",
    "the spectrum is treated as discrete  here we assume a continuous spectrum .",
    "an important object in the integrable structure is the lax matrix of the system , a @xmath82 matrix depending on a complex parameter @xmath83 , given by : @xmath84 where : @xmath85 for any @xmath83 , the matrix @xmath86 is time dependent via @xmath87 , but its eigenvalues are not  a key to integrability .",
    "these eigenvalues constitute an infinite set of constants of motion .",
    "they are labeled @xmath88 , and given by : @xmath89 the analytic structure of @xmath88 is as follows : in general @xmath88 has branch cuts , with square root behavior around the branch points , parallel to the imaginary @xmath83 axis , as well as a jump discontinuity on the real axis , on the support of the spectrum .",
    "the branch points @xmath90 satisfy @xmath91 .",
    "other important quantities are the zeros of @xmath92 , dubbed @xmath93 : @xmath94 .",
    "an important simplification takes place if one is interested only in the long time behavior of the system ( but still at times @xmath81 ) . after an initial transient",
    "the system exhibits periodic or quasi - periodic behavior whose frequency is dictated by the branch points of @xmath88 .",
    "the jump discontinuity is only relevant for the initial transient .",
    "the oscillatory behavior following the transient is captured by a simpler system containing only a finite number of spins @xmath95 , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the number of branch cuts in @xmath88 .",
    "the system with a finite number of spins is integrable , with a similar integrable structure to the infinite system , integrals being replaced by sums ; namely if @xmath98 are substituted into ( [ laxmat ] ) then the eigenvalues of the matrix are constants of motion .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath99 , and also a degree @xmath100 polynomial @xmath101 with zeros at @xmath90 , through @xmath102 .",
    "the appearance of @xmath103 signals the relevance of the algebraic riemann surface defined by the curve @xmath104 to this problem . to find the configuration of the finite number of spins at",
    "any given time one must know @xmath101 , which is independent of time , and the time - dependent quantities @xmath105 , defined by @xmath106 .",
    "[ overview ]    to find the dependence of the @xmath93 on time , it is best to make use of the connection of integrable systems and riemann surfaces .",
    "a central theme in the study of riemann surfaces are the cycles , which are the non - trivial closed curves on the riemann surface ( those that can not be smoothly shrunk to a point )",
    ". they will be denoted by @xmath107 and @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "these cycles are depicted in fig .",
    "[ cyclesfig ] .",
    "another mainstay of the theory of riemann surfaces are the abelian ( meromorphic ) differentials on the surface .",
    "the so - called differentials of the first kind , which are everywhere holomorphic , form a @xmath110 dimensional vector space for which a basis is : @xmath111 the differentials may be integrated around the non - trivial cycles to assist in the following definitions : @xmath112 a familiar construction for genus one riemann surfaces , which have the topology of a torus , allows us to represent the surface as a rectangle with opposite edges identified .",
    "the rectangle is characterized by its aspect ratio , which is an invariant of the riemann surface as well . in the case of genus one",
    "the aspect ratio of the rectangle turns out to be equal to @xmath113 from ( [ cyclesdefinitions ] ) .",
    "when the genus is higher than one we encounter a matrix , @xmath114 , which is a generalization of the number @xmath114 of the genus-1 case . the rectangle with opposite sides identified also has an analogue for higher genera : it is replaced by @xmath115 ( real ) dimensional volume in @xmath116 given by @xmath117 .",
    "this @xmath115 dimensional volume is an analog of the @xmath118 dimensional rectangle in the genus-1 case , in that there exists an invertible map taking sets of points on the riemann surface into it .",
    "this is given by @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the space of sets of @xmath110 points @xmath121 ( these are not ordered sets , so permutations are considered equivalent ) : @xmath122 the space @xmath123 is called the jacobian .",
    "the contour of integration from the arbitrary initial point @xmath124 to the point @xmath83 can wind around any of the cycles any number of times , so as a mapping to @xmath116 it is only defined up to the addition of an element of the lattice @xmath125 .",
    "this is however enough to give a well - defined map to @xmath126 .",
    "one can check that in the case of genus one the mapping takes a point on the riemann surfaces and maps it onto a rectangle whose aspect ratio is @xmath127 , the rectangle being represented by @xmath128 .",
    "the concept of the jacobian is particularly important in the solution of the problem because one can show that the zeros of @xmath92 , which are denoted by @xmath93 , satisfy the equation : @xmath129 where we have now written the time dependence of @xmath93 explicitly , while the @xmath130 are defined by : @xmath131 the roots @xmath90 of @xmath101 are listed for our case in ( [ es ] ) . considered as constants of integration for the dynamics of the @xmath110 roots @xmath105 of @xmath92 , the @xmath130 are @xmath110 free complex variables determining the initial values @xmath132 .",
    "however , not all initial values are permissible , i.e. an arbitrary @xmath133 will not correspond to a configuration of the spins ; there are @xmath110 constraints on @xmath133 .    the @xmath93 together with the spectral curve @xmath101 contain all the information needed to find the configuration of the spins .",
    "the problem of finding the @xmath93 is thus the problem of inverting the map @xmath134 .",
    "this is a solved mathematical problem with a long history , which goes by the name ` the jacobi inversion problem ' @xcite .",
    "the solution can be obtained in terms of the riemann @xmath135-function .",
    "we are interested here in the order parameter , whose logarithmic derivative in time is given by @xmath136 .",
    "the explicit solution of the inversion problem for bcs dynamics is presented in @xcite , and gives the time dependence of the order parameter as : @xmath137 provided that @xmath138 and @xmath139 are given by : @xmath140 the frequency @xmath141 can be written in terms of the roots @xmath90 of @xmath101 as @xmath142 .",
    "in the stationary ( but unstable ) imbalanced state , @xmath143 and @xmath144 are given by the expressions ( [ stationaryfg ] ) and ( [ npwithimbalance ] ) .",
    "in this case , the eigenvalue @xmath88 is given by : @xmath145 throughout we use @xmath70 ( as opposed to @xmath146 ) to denote the value of the gap before the perturbation .",
    "@xmath147 , which was defined in ( [ gu=0 ] ) because it appeared in the linear stability analysis , has appeared again as a common factor in @xmath148 .",
    "this is not a coincidence  the connection between roots of @xmath88 and modes present in the solution is explained further in @xcite . since @xmath149 has six roots",
    "we are led to consider the three spin problem , which according to the arguments of the previous section represents the dynamics of the order parameter after an initial transient .",
    "the polynomial @xmath101 for the three - spin problem has the same roots as @xmath149 , given thus by : @xmath150 ( here we have shifted @xmath83 by @xmath29  from the equations of motion in @xcite we see that this can be compensated by giving the order parameter an additional phase factor . ) @xmath101 has a very particular structure , related to the fact that it is a stationary solution .",
    "it has single roots only at @xmath151 and the rest of its roots are double roots .",
    "this insures that the riemann surface given by @xmath152 is of genus @xmath58 .",
    "we now wish to perturb the initial conditions .",
    "unless we fine - tune the perturbation to avoid doing so , we will lift the degeneracy associated with the double roots : the polynomial @xmath101 will now have @xmath153 single roots ( which must still occur in complex conjugate pairs , since @xmath154 has real coefficients ) : @xmath155 for the integrals in ( [ c ] ) , ( [ d ] ) we need the definitions ( fig . [ cyclesfig ] ) : @xmath156 we neglect here ( for example ) the small shift in the position of the pair of roots around the origin : whereas the splitting of the double roots has a qualitative effect , such shifts have negligible effect on the solution , involving only small shifts in the parameters @xmath70 , @xmath68 and @xmath29 , and a small change in the overall rate at which the phase of the order parameter rotates .",
    "also , while in general @xmath157 can be complex , in the regime of interest to us the solution is not sensitive to the phase of @xmath157 except through the value of @xmath133 . in the following we treat @xmath157 as real unless otherwise stated .",
    "after the perturbation the riemann surface is of genus two and @xmath146 is given by ( [ thetafunctionexpression ] ) with genus two hyperelliptic @xmath135-functions .",
    "the expression is quite formidable , yet certain features can be clarified without much analysis .",
    "most notably , the solution is quasi - periodic , with quasi - periods which can be deduced straightforwardly from the general periodicity properties of @xmath135 -functions together with the particular form the matrices @xmath62 and @xmath114 take in this case .    before continuing to the analysis of the small perturbation case",
    ", we note that if the perturbation is large enough it can lead to the appearance of new roots for @xmath101 , and to higher spin solutions ( with higher genera )  this case is too general for us to say much about .",
    "we assume that the parameter @xmath157 is small , as discussed in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "we then take the leading order in @xmath157 of the expressions for the matrices @xmath114 and @xmath158 , which figure in ( [ thetafunctionexpression ] ) .",
    "we also expand in @xmath159 , taking the lowest order terms for each element .",
    "then we have , to leading order ( in practice we must make sure lower order terms do not contribute ) : @xmath160    @xmath161    we will return to the vector @xmath162 , which requires further analysis .",
    "the period matrix @xmath114 is seen to have very large and very small elements on the diagonal , diverging or vanishing with @xmath163 .",
    "because of this the @xmath135-function is well approximated by trigonometric functions .",

    "this is done via the identity : @xmath165 which results in a ` transformed ' @xmath114-matrix , @xmath166 once the @xmath135-function has been written in terms of a @xmath114 matrix with only large elements , its degeneration into trigonometric functions is easily obtained from the definition of the @xmath135-function in terms of an infinite sum , @xmath167 the dominant terms in the sum will come from the @xmath168 close to the the stationary point of the real part of the exponent : @xmath169 ( @xmath170 is not necessarily a vector of integers ) . when @xmath171 deviates much from @xmath170",
    "the exponential becomes rapidly smaller because of the largeness of @xmath114 , such that the sum is dominated by only a few exponential terms  a ( hyper- ) trigonometric polynomial . because @xmath114 is logarithmic in @xmath157 and appears linearly in the exponentials , the sub - dominant terms in the sum will be suppressed by powers of @xmath157 .      by setting @xmath172",
    "we completely suppress the gap , returning the system to the normal - metal state . in this limit",

    "this behaviour corresponds to a simpler two - spin solution .",
    "this degeneration into a system described by fewer spins ( or lower - genus @xmath135-functions ) is expected whenever we close a branch cut on the riemann surface for @xmath101 ( here that joining the roots at @xmath151 ) , so long as the initial conditions are such that there is a @xmath93 pinned at the resulting double root ( here @xmath174 ) @xcite .",

    "we omit these formulas . then the @xmath210 are given by @xmath232 defining @xmath233 , all the @xmath234s and @xmath235s disappear in favor of @xmath236s , and we can expand without worrying about the relative size of @xmath234 versus @xmath235 : @xmath237 since @xmath238 , this tells us that @xmath239 to leading order , and that is real and the centers of the branch cuts do not move . ]",
    "@xmath240 is of order @xmath241 .",

    "having derived these results by expanding @xmath92 , @xmath182 and @xmath101 , we must ask when they are valid .",
    "assuming that @xmath245 is approximately of order one , we find that the roots of @xmath92 move a distance of order @xmath246 .",
    "this quantity must be much smaller than @xmath68 , the scale on which our initial polynomials vary .",
    "so a necessary condition for the validity of these approximations is @xmath247 this excludes of course the cooper instability case , where one root of @xmath92 is a distance of order @xmath29 from the start - points of the integrals in ( [ is ] ) .",
    "since @xmath92 vanishes as @xmath248 , in this case it is not legitimate to assume that @xmath249 .",
    "again we use the ` transformed ' @xmath135-functions , and extract the dominant exponentials from the sums defining them , ( [ thetafunctionexpansion ] ) .",
    "the precise values of @xmath133 depend on the nature of the perturbation , but the information obtained above is enough to establish the nature of the solution up to ( a ) an overall shift in time and ( b ) a shift of the fast oscillations within their envelope . up to such a shift , each soliton has the form ( we neglect @xmath241 corrections ) : @xmath250 and solitons occur at intervals of @xmath251 .    more explicitly , taking into account the expressions for the shifts in terms of @xmath133 ,",
    "the first soliton has the form @xmath252 from ( [ is],[z ] ) , @xmath253 is of order @xmath254 , so that if @xmath157 is sufficiently small the first soliton takes about half a period to appear .",
    "we have found the short - time behavior of a bcs superconductor following a small perturbation to the imbalanced initial conditions given by eq .",
    "[ npwithimbalance ] .",
    "these initial conditions show a suppression of the gap @xcite with increasing imbalance @xmath29 , and an instability @xcite when @xmath255 which becomes the celebrated cooper instability when the gap is fully suppressed . as @xmath29 is increased beyond @xmath36 , the gap oscillations following upon the instability grow in magnitude .",
    "they take the form of a train of solitons , each of duration @xmath256 and magnitude @xmath257 , and containing oscillations on the shorter timescale @xmath258 ( eq . [ gap2 ] , and pictured in fig .",
    "[ overview ] ) .",
    "these oscillations should be observable if appropriate initial conditions can be prepared in a controlled fashion .",
    "a stronger motivation for the work is that the oscillatory behavior is relevant to evolution on longer time scales ( @xmath259 ) in experimental situations with large imbalance . in particular , the oscillations are relevant to the relaxation of the imbalance , which in the absence of the instability occurs at a rate which vanishes with the gap as @xmath260 @xcite . understanding the short - time dynamics of ( [ volkovkogan ] ) is a first step ; to determine quantitatively what happens on long time scales it is necessary to compute how collisions modulate them .",
    "the moduli of the solution , i.e. the variables used to parameterize the kinds of short time behavior , can be taken to be the roots of @xmath101 .",
    "these roots or moduli vary slowly with time on account of collisions .",
    "the non - equilibrium state of the system at long times may correspond for example either to an unchanging set of moduli , or to a limit cycle in moduli space .",
    "such an analysis is beyond the scope of the current paper , but will involve ( [ gap2 ] ) and possibly generalizations .    our explicit expressions for the behavior of the order parameter apply when @xmath261 . in this limit , where the solitons are widely spaced",
    ", the expressions simplify greatly ; but the generalization to larger @xmath157 may be necessary to treat imbalance relaxation in realistic situations . as an idealized gendankenexperiment , our limit can be realized by instantaneously injecting electrons at the fermi level to a system at the instability point ",
    "it can be shown using the definition ( [ specpol ] ) that such a perturbation increases the instability rate @xmath68 while hardly increasing @xmath157 ) , rather than the details of the distribution of the spins . ] .",
    "( a similar analysis shows that in a system with tunable interaction strength , increasing the coupling of a system with @xmath262 does the same . )",
    "the subsequent evolution of such systems on time scales @xmath4 may increase @xmath157 further .",
    "the present work neglects spatial inhomogeneities . whether they change the picture qualitatively in systems larger than the coherence length remains to be investigated .",
    "gap oscillations can also parametrically excite inhomogeneous modes , as shown in @xcite for the cooper instability .",
    "we have already mentioned that thermal processes act by slowly perturbing the dynamics considered .",
    "we have not mentioned thermal fluctuations in the initial conditions , which were analysed for the cooper instability in @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations disappear when the level spacing , or the effective level spacing in a coherence length , goes to zero , but will cause variations in the parameters of the solution ( e.g. our @xmath157 ) when it is finite . while the evolution is of the same form in each realization , it was shown that variations in the parameters between different realizations are qualitatively important for averages ( e.g. of the absolute value of the gap ) over realizations .",
