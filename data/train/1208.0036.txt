    "in many decision problems a set of alternatives is evaluated with respect to a set of points of view , called criteria .",
    "for example , in evaluating a car one can consider criteria such as maximum speed , price , acceleration , fuel consumption . in evaluating a set of students one can consider as criteria the notes in examinations with respect to different subjects such as mathematics , physics , literature and so on . in general , evaluations of an alternative with respect to different criteria can be conflicting with respect to preferences .",
    "for example , very often when a car has a good maximum speed , it has also a high price and a high fuel consumption , or if a student is very good in mathematics , may be not so good in literature .",
    "thus , in order to express a decision such as a choice from a given set of cars or a ranking of a set of students , it is necessary to aggregate the evaluations on considered criteria , taking into account the possible interactions .",
    "this is the domain of multiple criteria decision analysis and in this context several methodologies have been proposed ( for a collection of extensive state - of - art surveys see @xcite ) .",
    "suppose to have n criteria @xmath0 and that on each of them the evaluation of a given alternative @xmath1 is expressed by a single number ( on the same scale ) .",
    "thus , such an alternative can be identified with a score vector @xmath2 , where @xmath3 represents the evaluation of @xmath1 with respect to the @xmath4 criterion .",
    "if the criteria are independent , a natural way to aggregate the @xmath5 is using the weighted arithmetic means @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 . when the criteria are interacting the weighted arithmetic means",
    "must be substituted with non additive operators . in the last years , several non additive integrals",
    "have been developed in order to obtain an aggregated evaluation of @xmath1 , say @xmath9 ( for a comprehensive survey see @xcite ) . among them",
    "we remember the choquet integral @xcite , the shilkret integral @xcite and the sugeno integral @xcite .",
    "all these integrals are computed with respect to a capacity @xcite or fuzzy measure @xcite allowing the importance of a set of criteria to be not necessarily the sum of the importance of each criterion in the set .",
    "it can be smaller or greater , due respectively to redundancy or synergy among criteria .",
    "these integrals can be used if the starting evaluations are exactly expressed ( on a numerical or ordinal scale ) . however , in the real life it is very simple to image situations where we have only partial informations about the possible evaluations on each criterion .",
    "specifically , on this paper we face the case of _ interval - evaluations_. for example , suppose a situation where , considering only two criteria , an alternative @xmath1 is evaluated between 5 and 10 on on the first criterion and between 7 and 20 on the second . again @xmath1 can be represented as a score vector @xmath10,\\left[7,20\\right]\\right)$ ] . using a generic aggregation operator @xmath11",
    ", it seems natural to aggregate separately the @xmath1 `` pessimistic '' evaluations @xmath12 and the `` optimistic '' ones , @xmath13 , in order to obtain an interval @xmath14 $ ] containing the global evaluation of @xmath1 . if we wish to obtain such a global evaluation , we should furthermore aggregate @xmath15 and @xmath16 into a single number .",
    "thus , the aggregation of interval evaluations into an exact evaluation should necessarily request two steps . in this paper",
    "we aim to synthesize these two processes into one single aggregating process . to this purpose",
    "we provide a quite natural generalization of the classical choquet , shilkret and sugeno integrals , which we call the _ robust _ choquet , shilkret and sugeno integrals computed wit respect to an _",
    "interval capacity_. roughly speaking , our integrals are special case of integrals of set valued functions @xcite .",
    "another question we face is that of order on the set of intervals .",
    "it is well known that the philosophy of the choquet integral applied to a given alternative is based on the ranking of the alternative evaluations on the various criteria .",
    "being these evaluations single numbers , their ranking agrees with the natural order of @xmath17 . in the case of interval evaluations , we have not a `` natural order '' to be preserved , like in @xmath17 .",
    "on the other hand we want that an evaluation on the range @xmath18 $ ] is considered better than an evaluation on the range @xmath19 $ ] and , then , some assumption about a primitive ordering on intervals must be done .",
    "one choice could be to assume the lexicographic order : @xmath20\\prec [ a',b']$ ] iff @xmath21 or @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the lexicographic order has the advantage to be a complete order , but it leads to the conclusion that @xmath24\\prec [ 3,4]$ ] , which we do not consider a suitable conclusion in the case of interval evaluations .",
    "instead , through this paper we shall assume as desirable order on intervals to be preserved that defined by considering an evaluation on the range @xmath20 $ ] better or equal than an evaluation on the range @xmath25 $ ] iff @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "+ finally , we wish to remember as in contrast to the fact that in real life decisions we often face imprecise evaluations , in multiple criteria decision analysis little has been developed in order to provide appropriate tools to aggregate such evaluations . in the best of our knowledge",
    "this question has been only partially treated in @xcite .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains the basic concepts . in section 3",
    "we give the definition of robust choquet integral ( rci ) computed with respect to an interval capacity . in section 4 we give an illustrative application of the rci , while in section 5 we provide a full axiomatic characterization of this integral . in section 6",
    "we explore the possibility of rewriting the rci by means of its mbius inverse . in section 7",
    "we give the definitions of robust sugeno and shilkret integrals and in section 8 we apply our generalization to other fuzzy integrals , among them to the concave integral of lehrer @xcite . in section 9",
    "we extend our discussion to the case of m - point intervals @xcite .",
    "in section 10 we present our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a set of _ alternative _ @xmath28 to be evaluated with respect to a set of criteria @xmath29 .",
    "suppose that for every @xmath30 , we have , on each criterion , a numerical imprecise evaluation .",
    "specifically , suppose that for each @xmath31 we know a range @xmath32 $ ] containing the exact evaluation of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath33 .",
    "thus , being @xmath34\\ |\\   a , b\\in{\\mathbb{r}},\\   a\\le b\\right\\}$ ] the set of bounded and closed intervals of @xmath17 , any alternative @xmath1 can be identified with a score vector @xmath35,\\ldots,\\ \\left[{\\underline{x}}_i,{\\overline{x}}_i\\right],\\ldots,\\left[{\\underline{x}}_n,{\\overline{x}}_n\\right]\\right)\\in\\mathcal i^n \\label{eq : vector}\\ ] ] whose @xmath4 component , @xmath36 $ ] , is the interval containing the evaluation of @xmath1 with respect to the @xmath4 criterion .",
    "vectors of @xmath37 are considered elements of @xmath38 by identifying each @xmath39 with the degenerate interval ( or singleton ) @xmath40=\\{x\\}$ ] .",
    "thus , with a slight abuse of notation , we write @xmath40=x$ ] .",
    "we associate to every @xmath41,\\ldots,\\left[{\\underline{x}}_n,{\\overline{x}}_n\\right]\\right)\\in \\mathcal i^n$ ] the vector @xmath42 of all the worst ( or pessimistic ) evaluations of @xmath1 on each criterion and the vector @xmath43 of all the best ( or optimistic ) evaluations of @xmath1 on each criterion .",
    "trough the paper , the elements of @xmath38 will be , indifferently , called alternatives or vectors .",
    "+ let us consider the set @xmath44 of all pairs of subsets of @xmath45 in which the first component is included in the second . with a slight abuse of notation we extend to @xmath46 the set relations of inclusion , union and intersection by defining for all @xmath47 : @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 regarding the algebraic structure of @xmath46 , we can observe that with respect to the relation @xmath51 , @xmath46 is a lattice , i.e. a partial ordered set in which every two elements have a unique supremum and a unique infimum .",
