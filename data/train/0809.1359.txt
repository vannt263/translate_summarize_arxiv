    "during the past decade , qcd - oriented studies have been shifting steadily toward exclusive channels . for a long time the electromagnetic structure of pions has been subjected to numerous experimental and theoretical investigations through the study of electroproduction reactions .",
    "extensive experimental studies of pion electroproduction reactions like @xmath4 or @xmath5 have been carried out in the past at cern , cornell , desy and more recently at jlab facility @xcite . since the mid-90s , kaon electroproduction reactions like @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the target , @xmath9 the produced hyperon and @xmath10 the recoil ) have also attracted renewed interest in nuclear physics at both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite level .",
    "the main ingredients for the description of electromagnetically induced kaon production are embedded in the so - called chew , goldberger , low and nambu ( cgln ) scattering amplitudes . in case of the longitudinal component of",
    "the electron induced unpolarized differential cross - section , the t - channel diagram dominates and ( in certain kinematic conditions ) can be factorized @xcite as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a kinematic factor , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are functions of the 4-momentum transfer squared @xmath2 of the virtual photon , the invariant mass @xmath16 and the mandelstam variable @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath18 implicitly contains the information about the electromagnetic form factor of the kaon .",
    "note that @xmath18 is not the actual form factor , but rather a complicated function from which the form factor can be extracted using e.g. , chew - low extrapolation and deconvolution algorithms .",
    "a precise knowledge of the form factor is of fundamental importance for a realistic and accurate description of _ exclusive reaction _ mechanisms and plays a key role in understanding the interplay between perturbative and non - perturbative physics at intermediate energies .",
    "moreover , the study of form factors provides direct insight into the electromagnetic structures and charge distributions of hadrons as they couple with photons .    to date",
    ", the electromagnetic kaon form factor is very poorly known and only measured at very low @xmath2 ( below @xmath19 @xmath20 ) @xcite .",
    "the status for the ( quasi - free ) lambda ( @xmath21 ) and sigma ( @xmath22 ) hyperons is even worse , i.e. , there are simply no available experimental data .",
    "basic quantities like the strong coupling constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 derived from purely hadronic processes or theoretical considerations are not well established and must be considered adjustable . recently",
    ", however , there appeared quite large and precise data sets on photo - production of kaons from the saphir ( elsa ) @xcite , clas ( cebaf ) @xcite and leps ( spring8 ) @xcite collaborations .",
    "there is also new data on electroproduction of positive kaons from experiment e98 - 108 at cebaf which are being analyzed at the moment .    keeping in mind the increasing accuracy of experimental data , an accurate theoretical description of the electromagnetic form factors of pseudo - scalar charged mesons at intermediate energies is of primal importance . to our knowledge , especially for the kaon there are very few theoretical works in this direction @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "in addition to the pion form factor , we analyze the kaon form factor for a broad range of space - like momentum transfer .",
    "our framework is based on resummed perturbative light - cone qcd formalism @xcite , unlike conventional approaches like `` asymptotic '' and lattice qcd or from sum rules that rely on many unchecked hypotheses .",
    "the experimental results could then be used to extract the various _ distribution amplitudes _ ( das ) @xcite used in the above formulation .",
    "of course , only a handful of experimental hadron electroproduction data points are presently available to make definitive statements on the validity of different theoretical approaches .",
    "since in almost all cases , the corresponding data points are merely concentrated in the very low energy region ( @xmath25 gev@xmath26 ) , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) has limited predictive power due to the rapidly growing magnitude of the strong coupling , as @xmath2 tends to zero . despite the existing plethora of literature on the predictions on electromagnetic meson form factors based on various approaches ( see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for the pion and refs .",
    "@xcite for kaon form factors , to give a highly incomplete list of references ) , till date there is considerable amount of debate as to their exact behavior in the phenomenological low and moderate energies between @xmath27-@xmath28 gev@xmath26 .",
    "nevertheless , we try to give our assessment to the existing scenario and try to explain the experimental data first for the pion form factor , where statistics are far more decent as compared to that of the kaon",
    ". then we extend our analysis to the kaon form factor , where experimental data is still too limited for any meaningful comparison .",
    "hopefully , with the planned 12 gev upgrade proposal of the cebaf experiment ( at jlab ) in the near future , studies of intermediate energy qcd can prove to be fruitful .",
    "the standard `` asymptotic '' qcd is known to make successful predictions of many phenomena like _ dimensional scaling , helicities , color transparency _ , etc .  for exclusive processes , as @xmath2 tends to infinity @xcite .",
    "the approach relies on the so - called _ collinear factorization _",
    "theorem @xcite which provides an outstanding way of isolating the partonic part accessible to pqcd from the non - perturbative parts .",
    "the basic ingredients are : ( a ) the hadron da @xmath29 , which encodes the non - perturbative information regarding the momentum distribution of the constituent `` near '' on - shell valence partons collinear to the hadron and also features of the qcd vacuum structure as expressed through the quark condensates @xcite , and ( b ) a scattering kernel @xmath30 , describing the hard scattering of `` far '' off - shell valence partons .",
    "the overall amplitude of the exclusive process is then given by the convolution , @xmath31 .",
    "however , the application of pqcd to exclusive processes at intermediate momentum transfers or phenomenologically accessible energies ( e.g. , at cebaf ) has been the subject of severe controversies and criticisms @xcite .",
    "it is widely anticipated that non - perturbative effects arising from soft gluon exchanges or from endpoint contributions to phenomenologically acceptable wave functions ( or das ) dominate and may severely preclude the predictability of pqcd .",
    "hence , in this paper we use a modified `` resummed '' pqcd formalism ( as proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite ) which is believed to largely enhance the predictability of pqcd in a self - consistent way at intermediate energies .",
    "the central issue here is the inclusion of transverse momentum @xmath0 dependence that necessitates the inclusion of a _ sudakov suppression _ factor .",
    "this is to organize the large double logarithms of the type @xmath32 , arising at all orders due to the overlap of soft and collinear contributions of radiative gluon loop corrections .",
    "such a resummation effectively suppresses the non - perturbative contributions at large energies .",
    "however , this may not still be effective enough when talking of @xmath2 down to a few gev@xmath26 .",
    "these facts are in agreement with some of the recent findings , reported in refs .",
    "@xcite for the pion form factor and also in the context of @xmath10 systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we emphasize the importance of including two distinct contributions to exclusive quantities for obtaining good agreement with experimental data at low and moderate energies : firstly , the non - factorizable soft contributions which are not calculable within the perturbative framework and secondly , the power suppressed corrections from non - leading twist structures ( twist-3 ) determining the preasymptotic behavior . in other words , the electromagnetic form factor @xmath33 for a charged meson @xmath34 should be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the factorizable part computable in pqcd and @xmath37 is the non - factorizable soft part . the soft contributions to the form factors",
    "can be calculated using phenomenological quark models either incorporating transverse structure ( momentum ) dependence of the hadron wave functions ( see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) or from qcd sum rules via _ local duality _ ( see e.g. , refs .  @xcite . ) in the present paper , we follow the latter approach .",
    "we also focus on the presence of non - perturbative enhancements arising from kinematic endpoint regions of the scattering kernel which tend to invalidate collinear factorization . for our calculations , we use model twist-2 and twist-3 light - cone wave functions incorporating transverse degrees of freedom , where the collinear das are derived from qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "naively , the twist-3 contributions to the form factor are expected to be small compared to leading ( twist-2 ) contributions as they have a relative @xmath38 suppression . on the contrary , the existing literature , either using model or asymptotic das @xcite",
    ", shows large twist-3 corrections to the pion form factor which even overshoot the twist-2 contributions in a wide range of low and intermediate energies .",
    "this is also confirmed in our analysis and is in fact more enhanced for the kaon form factor . to this end",
    ", our analysis shows good agreement with the existing pion data and in addition we prove the consistency of our results by adopting a scheme of analytization of the running strong coupling @xcite that removes the explicit landau singularity at @xmath39 by a minimum power correction in the uv regime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : das ] , we briefly discuss the idea of factorization and review the basic definitions of the twist-2 and twist-3 pseudo - scalar meson das and their renormalization evolutions . section  [ sec : form ] deals with the theoretical framework involved in calculating the space - like electromagnetic form factor . here , we recall the predictions of classic asymptotic qcd for large @xmath40 and how one needs to modify pqcd with collinear as well as `` @xmath0 '' factorization schemes including sudakov effects at intermediate energies . in section  [ sec : numerics ] , we provide the details of our numerical results for the pion form factor and compare it with the available experimental data .",
    "we also give a preliminary prediction for the kaon form factor , despite the lack of available experimental data for comparison in the desired phenomenological regime .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : concl ] contains our summary and conclusions .",
    "the appendices contain a compendium of relevant formulae used in our analysis .",
    "the parton model of describing exclusive processes in qcd inherently rest on the so - called _ frozen approximation _ ( @xcite ) . at high energies ,",
    "exclusive scattering amplitudes are dominated by hadronic fock states with essentially valence quark configurations ( @xmath41 in mesons ) .",
    "while the relative velocities of the participating hadrons are located closely to the null - plane , the internal hadron `` quantum - bindings '' processes are highly time - dilated with respect to the exclusive reaction time scales in the rest frames of the remaining hadrons .",
    "this effectively freezes the hadronic internal degrees of freedom as seen by the other hadrons .",
    "this incoherence between the long - distance intra - hadronic binding processes and the short - distance inter - hadronic scattering reaction is the very motivation for the idea of factorization .",
    "thus , the hadrons may be considered to be consisting of definite valence quark states denoted by a da of leading twist @xmath29 .",
    "the collinear factorization formula is then used to express exclusive quantities like the form factors as a convolution using the das : @xmath42 where @xmath43 . here ,",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 are , respectively , the ingoing and outgoing hadron momenta , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the longitudinal momentum fractions of the nearly on - shell valence quarks , @xmath48 is the renormalization scale and @xmath49 is the factorization scale which is defined as the scale below which the qcd dynamics are non - perturbative and remain implicitly encoded within the das , while the dynamics above are perturbative and must be retained in the hard kernel @xmath30 .",
    "the ellipses in the above equation represent contributions from higher order fock states and sub - leading twists which are all suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , they also include the non - factorizable soft contributions .",

    "the renormalization group ( rg ) equation for @xmath65 is known as the efremov - radyushkin - brodsky - lepage ( er - bl ) equation @xcite , @xmath70 with the integral kernel @xmath71 to leading order in @xmath72 given by @xmath73_+\\,,\\ ] ] where the `` + '' distribution is defined as @xmath74_+=v(x , y;\\alpha_s ) - \\delta(x - y)\\int^1_0 dt\\,v(t , y;\\alpha_s)\\,.\\ ] ] solving the above set of equations yields the multiplicative renormalization formula for moments @xmath75 to leading - logarithmic accuracy , @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 , while the lowest order anomalous dimensions are given by @xmath79 with the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function @xmath80 .",
    "note that for the pion all odd moments @xmath81 vanish due to isospin symmetry .",
    "in contrast , the kaon da have non - zero values for the odd moments signifying flavor - su(3 ) violation effects .",
    "hence , the twist-2 da for the kaon ( e.g. , @xmath82 ) is given by the expansion @xmath83 where the kaon decay constant @xmath84 @xcite is defined by @xmath85 the gegenbauer moments being multiplicatively renormalizable with growing anomalous dimensions , for sufficiently large renormalization scale a finite number of moments are relevant , albeit the fact that the higher order moments have large uncertainties in their present determination .",
    "hence , in all practical calculations , the series expansion of the das are truncated only to the first few moments . in this paper , we have adopted a model for the twist-2 das in truncating up to the second moment , as was done in refs .",

    "note that the gauge - link factors ( wilson line ( [ eq : wilson ] ) ) in the matrix elements are to be implicitly understood .",
    "the twist-3 das have the following asymptotic forms : @xmath90 with the normalization condition , @xmath91 for our analysis , we use the 2-particle twist-3 das from refs .",

    ", the asymptotic scaling behavior @xmath93 follows from the well - known dimensional `` quark counting '' while for small @xmath2 , the behavior is well described by the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model @xcite and given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 mev is a reasonable cut - off mass scale , showing no obvious trace of pqcd scaling behavior where there exists no high energy cut - off .",
    "hence , a thorough understanding of this transition behavior ( from nonperturbative to perturbative ) is of crucial importance in qcd for understanding the very nature of strong interaction and in providing a vivid picture of the underlying quark - gluon substructure of the mesons .    for a charged meson @xmath34 ( e.g. , @xmath96 ) ,",
    "the form factor is specified by the following matrix element : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the electromagnetic current with quark @xmath99 of flavor @xmath100 and charge @xmath101 . in this paper",

    "moreover , the available data itself has very low statistics at intermediate energy and is plagued with large uncertainties .",

    "hence , we do not show the experimental data points in the form factor plots . with the availability of better quality data in future",
    "there could be plenty of room for further improvements , for instance , extension of the above results to include a full nlo calculation for subleading twists or higher helicity and fock state contributions .",
    "for the past two decades the electromagnetic meson form factors have been the subject of intensive theoretical and experimental scrutiny and yet there is still to be an universally accepted framework for their description .",
    "presently , reliable experimental data are available only for the pions which are entirely concentrated at very low energies with very poor statistics at intermediate energies .",
    "the low energy part of the data is best explained by the standard vmd model , showing no apparent trace of pqcd behavior , which is expected only at very high energies .",
    "very many attempts have been made to predict the onset of the perturbative behavior for the pion form factor .",
    "the modified or resummed valence pqcd with factorization appears to show some attractive features to enable pqcd calculations to be valid in a self - consistent way even at very moderate energies . whether this is true ,",
    "will only be confirmed when data with better statistics at higher momentum transfers will become available in the future . at the same time , the onset of the perturbative behavior being very slow , it is still unclear whether the leading order perturbative calculations could be expected to be precise even at the highest accessible energies . in this paper , with the help of ( a ) the double - humped type das and ( b ) the modified transverse ( @xmath0 ) factorization scheme , incorporating both sudakov suppression and threshold resummation , we got rid of non - perturbative end - point enhancements .",
    "this enlarges the scope of applicability of resummed pqcd independent of the coupling scheme to a much wider range of intermediate energies , if not down to a few gevs , as demonstrated in this paper . by a simple adjustment of only the chiral enhancement parameter @xmath236 , a good agreement with the experimental data was obtained .    as for the scaled pion form factor",
    ", we found that the leading order pqcd contributions potentially undermine the agreement with the available low energy data and are only trustworthy in the hard energy regime : even from a very conservative point of view , @xmath2 should be bigger than 4 gev@xmath26 . at low momentum transfers ,",
    "the non - perturbative contributions dominate , being larger than the hard ( twist-2 ) contributions at least by a factor of two .",
    "in fact below 4 gev@xmath26 , 60 - 70@xmath237 of the available data is already accounted for by the soft contributions . in addition , we also needed the twist-3 power corrections to explain the remaining discrepancy .",
    "however , at larger energies ( say , @xmath238 - 100 gev@xmath26 ) , both the soft and the twist-3 contributions rapidly fall off and eventually the twist-2 form factor dominates asymptotically .",
    "similar conclusions , albeit being preliminary , are drawn for the kaon form factor although it seems that the onset of the perturbative behavior occurs at slightly larger momentum transfers than for the case of the pion .",
    "of course , as we mentioned earlier , it still remains to be investigated about the nature of the contributions that may arise from a full systematic nlo calculation with subleading twists and intrinsic transverse momenta , or from the inclusion of higher helicity and fock states . with the availability of better quality of data in future such analyses",
    "may be necessary to make definite conclusions .    in summary",
    ", although the quality of present experimental form factor data does not allow a definitive conclusion , one can expect that the non - perturbative soft contributions and higher twist power corrections to the form factors play an important role at phenomenologically accessible momentum transfers .",
    "thus , more work is needed to be done on both the theoretical and experimental sides to obtain more conclusive results and push the frontiers of our knowledge on confinement dynamics through the study of higher order and non - perturbative contribution to exclusive processes .",
